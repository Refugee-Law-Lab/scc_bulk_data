The King, [1951] S.C.R. 248\nDate: 1951-02-06\nFran\u00e7ois Rozon Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty The King Respondent.\n1950: November 14, 1951: February 6.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau, Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nCriminal law\u2014Manslaughter\u2014Operation of motor vehicle\u2014Verdict of criminal negligence\u2014Substituted by Court of Appeal for dangerous driving\u2014Whether dissent in Court of Appeal within section 1023(1) of Criminal Code\u2014Sections 285(6), 951(3), 1016(2) and 1023(1) of the Criminal Code.\nIn 1948, appellant was tried before a jury on a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle. The jury, implicitly acquitting him of that offence, returned a verdict of guilty of criminal negligence. The Court of Appeal was unanimously of the opinion that this verdict could not stand and the majority, therefore, basing itself on sections 1016(2), 951(3) and 285(6) of the Criminal Code, substituted a verdict of guilty of dangerous driving. The minority, expressing a doubt as to whether section 1016(2) applied and not wanting to speculate as to what the jury intended by their verdict, would have acquitted the accused.\nHeld: (Affirming the judgment appealed from) Locke and Cartwright JJ. dissenting, that the appeal should be dismissed as the dissent in the Court of Appeal was not on any ground of law dealt with by the majority, and upon which there was a disagreement in the Court of Appeal. (Expressing a doubt is not dissenting). Per the Chief Justice, Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: As an appeal under s. 1023(1) of the Criminal Code is limited to grounds of law alone, upon which there were points of difference in the Court of Appeal, and as the ground raised by the minority, assuming that it was a ground of law alone, was not considered by the majority because of the view they took of the case, there was, therefore, no disagreement in the Court of Appeal on a question of law alone and this Court has, consequently, no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\nPer Locke and Cartwright JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered as the Court of Appeal had no right to substitute a verdict of dangerous driving under 1016(2) since, because of errors in law in the charge, this verdict could not have stood even if the jury had found it.\nPer Locke and Cartwright JJ. (dissenting): To give this Court jurisdiction to entertain an appeal under s. 1023(1), it is not necessary that the dissenting judgment upon which the appeal is based proceeded upon a point of law with which the majority also dealt and upon which the majority and the dissenting judges were in disagreement, but it is sufficient under that section that (a) there be a dissenting judgment and (b) that a ground upon which such dissenting judgment is based be a question of law.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, substituting, Letourneau C.J.A. and Barclay J.A. dissenting, for a jury's verdict of guilty of criminal negligence a verdict of dangerous driving of an automobile pursuant to section 285 of the Criminal Code, affirming the sentence passed by the trial judge and dismissing the appeal.\nJean Drapeau for the appellant.\nNoel Dorion K.C. and Lucien Thinel for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau and Fauteux J.J. was delivered by\nFauteux J.\u2014The appellant has been charged with the offence of manslaughter, arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle on the 17th of October 1947, in the district of Terrebonne, Province of Quebec. On the 26th of October 1948, the jury, implicitly acquitting him of the major offence of manslaughter, returned a verdict expressed in the following terms: \"guilty of criminal negligence.\" The record does not disclose any objection being taken to the verdict, either as to its form or as to its substance, at the time it could have been corrected. About two weeks later, Rozon appealed to the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Division) 2 on questions of. law alone. There was no appeal on questions of fact or mixed law and fact nor was there any leave granted or even asked to appeal on such questions. Of the three grounds raised on law, one was that the accused having been indicted for manslaughter as the result of the operation of a motor vehicle, the verdict of criminal negligence was illegal.\nBy a majority judgment (St.-Jacques, Gagn\u00e9 and MacKinnon (ad hoc), JJ.), that appeal was dismissed; a verdict of reckless driving was substituted for the one expressed by the jury and the sentence imposed by the trial judge was allowed to stand. Mr. Justice Barclay, with the concurrence of the late Chief Justice L\u00e9tourneau, expressed a dissent clearly limited to the manner in which the appeal should be disposed of in view of the illegality of the verdict expressed by the jury: They would have allowed the appeal and quashed the conviction and the sentence. Thus, there was no dissent as to any of the grounds of appeal raised by the appellant in the Court below and, in point of fact, all the judges, as appears by the following excerpts from the reasons for judgment, agreed that the accused could not, on the indictment, be found guilty of criminal negligence. Mr. Justice St.-Jacques, in reference to the accused, said:\nIl soutient que depuis l'amendement apport\u00e9 en 1938, \u00e0 l'article 951 du Code Criminel, un verdict de n\u00e9gligence criminelle sous l'autorit\u00e9 de l'article 284 ne peut plus \u00eatre rendu. Ainsi formul\u00e9e, la proposition de l'appelant n'est pas discutable; il faut l'admettre comme bien fond\u00e9e.\nMr. Justice Gagn\u00e9:\nComme M. le Juge St.-Jacques et M. le Juge Barclay, dont j'ai eu l'avantage de lire les notes, je crois qu'en vertu des amendments adopt\u00e9s aux articles 951 et 285, en 1938, l'appelant ne pouvait pas \u00eatre condamn\u00e9 pour n\u00e9gligence criminelle.\nAnd, then, Mr. Justice MacKinnon:\nI am in agreement with the Hon. Messrs. Justices St.-Jacques, Barclay and Gagn\u00e9, whose notes I have had the opportunity of reading and for the reasons given by them that the appellant could not be found guilty of \"criminal negligence\" on this charge.\nThough no reference is made to ss. 2 of section 1016 of the Criminal Code, either in the formal judgment or in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice St.-Jacques who wrote it, it appears from the reasons for judgment delivered by the other members of the Court that the dissent is related to this section, in respect of which the only two questions considered were:\n1. Whether section 1016 ss. 2 is, in law, applicable to the case and, if it is,\n2. Whether or not, being applied, the substitution of verdict could properly be made in the light of the actual finding and the facts of the case.\nIt is convenient to quote ss. 2 of section 1016 and, then, relate the views expressed on the two points by the members of the Court.\n2. Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence and the jury or, as the case may be, the judge or magistrate, could on the indictment have found him guilty of some other offence, and on the actual finding, it appears to the Court of Appeal that the jury, judge or magistrate must have been satisfied of facts which proved him guilty of that other offence, the court of appeal may, instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal, substitute for the verdict found a verdict of guilty of that other offence, and pass such sentence in substitution for the sentence passed by the trial court as may be warranted in law for that other offence, not being a sentence of greater severity.\nMr. Justice St.-Jacques first deals with the facts of the case, then with the charge, and finally, without referring in terms to ss. 2 of section 1016, concludes, as in the formal judgment, that the jury, really intending to return a verdict of reckless driving, ill expressed themselves in wording it: \"guilty of criminal negligence.\" At page 150, the learned judge says:\nLorsque ce verdict a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu, le pr\u00e9sident du tribunal aurait pu ordonner au jury de le libeller, suivant la preuve et la direction donn\u00e9e, \u00e0 savoir: conduite dangereuse ou d\u00e9sordonn\u00e9e d'une automobile suivant les expressions que l'on retrouve au cours de la charge. Il ne l'a pas fait. Sans doute, parce que tout le monde a compris, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, qu'il s'agissait bien, malgr\u00e9 la r\u00e9daction du verdict, de l'offense pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'article 285.\nJe ne puis admettre que ce verdict doive \u00eatre cass\u00e9 et mis \u00e0 n\u00e9ant; il peut \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 dans sa r\u00e9daction, sans en affecter la substance qui ressort clairement, et de la preuve et de la charge du juge.\nMessrs. Justices Gagn\u00e9 and MacKinnon are clearly of the opinion that the section is applicable to the case and applying it, conclude that the substitution is justified by the finding and the facts of the case. Thus, at page 160, the former says:\nIl s'agit de savoir si cette Cour a le pouvoir de modifier le verdict pour le rendre conforme au paragraphe 6 de l'article 285. L'article 1016, paragraphe 2, nous le permet. And, having considered the address of the trial judge, he concludes, at page 163, to the substitution of a verdict:\nComme on le voit, le savant juge confond, dans les remarques qui suivent la lecture de l'article 285, par. 6, la n\u00e9gligence criminelle, ou coupable, et ce qu'il appelle la conduite d\u00e9sordonn\u00e9e d'une automobile. Mais, tout cela est en relation avec l'offense pr\u00e9vue au dit paragraphe qu'il a lu en entier.\nLe jury n'a pas pu comprendre qu'il puisse s'agir d'autre chose. L'expression employ\u00e9e au verdict est impropre, mais c'est bien l'offense de conduite dangereuse que le jury avait \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer, et c'est de cette offense qu'il a voulu d\u00e9clarer l'accus\u00e9 coupable.\nFinally, referring to the evidence, the learned judge says:\nCe qui s'est pass\u00e9 avant et apr\u00e8s l'accident, d'apr\u00e8s la preuve, et l'\u00e9tat du cadavre lorsqu'on l'a trouv\u00e9, d\u00e9montrent de fa\u00e7on tellement \u00e9vidente la culpabilit\u00e9 de l'appelant, que le jury n'a pas pu \u00eatre influenc\u00e9 par les quelques inexactitudes que signale le savant procureur.\nMr. Justice MacKinnon, at page 166, states:\nI consider that under Art. 1016, paragraph 2, C.C., this Court has the right to substitute for the verdict as found a verdict of guilty of an offence under paragraph 6 of Art; 285, C.C.\nAnd, at the same page, on the second point, he concludes :\nAs pointed out by the Hon. Messrs. Justices St.-Jacques and Gagn\u00e9, the judge in his address to the jury made no reference to Art. 284 which defines criminal negligence. He did however read to the jury paragraph 6 of Art. 285 C.C. which deals with reckless driving. To me it is evident that taking the judge's charge as a whole that he intended to direct the jury that it could bring in a verdict of guilty of manslaughter or reckless driving and that it was the offence of reckless driving which the jury considered when it found the appellant guilty of criminal negligence. For the reasons given by Messrs. Justices St.-Jacques and Gagn\u00e9, with which I concur, I would substitute for the verdict given a verdict of guilty of reckless driving and would allow the sentence to stand.\nFor the minority judges, Mr. Justice Barclay did not consider the facts at all. Dealing first with the second point, he concludes, at page 159:\n\u2026 With all these directions to the jury, I am of the opinion that speculation as to what they really intended would be most unfair to the accused.\nAnd, dealing then with the first point, he expresses a doubt:\nI am also very doubtful as to whether Article 1016-2 is applicable to the present case.\nAnd he ends his notes of judgment in saying:\nI consider therefore that we have no right to substitute any other verdict. On the alleged basis of this dissent and under the provisions of ss. 1 of section 1023, Rozon now appeals to this Court, formulating as follows his grounds of appeal:\n(a) The verdict of criminal negligence was illegal in view of the indictment for manslaughter resulting from an automobile accident against the appellant in the present case;\n(b) The Court of Appeal erred in substituting as it did a verdict of reckless driving to the verdict of criminal negligence rendered by the jury;\n(c) The Court of Appeal, for the reasons mentioned in the foregoing grounds of appeal, should have quashed the conviction.\nIt may, at first, be stated that the sole question of law, if any, on which a dissent may be suggested by the appellant to establish the jurisdiction of this Court and its limit is in ground (b). For it clearly appears from the above excerpts from the various reasons for judgment that there is no dissent as to ground (a) and what is alleged as ground (c) does not point to a dissent but to the manner in which the appeal should have been disposed of had the majority agreed with the minority that the substitution was not appropriate under ss. 2 of section 1016.\nSo, whether, on the issue, the different conclusions reached by the majority and the minority groups in the Court below rest on a point of difference on a question of law and, if so, the merit of such point of law, are the matters to be considered. For this purpose, what was said by the members of the Court below as to each of the three features conditioning the exercise of the special powers given to the Court of Appeal under ss. 2 of section 1016, may now be examined.\nThe first condition is that the appellant must have been convicted of an offence. The appellant contended that the existence of this condition is not established because the offence of which he was found guilty by the jury\u2014 criminal negligence\u2014was not, in the case at bar, an offence included in the indictment. Mr. Justice Barclay dealt with this point but left it as above indicated with no conclusion but simply the expression of a doubt. And if the sentence at the very end of his reasons: \"I consider there- fore that we have no right to substitute any other verdict\" cannot, because of inconsistency with the doubt expressed, be related to the point being considered, I should not hesitate to say that there is no dissent within the meaning of section 1023 and, consequently, no jurisdiction for this Court to deal with this point for dubitante is not tantamount to dissentiente. (The King v. Bailey et al 3).\nAssuming, however, that this conclusion with respect to the lack of right to substitute another verdict could be related to the point under discussion, and that our jurisdiction cannot otherwise be questioned, I must confess that I fail to see the difficulty. Again the first condition reads: \"Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence \u2026\" It does not read: \"Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence included in the indictment.\" To accept the appellant's suggestion would be tantamount to add a qualification to the first condition. It would equally curtail the field of the operation of the section to the limits of the authority assigned in section 951 to a jury to bring a verdict of guilty for a lesser offence. That ss. 2 of section 1016 includes a like power for a Court of Appeal is certain but it goes further for the second condition to its applicability does not read: \"And if the jury could, on the indictment, have found him guilty of a lesser offence,\" but reads: \"\u2026 of some other offence.\" In brief, the evident purpose of the section is to authorize the Court of Appeal to give effect to the finding of the jury or of the trial judge, if at all possible within the conditions prescribed. And such authority is consistent with the principle governing the disposal of appeals in criminal matters that, failing miscarriage of justice or substantial wrong, the appeal generally should be dismissed, even if it might, on the grounds raised, be decided in favour of the appellant.\nThe second condition to the right of substitution is that it must have been open to the jury on the indictment to find the appellant guilty of the offence proposed in substitution. The provisions of ss. 3 of section 951 were specifically enacted for the purpose of giving the authority to find \"reckless driving\" and this verdict, substituted by the Court of Appeal, is precisely the only one, the appellant contended, which could\u2014failing a verdict of manslaughter or an acquittal\u2014have been rendered on the indictment. As to the second condition, there is not even a discussion.\nThe third condition is that, on the actual finding, it must appear to the Court of Appeal that the jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved the appellant guilty of that other offence,\u2014in the premises, reckless driving. From their reasons for judgment, it is clear that the judges of the majority have exhaustively dealt with all the material available in the record to consider and answer the question implied in this condition. To that end, and to that end only\u2014for there was then no other issue legally before the Court\u2014they considered the verdict expressed by the jury, the facts revealed in the evidence put before the latter, and the address of the trial judge. They ultimately concluded that, on the actual finding of \"criminal negligence,\" not only was it clear to them that the jury were satisfied of facts which proved the appellant guilty of the offence of \"reckless driving,\" but that there was no other rational conclusion. In point of fact, they formed the opinion that, as expressed in the formal judgment, the jury ill expressed themselves.\nFor the minority judges, Barclay J. proceeded on quite a different basis with, naturally, quite a different result. He completely dismissed from his examination the facts proven. Dealing simply with the address of the trial judge and finding confusion as a result of some misdirections\u2014 which were not in issue as such but which he found\u2014he concluded:\nWith all these directions to the jury, I am of opinion that speculation as to what they really intended would be most unfair to the accused.\nAnd, at the end, he said:\nI consider that we have no right to substitute any verdict.\nIn substance, and as I read it, the dissent of the minority rests on the view that the Court of Appeal cannot, as a matter of law, substitute a verdict under section 1016 subsection 2 when speculation, needed to ascertain what the jury intended by their actual verdict, would, because of misdirections, be unfair to the appellant. In brief, what was really intended by the jury\u2014this was the issue and this cannot be a question of law alone\u2014was clear to the majority, while it was obscure to the minority the members of which, for the reason they indicated, refused to speculate.\nIt is thus manifest that with different elements in mind in the consideration of the question in issue,\u2014the members of the minority dismissing the evidence from the study of the question,\u2014the members of the Court naturally had a different view of the same and for reasons entirely unrelated, were led, in the result, to a different conclusion. And while the decision of the majority rests on a question of fact, i.e., the intent of the jury, the dissent of the minority rests on the question of law above stated. On this point of law expressed by the latter, the former never dissented either expressly or by implication. Nor did, upon the view they took, even the occasion to consider the point of law ever arise.\nThe appeal to this Court being taken under subsection 1 of section 1023, as enacted in 1925 c. 38 s. 27 in substitution to the relevant part of what was then section 1024, it is convenient to quote the material parts of the two sections and a few of the decisions of this Court rendered thereunder with respect to the limits of the jurisdiction of this Court in the matter.\nBefore 1925, section 1024 read:\nAny person convicted of any indictable offence whose conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section 1013, may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of such conviction: Provided that no such appeal can be taken if the Court of Appeal is unanimous in affirming the conviction \u2026\nIn Davis v. The King 4, Newcombe, J., delivering the judgment of the majority, said, at page 526, in reference to section 1024 above:\nThe interpretation of the latter section has frequently been considered by this Court and it is established by a long and practically uniform course of decision which has become firmly embedded in the practice of the Court that the only questions open to consideration upon appeals under that provision are the points of difference between the dissenting judge or judges and the majority of the Court of Appeal. Subsection 1 of section 1023, applicable to this case, reads:\nAny person convicted of any indictable offence whose conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section 1013, may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of such conviction on any question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.\nIt may be observed that the latter provision, clearer in this respect than the former, does not read \"any question of law in the dissent\" but reads \"any question of law-ore which there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.\"\nIn Manchuk v. The King 5, the appeal being taken upon subsection 1 of section 1023 above, Sir Lyman Duff, the then Chief Justice, delivering the judgment of the majority, said at page 346:\nThe appeal is, by law, necessarily limited to the grounds upon which the learned judges dissented.\nIn The King v. D\u00e9cary 6, the same learned jurist, again delivering the judgment for the Court, stated at page 82:\nIt is well settled by the decision of this Court that such grounds must raise the question of law in the strict sense and that it is not a competent ground of appeal if it raises only a mixed question of fact and law.\nAnd having proceeded to compare the reasons for judgment of the majority with those of the minority, in order to find the points of difference on law, Sir Lyman concluded with respect to the reasons of the former:\nIt is quite plain that the judgment does not rest upon any view of the majority upon a question which is a question of law alone.\nAnd with respect to the reasons of the latter:\nTurning now to the judgment of the minority, Mr. Justice Hall simply says: \"I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\" Plainly there is no dissent upon any question of law. Mr. Justice Walsh, in the reasons delivered by him for his conclusion that there should be a new trial, does not say either expressly or by implication, that this conclusion is based upon an opinion that the majority proceeds upon any error in point of law alone.\nBeing of opinion that the judgment of the majority in this case does not rest upon a question of law alone and that the judgment of the minority rests on a question of law upon which there was no expressed or implied dissent from the majority, I must conclude that it is not within the jurisdiction of this Court to review the answer given by the Court of Appeal to the question implied in the third condition of section 1016 subsection 2.\nFor the appellant, it was suggested, at first, that the point of law ultimately raised by the minority is that subsection 2 of section 1016 cannot apply to a case where, the verdict proposed in substitution to the actual verdict would, on the state of the record, have been bad in law, had it been found by the jury. And then, it was said that the minority effectively found misdirections which, in their views, could have vitiated the verdict of reckless driving, had it been rendered.\nWith respect to the first branch of this contention, I must say with deference, that I am unable to read this proposition of law as being either expressed or implied in the views of the minority. It is certainly not expressed and, even if and with the necessity of involved construction, it could be said to be implied, again I should not fail to observe that the members of the majority, because of the view they took, never considered nor had to consider this proposition for the conclusion they reached and, therefore, never dissented upon it.\nAs to the second branch of the contention, it must be assumed that, had this been the reasoning of the minority, they would not have failed\u2014as they did\u2014to deal with the facts of the case in order to consider whether or not, in the light of the principle of subsection 2 of section 1014, the result, notwithstanding these misdirections, would inevitably have been the same. And in the event of a doubt on this question, they would, in view of the evidence on the record, have ordered a new trial.\nI may finally add that, if an affirmative conclusion, as to the existence of such a dissent within the meaning judicially approved of section 1023 could have been reached, it would then have been necessary, in the consideration of the merit of the alleged point of law, to note that this Court in the Manchuk case 7 applied subsection 2 of section 1016 though clearly of the opinion that there were, in the address of the trial judge, misdirections amounting, in the result, to a mistrial.\nFor the above reasons, the appeal should be dismissed. The dissenting judgment of Locke and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) of the Province of Quebec 8 pronounced on the 12th of May, 1949, substituting for a verdict of \"guilty of Criminal Negligence\" a verdict of \"Dangerous driving of an automobile pursuant to section 285 of the Criminal Code\", affirming the sentence passed by the learned trial judge and dismissing the appeal. L\u00e9tourneau C.J. and Barclay J. dissenting would have allowed the appeal and directed the acquittal of the accused.\nThe appellant was tried before Cousineau J. and a jury on a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle. The jury brought in a verdict of guilty of criminal negligence. This verdict was entered and the appellant was sentenced to fifteen months imprisonment. An appeal was taken, the grounds of appeal being as follows:\n1. Le verdict de n\u00e9gligence criminelle \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gal vu l'acte d'accusation port\u00e9 contre l'appelant dans la pr\u00e9sente cause;\n2. Les commentaires ill\u00e9gaux du procureur de la Couronne dans son adresse aux jur\u00e9s sur le fait que l'accus\u00e9 n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 et le refus du pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal d'arr\u00eater les proc\u00e9dures et d'ordonner un nouveau proc\u00e8s, tel que demand\u00e9 par le procureur de l'appelant;\n3. Le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal a err\u00e9 dans sa charge aux jur\u00e9s en omettant de leur donner les directives requises par la loi dans le cas de preuve de circonstances.\nThe Court of Appeal held unanimously that the verdict of guilty of criminal negligence could not stand and the correctness of that holding was not questioned before us. It is, I think, clear that, as a matter of law, on an indictment for manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle only three verdicts are possible, (i) guilty of manslaughter, (ii) guilty of the offence created by section 285(6) of the Criminal Code (which by implication is a finding of not guilty on the charge of manslaughter); or (iii) not guilty. The majority of the Court of Appeal were of opinion that the proper course was to substitute a verdict of guilty of dangerous driving, pursuant to section 285(6), taking the view that this course was authorized by the provisions of section 1016(2) of the Code.\nFrom this judgment the appellant appeals to this court, the grounds of appeal being stated as follows:\nThe grounds of law on which the present appeal is based are those set forth in the dissenting judgment of the Honourable Messrs. Justices Barclay and L\u00e9tourneau of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side, for the Province of Quebec, which heard the case and in the formal judgment of the other judges and also those mentioned in the appeal, to wit:\nA) The verdict of criminal negligence was illegal in view of the indictment for manslaughter resulting from an automobile accident against the appellant in the present case;\nB) The Court of Appeal erred in substituting, as it did, a verdict of reckless driving to the verdict of criminal negligence rendered by the jury;\nC) The Court of Appeal, for the reasons mentioned in the foregoing grounds of appeal, should have quashed the conviction;\nI agree with the view of Barclay J. that the Court of Appeal had no right to substitute a verdict of guilty of dangerous driving.\nIt must, I think, be clear that the Court of Appeal can convict an accused of an indictable offence of which he has not been convicted by the court of first instance only if statutory authority can be found for such a course. It is suggested that such authority is conferred by section 1016(2).\nBefore section 1016(2) can be effective to confer this power upon the court in an appeal following a trial by jury there appear to be three conditions which must exist.\n(1) The appellant must have been convicted of an offence.\n(2) It must have been open to the jury on the indictment to have found him guilty of some other, offence.\n(3) It must appear to the Court of Appeal on the actual finding that the jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved the accused guilty of such other offence.\nIn the case at bar it is evident that the second condition set out above is satisfied. Dealing with the first condition mentioned above, Mr. Drapeau argues that the offence of which the appellant has been convicted must be an offence of which it was possible in law that he could be convicted on the indictment and that a conviction of an offence neither charged nor included in the indictment is a legal nullity and not a conviction at all. We were not referred to any case in which this argument appears to have been considered and I have not been able to find one. I have examined a number of cases decided either under section 1016(2) of the Criminal Code or under section 5(2) of the English Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, 7 Edward VII c. 23, which is in substantially the same words, but I have found only one in which it appeared that the verdict for which a different verdict was substituted was one which could not in law have been found on the indictment. The case to which I refer is The King v. Quinton 9 affirming 1947 O.R. 1. In that case the accused was tried on an indictment charging attempted rape. The jury returned a verdict of \"guilty of assault on a female causing actual bodily harm.\" The Court of Appeal for Ontario held unanimously, and it was apparently not disputed in this court, that the last mentioned offence is not included in a charge of attempted rape, the only other offences included in that charge being indecent assault and common assault. The Court of Appeal substituted a conviction for common assault and passed a lesser sentence. The Crown appealed to this court arguing that a conviction for indecent assault should have been substituted. The appeal was dismissed. There is nothing in the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal or of this court to indicate that the argument put forward in the case at bar by Mr. Drapeau was advanced or considered and the point appears to me to be still open for consideration in this court. I do not find it necessary to pass upon it in this appeal and I think it very doubtful whether it is open for our consideration in view of the manner in which the dissenting judgments are expressed.\nIn my view the third condition mentioned above is not fulfilled in the case at bar. It will be observed that it must appear to the Court of Appeal on the actual finding that the jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved the appellant guilty of a breach of section 285(6).\nIn determining whether on the actual finding the jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved the accused guilty of such offence no doubt the Court of Appeal would find it necessary to examine the evidence and the charge of the learned trial judge. If, in the course of such examination, it should appear that there was error in law in the charge, so grave that had the jury found a verdict of guilty of dangerous driving it must have been set aside on appeal, I think that section 1016(2) would not empower the Court of Appeal to enter such a verdict. The section must, I think, contemplate a situation where if the jury had found the verdict proposed to be substituted such verdict would on the state of the record have been good in law. To hold otherwise would bring about the startling result that the Court of Appeal could substitute for a verdict, which for some reason can not stand, another verdict which if the jury had found it must have been set aside.\nIn my view, for the reasons given by Barclay J., because of what was, I think, a fatal defect in the charge of the learned trial judge, a verdict of guilty under section 285(6) could not have stood even if the jury had made it. I think that in effect the learned trial judge charged the jury that they could, and indeed should, find the accused guilty if, in their view of the evidence, his conduct was such as to amount to what is commonly called civil negligence. I think that this was clearly wrong. The learned trial judge appears to have adopted a passage from one of the judgments delivered in McCarthy v. The King 10, without giving effect to the explanation of that judgment contained in The King v. Baker 11. In my view this is entirely a matter of law and this ground is I think stated in the dissenting judgment of Barclay J.\nIt is argued for the Respondent that this ground is not open for our consideration. It is said that it was not taken in the notice of appeal to the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) and is not a ground of dissent. It is true that the defect in the charge referred to above was not made a ground of appeal to the Court of Appeal but this seems to me, in this case, to be unimportant. The conviction from which the appeal was taken was bad in law as not being possible on the indictment. I do not think that the appellant was required to set out other grounds or to anticipate that the Court of Appeal would substitute a different verdict and to state reasons why that course should not be followed. The appeal to this court is expressly stated to be based on \"the grounds of law set forth in the dissenting judgment.\" While it may be proper that the notice of appeal should state with particularity what those grounds are said to be, it is in the reasons for judgment given by the dissenting judge rather than in the notice of appeal that our jurisdiction must be found. The only question as to which there was disagreement in the Court of Appeal was whether the verdict of guilty of criminal negligence having been annulled, the Court of Appeal could or should substitute another verdict. If and in so far as this decision turned on matters of fact or of mixed fact and law we have no jurisdiction to review it, but if and in so far as it turned on matters of law and if and in so far as such matters of law form part of the grounds of dissent, we have jurisdiction. I read the reasons of the minority as holding inter alia that section 1016(2) cannot be applied because there was such misdirection by the learned trial judge as to the kind of negligence which must be found to exist to warrant a verdict of guilty of dangerous driving under section 285(6) that as a matter of law a verdict of dangerous driving even if the jury had found it could not have stood.\nIt will be observed that at the commencement of his reasons Barclay J. says \"In the view which I take of this case, it is not necessary to consider the facts.\" After holding that the jury could not on the indictment legally find a verdict of criminal negligence, the learned judge goes on to discuss the question whether a verdict of dangerous driving should be substituted under section 1016(2). He quotes the fatal misdirection referred to above, adds other criticisms of the charge and continues: \"With all these directions to the jury, I am of the opinion that speculation as to what they really intended would be most unfair to the accused.\" He then expresses a doubt, but does not decide, as to whether section 1016(2) applies unless the verdict proposed to be substituted is included in the offence found by the jury; and concludes \"I consider therefore that we have no right to substitute any other verdict.\"\nI do not think it is a forced construction of the reasons of the learned judge to read them as indicating that one of the grounds which moved him to hold that the Court of Appeal had no right to substitute a verdict was the misdirection referred to above.\nIn The King v. D\u00e9cary 12, in quashing an appeal on the ground that there was no dissent on any question of law, the judgment of the court at page 84 reads as follows: \"Mr. Justice Walsh in the reasons delivered by him for his conclusion that there should be a new trial, does not say, either expressly or by implication, that this conclusion is based upon an opinion that the majority proceeds upon any error in point of law alone.\"\nIn my view, in the case at bar, Barclay J. does point out an error in law, the misdirection referred to above, and does, I think expressly but certainly if not expressly then by implication, base his judgment upon it, I think the point is properly before us.\nIt has been suggested that it is a condition of this Court's jurisdiction to entertain an appeal under section 1023(1) of the Criminal Code that the dissenting judgment upon which such appeal is based shall proceed upon a point of law with which the majority also deals and upon which the majority and the dissenting judge or judges are in disagreement. I am unable to accept this view. It is not, I think, disagreement between the judges of the Court of Appeal on a point of law which gives jurisdiction. If that were so there would be a right of appeal in a case in which one judge expressed definite disagreement on a point of law dealt with by the other members of the court but agreed with them that the appeal should be dismissed. In my opinion the existence of the following two conditions is sufficient to give this court jurisdiction: (i) that there be a dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal, that is a judgment differing from the result proposed by the majority and (ii) that a ground upon which such dissenting judgment is based be a question of law.\nI would allow the appeal and quash the conviction but under all the circumstances of the case I think that the proper course is not to direct a verdict of acquittal to be entered but to direct a new trial on the charge of a breach of section 285(6) of the Criminal Code.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Jean Drapeau.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Lucien Thinel.\n1 Q.R.

The trial judge found that the ship had been negligent and exonerated the operators of the bridge. The ship appealed to this Court against this finding of negligence and the Water District appealed against the exoneration of the Harbours Board.\nHeld: That the ship, in disregard of her duty to the Water District mains, committed a negligent act by approaching so close to the bridge without having seen the green signal, thus incurring the risk of having to anchor in the area occupied by the mains.\nHeld (Locke J. dissenting), that the operators of the bridge were also at fault, in neglecting to switch off the red light and switch on the green after the span had been raised; but (Rand and Locke JJ. contra) the easement provision in the agreement under which the mains were laid precluded the Water District from claiming against the Harbours Board for the damage.\nHeld (Locke J. expressing no opinion), that under the Admiralty Act (S. of C. 1934, c. 31) the Exchequer Court had jurisdiction to deal with the claim of the Water District against the Harbours Board. Per Locke J. (dissenting in part): The trial judge having heard the evidence of the two operators of the span his finding that the green light was displayed as sworn to by them should not be disturbed, and therefore the appeal of the respondent, Water District, should be dismissed as against the National Harbours Board. (Arpin v. The Queen 14 Can. S.C.R. 736, Granger v. Brydon-Jack 58 Can. S.C.R. 491, Powell v. Streatham [1935] A.C. 243 and Watt v. Thomas [1947] 1 A.E.R. 583 referred to).\nAPPEALS from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, British Columbia Admiralty District 1.\nAlfred Bull K.C. and D. S. Montgomery for the appellant.\nDouglas McK. Brown K.C. and John J. Urie for Greater Vancouver Water District.\nF. D. Smith K.C. and J. I. Bird for National Harbours Board.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau and Kellock JJ. was delivered by\nKellock J.:\u2014The ship appeals on the ground that there was no negligence on the part of anyone for whom it is chargeable, while the Water District appeals against the finding of the trial judge 2 in exoneration of the Harbours Board.\nAs to the ship, it is clear on the evidence that both the pilot and the captain were aware of the existence and location of the mains here in question, and that they were also aware of the position of the ship at all relevant times.\nThe ship had blown for the bridge when it was opposite Berry Point, one and one-half miles east of the bridge. Almost immediately thereafter, the red light on the bridge appeared. Both the pilot and the captain gave evidence that in their experience the invariable practice was for the red light to be followed \"shortly after\" by the green, indicating that the span was up. On the occasion in question, however, according to the evidence of those on the ship, the green light did not appear as formerly, and for that reason the whistle signal was repeated a number of times, the ship meanwhile proceeding slowly along the channel which was progressively becoming narrower and more dangerous for a ship of that size, should she have to anchor. The mains occupy, some 550 feet between a point 1,100 feet east and 1,650 feet east of the bridge.\nBoth the captain and the pilot say that the visibility was good. However, those in charge of the ship knew, or should have known, that if the green signal continued to be delayed in its appearance, the time would come when the ship could safely proceed no farther. In my view, it was negligent for the ship to proceed to the point it did before stopping or casting its anchor. In so proceeding, the ship was voluntarily incurring the risk of having to anchor in the area occupied by the mains. There was no necessity for such a course. She could and should have anchored to the east. I think the language of Willes J. in the Sub-Marine Telegraph Company v. Dickson 3, is applicable:\nIt is the duty of the persons navigating so to exercise their rights as to do no damage to the property of others \u2026 No one is justified in wilfully or by culpable negligence injuring property of another, whether above or under water.\nWith respect to the respondent, National Harbours Board, the learned trial judge accepted the evidence of the bridge operators to the effect that the span over the channel was raised immediately after the showing of the red light, but that fog existing at the upper level shrouded the light to such an extent that it was not visible to those navigating the ship. He also found that those on board the ship, including the pilot, were mistaken when they testified that they continued to see the red light until after the anchor had been dropped.\nThe learned trial judge did not base his finding as to the green light on credibility. On the contrary, his finding that the pilot was mistaken in testifying that he continued to see the red light until it was changed to green, was on the ground that he was honestly mistaken. The learned judge says that the pilot was undoubtedly a man of very great experience and that he gave his evidence in such a satisfactory and seamanlike fashion as to win his admiration. He said he felt that the witness was perfectly straightforward and that from his career he knew more about navigation under the Second Narrows Bridge than anybody else in the world.\nI think it must be taken that, so far as honesty is concerned, the learned trial judge had a similar view about the other witnesses on the ship who testified as to the lights on the bridge, as he puts his conclusion with regard to their evidence on the same basis as that of the pilot, namely, mistake. The reason he gives for accepting the evidence of the operators of the bridge as to the fog at the upper level of the bridge and as to the green light having replaced the red, is because he saw \"no ground why I should doubt the accuracy of the evidence of the bridge operators.\" In these circumstances, an appellate court is in as good a position as the trial judge to draw the proper inference from the evidence. As put by Viscount Simon in Watt v. Thomas 4:\nIt not infrequently happens that a preference for A's evidence over the contrasted evidence of B is due to inferences from other conclusions reached in the judge's mind rather than from an unfavourable view of B's veracity as such. In such cases it is legitimate for an appellate tribunal to examine the grounds of these other conclusions and the inferences drawn from them, if the materials admit of this, and, if the appellate tribunal is convinced that these inferences are erroneous and that the rejection of B's evidence was due to the error, it will be justified in taking a different view of the value of B's evidence.\nLord Thankerton said at p. 587:\nThe appellate court, either because the reasons given by the trial judge are not satisfactory, or because it unmistakably so appears from the evidence, may be satisfied that he has not taken proper advantage of his having seen and heard the witnesses, and the matter will then become at large for the appellate court.\nIn the case at bar, there is no controversy about the fact that the red light on the bridge was switched on at approximately 0414, and that it was seen by those on board the ship. This is expressly so found by the learned trial judge who says:\nAfter the \"Sparrows Point\" whistled, the bridge showed its red light so that the ship knew her signal had been heard.\nIt took approximately three minutes for the bridge span to be raised, and the entry in the bridge log indicates that the span was raised at 0417. The learned trial judge does not say when those on board the ship became mistaken, but on the evidence and his finding it is clear that they saw the red light for at least three minutes after it first appeared. Presumably, in the view of the learned trial judge, the mistake arose when the bridge with the light ascended into the fog which the bridge operators say existed at the upper level, but the learned judge does not indicate how the mistake could have arisen. There was no other red light with which that on the bridge could have been confused, and this is not suggested by the learned judge.\nCounsel for the Harbours Board very properly makes much of some evidence given by the Chief Officer of the ship to the effect that he saw the red light before the ship whistled initially. This evidence is so clearly erroneous that I do not think it is of any value one way or the other in the determination of the matters in issue. Clearly the red light did not go on except in answer to the ship's signal, and the witness's memory as to the time he first observed it is at fault.\nAccordingly, just how those on board the ship could have been mistaken and honestly mistaken in continuing to see the red light is left unexplained. The ship was continuously getting closer to the bridge and the view of those on board would continue to improve, and the mistake, if mistake there was, must have lasted for some ten minutes, from 0417 when the span went up, until 0427 after the ship had anchored. The trial judge finds that it was the sight of the green light which caused the ship to weigh anchor and proceed through the bridge even before the operators of the bridge say they saw the ship. In these circumstances and on these findings, I am unable to see any more ground for doubting the accuracy of the evidence of those on board the ship who testified to seeing the red light than for doubting the accuracy of the evidence of the bridge operators. In fact, acceptance of the evidence of the latter on the ground upon which it is put presents the tribunal of fact with the much greater difficulty of making some explanation as to how those on board the ship could have been mistaken in thinking that the red light, which they undoubtedly saw for the first three minutes after its appearance, continued within their vision, the forward movement of the ship continually narrowing the distance between them and the point where the light was situated.\nAlthough not of itself sufficient, it is of considerable significance in the light of the considerations mentioned above, that the conduct of the ship is entirely consistent with the evidence of those on board. When the green light did not appear within the customary period, the ship continued to blow its whistle to indicate that fact to the bridge operators, and the ship continued to approach the bridge, a fact which would be patent to them. As to the evidence of the bridge operators, that they advised the ship over the loud-speaker that the span had been raised, the witnesses on board the ship, honest witnesses according to the learned trial judge, say that they heard all that was said except the statement that the span had been raised. No motive is alleged or can be imagined why the ship would not have proceeded through the bridge if it had been apprised of the fact that the way was clear. No one suggests that there was any fog between the piers where the ship had to pass, nor anywhere except at the upper level, some 120 feet above the water. The bridge operators themselves admit that if those on board the ship could hear the loud-speaker at all, they could hear everything that was said, and it is significant that two independent witnesses who lived on the south bank of the channel, one 400 yards and the other 500 yards east of the bridge, heard what those on board the ship heard, and nothing else.\nIn these circumstances, I think there is more ground for doubting the accuracy of the evidence of the bridge operators than that of those on board the ship. I think the conclusion must be that the mistake was on the part of the bridge operators in neglecting to switch off the red light and switch on the green after the span was raised, and that this omission was realized by them only when they realized that the ship was not going through but was anchoring. In my opinion, there was a duty on the Board not to do or omit to do anything which might unnecessarily result in damage to the water mains. In the present instance, I think there was a breach of that duty. The question was raised during the argument as to the jurisdiction of the Admiralty Court to deal with the claim of the Water District against the Harbours Board. It is clear, I think, that the court has no jurisdiction beyond that conferred by the statute; c. 31 of the statutes of 1934; Bow McLachlan and Co. v. The Ship \"Camosun\" 5. The statute has been changed since that decision, but the principle is still applicable. The answer to the question raised depends upon the meaning of the words \"damage by any ship\" in s. 22(1) (iv) of Schedule A to the statute of 1934, which reproduces s. 22 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Consolidation Act (1925) c. 49, the language of which is \"any claim for damage done by a ship.\" There have been a number of decisions since the enactment of the original statute of 1861, 24 Vic. c. 10, s. 7.\nIn the \"Uhla\" 6, and in the \"Excelsior\" 7, jurisdiction was exercised in the case of damage done by a ship to a dock, and in Mayor of Colchester v. Brooke 8, jurisdiction was exercised in the case of damage to oyster beds.\nIn the case of the \"Bien\" 9, the plaintiff, lessee of an oyster bed, sued the conservators of the River Medway and the owner of a ship for damage sustained to an oyster bed caused by a ship when acting under orders of a harbour master. That case was, of course, decided after the Judicature Acts when the jurisdiction of the Admiralty Division was no longer limited to that formerly exercised by the Court of Admiralty. The circumstances in question in the present proceedings are analogous. If the claim against the Harbours Board cannot be entertained in the Admiralty Court, the result is that the Water District ought to have brought two actions, the one on the Admiralty side of the Exchequer Court against the ship, and the other elsewhere.\nIn my opinion, the statute, which prima facie confers jurisdiction upon the Admiralty Court in a case of this kind, should be construed so as to affirm the jurisdiction, at least in a case where the ship is a party. There is no authority to the contrary to which we have been referred or which I have been able to find, and every consideration of convenience requires a construction in favour of the existence of such a jurisdiction.\nIn the \"Zeta\" 10, Lord Herschell, in referring to s. 7 of the Act of 1861, said at p. 478:\nIt is enough to say that the proposition that the Act of 1861 applies to damage done by a ship to persons and things other than ships has been well established by many authorities, the correctness of which I see no reason to question.\nWith respect to the earlier Act of 1840 (damage to a ship), he said at p. 485:\nEven if its operation, when the words are construed according to their natural meaning, be to enlarge the jurisdiction of the Court of Admiralty in the case of damage received by a ship upon the high seas, there is nothing in the frame of the enactment to indicate that this was not the intention of the Legislature, though, no doubt, its chief object may have been to extend the jurisdiction which existed in the case of damage received by ships upon the high seas to damage received in the body of a county. It does not provide in terms for an extension, to cases where the occurrence is within the body of the county, of the jurisdiction which would exist if the occurrence had been upon the high seas; but it gives jurisdiction in certain cases 'whether the ship may have been within the body of a county or upon the high seas'.\nIt is true that it has been held that s. 7 of the original Act does not extend to permit a pilot to be sued in the Admiralty Court, but these decisions stem from the judgment of Dr. Lushington in the \"Urania\" 11, in which no reasons were given for such a construction. In the later case of the \"Alexandria\" 12, Sir Robert Philimore, while deeming himself bound by the earlier decision, said that had the question been res integra, he would have considered an action against a pilot as within the statute. These decisions were followed by the Court of Appeal in The Queen v. The Judge of the City of London Court 13. This decision was in turn approved by Lord Macnaghten in the \"Zeta\" 14, but the majority of their Lordships in that case expressed no opinion on the point, Lord Herschell stating at p. 486 that\nIn that and the other cases relating to suits instituted in respect of the negligence of pilots, stress was laid oh certain considerations which do not touch the case with which your Lordships have to deal.\nThe considerations referred to, as stated by the Master of the Rolls (4) in (1892) 1 Q.B. at p. 298, are that a pilot, sued in Admiralty in respect of a collision which has occurred through his negligence, would be deprived of the common law defence of contributory negligence, and that originally the pilot's liability in the Admiralty Court was unlimited although the owners of the ship would have had a limited liability only.\nIn such a case as the present, these considerations do not apply. As to the effect of a finding of contributory negligence, it was pointed out by Lord Herschell L.C. in the \"Zeta\" that the rule as to division of damages in Admiralty applied only in the case of collisions between ships. In the present case, if the Harbours Board were sued in the ordinary courts, it would seem that contributory negligence of the plaintiff would be a defence. Under its statute, 1 Ed. VIII c. 42, s. 3(2), the Board is a corporation, and for all purposes of the Act, the agent of His Majesty. By subsection (3) it is given capacity to contract and to sue and be sued in its own name. By s. 10, all property acquired or held by the Board shall be vested in His Majesty. I think, in the presence of these provisions, the existence of a cause of action in tort is to be governed by the same principles as apply in the case of a claim in tort against the Crown. A bridge vested in the Crown and operated by an agent of the Crown is a \"public work\" within the meaning of s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act and as a cause of action for negligence of a servant of the Crown on a public work is and was liable to be defeated on the ground of contributory negligence, long before the passing in 1925 of the British Columbia Contributory Negligence Act, the result would be the same in the provincial courts in such a case as the present. The other consideration as to the limits of liability of a pilot has no application.\nOn the other hand, all claims arising out of the damage occasioned by the ship should be disposed of in one action so as to avoid the scandal of possible different results if more than one action were tried separately. I therefore think that the statute is to be construed as clothing the Exchequer Court on its Admiralty side with the necessary jurisdiction. In my opinion, however, the claim of the Water District with respect to the damage to all the mains other than No. 6 is excluded by the provisions of P.C. 319:\n1. The Corporation agrees to assume all responsibility for the laying, construction and maintenance of the water mains or for any damage which may be done to the water mains by vessels fouling them, or for any damage which may be done by the said water mains to vessels, provided that nothing herein shall deprive the Corporation of any legal recourse it may have against any person or persons damaging the said water mains wilfully or through negligence.\n2. It is distinctly understood and agreed that nothing herein contained shall operate to render His Majesty or his officers, servants or workmen liable directly or indirectly for damage which may be done from any cause to the said water mains.\nIn the first place, it is to be pointed out that the Crown is the owner of the bed of the harbour, and that, by the order-in-council the right to lay and maintain the mains was granted to the predecessor in title of the Water District. Accordingly, the latter could suffer damage to the mains by trespass, whether wilful or not, as well as by negligence; the \"Swift\" 15. It is plain from the provisions of paragraph 1 above, that damage from all three causes was in the contemplation of the draftsmen. Under that paragraph, taken by itself, the grantee is to assume all responsibility for damage to the mains \"by vessels fouling them,\" but by force of the proviso, recourse against \"any\" person or persons is preserved or provided for in the case of wilful or negligent damage. Any person or persons would include servants of the Crown.\nI think the intention of paragraph 2 is to provide that negligence of Crown servants is not to be taken as excepted out of the broad language of paragraph 1 by reason of anything in the proviso. Put another way, the proviso does operate to render Crown servants liable, as it excepts them from the broad exemption granted by the earlier language of the paragraph. To read paragraph 2 otherwise in relation to damage to the mains \"by vessels fouling them\" would, in my opinion, render the paragraph nugatory. I do not think it should be so read, and giving it the operation which I think should be given, the effect is to preclude the Water District from claiming against the Crown in respect of the damage to any of the mains other than No. 6. This main was laid prior to the license granted by P.C. 319, and is not affected by it. It is not shown under what authority this main was laid, but that it was rightfully there is recognized by the order-in-council itself, as it is shown on the plan attached thereto. The easement agreement, to which reference is made, does not apply to this main.\nI think, therefore, that the Water District is entitled to recover against the Harbours Board in respect of the damage to main No. 6, and to that extent its appeal should be allowed against the Board with costs throughout. The appeal of the ship should be dismissed with costs.\nRand J.:\u2014The determinative question in the facts of this controversy is whether or not the red light on the bridge was seen by those on board the vessel, as they assert, up to the time of anchoring.\nThere is no dispute that the sole purpose of the vessel was to pass through the bridge in safety and with the least delay; that the signal for the draw had been given at 4:14 a.m. at 1\u00bd miles from the bridge and had been at once answered by the red light; and that the vessel was then seen by those on the bridge and the bridge light from the vessel: the conflict begins as from the hour 4:17. The bridge tender asserts that at that moment the draw had been raised to a height of 120 feet, the red light switched off and the green on; while from the vessel it is insisted that the red light continued until about a minute after the anchor dropped. That action was a serious step and was taken only in what was considered to be an emergency; and there can be no doubt that the pilot and ship's officers did not, up to that time, see the green light.\nThen followed these significant occurrences: within approximately a minute of anchoring, the noise of which was clearly heard on the drawbridge, the green light appeared, the anchor was at once raised, and the vessel proceeded to pass through the draw without further incident. She was said not to have been seen from the bridge at anchor, and to have been first observed about 1,000 feet from the bridge, approximately 500 feet west from the anchorage, as emerging from fog. The explanation of the one light being seen and the other not may be that the light on the bridge is more powerful than that on the vessel.\nOf those on board whose testimony is to be considered, there was, first, the pilot. This man, MacKay, is one of the senior pilots of Vancouver, who was said by Smith J. 16 to know the harbour and its navigation probably better than anyone else. His veracity is unquestioned; but the trial judge, accepting the statements of the men operating the draw, finds that the pilot must have been mistaken in thinking he saw the red light, either it seems to be, as to its colour or its identity. On the ship's bridge with the pilot were the captain, the third officer and the quartermaster: all gave evidence to the same effect as the pilot. The first officer was stationed on the fo'c's'le and although his primary duty was in relation to the anchor, he likewise saw the red light up to the moment of anchoring. His statement that he saw it before the first signal of approach, admittedly erroneous, was probably an inadvertence.\nIn this conflict, I reconstruct the situation as follows: the signal for the draw was made at 4:14, it was at once answered by the red light, which was seen by the vessel, and the draw raised as claimed; the tender overlooked changing from the red to the green signal, a double operation carried out by separate switches; this condition continued until he and his assistant were startled to hear the anchor chain running out, an occurrence unusual so near the bridge and one which would arouse them to a realization that something was wrong; checking their own operations, they discovered the red light still burning and swiftly made the change seen by those on the vessel. It may be, as they say, that there was some fog or mist conceivably generated at the higher level by the air of the cabin and that they had lost sight of the ship; that may explain the use of the megaphone, for otherwise its use would appear purposeless. They may have thought, also, that the fog or mist extended to the water, which it did not; but it was not any clearing of fog that brought about the vessel's movement from anchorage. The unchallenged matters exclude, I think, the possibility that the officers of the vessel, including the pilot, bent on their navigation, could have been mistaken in the continued perception of the red light, after first seeing it appear at the moment when admittedly it did appear; if the trial judge means, mistaken as to having seen it at all, a fortiori, I would be forced to disagree with him: the fact that the ship's light was seen from the drawbridge would seem to me to be conclusive against such a view. The suggestion that it might have been a light either on the north or south shore beyond the bridge was only faintly pressed, and is ruled out by the evidence of the pilot: certain lights on what was called the Navy Dock along the north shore had in fact been seen by him, and those on the south shore would be outside his line of vision. What seems to me to be the overwhelming probability is that the controlling circumstance was not a mistake in vision by the pilot, but the oversight of the persons on the bridge to switch from red to green.\nOn that view of the navigating facts, what is the responsibility of either or both of the defendants for the damage done? The ship must be charged with knowledge that the pipes were rightfully on the harbour bed; and the Water District was not negligent in exercising the license by failing to place them in trenches. The mode adopted is not in itself unreasonable; it is indicated on the plans approved by the orders made; and, for about forty years that condition of some of them has been known by all concerned. The notation on the navigation chart used by the vessel is a warning of their presence of which the pilot and captain were aware: and the Commission had full knowledge of the installations.\nBy the regulations of the Commission relating to signals, the green light is necessary before the bridge can be approached beyond \"a safe distance,\" and until that signal is seen a vessel proceeds in contemplation not only of risks to the bridge and navigation generally but also to property which the incidents of navigation may give rise to. The dangers inherent in an uncertain right of navigating the narrow channel approaching the bridge should have been apparent; and to allow the vessel to hazard them on the chance that passage would be cleared before emergency measures should become necessary was a disregard of the duty owing to the Water District.\nOn the other hand, the movement of the vessel was under the actual control not only of the pilot and the ship's officers, but also of the bridge tender. The recognition signal of the approach and the continued absence of a stand-off warning left it to the vessel to proceed cautiously while the draw was being made ready. The single red light represented normal conditions to prevail, that the machinery was in order, and that the vessel had the right of way over any other through the draw. It was, for some considerable time, wholly reasonable for the pilot to expect momentarily that the green signal would appear, for which the contention that it was shown at 4:17 is the strongest justification. The megaphone was used in fact to aid the vessel in moving through what was thought to be fog; but in conjunction with the single red light and the absence of the double red lights, it added to the confusion and led to dropping the anchor. Anticipating the green light, anxious to avoid an unnecessary delay in anchoring, being warranted in his expectation and approaching the indefinite point of a safe distance, how can it be said that what he did was so gross or reckless as no prudent pilot could have been led into and as outside and beyond any reasonable or probable consequence of negligence in the drawbridge signalling? The bridge tenders must, in such circumstances, contemplate that their neglect in giving the green signal may draw a vessel too far down the harbour and into hazardous waters, and that is what happened. The actual navigation was thus the product of the joint negligence of the persons operating the signals on the drawbridge and of those in charge of the vessel: Brown v. B. & F. Theatres 17.\nIn its statutory assumption of the direction of navigation through the drawbridge, the Commission has undertaken to operate the signals with the customary care and skill where interests are committed to reliance on the discharge of this sort of duty by others. Since it had full knowledge of the existence and the placement of the pipes, that responsibility would extend to foreseeing that negligence in signalling might in the ordinary course of things bring about emergency action in the channel by which property of various kinds might be affected. There was, thus, a direct obligation on the Commission toward the Water District to avoid bringing that situation about negligently: The \"Mystery\" 18.\nFor the first time in the proceedings, the objection is taken, on behalf of the Harbour Commission, that the Admiralty jurisdiction of the Court does not permit the joinder of the Commission, and it calls for some consideration. It is based on the fact that the claim is for damage to property on land within the body of a county and is by and against a person other than the owner of a ship. In The Queen v. Judge of City of London Court 19, it was held by the Court of Appeal that the Admiralty Court had no jurisdiction to entertain an action in personam against a pilot in respect of a collision on the high seas caused by his negligence. That decision limited the causes in personam that could be brought under the statutory jurisdiction which included damage done \"by a ship\". It followed the ruling of Sir Robert Phillimore in The \"Alexandria\" 20, which, likewise, was a proceeding against a pilot for damage done through his negligence on the Mersey. In the course of his reasons, however, Sir Robert stated that if the question had been res integra, he should have been of opinion that under the provisions of sections 7 and 35 of 24 Vic. c. 10, the Court had jurisdiction. Section 7 imports causes for damage done \"by a ship\" and 35 provides for actions in personam as well as in rem. On the other hand, in The \"Zeta\" 21, the House of Lords seems to have expressed the view that a ship is entitled to bring action in Admiralty against a Dock Authority for damage done \"to a ship\" through collision with a pier caused by the negligence of the Authority; and in The \"Swift\" 22, the owners of oyster beds were upheld in an action against a ship for damage done their property by negligent grounding. Whether a distinction between the jurisdiction in cases of damage \"by a ship\" and \"to a ship\" can be drawn from the statute remains, apparently, undecided.\nAs the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court for this purpose is the Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court in England, if the action had been brought against the Harbour Commission as for an individual tort, the point taken might be formidable; but the cause of action alleged is, strictly, one against joint tort feasors: The \"Koursk\" 23; i.e. both the vessel and the Commission have concerted in directing and controlling the movement of the vessel down the harbour: it was a single act with joint participants. In such a case, a judgment against one merges the cause of action and would be an answer to an action brought against the other in another court.\nThe Water Authority is entitled to assert a remedy in Admiralty both against the vessel, in rem, and against the ship owners, in personam; and the law administered would be Admiralty law. The limitation of the scope of proceedings so as to deny the joinder of the Harbour Commission would deprive the Authority of one of those remedies if it desired also to pursue its claim against the Commission. Every consideration of convenience and justice would seem to require that such a single cause of action be dealt with under a single field of law and in a single proceeding in which the claimant may prosecute all remedies to which he is entitled; any other course would defeat, so far, the purpose of the statute. The claim is for damage done \"by a ship\"; the remedies in personam are against persons responsible for the act of the ship; and I interpret the language of the statute to permit a joinder in an action properly brought against one party of other participants in the joint wrong.\nIt seems to have been assumed by counsel that the provincial Contributory Negligence Act applied as between the respondents, but I am unable to agree that it does. There is here a special situation. By the National Harbours Act the Commission is declared for all purposes of its administration of this harbour to be the agent of the Crown. Although that Act creates a duty on the Commission, by its commitment, in such a case, to the Admiralty Court, the law of that Court becomes applicable; and from the judgment of the House of Lords in The \"Devonshire\" 24 the maritime law, in this respect, is seen to be the same as the common law. It follows that there can be no contribution between the defendants.\nIt is contended finally by the Commission that the Water District is unable to assert such a claim by reason of an undertaking contained in the licence under which the pipes were laid. It was given by the City of Vancouver, and is recited in Order-in-Council P.C. 319 of 1926 as follows:\nIt is distinctly understood and agreed that nothing herein contained shall operate to render His Majesty or his officers, servants or workmen liable directly or indirectly for damage which may be done from any cause to the said water mains.\nWhat is \"herein contained\" is a licence to install the pipes on the harbour bed; what is excluded is the existence of any duty arising from the status of licensor. How that relation in any way tends or operates to render the Commission, representing His Majesty, liable for the damage caused by negligence in the operation of the drawbridge I am quite unable to see. The language is not at all apt to meet the case before us. If it had been intended that under no circumstances connected with the administration of the harbour should His Majesty be liable directly or indirectly for damage to the water mains, it would have been easy to provide so. But whatever was in the mind of the draftsman, the language he has used makes it impossible to extend it to the facts here.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal of \"Sparrow's Point\" with costs to the Water District and allow the appeal of the Water District with costs against the Harbour Commission in both Courts.\nLocke J. (dissenting in part):\u2014The occurrences which gave rise to the present proceedings are sufficiently stated in the judgment 25 from which this appeal is taken. At the outset the appellant ship is faced with the finding of fact by the learned trial judge that upon hearing the signal of the vessel at 4.14 a.m. when she was off Berry's Point, the operators of the bridge turned on one red light, the required signal to indicate that the whistle of the vessel had been heard, proceeded to raise the span to the height of 120 ft. and then extinguished the red light and turned on the green light to indicate to the approaching vessel that the span was open, and that it was due to the superstructure of the span being obscured from the vessel's view by fog or overcast that the signal was not visible from the vessel. The appellant, Greater Vancouver Water District, which had succeeded against the ship at the hearing but failed against the Harbours Board, while not in the first instance appealing against that portion of the judgment later obtained leave to appeal, is faced with the same difficulty. Unless this finding of fact is to be reversed in this Court, it appears to me to be decisive against both of the appellants.\nThe evidence of Clohosey, an employee of the defendant Harbours Board and the operator in charge of the bridge on the night in question, and of Robert Brassell, his assistant, is to the effect that the signal lights were examined by them when they came on duty about midnight of December 25 and found to be in order: that they had received a telephone message about 3 o'clock on the following morning informing them that the Sparrows Point was coming out on the tide and so were on the lookout for her and that when they heard three blasts of her whistle, the regular signal of an approaching vessel requiring the span to be opened, the single red light was turned on and the traffic gates of the bridge lowered, the span was at once raised to its full height of 120 feet and the red light then extinguished and the green light, which would indicate to the vessel that the span was raised, turned on and remained on until the time when the ship, after dropping her anchor and causing the damage complained of, passed through the bridge. Both say that when the ship's whistle was first given the visibility was fair but that when the span was raised, carrying with it the machinery house in which they carried on their operations, they found themselves in a dense fog. Being then unable to see the approaching vessel and apparently assuming that the green light situate near the upper part of the span would not be visible to the vessel, they attempted by using a loud speaker to give information to the ship that the span was open. According to the pilot, the master and other ship's officers, however, the green light was not seen until after the anchor had been dropped, their inability to discern it being caused, if the story of Clohosey and Brassell be true, by the fog at the upper level. The bridge operator was required by his instructions to keep a record of occurrences on the bridge, which Clohosey referred to as a log, and the original of this document in his handwriting shows the ship's signal heard at 4.14 a.m. and the span raised at 4.17 a.m., entries which he said he made at the time of these occurrences. In Clohosey's report of the accident to his employer, written in pencil on a form apparently provided for such occurrences, which was put in evidence by the appellant ship with its de bene esse evidence, the following appears:\nAt 04.14 I received a signal for the span to raise. I went outside and saw a ship in the distance coming from east. I answered signal at once and began to operate bridge. When bridge was open or raised I gave signal green light at 04.17 but could not see ship as fog has come down. The ship began signalling for the span to open. I began using the loud speaker and did not see ship until she was about the pipe line. I heard her dropping anchor and assistant who was listening heard some one say \"there is the bridge.\" Passed through at 04.35 and changed course to port about 4 when signalled down to almost zero and about 2 when vessel passed bridge.\nAt the time the Sparrows Point signalled for the span the visibility was about 4. Could see ship. At the time the span was raised I could not see ship. Fog set in between 04.14 04.17. Vis. bad or about 100 yards. About 2 minutes before she came through around 04.33. I was talking on loud speaker before anchor dropped. Vessel continued to signal for bridge after signal span open given. I saw the vessel when on this side of pipe line no one spoke from the vessel.\nIn the appropriate places on the form under the heading \"Weather\" there appears the words \"foggy, spotty\" and under the heading \"Visibility\" \"poor, Fog, about 4 when signalled down to almost zero and about 2 when vessel passed bridge.\"\nThis evidence was flatly contradicted by that of a number of witnesses including the pilot. According to the latter, the vessel left the British American Oil dock in Burrard Inlet at 3.02 a.m. intending to proceed through the second Narrows Bridge to Coal Harbour. When they reached a position opposite Roche's Point they ran unexpectedly into a bank of fog, whereupon they took the way off the ship and stopped: after a few minutes the fog bank clearing they proceeded towards Berry's Point and shortly after 4 o'clock, when opposite that place, blew three long blasts of the whistle for the bridge. This witness said that the red light then appeared and continued plainly visible until the ship reached a point something more than 400 yards to the east of the span when, the green light not being shown in spite of their having given repeated blasts from the whistle, it was necessary for the safety of the ship to drop the anchor. This evidence was supported by that of McElroy, the quartermaster of the vessel who was at the wheel, and by Captain Nilsen who was on the bridge, Ralph Kuhn, chief officer who was on the foc'scle head, together with the boatswain and two lookout men and by Arthur Costan, the third mate who was also upon the bridge. Of these witnesses, Nilsen, Kuhn and Costan gave their evidence de bene esse: McElroy, as well as the pilot, appeared at the trial. The boatswain and the two lookout men who had been in the foc'scle with Kuhn were not called. In addition to these witnesses who had been on the ship, evidence was given by some residents living on the south shore of the inlet shortly to the east of the bridge and by others who lived on the north side, who said that the visibility towards the bridge at or about the time of these occurrences was good: some of them had heard a voice speaking through the loud speaker but they were definite that it did not say that the bridge or the span was open, and several of the witnesses from the ship gave evidence as to this to the like effect.\nThe learned trial judge, however, believed Clohosey and Brassell. In his reasons delivered at the conclusion of the trial he said that he could see no ground for doubting the accuracy of their evidence and accepted it, that the atmospheric conditions that night were peculiar, there being fog banks lying around, and that, in his opinion, at a higher level at the bridge at the relevant time the fog was denser and heavier than elsewhere. As to the pilot whose honesty he clearly accepted and whom he described as a man of very great experience, he said that his evidence had been given in such a, satisfactory and seamanlike fashion as to win his admiration, but that he thought he was mistaken in thinking that he saw the red light up to and as late as the moment when he ordered that the anchor be dropped. In further reasons delivered at a later date he again stated that he accepted the evidence of the bridge officers \"who in the course of their duties noted in their log book what occurred\" and found that three minutes after hearing the ship's signal they had raised the span to its full elevation of 120 feet, the red light had been succeeded by the green light and all was in order for the ship to pass through, but that the dense fog on the upper level had prevented those on the ship from seeing the green light and that there was no fault on the part of the operators. As to the other witnesses from the ship who had testified that they continued to see the red light until the anchor was dropped, he said that he was satisfied that they were mistaken and that since both the red and green lights rose with the span into the fog above they could see neither.\nWhile the witnesses who were on the ship may have been mistaken in thinking that they had seen a red light continuously from the time they passed Berry's Point until the time of anchoring, conceivably confusing other lights visible in the harbour with that of the bridge, there can be no mistake on the part of Clohosey and Brassell as to the principal matters sworn to by them: these were either true or false and if false the entries in the log and the accident report concoctions of Clohosey. If their stories were untrue, there can be no doubt they were deliberately so. The log, so-called, maintained on the bridge bears as its first entry on December 26, 1946, the information as to the time of the raising of the span for the Sparrows Point, an entry which is signed by Clohosey in the appropriate place and this is followed by entries made by other employees engaged on the bridge recording other occurrences later on the same day and bears on its face nothing to indicate that it is not what it purports to be, a record made at the time. It is also the undoubted fact, as shown by the evidence of the witnesses for the ship, that there had been patches of fog in the harbour that morning: the Sparrows Point had itself been halted by such a fog near Roche's Point and when she passed through the bridge at 4.35 a.m. she again encountered fog in the anchorage to the west of the bridge, and that there was fog at the upper level to which the span was raised has been accepted as a fact by the learned trial judge. In Arpin v. The Queen 26, this Court said that where a judgment appealed from is founded wholly upon questions of fact it would not reverse it unless convinced beyond all reasonable doubt that it was clearly erroneous. The judgment of Taschereau J. in North British and Mercantile Insurance Company v. Tourville 27, where concurrent findings of fact were reversed, made it clear that it was not intended to depart from the rule as thus stated. In Granger v. Brydon-Jack 28, Anglin J. adopting the statement of Viscount Haldane in Nocton v. Ashburton 29, said that it was, in his opinion, a rash proceeding on the part of a court of appeal to reverse a judgment on an issue of pure fact, the finding of a trial judge necessarily and expressly made to depend upon the credit to be given to the conflicting evidence of the parties to the transaction whom he saw and heard testify. In Hontestroom v. Sagaporack 30, Lord Sumner said in part that not to have seen the witnesses puts appellate judges in a permanent position of disadvantage as against the trial judge and unless it could be shown that he had failed to use or had palpably misused his advantage the higher court ought not to take the responsibility of reversing conclusions so arrived at, merely on the result of their own comparisons and criticisms of the witnesses and of their own views of the probabilities of the case. In Powell v. Streatham 31, Lord Wright in referring to what had been said by Lord Sumner and noting that it was in an Admiralty appeal said (p. 265) that, in his opinion, the same principles applied in ordinary common law cases and that two principles were beyond controversy: first, that in an appeal from the decision of a trial judge based on his opinion of the trustworthiness of witnesses whom he has seen the court must, in order to reverse it, not merely entertain doubts whether the decision below was right but be convinced that it was wrong and that the court of appeal had no right to ignore what facts the judge had found on his impression of the credibility of the wit- nesses and proceed to try the case on paper on its own view of the probabilities as if there had been no oral hearing. The subject has been discussed at further length by Lord Greene, M.R. in Yuill v. Yuill 32, and by Viscount Simon in Watt v. Thomas 33.\nI think the present case was one where to see the witnesses Clohosey and Brassell and their demeanour as they gave evidence was of the utmost importance in determining whether they were telling the truth. Both men were aware that their statements had been flatly contradicted by the witnesses whose evidence had been taker. de bene esse and by the pilot and others, and were cross-examined at length by able and experienced counsel. The learned trial judge has had the advantage which I have not of seeing these men and closely observing their bearing in the box and has come to the conclusion that their evidence is the truth. I can see no justification for interfering with that finding.\nI respectfully agree with the further conclusion of the trial judge that for the ship to approach under the existing circumstances to a distance of not more than 400 or 500 yards from the bridge without having seen the green signal, thus placing herself in a position of jeopardy where it was apparently necessary for her own safety to drop the anchor, was a negligent act. The location of the water mains in the bed of the harbour at the place in question is clearly shown on the marine maps and their presence and approximate location were known both to the pilot and the master. Had those in charge of the ship, when they could not see the green light, stood off at a distance of 600 yards or more to the east of the bridge, anchoring if necessary, no damage could have resulted. It was the duty of the ship in these circumstances to refrain from damaging the mains by a negligent act (Sub-Marine Telegraph Company v. Dickson 33, per Willes J. at 779). Other considerations would, in my opinion, apply if, by way of illustration, a storm arose suddenly making it necessary in the ordinary course of navigation to drop the anchor to prevent the destruction of the ship, or if such a step were rendered necessary by some other force majeure not attributable to a voluntary act of those in charge of the vessel. Here, however, it was a direct result of what appears to me to be the failure of those in charge to exercise reasonable care in the circumstances which led them to drop the anchor and damage the property of the Water District. I am further of the opinion that a claim founded upon negligence is not affected either by the terms of the undertaking entered into by the predecessor in interest of the Water District or of the Orders-in-Council which authorized the works.\nThe appeal of the appellant ship should be dismissed and since, in my opinion, the finding of fact at the trial that the green light was shown under the circumstances stated by Clohosey and Brassell should not be disturbed, I would dismiss the appeal of the Water District. The respondents should have their costs of the appeal by the appellant ship and the respondent Harbours Board its costs as against the respondent Water District of the appeal of the latter from the judgment at the trial.\nAppeal of the ship dismissed with costs; and appeal of Water District allowed in part with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D.

On Jun. 9, the Court ordered a rehearing which took place on Oct. 16, 17 and 19. Judgment was delivered on Feb. 6, 1951.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA APPELLATE DIVISION\nCrown (Dom.) grant\u2014In fee simple of surface rights including petroleum and natural gas\u2014Reservation of royalty \"from time to time prescribed\"\u2014No royalty existing at time of grant\u2014Interest of Crown transferred to Alberta by statute\u2014Whether province can impose royalty\u2014Rent service\u2014Condition subsequent.\nIn 1913, by a grant authorized by Order in Council, respondent's predecessor in title acquired from His Majesty in the right of Canada, the surface rights to certain lands in Alberta including the petroleum and natural gas rights. The habendum clause of the patent read: \"\u2026 to have and to hold the same unto the grantee in fee simple\" while the reddendum provided for the payment of \"such royalty upon the said petroleum and natural gas, if any, from time to time prescribed by regulations \u2026\" At the time of the grant there was no specific royalty existing. In 1930, by the Alberta Natural Resources Act , 1930, c. 3 (Can.), transfer of the then remaining lands and interests, including royalties, of the Dominion was made to the province.\nHeld: the Chief Justice, Kerwin and Fauteux JJ. dissenting, that the reddendum is ineffective as a basis for subjecting the petroleum and natural gas taken from the said lands to a royalty imposed subsequent to the patent and is void as being a rent service lacking in certainty. Neither can a provision, void as a reservation, constitute a valid condition subsequent.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division 1, affirming, on an equal division of opinion, the decision of the trial judge granting respondent a declaration that the Government of Alberta had no right to impose any royalty with respect to the petroleum and natural gas found under his lands.\nG.

Field K.C. for the respondent at the first hearing.\nChristopher Robinson K.C. for the respondent at the second hearing.\nThe dissenting judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.:\u2014The respondent, Huggard Assets Limited, commenced an action in the Supreme Court of Alberta against the Attorney General and the Minister of Lands and Mines of Alberta for a declaration that the Lieutenant Governor in Council of the Province is not entitled to exact any royalty with respect to petroleum and natural gas produced from certain lands. The trial judge granted the respondent's claim and his judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division 2 on an equal division of opinion. The defendants now appeal and on a reargument in connection with certain points directed by the Court, the Attorney General of Canada was allowed to intervene when he supported the position taken by the appellants.\nThe lands in question are included in a Crown patent, dated August 25, 1913, issued on behalf of the Deputy Minister of the Interior at Ottawa to Northern Alberta Exploration Company, Limited, the respondent's predecessor in title. After reciting that the lands are Dominion lands within the meaning of The Dominion Lands Act, and that the Company had applied for a grant and, after due investigation, had been found entitled thereto \"in the terms herein embodied\", the patent proceeds to grant to the Company the surface rights in 1296.3 acres, including petroleum and natural gas rights, and the under rights in 1320.5 acres (the additional 24.2 acres being land covered by the waters of the Horse and Hanging Stone Creeks), reserving certain rights in, over and upon navigable waters, rights of fishery, and all mines and minerals except natural gas and petroleum,\nTO HAVE AND TO HOLD the same unto the grantee in fee simple. Yielding and paying unto Us and Our Successors such royalty upon the said petroleum and natural gas, if any, from time to time prescribed by regulations of Our Governor in Council, it being hereby declared that this grant is subject in all respects to the provisions of any such regulations with respect to royalty upon the said petroleum and natural gas or any of them, and to such regulations governing petroleum and natural gas as were in force on the First day of September in the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and nine, and that Our Minister of the Interior of Canada may by writing under his hand declare this grant to be null and void for default in the payment of such royalty or for any cause of forfeiture defined in such regulations, and that upon such declaration these presents and everything therein contained shall immediately become and be absolutely null and void.\nThe lands were part of Rupert's Land and the North West Territories, which, as of July 15, 1870, had been transferred to the Dominion by Imperial Order in Council of Her Majesty, dated January 23, 1870, passed in pursuance of the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867. By section 5 of the Dominion North West Territories Act (c. 3 of the Statutes of 1869) \"all the laws in force in Rupert's Land and the North Western Territory, at the time of their admission into the Union shall, so far as they are consistent with 'the British North America Act, 1867' \u2026 remain in force until altered by the Parliament of Canada or by the Lieutenant Governor under the authority of this Act.\" At the date of the Crown patent, the North West Territories Act was R.S.C. 1906, c. 62, and sections 12 and 13 thereof are as follows:\n12. Subject to the provisions of this Act, the laws of England relating to civil and criminal matters, as the same existed on the fifteenth day of July, in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy, shall be in force in the Territories, in so far as the same are applicable to the Territories, and in so far as the same have not been, or are not hereafter, as regards the Territories, repealed, altered, varied, modified, or affected by any Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom or of the Parliament of Canada, applicable to the Territories, or by any ordinance of the Territories.\n13. All laws and ordinances in force in the Territories, and not inconsistent with this Act, or repealed by the operation of the Act passed in the third year of His Majesty's reign, chapter sixty-one, and intituled An Act respecting the Revised Statutes of Canada, shall remain in force until it is otherwise provided or ordered by the Parliament of Canada, or by the Governor in Council or the Commissioner in Council.\nThe Crown in right of the Dominion was the allodial owner of all the land in the Territories and by the law of England as it existed on July 15, 1870, and in so far as it was applicable to the Territories, there was nothing to prevent the Crown granting lands in free and common socage whereby the estate granted might either be created or be defeated upon a certain event. This statement requires amplification and the matter will be adverted to later. However, in accordance with constitutional practice and law, the Crown could only dispose of the land, or any interest in it, upon being authorized by statute. The first question therefore is whether there was any such authority for the Crown Patent.\nAt the date of the patent, August 25, 1913, The Dominion Lands Act, referred to in one of the recitals in the patent, was chapter 20 of the Statutes of 1908. Sections 37 and 76(k) thereof read as follows:\n37. Lands containing salt, petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, silver, copper, iron or other minerals may be sold or leased under regulations made by the Governor in Council: and these regulations may provide for the disposal of mining rights underneath lands acquired or held as agricultural, grazing or hay lands, or any other lands held as to the surface only, but provision shall be made for the protection and compensation of the holders of the surface rights, in so far as they may be affected under these regulations.\n76. The Governor in Council may\u2014\n* * * (k) make such orders as are deemed necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act, according to their true intent, or to meet any cases which arise, and for which no provision is made in this Act; and further make any regulations which are considered necessary to give the provisions of this section full effect;\nSubsequent to the enactment of The Dominion Lands Act of 1908, no relevant regulations were made dealing generally with the sale of lands containing petroleum or natural gas, but prior thereto there had been several made under the authority of the Dominion Lands Acts of 1886 and 1906, put in at the trial as Exhibit 7. The case has proceeded on the basis that the regulations appearing in this office consolidation fall within the very words of the patent, which states it is subject to such regulations governing petroleum and natural gas as were in force on September 1, 1909.\nIt is admitted that at the date of the patent no royalty had been prescribed by regulation and the respondent contends that, while the office consolidated regulations were in force as of September 1, 1909, they are not relevant to the determination of this appeal in view of a certain order in council of March 21, 1913. Before turning to that and two others referring specifically to one Israel Bennetto or his assignee Northern Alberta Exploration Company, Limited, it will be convenient to set out the substance of the consolidated regulations.\nWhile the earlier paragraphs mention only petroleum, the final one provides that regulations for the reservation and sale of petroleum lands shall apply also to the reservation and sale of lands for natural gas purposes. Paragraph 1 provides that unappropriated Dominion lands shall be open to prospecting for petroleum, with power to the Minister to reserve for an individual or company who has machinery on the land to be prospected, an area of 1920 acres for such period as he may decide. By paragraph 2, this tract may be selected as soon as machinery has been placed on the ground but the length of such tract shall not exceed three times the breadth thereof. Where the circumstances of the case appear to be exceptional, the Minister may permit the selection to be made in areas of not less than a quarter-section or a fractional quarter- section. By paragraph 4, the Minister is empowered to make a preliminary reservation of an area of 1920 acres for a period of four months for the purpose of allowing an applicant sufficient time to install on the land the required machinery.\nParagraphs 5 and 6 provide:\n5. Should oil in paying quantities be discovered by a prospector on any vacant lands of the Crown, and should such discovery be established to the satisfaction of the Minister of the Interior, an area not exceeding 640 acres of land, including the oil well, will be sold to the person or company making such discovery at the rate of $1.00 per acre, and the remainder of the area reserved, namely, 1,280 acres, will be sold at the rate of $3.00 per acre. The patent for the land will convey the surface and the petroleum but will exclude all other minerals.\n6. A royalty at such rate as may from time to time be specified by Order in Council will also be levied and collected upon the sales of the petroleum, and it will be necessary for the person operating the location to furnish the Agent of Dominion Lands within whose district it is situated, with sworn returns monthly, or at such times as the Minister of the Interior may direct, accounting for the full quantity of oil obtained and sold, and pay the royalty thereon at the prescribed rate.\nBy paragraph 8:\n8. The patent which may be issued for petroleum lands will be made subject to the payment of the above royalty, and provision will be made therein that the Minister of the Interior may declare the patent to be null and void for default in the payment of the royalty on the sale of the petroleum.\nIt should next be noted that by order in council of March 11, 1910, for the disposal of petroleum and natural gas rights, the regulations included in the Office Consolidation of 1906 were rescinded and that, under paragraph 17 of the new regulations which came into force May 2, 1910, it was provided that should oil or natural gas in paying quantity be discovered in the leasehold to the satisfaction of the Minister, the lessee will be permitted to purchase, at the rate of ten dollars an acre, whatever area of the available surface rights of the tract described in the lease the Minister may consider necessary for the efficient operation of the rights granted him.\nIt was under these circumstances that Order in Council P.C. 1263 was passed on May 31, 1911. From this it appears that the Minister stated that on January 1, 1906, reservation was made under the late petroleum regulations of a certain tract of land to enable Israel Bennetto to carry on prospecting operations thereon; that this reservation, which was extended from time to time would expire June 17, 1911; that active boring operations were carried on upon the location in the summer of 1910; that there had been filed an assignment of Bennetto's rights to the Northern Alberta Exploration Company, Limited, and that an application had been submitted by the latter asking for a renewal of the reservation. The Minister observed: that the lands included within the tract reserved were, as to surface rights, claimed by a number of bona fide squatters upon the river lots and that it was not felt that the Department would be justified in continuing the reservation but, in view of the large expenditure incurred, the Minister recommended that reservation be made for a period of two years from June 17, 1911, in favour of the Company of the available petroleum and natural gas rights upon certain lands, and that reservation be also made of the available surface rights over the entire area for a period of one year, and that the available surface rights of a certain portion be reserved for two years from the same date. It continues:\nShould oil or natural gas be discovered in paying quantities within the period of one year from the 17th of June, 1911, the Minister also recommends that he be authorized to sell to the company, under the provisions of the old petroleum regulations, all the lands contained within the entire area above-mentioned both as regards the surface and petroleum and natural gas rights, and that if oil in paying quantities is discovered after the expiration of the first year, but before the 17th of June, 1913, he be authorized to sell to the company the petroleum and natural gas rights under the entire area reserved and the surface rights of that portion lying between the southerly boundary of the McMurray Settlement and Horse Creek.\nThe words in italics indicate the intention to give the Company the benefit of and subject it to the old petroleum regulations.\nBy Order in Council P.C. 627, dated March 2, 1913, relied upon by the respondent, the Acting Minister of the Interior submitted that the old petroleum regulations provided that the Minister might reserve for an individual or company who had machinery on the land to be prospected, an area of 1920 acres, and in case oil in paying quantities were discovered, an area not exceeding 640 acres would be sold to the discoverer at the rate of $1.00 an acre and the remaining 1,280 acres at $3.00 an acre, the patent to convey the petroleum and natural gas but to exclude all other minerals; the activities of Bennetto and the Company were then set out as in the order in council of May 31, 1911. In view of the very large expenditure of at least $75,000 which the Company had incurred for the purpose of demonstrating the existence or otherwise of petroleum, which demonstrations must be of very great public benefit, and in view of the fact that the location first reserved for the application was lost to the applicant through the encroachment of squatters, the Minister recommended \"that the above company be permitted to purchase the petroleum and natural gas rights under the entire area reserved for them by the Order in Council dated the 31st of May, 1911, together with the available surface rights thereof, at the rate of $3.00 an acre, subject, however, to such rights as may be established under the provisions of the Dominion Lands Act and the regulations, by any persons in a position to show that they have in the meantime squatted upon these lands.\"\nThe only other order in council referred to by the parties is one of June 6, 1914, which after reciting the order in council of March 21, 1913, and the granting of a patent thereunder for the petroleum and natural gas rights and the available surface rights, and the representation that a portion of the surface of the tract so acquired was covered by a deposit of tar-sand or asphalt, proceeded to state that the Minister recommended that, as asphalt would appear to be a product of petroleum and there appeared to be some ground for the contention that it formed a portion of the surface of the land, he be authorized to issue supplementary letters patent conveying the right to the asphalt which might be upon those lands. The circumstance, relied upon by the respondent, that this order in council made no provision for a royalty has no significance.\nP.C. 1263 (May 31, 1911) and P.C. 627 (March 2, 1913) must be read together and in the light of section 76(k) of the Dominion Lands Act of 1908. So read, the Crown Patent was issued under the old regulations as they appeared in the 1906 Office Consolidation but varied as to the purchase price. If the new regulations of March 1910 applied, the price per acre would be materially increased but, after taking into consideration the substantial sums expended for exploration by the Company, it was considered fair and equitable that the price should be $3.00 per acre throughout instead of $1.00 per acre for the first 640 acres and $3.00 per acre for the remainder of the area reserved. The old regulations (para. 6) provided for a royalty \"at such rate as may, from time to time, be specified by order in council\" and hence the reddendum in the Crown Patent. In my opinion there was statutory authority for the patent.\nChapter 24 of 12 Car. II (1660), requires attention. At page 47 of the first edition of Armour on Real Property, which was based on Leith and Smith's edition of the second volume of Blackstone's Commentaries (in a chapter omitted in the second edition to make room for more practical matter), the author points out that the effect of this statute was to destroy the military tenures with all their heavy appendages, and in Challis's Real Property, 3rd edition, pp. 59-60, it is pointed out that by that statute all tenures, with irrelevant exceptions, were reduced to free and common socage but that from certain modifications which the law permitted to be imposed upon it were derived determinable fees, conditional fees. In the second edition of Armour, at page 159 (which is the same as on page 161 of the first edition), an estate on condition expressed in the grant itself is dealt with as follows:\n3. Express Conditions.\nAn estate on condition expressed in the grant itself, is where an estate is granted either in fee simple or otherwise, with an express qualification, annexed, whereby the estate granted shall either commence, be enlarged, or be defeated, upon performance or breach of such qualification or condition. Or, as defined in the Touchstone (P.117), \"it is a modus, a quality annexed by him that hath estate, interest, or right, to the land, etc., whereby an estate, etc., may either be created, defeated, or enlarged, upon a certain event. And this doth differ from a limitation, which is the bounds or compass of an estate, or the time how long an estate shall continue.\" Or, \"a condition is a qualification or restriction annexed to a conveyance of land, whereby it is provided that, in case a particular event does or does not happen, or in case the grantor or grantee does, or omits to do, a particular act, an estate shall commence, be enlarged, or defeated\" (Cru. Dig. Tit. 13, s. 1). In Cheshire's Modern Real Property, 6th edition, at page 29, it is stated:\na grantor exhausts his powers of alienation when he grants a fee simple, for the law is ignorant of any greater estate, but he may annex a condition to the grant, so as to make the estate come to an end on the occurrence of a certain event.\nAnd at page 515:\nAn interest upon condition subsequent arises where a qualification is annexed to a conveyance, whereby it is provided that, in case a particular event does or does not happen, or in case the grantor or the grantee does or omits to do a particular act, the interest shall be defeated.\nAs defined by the pleadings, the precise issue to be determined is whether or not the Crown had the right to impose a royalty and not whether the Crown had the right to declare the grantee's estate forfeited for failure to pay the royalty. Yet these two matters are interwoven and the general rule may be taken to be that expressed by the maxim id certum est, quod certum reddi potest. Coke upon Littleton. 96a., puts it thus:\nIt is a maxim in law, that no distresse can be taken for any services that are not put into certaintie, nor can be reduced to any certainty; for, id certum est, quod certum reddi potest; for oportet quod certa res deducatur in judicium: and upon the avowry, damages cannot be recovered for that which neither hath certainty, nor can be reduced to any certainty. And yet in some cases there may be a certainty in uncertainty; as a man may hold of his lord to sheere all the sheepe depasturing within the lord's manor; and this is certaine enough, albeit the lord hath sometime a greater number, and sometime a lesser number there; and yet this incertainty, being referred to the manner which is certaine, the lord may distrain for this uncertainty. Et sic de similibus.\nThis is quoted with approval by Lord Denman in Daniel v. Gracie 3.\nIn Cooper v. Stuart 4, the Judicial Committee had to deal with a clause in a Crown grant in New South Wales \"reserving to His Majesty, his heirs and successors \u2026 any quantity of land not exceeding ten acres in any part of the said grant as may be required for public purposes.\" Although the precise point was not argued, their Lordships had no difficulty in deciding that the reservation was valid. In my view the royalty reserved in the present case is certain within the meaning of the rule. Before leaving the case of Cooper v. Stuart (2), it should be noted that the decision is authority for the proposition that the rule in Forbes v. Git 5, that if in a deed an earlier clause is followed by a later one which destroys altogether the obligation created by the earlier clause, the latter is to be rejected as repugnant and the earlier clause prevail, does not apply where the reservation takes effect in defeasance of the estate previously granted and not as an exception.\nThe judges in the Courts below who decided in favour of the respondent considered that, on construction, the case was determined by the decision of this Court in Attorney General of Alberta v. Majestic Mines Limited (2). The wording in the patent in question in that case, however, is quite different from the one before us. Here, the words are \"Yielding and paying unto us and our successors such royalty upon the said petroleum and natural gas, if any, from time to time prescribed by regulations of Our Governor in Council.\" The words \"from time to time prescribed\" do not appear in the grant considered in the Majestic Mines Case 6 and I agree with Mr. Justice Parlee, speaking on behalf of himself and Mr. Justice Ford, that they are prospective.\nThis is a power or right which by a contract, lease or other arrangement was reserved to the Governor in Council within the meaning of clause 3 of the Agreement for the Transfer of the Natural Resources of Alberta, scheduled to the Alberta Natural Resources Act , chapter 3 of the Dominion Statutes of 1930 and therefore transferred to the Province. As stated by Sir Lyman Duff, speaking on behalf of the Court, in Reference re Refund of Dues paid under Section 47(f) of Timber Regulations 7, with reference to clause 2 of the same agreement:\nThe subject of the clause comprises two classes of arrangements, (1) contracts \"to purchase or lease any Crown lands, mines or minerals,\" and (2) \"every other arrangement whereby any person has become entitled to any interest therein as against the Crown.\"\nIt is quite impossible, of course, to contend that the second class includes only arrangements which are strictly contracts, because if that had been the purpose of the clause, the word \"contract\" would have been used, instead of \"arrangement,\" to describe the kind of transactions falling within it. The decision of this Court in that case was affirmed by the Judicial Committee 8, and Lord Wright, at page 197, states :\nThe word \"arrangement\" is as Parke B. said in Manning v. Eastern Counties Ry. Co. \"a very wide and indefinite one\".\nIn Re Timber Regulations for Manitoba 9, the Judicial Committee decided that the Transfer Agreement with Manitoba amounted to a statutory novation and that case was followed as to the Province of Alberta, by this Court, in Anthony v. Attorney General for Alberta 10. Leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee was refused.\nIt is alleged that the present respondent took title without notice of the reddendum in the patent but this cannot avail it in view of the provisions of section 61 of The Land Titles Act, R.S.A. 1942, chapter 205:\n61. (1) The land mentioned in any certificate of title granted under this Act shall by implication and without any special mention therein, unless the contrary is expressly declared, be subject to,\n(a) any subsisting reservations or exceptions contained in the original grant of the land from the Crown:\nThe certificates of title relied upon by the respondent have an endorsement stating that the land or mines and minerals are subject to this implied provision. The word \"reservation\" is wide enough to include the provision for royalty.\nFinally, as Mr. Justice Parlee points out, there is no evidence that would entitle the plaintiff to rectification of the patent. The appeal should be allowed, the action dismissed and the appellants entitled to judgment on their counter-claim. By arrangement, there are to be no costs.\nRand J.:\u2014This appeal raises the question whether the Lieutenant Governor in Council of Alberta is entitled to exact a royalty in respect of petroleum and natural gas produced from certain lands owned by the respondent in that province. They were granted in fee simple in 1914 by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of Canada. The grant was authorized by orders-in-council made under the Dominion Lands Act, R.S.C. (1886) c. 54, as amended in 1892 by c. 15. Section 100 of c. 55, R.S.C. (1906) provided generally for the disposal of the western Crown lands:\n100. Dominion lands, as the surveys thereof are duly made and confirmed, shall, except as otherwise herein provided, be open for purchase, at such prices, and on such terms and conditions as are fixed, from time to time, by the Governor in Council; but no purchase shall be permitted at a less price than one dollar per acre, and, except in special cases in which the Governor in Council otherwise orders, no sale to one person shall exceed a section, or six hundred and forty acres.\nSection 6(i) authorized regulations:\n6. The Governor in Council may,\n(i) make such orders as are deemed necessary, from time to time, to carry out the provisions of this Act, according to their true intent, or to meet any cases which arise, and for which no provision is made in this Act; and further make and declare any regulations which are considered necessary to give the provisions in this section contained full effect; and, from time to time, alter or revoke any order or orders or any regulations made in respect of the said provisions, and make others in their stead;\nSection 159 dealt with mineral lands:\n159. Lands containing coal or other minerals, including lands in the Rocky Mountains Park, shall not be subject to the provisions of this Act respecting sale or homestead entry, but the Governor in Council may, from time to time, make regulations for the working and development of mines on such lands, and for the sale, leasing, licensing or other disposal thereof.\nThe first regulation governing petroleum was approved by His Excellency on August 6, 1898; it provided for the reservation for a period of six months of an area not exceeding 640 acres for prospecting purposes, and that if oil was found in paying quantities, the land and mineral might be sold at the rate of $1.00 per acre, reserving a royalty of 2\u00bd per cent upon the sales; its application was confined to lands situated south of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the district of Alberta. This was replaced by one of May 31, 1901 extending the application to unappropriated lands in Manitoba, Northwest Territories and Yukon Territory; providing a royalty at such rate as might from time to time be specified by order-in-council on the sales of the petroleum and for sworn monthly returns; and stipulating that the patent would be made \"subject to the payment of the above royalty\", and to forfeiture on default in payment. Further amendments were made in 1902, 1904, 1905 and 1906, but, except as they were extended to natural gas, they do not affect the question before us. In 1908 c. 55 R.S.C. 1906 was repealed and replaced by c. 20 of the statutes of that year. In 1910 new regulations restricted the disposal of mineral lands to leasehold interests.\nApplication for the lands was made by Israel Benneto on January 1, 1906, and in the course of the next five years substantial work was done by way of exploration and the sinking of a well. By 1911 approximately $75,000 had been expended, and by an order-in-council of May 31 of that year special provisions were made. The order recited the application and reservation, the operations carried on, the assignment of rights to the Northern Alberta Exploration Company Limited, and the request for a further renewal of the reservation; but that it had appeared that within the original tract squatters had acquired rights which, in the opinion of the Department, presented an obstacle to the renewal as requested. In view, however, of the large sum expended, the order provided for a reservation for two years to expire on June 17, 1913 of petroleum, natural gas and surface rights over another area of 1920 acres which embraced a portion of the former tract; that should oil or gas be discovered in paying quantities within one year from June 17, 1911 the Minister was empowered to sell the entire acreage under the earlier regulations; but that if the discovery should not be made until after that date though before June 17, 1913, to sell the available oil and gas rights in the tract and the surface rights of a described portion of it. Following this, and under the authority of a further order-in-council of March 21, 1913, by patent dated the 18 of March, 1914, the available surface rights to the extent of 1296 acres, and the available mineral rights for 1320 acres, were conveyed to the company at the rate of $3.00 an acre. The difference in acreage resulted from the retention of the surface area of a creek running through the tract. The grant is seen to have been made on the authority of and subject to cumulative and modified provisions of orders-in-council, all of which had been advertised in the Canada Gazette as required by sec. 8 of the Act.\nThe patent reserved certain rights in and over navigable waters, certain rights of fishery with incidental privileges, all mines and minerals except gas and petroleum, and all rights acquired by squatters. Then followed a reddendum clause:\nYIELDING and paying unto Us and Our Successors such royalty upon the said petroleum and natural gas, if any, from time to time prescribed by regulations of Our Governor in Council, it being hereby declared that this grant is subject in all respects to the provisions of any such regulations with respect to royalty upon the said petroleum and natural gas or any of them, and to such regulations governing petroleum and natural gas as were in force on the First day of September in the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and nine, and that our Minister of the Interior of Canada may by writing under his hand declare this grant to be null and void for default in the payment of such royalty or for any cause of forfeiture defined in such regulations, and that upon such declaration these presents and everything therein contained shall immediately become and be absolutely null and void.\nI construe that language to describe a royalty that from time to time after the issue of the patent might be provided by regulations: there was no specific royalty so existing at the time of the grant.\nAs of July 15, 1870, Rupert's Land and the Northwest Territories were transferred to the Dominion. By sec. 21 of the Alberta Act of 1905, creating the province, all public lands and real interests were retained by the Dominion. In 1930 by the Alberta Natural Resources Act the then remaining lands and interests of the Dominion were transferred to the province, the effect of which, as to rights and obligations, was to establish a statutory novation: In re Timber Regulations for Manitoba 11. Up to that moment, the retained proprietary rights were within the administration of the Dominion for the purposes of the Dominion and in all respects subject to the jurisdiction of Parliament: In re Natural Resources of Saskatchewan 12; A.G. Alberta v. A.G. Canada 13. But from the creation of the province it is clear that any interests disposed of by the Dominion would automatically come under its exclusive jurisdiction through the force of sec. 92 of the Confederation Act.\nBy sec. 11 of the Dominion Lands Act, 1906, the administration of the lands was entrusted to the Minister of Interior, to be carried out subject to the provisions of the Act and regulations made by order-in-council. What was the nature of these regulations? They were intended, clearly, to be administrative and so far legislative in character; but in relation to grants, I am unable to discover any power to introduce by them new incidents of land ownership by reservation or otherwise in the ordinary instrument of conveyance. Conceivably they might regulate from time to time royalties payable on leases or even patented lands prior to the establishment of the province; but as legislation, from and after that time they could have no application to granted lands or interests; nor could any such sub-legislation authorize grants creating reservations which, under the existing law of real property, would be invalid.\nInterpreting the patent, then, in the light of that law, I am forced to the conclusion that the reservation of royalties purporting to be made is void for uncertainty. As the statute of Quia Emptores did not apply to the Crown, such a reservation is strictly a rent service, that is \"a retribution\" made to the Crown by the beneficiary of the grant. But by the statute of 1660, c. 24, all tenures, with minor exceptions not relevant here, were converted into that of free and common socage, a provision of law which, by the Northwest Territories Act of 1875 as amended in 1886, became law for the western lands; and under that tenure it was essential that the service should be certain. Blackstone, in Book II, cap. 5 of Lewis's Edition, emphasizes this special necessity in socage tenure: after contrasting the uncertainties of knight-service, and after dwelling somewhat on the scutage, or \"escuage\", which had it \"been a settled invariable sum, payable at certain times, it had been neither more or less than a mere pecuniary rent; and the tenure, instead of knight-service would have been of another kind, called socage, of which we shall speak in the next chapter,\" describes socage as denoting a tenure by any \"certain and determinate service.\" This he illustrates by the examples of \"fealty and 20s. rent\" or \"homage and fealty without rent\" or \"certain corporal service as ploughing the Lord's lands for three days;\" and observes: \"It was the certainty, therefore, that denominated it a socage tenure, and nothing sure could be a greater liberty or privilege than to have the service ascertained and not left to the arbitrary calls of the lord as the tenures of chivalry.\" He observes that the \"grand criterion and distinguishing mark of this species of tenure are the having its renders or services ascertained; it will include under it all other methods of holding free lands by certain and invariable rents and duties;\" of a \"certain established rent;\" and finally, in his summary, at page 86, that \"in the military tenure, or more proper feud, this was from its nature uncertain, in socage, which was a feud of the improper kind, it was certain, fixed and determinate (though perhaps nothing more than bare fealty) and so continues to this day.\" The reservation here, by leaving the rate in money or in kind at which the royalty from time to time should be levied, in the discretion of the Crown, embodies the essence of the evil which led to the legislation of 1660.\nAssuming this, Mr. Steer argues that the patent itself was void on the ground that as the regulations stipulated for such a reservation, a patent could issue only if it carried out effectively their terms. The Dominion Lands Act doubtlessly exhausts the prerogative power to dispose of Crown lands. That is clear whether we treat the statute of 1702, which limited the disposing power of the Crown over lands in England, to have been introduced into the Northwest Territories by the Act of 1875 or not. The circumstances in which the statute of 1702 was enacted are not at all comparable with those of a colony, the initial development of which must necessarily be one of the main functions of executive government; and certainly it was not observed by the colonial administration prior to Confederation. But sec. 100 recognizes that residual power so far as the provisions of the statute do not fetter it; and secs. 6(i) and 159 neither require the regulations to be of any particular or general nature nor exclude special provisions for special cases where no prohibition is infringed. The patent was, undoubtedly, issued as the conclusion of an application made under the regulations; but assuming the incorporation of the latter in the transaction as a whole, if, so far as they professed to provide for novel incidents of property in the patent, they were beyond the power of the Governor-in-Council to make they must be disregarded, and the conveyance, otherwise within the statutory authority, held valid.\nThe lands, including the oil and gas rights, then, having been conveyed, nothing remained to pass to the province in 1930 except the right of escheat; and since the claim for royalty under the provincial order-in-council is based on a reservation, transferred in 1930, that failing, the claim fails.\nI do not understand the statement of claim to allege an intention on the part of the province to seek by order-in-council to subject the lands to a condition based on the language of the reservation of royalty, but taken apart from its effectiveness as such. As contained in the grant, the condition obviously assumes a valid reservation and it would fall with the latter. But considered even as detached from the reservation, it is fatally defective. That conditions must be certain, precise and ascertainable from the terms of the instrument is a rule with ancient roots in the common law; it was applied by this Court as late as last year in Noble v. Alley 14; and a condition, the substance of which lies within the will of the grantor, is outside of that requirement.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal. There will be no costs.\nKellock J.:\u2014The patent here in question was granted subsequent to 7-8 Ed. VII, c. 20, by s. 37 of which it is provided that\nlands containing salt, petroleum, natural gas \u2026 may be sold or leased under regulations made by the Governor in Council.\nThis legislation replaced s. 159 of R.S.C. 1906, c. 55, which read:\nLands containing coal or other minerals \u2026 shall not be subject to the provisions of this Act respecting sale or homestead entry, but the Governor in Council may from time to time make regulations for the working and development of mines on such lands and for the sale, leasing, licensing or other disposal thereof.\nBy s. 6 of the same Act, the Governor in Council was authorized to\n(i) make such orders as are deemed necessary from time to time to carry out the provisions of this Act according to their true intent or to meet any cases which arise and for which no provision is made in this Act \u2026 S. 76(k) of the Act of 1908 reproduces this provision.\nRegulations which had been passed under earlier legislation were in force at the time of the passing of the Act of 1908, and the order-in-council authorizing the patent had reference to these regulations. The patent itself is an express grant in fee simple, and it contains the provision relied upon by the appellant which in turn is in conformity with the regulations.\nWhile Parliament, as the unitary legislature for the territory in question, could, doubtless, have created estates not then known to the law, it is plain that, apart from such legislation, \"the King cannot make law or custom by his grant;\" Chitty on Prerogatives of the Crown, p. 386. I find nothing in the above legislation which contemplates disposal of mineral lands so as to create estates therein of a novel character. The question, therefore, in the case at bar is as to whether the provision in the patent, authorizing the grantor to exact \"such royalty \u2026 from time to time prescribed by regulations of our Governor in Council\" upon the petroleum and natural gas, was a valid provision under which an interest remained in the Dominion and passed to the province by virtue of the Natural Resources Act of 1930. The case for the appellant is exclusively rested on this basis and not upon any legislative jurisdiction in either the Dominion or the province apart from the terms of the patent. In my opinion, the provision in question is not effective for such a purpose but is void as repugnant to the grant.\nAnciently, according to Blackstone Vol. 2, p. 60 ff., there were four principal species of lay tenures, the grand criteria of which were the nature of the several services or \"renders\" that were due to the lords from their tenants. These services in respect of their quality were either free or base, and in respect of their quantity and the time of exacting them, were either certain or uncertain. Free services were such as were not unbecoming the character of a soldier or a freeman to perform, while base services were such as were only fit for peasants or persons of a servile rank. \"Certain\" services, whether free or base, were such as were stinted in quantity and could not be exceeded on any pretext; for example, to pay a stated annual rent or to plough such a field for three days. \"Uncertain\" services depended upon unknown contingencies; as, in the case of free services, to do military service in person or pay an assessment in lieu of it when called upon; or, in the case of base services, to do whatever the lord should command. Where the service was free but uncertain, as military service with homage, the tenure was called tenure in chivalry, or knight service. Where the service was not only free but also certain, as by fealty only, by rent and fealty, etc., that tenure was called free socage. Tenure by knight service was abolished by the statute of 12 Car. II, c. 24, and turned into free and common socage. This statute expressly extended to the Crown. At p. 78 Black stone, in speaking of the services in the case of free socage, says that they were\nsuch as were liquidated and reduced to an absolute certainty. And this tenure not only subsists to this day, but has in a manner absorbed and swallowed up (since the statute of Charles the Second) almost every other species of tenure.\nThe author goes on at p. 80 to state that\nIt was the certainty, therefore, that denominated it a socage tenure; and nothing sure could be a greater liberty or privilege, than to have the services ascertained, and not left to the arbitrary calls of the lord, as the tenures of chivalry.\nAt p. 81:\nAs therefore the grand criterion and distinguishing mark of this species of tenure are the having its renders or services ascertained, it will include under it all other methods of holding free lands by certain and invariable rents and duties.\nAs the statute Quia Emptores did not apply to the Crown, of whom the tenant in fee simple holds his lands, rent payable to the Crown in such cases is a rent service which, as distinguished from a rent charge, requires a tenure to support it.\nIt has been held that royalties of the nature of that here in question are true rents; Reg. v. Westbrook 15; Daniel v. Gracie 16; Barrs v. Lea 17; Edmonds v. East wood 18; 20 Halsbury, 2nd Edition, 158. Being rent, it is essential in every case that the element of certainty exist in order to its enforcement. As stated in Halsbury Vol. 20, 2nd Edition, at p. 160:\nThe rent must be certain, or must be so stated that it can afterwards be ascertained with certainty. For this purpose it is sufficient if by calculation and upon the happening of certain events it becomes certain; and provided it can be so ascertained from time to time, it is no objection that the rent is of fluctuating amount.\nApart from authority, it is difficult to see on principle how a rent, dependent upon nothing but the will of the grantee, can be said to be certain. No authority has been cited which supports the appellant's position, and I think there is authority to the contrary. Halsbury, in a note to the citation last mentioned above, refers to what is said in Coke upon Littleton at 96a, namely,\nIt is a maxim in law, that no distresse can be taken for any services that are not put into certaintie, nor can be reduced to any certainty; for, id certum est, quod certum reddi potest \u2026 And yet in some cases there may be a certainty in uncertainty; as a man may hold of his lord to sheere all the sheepe depasturing within the lord's manor; and this is certain enough, albeit the lord hath sometime a greater number, and sometime a lesser number there; and yet this incerbainty, being referred to the mannor which is certaine, the lord may distrain for this uncertainty. Et sic de similibus.\nThis is cited by Lord Denman in Daniel v. Gracie, ubi cit., in which, under a demise of a marl pit and brick mine, the tenant to pay 8d. per solid yard for all the marl he got and Is. 8d. per thousand for all the bricks he made, it was held that the rent was certain as it was capable of being ascertained with certainty. At p. 153, Lord Denman said:\nIn the present instance, however, the rent is reserved in money; and the amount is, according to the criterion of Lord Coke, capable of being ascertained, \"certum reddi potest\", by the number of cubic yards of marl and slack got in the one case, and of bricks made in the other.\nThere is nothing in this case which suggests that rent at a rate not stated may be made certain by the exercise of the will of the grantor or lessor. Nor in my opinion, with respect, does the illustration given by Lord Coke go so far. The number of sheep would be determined each year by the number actually depasturing on the land at the relevant date. I think it is clear upon the authorities that the certainty must be capable of ascertainment by reason of some collateral event apart from the mere will of the grantor. As put in 10 Halsbury, 2nd Edition, at p. 446:\nBut the rent is certain if by calculation and upon the happening of certain events, it becomes certain.\nReference is made in the text to Ex parte Voisey 19. In that case, Brett L.J., as he then was, said at p. 458: Now it is true that, if that which is agreed upon as the payment is uncertain, it is not a rent. It must be certain. But the rent is certain if, by calculation and upon the happening of certain events, it becomes certain \u2026 But here it seems to me that, upon the happening of the condition named, the rent fixes itself and is therefore a certain rent.\nThe point is made very clear, it seems to me, by Lord Chief Baron Gilbert in his treatise on rents at p. 9, where he says:\nWhen the services are expressed in the contract, the quantum must be either certainly mentioned, or be such, as by reference to something else may be reduced to a certainty.\nThe same idea is expressed in Woodfall, 24th Edition, at p. 307, as follows:\nThe reservation of rent, however, ought to be certain as to the amount and the time when payable; although if there be anything in the reservation by which the amount of the rent may be ascertained, this will be as good as if the sum itself were clearly specified, in accordance with the maxim Id certum est quod certum reddi potest.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the provision here in question lacks the necessary certainty. It is in effect a throwback to the old days of tenures by knight service which permitted rent services based on the \"arbitrary calls of the lord.\"\nThe appellant, however, seeks to support the clause in question on the ground of common law condition subsequent. Counsel referred to a number of definitions, all to the same effect, and it will be sufficient to refer to that contained in Cheshire's Modern Real Property, 6th Edition, at p. 515:\nAn interest upon condition subsequent arises where a qualification is annexed to a conveyance, whereby it is provided that, in case a particular event does or does not happen, or in case the grantor or the grantee does or omits to do a particular act, the interest shall be defeated.\nI am content to take it that the provision in the patent here in question falls within the words of this definition. By the express terms of the patent, the grant may be declared void for default in payment of\nsuch royalty upon the said petroleum and natural gas, if any, from time to time prescribed by regulations of Our Governor in Council.\n(i.e., default in payment of royalty at any rate which may in future be imposed).\nHowever, if the reservation of future royalty is void for uncertainty, as in my opinion it is, it must follow that the forfeiture for breach of a condition which is founded upon such a reservation, must fall with the latter.\nThe appellant relies upon the decision of the Privy Council in Cooper v. Stuart 20, which was concerned with a Crown grant of land in New South Wales containing a right to resume any quantity of the lands granted not exceeding ten acres as might be required for public purposes. This was held valid.\nWhat was actually decided in that case is thrown into relief when contrasted with the decision in Pearce v. Watts 21 which was concerned with a contract for the sale of an estate, the vendor reserving \"the necessary land for making a railway\" through the estate to Prince Town. The suit, which was for specific performance, failed, it being held that the reservation was void for uncertainty. In his judgment, Sir George Jessel M.R. considers the situation which would have existed had there been a conveyance, in the following language at p. 493 :\nIf the conveyance were executed in this form, it is obvious, according to the present law, the whole land would pass to the purchaser, the reservation being void for uncertainty.\nIt may well be that the reservation in the above case was not a true reservation but rather an exception, but in either view it is essential that the parcel which is the subject of the reservation or exception should have certainty. In Cooper's case, it was fixed in amount, namely, ten acres, whereas in Pearce's case there was complete uncertainty and it could not be rendered certain by the grantor's election to have what he considered necessary for a railway.\nI think, therefore, that it does not assist the appellant to invoke the doctrine of condition subsequent. In my opinion, the purported reservation of royalty in the patent is void, and the grant is absolute in the hands of the grantee. The principle is very old and is stated in Black-stone at p. 156 as follows:\nThese express conditions, if they be \u2026 contrary to law, are void. In any of which cases, if they be conditions subsequent, that is, to be performed after the estate is vested, the estate shall become absolute in the tenant.\nI would dismiss the appeal. It was agreed there should be no costs. Estey J.:\u2014I am in agreement with the reasons expressed by my brothers Rand and Kellock.\nThe appeal should be dismissed without costs.\nCartwright J.\u2014For the reasons given by my brothers Rand and Kellock I would dismiss the appeal, without costs.\nAppeal dismissed; no costs.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General of Canada: F.

Each phrase is to be construed as standing alone and neither is to be taken as connoting criminal negligence.\nPer: Kerwin J.\u2014Where by statute the liability of a municipal corporation has been limited to cases of gross negligence, this Court has declined to define that expression other than to say that it might be given the meaning of \"very great negligence\". Kingston v. Drennan, 27 Can. S.C.R. 46; followed in German v. City of Ottawa, 56 Can. S.C.R. 80 and Holland v. City of Toronto, [1927] S.C.R. 242; 59 O.L.R. 628. This Court has also declined to define \"gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct\" in a case arising under legislation in Nova Scotia similar to s. 141(2) of the Saskatchewan Vehicles Act. In connection with the latter statute it is sufficient to say that gross negligence may be stated to be very great negligence and it must be left to the trial judge in each case to put the matter to the jury in that way with such reference to the evidence as may be necessary.

It cannot however be said that a jury must find in every case that the driver's conduct amounts to a reckless disregard of consequences before they can find that conduct constitutes gross negligence.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, [1950] 1 W.W.R. 780, affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 1, dismissing their appeal from a judgment by Thomson J. on a jury trial.\nG. H. Yule K.C. for the appellants.\nE. M. Hall K.C. for the respondents.\nKerwin J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the defendants, Gerald L. Studer and Raymond N. Studer, the owner and operator, respectively, of an automobile, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan dismissing their appeal from the judgment rendered after a trial with a jury. The plaintiff respondent is Bernice Avis Cowper, an infant sixteen years of age, suing by her father as next friend, for damages for injuries received while she was in the motor vehicle driven by Raymond Studer. As a gratuitous passenger, Bernice is subject to the provisions of subs. 2 of s. 141 of The Vehicles Act, c. 98, of the 1945 Statutes of Saskatchewan:\n141. (2). The owner or driver of a motor vehicle, other than a vehicle ordinarily used for carrying passengers for hire or gain, shall not be liable for loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to or the death of any person being carried in or upon, or entering, or getting on to, or alighting from such motor vehicle, unless there has been gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct on the part of the driver of the vehicle and unless such gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct contributed to the injury.\nAfter alleging gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct on the part of the driver, the statement of claim continues (para. 6):\n6. The gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct on the part of the defendant Raymond N. Studer consisted of:\n(a) He knew, or should have known, that he was approaching the railway crossing referred to in Paragraph 4, hereof.\n(b) He was driving the said Dodge Sedan at a speed of sixty (60) miles an hour or more northward on said Lome Avenue road as he approached said railway crossing at a time when the said road was, to his knowledge, covered with snow and\/or ice and unsafe for driving at such speed or at any speed in excess of twenty (20) miles an hour.\n(c)He knew, or should have known, that, at the speed at which he was travelling, he would not be able to bring the said Dodge Sedan to a stop in time to avoid a collision in the event that a train should come or be upon the said railway crossing.\n(d)He was \"showing off\" and seeking to impress the infant plaintiff with his reckless handling of the Dodge Sedan.\n(e)He failed to observe that a box freight car was on said railway crossing as he approached the said crossing.\n(f) He was keeping no proper or any look-out as he approached the said railway crossing.\n(g) He was not giving due attention to the driving of the said Dodge Sedan at the said time.\n(h) He was driving the said Dodge Sedan with a reckless disregard of consequences.\nWith the consent of all parties, this paragraph was handed to the jury. The questions to be submitted to them had been agreed to by counsel for all parties, and the relevant questions, together with the answers thereto, given after a charge that is not objected to, read as follows:\n1. Was there on the part of the Defendant Raymond Studer gross negligence, or wilful and wanton misconduct which caused the accident?\nAnswer: Yes.\n2. If so, of what did such gross negligence, or wilful and wanton misconduct consist?\nAnswer: Statement of Claim sections a, c, f, g.\n(a) He knew or should have known, that he was approaching the railway crossing referred to in paragraph 4 hereof (The Statement of Claim).\n(c) He knew, or should have known, that at the speed at which he was travelling, he would not be able to bring the said Dodge Sedan to a stop in time to avoid a collision in the event that a train should come or be upon the said railway crossing. (f) He was keeping no proper or any look-out as he approached the said railway crossing.\n(g) He was not giving due attention to the driving of the said Dodge Sedan at the said time.\nFor the appellant, Mr. Yule argued that the jury must be taken to have negatived the allegation in clause (h) of paragraph 6 of the statement of claim since no affirmative finding was made with reference to it. If one considered that clause by itself, that might be taken for granted but, in view of the charge and the answer to the first question, wherein the jury found that there was gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct on the part of the driver, and in view of the finding that particulars thereof were to be found in clauses (a), (c), (f) and (g), it may be confidently asserted that clause (h) is not exclusive of any idea fairly included in the other clauses specified by the jury. In my view such an idea is so included. Nor can it be said that none of these other clauses, or at any rate all of them together, are not capable in law of being gross negligence. In view of the fact that counsel for the respondent suggested that the two alternatives be put to the jury separately but bowed to the trial judge's ruling that the question be put as framed, and that all the questions were agreed to by counsel for the appellants, no objection may now be taken to the finding that Raymond N. Studer was guilty of gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct.\nMr. Yule then argued that the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan had decided in Shortt v. Rush and British American Oil Co. Ltd. 2; Lloyd v. Milton and Derkson 3, reversed (1938) S.C.R. 315; Heck v. Braun and Marchuk 4; that the idea of criminality, in order to find a person guilty on a charge of criminal negligence, must exist before a driver of a gratuitous passenger could be found responsible under the relevant legislation. He then proceeded to argue that because these decisions were upon similar legislation which was re-enacted thereafter, it should be taken that the legislature adopted that construction\u2014relying upon what was said by Anglin J. in Canadian Pacific Railway v. Albin 5, speaking on behalf of himself, Sir Louis Davies C.J., and Mignault J.:\u2014\nAlthough s.s. 4 of s. 12 of the \"Interpretation Act\" (R.S.C. ch. 1, in force since 1890 (53 Vict., ch. 7, s. 1) declares that\n\"Parliament shall not be re-enacting any Act or enactment or by revising, consolidating or amending the same be deemed to have adopted the construction which has, by judicial decision or otherwise, been placed upon the language used in such Act, or upon similar language.\"\nWe\ncannot assume that the Dominion Legislature when they re-enacted the clause verbatim (in 1903 and again in 1906) were in ignorance of the judicial interpretation which it had received. It must on the contrary be assumed that they understood that (s. 92 of the Act of 1888) must have been acted upon in the light of that interpretation.\nCasgrain v. Atlantic and North West Ry. Co. 6, at page 300.\nHe might have added to that citation what was said by Duff, J., speaking on behalf of himself, Mignault, New-combe, and Rinfret JJ., in Orpen v. Roberts 7, as at 374:\nAlthough by sec. 20 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.O. (1914), the legislature is not to be presumed by reason merely of having re-enacted a statutory provision without changing its language to have adopted a previous judicial construction of that language, nevertheless, the history of the legislation, when read in light of the course of judicial decision and opinion touching the effect of it, may, independently of the intrinsic weight of such decisions and opinions, afford convincing evidence of the intention of the legislature. There appears to be little room for doubt that in this instance the Appellate Division has accurately interpreted that intention.\nIn view of these decisions, it must now be taken that subsection 4 of s. 24 of the Saskatchewan Interpretation Act, 1943, c. 2, which is the same as the ones referred to in the two cases mentioned, merely removes the presumption that existed at common law and, in a proper case, it will be held that a legislature did have in mind the construction that had been placed upon a certain enactment when re-enacting it. In the present case it is apparent that the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan did not consider that it had laid it down that the same elements that are required in a charge of criminal negligence must be present under the Saskatchewan legislation here in question but, in order to dispel all doubts, it should be now stated unequivocally that the elements are not the same. That is implicit in the judgment of this Court in McCulloch v. Murray 8, so that it cannot be said that there was a course of judicial decision in the opposite sense.\nIn cases where claims are made for damages arising from ice or snow on a sidewalk where by virtue of statutory enactments a municipality is not to be liable except in the case of gross negligence, this Court has declined to lay down any rule defining that expression in any way except as great or very great negligence: Kingston v. Drennan 9; Holland v. Toronto 10, which contains merely a note of the decision, and 59 O.L.R. 628, where the reasons for judgment of this Court are printed. This Court has also declined to give a definition of gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct in a case arising under legislation in Nova Scotia similar to subsection 2 of s. 141 of the Saskatchewan Vehicles Act: McCulloch v. Murray supra. The same rule was followed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal under a statute referring only to gross negligence in Murdoch v. O'Sullivan 11, the decision in which was affirmed in this Court 12. In connection with the Saskatchewan statute, it is sufficient to say that gross negligence may be stated to be very great negligence, and it must be left to the trial judge in each case to put the matter to a jury in that way, with such references to the evidence as may be necessary.\nMr. Yule then contended that the two legs of the phrase mean the same thing but this Court has already held that that is not the proper construction by its approval in McCulloch v. Murray of the reasons for judgment of Sir Joseph Chisholm, speaking on behalf of the majority of the Court en banc in that case in (1941) 3 D.L.R. 42. The term \"wilful and wanton misconduct\" denotes something subjective on the part of the driver, whereas gross negligence may be found entirely apart from what the driver thought or intended. In such a case as this, the two alternatives should be put to the jury separately but for the reasons already given, it is now too late for the appellants to object that this was not done. I have not referred to the evidence because, on a review of it, it is impossible to say, as was contended on behalf of the appellants, that there was no evidence upon which the jury could find as it did, and it is also impossible to say that it was not a permissible view for the jury to take of the evidence that what it found to be gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct was not the former.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRand J.:\u2014I agree that the phrase \"gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct\" does not imply equivalence and is not to be identified in either sense with criminal negligence; and that the determination in any case of the condemned conduct is an ascertainment of fact for the jury in the light of the meaning of plain words of description. It is a matter of the degree to which, in the circumstances, conduct lies below the reasonable in attention to consequences; and the legislature has taken as the determinant the common judgment of men in the sense of the terms employed. In this I respectfully adopt the views of Duff C.J. in McCulloch v. Murray 13, expressed in his observations on the corresponding section of The Motor Vehicle Act of Nova Scotia.\nOn the other points, I agree that the appellant cannot succeed, and that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Estey and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nEstey J.:\u2014The respondent Frederick Cowper, on behalf of himself and his infant daughter Bernice Avis Cowper, as plaintiff brought this action against the appellants as driver and owner respectively of a Dodge Sedan in which Bernice Avis Cowper was riding when she suffered the injuries for which damages are here claimed.\nThe driver, Raymond N. Studer, had invited Bernice Avis Cowper to accompany him upon this occasion and there is no dispute that in order that damages may be recovered the plaintiff-respondent must prove that the injuries were caused by the \"gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct\" on the part of Raymond N. Studer in driving the Dodge Sedan automobile. S.S. 1945, c. 98, s. 141(2). This section reads as follows:\n141(2) The owner or driver of a motor vehicle, other than a vehicle ordinarily used for carrying passengers for hire or gain, shall not be liable for loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to or the death of any person being carried in or upon, or entering, or getting on to, or alighting from such motor vehicle, unless there has been gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct on the part of the driver of the vehicle and unless such gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct contributed to the injury.\nOn March 13, 1949, the appellant Raymond N. Studer, 21 or 22 years of age, with the plaintiff respondent Bernice Avis Cowper, about 16 years of age, drove south from the city of Saskatoon in a Dodge Sedan owned by the appellant Gerald L. Studer. The highway upon which they were driving passes over the main line of the Canadian National Railways where there are double tracks. They passed over this crossing at 2 a.m. and returned to the same crossing at 4 a.m. The country is rolling and about 100 yards south of the crossing, Raymond Studer, driving north, came over a rise in the ground from which there is a gradual slope toward the crossing in question. As he came over the rise he saw the switch lights east of the crossing and box cars at the crossing. The road was slippery, the snow being hard packed. He immediately applied his brakes and skidded 210 feet where he hit the last box car upon the train proceeding westward at the crossing on the north track at about 2 miles per hour. The impact was such that the front of the automobile was badly damaged and the infant respondent thrown forward in a manner that caused her head to go through the windshield. Raymond Studer said the automobile, because of the impact, \"bounced back.\" The evidence as to the speed of the automobile was most contradictory. Raymond Studer said he came over the rise at 35 miles per hour and was proceeding about 2 miles per hour when he struck the box car. The train was in the course of switching operations on the north track. The brakeman on the rear end had got off to adjust the switch when he heard the roar of an automobile and, looking up, could see it and estimated it to be 150 feet south. He thought it was coming at about 40 or 45 miles per hour. There was other evidence upon which the jury might have found that the automobile was proceeding at a much greater speed. The infant respondent was seriously and permanently injured.\nThe instructions of the learned trial judge with regard to negligence and gross negligence were so complete and thorough that no exceptions are taken thereto. In the course of his address the learned judge stated:\nNow we will give to you, when you go to the jury room, all the exhibits, and also copies of paragraph 6 of the statement of claim.\nThis was with the concurrence of counsel for all parties. Paragraph 6 reads as follows:\n6. The gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct on the part of the defendant Raymond N. Studer consisted of:\n(a) He knew, or should have known, that he was approaching the railway crossing referred to in Paragraph 4 hereof.\n(b) He was driving the said Dodge Sedan at a speed of sixty (60) miles an hour or more northward on said Lome Avenue Road as he approached said railway crossing at a time when the said road was, to his knowledge, covered with snow and\/or ice and unsafe for driving at such speed or at any speed in excess of twenty (20) miles an hour.\n(c) He knew, or should have known, that, at the speed at which he was travelling, he would not be able to bring the said Dodge Sedan to a stop in time to avoid a collision in the event that a train should come or be upon the said railway crossing.\n(d) He was \"showing off\" and seeking to impress the infant plaintiff with his reckless handling of the Dodge Sedan.\n(e) He failed to observe that a box freight car was on said railway crossing as he approached the said crossing.\n(f) He was keeping no proper or any look-out as he approached the; said railway crossing.\n(g) He was not giving due attention to the driving of the said Dodge Sedan at the said time.\n(h) He was driving the said Dodge Sedan with a reckless disregard of consequences.\nThe first question submitted to the jury read: \"Was there on the part of the defendant Raymond Studer gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct which caused the accident?\" The jury answered this question \"Yes\" and, therefore, as instructed, were required to state of what did such gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct consist, and as to this the learned trial judge instructed them as follows:\nBut if you find there was gross negligence, or wilful and wanton misconduct, then it is necessary to explain why you come to that conclusion. That is rather to give the reason on which that conclusion is based, to say what it consists of and that is where these particulars I will give you come into effect * * * If you can pick out any one, or a combination of them, or the whole of them, if you find they have been established\u2014my suggestion to you is, that if you come to the conclusion that if there has been gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct and you answer the first question in the affirmative, then you can look at these particulars and decide which of them are the cause of the negligence\u2014(a), (b), (c), (d) or whichever it is, of paragraph 6 of the statement of claim. You can put into there all of these items which you think have been proven, and leave out any you think have not been proven.\nThe jury selected sub-paragraphs (a), (c), (f) and (g) as the particulars of the gross negligence. I think, having regard to the foregoing instructions of the learned trial judge, particularly that sentence that the jury should \"leave out any you think have not been proven,\" it must be taken as contended by counsel for the appellant, quite apart from authority (Andreas v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. 14), that the jury negatived sub-paragraph (h) of the foregoing paragraph 6 to the effect that Studer was driving the automobile \"with a reckless disregard of consequences.\"\nThe jury assessed in favour of Frederick Cowper, in his own right, special damages in the sum of $1,492, and as next friend of Bernice Avis Cowper the sum of $17,500. The learned trial judge directed judgment accordingly and that judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe appellant submits that the jury, in not including sub-paragraph (h) in the particulars of gross negligence, negatived the allegation that Raymond Studer was driving \"with a reckless disregard of consequences\" and that being an essential of gross negligence, as that term has been construed in the foregoing s. 141(2), the judgment should be reversed. The appellant also contended that the foregoing construction has been adopted by the Legislature of Saskatchewan and, therefore, must be accepted in the courts.\nThe first case counsel for the appellant relies upon in support of his contention that the Court of Appeal in Saskatchewan has construed this section is Shortt v. Rush and British American Oil Company Limited15. It was there held an instruction to the jury \"that in order to hold the defendants liable they should find that the driver's conduct was intentional or on purpose\" was erroneous in law, but, though objectionable, it did not invalidate the verdict because, in an alternative charge, \"which engaged the ultimate attention of the jury,\" the learned judge, in reply to their inquiry as to what kind of indifference could be held to constitute gross negligence, emphasized this alternative by stating \"that in the circumstances the driver was careless of the consequences and 'took a chance.' \" In these circumstances the Court of Appeal held that, while \"the instructions of the learned trial judge to the jury were not altogether free from error, since no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had been occasioned in the trial on that account\" the appeal should be dismissed. In the course of the judgment the words \"gross negligence\" and \"wilful and wanton misconduct\" were discussed at some length and views expressed which, though unnecessary to the decision, are entitled to the greatest possible respect. At p. 199 it was stated:\nthat the term \"gross negligence\" in the enactment in question connotes criminal negligence which differs materially from civil negligence because objectively, it implies a want of care which may endanger human life while subjectively it implies a state of mind which is indifferent to consequences.\nIt follows that in order to substantiate his allegation that Rush was grossly negligent in his operation of the truck on the occasion in question it was incumbent on the plaintiff to satisfy the jury, (1) that he failed to take that care without which he knew or ought to have known that he might endanger the plaintiff's life; (2) that with such failure he exhibited a reckless disregard or indifference as to the consequences.\nIn the second case, Lloyd v. Milton and Derkson, 16, the court held that the facts established gross negligence within the statements made in Shortt v. Rush, supra. Upon the owner appealing to this court that conclusion was reversed 17.\nIn the third, Heck v. Braun and Marchuk, 18, it was held that the driver Braun was negligent \"but it was nothing more than inadvertence\" and not gross negligence within the meaning of the Vehicles Act 1935.\nThe charge approved of, in the first of these cases, the finding of fact in the second and that \"nothing more than inadvertence\" was established in the last, did not, with great respect, require that the phrase \"gross negligence\" be construed to connote \"criminal negligence\", nor neces- sarily to include the essentials numbered (1) and (2) in the first case, nor, as stated in the last, \"There must be conduct showing a reckless disregard, a complete indifference to the safety and rights of others.\"\nThe analyses made and the conclusions intimated by the learned judges are entitled to the greatest possible respect but, in the circumstances, do not constitute such a judicial construction of an enactment as to warrant the application of the common law rule that a re-enactment of words judicially construed discloses a legislative intention to adopt that construction. This is particularly true in the circumstances because of the modification of that rule enacted in Saskatchewan by s. 24(4) of the Saskatchewan Interpretation Act (S.S. 1943, c. 2, s. 24(4)).\nWhen, therefore, the Legislature in 1945 considered this section which it then rephrased and enacted as sec. 11 (S.S. 1943, c. 59, s. 11), which is now s. 141(2) above quoted, it cannot be said to have done more than to have appreciated the effect of the three foregoing decisions and left the phrases as enacted to be further construed in the courts.\nThe words \"gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct\" as enacted in s. 141(2) must be construed as if these phrases stood alone. Such was the view of the learned judges in Nova Scotia, where there is a similar statutory provision. Murray v. McCulloch 19. Their judgment was affirmed in this court 20, where Sir Lyman Duff C.J. stated at p. 145:\nI am, myself, unable to agree with the view that you may not have a case in which the jury could properly find the defendant guilty of gross negligence while refusing to find him guilty of wilful or wanton misconduct.\nThe Legislature, by the enactment of s. 141(2) above quoted, effected a change in the common law and, therefore, some assistance may be found in ascertaining the intent and purpose of this enactment by considering the position of such a passenger prior thereto. Before the adoption of this provision (s. 141(2)) such a passenger could recover from the driver or owner for any injuries suffered by reason of the driver's failure to use that care which a reasonable man would have exercised in the same or similar circumstances. Armand v. Carr 21. One who fails to use such care is negligent and what, in given circumstances, will constitute such failure is a question of fact.\nLord Wright, in Caswell v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Limited 22, stated:\nThe degree of want of care which constitutes negligence must vary with the circumstances. What that degree is, is a question for the jury or the Court in lieu of a jury. It is not a matter of uniform standard. It may vary according to the circumstances from man to man, from place to place, from time to time. It may vary even in the case of the same man.\nIn Read v. J. Lyons & Co. Ltd .23, Lord Macmillan stated:\nThe more dangerous the act the greater is the care that must be taken in performing it.\nThere are, therefore, varying degrees of care and the failure to exercise that degree of care required in the circumstances constitutes negligence. In this view, which would appear to have ultimately prevailed at common law, there are no degrees of negligence. Giblin v. Mc-Mullen 24; Moffatt v. Bateman 25; Beven\u2014Negligence, 4th Ed., at p. 25.\nThe term \"gross negligence\" appears often in statutory provisions and almost invariably it has been difficult to define its precise meaning. Indeed, Anglin C.J. in writing the judgment of this court in Holland v. City of Toronto 26, reported in full in 59 O.L.R. 628 at 631-37, in dealing with a statutory provision respecting the presence of snow and ice on sidewalks, stated:\nThe term \"gross negligence\" in this statute is not susceptible of definition.\nChief Justice Duff, in McCulloch v. Murray supra, pointed out, at p. 144, that he did not think it was\nany part of the duty of this Court, in applying the enactment before us, to define gross negligence, or to define wilful and wanton misconduct.\nHe did, however, recognize that learned judges at trial must instruct juries and did go on to state:\nAll these phrases, gross negligence, wilful misconduct, wanton misconduct, imply conduct in which, if there is not conscious wrong doing, there is a very marked departure from the standards by which responsible and competent people in charge of motor cars habitually govern themselves. The Legislature of Saskatchewan, while it relieved the driver and owner from the common law liability when the driver's conduct constitutes negligence, by the enactment of sec. 141(2) intended that these parties should remain liable for the driver's gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct. There is no reason to conclude that the Legislature intended there should be any hiatus between negligence and gross negligence and, therefore, whenever the conduct of the driver, in the opinion of the jury, was in excess of negligence it would be gross negligence within the meaning of sec. 141(2). Then, by the inclusion of the words \"or wilful and wanton misconduct\" after the words \"gross negligence\" the Legislature has evidenced an intention to include that conduct more reprehensible than gross negligence and for this also the above-named parties should remain liable to a passenger within the meaning of that section. Whether conduct should be classified as \"negligence,\" \"gross negligence,\" or \"wilful and wanton misconduct,\" is a question of fact to be determined in the circumstances of each case. It may well be, as evidenced by the authorities above quoted, that what in one circumstance may be negligence may, in another, be gross negligence, or vice versa. It cannot, however, be said that a jury must find in every case that the driver's conduct amounts to a reckless disregard of consequences before they \u00aban find that conduct constitutes gross negligence.\nA reading of the learned judge's charge, to which no exception was taken, makes it abundantly clear that there could be no doubt in the jury's mind but that it was their duty to consider whether the conduct of the accused constituted negligence and, if so, could it properly be described as gross negligence. The jury found that the conduct of the driver constituted gross negligence and there is abundant evidence to support that finding. In addition to the general verdict of gross negligence, the jury were asked to give particulars thereof, not in their own language, as already stated, but by the selection of \"any one, or a combination of them, or the whole of them,\" from subparagraphs (a) to (h) inclusive above quoted. These were all pleaded as particulars of gross negligence and neither prior to nor throughout the trial was there any objection to them as such. The learned judge told the jury, and no exception was taken thereto, in express terms or language from which they would necessarily conclude that if these respective sub-paragraphs or any of them were proved such would constitute gross negligence.\nIt was in these circumstances that the jury selected subparagraphs (a), (c), (f) and (g) to indicate what they, upon the evidence, regarded as gross negligence. These particulars as found must be read and construed in relation to the pleadings, the evidence and the charge of the learned trial judge.\nIn British Columbia Electric Railway Co. v. Dunphy 27, the jury found negligence causing the accident on the part of the defendant and, as particulars thereof, stated \"insufficient precaution on account of approaching crossing and conditions on morning in question.\" It was contended they did not, in effect, specify the negligence. Mr. Justice Anglin (later C.J.) stated at p. 271:\nMeticulous criticisms of a jury's findings are not admissible and they must always be read with and construed in the light of the issues presented by the pleadings, the evidence and the charge of the trial judge.\nMr. Justice Anglin went on to state that while the particulars might have been more specifically stated, it did appear that the meaning of the jury was \"suffiiciently certain.\" Mr. Justice Duff, (later C.J.) stated that, when read with the charge, the particulars became \"perfectly intelligible.\"\nIn Pronek v. Winnipeg, Selkirk and Lake Winnipeg Railway Company (2) 28, Lord Wright stated:\nBut the language of a jury in explaining the reasons for their verdict ought not to be construed too narrowly.\nJamieson v. Harris 29, emphasized by the appellant, is distinguishable from the case at bar. There death was caused during the construction of bins in an elevator by the falling of a plank. Though many of the 26 questions submitted to the jury were answered, they did not, upon any reasonable construction, include a finding that the falling of the plank was due to negligence on the part of the appellant (defendant). Moreover, the one question specifically asking such was not answered and, therefore, the essential fact that the negligence of the defendant caused the injury for which damage was asked was not proved.\nMoreover, the remarks of Mr. Justice Anglin, in Wabash Railway Co. v. Follick30, where the finding of the jury was described as vague, are pertinent to the position in this case. At p. 384 he stated:\nNo objection to the findings seems to have been made when they were brought in. If counsel were not satisfied that they were sufficient and responsive to the questions submitted they might have called the attention of the trial judge to the matter and he might have directed the jury to bring in a more specific finding.\nThe language of these particulars, when read and construed in the light of the pleadings, evidence and charge, constitutes particulars of gross negligence.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nLocke J.:\u2014It is unfortunate that, when it was decided by a number of the Provincial Legislatures in Canada that the liability of the driver of a motor vehicle to a passenger carried gratuitously should be restricted to cases where the negligence complained of was of a different character to that which had before been sufficient, some more definite term than gross negligence was not adopted. The meaning to be assigned to the expression has been a matter of discussion and disagreement in the courts since, in referring to the liability of one type of bailee, Holt C.J. in Coggs v. Bernard 31, said that he was only liable for some gross neglect.\nBy an amendment to the Consolidated Municipal Act 1892, enacted by the Ontario Legislature in 1894 (s. 13, c. 50), the liability of a municipal corporation for accidents to persons falling, owing to snow or ice upon sidewalks, was restricted to cases where there was gross negligence by the corporation, and the meaning to be assigned to the term was considered by this Court in City of Kingston v. Dren-nan 32. Sedgewicke J. in delivering the opinion of the majority of the Court, after saying that he was not bold enough to enter upon a detailed investigation as to the difference between gross and other kinds of negligence, said that (p. 60):\nWe must, I suppose, give some meaning to this expression of the legislative will and the meaning I give to it is \"very great negligence.\"\nIn German v. City of Ottawa 33, Anglin J. with whom Davies J. agreed, referred to and adopted the statement of Sedgewick J. in Drennan's case, and in Holland v. City of Toronto 34, 35, Anglin C.J.C. again referring to the matter said (p. 634):\nThe term \"gross negligence\" in this statute is not susceptible of definition. No \u00e0 priori standard can be set up for determining when negligence should be deemed \"very great negligence,\" a paraphrase suggested in Drennan v. City of Kingston 36, which, for lack of anything better, has been generally accepted.\nThe amendment to the Saskatchewan Vehicles Act, 1935 (c. 68) was made to introduce the expression to be considered in this appeal. The words \"gross negligence\" appear in conjunction with the words \"wilful and wanton misconduct\", so that in a case such as this the driver of the vehicle is only liable if there has been gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct on his part. When the legislation was first considered by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Shortt v. Rush 37, Mackenzie J.A. (p. 199) while referring to what had been said by Sedgewick J. as to the expression \"gross negligence\" came to the conclusion that, by reason of its association with the term \"wilful and wanton misconduct\", a different meaning was to be assigned to it and that it connoted criminal negligence and, accordingly, it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to satisfy the jury that the defendant had failed to take that care without which he knew or ought to have known that he might endanger the plaintiff's life, and that with such failure he exhibited a reckless disregard or indifference as to the consequences. This interpretation was adopted ' by that court in Lloyd v. Milton 38, and again in Heck v. Braun 39. These decisions cannot, in my opinion, be reconciled with the judgment of this Court in McCulloch v. Murray 40. The words \"gross negligence\" or \"wilful and wanton misconduct\" are not to be interpreted as if they read \"gross negligence and wilful and wanton misconduct.\" While the trial judge in charging the jury in that case had, in endeavouring to assist the jury to appreciate the meaning to be assigned to the expression \"gross negligence\", said that the adjective that most fittingly described such conduct was the word \"reckless\", there was no suggestion made to the jury that it was necessary to prove fault which could be properly characterized as criminal negligence. Nor do I think that the judgment of Sir Joseph Chisholm C.J. on the appeal is to be construed as adopting the expression \"reckless conduct\" as synonymous with \"gross negligence\", but as saying merely that reckless conduct may in some circumstances properly be described as gross negligence. I think the language there used by the learned Chief Justice, which was approved and adopted by Sir Lyman Duff, was not intended to express a view differing from that of Sedgewick J. in Drennan's case.\nThe reference in the judgment of Taschereau J. who delivered the judgment of the majority of the Court to the views of a properly instructed jury obviously proceeded upon the footing that the charge to the jury, when read as a whole, did not depart from that statement of the law. The learned Chief Justice of this Court in turn declined to attempt to define \"gross negligence\" and expressed the view that it was undesirable that the Court should attempt to replace by paraphrases the language which the Legislature had chosen to express its meaning. With great respect, I think it was error in Shortt's case to construe the expression \"gross negligence\" in any other manner than as indicated by the judgment of this Court in Drennan's case. It cannot be said that this leaves the matter in a satisfactory state but, unless and until the meaning of the expression is clarified by legislation, the courts administering justice must, in my opinion, treat the question to be decided, whether by a judge or a jury, as whether or not there has been very great negligence in the circumstances of the particular case. In the present matter there was, in my opinion, evidence to go to the jury upon that issue and I respectfully agree with Mr. Justice Gordon that the answers made are properly to be construed as finding gross negligence.\nMr. Yule, in his able argument for the appellant, contended further that since the Saskatchewan Legislature had re-enacted the amended section 85 of The Vehicles Act, 1935, after the decision of the Court of Appeal in Shortt v. Rush, in The Vehicles Act, 1939, and in the Revised Statutes of 1940, it should be held that it had adopted the interpretation of the expression \"gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct\" propounded in that case. The principle upon which the argument is based is stated by the Earl of Halsbury in Webb v. Outrim 41, as being that when a particular form of legislative enactment which has received authoritative interpretation, whether by judicial decision or by a long course of practice, is adopted in the framing of a later statute, it is a sound principle of construction to hold that the words were intended by the Legislature to bear the meaning which has been so put upon them. In Barras v. Aberdeen Steam Trawling and Fishing Company 42, in an appeal in a Scottish case, Viscount Buckmaster followed this statement of the law, and in MacMillan v. Brownlee 43, Sir Lyman Duff relied upon the principle as stated by Lord Buckmaster in construing a section in a statute of the Province of Alberta. Section 48 of the Interpretation Act (c. 1, R.S.S. 1940) provides that:\nThe Legislature shall not, by re-enacting an Act or part of an Act or by revising, consolidating or amending the same, be deemed to have adopted the construction which has by judicial decisions or otherwise been placed upon the language used in such Act or upon similar language.\nA similar provision contained in subsection 4 of section 21 of The Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 1, is referred to in the judgment of Anglin J. in Canadian Pacific Railway v. Albin 44. In that case a section of the Consolidated Railway Act of 1903 was re-enacted after it had been interpreted in a number of decisions in Ontario and Anglin J. adopted the language of Lord Watson in Casgrain v. Atlantic & North West Railway Co. 45, reading:\nTheir Lordships cannot assume that the Dominion Legislature, when they adopted the clause verbatim in the year 1888, were in ignorance of the judicial interpretation which it had received. It must, on the contrary, be assumed that they understood that sect. 12 of the Canadian Act must have been acted upon in the light of that interpretation. In these circumstances their Lordships, even if they had entertained doubts as to the meaning of sect. 12 of the Act of 1888, would have declined to disturb the construction of its language which had been judicially affirmed.\nIn the present matter, however, after the decision of this Court in McCulloch v. Murray in 1942, the Legislature has by s. 11 of c. 59 of the Statutes of 1943 repealed s. 140 of The Vehicles Act, R.S.C. 1940, c. 275, and re-enacted it in rather different terms but again used the terms in question \"gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct\", and by c. 98 of the Statutes of 1945 repealed The Vehicles Act of 1939 and re-enacted as s. 141 the section as amended in 1943. In my opinion, if in spite of the language of s. 48 of The Interpretation Act there is any presumption that the Legislature intended to adopt the interpretation which had been placed upon the expression in judgments of the courts, when the amendment of 1943 was made and when subsequently the section was re-enacted, the presumption is that the interpretation assigned to the similar language of the Nova Scotia statute by this Court was adopted.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Makaroff, Carter & Carter.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Hall, Maguire & Wedge\n1 [1950] 1 W.W.R. 780.\n2 [1937] 2 W.W.R. 191.\n3 [1937] 3 W.W.R. 504.\n4 [1938] 2 W.W.R. 1.\n5 (1919) 59 Can.

Limited Of Canada (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nDame Lena Moore (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1950: October 30, 31, November 1; 1951: February 26.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau, Estey, Locke and Cartwright JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nDamage\u2014Negligence\u2014Bottle of liquid dropped on floor of store by customer\u2014Second customer slipped and fell\u2014Fall of bottle witnessed by clerk who advised caretaker but did not warn customers\u2014Whether store liable\u2014Whether warning within functions of clerk\u2014Art. 1053, 1064 C.C.\nThe respondent, a customer in appellant's large departmental store in Montreal, fell on the floor after slipping on a patch of liquid substance which had been in a bottle accidentally dropped by another customer. The fall of the bottle was witnessed by a sales clerk in charge of the clock counter and engaged at the time in serving a client. The clerk immediately telephoned the caretaking department and then resumed his sale. Within three minutes of the phone call a caretaker was on the spot, but in the interval the accident had happened. The dismissal of the action by the trial judge was reversed by a majority in, the Court of Appeal.\nHeld (Estey and Cartwright JJ. dissenting), that it was not the clerk's duty in the performance of the work for which he was employed to do more than what he did, and therefore the store was not liable under 1054 of the Civil Code. (Curley v. Latreille and Moreau v. Labette applied).\nHeld also, (Estey and Cartwright JJ. dissenting), that no positive fault could be attributed to the store since it had fully provided for an elaborate and efficacious system to meet such emergencies.\nPer Estey and Cartwright JJ. (dissenting): It was the clerk's duty during the short interval that he knew must elapse before the arrival of the caretaker to warn customers of the danger actually known to him and his failure to do so rendered the store responsible; but if, whether by reason of express instructions or the lack of instructions, this duty did not rest on the clerk, then the store was directly liable for its negligence in failing to provide for the warning of its customers during such interval.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, maintaining, McDougall J.A. dissenting, the action of the customer of a large departmental store who injured herself when she fell on the floor of the store.\nW. B. Scott K.C. and P. M. Laing for the appellant.\nF. P. Brais K.C. and A. J. Campbell K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014The appellant owns and operates a large departmental store in Montreal. The building consists of ten floors with a total floor area open to the public of 646,380 square feet. In the operation of the store the appellant employs between 2,500 and 3,000 persons.\nAt about 11.00 a.m. on the morning of the 16th November, 1942, a store count disclosed that there were 1,283 members of the public in the premises. The number would be slightly larger around noon when the accident hereinafter mentioned happened.\nAmongst the customers was the respondent, a nurse employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, aged s6. She had come to the store to make some purchases and was walking on the ground floor, to leave by the St. Catherine and University Streets exit. She slipped and fell, thereby incurring injuries for which she claims compensation from the appellant. The cause of her fall was that she slipped on a patch of liquid substance of sticky appearance about six inches in diameter which was on the floor some twenty feet from the exit. The respondent described it as lotion and said it was very slippery. The presence of this substance was explained by the fact that half a minute, or a minute before the respondent fell, an unidentified woman, evidently a customer, had dropped a small bottle which broke on hitting the floor. The customer \"merely turned around and looked at it and then scampered off on her way.\"\nBy pure chance the dropping of this bottle was noticed by Frank Bertrand, a sales clerk employed in the clock department of the appellant, and who was at the time actively engaged with a customer in selling clocks at his counter. He immediately picked up the house telephone and advised the caretaking department. The caretaking department signalled to O'Doherty, one of its staff, who was on the ground floor, by means of its system of signal lights and gongs installed throughout the store. He at once called the caretaking department by the house telephone and was instructed to go to the University and St. Catherine Streets exit. He took one minute to get there, arriving in about three minutes after Bertrand had put in his telephone call, but in the interval the accident had happened.\nThe respondent said both feet slipped from under her and she came down on the floor\u2014no doubt heavily, because she was of unusual build, being five feet four inches in height and 220 pounds in weight.\nFollowing the accident the appellant provided first aid and other treatment for the respondent. While she did not have to be hospitalized she was, however, unable to resume her duties and she was superannuated at the age of 57. This resulted in the reduction of her retirement pension to $747.50 per annum instead of the larger sum she would have received had she been able to continue her work to retirement age.\nThe learned trial Judge (Loranger J.) dismissed the action. The Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) 2 reversed that judgment and assessed the total damages at $10,000. Counsel for the appellant stated that he raised no objection to this finding as to quantum and that the appeal was solely directed against the finding of the majority of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) that the appellant was responsible for this unfortunate accident. Errol McDougall J. dissented in the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side).\nAs stated by this Court in Canadian National Railways Co. v. Lepage 3:\nIt is a familiar principle that neglect may, in law, be considered a fault only if it corresponds with a duty to act.\nThe learned trial judge found as a fact that\nIl n'y a aucune preuve de faute par omission,, n\u00e9gligence ou incurie de la part de la d\u00e9fenderesse.\nMoreover, even if the duty to act is shown, that duty exists only if the accident is foreseeable and, in turn, it must be foreseeable by a man of ordinary and reasonable prudence. (Ouellet v. Cloutier 4; L'Oeuvre des Terrains de Jeux de Qu\u00e9bec v. Cannon 5 per Rivard J.). It is absolutely certain that, upon the record, no positive fault resulting from negligence, or lack of foresight, could be imputed to the appellant. In the Court of King's Bench it was thought the latter could be held responsible on the ground of what they called abstention fautive by one judge, or connaissance retard\u00e9e by another judge. But, if there had been omission, which would make the appellant liable, it can only be said that Bertrand did not desist from the selling of clocks, in which he was engaged at the time, and go out into the aisle and prevent the respondent from slipping on the substance on the floor. As for the connaissance retard\u00e9e of the employer, it is proven, as found by the learned trial judge, that immediately the bottle of liquid fell upon the floor a signal was given to the care-taking department to come and take care of it, and the employees of that department answered the signal within a few moments, but the accident had already happened. As a matter of fact, upon the evidence, the respondent fell on the liquid any where between one-half a minute, or a minute, after the bottle had been dropped.\nThe learned trial judge treated the mishap as a pure accident resulting from the act of a third party, over whom the appellant had no control whatever. There were several obstacles in the way of the success of the respondent. First, the company itself cannot be saddled with any neglect in the matter. It had provided a complete and elaborate system of cleaning the floors under just some such circumstance.\nSecondly, it had to be shown that Bertrand, upon whose alleged negligence the respondent relied for the maintenance of her claim, if he had himself attended to the cleaning of the patch of oil, would have been acting \"in the performance of the work for which he was employed\" (C.C., Article 1054). He did not belong to the caretaking department, whose duty it was to clean the floor. He was the clerk in charge of the clock counter. It was no part of his work to attend to the cleaning up of this small patch of liquid on the floor, and it was so found by the learned trial judge, who stated:\nIl n'avait rien \u00e0 faire avec l'entretien des planchers.\nIn this case the learned trial judge rightly held that if any negligence can be attributed to Bertrand, at all events it was not in the performance of his work for the appellant.\nThirdly, as pointed out by McDougall J.:\u2014\nThe time elapsed between the breaking of the bottle of lotion on the floor and the accident was so short as to militate strongly against the theory of negligence with which appellant was charged.\n* * *\nThe two acts, fall and break of bottle and the fall of the respondent, were so closely related in time as to extrude or negative the factor of negligence \u2026\n* * *\nNo such immediate apprehension of danger could dictate any greater precautions at that time.\nThe patch of liquid on the floor was described as being about the diameter of one of the witnesses hands. It was not inherently dangerous; it did not constitute a concealed danger, but was visible and did not necessarily indicate the imminence or probability of an accident. Even if it had been Bertrand's duty to provide against the eventuality, such eventuality was unforeseeable.\nAgain quoting McDougall J.:\u2014\nIt is, in my view, unreasonable to contend that the precaution must be instantaneous with the event causative of the accident. Time must elapse to transform what is normally a pure accident into actionable fault.\nReduced to its simplest form and in its present connotation, the test of negligence is hot whether greater precautions might have been taken and the loss avoided, but whether ordinary precautions, those usual in the circumstances, were taken.\nHere, the finding of fact in the Superior Court on that point was that the accident happened suddenly and almost at the same time as it was discovered that the liquid had spilled on the floor, and the orders to clean it up were given without delay.\nIn order to come to the conclusion that the appellant could be held responsible in the premises the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) referred to extracts from the works of commentators of the Civil Code. One of them puts it on what he calls devoir moral, thus apparently assimilating the moral duty to the legal duty; but, of course, that is not the law of the Province of Quebec. Another writer states that the responsibility must be placed on those who can more easily sustain the loss, and again that is not the law of the Province of Quebec.\nThe proposition that the knowledge of imminence of danger might constitute a fault entailing responsibility if one neglects, or abstains, from acting, could hold only if there was the time and the means of preventing it, but, in this case, that is precisely what cannot be sustained on the facts as they were held, upon ample evidence, by the learned trial judge.\nIn addition to what is said above on that point, there are two considerations which must be taken into account. I cannot agree with the proposition that Bertrand, consistently with his duties towards his employer, should have immediately proceeded to the spot where the liquid had been spilt on the floor and leave on the counter, within the reach of a customer whom he did not know, valuable articles which he was then showing, with the risk that, during his absence, these articles might disappear. It was, in my mind, his paramount duty to remain, or at least, before doing anything else, to replace the articles on the shelves. In such a case, the very time required for doing so would have prevented him from arriving soon enough to bring any remedy in the circumstances.\nMoreover, even the man in charge of the cleaning department, when he reached the so-called dangerous spot, found that he was not in a position to immediately make the cleaning. He had to provide for it temporarily by placing a piece of cardboard on the oily substance. It is not shown that Bertrand knew of the existence of this cardboard in the vicinity of the store where the cleaner took it.\nThe crux of the matter is that, in a given case, nobody can be found negligent for having failed to foresee absolutely every possible kind of happening. The law does not require more of any man than that he should have acted in a reasonable way.\nAs to the attempt to hold the company itself responsible, it was said that, if it cannot be attributed to anything that formed part of Bertrand's duty and the employer cannot be found liable on that account, there was failure on the part of the appellant to have instructed Bertrand, and presumably all other employees in the store, that when they saw something of this nature drop, which might be dangerous, they were to take immediate steps to protect customers from injury, which, in effect, is a contention that there was a negligent system. We have not in the Province of Quebec the distinction between the duty of the occupier towards an invitee and towards a licensee as illustrated by Willes, J. in Indermaur v. Dames 6, and where the latter judge says that the occupier is expected to \"use reasonable care to prevent damage from unusual danger, which he knows or ought to know.\"\nIt is also expressed in slightly different language by Lord Hailsham, L.C., in Addie v. Dumbreck 7, that to those \"who are present by the invitation of the occupier \u2026\", the latter \"has the duty of taking reasonable care that the premises are safe,\" which is resumed in Salmond on Torts, 10th Ed., at p. 280, that the duty is Usually stated as \"to take care to make the premises reasonably safe.\"\nThat statement, however, to my mind, expresses the utmost duty which an occupier owes to a customer under the law of the Province of Quebec. Nothing requires him to do anything beyond that; and he could not be held negligent for having failed to provide against any eventuality however impossible to imagine.\nOne can but speculate how far the suggested duty of the occupier is to be carried. Can it be held that the operator of a department or chain store should be required to instruct all of his employees that, if they see someone drop something over which customers may stumble or upon which they may slip, they are at once to take steps to warn people of the danger\u2014and, in the present case, not a certain danger? And, if so, does it apply to clerks working at nearby counters, truckers employed in bringing goods into the store and to all employees who may see the occurrence or its results? The evidence is clear that the liquid was colourless, so that it would have been impossible for Bertrand to know that the contents were oily; though he undoubtedly learned that when he took up the injured woman. If the liquid was not oily, it might be no more dangerous than if water was present on the floor. Are the employees to take prompt steps to protect customers, even though what has been dropped does not appear to them to be dangerous, or are they to be required to immediately take steps to prevent anybody stumbling or falling upon anything that has been dropped?\nThe trial judge did not consider that there was any. negligence on the part of the Eaton Company, so that obviously he considered the precautions they had taken, by maintaining the caretaking department and the system of signalling when there was a mishap, reasonable precautions by the employer. I cannot bring myself to think that this finding of fact should be disturbed and that the contrary view should prevail. The extent of the duty of the employer should not be carried further.\nIn the premises, I wish to express my complete agreement with what was stated by McDougall J. in the extracts which I have quoted above. Whichever view is taken of the special circumstances in which the accident happened, I would say that the element of time is here decisive against the admission of the Respondent's claim against the Appellant.\nIn the case of The Governor and Company of Gentlemen Adventurers of England v. Vaillancourt 8, both Duff J. (as he then was) and Mignault J. drew attention to the fact that the doctrine of the moral duty or that the negligence should fall upon the proprietor because he enjoys the profits arising from his enterprise are considerations which may have found favour among the legal writers in France, but they stated they did not think that considerations derived from this mode of reasoning can legitimately be applied in controlling the interpretation or the application of the text under discussion (to wit C.C. Article 1054).\nFor the several reasons enumerated; because no positive fault can be attributed to the company itself; because it had fully provided for an elaborate and sufficient system to meet such emergencies; because it was not Bertrand's duty in the performance of the work for which he was employed to look after the cleaning of the floor (Moreau v. Labelle 9; Curley v. Latreille 10; because even assuming that Bertrand had a moral duty, which is not admitted, such duty cannot be assimilated to legal duty towards the respondent; because the time elapsed between the breaking of the bottle and the accident was so short that, even granting the existence of a legal duty, there cannot be negligence on Bertrand's part; because the theory of the modern French writers does not form part of the law of the Province of Quebec (The Governor, etc. v. Vaillancourt supra), the appeal should be allowed with costs both here and in the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side), and the judgment of the Superior Court restored.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Locke JJ. was delivered by Taschereau, J.:\u2014Pour r\u00e9ussir dans la pr\u00e9sente action, la demanderesse-intim\u00e9e devait n\u00e9cessairement \u00e9tablir qu'il appartenait \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 Bertrand de la prot\u00e9ger contre l'accident dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la victime, ou alternativement, que l'appelante n'a pas pris les pr\u00e9cautions n\u00e9cessaires pour emp\u00eacher les dommages qu'elle a subis.\nBertrand, un commis vendeur au rayon des horloges, pr\u00e8s de l'endroit o\u00f9 l'accident est survenu, a bien vu une bouteille, qu'une tierce personne venait d'acheter, tomber sur le plancher du magasin \u00e0 rayons dont l'appelante est propri\u00e9taire, et r\u00e9alisant qu'un accident pouvait arriver, avertit aussit\u00f4t les autorit\u00e9s, et demanda qu'on envoie quelqu'un pour enlever ce liquide huileux. Environ une minute plus tard, l'intim\u00e9e qui se dirigeait vers la sortie de la rue Universit\u00e9, glissa sur cette flaque d'huile et fut s\u00e9rieusement bless\u00e9e. Deux minutes apr\u00e8s, un nettoyeur pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 cette fin couvrit cette flaque d'huile d'un carton plac\u00e9 derri\u00e8re le comptoir voisin, et s'en retourna chercher les instruments n\u00e9cessaires pour nettoyer le plancher.\nC'est la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9e que Bertrand a commis une faute d'omission, qui engage la responsabilit\u00e9 de son employeur, en n\u00e9gligeant d'alerter les clients du danger que pr\u00e9sentait cette flaque d'huile glissante. Il est certain que la faute d'omission peut engendrer la responsabilit\u00e9, mais il faut que la n\u00e9gligence d'agir corresponde \u00e0 un devoir d'agir (C.N.R. v. Lepage 11). Ce devoir cependant doit \u00eatre bas\u00e9 sur une obligation l\u00e9gale, et ne doit pas reposer uniquement sur l'altruisme ou le' d\u00e9vouement, que souvent la charit\u00e9 commande envers le prochain. (Colin et Capitant, Droit Civil, Fran\u00e7ais, 10\u00e8me Ed., p. 221). N\u00e9gliger de prendre les pr\u00e9cautions requises que prendrait un homme prudent, qui a l'obligation d'agir dans des conditions identiques, constituerait cette faute d'omission. Mais pour que le ma\u00eetre soit responsable de l'omission de son serviteur, il y a deux conditions imperatives qui sont requises. Il faut que le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 ait commis une faute, et il faut qu'il l'ait commise dans l'exercice de ses fonctions. (Code Civil, 1054) (Colin et Capitant, supra, page 257).\nLa premi\u00e8re de ces propositions est \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire. Le d\u00e9lit ou le quasi-d\u00e9lit du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 est \u00e9videmment une condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 que la loi impose au ma\u00eetre, et comme cons\u00e9quence de ce principe, il r\u00e9sulte que le ma\u00eetre ou le commettant, a un recours contre son employ\u00e9 coupable qui est l'auteur du fait dommageable, et qu'\u00e9videmment, la victime elle-m\u00eame, peut r\u00e9clamer de l'employ\u00e9 les dommages qu'elle a subis. (Colin et Capitant, supra, \u00e0 la page 257). Comme le disent Planiol et Ripert, (Droit Civil, \"Les Obligations\" Vol. 1, page 883, No. 652).\nPour que le commettant soit responsable, il faut non seulement que l'acte soit illicite mais encore que le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 soit responsable personnellement du dommage qu'il cause.\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 de l'employ\u00e9 est d\u00e9lictuelle, celle du ma\u00eetre repose sur la loi, deux sources diff\u00e9rentes d'obligations (C.C. 983).\nEn second lieu, il faut que l'employ\u00e9 ait commis le fait dommageable dans l'exercice des fonctions auxquelles il est employ\u00e9. Comme le dit Mazaud, Vol. 1, \"Responsabilit\u00e9 Civile,\" 4\u00e8me Ed., \u00e0 la page 835:\nSi l'on consulte les travaux pr\u00e9paratoires du Code Civil, l'h\u00e9sitation n'est pas permise; D\u00e8s que le dommage a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 non plus \"dans l'exercice des fonctions\" mais seulement \"\u00e0 l'occasion des fonctions,\" le commettant ne doit pas \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 responsable. On ne peut en effet faire reposer la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre sur le fait que l'omission ou l'acte fautif se serait produit dans le temps et le lieu du service. Il faut n\u00e9cessairement un rapport entre la faute et la fonction du service, un lien qui rattache la faute \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du mandat confi\u00e9 au pr\u00e9pos\u00e9. (Mazaud, Vol. 1, 4\u00e8me Ed., page 839).\nLe commettant r\u00e9pond donc des actes fautifs que le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 a commis pour atteindre le but de ses fonctions, m\u00eame si les actes sont le fruit d'un abus des fonctions pour lesquelles il est employ\u00e9. (Savatier, \"Trait\u00e9 de la Responsabilit\u00e9 Civile,\" Vol. 1, page 427) (Colin et Capitant, Vol. 2, 10\u00e8me Ed., page 258). Dans le cas contraire, le commettant n'encourra aucune responsabilit\u00e9. C'est la doctrine accept\u00e9e non seulement par les auteurs, mais \u00e9galement par cette Cour dans The Governor and Company of Gentlemen Adventurers of England v. Vaillancourt 12, o\u00f9 Sir Lyman Duff dit ce qui suit:\nLe fait dommageable must be something done in the execution of the servant's functions as servant or in the performance of his work as servant. If the thing done belongs to the kind of work which the servant is employed to perform or the class of things falling within l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions, then by the plain words of the text responsibility rests upon the employer. Whether that is so or not in a particular case must, I think, always be in substance a question of fact, and although in cases lying near the borderline decisions on analogous states of fact may be valuable as illustrations, it is not, I think, the rule itself being clear, a proper use of authority to refer to such decisions for the purpose of narrowing or enlarging the limits of the rule.\nDe plus, dans Curley v. Latreille13, M. le Juge Mignault \u00e0 la page 175, s'exprime dans les termes suivants:\nEtant donn\u00e9 que l'interpr\u00e9tation stricte s'impose en cette mati\u00e8re, je ne puis me convaincre que le texte de notre article nous autorise \u00e0 accueillir toutes les solutions que je viens d'indiquer. Ainsi, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, le ma\u00eetre et le commettant sont responsables du dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques et ouvriers dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles ces derniers sont employ\u00e9s, ou, pour citer la version anglaise de l'article 1054 C.C., in the performance of the work for which they are employed. Ceci me para\u00eet clairement exclure la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre pour un fait accompli par le domestique ou ouvrier \u00e0 l'occasion seulement de ses fonctions, si on ne peut dire que ce fait s'est produit dans l'ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions. Il peut souvent \u00eatre difficile de d\u00e9terminer si le fait dommageable est accompli dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions ou seulement \u00e0 leur occasion, mais s'il appert r\u00e9ellement que ce fait n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accompli dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions du domestique ou ouvrier, nous nous trouvons en dehors de notre texte. Enfin, dans Moreau v. Labelle 14, M. le Juge Rinfret dit ce qui suit:\nIls font sentir d'une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s nette l'erreur qui assimilerait au d\u00e9lit commis dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 le d\u00e9lit commis pendant le temps de ces fonctions.\nBertrand, par faute, n\u00e9gligence ou inhabilet\u00e9, a-t-il commis un quasi-d\u00e9lit qui le rendrait personnellement responsable sous l'empire de l'article 1053 C.C., et qui en cons\u00e9quence, obligerait l'appelante en vertu de 1054 C.C.? S'il a commis une faute d'omission en n\u00e9gligeant de pr\u00e9venir l'intim\u00e9e d'un danger imminent, \u00e9tait-ce au cours de l'exercice des fonctions auxquelles il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9?\nAvec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je dois r\u00e9pondre dans la n\u00e9gative \u00e0 ces deux questions. Bertrand, pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au comptoir de la vente des horloges, n'avait pas l'obligation l\u00e9gale d'avertir l'intim\u00e9e qu'une tierce personne, en quittant le magasin, avait \u00e9chapp\u00e9 cette bouteille d'huile graisseuse. L'ex\u00e9cution du mandat qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 n'avait aucune relation avec la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des clients, et je ne vois pas comment on pourrait lui imputer une faute par suite d'une omission, alors que ni la loi ni les termes de son emploi ne l'obligeaient \u00e0 agir. Je ne doute pas du sort qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 reserv\u00e9 \u00e0 une action intent\u00e9e contre Bertrand, ou aux autres vendeurs, t\u00e9moins de l'accident, pour leur r\u00e9clamer personnellement des dommages \u00e0 cause de cette pr\u00e9tendue omission. C'est avec raison, \u00e9videmment, qu'ils auraient r\u00e9pondu que cette action ne repose sur aucun fondement juridique, vu qu'ils n'avaient aucun devoir vis-\u00e0-vis l'intim\u00e9e. Et pourtant, cette responsabilit\u00e9 quasi-d\u00e9lic-tuelle de Bertrand est essentielle \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale de l'appelante. Ce serait exprimer des vues contraires \u00e0 celles des auteurs et de la jurisprudence que j'ai cit\u00e9s, que d'\u00e9tendre la port\u00e9e de l'article 1054, et de lui faire dire que \"l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions\" de Bertrand, comprend dans le cas qui nous occupe, non seulement la vente des horloges, mais \u00e9galement la surveillance de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des clients.\nL'intim\u00e9e a soumis comme alternative que si Bertrand n'a pas commis de faute, la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'appelante est tout de m\u00eame engag\u00e9e comme r\u00e9sultat de sa n\u00e9gligence \u00e0 prendre les soins raisonnables et les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour pr\u00e9venir les accidents de ce genre. La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que l'appelante a organis\u00e9 dans son immeuble un syst\u00e8me \u00e9labor\u00e9 de nettoyage pour pr\u00e9voir les \u00e9ventualit\u00e9s telles que celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause de l'accident dans le pr\u00e9sent litige. Ce syst\u00e8me a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu comme efficace par le juge au proc\u00e8s, et sur ce point, je m'accorde avec lui. Mais, \u00e9videmment, il est impossible de pr\u00e9voir tous les accidents et de les pr\u00e9venir. Il y aura toujours des accidents dommageables, qui cependant n'engendreront la responsabilit\u00e9 de personne. La loi demande que le propri\u00e9taire d'un immeuble agisse avec une prudence raisonnable. Ainsi, dans L'\u00e6uvre des Terrains de Jeux de Qu\u00e9bec v. Cannon 15, M. le Juge Rivard s'exprime de la fa\u00e7on suivante \u00e0 la page 114:\nLe plus s\u00fbr crit\u00e8re de la faute, dans des conditions donn\u00e9es, c'est le d\u00e9faut de cette prudence et de cette attention moyennes qui marquent la conduite d'un bon p\u00e8re de famille; en d'autres termes, c'est l'absence des soins ordinaires qu'un homme diligent devrait fournir dans les m\u00eames conditions. Or, cette somme de soins varie suivant les circonstances, toujours diverses, de temps, de lieux et de personnes.\nDans Mass\u00e9 v. Gilbert 16, M. le Juge L\u00e9tourneau dit ce qui suit:\nDe sorte que tout ce que la Cour doit se demander, c'est si l'intim\u00e9 Gilbert, en cette occasion et eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la situation des lieux, a bien pris le soin et les pr\u00e9cautions qu'eut pris un propri\u00e9taire prudent et diligent; si oui, l'on peut dire qu'un propri\u00e9taire prudent et diligent n'eut rien fait de plus, rien fait de mieux pour \u00e9viter ce qui est arriv\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9 doit \u00eatre exon\u00e9r\u00e9 en appel comme il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re instance; \u2026\nMais, ajoute l'intim\u00e9e, m\u00eame si le service de nettoyage \u00e9tait efficace et prompt, l'appelante aurait d\u00fb donner \u00e0 tous ses employ\u00e9s les instructions qui s'imposaient pour pr\u00e9venir tout accident de ce genre. Comme dans le cas de service de nettoyage d\u00e9fectueux, la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'appelante serait fond\u00e9e alors, non sur l'article 1054 C.C., mais bien sur l'article 1053 C.C. Il s'agirait alors clairement d'un cas o\u00f9 la faute de l'appelante doit n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre prouv\u00e9e. La th\u00e9orie du risque est inconnue d'ans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et la faute sous l'article 1053, est toujours la base de la responsabilit\u00e9.\nComme je viens de le signaler, il y avait un service d'alarme perfectionn\u00e9, permettant d'avertir les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux divers services, pour qu'ils r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 l'appel le plus rapidement possible. Au moment de l'accident, c'est au moyen de ce syst\u00e8me que le signal a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9, et qu'un employ\u00e9 s'est rendu sur les lieux en quelques minutes pour faire dispara\u00eetre la cause de tout danger. L'intim\u00e9e cependant exige davantage et pr\u00e9tend qu'en outre, les 2,50o, employ\u00e9s de l'appelante pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s au service des comptoirs, auraient d\u00fb \u00e9galement \u00eatre charg\u00e9s de veiller \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des clients, et qu'\u00e0 leurs fonctions normales auraient d\u00fb s'ajouter celles, d\u00e9j\u00e0 confi\u00e9es par la direction de la maison, \u00e0 un groupe d'employ\u00e9s pourtant jug\u00e9s comp\u00e9tents et efficaces par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance.\nLe service existant n'\u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre pas le meilleur, et il ne fait pas de doute qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas suffisant pour pr\u00e9venir tous les accidents. Le syst\u00e8me id\u00e9al propos\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e aurait peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 plus efficace, mais l'appelante aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des exigences que la loi ne requiert pas. On ne peut demander en effet \u00e0 l'appelante d'assigner tous ses employ\u00e9s \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des clients, quand dans une entreprise comme la sienne, les t\u00e2ches doivent \u00eatre n\u00e9cessairement r\u00e9parties. Les principes qui r\u00e9gissent cette cause doivent, il me semble, \u00eatre ceux auxquels est assujettie la responsabilit\u00e9 des muinicipalit\u00e9s, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, qui ont l'obligation d'entretenir leurs trottoirs durant la saison d'hiver. Dans ce dernier cas, comme dans celui qui nous occupe, demander plus que la prudence et la diligence raisonnables, plus que le soin vigilant d'un bon p\u00e8re de famille, serait exiger un degr\u00e9 d'excellence, un niveau ou un standard \u00e9lev\u00e9 de perfection bien au-dessus de la norme reconnue de la responsabilit\u00e9 juridique, et qui, comme cette Cour l'a dit dans Ouellet v. Cloutier 17, rendraient impossible toute activit\u00e9 pratique.\nJe ne puis me convaincre que la Compagnie appelante n'a pas fait preuve de la prudence et de la diligence requises, et il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 nullement d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que son service de nettoyage \u00e9tait d\u00e9fectueux, ou qu'il y ait eu des lenteurs \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l'appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de Bertrand.\nPour toutes ces raisons, je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et l'action de la demanderesse-intim\u00e9e rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours.\nEstey J. (dissenting):\u2014The respondent's claim for damages suffered when she fell while a customer in the appellant's store was dismissed at trial. Upon appeal, the Court of King's Bench 18 reversed this dismissal (Mr. Justice McDougall dissenting) and directed judgment in her favour for $10,000.\nThe respondent, a nurse 56 years of age, on the morning of November 16, 1942, was a customer at the appellant's department store in the City of Montreal. At about 11:45 she approached the exit to University Street and, because of the presence on the main floor of a gooey, sticky liquid, she slipped and fell, sustaining the injuries for which damages are here claimed. The area covered by the liquid was about six inches in diameter upon a floor of Italian marble called travertine. Many customers were coming and going along that point on the main floor. The presence of this liquid was due to a handbag, carried by a woman also leaving the department store, coming open and a bottle of lotion dropping therefrom and breaking upon the floor. Bertrand, a clerk in charge of the clock counter about 2\u00bd yards from where the bottle fell, was serving a customer when he observed the bottle break and the lotion spread upon the floor. The lotion appeared to him to be a gooey, sticky substance. The respondent herself described it as \"very slippery,\" \"white, transparent\" and \"the same colour \u2026 as the floor.\" The woman carrying the handbag did not stop and Bertrand, apprehensive lest some person might fall because of the presence of the liquid, telephoned the caretaking department to come and \"pick it up.\" The latter department, through its signal system, communicated with O'Doherty, an employee of that department, who was then near the rear of the main floor, and he arrived at the spot, as Bertrand estimated, in about three minutes from the time he telephoned. O'Doherty, as he had not been given any particulars, came \"to investigate the trouble\" and \"immediately put a few cartons on the spot,\" which he obtained at Bertrand's clock section, just as a \"precaution \u2026 because of the possibility of slipping.\" Bertrand himself continued waiting upon his customer and within about a half to a minute from the time he telephoned the respondent slipped and fell.\nThe appellant's is a large department store in which a count made at 11:00 o'clock upon the morning in question disclosed 1,283 customers upon the premises. Forty-five minutes later the respondent, one of many customers passing to and from the busy University Street entrance of that store, as already stated, slipped and fell. In these circumstances the respondent did not see the liquid upon the floor and it is not suggested in this appeal that she should have. No fault is, therefore, attributed to the respondent.\nArt. 1053 of the Quebec Civil Code reads:\nToute personne capable de discerner le bien du mal, est responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 par sa faute \u00e0 autrui, soit par son fait, soit par imprudence, n\u00e9gligence ou inhabilet\u00e9.\nEvery person capable of discerning right from wrong is responsible for the damage caused by his fault to another, whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill.\nThe duty under art. 1053 upon those who invite others to come upon their premises for business purposes has been discussed in The Quebec Liquor Commission v. Moore 19; C.N.R. v. Lepage 20; and, among others in the Quebec courts, L'\u0152uvre des Terrains de Jeux de Qu\u00e9bec v. Cannon \u00e8s qual 21; Caza v. Paroissiaux et al 22; Desjardins v. The Gatineau Power Company 23; Brownstein v. Barnett 24.\nSir Lyman Duff (later C.J.), in The Quebec Liquor Commission v. Moore supra, at p. 548 stated:\nI should be sorry indeed to think that the scope of Art. 1053 C.C. could be so restricted as to exclude the responsibility of occupiers of business premises for failure to give warning of traps known by them to exist, exposing persons invited by them to enter the premises for the purposes of their business to injury in consequence thereof.\nand further at p. 549:\nI have the greatest difficulty in assuming that Art. 1053 C.C. does not contemplate as an act of negligence involving fault an invitation to customers by a shopkeeper who is aware that on entering his shop they will, if not warned, be exposed to serious risk of grave injury, without a suspicion of the existence of it, and who presents this invitation without any warning as to the existence of the risk. I cannot but think that to state the proposition is sufficient.\nThat the appellant corporation under art. 1053, as interpreted by the foregoing authorities, owed a duty to take reasonable care that the respondent should not be exposed to danger or peril known to the appellant, the existence of which, in the exercise of reasonable care, would not be known to her, has been accepted by all of the learned judges in the courts below and the appellant, upon the hearing of this appeal, has not contended otherwise. There has been a difference of opinion in the application of this principle to the circumstances here present.\nThat the lotion upon the floor, where so many people were walking, constituted such a peril as would, under the authorities, be classified as a trap, is not seriously disputed. Bertrand himself realized immediately the possibility of someone slipping thereon and telephoned the caretaking department, as he explained, to prevent such an accident as suffered by the respondent. Carmichael, the manager of the caretaking department, said he would have put sawdust upon it, of which there was a quantity \"in containers at convenient locations.\" He had himself under like \"circumstances placed a piece of furniture over things like that.\" O'Doherty, who arrived to clean it up, said it was \"grease or oil or something on the floor\" and he \"immediately put a few cartons on the spot\" which he obtained from Bertrand's clock section.\nThe presence of this lotion upon the floor in that crowded portion of the store made the premises at that point unsafe and immediately the appellant became aware thereof its duty under art. 1053 required that it take reasonable steps to protect its customers from possible injury. The appellant contends that it knew thereof only when Carmichael's department received the telephone call from Bertrand and as a consequence it acted promptly and effectively, thereby performing the duty imposed upon it by law. The respondent, on the other hand, contends that it was, in the circumstances, a part of Bertrand's duty to take reasonable steps to protect customers and, therefore, his knowledge was that of the appellant. It is not suggested that Bertrand was under a duty to remove the lotion, but that it was his duty to take steps to warn the customers by some reasonable measure such as covering the spot to prevent their stepping thereon. Art. 1054, in part, provides:\nLes ma\u00eetres et les commettants sont responsables du dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques et ouvriers dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles ces derniers sont employ\u00e9s.\nMasters and employers are responsible for the damage caused by their servants and workmen in the performance of the work for which they are employed.\nThe knowledge which Bertrand acquired in the performance of the work for which he was employed would be imputed to and become the knowledge of the employer. It is, therefore, important to ascertain if Bertrand was required, in the performance of the work for which he was employed, to take reasonable steps to protect the customers from injury.\nThe appellant contends that Bertrand was a clock salesman and he had no duty, in the circumstances, to protect customers or, if he did have a duty, he discharged that when he telephoned the caretaking department. The evidence does establish that as a salesman he was in charge of the clock counter, but it does not specify his duties as such. Whatever instructions he may have been given at the time of or throughout his employment are not disclosed in the record except that it is conceded he was given no instructions with respect to any duty he owed toward customers. In fact, he stated that upon this occasion his conduct was\nJust based on common sense. I took the initiative. I didn't want an accident to happen. I just 'phoned the caretaker to clean it.\nThe absence of instruction to the employee is not conclusive. In The Governor and Company of Gentlemen Adventurers of England v. Vaillancour 25, the master was held liable, though no relevant instructions had been given by the employer. In that case Sir Lyman Duff (later C.J.), referring to art. 1054, stated at p. 416:\nIf the thing done belongs to the kind of work which the servant is employed to perform or the class of things falling within l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions, then by the plain words of the text responsibility rests upon the employer.\nIt is impossible, in any practical sense, for an employer in the position of the appellant to provide instructions to its sales staff that would cover every conceivable circum- stance. It has, therefore, been recognized that there are well known attributes of certain positions, such as that of salesman, which both the employers and the public have a right to expect the incumbent will perform. It is, in this regard, the duty of the salesman to be courteous and concerned for the comfort, convenience and safety of the customers upon the premises. An owner selling clocks as Bertrand was would be at fault within the meaning of art. 1053 if he did not take reasonable steps to prevent a customer from sitting upon a chair, stepping upon a trap door or a portion of the floor he knew to be unsafe. Bertrand, as a salesman employed by the appellant-owner, was under the same duty. It was one of the attributes of that position. In fact the evidence of the senior employees called on behalf of the appellant would support that view.\nIt is suggested that the employees of the caretaking department (two of whom patrolled the ground floor in question while the foreman and assistant foreman had to \"keep their eye on the conditions throughout the store\") were charged with the protection of the customers against injury from a situation such as created by this lotion. It is the duty of the employees of that department to remove the cause of the danger, but it cannot be suggested, upon the evidence, that these employees, few in number, of all the employees in this large department store, alone have a duty to warn customers of the danger.\nCounsel for the appellant stressed the presence in the store of a system under which the cleaning department would be immediately communicated with by any employee who became aware of a situation such as that created by this lotion. This communication is made through the telephones placed here and there throughout the store. Bertrand used the telephone at his counter and the employees in the cleaning department acted promptly and effectively. An employee who did not telephone would be remiss in his duty and his failure to do so would not be excused upon his statement that he had not been instructed. Bertrand's statement that in telephoning to the cleaning department he took the initiative and acted upon his own common sense does not detract from the fact that in doing so he was performing the duty that, in the circumstances, must be regarded as an essential attribute of his position. It is just the type of conduct that an employer has a right to expect of his responsible employees without specific instructions.\nWe are, in this case, concerned primarily with the vital and inevitable time that must elapse between the employee becoming aware of the danger and the removal thereof by the cleaning department. Throughout the whole of that period, which may be of short or substantial duration, the danger exists and the customers are exposed thereto. The appellant's position is that, though a salesman in charge of a counter is not only aware of the danger but fully conscious of the possibility of a customer suffering an injury, that salesman has no duty to warn the customers. The duties of a salesman such as Bertrand arise out of his position as a representative of the employer in selling and dealing with customers. The employer puts him forward to conduct business on his behalf and as if he were conducting the business himself.\nAn employer in the position of Bertrand and with his knowledge of this danger would not have performed his duty to his customers in merely telephoning the cleaning department. His plain duty would have been to immediately take reasonable steps to warn his customers of that danger.\nThe duty upon the employer's salesman is, in such circumstances, no less. It is part of his duty to be concerned for the care and safety of the customers. Specific instructions to that effect are not necessary. That duty would, by the very nature of his employment, as already stated, be an essential attribute. The law imposes that duty upon the employer to be discharged by either himself or his agent and where injury results from negligent omission of the performance of that duty the liability rests upon the employer. Where, as here, the employer is a limited company, the duty can only be discharged through its agents. A salesman in charge of a counter is such an agent. That it did not give specific instructions to do so, but took it for granted, as it had a right to do, that such a salesman would perform that duty, does not alter its liability in the event of non-performance on the part of the employee.\nIt is negligence on the part of a salesman in the position of Bertrand to observe a dangerous condition, telephone the cleaning department and still allow the danger to persist, when reasonable conduct on his part would either minimize or entirely eliminate that danger. The time between Bertrand's telephoning and the respondent's fall was estimated to be a minute to a minute and a half. In some circumstances that might well be too short a time, but in this particular case it is not contended that Bertrand did not have time in which to take the necessary precautions to warn the customers of this danger before the respondent fell. In not doing so he failed to perform that duty which his position required of him and his failure in that regard was a direct cause of the injury.\nIt is pointed out that any act on Bertrand's part to provide a reasonable guard or notice would require that he \"desist from the selling of clocks in which he was engaged at the time.\" That the selling of clocks should supersede the protection of customers from imminent danger by a clerk who had the means at his hand to protect these customers is a suggestion that cannot be accepted. Bertrand left the customer to telephone and also to assist the respondent after she had fallen. A very short space of time would have been sufficient for him to place cartons from his counter, a chair or some other appropriate warning over the lotion and it would have avoided the accident and his conduct would have been well understood and probably appreciated by the customer he was serving.\nThere are cases where the danger is created unbeknown to the occupier of the premises. In that event the occupier has a reasonable time to become aware thereof. Once, however, he knows of the existence of the danger he must proceed at once with reasonable steps to protect his business guests. In this case the appellant knew immediately of the danger through Bertrand, who had at his counter the means which his position required should be used to protect the respondent and other customers.\nThere are other employees, possibly salesmen, whose knowledge of a danger such as this could not be attributed to the appellant. Bertrand, however, was the salesman in charge of the nearby clock counter when he saw the danger and appreciated the possibility of injury. His duty, as above indicated, cannot be restricted to customers upon whom he was waiting, but would include those within a reasonable distance of his counter. The danger here created was within a few feet of his counter. Such knowledge, acquired by so responsible a salesman, must be attributed to the appellant. Bertrand had at his hand the means the use of which would have guarded and thereby warned the customers of the danger until such time as the employees of the caretaking department might remove it. His falure to take these reasonable steps constituted a fault in the sense indicated by My Lord the Chief Justice (then Rinfret J.) in C.N.R. v. Lepage 26.\nIt is a familiar principle that neglect may, in law, be considered a fault only if it corresponds with a duty to act.\nCounsel for the appellant contended that the majority of the learned judges in the Court of King's Bench based their decision upon the modern French construction of art. 1384 of the Code Napol\u00e9on, under which liability is predicated upon what has been described as a social responsibility or, as stated by Anglin J. (later C.J.):\nThere is no doubt that the tendency in recent years of the French courts and the text writers has been to hold the master answerable for any wrong committed by his servant while in his employment, unless the act complained of be wholly foreign to his functions as servant. They hold the master liable if the servant's act be in any way connected with his employment.\nCurley v. Latreille 27.\nArt. 1384 of the Code Napol\u00e9on corresponds to art. 1054 of the Civil Code, but the language of the latter is different in important respects from that of the former and has been construed not to support liability upon such a basis. This was emphasized in Curley v. Latreille supra; The Governor and Company of Gentlemen Adventurers of England v. Vaillancourt 28; and Moreau v. Labette 29. Mignault J. in the Vaillancourt case at p. 427 stated:\nJe suis encore du m\u00eame avis, et il ne me semble pas inutile de le dire encore \u00e0 raison de certaines solutions de la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise qu'on a invoqu\u00e9es pour donner \u00e0 l'article 1054 C.C., quant \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 des ma\u00eetres et commettants, une interpr\u00e9tation extensive qu'il ne comporte pas dans mon opinion. Il faut bien reconna\u00eetre que la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise a pris depuis quelques ann\u00e9es une orientation qui l'\u00e9carte de plus en plus de la doctrine traditionnelle. Elle admet de nouvelles th\u00e9ories en mati\u00e8re de responsabilit\u00e9 civile, comme l'abus du droit, l'enrichissement sans cause et la responsabilit\u00e9 des irresponsables, enfants en bas \u00e2ge et insens\u00e9s (Planiol t. 2, no. 878). On peut m\u00eame dire qu'elle tend \u00e0 faire abstraction de la faute et \u00e0 la remplacer par la conception du risque. Mais n'oublions pas que nous avons un code dont le texte doit nous servir de r\u00e8gle, et que si les opinions des auteurs et les d\u00e9cisions de la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise ne peuvent se concilier avec ce texte, c'est le texte et non pas ces opinions et ces d\u00e9cisions que nous devons suivre. Je ne serais certainement pas partisan d'une interpr\u00e9tation de notre code qui en ferait pr\u00e9valoir la lettre sur l'esprit, mais quand le texte est clair et sans \u00e9quivoque on n'a pas besoin de chercher ailleurs.\nThe formal judgment in the Court of King's Bench quoted from the reasons of the learned trial judge:\nC'est un pur accident dont la Demanderesse doit subir les cons\u00e9quences, vu qu'il lui est impossible d'en rechercher l'auteur et encore moins d'en attribuer la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la D\u00e9fenderesse. Il n'y a aucune preuve de faute par omission, n\u00e9gligence ou incurie de la part de la D\u00e9fenderesse.\nand then set out that the lotion constituted a danger or trap from which the appellant was under a duty to protect respondent, that Bertrand had failed in his duty to do so and his failure must be attributed to the absence of instructions on the part of the appellant. The failure to give these instructions constituted a breach of duty to the respondent and, therefore, the appellant was liable. The formal judgment, therefore, does not support the contention of counsel for the appellant and, moreover, Mr. Justice Bissonnette, who quotes more extensively from the French authors, states near the end of his judgment:\nLa seule proposition l\u00e9gale que j'ai voulu soutenir, c'est que la connaissance et l'imminence d'un danger, lorsqu'il y a temps utile et moyen efficace pour y parer, constituant une faute pouvant engendrer responsabilit\u00e9 si l'on n\u00e9glige ou s'abstient d'agir. Et ce principe, en outre de la doctrine que j'ai cit\u00e9e, me para\u00eet conforme \u00e0 la jurisprudence de nos Cours, m\u00eame de celles qui sont autoris\u00e9es \u00e0 juger selon la Common law.\nIf Bertrand had not a duty to warn the respondent as I have above indicated, then I am in agreement with the view expressed by my brother Cartwright, under which the appellant is liable, apart from any question of vicarious liability, for its own negligence in failing to properly instruct its employees, as he has indicated.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Cartwright J. (dissenting):\u2014For the reasons given by my brother Estey I agree with the conclusion at which he has arrived.\nAs he has pointed out, it is established by authority, and indeed was not questioned before us, that the appellant owed a duty to the respondent, as a customer in the store, to take reasonable care that she should not be exposed to unusual danger of which it knew or ought to have known.\nThe colourless and slippery lotion upon the travertine floor constituted an unusual danger and was the cause of the injury of which the respondent complains. The appellant, being a corporation, could have knowledge of this danger and could take such steps as might be reason ably necessary to protect its customers only through its servants or employees.\nThe appellant had provided a department whose duty it was to keep the store in a condition of cleanliness and safety and to remove dangers which might from time to time arise. The evidence indicates that this department operated efficiently and in the case at bar actually removed the source of danger within a few minutes after its creation. It is clear from the evidence, however, that in case of a danger arising suddenly and fortuitously, as happened in this case, the members of the cleaning department were dependent on the employees in the vicinity of such danger to notify them of its existence. In a store so large and serving so many customers as that of the appellant it is reasonable to suppose that such dangers would from time to time arise and this probability was recognized by the appellant, as is evidenced, amongst other things, by its installation of a system permitting prompt communication with the members of the cleaning staff. It is also clear that in the case of such a danger arising there would inevitably be an interval of time between the summoning of the members of the cleaning department and their arrival. In my opinion the appellant's duty to protect its customers from unusual danger was not discharged by setting in motion a system, however efficient, designed for the removal of the danger. It was, I think, part of its duty to warn the customers during the interval of time mentioned above which must necessarily elapse before the danger could be removed. It appears to me that the appellant is upon the horns of a dilemma. If, as my brother Estey holds, it was part of the duty of employees such as Bertrand to notify the members of the cleaning department and, pending their arrival, to warn customers of the danger, it is clear that Bertrand failed to perform the latter of such duties and the appellant would be responsible for his failure. If on the other hand the arrangements between the appellant and Bertrand (whether resulting from express instructions or from lack of instructions) were such that these duties did not rest upon him then I think that the appellant was negligent in failing to make reasonable provision for the warning of its customers of an unusual danger during the interval between the time of its obtaining knowledge of such danger and the time of its removal, and the appellant would be liable to the respondent not vicariously for the negligence of its employee but directly for its own negligence in failing to properly instruct its employees.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Scott, Hugessen, Macklaier, Chisholm, Smith & Davis.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Brais, Campbell & Mercier.\n1 Q.R.

Marston, (Defendant) Respondent.\n1951: March 19, 20, 21; 1951: May 18\nPresent: Kerwin, Kellock, Estey, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nAppeal\u2014Trial before judge alone\u2014Pure question of fact\u2014Principles governing appellate court\u2014Practice\u2014Effect to be given on appeal to defence not raised in pleadings nor established in evidence\u2014Rules of Practice (Ont.) r. 143.\nThe appellant, a business consultant, conducted lengthy negotiations with a view to securing a controlling interest in three companies on behalf of the respondent, a financier, as to all of which the latter finally decided not to purchase. The appellant brought an action upon an alleged verbal agreement by which he claimed he was to be paid a reasonable sum for services rendered. The respondent pleaded the agreement was that payment was to be made on a commission basis and only in the event of purchase, and further that the appellant was precluded from advancing his claim because of failure to register as a business broker pursuant to The Real Estate and Business Brokers Act, 1946 (Ont.) c. 85. Before the Court of Appeal he further argued that the services for which payment was claimed were such as, if rendered, brought the appellant within the term \u201cinvestment counsel\u201d as defined by The Securities Act, 1945 (Ont.) c. 22, and that he was prohibited from so acting unless registered as such under the Act.\nThe trial judge accepted the evidence of the appellant in preference to that of the respondent and awarded him judgment, but this judgment was reversed on appeal.\nHeld: That the Court of Appeal erred in over-ruling the findings of fact made by the trial judge and the appeal from its judgment should be allowed and the judgment pronounced at trial restored.\nPer: Kerwin J.\u2014The principles upon which an Appellate Court should proceed in dealing with the findings of a trial judge on a question of fact are those laid down in Hontestroom (Owners) v. Sagaporack (Owners) [1927] A.C. 37 at 50; Powell v. Streatham Manor Nursing Home [1935] A.C. 243 at 264; Caldeira v. Gray [1936] 1 All. E.R. 540.\nHeld: also that the defence as to The Securities Act should not be entertained, as it was not pleaded at the trial as required by the Ontario Rules of Practice, r. 143, and since a factual foundation was not clearly established in the evidence, no effect should be given to the allegation of illegality at this stage of the proceedings.\nHeld: further that as to The Real Estate and Business Brokers Act, the services rendered by the appellant did not fall within the section since it was not the legislative intention to include in the term \u201cbusiness\u201d, the shares of an incorporated company. Macaura v. Northern Assurance Co. Ltd., [1925] A.C. 619 at 626, and the services rendered were in reference to the contemplated purchase of stock in the companies and not to the purchase of the business owned by such companies.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the appellant.\nG.W. Mason K.C. for the appellant.\nR.F. Wilson K.C. for the respondent.\nKERWIN J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons for judgment of my brother Cartwright. The principles upon which an Appellate Court should proceed in dealing with findings of a trial judge are found in the speech of Lord Sumner, approved by the other members of the House of Lords, in Hontestroom (Owners) v. Sagaporack (Owners)[1], and are as follows:\n(1) Does it appear from the President\u2019s judgment that he made full judicial use of the opportunity given him by hearing the viva voce evidence? (2) Was the evidence before him, affecting the relative credibility of the witnesses, which would make the exercise of his critical faculties in judging the demeanour of the witnesses a useful and necessary operation? (3) Is there any glaring improbability about the story accepted, sufficient in itself to constitute \u201ca governing fact,, which in relation to others has created a wrong impression,\u201d or any specific misunderstanding or disregard of a material fact, or any \u201cextreme and overwhelming pressure\u201d that has had the same effect?\nWhile this was an Admiralty case, the same principles apply in ordinary common law cases: Powell v. Streatham Manor Nursing Home[2]; which latter is referred to in a decision of the Privy Council, Caldeira v. Gray[3]. These principles have been followed and applied in this Court.\nIn the present case, the trial judge accepted the evidence of the appellant in preference to that of the respondent, and his findings of fact should not be disturbed. In connection with the point as to the Securities Act of Ontario, the true rule is set forth by Anglin J., as he then was, in Antoniou v. Union Bank of Canada[4]. There, referring to a point taken for the first time in this Court, he says:\nit should not be entertained, as, if it had been raised on the pleadings or at the trial, evidence might have been adduced to shew that these words import a definite and precise liability.\nThis was agreed to in terms by Sir Louis Davies and to the same effect are Mr. Justice Mignault\u2019s remarks at page 262. While in the present case the objection was taken before the Court of Appeal, it was not dealt with by that Court, and, in any event, under the circumstances the same rule should be applied.\nThe judgment of Kellock, Estey, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, setting aside the judgment of Wells J. in favour of the plaintiff for $5,300 and costs and directing that the action be dismissed with costs. The plaintiff\u2019s claim was for services rendered to the defendant between May 23, 1947 and February 3, 1948. During this period the defendant was desirous of buying the control of a business and was prepared to pay a sum in the neighbourhood of $500,000 if he could find a business which he regarded as satisfactory. The plaintiff is described as a business consultant and was recommended to the defendant by a bank manager of whose branch both parties were customers.\nIt is common ground that the defendant asked the plaintiff to perform various services for him but there is direct contradiction as to the terms of the agreement between them. The position taken by the plaintiff was that during the period mentioned he performed numerous services for the defendant in connection with three different companies in each of which the defendant considered that he might purchase control, that from about June 27, 1947 to February 3, 1948, at the defendant\u2019s request, he devoted most of his time to the defendant\u2019s business and engaged in no other business activity without first obtaining the defendant\u2019s consent, that the rate of remuneration to be paid was not discussed and that it was an implied term of the arrangement that the plaintiff should be paid a reasonable sum for his services. It is established that during the period in question the plaintiff received no remuneration from any other source.\nAs to White\u2019s Hardware Limited, one of the three companies mentioned, the plaintiff testified that it was agreed between him and the defendant that if an option on the shares of such company was obtained by the defendant the plaintiff\u2019s fees for all services in connection with that company should be fixed at $4,000, regardless of whether the defendant exercised the option. This option was obtained. The plaintiff testified that when it was obtained the defendant was very pleased and agreed to pay him $6,000 instead of the $4,000 previously agreed upon. The defendant later decided not to exercise this option.\nThe defendant asserted that it was expressly agreed that if as a result of the plaintiff\u2019s services or efforts the defendant actually made a purchase he would pay a suitable commission to the plaintiff but that unless he made such a purchase the plaintiff was to be entitled to nothing. As to the option mentioned above the defendant said that he was pleased when it was obtained but that the agreement was that he should pay the plaintiff $6,000 only if it was exercised.\nFaced with this conflict of evidence the learned trial judge has stated in terms that he accepts the evidence of the plaintiff in preference to that of the defendant and has found the facts to be as set out in the brief summary of the position taken by the plaintiff given above.\nThe learned trial judge while accepting the plaintiff\u2019s evidence as to what was said between the parties in regard to payment for services rendered in connection with White\u2019s Hardware Limited held that there was no consideration for the defendant\u2019s promise to pay $6,000 instead of $4,000. In this I respectfully agree. At the time of the agreement to pay the $4,000 the plaintiff had an enforceable claim against the defendant for payment of a reasonable sum in consideration of the services which he had rendered at the defendant\u2019s request. The defendant offered to pay and the plaintiff agreed to accept $4,000 in full satisfaction of such claim upon condition that the option was obtained. There is no evidence of any further consideration being given by the plaintiff for the defendant\u2019s promise to pay the additional $2,000.\nThe learned trial judge fixed the sums of $1,000 and $300, respectively, as being reasonable remuneration for the services rendered in respect of the other two companies. I am not satisfied that either of these amounts is not warranted by the evidence.\nThe learned Justices of Appeal were unanimous in deciding that the learned trial judge had erred in accepting the plaintiff\u2019s version of the facts. Their reasons for so holding were that the plaintiff\u2019s story was too unlikely to be credited and that the finding of the learned trial judge was falsified by the following testimony given by the plaintiff himself:\u2014\nQ. Now am I right in saying these three transactions cover a period roughly from May 27, 1947, to February 3, 1948?\nA. That\u2019s right.\nQ. During that period you were away on vacation for about one month?\nA. That\u2019s right.\nQ. And so that the period covered was approximately seven months?\nA. That\u2019s right. Q. And did the defendant get any benefit from any one of these three transactions?\nA. Well, he got a lot of experience. He picked my brains for seven months, asked me all kinds of questions. He said that I certainly knew my business and he was glad to be connected with a man like me. He was looking for a man like me for a couple of years. So I don\u2019t know that he got any monetary rewards but he probably learned a few things. I know I learned a few things from him.\nWith the greatest respect to the learned Justices of Appeal, after a careful perusal of the evidence, I am unable to find any inherent improbability in the plaintiff\u2019s story. Indeed it appears to me more likely that the arrangement between the parties should be that the plaintiff should receive reasonable payment for the time and skill he devoted to the defendant\u2019s business than that for several months he should have applied himself almost exclusively to serving the defendant on the understanding that if in the end the defendant decided against making any purchase, as he was perfectly free to do, the plaintiff should receive nothing.\nThe evidence indicates that the plaintiff was not a business broker or a commission agent in the ordinary sense of such terms. His primary duty appears to have been not so much to bring about a completed transaction as to obtain information and to give advice which would assist the defendant in deciding whether or not to enter into transactions which were from time to time under consideration and some of which were proposed by the defendant himself. Situations might well arise where it would be the plaintiff\u2019s duty to dissuade the defendant from entering into a proposed purchase.\nI am unable to find in the extract from the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, quoted above, anything inconsistent with his story. From the very nature of the services which the plaintiff was engaged to render it was obvious that the defendant would obtain no ascertainable financial benefit therefrom if he ultimately decided not to make a purchase. The consideration given by the plaintiff was the devotion of his time and skill over a considerable period to the defendant\u2019s service at the defendant\u2019s request.\nIn my respectful opinion the Court of Appeal erred in over-ruling the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge. Two points remain to be considered. The respondent argues that even if the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge are accepted the action must nonetheless fail, first by reason of the provisions of The Real Estate and Business Brokers Act, 1946, Statutes of Ontario 10 George VI Cap. 85 and alternatively by reason of the provisions of The Securities Act, 1945, Statutes of Ontario 9 George VI Cap. 22.\nParagraph 21 of the Statement of Defence as amended at the opening of the trial reads as follows:\nThe Defendant says, as the fact is, that the Plaintiff is precluded from advancing the claim set up in his Statement of Claim because of his failure to register himself as a Business Broker pursuant to the provisions of Sections 36 & 37 of the Real Estate and Business Brokers Act, Ch. 85, Statutes of Ontario, 1946.\nIt is conceded that the plaintiff was not registered under The Real Estate and Business Brokers Act at the time of rendering the services for which remuneration is claimed in this action. Section 36 of the Act is as follows:\nNo action shall be brought for commission or for remuneration for services in connection with a trade in real estate unless at the time of rendering such services the person bringing the action was registered or exempt from registration and the court may stay any such action at any time upon summary application.\nIf the words of this section are read in their ordinary and natural meaning it is obvious that the services rendered by the plaintiff do not fall within the section. It is necessary, however, to consider the artificial and greatly extended meanings given to the words \u201ctrade\u201d, \u201creal estate\u201d and \u201cbusiness\u201d in the interpretation section of the Act. These are as follows:\nSection 1. (k) \u201ctrade\u201d shall include a disposition or acquisition of or transaction in real estate by sale, purchase, agreement for sale, exchange, option, lease, rental or otherwise and any offer or attempt to list real estate for the purpose of such a disposition or transaction, and any act, advertisement, conduct or negotiation, directly or indirectly, in furtherance of any disposition, acquisition, transaction, offer or attempt, and the verb \u201ctrade\u201d shall have a corresponding meaning.\nSection 1. (e) \u201creal estate\u201d shall include real property, leasehold and business whether with or without premises, fixtures, stock-in-trade, goods or chattels in connection with the operation of the business;\nSection 1. (b) \u201cbusiness\u201d shall mean an undertaking carried on for the purpose of gain or profit and shall include an interest in any such undertaking, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall include boarding house, hotel, stores, tourist camp and tourist home; Wide though these definitions are, I am in respectful agreement with the learned trial judge that it was not the intention of the legislature to include in the term \u201cbusiness\u201d the shares of an incorporated company. The acquisition of shares in a company is not, I think, the acquisition of an interest in the undertaking carried on by such company. In Macaura v. Northern Assurance Company, Limited[5] at page 626, Lord Buckmaster said:\n* * * Now, no shareholder has any right to any item of property owned by the company, for he has no legal or equitable interest therein. He is entitled to a share in the profits while the company continues to carry on business and a share in the distribution of the surplus assets when the company is wound up.\nIt is clear that the services of the plaintiff were in reference to the contemplated purchase of shares of stock in the companies mentioned in the pleadings and not to the purchase of the businesses owned by such companies.\nThe defence based on The Securities Act, 1945 is that the services for which the plaintiff claims payment are such that if the plaintiff rendered them he fell within the definition of \u201cinvestment counsel\u201d contained in the Act and that he was prohibited from so acting unless registered. Reliance is placed upon section 1(g), reading as follows:\n(g) \u201cinvestment counsel\u201d shall mean any person or company who engages in or holds himself or itself out as engaging in the business of advising others, for compensation, either directly or through publications or writings, as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling securities, or who, for compensation and as part of a regular business, issues or promulgates analyses or reports concerning securities, but shall not include,\u2014\n* * *\n(v) such other persons or companies not within the intent of this clause, as the Commission may designate;\nand upon section 7(1) (d):\n7. (1) No person shall,\u2014\n* * *\n(d) act as an investment counsel unless he is registered as an investment counsel and such registration has been made in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the regulations.\nThis defence was not pleaded, and no attempt appears to have been made at the trial to base any argument upon it. The following question and answer appear in the cross-examination of the plaintiff:\nQ. You are not, I understand, registered under the Securities Act?\nA. No, that is right.\nBut the purpose of this question appears to have been to negative, as regards the plaintiff, the exemption from the requirement of registration under The Real Estate and Business Brokers Act provided by section 16(b) of that act in certain circumstances for persons registered under The Securities Act.\nWe are informed by counsel that the Securities Act was mentioned in argument in the Court of Appeal and that counsel for the defendant asked in that Court for leave to amend the Statement of Defence by pleading the Securities Act \u201cif necessary\u201d. No order for an amendment was made. Henderson J.A., with whom Roach J.A. agrees says in his reasons for judgment:\nThe alleged necessity of his requiring to be licensed under The Real Estate and Business Brokers\u2019 Act was argued before us but there was no argument before us with respect to The Securities Act. In the view I take of the case it is not necessary for me to deal with either of these issues.\nHogg J.A. who delivered separate reasons does not refer to the Act.\nThere is no reference to the Securities Act in the appellant\u2019s factum. The only references to it found in the respondent\u2019s factum are a sentence in Part I\u2014\u201dThe plaintiff was not registered under the Securities Act\u201d\u2014and in Part II where the fourth point in issue in the appeal is said to be:\nIV. Whether the Plaintiff has a right of action by reason of his failure to register under the Real Estate and Business Brokers\u2019 Act, or The Securities Act, 1945. The Respondent contends that no right of action exists in the absence of registration.\nBefore us counsel for the respondent submitted that it was not necessary for the defendant to plead the Securities Act as it is a public statute, but asked leave to amend if the Court should be of the view that an amendment was necessary to enable the defendant to rely on this defence.\nIn my view under the Ontario practice it was necessary for the defendant, if he wished to avail himself of this defence, to so plead as to make it plain that he was relying on the fact that the plaintiff was not registered under the Act as rendering the contract illegal. This is, I think, the effect of Rule 143 of the Ontario Rules of Practice which provides:\n143. A defendant to an action or counterclaim shall raise all matters which show the action or counterclaim not to be maintainable, or that the transaction is either void or voidable in point of law, and all such grounds of defence as if not raised would be likely to take the opposite party by surprise, or would raise issues of fact not arising out of the preceding pleadings, as for instance, fraud, the Statute of Limitations, release, payment, performance, facts showing illegality either by statute or common law, or the Statute of Frauds.\nAs was said by Brett J.A. in Clarke v. Callow[6]:\n* * * If he (a defendant) means to deny the legality of a contract he has entered into, he must say so in plain terms.\nI do not find it necessary to decide whether in the case at bar the amendment should be permitted. In my view the evidence is insufficient to support the defence. No doubt if the contract relied upon by the plaintiff was to render services which he was prohibited by the Statute from undertaking it would be illegal and the assistance of the Court would not be given to enforce it. This rule is clearly stated in the judgment of this Court in Commercial Life Assurance Co. v. Drever[7], a case in which the defence was sufficiently raised in the pleadings. But the statute renders the contract illegal only if the plaintiff was required by the terms of the Statute to be registered. Registration is required if he was acting as an investment counsel. It is, I think, doubtful whether the evidence as to the services which he rendered indicates prima facie that the plaintiff was engaged in the business described in the opening words of clause (g) of section 1, quoted above, but that clause excludes from the definition such persons not within the intent of the clause as the Commission may designate and section 78(e) provides:\n78. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council may make regulations,\u2014(e) designating any person or company or any class of persons or companies which shall be deemed not to be investment counsel;\nFor all that appears in the record even if otherwise he would have been required to register under the Act, as to which I express no opinion, the plaintiff may have been relieved from such requirement by designation of the Commission or by regulation made by the Lieutenant\u2011Governor in Council. It may be that had the defence of illegality by reason of the Statute been pleaded some onus would have fallen upon the plaintiff to establish his exemption from the obligation to be registered but, as has already been pointed out, not only was there no reference to this defence in the pleading but nothing occurred during the course of the trial to suggest that it was proposed to rely upon it.\nWe should not, I think, at this stage of the proceedings, give effect to an allegation of illegality which was not raised in the pleadings, was not mentioned at the trial and the factual foundation of which is not clearly established in evidence.\nFor the above reasons I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment pronounced at the trial, with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mason, Foulds, Arnup, Walter and Weir.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Day, Wilson, Kelly, Martin and Morden.\n[1] [1927] A.C. 37 at 50.\n[2] [1935] A.C. 243 at 264.\n[3] [1936] 1 All.

The laws of Canada as regards such principles are the same as the laws of England and the statements of law as enunciated by the Judicial Committee have been followed consistently in the judgments of this Court.

MacTavish K.C. and J. C. Osborne for the appellant.\nJ. A. Prud'homme K.C. and J. B. Major K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014The appellant was the owner of a large property situated in the City of Hull, on the east side of Laurier Street, and extending to the Ottawa river. The frontage on Laurier street is 456 feet, and the total area is 6.53 acres, of which an unopened street constitutes 0.75 acres leaving a net area of 5.68 acres. The appellant is a Canadian corporation with head office in Montreal, and operates mills at St. Lambert, Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, Ogdensburg, Welland and Hull. At the site expropriated is located the clothing and canvas division, where for many years prosperous operations have been carried on, the operating profits before income tax, having been in 1947, $183,435. Pursuant to section 9 of the Expropriation Act, the respondent initiated expropriation proceedings on the 19th of May, 1944, and on the 7th of May, 1946. The first covered the vacant land having an area of 4 acres situated to the south, and the second affected a piece of land contiguous to the north, having an area of 1.6 acres, and on which several buildings are erected.\nThe action was heard before the Exchequer Court, and on the 23rd of December, 1948, the President fixed the compensation at $45,800 for the first expropriated property, with interest at the rate of 5 per cent from the 19th of May, 1944, and at $350,000 for the second expropriated property without interest. The appellant claims that these amounts are inadequate. It is contended that a total amount of $726,262.58 should have been awarded. By the information, a sum of $329,791.73 was offered for total compensation, including all loss and damage, if any, arising out of the expropriations.\nWhile the principles to be applied in assessing compensation to the owner for property expropriated by the Crown under the provisions of the Expropriation Act, c. 64, R.S.C. 1927, and under various other Canadian statutes in which powers of expropriation are given, have been long since settled by decisions of the Judicial Committee and this Court in a manner which appears to us to be clear, it is perhaps well to restate them. The decision of the Judicial Committee in Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste 2, where expropriation proceedings were taken under the provisions of The Railway Act, 1903, determined that the law of Canada as regards the principles upon which compensation for land taken was to be awarded was the same as the law of England at that time and the judgment delivered by Lord Dunedin expressly approved the statement of these principles contained in the judgments of Vaughan-Williams and Fletcher-Moulton, LL. JJ. in Re Lucas and Chesterfield Gas and Water Board 3. The subject-matter of the expropriation in the Cedars Rapids case consisted of two islands and certain reserved rights over a point of land in the St. Lawrence River, the principal value of which lay not in the land itself but in the fact that these islands were so situate as to be necessary for the construction of a water power development on the river. It is in this case that the expression appears that where the element of value over and above the bare value of the ground itself consists in adaptability for a certain undertaking, the value to the owner is to be taken as the price which possible intended undertakers would give and that that price must be tested by the imaginary market which would have ruled had the land been exposed for sale before any undertakers had secured the powers or acquired the other subjects which make the undertaking as a whole a realized possibility. That decision was followed in the same year by a second judgment of the Judicial Committee in the case of Pastoral Finance Association v. The Minister 4, where Lord Moulton, in considering a claim for compensation for properties taken by the Government of New South Wales under the Public Works Act 1900 of that State, said that the owners were entitled to receive as compensation the value of the land to them and that probably the most practical form in which the matter could be put was that they were entitled to that which a prudent man, in their position, would have been willing to give for the land sooner than fail to obtain it.\nThese statements of the law have been followed consistently in the judgments of this Court. In Lake Erie and Northern Railway v. Brantford Golf and Country Club 5, in proceedings under the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 37, Duff J. as he then was, in discussing the phrase \"the value of the land to them\", after saying that the phrase does not imply that compensation is to be given for value resting on motives and considerations that cannot be measured by any economic standard, said in part:\nIt does not follow, of course, that the owner whose land is com-pulsorily taken is entitled only to compensation measured by the scale of the selling price of the land in the open market. He is entitled to that in any event, but in his hands the land may be capable of being used for the purpose of some profitable business which he is carrying on or desires to carry on upon it and, in such circumstances it may well be that the selling price of the land in the open market would be no adequate compensation to him for the loss of the opportunity to carry on that business there. In such a case Lord Moulton in Pastoral Finance Association v. The Minister 6, has given what he describes as a practical formula, which is that the owner is entitled to that which a prudent person in his position would be willing to give for the land sooner than fail to obtain it.\nIn the same year, in Lake Erie and Northern Railway v. Schooley 7, Davies J. quoted the passage from the judgment of Lord Moulton above referred to and adopted it as stating the true principle, a statement with which Anglin J. concurred. In Montreal Island Power Co. v. The Town of Laval 8, Duff C.J. again referred to the formula enunciated by Lord Moulton as accurately stating the principle to be applied where land was compulsorily taken under the authority of an expropriation act, and in Jalbert v. The King 9; The King v. Northumberland Ferries 10 and in Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. The King 11, the principle so stated was adopted and applied. The proper manner of the application of the principle so clearly stated cannot, in our opinion, be more accurately stated than in the judgment of Rand J. in the last-mentioned case at p. 715.\n* * * the owner at the moment of expropriation is to be deemed as without title, but all else remaining the same, and the question is what would he, as a prudent man, at that moment, pay for the property rather than be ejected from it.\nWe are unable to avoid the conclusion that the learned President did not apply these principles in the case at bar. In his reasons for judgment he says:\nWhere an owner makes a claim for property taken from him section 47 (i.e. of The Exchequer Court Act) permits compensation to him only to the extent of the value of such property.\nLater, he expresses the following views:\nIt is only the form of the property that is changed; instead of the land, the owner has its money equivalent. It is also clear that the money equivalent referred to is the market value of the land, that is to say, the amount of money the owner could turn it into if he offered it for sale.\nHe also states:\nIn the case of In re Lucas and Chesterfield Gas and Water Board 12, in which Fletcher-Moulton L.J. stated that the money equivalent of the land was estimated on the value to the owner, and not on the value to the purchaser, it was clear that even although the land had special adaptability for a particular purpose its value to the owner was confined to its market value. That means that it cannot be more than it would fetch in the market. And finally, referring to his own judgment in Thomas Lawson & Sons, Limited 13, he says:\nI then expressed the opinion that this definition of \"value to the owner\" is essentially the same as that of \"fair market value.\"\nWith deference, we are unable to agree with these state-ments which, in our view, are not the true expression of the law.\nWith regard to the property first expropriated we think that, applying the principles laid down by the majority of this Court in Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. The King (supra) an allowance of ten per cent for compulsory taking should be added to the value of the land and buildings expropriated, but that apart from this the appellant has not made out its claim that the compensation allowed in respect of such property was inadequate. In the result the amount allowed should be increased from $45,800 to $48,880.\nAs to the second expropriation, the learned President valued the land at $9,000 per acre, because in his view, during the period that extended between the two expropriations, the land increased in value and, as the area covers 1.68 acres, he awarded $15,120. He found that the reconstruction cost of all the buildings was $478,032 less depreciation amounting to $188,296, leaving a depreciated value of $289,736. To these items he added $435 for fixtures, making a grand total of $305,291. The appellant produced a statement showing a loss of $76,920.96 plus an item of $2,550 as the depreciation in value of certain chattels, making a total claim for loss by disturbance, amounting to $79,470.96. The learned President was of opinion that even if it were conceded that the owner of the expropriated property had a right to compensation for loss by disturbance of his business, the amount of the appellant's claim under this head was difficult to determine as the appellant was left in possession and continued its operations for the time being. He also took the view that, even if the defendant were entitled to compensation for loss by disturbance, it had no right at the time of the judgment to receive the full amount of its claim for a loss that will happen only in the future, if it happens at all. The learned President, while expressing the opinion that the appellant was not entitled to more than the present value of such prospective loss, reached the conclusion that the evidence supported the claim that the appellant's loss by reason of disturbance, would amount to $79,470.96.\nThe learned President concluded that the maximum amounts at which he would estimate the various items of the appellant's claim on the second expropriation, if he were required to do so, item by item, would be $15,120 for the land, $289,736 for the buildings and mechanical equipment, $435 for the fixtures, and $79,470.96 for the loss by disturbance of business, making a total of $384,761.96. He held, however, that the valuation should not be made piecemeal, but as a whole, and for the second expropriation he awarded a lump sum of $350,000. It was his view that this amount would adequately cover every factor or element of value, including that of loss by disturbance of business, that could properly be taken into account, and at the same time meet the tests of value to which he referred in his judgment.\nIt cannot be determined how the $350,000 awarded is distributed amongst the items above set out. Assuming that the whole of the reduction from the total of $384,761.96 was applied to the claim for disturbance the amount would be made up as follows:\nLand\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026... $ 15,120\nDepreciated value of the buildings and\nmechanical equipment\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 289,736\nFixtures\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 435\nLoss by disturbance\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 44,709\n$350,000\nIn determining whether or not the total awarded is adequate it is necessary to consider the evidence in some detail. The buildings on the lands secondly expropriated were four in number, a main factory building of stone and brick construction, a tarpaulin and waterproofing building, a garage and an auto shelter or shed. The main factory building was construced in 1907. It was established in evidence that the building was well suited for the type of manufacturing carried on there and which the company operating also at Montreal and elsewhere in Canada was desirous of continuing. In these premises the company had carried on operations which realized substantial profits, with the exception of the year 1938, during the period 1937 to 1945 inclusive. While the expropriation vesting title in the Crown took place in the spring of the year 1946, the company was permitted to remain in possession and its operations in that year and the year following resulted also in substantial profits. The site on Laurier Avenue, in the residential portion of Hull, possessed for the owner the great advantage of being close to a large and available supply of labour suitable for employment in the company's operations and being not far distant from one of the principal bridges across the river leading to the City of Ottawa. While the company, in anticipation of being required to yield possession of the premises, had endeavoured to find a suitable property in Hull for the carrying on of their operations, they had not been able to find any and, according to Mr. E. S. Sherwood, a real esate broker having a wide experience in this district, no comparable buildings for an operation of the magnitude of the Woods Manufacturing Company were available either in Ottawa or Hull and he considered that it was doubtful that any such property would become available. The company had purchased land for a site in Overbrook in the Township of Gloucester, lying to the east of the city of Ottawa and a distance of six miles from its then location, but upon consideration had concluded that it was too far from a suitable supply of labour and had abandoned the idea of building there. Apparently inquiries in the immediate neighbourhood of Hull had not resulted in the company finding a suitable site there and, while some were available further down the Ottawa River, operations there would be faced with difficulty in getting the necessary help. The company's desire to continue its operations in Hull or its immediate vicinity was made plain.\nThere was a divergence of opinion among the experts as to the value of the property. For the company, Mr. W. H. Bosley, a real estate agent with wide experience in valuations and real estate operations generally, in answer to a question by the learned trial judge, expressed the opinion that if the owners were desirous of disposing of the property on the market they could have obtained $280,000 for it. Having said this, however, he said that if he were representing a purchaser he would not feel that the property could have been bought at that figure, assuming the owner wished to continue in business, and expressed his inability to give an opinion as to what amount a purchaser might have paid to obtain it, but said that if such a purchaser needed the property urgently he would advise him to pay ten per cent more than that figure. As to the position of the owner, however, he said that he would advise the Woods Manufacturing Company Limited not to accept such a figure since it could not hope to reinstate itself for that amount. Mr. Sherwood considered that at the relevant time he could have sold the property on the market for $315,000, but said that he would have advised the owner, assuming that it was intended to continue the business, to refuse such an amount \"or anything like it\". As to a prospective purchaser, assuming the property suited his requirements, he would have advised him to pay ten per cent in excess of this amount but would have advised the appellant to refuse such an offer. Mr. R. B. Moffit, the Vice-President and Comptroller of the appellant, said that in his opinion, having regard to the suitability of the plant for the operations and the profit realized, he would have advised against selling for less than $700,000.\nMr. A. B. Doran, a contractor with some twenty years' experience in building construction, estimated the cost of replacing the buildings on the property at $474,873 on the basis of the prices for material as of the date of the expropriation. The main building had been constructed in the year 1907 but had been very well maintained and he computed the depreciation at the sum of $94,631, expressed otherwise, he said that if his firm had been given the contract to rebuild the plant the new building would be worth about $95,000 more than the building as it stood in May of 1946.\nThe evidence for the Crown as to the reconstruction cost of the main and subsidiary buildings varied but little from that tendered by the owner. Mr. James Adam, an architect and civil engineer of long experience, estimated the cost of replacement at $478,032 and this figure was accepted by the learned President. While declining to estimate the probable future useful life of the building, he considered that since its erection it had deteriorated in the neighbourhood of thirty-five per cent. Mr. J. A. Coote, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at McGill University, and a consultant for a firm of engineers in Montreal, had examined the buildings at the request of the Crown. Accepting the reconstruction cost at the amount of the estimate of Mr. Adam and others employed for the purpose by the Crown, he considered that the depreciated value of all the buildings was $287,736. Mr. Coote had never constructed or tendered on the construction of a building and, admittedly, did not have experience with industrial plants of the kind operated by the company and his evidence as to the extent of the accumulated depreciation and of the future useful life of the building appears to have been based upon theories expressed by others on the subject. When counsel for the Crown directed questions to him to establish his qualifications as an expert on the question of depreciation, he said that he had been studying the theory for twenty-five years, that he had lectured to students in accounting and engineering and had read widely on the subject and considered that a useful life of sixty years was the utmost that could be assigned to the main building. He, however, also said that although the building was practically forty years old in 1946 it was as a structure in excellent condition, that it was an \"extra good building\", well constructed and in general very well maintained, and then said in part:\nThe question is: how many more years is it good for? Now nobody can tell, sir; I want to agree with the sentiment expressed here yesterday that nobody can tell how long a building is good for.\na statement which he repeated later, saying that \"nobody knows what the useful life of that building is going to be\". On cross-examination, when asked his opinion as to what condition the building would be in when it had reached sixty years of age, he said that:\nAs a structure, I should say it would probably be pretty fair.\nbut that the maintenance cost then would be much higher and that obsolescence would become an increasingly important factor. He did not say, however, that it would cease to be an effective building for the company's purposes at that time. In answer to a question by the learned trial judge he made it clear that his opinion on this point was not based upon his own experience, saying that he wished to emphasize that nobody could tell what conditon the building was going to be in at age sixty but that:\nrelying upon recorded experience, the experience of other people with buildings of that age, I say that I could not honestly give this building as a piece of productive equipment a life beyond sixty years.\nIt will be observed that expressed in percentages the depreciation in the main building in the opinion of Mr. Coote was 43.8 per cent, in that of Mr. Adam 35 per cent, and in that of Mr. Doran 22.3 per cent. There appears to be considerable support for the appellant's submission that the learned President was in error in placing the depreciation at the highest of these figures, in view of Mr. Coote's admission that his whole calculation was based on the assumption that the useful life of the building was limited to sixty years.\nFor the Crown the evidence, in so far as it related to the buildings as distinct from the land, was limited to the cost of replacing them. Replacement cost is, of course, a material factor for consideration in determining the value to the owner. In some circumstances it may well represent that value while in others it may greatly exceed it or be materially less. In the present case we are satisfied upon the evidence that the value of the property to the owner was in excess of the value of the land, plus the depreciated value of the buildings. In endeavouring to come to a conclusion as to what amount the owner, presumably directed by prudent business men, would have been prepared to pay for the property in May 1946 rather than to be forced to give up title and possession, the situation in the business world at that time is to be considered. The second World War had terminated and in consumers' goods of all kinds there existed what is commonly described as a seller's market, due to various factors including accumulated shortages during the war. The Woods Manufacturing Company during the years 1940 to 1945 both inclusive had made an average annual operating profit before income taxes in their Hull plant slightly in excess of $213,000. As there were available then no suitable factory buildings in Ottawa or Hull or the vicinity, and the company, if it was to continue in business, was faced with the necessity of constructing new suitable buildings on an appropriate site, there can be no doubt in our opinion, that had the buildings now under consideration then been situated on a site one or two miles down the Ottawa River and available for purchase at the depreciated value of the buildings, plus the value of the site, the company would have purchased without hesitation. To fail to do so under such circumstances would indicate a lack of ordinary business judgment. A substantial further value to the owner is to be attributed to being permitted to remain in undisturbed possession of its property in Hull, with its added advantage of immediate proximity to an adequate labour supply.\nThe learned President has allowed only the bare value of the land, the lowest depreciated value placed upon the building by any witness and a portion of the proven claim for disturbance. He has declined to consider the value to the owner as distinguished from the market value or to allow 10 per cent, or any amount, for compulsory taking. We are all of opinion that on the evidence the amount awarded is clearly inadequate. The amount to which the appellant is entitled cannot be determined with mathematical accuracy. Keeping in mind the principles stated above and after a careful consideration of all the evidence we are of opinion that the amount of compensation for the property secondly expropriated inclusive of any allowance for compulsory taking should be fixed at the sum of $450,000.\nThere is this to be added. It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the authority of decisions be scrupulously respected by all courts upon which they are binding. Without this uniform and consistent adherence the administration of justice becomes disordered, the law becomes uncertain, and the confidence of the public in it undermined. Nothing is more important than that the law as pronounced, including the interpretation by this Court of the decisions of the Judicial Committee, should be accepted and applied as our tradition requires; and even at the risk of that fallibility to which all judges are liable, we must maintain the complete integrity of relationship between the courts. If the rules in question are to be accorded any further examination or review, it must come either from this Court or from the Judicial Committee. The appeal will be allowed with costs. The amount of compensation for the property first expropriated will be fixed at $48,880 with interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum from the 19th of May, 1944. The amount of compensation for the property secondly expropriated will be fixed at $450,000 without interest.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gowling, MacTavish, Watt, Osborne and Henderson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

Entre autres motifs, elle invoque que l'avis d'action re\u00e7u est, en regard des prescriptions de l'article 622 de la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes la r\u00e9gissant, insuffisant et nul. Cette exception a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance dont le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire de la Cour du Banc du Roi si\u00e9geant en appel 2. Le pr\u00e9sent appel est de ce dernier jugement.\nAu cours de sa plaidoirie, limit\u00e9e devant nous \u00e0 l'insuffisance de l'avis, le savant procureur de l'appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9, vu la nature des faits invoqu\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9claration, invit\u00e9 par cette Cour \u00e0 argumenter sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de l'avis d'action en l'esp\u00e8ce. Les parties ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues sur ce point, la Cour a conclu \u00e0 la non n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de l'avis et indiquant que les raisons \u00e9crites de ce jugement seraient donn\u00e9es ult\u00e9rieurement, a rejet\u00e9 l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nPar son action, l'intim\u00e9e, Triangle Lumber, all\u00e8gue en substance les faits suivants: Le 28 juin 1946, un incendie \u00e9clatait en son \u00e9tablissement sis en la paroisse de Maski-nong\u00e9, district de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. Sur communication imm\u00e9diate avec le d\u00e9partement des incendies de la Ville de Louiseville, situ\u00e9e \u00e0 environ un mille du moulin de l'intim\u00e9e, le g\u00e9rant de la compagnie obtint la venue des membres de cette brigade. Les appareils pour combattre l'incendie \u00e9tant arriv\u00e9s et sur le point d'\u00eatre mis en op\u00e9ration, le maire de la ville de Louiseville intervint et ordonna instanter le retour de la brigade \u00e0 Louiseville. Le g\u00e9rant de l'intim\u00e9e dut alors se mettre en communication avec les autorit\u00e9s de la ville de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, lesquelles envoy\u00e8rent le secours demand\u00e9. Dans l'intervalle, cependant, l'incendie et les dommages en r\u00e9sultant firent du progr\u00e8s. Bref, et invoquant l'inex\u00e9cution de l'entente arr\u00eat\u00e9e au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone entre son g\u00e9rant et les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s au d\u00e9partement d'incendie de la Ville de Louiseville, la Triangle Lumber Company demande une compensation pour dommages faits \u00e0 sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mobili\u00e8re et immobili\u00e8re, aussi bien que pour perte de profits cons\u00e9quente \u00e0 la cessation des op\u00e9rations pendant la p\u00e9riode de reconstruction. Nous n'avons pas \u00e0 nous prononcer sur le m\u00e9rite de cette action. Il s'agit tout simplement de savoir si les dispositions de l'article 622, faisant de l'avis d'action une condition au droit d'action, sont applicables \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce.\nIl faut, d\u00e8s maintenant, observer que les dommages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s ne r\u00e9sultent pas d'un accident et qu'en tant que l'appelante est concern\u00e9e, l'action repose sur l'inex\u00e9cution de l'entente intervenue entre le g\u00e9rant de la compagnie et certains repr\u00e9sentants de la ville de Louiseville. Il est \u00e0 propos, m\u00eame si non n\u00e9cessaire ici, pour fins d'interpr\u00e9tation, de rappeler que les dispositions de l'article 622 sont exorbitantes du droit commun. Sur ce point, r\u00e9f\u00e9rence peut \u00eatre faite \u00e0 la cause de The City of Quebec v. The United Typewriter Company 3, et \u00e0 la cause de The City of Quebec v. Boucher 4. Dans la premi\u00e8re, M. le juge Brodeur \u00e0 la page 246, s'exprime ainsi:\nLa jurisprudence est \u00e0 l'effet que ces avis constituent une exception aux r\u00e8gles ordinaires qui r\u00e9gissent les personnes dans leurs relations entre elles et, alors, ils ne doivent \u00eatre donn\u00e9s que dans les cas qui tombent clairement sous les dispositions du statut. Robin v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al 5; Newman v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al 6; Del Sole v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al 7; Qu\u00e9bec v. Bastien8.\nDans la seconde, le pr\u00e9sent Juge en chef de la Cour d'Appel de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, avec la concurrence de Sir Mathias Tellier, des juges Dorion, Bond et Barclay, dit, \u00e0 la page 157:\nIl faut donc interpr\u00e9ter strictement ces dispositions de la charte de l'appelante.\nOn ne saurait, tout en tenant compte des dispositions de l'article 41 de la loi concernant les statuts, S.R.Q., 1941, c. 1, \u00e9tendre l'application des dispositions de l'article 622 \u00e0 d'autres cas qu'\u00e0 ceux qui y sont nettement pourvus.\nLe paragraphe premier de cet article se lit comme suit:\nSi une personne pr\u00e9tend s'\u00eatre inflig\u00e9, par suite d'un accident, dcs blessures corporelles, pour lesquelles elle se propose de r\u00e9clamer de la municipalit\u00e9 des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, elle doit,......donner un avis \u00e9crit ...................., faute de quoi la municipalit\u00e9 n'est pas tenue \u00e0 des dom mages-int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 raison de tel accident, nonobstant toute disposition de la loi \u00e0 ce contraire. Il est clair que ce premier paragraphe ne vise qu'une r\u00e9clamation pour blessures corporelles r\u00e9sultant d'un accident.\nLe deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe:\nDans le cas de r\u00e9clamation pour dommages \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mobili\u00e8re ou immobili\u00e8re, un avis semblable doit aussi \u00eatre donn\u00e9...................faute de quoi la municipalit\u00e9 n'est pas tenue de payer des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, nonobstant toute disposition de la loi.\nLe premier paragraphe vise une r\u00e9clamation pour dommages \u00e0 la personne et le second une r\u00e9clamation pour dommages \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mobili\u00e8re ou immobili\u00e8re. Dans le premier paragraphe, il appert clairement que la r\u00e9clamation se fonde sur un accident. Dans le second paragraphe, aucune indication n'est donn\u00e9e sur la cause du dommage. En l'absence de pr\u00e9cision et lisant le paragraphe 2 avec le paragraphe 1, il faut inf\u00e9rer qu'il s'agit d'un dommage caus\u00e9 \"par suite d'un accident\".\nLes autres dispositions de l'article 622 confirment, je crois, la justesse de cette inference.\nLe paragraphe 4 \u00e9dicte:\nLe d\u00e9faut de donner l'avis ci-dessus\u2014soit l'avis requis au paragraphe 2 aussi bien qu'au paragraphe 1, le l\u00e9gislateur ne distingue pas\u2014ne prive pas cependant la personne victime d'un accident de son droit d'action, si elle prouve qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9e de donner cet avis pour des raisons jug\u00e9es suffisantes par le juge ou par le tribunal.\nOn a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que l'excuse du d\u00e9faut d'avis,\u2014d\u00e9faut r\u00e9sultant d'un cas de force majeure, par exemple,\u2014n'est reconnue que dans le cas d'une r\u00e9clamation pour dommages \u00e0 la personne et non dans celui d'une r\u00e9clamation pour dommages \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mobili\u00e8re ou immobili\u00e8re. L'acceptation de cette suggestion conduirait aux r\u00e9sultats suivants. Ainsi, \u00e0 la suite d'une collision d'automobiles, une personne subit des dommages \u00e0 la personne, et subit la perte de sa voiture. On excuserait, les faits le justifiant, son d\u00e9faut d'avis en ce qui concerne sa r\u00e9clamation pour dommages r\u00e9sultant de blessures corporelles et on ne l'excuserait pas en ce qui concerne sa r\u00e9clamation pour perte de sa voiture. Ou encore, un v\u00e9hicule du service des incendies entre en collision avec la voiture d'un tiers et va se heurter sur l'immeuble d'un autre. Le propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble n'apprend ce fait qu'\u00e0 un retour de voyage et pour cette raison, ou autres jug\u00e9es suffisantes par le juge, est emp\u00each\u00e9 de donner l'avis en temps opportun. Comment se justifier, sans un texte clair \u00e0 cet effet, de lui enlever le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'excuse prescrit par le l\u00e9gislateur pour temp\u00e9rer la rigueur de. ces dispositions exorbitantes du droit commun.\nLes dispositions du paragraphe 5 r\u00e9f\u00e8re encore au fait d'un accident:\nAucune action en r\u00e9clamation de dommages n'est recevable \u00e0 moins qu'elle ne soit intent\u00e9e dans les six mois qui suivent le jour o\u00f9 l'accident est arriv\u00e9, ou le jour o\u00f9 le droit d'action a pris naissance.\nEnfin, le paragraphe 6 prescrit:\nLa municipalit\u00e9 a un recours en garantie contre toute personne dont la faute ou la n\u00e9gligence a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause de l'accident et des dommages qui en r\u00e9sultent.\nLe recours en garantie existe aussi bien pour tous les dommages que la municipalit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9e \u00e0 payer, qu'ils soient de la nature de ceux mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe 1 ou de la nature de ceux mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe 2. Les dispositions du paragraphe 6 confirment que les premiers comme les seconds r\u00e9sultent d'un accident.\nPrises, dans leur ensemble, ces dispositions de l'article 622 ne s'appliquent donc que s'il y a eu accident, suivant l'acceptation ordinaire du mot.\nLa comparaison entre ces dispositions de l'article 622 et celles de l'article 623\u2014lesquelles \u00e9tablissent une prescription de six mois pour r\u00e9clamation de dommages r\u00e9sultant de d\u00e9lits, quasi-d\u00e9lits, ou d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9s\u2014sugg\u00e8re que le champ d'application des dispositions de l'article 622 est plus restreint que celui des dispositions de l'article 623. Le premier vise bien un cas, mais pas tous les cas, de quasi-d\u00e9lits, comme le fait le second. Dans le premier, il faut que ce quasi-d\u00e9lit soit un accident, alors que, dans le second, le L\u00e9gislateur embrasse toutes les formes de quasi-d\u00e9lits. Dans la cause de The City of Quebec v. United Typewriter 9, M. le juge Mignault, \u00e0 la page 251, ana- lysant la l\u00e9gislation pertinente \u00e0 cette cause, note la distinction entre le mot \"accident\", et l'expression \"fait dommageable\".\nCette derni\u00e8re expression, dit-il, est sans doute plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et com- prendrait probablement\u2014mais pour les fins de cete cause il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de le d\u00e9cider formellement\u2014une cause de dommages que l'on pourrait distinguer d'un pur accident.\nDans la cause de Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec v. Boucher 10, Boucher poursuivait la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec pour dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour $500, pour ennuis et inconv\u00e9nients provenant d'une \u00e9table appartenant \u00e0 la demanderesse et des mati\u00e8res qu'on y laissait s\u00e9journer aux alentours. Au temps de l'action, l'article 535 de la charte de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e9tait en substance, sur le point qui nous int\u00e9resse, comparable \u00e0 l'article 622. La Cour d'Appel a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'avis n'\u00e9tait pas exig\u00e9. Et on ajoute \u00e0 la page 157:\nC'est ainsi que la cit\u00e9 ne pourrait exiger semblable avis si elle \u00e9tait poursuivie en vertu d'un contrait, ou dans tous les autres cas non pr\u00e9vus. Aucun avis ne para\u00eet \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire lorsqu'il s'agit de d\u00e9lits, ou quasi-d\u00e9lits, ou d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9s mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 538 de la charte.\nDans la m\u00eame cause, on peut remarquer que la Cour d\u00e9cide aussi que, les dommages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s n'\u00e9tant pas des dommages \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re, mais simplement pour ennuis caus\u00e9s au demandeur et \u00e0 sa famille, l'avis pour r\u00e9clamation pour pareils dommages n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire.\nDans la cause de McConmey v. City of Coaticook 11, cette Cour n'avait pas \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si le paragraphe 2 de l'article 622 ne visait\u2014comme le paragraphe 1 du m\u00eame article\u2014que des dommages r\u00e9sultant d'un accident. Mais le jugement rendu supporte, je crois, la proposition que les deux dispositions ne s'\u00e9tendent pas aux r\u00e9clamations de dommages r\u00e9sultant de l'inex\u00e9cution d'un contrat.\nLes dommages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s de l'appelante n'ayant pas, suivant les all\u00e9gations de la d\u00e9claration, \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s par suite d'un accident, mais \u00e9tant plut\u00f4t le r\u00e9sultat de l'inex\u00e9cution d'un contrat all\u00e9gu\u00e9, il n'y avait pas lieu pour l'intim\u00e9e de donner un avis d'action \u00e0 l'appelante. Pour cette raison, tel que d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, l'appel est renvoy\u00e9; avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

APPEALS from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] quashing the conviction of each of the respondents on the charge of being a habitual criminal.\nH. A. Maclean K.C. for the appellant.\nT. F. Hurley and R. A. Reid for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014The nature and the course of proceedings, eventually leading to these four separate appeals, are substantially alike in all of the cases. Each of the respondents was separately indicted on two counts: one being that, at some definite time in 1950, in the province of British Columbia, he was found in unlawful possession of drugs, under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act 1929 as amended, and the second one charging him to be a habitual criminal within the meaning of the provisions of Part X(A) of the Criminal Code of Canada. The first count\u2014which is not relevant to the point raised in the present appeal\u2014was either admitted by the accused or found by the jury. As to the second count, the accused pleaded not guilty but were found guilty by the jury. An appeal, subsequently lodged against the latter conviction, was unanimously maintained by the Court of Appeal of the province[2] , which quashed the conviction and directed a verdict of acquittal to be entered thereon. Identical in all of the cases, the judgment rests on the interpretation of the provisions of section 575(c) (1) (a) of Part X(A). On this point, and under the authority of section 1025 of the Criminal Code, leave to appeal to this Court was granted to the appellant.\nIt was agreed by counsel of all interested parties that the argument made in the appeal of His Majesty the King v. Gordon Robinson or Robertson\u2014the first being called for hearing\u2014would apply in all the other cases.\nThe opposing contentions of the parties, which are now to be considered, may more clearly be stated once the relevant part of section 575(c) is quoted:\nA person shall not be found to be a habitual criminal unless the judge or jury as the case may be, finds on evidence, (a) that since attaining the age of eighteen years he has at least three times previously to the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment, been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to at least five years' imprisonment, whether any such previous conviction was before or after the commencement of this Part, and that he is leading persistently a criminal life; or\nThe submission of respondent, which prevailed in the Court of Appeal, rests on an argument, centered solely on the meaning of the words \"at least\"\u2014twice appearing in the above provision\u2014and purporting to implement the rule of literal interpretation. In both instances the words are said to mean \"not less than\". \"Not less than\"\u2014it may be pointed out\u2014is the qualifying phrase used by Parliament in relation to minimum mandatory sentences, which are few in number. Paraphrasing the relevant part of the provision, in a manner strictly consistent with the submission made, the provision would read: \"A person shall not be found to be a habitual criminal unless it is found on the evidence that, since attaining the age of eighteen years, he has not less than three times, previously to the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment, been convicted of an indictable offence for which the minimum mandatory punishment enacted is not less than five years' imprisonment.\" In this category, it may immediately be noted, there is only one offence in the Criminal Code. The offence is dealt with in section 449:\u2014Stopping the mail with intent to rob.\nIn the appellant's view, the words \"at least\", in the context, mean \"as much as\" and the questioned part of the provision should read: \"\u2026 unless\u2026 he has\u2026 been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable or exposed to suffer as much as five years' imprisonment.\" Thus, it is said, that, in the context\u2014and not detached therefrom\u2014these words are indicative of a minimum manifestly related to the maximum number of years of imprisonment which the offender is liable or exposed to suffer as punishment. There are, in the Criminal Code, some one hundred and eighty indictable offences for which the offender is liable to receive as a maximum punishment a sentence of at least five years' imprisonment.\nThe will of Parliament is well manifested by the provisions of Part X(A) and the words \"at least\", when read in the context, are, in my respectful view, quite inapt to defeat the primary as well as incidental purposes of this Part.\nPart X(A) is new in our Criminal Code. Enacted in 1947, by section 18 of the Criminal Code Amendment Act, chapter 35, its provisions may be traced to Part II of the English Act assented to on December 21, 1908, being 8 Edward VII Ch. 59, the unabridged title of which is: \"An Act to make better provision for the prevention of crime and for that purpose to provide for the reformation of young offenders and the prolonged detention of habitual criminals and for other purposes incidental thereto.\"\nThe primary purpose of Part X(A) is best indicated by the following underlined words of section 575(b):\u2014\nWhere a person is convicted of an indictable offence committed after the commencement of this Part and subsequently the offender admits that he is or is found by a jury or a judge to be a habitual criminal, and the court passes a sentence upon the said offender, the court, if it is of the opinion that, by reason of his criminal habits and mode of life, it is expedient for the protection of the public, may pass a further sentence ordering that he be detained in a prison for an indeterminate period and such detention is hereinafter referred to as preventive detention and the person on whom such a sentence is passed shall be deemed for the purpose of this Part to be a habitual criminal.\nIt is equally provided\u2014by section 575 (g)\u2014that persons undergoing preventive detention may be confined in a prison or part of a prison set apart for that purpose, to be subjected to such disciplinary and reformative treatment as may be prescribed by the prison regulations. In brief, the provisions of Part X(A) are clearly directed to persons who, by reason of \"criminal habits and mode of life\", must, for the protection of the public, be subjected to preventive detention, for an indeterminate period. It is left to the Minister of Justice to \"review the condition, history and circumstances of that person\u2014once at least in every three years\u2014with a view to determining whether the person should be placed out on license, and if so, on what conditions (s. 575 (h)).\nWhat the Legislature considers as being tantamount to \"criminal habits and mode of life justifying preventive detention for the protection of the public\", is indicated in the provisions of secton 575 (c) where a minimum requirement, expressed in the form of several conditions, is estab- lished. Three of the conditions which must be found on the evidence, before a person can be branded and dealt with as a habitual criminal, are that :\n(1) Since attaining the age of eighteen years\n(2) he has, at least three times previously to the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment, been convicted of an indictable offence\n(3) that is, not any indictable offence but an indictable offence for the commission of which the offender is liable to at least five years' imprisonment.\nThe corresponding section in the English Act is section 10, which, in substance, prescribes that:\n(1) Since attaining the age of sixteen\n(2) he has, at least three times previously to the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment, been convicted of a crime.\n(3) which, according to ss. 6 of section 10, comes within the definition of a crime as precised under the Prevention of Crimes Act, 1871.\nThus, and under both Acts, it is not the repeated commission of all kinds of offences which may cause an offender to be found a habitual criminal. It is only the repeated commission of such offences which are therein indicated. While such indication is, under section 20 of the Prevention of Crimes Act, 1871, achieved by various ways, only one method to that end is used in Part X(A). The offences are not identified by names or by reference to sections describing them, but by the measure of punishment or, more precisely, by the maximum punishment which the offender is exposed to suffer. And only those crimes for which the authorized maximum punishment is at least five years' imprisonment come within the purview of Part X(A). Again, in such category, there are, in the Criminal Code, some one hundred and eighty crimes while there is only the crime described in section 449 for which the minimum mandatory sentence prescribed is five years' imprisonment. If the appellant's submission is right, these one hundred and eighty indictable offences are within the purview of Part X(A) which may then, and for that reason, receive as general an application as the generality of the above quoted provisions suggest it should. If, on the contrary, the submission of the respondents is accepted, Part X(A) is inapplicable in the case of these one hundred and eighty indictable offences and applicable only to the one indictable offence defined in section 449.\nThat Parliament would have, in 1947, enacted all the provisions of Part X(A), and would further, by incorporating it in the Criminal Code, have extended\u2014by force of section 28 of the Interpretation Act\u2014its application to other federal statutes where indictable offences are created, with the sole object of dealing exclusively with the now uncommon offence of stopping the mail with intent to rob or search, is clearly untenable.\nCan the intent of Parliament, manifested by the above quoted provisions, be defeated on the alleged ground of ambiguity or intractability of the language adopted by Parliament in the following phrase of subsection (1) (a) of section 575(c) \"for which he was liable to at least five years' imprisonment\"?\n\"It is quite true\", says one of the learned members of the Court of Appeal, \"that when one reads the subsection for the first time, the effect of the intractability of the language may not be at once apparent; the dominant impression may be that it simply excludes from its operation offences which do not merit imprisonment for five years or more. But a check on this thinking reveals one cannot fix a maximum of this kind if there is no minimum; the point at which the maximum starts automatically fixes the minimum.\" With this line of reasoning one cannot disagree provided, in my respectful view, both the minimum and the maximum are related to the same type of sentence. However that may be, this reasoning does not solve the question for, in the appellant's submission, the phrase \"for which he was liable to at least five years' imprisonment\" is related to the first kind of sentence above indicated and means \"for which the authorized discretionary sentence is at least five years\" while, in the respondents' view, it refers to the second kind of sentence and means \"for which the mandatory sentence is at least five years\". It thus becomes apparent that the controlling word in the phrase is really the word \"liable\", and that the meaning of this word, in the ordinary language as well as under the Code, must then be ascertained to decide the issue. Of the various imports ascribed to the word \"liable\" in The Oxford English Dictionary, vol. VI, p. 234, the following are indicated: \"Exposed, or subject to, or likely to suffer\". Under the Code, the provisions of section 1054 make it clear that Parliament has given to the word \"liable\" a like practical significance. For this section reads:\nEvery one who is liable to imprisonment for life, or for any term of years, or other term, may be sentenced to imprisonment for any shorter term: Provided that no one shall be sentenced to any shorter term of imprisonment than the minimum term, if any, prescribed for the offence of which he is convicted.\nThe opening words of this section: \"Every one who is liable\u2026\" are clearly in reference to similar words used by Parliament in the pattern generally followed in the prescription of punishment, as illustrated in the following section :\nEvery one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to seven years' imprisonment who breaks and enters any place of public worship, with intent to commit any indictable offence therein.\n(s. 456).\nThe words \"liable to seven years' imprisonment\" in section 456, read in the light of the provisions of section 1054, necessarily indicate an authorized but not a mandatory term of imprisonment. And the words \"for which he was liable \u2026\", in the new enactment\u2014section 575(c)\u2014can only be related to similar words used in the general pattern and must, thus, be presumed to be understood in the same sense. The fact that the opposite view would entirely defeat what the above quoted provisions of Part X(A) indicate as its clear object, is no reason to nullify the presumption. That the word \"liable\" appears in few provisions\u2014some ten sections under the Code\u2014where, by exception, a mandatory term is prescribed, is of no avail as an argument against the above conclusion, for the word \"liable\", in its proper sense, is there equally related to the maximum authorized sentence to which the minimum mandatory term is attached. It is also of some significance that in section 263, dealing with the predetermined mandatory punishment for murder, the word \"liable\" is not used.\nIn my respectful view, the submission of the respondents cannot rest, as alleged, on the rule of literal construction. As to the application of the narrow construction doctrine, in the construction of penal statutes, this may be said. The matter, in England, is deal with in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 9th Edition, 1946, p. 267, in the following terms:\nThe rule which requires that penal and some other statutes shall be construed strictly was more rigorously applied in former times when the number of capital offences was very large (a), when it was still punishable with death to cut down a cherry-tree in an orchard, or to be seen for a month in the company of gipsies (b), or for a soldier or sailor to beg and wander without a pass. Invoked in the majority of cases in favorem vitae, it has lost much of its force and importance in recent times, and it is now recognized that the paramount duty of the judicial interpreter is to put upon the language of the Legislature, honestly and faithfully, its plain and rational meaning and to promote its object.\nIn Canada, section 15 of the Interpretation Act disposes of all discussion in the premises. This section, by force of section 2, extends and applies to the Criminal Code and the following words in section 15 \"or to prevent or punish the doing of anything which it deems contrary to the public good\" make it clear that its provisions embrace penal as well as civil statutory provisions in any Canadian statute except if there is inconsistency or a declaration of inapplicability.\nThe appeal of His Majesty against each of the four respondents should be maintained, and the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be quashed. This conclusion, however, does not bring these cases to an end, for there were, before the Court of Appeal, other points besides the one discussed herein on which the respondents are entitled to have an adjudication. Adopting the course followed in The King v. Deur[3] , and The King v. Boak[4] , the cases should be remitted to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in order that it may pass upon these other grounds of appeal.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock and Locke, JJ. was delivered by:\nLOCKE J.:\u2014The contention of the Crown is that while the words \"at least\", where they first appear in subsection (a) of section 575C(1) of the Criminal Code, are to be construed as meaning \"not less than\", where they again appear following the words \"liable to\", they are to be taken as meaning \"as much as\". Thus, if the respondents were shown to have been convicted three times or more of criminal offences for which the maximum permissible punishment was five years' imprisonment or more, this condition of the section would be complied with. The Court of Appeal[5] , has unanimously rejected this contention, the learned judges all being of the opinion that in the context the expression should be construed, where used for the second time, in the same manner as when first used.\nSince no mention is made of section 15 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 1, in the reasons for the judgment appealed from or in the factum of either party, I judge that it was not argued in the Court of Appeal that the rules of statutory construction prescribed by that section were to be applied. Mr. Justice O'Halloran refers to the common law rules of construction but, while the result may not be affected, I am of the opinion that it is to the statute we must look. Section 15 reads:\nEvery Act and every provision and enactment thereof, shall be deemed remedial, whether its immediate purport is to direct the doing of any thing which Parliament deems to be for the public good, or to prevent or punish the doing of any thing which it deems contrary to the public good; and shall accordingly receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act and of such provision or enactment, according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.\nThis section appears to have had its origin in section 5 of c. 10, Statutes of Canada 1849 which was, with minor differences which do not affect the meaning, expressed in the same terms. It was reproduced in substantially the same form in section 6 of c. 5 Consolidated Statutes of Canada 1859 and appeared as the 39th paragraph of section 7 of the Interpretation Act, passed at the First Session of the Parliament of Canada in 1867, and has been continued in language identical in meaning up to the present time. Section 3 of the Act as passed in 1867 provided that section 7 and each provision thereof should extend and apply to every Act passed in the session held in that year and in any future session of the Parliament of Canada, except in so far as the provision was inconsistent with the intent and object of the Act or the interpretation which such provision would give to any word, expression or clause inconsistent with the context and except in so far as any provision thereof in any such Act is declared not applicable thereto. Section 2 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 1, declared that the Act and every provision thereof should extend and apply to every Act of the Parliament of Canada then or thereafter passed, with the like exceptions, and the legislation was in this state when the Criminal Code was first enacted in 1892. Section 2 of the present Act is in like terms and its application does not, in my opinion, restrict in any way the application of section 15 to the language here to be construed.\nSection 15 appears to me to be substantially a restatement of the rules for the construction of statutes contained in the Resolutions of the Barons in Heydon's Case[6] . While in Attorney General v. Sillem[7] , Pollock, C.B. said (p. 509) said that the rules of construction there stated were not to be applied to a criminal statute which creates a new offence, this argument is not available here to the respondents since the matter has been dealt with by statute. The offence of being a habitual criminal is new to our law. Clearly the language employed in defining it is capable of the construction contended for by the respondents. This, if adopted, would lead to the result that, unless the three offences or more proven against them were such that the minimum permissible punishment was five years' imprisonment, they were entitled to be acquitted. In re National Savings Bank Association[8] , Turner, L.J. dealing with the construction of a clause in the Companies Act 1862, said that he did not consider it would be consistent with the law or with the course of the Court to put a different construction upon the same words in different parts of an Act of Parliament, without finding some very clear reason for doing so. There are dicta to the same effect by Cleasby, B. in Courtauld v. Legh[9] , and by Chitty, J. in Spencer v. Metropolitan Board of Works[10] . In the present matter the clear indication that the words \"at least\" are to be construed as meaning something else than \"not less than\", where used the second time, must be found if at all in their association with the word \"liable\" and it is really the sense in which the latter word is to be understood in the context that determines the matter.\nIn my opinion, the requirement that statutes and their provisions are to be deemed remedial and that they shall accordingly receive \"such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation\" as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act does not mean that the object of the Act is not to be clearly manifest from the language employed. The object of these amendments to the Criminal Code is to be ascertained by determining the identity of the persons against whom they are directed. In accordance with the canons for the interpretation of statutes the Act as a whole may be examined as an aid to the construction of the language of the amending sections. As appears from section 575B the legislation is designed for the protection of the public against the danger inherent in permitting habitual criminals being at large. While in sections 122, 364, 377, 449, 510A, 542 and 1054A, minimum terms of imprisonment are provided for the offences defined, in but one of these, section 449, is the minimum permissible term five years, and in none other is it more than this. In sections 122, 364, 449 and 510A the language is that the guilty person is \"liable to imprisonment for a term not less than.\" In 14 sections of the Code where the prescribed punishment is or includes a fine and a minimum is prescribed the words used are also \"not less than.\" In none of the sections is the minimum permissible term of imprisonment or fine expressed by employing the expression \"at least\". Where, however, only the maximum punishment by way of imprisonment which may be imposed is to be expressed, this has been done in at least 260 other sections of the Code by saying that the guilty person is \"liable to\" a penalty, leaving it to the operation of section 1054, which provides that anyone liable to imprisonment for life or any other term may be sentenced to imprisonment for any shorter term except where a minimum term is prescribed, to enable the Court to impose imprisonment for any lesser term. While in some 35 other sections of the Code the maximum term of imprisonment is defined by saying that it shall be for a term \"not exceeding\" or \"not more than\" a stated period, this appears unnecessary in view of the provisions of section 1054.\nThe persons to whom the habitual criminal sections of the Criminal Code are applicable are, if the respondents' contention be accepted, only those who have on three occasions or more been convicted of offences against section 449, dealing with the offence of stopping a mail with intent to rob or search the same, and presumably such other offences for which there may hereafter be prescribed a minimum term of five years' imprisonment. Construing the subsection in the manner contended for by the Crown means that conviction on three or more occasions of any of the many other offences described in the Code for which the maximum imprisonment might be five years or more would comply with the subsection. The language of section 575B is that where a person is convicted of an indictable offence committed after the commencement of the Part and subsequently admits that he is, or is found by a jury or a judge, to be a habitual criminal:\nthe Court, if it is of the opinion that by reason of his criminal habits and mode of life it is expedient for the protection of the public, may pass a further sentence ordering that he be detained in a prison for an indeterminate period.\nIt is habitual criminals as a class against whom the public are to be protected. The words \"liable to\", with the noted exceptions, being used throughout the Code to indicate the maximum sentences which may be imposed, the expression \"liable to at least\" in subsection 575C(1), in my opinion, conveys, and was intended to convey, the meaning contended for by the Crown. It is inconceivable to me that these new sections of the Code were directed against the very limited class of criminals who would be affected if the respondents' contention were correct. We are required by section 15 to interpret the subsection in such manner as will best ensure the attainment of its object according to its true intent, meaning and spirit, and to construe this language in this manner is, in my judgment, not to legislate but to comply with the directions of the statute.\nI would allow these appeals and refer each case back to the Court of Appeal, in order that the other grounds of appeal raised before that Court may be there dealt with. CARTWRIGHT J.\u2014The only question raised on this appeal is as to the proper interpretation of section 575C of the Criminal Code. This section is found in Part XA dealing with habitual criminals which was added to the Code in 1947 by 11 Geo. VI, c. 55, section 18.\nThe section, so far as it is relevant to this appeal, reads as follows:\n575C. (1) A person shall not be found to be a habitual criminal unless the judge or jury as the case may be, finds on evidence,\n(a) that since attaining the age of eighteen years, he has at least three times previously to the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment, been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to at least five years' imprisonment, whether any such previous conviction was before or after the commencement of this Part, and that he is leading persistently a criminal life; or \u2026\nThe controversy is as to the proper construction of the words \"been convicted of an offence for which he was liable to at least five years' imprisonment.\"\nThe respondent submits that these words, construed in their ordinary and natural meaning, describe an indictable offence as punishment for which the law prescribes a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment for at least five years. The appellant submits that they describe an indictable offence as punishment for which the maximum penalty permitted by the law is imprisonment for five years or more.\nThe solution of the question depends upon the meaning to be given to the words \"liable to\". Their ordinary and natural meaning is, I think, \"exposed to\". The intention of Parliament as disclosed in the words of the section seems to me to be to describe a class of indictable offences, and to require as one of the conditions of a person being found to be a habitual criminal that he shall at least three times have been convicted of an offence comprised in such class. The offences of which the class is composed are described by reference to the penalty which the law permits to be inflicted on a person convicted thereof, that is to say, the penalty to which he is exposed, which he runs the risk of suffering, which he is subject to the possibility of undergoing, not the penalty which he must suffer. Every indictable offence on conviction of which a person may lawfully is the permissible maximum and not a mandatory minimum. be sentenced to five years imprisonment or more is, I think, included in the class described and every indictable offence on conviction of which a person may not lawfully be sentenced to so long a term of imprisonment as five years is, I think, excluded.\nExpressing my view in different words, I think that the question an affirmative answer to which will determine that a particular indictable offence falls within the class described is: Does the law permit (not does the law require) the imposition on a person guilty of such offence of a term of imprisonment of as much as or more than five years?\nThe meaning which I ascribe to the word \"liable\" is given in the Oxford English Dictionary (1933) Volume VI, page 235. In Black's Law Dictionary, 3rd Edition (1933), page 1103, the meaning given is: \"Exposed or subject to a given contingency, risk or casualty which is more or less probable\". In In re Soltau's Trusts[11] , North J. agreeing with a decision of Stirling J. in an earlier case held that the expression \"is liable to be laid out in the purchase of land\" does not mean \"has to be laid out in the purchase of land\" but means \"subject to some disposition under which it may be laid out in the purchase of land\".\nIf the words of the section only were to be considered it would be my view that their natural meaning is that attributed to them by the appellant. We are not, however, limited to a consideration of the words of the section. In order to ascertain the intention of Parliament we must construe the statute as a whole and not one part only by itself. The great majority of the sections in the Criminal Code which define indictable offences and prescribe the penalties therefor are in the following form: \"Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to\u2014years' imprisonment who \u2026\". Section 1054 of the Code provides as follows:\n1054. Every one who is liable to imprisonment for life, or for any term of years, or other term, may be sentenced to imprisonment for any shorter term: Provided that no one shall be sentenced to any shorter term of imprisonment than the minimum term, if any, prescribed for the offence of which he is convicted.\nIn my opinion a consideration of such sections strengthens the view that the words \"liable to\" followed by a stated term of years' imprisonment mean that such term In so far as Parliament may be said to grade offences, in the Criminal Code, according to their seriousness it does so by fixing for each a permissible maximum sentence leaving it within the power and discretion of the Court, before which a person is convicted, to impose such lesser sentence as the particular circumstances may warrant, subject in the case of a few offences to a prescribed minimum. The words with which we are concerned appear to me to mean that no person shall be found to be a habitual criminal unless proved to have been convicted at least three times of an offence so serious that the permissible maximum sentence therefor is at least five years' imprisonment. They set a minimum in the field of permissible maxima.\nIt will next be observed that the Code contains only one offence, that described in section 449, for which a mandatory minimum sentence of as much as five years' imprisonment is prescribed. The words of a statute must be construed so as to give the statute a sensible meaning if possible. Here the construction for which the appellant contends gives the statute a sensible and effective meaning while that for which the respondent argues would render Part XA without effect.\nIn my opinion if the words of an enactment which is relied upon as creating a new offence are ambiguous, the ambiguity must be resolved in favour of the liberty of the subject, but whether or not such ambiguity exists is to be determined after calling in aid the rules of construction. I have reached the conclusion that the words of the section construed with the aid of the applicable rules, mentioned above, leave no room for doubt as to the intention of Parliament, and that such intention is that for which the appellant contends.\nI would allow this appeal and those in the cases of His Majesty the King v. McKenna, His Majesty the King v. Cuthbert and His Majesty the King v. Beatty which it was agreed should abide its result and refer each case back to the Court of Appeal so that the other grounds of appeal, raised in that Court, may be dealt with.\nAppeals allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.

Stevenson Hall for the appellant.\nH. A. Maclean K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau, Estey and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:\nESTEY J.:\u2014The appellant was convicted of having in his \"possession instruments for making paper intended to resemble the bill paper of a body corporate carrying on the business of banking, to wit, the Bank of America,\" contrary to the provisions of s. 471(a) of the Criminal Code. He was unsuccessful in his appeal to the Court of Appeal in British Columbia and obtained leave, under s. 1025 of the Criminal Code, to appeal to this Court.\nThe instruments in his possession enabled the accused to take a piece of white paper and make it into a Bank of America traveller's cheque. Counsel for the accused submits that such instruments are not included in s. 471(a). He would construe this subsection to include only those instruments which can be used for the manufacture of the bill paper from its original ingredients and not, therefore, to include the making of a piece of white paper into a bill paper intended to resemble the bill paper of the Bank of America. S. 471(a) reads:\n471. Everyone is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to fourteen years' imprisonment who, without lawful authority or excuse, the proof whereof shall lie on him,\n(a) makes, begins to make, uses or knowingly has in his possession, any machinery or instrument or material for making exchequer bill paper, revenue paper or paper intended to resemble the bill paper of any firm or body corporate, or person carrying on the business of banking ;\nThe foregoing s. 471 follows in the statute immediately after those dealing with the offence of forgery and is included with those sections under the heading \"Forgery and Preparation Therefor.\" It is specifically directed against the preparation for a forged bill and makes it an offence to be in possession of instruments, without lawful authority or excuse, that may be used \"for making\u2026 paper intended to resemble the bill paper of any firm or body corporate, or person carrying on the business of banking.\"\nWhile \"exchequer bill paper\" is defined in s. 335(k), bill paper generally, or that of a firm or body corporate or person carrying on the business of banking, is not defined, no doubt because each of these bodies selects its own particular bill paper. The Bank of America, in making its traveller's cheques, used specially designed paper. The acquisition or making of paper to resemble the bill paper of the Bank of America would be a step toward, or in preparation of, a completed forgery of its traveller's cheques. The accused was found to have in his possession instruments with which he fashioned or changed a piece of white paper, by impressions or other means, with intent that it would resemble the bill paper upon which these traveller's cheques were made. It is the possession of such instruments without lawful authority or excuse that the section makes an offence.\nThe submission that, because the instruments which were in the possession of the accused could not manufacture bill paper which would resemble that of the Bank of America from its original ingredients, but could only fashion or change white paper as already indicated, the accused, in having them in his possession without lawful excuse, had not committed an offence contrary to s. 471 (a) is not tenable. The words \"making\" and \"manufacturing\" are sometimes used synonymously. The word \"making\" is, however, a wider term and somewhat more inclusive. The mere physical fashioning or changing of a given commodity might, in some circumstances, be described as manufacturing, but, in any event, it is a making. The instruments in the possession of the accused enabled him to do just that. He fashioned or changed the white paper with these instruments and made it into that which he intended would resemble the bill paper of the Bank of America. The language of this section cannot be given the narrow construction suggested by counsel for the accused.\nCounsel for the accused supported his suggested construction of s. 471(a) by reference to a number of cases which were decided under the language of particular statutes and which, therefore, do not materially assist in the construction of the section here in question. In one of the more recent, Gamble v. Jordan[1] , the accused was charged with having flock in his possession \"for the purpose of making\" certain articles. He had received from his sister a mattress, the seams of which he had opened, and \"removed the flock with the intention of putting it back in the same covering.\" It was held that the accused was neither making nor manufacturing a mattress. In the language of Avory J., at p. 153:\nIn one sense a new mattress may be made out of a secondhand one; new covering may be put upon old stuffing, or an old cover may be stuffed with new flock. Those are not the operations in question.\nThe accused, in the case at bar, was fashioning or changing a piece of white paper into a paper to be used for an entirely new and different purpose and without the additions he made it could not be so used. The white paper had to be changed or fashioned; in a word, it had to be made to serve that new purpose.\nCounsel for the accused referred to ss. 14, 15, 16 and 20 of the Forgery Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 165. No doubt these were present to the mind of Parliament when it enacted s. 471(a) (or rather its predecessor s. 434(a) in the Criminal Code of 1892 R.S.C., c. 29), which is entirely different in its language and much wider in its scope. The foregoing sections were drafted in more detail and in that sense are limited in their application and no doubt more favourable to the contention of counsel for the accused. It is not, however, from a construction of the language of those sections but rather that of s. 471(a) that the submission of counsel on behalf of the accused must be determined. The language of that section sets forth a clear intention on the part of Parliament to make that which the accused here did an offence.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice O'Halloran in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H. T. Fitzsimmons.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Eric Pepler.\n[1] [1913] 3 K.B. 149.\n"

Both father and son were sued. The action was maintained against the son, who did not appeal, but dismissed against the father. In the Court of Appeal, plaintiff succeeded in having the father condemned jointly and severally with the son.\nHeld: The action against the father should be dismissed since he rebutted the presumption of Art. 1054 of the Civil Code by proving that his son was an experienced driver, that he had given him a good education and had properly supervised him, thus establishing that in lending him the truck he acted prudently and committed no fault. The presumption of s. 53 of the Motor Vehicles Act was also destroyed by the evidence as to the competency of the son as a driver.\nHeld further, that following the principle enunciated in City of Montreal v. Watt and Scott, the father did not have to establish that it was physically impossible for him to prevent the damage (i.e., force majeure), but that he was unable to prevent it by reasonable means (i.e., that there was absence of fault on his part).\nPer Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand and Fauteux JJ.: This action could not be based on the fact that the damage was caused by a thing under the father's care since the cause of the accident was the intervention of some human agency; nor could it be based on any master and servant relationship since the son was not acting in his father's interest.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, reversing the trial judge and holding that the father appellant was jointly and severally liable with his son for the damage caused by the son while driving his father's truck with his permission during a pleasure ride.\nW.

Le fils \u00e9tait tout pr\u00e8s de sa majorit\u00e9; il avait au-del\u00e0 de vingt ans et demi. Il \u00e9tait devenu majeur au moment o\u00f9 la cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 instruite. Il poss\u00e9dait un permis comme chauffeur, apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 des examens.\nL'enqu\u00eate au proc\u00e8s d\u00e9montra qu'il pleuvait abondamment ce soir-l\u00e0, ce qui causait une certaine brume ou bu\u00e9e. Le camion se dirigeait dans le m\u00eame sens que la voiture o\u00f9 se trouvait mademoiselle Hardy et les lumi\u00e8res rouges, \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re de cette voiture, fonctionnaient au moment de la collision. Cette voiture \u00e9tait stationnaire.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance fut d'avis qu'il n'y avait aucune explication du fait que le chauffeur du camion avait frapp\u00e9 cette auto comme il le fit, car, dit-il, elle \"devait \u00eatre bien visible dans le rayon de ses phares\".

Le jugement ajoute que \"le d\u00e9fendeur Dorillas \u00e9tait pr\u00e8s de sa majorit\u00e9, d'assez longue exp\u00e9rience, \u00e9tait un chauffeur comp\u00e9tent, avait son permis de conduire apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 les examens sp\u00e9ciaux requis par la loi\" et que, dans ces circonstances, \"Honor\u00e9 Alain n'\u00e9tait aucunement responsable de l'accident\".\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi (en appel) 2 infirma ce jugement. Interpr\u00e9tant la preuve comme ayant \u00e9tabli que l'habitude entre le p\u00e8re et le fils \u00e9tait de laisser ce dernier \"prendre le soir le camion pour son usage et son plaisir personnels en toute libert\u00e9, sans demande sp\u00e9ciale, et sans avertir de l'usage qu'il en voulait faire\", elle fut d'avis qu'il y avait erreur dans le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l'effet que le camion avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00eat\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 son fils et que la garde en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 celui-ci. Elle appliqua donc au p\u00e8re, le pr\u00e9sent appelant, l'article 1054 du Code Civil et le condamna \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 la somme de $7,287.87 \"conjointement et solidairement avec son co-d\u00e9fendeur d\u00e9j\u00e0 condamn\u00e9\".\nQuatre des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi ont seuls \u00e9crit des notes \u00e0 l'appui du jugement de cette Cour, et, en somme, le tribunal d'appel s'est ralli\u00e9 aux raisons expos\u00e9es par l'honorable juge Marchand. C'est lui qui a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 le jugement formel et c'est dans les notes qu'il a fournies que l'on doit trouver les motifs de la Cour d'Appel pour infirmer le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. L'honorable juge Marchand d\u00e9clare que la carence par le fils d'\u00e9carter la prescription de l'article 53 de la Loi des v\u00e9hicules moteurs constitue sur ce point \"chose jug\u00e9e pour l'un et l'autre\"; ce qui doit s'interpr\u00e9ter, \u00e9videmment, comme signifiant que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 contre le fils doit \u00eatre tenu pour chose jug\u00e9e contre le p\u00e8re. Il y a lieu de s'en \u00e9tonner puisque le p\u00e8re, en premier lieu, a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d'un jugement de premi\u00e8re instance qui a d\u00e9bout\u00e9 l'action \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, et, en second lieu, puisque l'intim\u00e9 Hardy lui-m\u00eame en a appel\u00e9 de ce jugement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du p\u00e8re. Il ne saurait y avoir chose jug\u00e9e dans une affaire qui est port\u00e9e en appel.\nPour la responsabilit\u00e9 du p\u00e8re, l'honorable juge Marchand examine la port\u00e9e de l'article 1054 du Code Civil et celle de l'article 53 de la Loi des v\u00e9hicules moteurs. Au sujet du premier article, il fait remarquer que les parents \"ne peuvent \u00e9chapper \u00e0 cette responsabilit\u00e9 qu'en prouvant leur impossibilit\u00e9 d'emp\u00eacher la commission\" des fautes des enfants. Sur ce point, il mentionne que Dorillas, lors de l'accident, \u00e9tait mineur, bien qu'approchant sa vingt-et-uni\u00e8me ann\u00e9e. \"Il travaillait avec son p\u00e8re \u00e0 livrer de porte en porte de la glace pour usage domestique. Depuis l'\u00e2ge de quatorze ans, alors qu'il avait quitt\u00e9 l'\u00e9cole, il s'\u00e9tait habitu\u00e9 \u00e0 la man\u0153uvre du camion qui servait \u00e0 ce travail. Il avait, l'ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, obtenu un permis de conducteur. Il ne semble pas avoir caus\u00e9 \u00e0 ses parents d'inqui\u00e9tudes particuli\u00e8res. Il n'\u00e9tait pas adonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'usage des liqueurs enivrantes. Dans son travail, en ville, il para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 assidu et prudent\u2026 il avait l'habitude de se servir du camion pour son usage et son plaisir personnels, une fois sa journ\u00e9e de travail faite\u2026 il le prenait, en se contentant de dire \u00e0 son p\u00e8re qu'il partait dans la voiture. Il ne se souciait pas de lui en demander la permission; il avait sa propre clef d'allumage; il ne s'astreignait pas, il n'\u00e9tait pas astreint \u00e0 dire o\u00f9 il allait, sur quelles routes, avec qui, le temps qu'il passerait. C'est dans une ind\u00e9pendance compl\u00e8te, sans contr\u00f4le aucun, qu'il se servait ainsi de la voiture pour son plaisir\".\nL'honorable juge Marchand en conclut qu'ayant donn\u00e9 \u00e0 son fils la libert\u00e9 de se servir du camion \u00e0 sa guise, pour son plaisir, le p\u00e8re s'est trouv\u00e9 dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 de rapporter une preuve satisfaisante qu'il n'avait pu emp\u00eacher l'accident et qu'il \"doit \u00eatre tenu solidairement responsable des dommages caus\u00e9s par le quasi-d\u00e9lit de son fils\". C'est l\u00e0 la raison de base du jugement de la Cour d'Appel.\nL'enqu\u00eate a \u00e9tabli, sans contradiction, que le soir de l'accident le fils avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 son p\u00e8re l'autorisation de se servir du camion (Case p. 107, ligne 32).\nEn pareil cas, le pr\u00eateur ne peut \u00eatre tenu responsable de la faute de l'emprunteur que s'il a omis de prendre les pr\u00e9cautions n\u00e9cessaires pour se renseigner sur l'habilet\u00e9 de l'emprunteur et ses connaissances comme chauffeur d'automobile. (O'Connor v. Wray 3). Or, ici, il ne peut y avoir le moindre doute sur les capacit\u00e9s du fils comme chauffeur. Il conduisait le m\u00eame camion depuis trois ans, dans les rues de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, pour y faire la livraison de la glace pour le compte de son p\u00e8re. Il est \u00e9vident qu'il avait donc une grande exp\u00e9rience, plus que suffisante, pour que son p\u00e8re ne commit aucune imprudence en lui pr\u00eatant le camion. A cela, il suffit d'ajouter le t\u00e9moignage rendu au fils dans le jugement m\u00eame de la Cour d'Appel, tel qu'exprim\u00e9 dans les notes de l'honorable juge Marchand. En plus, le dossier permet \u00e9galement de d\u00e9cider que, ainsi que d'ailleurs le p\u00e8re l'avait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans sa plaidoirie \u00e9crite, il avait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 son fils une \"excellente \u00e9ducation et une bonne instruction\"\u2014ce qui est implicitement confirm\u00e9 dans ce que dit lui-m\u00eame l'honorable juge Marchand: \"Il n'\u00e9tait pas adonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'usage des liqueurs enivrantes. Dans son travail, en ville, il para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 assidu et prudent\". Et, un peu avant: \"Depuis l'\u00e2ge de quatorze ans, alors qu'il avait quitt\u00e9 l'\u00e9cole, il (le fils) s'\u00e9tait habitu\u00e9 \u00e0 la man\u0153uvre du camion qui servait \u00e0 ce travail\".\nEn tenant compte de cette situation, il me para\u00eet impossible de d\u00e9cider que le p\u00e8re avait \u00e9t\u00e9 imprudent en permettant \u00e0 son fils de se servir du camion.\nD'autre part, pour disposer de l'application de l'article 53 de la Loi des v\u00e9hicules moteurs, il me para\u00eet suffisant de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans la cause de O'Connor v. Wray, ci-haut cit\u00e9e. Et maintenant, pour en arriver \u00e0 l'application de l'article 1054 du Code Civil, dont la Cour du Banc du Roi s'est inspir\u00e9e pour maintenir contre le p\u00e8re l'appel du pr\u00e9sent intim\u00e9, je crois devoir me contenter de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 Mazeaud, Trait\u00e9 th\u00e9orique et pratique de la Responsabilit\u00e9 civile, 4e \u00e9d., Tome I, p. 719 au n\u00b0 777:\n777. Une question qui se pose souvent devant les tribunaux est celle de savoir si l'autorisation donn\u00e9e par les parents \u00e0 l'enfant d'accomplir un acte d\u00e9termin\u00e9 peut \u00eatre retenue comme constituant un d\u00e9faut de surveillance, et, par suite, emp\u00eacher les parents de se soustraire \u00e0 l'article 1384.\nIl va de soi que, si les parents ont autoris\u00e9 un acte r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible, leur responsabilit\u00e9 est engag\u00e9e: c'est le cas des parents qui laissent leur enfant conduire une automobile ou une motocyclette sans \u00eatre muni du permis de conduire, chasser sans permis.\nIl est encore certain que, si l'acte autoris\u00e9 est un acte particuli\u00e8rement dangereux, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9s les circonstances et notamment l'\u00e2ge de l'enfant, l'autorisation est fautive: telle l'autorisation accord\u00e9e \u00e0 un enfant de 7 ans de jouer avec des allumettes-tisons.\nMais la question est plus d\u00e9licate lorsque l'acte permis \u00e0 l'enfant n'a pas un caract\u00e8re dangereux aussi marqu\u00e9: par exemple, autorisation de circuler en bicyclette, en motocyclette ou en automobile avec un permis de conduire, de chasser avec un permis de chasse, de se livrer \u00e0 un sport violent. Si l'on oblige les parents, pour s'exon\u00e9rer, \u00e0 prouver la force majeure, il faut, dans tous les cas, engager leur responsabilit\u00e9; ils avaient en effet un moyen d'\u00e9viter le dommage: refuser leur autorisation. Mais on doit se contenter de la preuve de l'absence de faute. Le probl\u00e8me consiste donc \u00e0 se demander si les parents ont commis une imprudence, un d\u00e9faut de surveillance, en donnant l'autorisation. On voit alors qu'il n'y a pas de r\u00e9ponse absolue. Tout d\u00e9pendra des circonstances de fait dans chaque affaire; on tiendra compte notamment du caract\u00e8re de l'enfant, de son \u00e2ge. Il n'est pas douteux que l'\u00e9volution du milieu social joue ici un grand r\u00f4le: il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, les tribunaux consid\u00e9raient que permettre \u00e0 un enfant de monter en bicyclette \u00e9tait toujours une imprudence; aujourd'hui, cette opinion para\u00eet excessive et nous approuvons pleinement la d\u00e9cision rendue le 13 octobre 1926 par le Tribunal f\u00e9d\u00e9ral suisse qui, apr\u00e8s avoir rappel\u00e9 qu'on doit tenir compte \"des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de la cause \u2026 se fonder, avant tout, sur les usages, sur les n\u00e9cessit\u00e9s de la vie, de m\u00eame que sur l'\u00e2ge et sur le caract\u00e8re de celui qui d\u00e9pend de l'autorit\u00e9 du chef de famille\", d\u00e9cide qu'on ne peut attendre d'un p\u00e8re, lorsque son fils a \"atteint un \u00e2ge qui, dans le milieu o\u00f9 il vit, \u00e9quivaut virtuellement \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de la majorit\u00e9 \u2026 qu'il exerce sur ce fils une surveillance telle qu'il doive l'emp\u00eacher d'essayer la motocyclette d'un ami\". En un mot, il faut rechercher s'il y a eu ou non absence de faute et pour cela comparer la conduite des parents \u00e0 celle d'une personne prudente.\nJe me rallie enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 cet expos\u00e9 de la doctrine, et, comme le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, je n'ai pu trouver chez l'appelant aucune faute ou aucune n\u00e9gligence de nature \u00e0 entra\u00eener sa responsabilit\u00e9. Il me para\u00eet \u00e9vident que le fils rencontrait toutes les conditions raisonnablement exigibles pour que le p\u00e8re fut justifi\u00e9 de lui permettre de se servir du camion, et que sa conduite \u00e9tait parfaitement celle \"d'une personne prudente\", pour employer l'expression de Mazeaud.\nEn th\u00e9orie, ce fils \u00e9tait encore mineur, mais il \u00e9tait sur le point de devenir majeur. Quelques mois de plus et l'article 1054 C.C. n'eut pu \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 contre le p\u00e8re. C'est l\u00e0 un \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui, sans \u00eatre suffisant pour \u00e9carter la responsabilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale du p\u00e8re, telle qu'elle est \u00e9dict\u00e9e dans cet article 1054 C.C., doit tout de m\u00eame entrer en ligne de compte pour savoir si le p\u00e8re doit b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la clause d'exon\u00e9ration de cet article.\nIci, le p\u00e8re me para\u00eet avoir \u00e9tabli toutes les circonstances qui, suivant une jurisprudence g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement admise, le lib\u00e8re de l'application de l'article 1054 C.C\nJe maintiendrais donc l'appel, avec d\u00e9pens, tant dans cette Cour que dans la Cour du Banc du Roi (en appel), et je r\u00e9tablirais le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nKerwin J.:\u2014I agree with the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Taschereau.\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Le demandeur \u00c9mile Hardy a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 curateur \u00e0 sa fille majeure Blandine, interdite pour d\u00e9mence. En cette qualit\u00e9, il a institu\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures l\u00e9gales contre Honor\u00e9 Alain et contre son fils Dorillas, de qui il r\u00e9clame conjointement et solidairement la somme de $21,287.57.\nIl all\u00e8gue que le camion du d\u00e9fendeur Honor\u00e9 Alain, conduit par le fils Dorillas, alors mineur, est venu en collision avec une voiture-automobile dans laquelle se trouvait Blandine Hardy, et lui a caus\u00e9 des dommages dont les deux d\u00e9fendeurs doivent \u00eatre tenus responsables. M. le Juge Rom\u00e9o Langlais de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de Qu\u00e9bec a condamn\u00e9 le fils \u00e0 payer la somme de $7,287.87, mais il a rejet\u00e9 l'action contre le p\u00e8re Honor\u00e9 Alain. Il en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que l'accident \u00e9tait imputable \u00e0 la conduite n\u00e9gligente du fils, mais que le p\u00e8re qui lui avait pr\u00eat\u00e9 son camion n'avait commis aucune faute, et qu'il ne pouvait en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre recherch\u00e9 en dommages. Dorillas Alain n'a pas appel\u00e9 du jugement qui l'a condamn\u00e9, mais Emile Hardy es qualit\u00e9 a appel\u00e9 du jugement qui a rejet\u00e9 l'action contre le p\u00e8re Honor\u00e9 Alain, et la Cour du Banc du Roi 4 a maintenu cet appel. Les deux d\u00e9fendeurs ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 tenus conjointement et solidairement responsables. Seul Honor\u00e9 Alain se pourvoit maintenant devant cette Cour, et pr\u00e9tend que quant \u00e0 lui, l'action aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e en premier lieu, parce que son fils, conducteur de la voiture, n'a commis aucune faute, et subsidiairement, m\u00eame en admettant la responsabilit\u00e9 quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle de ce dernier, il a droit au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du paragraphe 6 de l'article 1054 C.C., vu qu'il \"n'a pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage\".\nL'appelant est marchand de glace et exerce son commerce dans les limites de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, et son fils co-d\u00e9fendeur est son employ\u00e9 r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9. Ce dernier est pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la distribution de la glace de porte en porte, et conduit le camion qui sert \u00e0 la transporter. Il est cependant clairement \u00e9tabli qu'au moment de l'accident, aucune relation de ma\u00eetre et de commettant n'existait entre le p\u00e8re et le fils, car c'est en dehors des heures de travail, et \u00e0 un moment o\u00f9 Dorillas n'\u00e9tait pas dans l'exercice de ses fonctions, que s'est produit l'accident qui a donn\u00e9 lieu au pr\u00e9sent litige.\nLe soir en question, soit le 14 juin 1947, Dorillas Alain, apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu de son p\u00e8re, la permission qui d'ailleurs ne lui \u00e9tait jamais refus\u00e9e, de se servir du camion, se rendit \u00e0 Cap Sant\u00e9 dans le comt\u00e9 de Portneuf, en compagnie d'une demoiselle Paquet. La visibilit\u00e9 sur la route n'\u00e9tait pas bonne, car le temps \u00e9tait pluvieux et il y avait de la brume. Apr\u00e8s quelques arr\u00eats \u00e0 Cap Sant\u00e9, o\u00f9 le fils Alain et mademoiselle Paquet prirent un verre de bi\u00e8re et un l\u00e9ger repas, ils reprirent la route num\u00e9ro 2 vers 10:45 heures p.m. pour revenir \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, et c'est en face de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'un nomm\u00e9 Pich\u00e9, que le camion de l'appelant frappa violemment la voiture d'un M. Dagenais, stationn\u00e9e sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la route, et dans laquelle se trouvait Blandine Hardy, qui a ainsi souffert de s\u00e9rieuses blessures lui causant une d\u00e9mence permanente. Je ne crois pas qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer si le jugement, condamnant le fils Alain et lui attribuant la responsabilit\u00e9 de cet accident, emp\u00eache l'appelant de dire que cet accident n'est pas d\u00fb \u00e0 la faute de son fils. Il importe peu de savoir si sur ce point, comme le pr\u00e9tend M. le Juge Marchand, avec qui ont concouru MM. les Juges Galipeault et Casey, il y a chose jug\u00e9e, car je suis d'opinion, comme l'a trouv\u00e9 M. le Juge Langlais, que le fils Alain est responsable de cet accident. En effet, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'il conduisait le camion imprudemment, \u00e0 une trop grande allure alors qu'il pleuvait et que le temps \u00e9tait brumeux. Sur ce point, l'appelant ne peut r\u00e9ussir.\nLe second motif soumis \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de cette Cour pr\u00e9sente plus d'int\u00e9r\u00eat, et aussi beaucoup plus de difficult\u00e9s. C'est la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant qu'il a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 repousser la pr\u00e9somption qui existe contre lui, vu qu'il est le p\u00e8re de cet enfant mineur, qui conduisait le camion. L'article 1054 C.C. dit ceci:\nToute personne \u2026 est responsable non seulement du dommage qu'elle cause par sa propre faute, mais encore de celui caus\u00e9 par la faute de ceux dont elle a le contr\u00f4le, et par les choses qu'elle a sous sa garde.\nLe p\u00e8re, et apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, la m\u00e8re, sont responsables du dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs enfants mineurs.\n* * *\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 ci-dessus a lieu seulement lorsque la personne qui y est assujettie ne peut prouver qu'elle n'a pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage.\nCet article \u00e9tablit \u00e9videmment une pr\u00e9somption que le p\u00e8re est responsable du d\u00e9lit ou du quasi-d\u00e9lit de son fils mineur, mais, cette pr\u00e9somption peut \u00eatre repouss\u00e9e si le p\u00e8re \u00e9tablit \"qu'il n'a pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage\". C'est-\u00e0-dire, que si la clause d'exon\u00e9ration trouve son application, le p\u00e8re ne pourra \u00eatre recherch\u00e9 en dommages pour le quasi-d\u00e9lit de son fils.\nLe jugement de la Cour d'Appel, comme quelques autres rendus dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, semblent faire reposer la responsabilit\u00e9 du p\u00e8re sur le fait que tout en laissant la possession physique de sa voiture \u00e0 son fils mineur, il en a tout de m\u00eame conserv\u00e9 la garde juridique. (Vide dans ce sens Beaulieu v. Roy 5; Arklay v. Andrews 6; Lambert v. Dumais 7; Mouette v. Laplante 8.\nCe principe d\u00e9coule n\u00e9cessairement de l'application du premier paragraphe de l'article 1054, qui est \u00e0 l'effet que toute personne est responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 par les choses qu'elle a sous sa garde. Or, dit-on, si le p\u00e8re a conserv\u00e9 la garde juridique du camion, il est responsable de l'accident caus\u00e9 par son fils mineur Dorillas. Avec respect, je ne puis souscrire \u00e0 cette proposition l\u00e9gale. Ce premier paragraphe de l'article 1054 a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintes fois interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 par nos tribunaux, et la jurisprudence reconnue est aujourd'hui \u00e0 l'effet que pour que cette derni\u00e8re partie du premier paragraphe de 1054 C.C. s'applique, il faut n\u00e9cessairement que le dommage ait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par le fait de la chose elle-m\u00eame sans aucune intervention humaine. (Quebec Railway v. Vandry 9). Cette cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment comment\u00e9e par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Watt v. Scott et la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al 10. Dans Curley v. Latreille 11, M. le Juge Anglin disait d\u00e9j\u00e0:\nResponsibility for damage caused by a thing which he has under his care (art. 1054 C.C. para. 1) arises only when the occurrence is due to the thing itself, not when it is ascribable to the conduct of the person by whom it is put in motion, controlled or directed.\nDans Lacombe v. Power 12, le Juge en chef Anglin rendant le jugement unanime de la Cour, s'exprimait dans les termes suivants:\nThe automobile on which the deceased was working was safe and harmless while in the position in which he had placed it on the third floor of the defendants' garage. It became dangerous only because it either started of itself or was put in motion. If the proper inference from the evidence was that the automobile started of itself, i.e., without the intervention of human agency, and owing to something inherent in the machine, the ensuing damage might be ascribable to it as a \"thing\" and be within the purview of art. 1054 C.C. But if its movement was due to an act of the deceased; conscious or unconscious, the damage was caused, not by the thing itself, but by that act, whether it should be regarded as purely involuntary and accidental or as amounting to negligence or fault. On the latter hypotheses, the provision of art. 1054 C.C, invoked by the appellant, does not apply: either the case was one of pure accident, entailing no liability; or, if there be liability, it must rest on fault to be proven and not presumed.\nEt, dans P\u00e9russe v. Stafford 13, l'honorable Juge Anglin disait encore:\nIn the second place, it is contended that fault is presumed against the defendant under article 1054 of the Civil Code, because the injury was caused by a thing under her care. Our view is that that provision has no application to a case where, as here, the real cause of the accident is the intervention of some human agency\u2014the question whether such human agency\u2014that of the driver in this case\u2014is at fault being a question of fact. Damage is not caused by a thing which is in the control of the defendant within the meaning of art. 1054 C.C. where it is really due to some fault in the operation or handling of the thing by the person in control of it.\nCommentant la cause de Vandry v. Quebec Railway, la Cour d'Appel de Qu\u00e9bec dans La Compagnie des Tramways de Montr\u00e9al v. Lapointe 14, a jug\u00e9:\nPour qu'il y ait application de l'article 1054 Code Civil, et de la pr\u00e9somption de faute qui r\u00e9sulte de la garde d'une chose inanim\u00e9e, il faut que l'accident soit d\u00fb \u00e0 un vice de la chose ou que le dommage ait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par elle-m\u00eame seule sans aucune intervention ext\u00e9rieure.\nVoir \u00e9galement News Pulp v. McMillan 15.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, il est certain que ce n'est pas la chose elle-m\u00eame, le camion, qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage. C'est comme cons\u00e9quence de la conduite n\u00e9gligente de la voiture par le fils que les dommages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s. Il y a eu intervention humaine. En cons\u00e9quence, il me semble impossible de tenir le p\u00e8re responsable sous pr\u00e9texte qu'il aurait eu la garde juridique du camion. D'ailleurs, m\u00eame s'il l'avait eue, il aurait encore pu se lib\u00e9rer, car celui qui a ainsi la garde juridique d'une chose peut invoquer le paragraphe 6 de 1054, en prouvant qu'il n'a pas pu par des moyens raisonnables emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage. (Vandry v. Quebec Railway) supra. Dans Watt v. Scott et la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al 16, apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 le principe que le paragraphe 6 de 1054 s'applique \u00e0 tous les paragraphes de cet article, sauf au dernier relatif aux ma\u00eetres et serviteurs, Lord Dunedin s'exprimait ainsi: The only addition to the views expressed in Vandry's case, which was not necessary there but is necessary here, is that in their Lordships' view, \"unable to prevent the damage complained of\" means unable by reasonable means.\nOn a aussi pr\u00e9tendu, et cette th\u00e9orie ing\u00e9nieuse a rencontr\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 quelque faveur dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, que le fils en conduisant l'auto de son p\u00e8re devient son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, au cas d'accident, ce dernier est responsable des dommages subis. Il est \u00e9videmment facile d'imaginer des cas o\u00f9 la femme serait la pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e de son mari, ou le fils le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de son p\u00e8re, mais quand le p\u00e8re pr\u00eate son automobile \u00e0 son fils, pour des fins personnelles au fils, qui ne se rapportent nullement aux affaires du p\u00e8re, le rapport de ma\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 n'existe pas, et la responsabilit\u00e9 du p\u00e8re n'est pas engag\u00e9e en vertu du dernier paragraphe de l'article 1054. La relation de ma\u00eetre et de serviteur suppose de toute n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 que ce dernier agisse dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du premier. (Savatier, \"Responsabilit\u00e9 Civile\", Vol. I, pages 382 et 383). Or, rien de tel n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente cause.\nLe v\u00e9ritable principe qu'il faut donc appliquer en l'esp\u00e8ce, c'est que le p\u00e8re, appelant, est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 responsable des actes de son fils mineur. Cette pr\u00e9somption cependant peut \u00eatre d\u00e9truite en prouvant que le p\u00e8re n'a pas pu emp\u00eacher le dommage tel que le veut la clause d'exon\u00e9ration de l'article 1054. Quelle est donc la preuve que doit faire le p\u00e8re pour d\u00e9montrer qu'il n'a pu ainsi emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage? Plusieurs jugements l'ont clairement \u00e9tablie. Ainsi, dans Charron v. Leclerc 17, le p\u00e8re d'un enfant mineur a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu responsable, parce qu'il n'avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu'il n'avait pas commis de faute, mais les notes des honorables Juges de la Cour d'Appel sont \u00e0 l'effet que si le p\u00e8re avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus prudent en laissant la conduite de son automobile \u00e0 son fils, l'action contre lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Dans Laflamme v. R\u00e9millard18, la Cour d'Appel de Qu\u00e9bec a jug\u00e9 que le p\u00e8re \u00e9tait responsable parce qu'il tol\u00e9rait que son fils se serve de son automobile, sans qu'il eut d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que celui-ci avait pour cela la comp\u00e9tence voulue. D'autres autorit\u00e9s \u00e9galement permettent de conclure que la n\u00e9gligence d'un p\u00e8re consisterait donc \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 son fils incomp\u00e9tent de conduire une automobile, de ne pas exercer la surveillance voulue, et d'avoir failli \u00e0 lui donner une bonne \u00e9ducation. (Colin et Capitant, \"Droit Civil\", Vol. 2, 10\u00e8me \u00e9d. p. 252; Savatier, \"Responsabilit\u00e9 Civile\", Vol. 1, p. 326).\nLe procureur de l'intim\u00e9 a soumis que le p\u00e8re aurait pu emp\u00eacher le dommage s'il avait refus\u00e9 de pr\u00eater l'automobile \u00e0 son fils. Il est certain que dans cette \u00e9ventualit\u00e9, il n'y aurait pas eu d'accident, mais l\u00e0 n'est pas le crit\u00e8re de la responsabilit\u00e9. Le p\u00e8re n'est pas tenu de d\u00e9montrer qu'il y avait impossibilit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te d'emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage. En effet, si le texte devait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de cette fa\u00e7on, et s'il fallait lui donner une telle rigidit\u00e9, seule la preuve du cas fortuit, de la force majeure ou de l'acte d'un tiers, pourraient faire disapara\u00eetre la responsabilit\u00e9. Il doit y avoir plus de flexibilit\u00e9, et ce qu'il faut rechercher, c'est toujours la faute, et s'il y a eu surveillance, bonne \u00e9ducation, pr\u00eat d'une auto \u00e0 un chauffeur comp\u00e9tent, on peut dire que le p\u00e8re a agi comme un homme prudent, et il est alors exempt de responsabilit\u00e9. Je n'ignore pas qu'on a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le fait pour un p\u00e8re de pr\u00eater une bicyclette \u00e0 son enfant mineur, ou de lui permettre de jouer \u00e0 un sport violent, constituait faute de sa part, mais cette vue \u00e9troite de la responsabilit\u00e9 paternelle est maintenant surann\u00e9e. Comme le dit Savatier (\"Responsabilit\u00e9 Civile\", Vol. 1, p. 327):\nNous croyons tendencieuses ou p\u00e9rim\u00e9es, les d\u00e9cisions qui affirment que le p\u00e8re a manqu\u00e9 de prudence par cela seul qu'il a laiss\u00e9 son fils monter \u00e0 bicyclette, ou m\u00eame jouer au football, et nous pensons le p\u00e8re d\u00e9charg\u00e9 de toute responsabilit\u00e9, si le sport que pratiquait l'enfant \u00e9tait normal pour son \u00e2ge, et si les conditions dans lesquelles il s'exerce excluait toute surveillance imm\u00e9diate du p\u00e8re, et par cons\u00e9quent, toute possibilit\u00e9 pour lui d'emp\u00eacher le dommage.\nMazeaud (Responsabilit\u00e9 Civile, Vol. 1, pages 719 et 720) dit ce qui suit, apr\u00e8s avoir expliqu\u00e9 que la responsabilit\u00e9 du p\u00e8re dispara\u00eet, s'il peut d\u00e9montrer qu'il a bien surveill\u00e9 son enfant, qu'il lui a donn\u00e9 une bonne \u00e9ducation:\nMais la question est plus d\u00e9licate lorsque l'acte permis \u00e0 l'enfant n'a pas un caract\u00e8re dangereux aussi marqu\u00e9: par exemple, autorisation de circuler en bicyclette, en motocyclette ou en automobile avec un permis de conduire, de chasser avec un permis de chasse, de se livrer \u00e0 un sport violent. Si on oblige les parents, pour s'exon\u00e9rer \u00e0 prouver la force majeure, il faut, dans tous les cas, engager leur responsabilit\u00e9; ils avaient en effet un moyen d'\u00e9viter le dommage: refuser leur autorisation. Mais on doit se contenter de la preuve de l'absence de faute. Le probl\u00e8me consiste donc \u00e0 se demander si les parents ont commis une imprudence, un d\u00e9faut de surveillance, en donnant l'autorisation \u2026 En un mot, il faut rechercher s'il y a eu ou non absence de faute et pour cela comparer la conduite des parents \u00e0 celle d'une personne prudente.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, je suis d'opinion, comme l'a dit M. le Juge Langlais de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, que le pr\u00e9sent appelant a clairement d\u00e9montr\u00e9 la comp\u00e9tence de son fils pour conduire une automobile. Le fils \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de vingt ans, \u00e9tait porteur d'une licence provinciale qu'il a obtenue apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 les examens requis. Il conduisait le camion depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es comme employ\u00e9 de son p\u00e8re, et en plus s'en servait en dehors de ses heures d'ouvrage, pour son usage personnel. Il \u00e9tait un chauffeur comp\u00e9tent d'assez longue exp\u00e9rience, n'\u00e9tait pas adonn\u00e9 aux liqueurs alcooliques, et comme le dit M. le Juge Marchand dans ses notes \"Dans son travail en ville, il para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 assidu et prudent\", je ne vois rien qui puisse \u00eatre reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant, et qui puisse entra\u00eener sa responsabilit\u00e9 civile. Il a repouss\u00e9 la pr\u00e9somption \u00e9tablie par l'article 1054 C.C.\nL'article 53 de la Loi des V\u00e9hicules Moteurs (S.R.Q. 1941, c. 142) n'aide pas davantage l'intim\u00e9. La pr\u00e9somption de responsabilit\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e contre le propri\u00e9taire, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truite par la preuve de comp\u00e9tence du chauffeur, et par cons\u00e9quent, il y a absence de faute de l'appelant.\nDans ces conditions, l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu, et l'action contre Honor\u00e9 Alain, rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours.\nRand J.:\u2014I concur in the reasons and conclusions of the Chief Justice and of Mr. Justice Taschereau.\nFauteux J.:\u2014Je concours dans les raisons et conclusions de M. le Juge en chef et de M. le juge Taschereau.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the Appellant: W.

The grounds of annulment alleged were (1) that she had been the victim of lesion and fraud; (2) that the condition for which she was later interdicted existed notoriously at the time of the contract; and that (3), in any event, she was too mentally feeble at the time to give a valid consent to the contract. The action was allowed by the trial judge but dismissed by the Court of Appeal chiefly on the ground that her mental condition was not notorious at the time.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed as there had been nothing done to put the parties back in the position they occupied before the loan, and the money advanced in good faith had not been repaid.\nPer Rinfret C.J.: There was ample proof of her mental incapacity and even if notoriety were not proven, she was unable to contract as under Arts. 984 and 986 C.C. a person who, by reason of mental weakness, is unable to give a valid consent, is incapable of contracting. The contract should therefore be subject to annulment; however, since the monies loaned were not tendered back to the lenders and since feeble-minded persons are not mentioned in Art. 1011 C.C., the exception contained in that Article is of no avail to her, therefore the action should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau J.: Under Art. 335 C.C. mere mental incapacity or imbecility is not enough, it must also be shown that it was notorious, that is, generally known, not only to experts and a few friends but also to the people in the neighbourhood or locality. There was no proof of such notoriety in this case. But assuming that the act was signed when the borrower was in a state of mental incapacity,\u2014the nullity being only relative\u2014the parties must be replaced in the position they occupied prior to the contract, i.e., the monies loaned must be returned; otherwise the act remains valid. The exception in Art. 1011 C.C. only applies to acts made by interdicts, minors or married women during their interdiction, minority or marriage, and since the borrower was not in either of these three categories at the time and since no such payment or tender was made, the action should be dismissed.\nPer Rand J.: Taking the facts to be that the borrower at the time the act was passed was incapable of appreciating its import, but that her condition was not notorious, the rule is that the act was null. But the nullity is relative and the right to set aside the contract on the ground of mental incapacity is subject to the condition that what was received must be returned. As that was not offered here, the action fails.\nPer Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: There was no proof of lesion and, in any event, only minors can plead it. Nor was there any proof that if there were fraud, the lenders were parties to it or knew of it, and furthermore, to succeed on this point, the borrowers had to tender the monies back (Latreille v. Gouin [1926] S.C.R. 558). As to the notoriety, there was no proof of it, but assuming the notoriety, it is doubtful whether the trial judge exercised judicially his discretionary power to annul in view of the lenders' good faith. As to whether the borrower was insane or mentally incapable of giving a valid consent, it was not established that she was insane, but whether insane or merely feeble-minded, she cannot have the act annulled since she did not offer to return the monies. The exception contained in Art. 1011 C.C. is of no help to her as it applies only to minors, married women or interdicts.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, dismissing an action by the curator to an interdicted woman seeking the annulment of a mortgage loan secured by the incapable three years before her interdiction.\nGustave Mouette, K.C., and Ren\u00e9 Duranleau, K.C., for the appellants.\nC. H. Desjardins, K.C., for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice: Paul Lussier, l'un des appelants, a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 curateur aux biens et \u00e0 la personne de sa tante, Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi, le treize avril 1945, dans un jugement pronon\u00e7ant l'interdiction de cette derni\u00e8re pour cause d'imb\u00e9cilit\u00e9. Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi \u00e9tait alors c\u00e9libataire et \u00e2g\u00e9e de soixante-seize ans. Elle est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, le trois mai 1949, \u00e2g\u00e9e de plus de soixante-dix-neuf ans.\nEn sa qualit\u00e9 de curateur de Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi, Paul Lussier institua contre les d\u00e9fenderesses-intim\u00e9es une action aux fins d'obtenir une d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9 et l'annulation d'un acte d'obligation pass\u00e9 le vingt-quatre juillet 1942, devant le notaire \u00c9mile Beauchemin.\nAux termes de cet acte d'obligation, Mlle Rosconi reconna\u00eet et d\u00e9clare devoir aux d\u00e9fenderesses-intim\u00e9es la somme de quatre mille dollars pour pr\u00eat d'autant remboursable dans quatre ans, et, en garantie de ce remboursement, elle leur c\u00e8de et transporte jusqu'\u00e0 due concurrence partie d'une cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire au montant de $29,000 qu'elle d\u00e9tient contre le mis-en-cause Phoenix.\nCette somme de quatre mille dollars avait \u00e9t\u00e9 remise \u00e0 Mlle Rosconi au moyen d'un ch\u00e8que sign\u00e9 par les intim\u00e9es et, apparemment, le 24 juillet 1942, date m\u00eame de l'acte d'obligation, elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ce ch\u00e8que \u00e0 son compte de banque; mais, d\u00e8s le m\u00eame jour, elle retira de son compte, par ch\u00e8que \u00e0 son ordre, la somme de $3,160. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l'emprunt avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par elle pour que la somme en fut remise \u00e0 un nomm\u00e9 P\u00e9ladeau. En fait, dans la comptabilit\u00e9 de Mlle Rosconi pour ce M. P\u00e9ladeau figure cette somme de $4,000.\nL'appelant es-qualit\u00e9 a attaqu\u00e9 cet acte d'obligation comme ill\u00e9gal et inexistant \u00e0 raison de l'\u00e9tat mental et de la faiblesse d'esprit de Mlle Rosconi qui, suivant lui, la rendaient incapable de contracter et de donner un consentement valable, et aussi \u00e0 cause de son \u00e9tat d'imb\u00e9cilit\u00e9 constant, continu et notoire.\nLes intim\u00e9es ont plaid\u00e9 en substance que Mlle Rosconi, que, d'ailleurs, elles n'ont ni connue ni rencontr\u00e9e, avait la capacit\u00e9 voulue pour contracter lorsque l'acte fut pass\u00e9 et que, ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 son interdiction, elle ne souffrait ni de d\u00e9mence ni d'imb\u00e9cilit\u00e9.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure accueillit l'action de l'appelant es-qualit\u00e9 et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ill\u00e9gal, irr\u00e9gulier, inexistant et nul \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit, cet acte hypoth\u00e9ciare du 24 juillet 1942, et a enjoint la mis-en-cause Brassard d'en radier l'enregistrement. La Cour du Banc du Roi (juridiction d'appel) 2 a infirm\u00e9 ce jugement et a rejet\u00e9 l'action avec d\u00e9pens.\nUn m\u00e9decin l\u00e9giste de grande r\u00e9putation, le docteur \u00c9mile Legrand, neurologue \u00e9minemment qualifi\u00e9, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lorsqu'il l'a examin\u00e9e, \u00e0 deux reprises, Mlle Rosconi souffrait d'une d\u00e9bilit\u00e9 mentale prononc\u00e9e qui l'emp\u00eachait de comprendre la port\u00e9e de l'acte qui fait l'objet du litige. Il d\u00e9clara que cette personne pr\u00e9sentait une grande insuffisance c\u00e9r\u00e9brale, que son niveau intellectuel \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s bas et que ses facult\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient pas d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es. Il ajoute, qu'\u00e0 son avis, cette faiblesse mentale datait de sa naissance et \u00e9tait chez elle cong\u00e9nitale, qu'elle souffrait d'une d\u00e9ficience qui la rendait absolument incapable de donner un consentement valable.\nLe docteur Jean Saucier, expert reconnu dans les maladies nerveuses, corrobora enti\u00e8rement le docteur Legrand et exprima l'avis que Mlle Rosconi \u00e9tait une d\u00e9bile mentale.\nEn plus, le docteur Georges Larin, qui a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 les maladies nerveuses pendant trois ans chez Charcot, \u00e0 Paris, et qui est un ami de la famille Rosconi depuis cinquante ans, apr\u00e8s avoir dit qu'il rencontrait cette demoiselle tous les jours, durant trois mois, pendant la derni\u00e8re maladie de sa m\u00e8re, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que Mlle Rosconi \u00e9tait une faible d'esprit atteinte de cr\u00e9dulit\u00e9 exag\u00e9r\u00e9e, qu'elle ne pouvait pas discuter d'affaires s\u00e9rieuses et qu'elle ne jouissait pas d'une compr\u00e9hension normale. Il dit que, du vivant de sa m\u00e8re, Mlle Rosconi ne s'occupait nullement de l'administration de ses affaires. Elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 dilapider ses biens en donnant de l'argent \u00e0 tous ceux qui lui parlaient de la religion. Lorsqu'elle n'avait pas de fonds disponibles, ses qu\u00e9mandeurs n'avaient qu'\u00e0 s'adresser \u00e0 leur notaire, qui lui faisait consentir \u00e0 vil prix des cessions d'hypoth\u00e8ques et des ventes de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, bien en dessous de la valeur r\u00e9elle. Il en est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 qu'un grand nombre de personnes de mauvaise foi l'ont, par la suite, bassement exploit\u00e9e en faisant appel \u00e0 sa d\u00e9votion excessive et incomprise. Certaines gens peu scrupuleux ont eu recours \u00e0 toutes sortes d'escroqueries pour abuser de cette pauvre d\u00e9mente, et ses actes de prodigalit\u00e9 insens\u00e9e et d\u00e9raisonn\u00e9e se sont r\u00e9pandus chez certains exploiteurs. Le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 plusieurs incidents qui d\u00e9montreraient que Mlle Rosconi s'engageait dans toutes sortes de march\u00e9s, que le juge relate comme n'\u00e9tant pas d'une personne sens\u00e9e. Elle avait apparemment des lubies religieuses avec le r\u00e9sultat que \"quiconque savait l'aborder et lui parler de d\u00e9votion pouvait obtenir n'importe quel montant d'argent.\" Le demandeur lui-m\u00eame, qui, comme nous l'avons vu, est le neveu de Mlle Rosconi, affirme qu'il a connu sa tante depuis son enfance, qu'elle souffrait d'une d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle qui a toujours exist\u00e9, que l'on a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 lui extorquer des sommes tellement importantes que sur une fortune qui valait $150,000, il ne lui restait plus, lors de l'institution de l'action, que la somme de $58,000 environ. Sa s\u0153ur a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Mlle Rosconi n'a jamais rien compris des choses de la vie et que sa d\u00e9ficience mentale existait depuis sa naissance. Il faut ajouter \u00e0 cela que l'une de ses s\u0153urs fut intern\u00e9e \u00e0 Saint-Jean-de-Dieu (hospice des ali\u00e9n\u00e9s, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al) depuis cinquante-cinq ans et que trois autres parents sont d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s au m\u00eame endroit.\nDe l'avis de l'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance, aucun des notaires qui ont re\u00e7u d'elle des actes d'emprunt ou d'hypoth\u00e8que n'a pu affirm\u00e9 positivement que l'interdite \u00e9tait une personne normale et jouissant de toutes ses facult\u00e9s mentales. Aucun d'eux, d'ailleurs, ne l'aurait vue assez longtemps pour se rendre compte d'une fa\u00e7on convenable de son degr\u00e9 d'intelligence. Le notaire Beauchemin, qui a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 l'acte dont il est question, sur les instructions du nomm\u00e9 P\u00e9ladeau, l'a fait sans communiquer avec Mlle Rosconi ni lui fournir d'explications.\nDe toute la preuve, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure \"que le demandeur a \u00e9tabli hors de tout doute que Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi a \u00e9t\u00e9 une d\u00e9bile mentale depuis sa naissance. Sa faiblesse d'esprit \u00e9tait apparente, continue et notoire. Elle n'a jamais eu l'intelligence n\u00e9cessaire pour donner un consentement valable \u00e0 l'acte dont la validit\u00e9 m\u00eame est pr\u00e9sentement contest\u00e9e\".\nLe jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a donc consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que, de l'ensemble des t\u00e9moignages donn\u00e9s par des personnes dignes de foi et absolument responsables, il paraissait \u00e9vident que la faiblesse d'esprit de Mlle Rosconi \u00e9tait devenue un fait notoire, qu'elle souffrait d'ali\u00e9nation mentale et qu'elle n'a pu donner un consentement valable \u00e0 l'acte d'obligation attaqu\u00e9. En fait, le juge a trouv\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait acquis aux d\u00e9bats que Mlle Rosconi avait \u00e9t\u00e9 habituellement consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une d\u00e9mente et qu'elle n'a jamais eu d'intervalle lucide au cours de son existence.\nIl s'agissait d'appliquer ici les articles 335 et 986 du Code Civil.\nIl ne fait pas de doute, par application de l'article 334 C.C. que tout acte fait post\u00e9rieurement par l'interdit pour cause d'imb\u00e9cilit\u00e9 est nul, mais la question qui se posait dans la pr\u00e9sente cause \u00e9tait de d\u00e9cider quel pouvait \u00eatre l'effet des actes ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l'interdiction prononc\u00e9e pour imb\u00e9cilit\u00e9.\nL'article 335 d\u00e9clare que ces actes \"peuvent cependant \u00eatre annul\u00e9s, si la cause de l'interdiction existait notoirement \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 ces actes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits\".\nMais, d'autre part, l'article 986 d\u00e9clare \"incapables de contracter, entre autres, les personnes ali\u00e9n\u00e9es ou souffrant d'une aberration temporaire caus\u00e9e par maladie, accident, ivresse ou autre cause, ou qui, \u00e0 raison de la faiblesse de leur esprit, sont incapables de donner un consentement valable\".\nOr, en vertu de l'article 984 C.C., quatre choses sont n\u00e9cessaires pour la validit\u00e9 d'un contrat:\nDes parties ayant la capacit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale de contracter;\nLeur consentement donn\u00e9 l\u00e9galement;\nQuelque chose qui soit l'objet du contrat;\nUne cause ou consid\u00e9ration licite.\nIl s'ensuit que si, \u00e0 raison de sa faiblesse d'esprit, une personne est incapable de donner un consentement valable, par application de l'article 986, elle est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e incapable de contracter, en vertu de la loi, et elle ne peut plus rencontrer deux des conditions essentielles et n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 d'un contrat exig\u00e9es par l'article 984, \u00e0 savoir: la capacit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale de contracter et celle de donner l\u00e9galement son consentement. Ces deux derni\u00e8res conditions sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires pour la validit\u00e9 d'un contrat, en vertu de l'article 984, et si elles font d\u00e9faut le contrat est nul et inexistant. C'est ce dernier aspect de la cause qui, nous le disons en tout respect, para\u00eet avoir \u00e9chapp\u00e9 au jugement de la Cour d'Appel, qui s'appuie uniquement sur l'article 335 du Code Civil et qui ignore les articles 984 et 986 du Code.\nEn effet, si l'on parcourt le jugement formel, on s'aper\u00e7oit qu'il r\u00e9f\u00e8re au seul article 335 et que le raisonnement qui s'y trouve s'appuie uniquement sur les termes de cet article. Il d\u00e9cide que \"pour r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 faire rescinder le contrat a quo, pour le motif d'imb\u00e9cilit\u00e9 notoire, l'intim\u00e9 es-qualit\u00e9 (c'est-\u00e0-dire l'appelant devant la Cour Supr\u00eame), aux termes de l'article 335 C.C., devait r\u00e9pondre aux deux exigences qu'il contient, soit: la preuve de l'imb\u00e9cilit\u00e9 et la notori\u00e9t\u00e9 de son existence; et que si l'intim\u00e9 es-qualit\u00e9 (toujours le pr\u00e9sent appelant) a failli sur l'une ou l'autre de ces conditions, son action doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e et le jugement infirm\u00e9\". Il ajoute que \"la notori\u00e9t\u00e9 d'imb\u00e9cilit\u00e9 exig\u00e9e par l'article 335 du Code Civil n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e et que l'absence de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment vicie, dans son fondement, le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure\".\nSi l'on parcourt les notes des savants juges de la Cour d'Appel, l'on s'aper\u00e7oit qu'ils se pr\u00e9occupent uniquement de la question de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 qui est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e \"la condition essentielle au maintien de l'action\". Elles concluent \"que pour ce public d'o\u00f9 devait venir la notori\u00e9t\u00e9, il n'y avait rien qui dut la faire tenir pour incapable d'un emprunt\u2026 et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'une preuve suffisante \u00e0 cet effet, le demandeur perd le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de cette derni\u00e8re partie de l'article 335 C.C. susmentionn\u00e9 et qui \u00e9tait essentiel au succ\u00e8s de sa demande\".\nOn y lit encore ce qui suit:\n\"\u2026 le seul motif sur lequel le jugement pourrait s'appuyer serait l'\u00e9tat mental de Mlle Rosconi au mois de juillet 1942, et les cons\u00e9quences r\u00e9troactives de l'interdiction pour imb\u00e9cillit\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e en avril 1945, \u00e0 savoir: si les causes qui ont entra\u00een\u00e9 cette interdiction existaient notoirement \u00e0 la date du pr\u00eat\".\nEt encore:\n\"The burden of proof was upon the respondent (pr\u00e9sent appelant) to prove that the mental condition of Mlle Rosconi notoriously existed prior to the interdiction and at the time that the loan was made.\" Et aussi:\n\"I am not prepared to declare that such fact was notorious, in the sense of Article 335 C.C., on said last mentioned date, particularly when I find in the record indication of a sane appreciation of the purport of her acts by Miss Rosconi.\"\nL'on voit donc que la seule recherche des honorables juges de la Cour d'Appel s'est born\u00e9e \u00e0 trouver une preuve de notori\u00e9t\u00e9.\nMais, comme l'avait d'ailleurs signal\u00e9 le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, un obstacle beaucoup plus s\u00e9rieux \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 du contrat attaqu\u00e9 \u00e9tait \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans les articles 984 et 986 du Code Civil, dont il n'est nullement question dans les notes \u00e0 l'appui du jugement a quo.\nOr, non seulement les faits consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tablis par le juge du proc\u00e8s sont \u00e0 l'effet que Mlle Rosconi, \u00e0 raison de la faiblesse de son esprit depuis sa naissance, \u00e9tait incapable de donner un consentement valable et qu'il manquait donc \u00e0 son contrat, comme nous l'avons dit, deux des quatre \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaires pour la validit\u00e9 de ce contrat: son incapacit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale de contracter et l'impossibilit\u00e9 o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait de donner un consentement valable, mais la preuve, tout \u00e0 la fois des personnes qui l'ont connue et des m\u00e9decins qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus lors de l'enqu\u00eate, justifie suffisamment la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle en est arriv\u00e9 le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance sur ce point.\nDans les circonstances, il nous para\u00eet que, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, ce jugement \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9 et qu'il n'eut pas d\u00fb \u00eatre mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel).\nSans doute, lorsque, en plus du fait d'imb\u00e9cilit\u00e9 ou de faiblesse d'esprit pr\u00e9vue par les articles 984 et 986 du Code Civil, vient s'ajouter la notori\u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l'article 335 C.C., l'incapacit\u00e9 de la personne en cause offre une double raison d'annuler l'acte auquel elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 partie, mais il est \u00e9vident qu'en face des prescriptions des articles 984 et 986 l'on ne saurait dire que l'existence de la notori\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9e \u00e0 l'article 335 soit une condition essentielle au maintien d'une action pour annulation ou pour d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9 d'un contrat du genre de celle intent\u00e9e par l'appelant es-qualit\u00e9. L'absence de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 ne pouvait vicier, dans son fondement, le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, si, au surplus, ce jugement pouvait s'appuyer sur l'incapacit\u00e9 de Mlle Rosconi de donner un consentement valable, \u00e0 raison de la faiblesse de son esprit, car, dans ce cas, elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9e par la loi incapable de contracter et l'acte qu'elle a sign\u00e9 manquait de deux des \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels et n\u00e9cessaires pour la validit\u00e9 d'un contrat.\nIl reste, cependant, une question subsidiaire qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e devant cette Cour et que, d'ailleurs, avait signal\u00e9e l'honorable Juge en chef L\u00e9tourneau au cours de ses notes. C'est \u00e0 savoir que \"l'acte d'emprunt ne pourrait \u00eatre annul\u00e9 et mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 cette condition que l'emprunteuse offre et rembourse ce que lui a valu l'acte que l'on veut ainsi faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9; car il est en preuve que cette derni\u00e8re a bien eu et re\u00e7u ce montant de $4,000 pour lequel l'acte d'emprunt a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait et que c'est en toute bonne foi que ce montant lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni et avanc\u00e9 par les d\u00e9fenderesses (intim\u00e9es)\".\nSur ce point, il faut d'abord consid\u00e9rer la port\u00e9e des articles 987 et 1011 du Code Civil qui \u00e9dictent que \"l'incapacit\u00e9 des mineurs et des interdits pour prodigalit\u00e9 est \u00e9tablie en leur faveur. Ceux qui sont capables de contracter ne peuvent opposer l'incapacit\u00e9 des mineurs ou des interdits avec qui ils ont contract\u00e9\"; et l'article 1011, \u00e0 l'effet que \"lorsque les mineurs, les interdits ou les femmes mari\u00e9es, sont admis, en ces qualit\u00e9s, \u00e0 se faire restituer contre leurs contrats, le remboursement de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9, en cons\u00e9quence de ces engagements, pay\u00e9 pendant la minorit\u00e9, l'interdiction ou le mariage, n'en peut \u00eatre exig\u00e9, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit prouv\u00e9 que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi pay\u00e9 a tourn\u00e9 \u00e0 leur profit\".\nL'on ne saurait se d\u00e9fendre de trouver dans ces articles une certaine n\u00e9gligence de r\u00e9daction.\nL'article 987 ne parle que des mineurs et des interdits. En plus, il sp\u00e9cifie les \"interdits pour prodigalit\u00e9\".\nEn vertu de la proposition inclusio unius fit exclusio alterius, il s'ensuivrait que l'incapacit\u00e9 des autres personnes \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 l'article 986 n'est pas \u00e9tablie uniquement en leur faveur et que, comme cons\u00e9quence, les deux parties contractantes pourraient s'en pr\u00e9valoir. D'autre part, le deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de l'article 987 ne limite plus l'application aux interdits pour prodigalit\u00e9, mais il parle des interdits en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. L'on ne saurait penser que le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu corriger le premier paragraphe de l'article 987 par son second paragraphe. Il semblerait donc que l'emploi du mot \"interdit\" sans qualification, dans ce second paragraphe, ne r\u00e9f\u00e8re qu'aux interdits qui sont mentionn\u00e9s dans le premier paragraphe, c'est-\u00e0-dire, aux interdits pour prodigalit\u00e9 seulement.\nMais, d\u00e8s lors, sur quoi la doctrine s'appuie-t-elle pour d\u00e9clarer que, nonobstant cette \u00e9num\u00e9ration limit\u00e9e, l'article 987 contient un principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui s'applique \u00e0 tous les interdits?\nLes codificateurs ne s'en expliquent pas.\nL'article 1125 du Code Napol\u00e9on, qui correspond \u00e0 notre article 987 CC. est au m\u00eame effet, sauf qu'il mentionne le cas des femmes mari\u00e9es.\nJ'\u00e9prouve une certaine difficult\u00e9, lorsque le Code sp\u00e9cifie les interdits pour prodigalit\u00e9, d'arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que cet article couvre tous les interdits.\nD'autre part, l'on se trouve en pr\u00e9sence d'une difficult\u00e9 du m\u00eame genre si l'on passe \u00e0 l'article 1011. Il ne parle que des mineurs, des interdits ou des femmes mari\u00e9es; et l\u00e0, le mot \"interdits\" n'est pas qualifi\u00e9 comme il l'est dans l'article 987. Il omet les autres personnes qui apparaissent dans l'\u00e9num\u00e9ration de l'article 986 C.C. et, entre autres, le cas qui nous occupe o\u00f9, \u00e0 raison de sa faiblesse d'esprit, une personne incapable de donner un consentement valable est, par l'article 984, d\u00e9clar\u00e9e incapable de contracter.\nUne explication plausible de cette omission pourrait se trouver sans doute dans le fait que l'article 1124 du Code Napol\u00e9on, qui correspond \u00e0 l'article 986 du Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, ne contient pas les deux derni\u00e8res \u00e9num\u00e9rations de cet article 986. Le Code Civil fran\u00e7ais n'\u00e9num\u00e8re pas comme incapables de contracter, entre autres, les personnes qui, \u00e0 raison de la faiblesse de leur esprit, sont incapables de donner un consentement valable; et lorsque, dans l'article 1312 du Code fran\u00e7ais (qui correspond \u00e0 l'article 1011 du Code de Qu\u00e9bec), le l\u00e9gislateur en est venu \u00e0 traiter la question du remboursement de ce qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 en cons\u00e9quence d'engagements invalides, ce dernier n'a pas mentionn\u00e9 comme dispens\u00e9es du rembour- sement les personnes incapables de donner un consentement valable, parce que cette cat\u00e9gorie de personnes n'\u00e9tait pas, par le Code fran\u00e7ais, d\u00e9clar\u00e9e incapable de contracter.\nL'on peut \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendre que l'article 1011 \u00e9nonce un principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui doit s'\u00e9tendre non seulement aux mineurs, aux interdits ou aux femmes mari\u00e9es, mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 toutes les classes de personnes qui sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans l'article 986 du Code de Qu\u00e9bec.\nIl en r\u00e9ulterait que, pour que l'appelant eut pu \u00eatre contraint \u00e0 rembourser ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 \u00e0 Mlle Rosconi, il eut fallu que les intim\u00e9es prouvent que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi pay\u00e9 a tourn\u00e9 \u00e0 son profit.\nOn trouve d'ailleurs un principe de ce genre dans l'article 1146, en vertu duquel \"le paiement fait au cr\u00e9ancier n'est point valable s'il \u00e9tait incapable de le recevoir, \u00e0 moins que le d\u00e9biteur ne prouve que la chose pay\u00e9e a tourn\u00e9 au profit de ce cr\u00e9ancier\".\nEn l'esp\u00e8ce, aucune all\u00e9gation ne s'y rapporte dans la plaidoirie \u00e9crite et le point n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9.\nEn autant que l'on pourrait le d\u00e9duire du dossier, il semblerait m\u00eame que cette somme de $4,000 n'a pas tourn\u00e9 au profit de Mlle Rosconi, puisque toutes les circonstances paraissent \u00e9tablir qu'elle a fait cet emprunt, de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que dans plusieurs autres cas prouv\u00e9s lors de l'enqu\u00eate, uniquement dans le but de remettre cet argent imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 M. P\u00e9ladeau.\nNaturellement, Mlle Rosconi elle-m\u00eame n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue comme t\u00e9moin. Lors de l'enqu\u00eate, elle \u00e9tait interdite pour imb\u00e9cilit\u00e9. Et, malheureusement, Roger P\u00e9ladeau non plus n'a pu rendre t\u00e9moignage parce qu'au moment du proc\u00e8s il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de se rendre au tribunal pour cause de maladie.\nLes renseignements qu'offre le dossier sont donc n\u00e9cessairement incomplets. Cependant, ils r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que le notaire Beauchemin, qui a re\u00e7u l'acte, ne connaissait pas Mlle Rosconi avant le mois de juillet 1942 (N.B.\u2014Et c'est le 24 juillet que le contrat attaqu\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u par lui). Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, le notaire nous dit qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en relation avec Mlle Rosconi par M. P\u00e9ladeau lui-m\u00eame; que celui-ci lui aurait rendu visite \u00e0 son bureau dans le but d'obtenir un pr\u00eat d'argent; que c'est lui qui est venu cher- cher le notaire pour le conduire sur la rue Saint-Hubert, o\u00f9 demeurait Mlle Rosconi; qu'il lui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 cette derni\u00e8re et que c'est bien M. P\u00e9ladeau qui avait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au notaire que Mlle Rosconi avait besoin d'argent et qu'il lui avait demand\u00e9 si lui (le notaire) pouvait lui pr\u00eater le montant. Il d\u00e9clare: \"Je lui ai dit que M. P\u00e9ladeau avait demand\u00e9 de l'argent pour le transporter \u00e0 son neveu et elle a consenti\".\nLe notaire Beauchemin d\u00e9clare que M. P\u00e9ladeau lui \"disait qu'il venait de la part de Mlle Rosconi\". C'est P\u00e9ladeau qui a pay\u00e9 les frais de l'acte et la commission sur le pr\u00eat, sans que le notaire ait envoy\u00e9 un compte \u00e0 ce sujet. C'est P\u00e9ladeau qui payait les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur le pr\u00eat \u00e0 tous les six mois.\nIl semble probable que Mlle Rosconi n'a nullement profit\u00e9 de cet emprunt et que c'est ni plus ni moins Roger P\u00e9ladeau qui s'est servi d'elle comme interm\u00e9diaire pour se procurer ce montant de $4,000 dont il a retir\u00e9 le produit.\nEn autant qu'il est possible de d\u00e9chiffrer les entr\u00e9es faites par Mlle Rosconi sur les feuilles qui lui servaient de comptabilit\u00e9 pour Roger P\u00e9ladeau, ce serait bien ce dernier qui a re\u00e7u le montant de $4,000 qui a fait l'objet de l'acte attaqu\u00e9 par l'appelant.\nQue l'appelant es-qualit\u00e9, repr\u00e9sentant maintenant les droits de Mlle Rosconi, ne soit pas oblig\u00e9 de rembourser la somme de $4,000 que les intim\u00e9es ont apparemment vers\u00e9e de bonne foi et dans l'ignorance o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient de l'\u00e9tat mental de celle avec qui elles transigeaient, froisse \u00e9videmment les sentiments d'\u00e9quit\u00e9; mais s'il est exact que l\u2019imb\u00e9cilit\u00e9 de Mlle Rosconi la rendait incapable de faire un contrat comme celui dont il s'agit, il est certainement logique qu'elle ait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tat d'incapacit\u00e9 pour profiter de cette somme de $4,000, o\u00f9 elle n'a fait que servir d'instrument \u00e0 Roger P\u00e9ladeau; et on ne saurait dire que, dans les circonstances, les intim\u00e9es \u00e9taient sans rem\u00e8de, car il y a tout lieu de croire qu'elles auraient un recours contre P\u00e9ladeau lui-m\u00eame, dont la conduite pourrait peut-\u00eatre \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e par les tribunaux comme constituant une fraude \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard. C'est de P\u00e9ladeau dont elles auraient r\u00e9ellement \u00e9t\u00e9 les victimes, si les r\u00e9v\u00e9lations contenues au dossier doivent \u00eatre tenues pour exactes. Mlle Rosconi ne pourrait pas plus \u00eatre tenue responsable de ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 en rapport avec l'argent que les intim\u00e9es ont fourni qu'elle ne peut l'\u00eatre en rapport avec l'acte qu'on lui a fait consentir alors qu'elle \u00e9tait incapable de donner un consentement valable. Comme r\u00e9crit Laurent (Principes de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, tome 5i\u00e8me, 3i\u00e8me \u00e9d.): \"\u2026 La loi veut avant tout qu'il y ait ali\u00e9nation mentale, c'est-\u00e0-dire un \u00e9tat de maladie qui affecte l'intelligence et qui ne permet pas \u00e0 celui qui en est afflig\u00e9 de gouverner sa personne et ses biens\u2026 s'ils ne sont pas dirig\u00e9s dans la gestion de leurs affaires, ils sont victimes de leur incapacit\u00e9\" (N\u00b0 249, pp. 289, 290).\nDans les circonstances, il ne semblerait pas y avoir de raison pour que l'article 1011 du Code Civil ne vienne pas prot\u00e9ger les personnes incapables de donner un consentement valable de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu'il prot\u00e8ge les mineurs, les interdits et les femmes mari\u00e9es. (Voir Dalloz\u2014R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, Vol. VIII\u2014Vo. Nullit\u00e9\u2014n08 63, 64, 65):\nLes jugements et la doctrine qu'on y trouve sont d'abord \u00e0 l'effet que \"pour savoir si la chose re\u00e7ue a tourn\u00e9 au profit de l'incapable, il faut se reporter, non au moment du contrat, mais au moment o\u00f9 l'action en nullit\u00e9 ou en rescision est intent\u00e9e; que c'est \u00e0 la partie qui a contract\u00e9 avec l'incapable qu'incombe la charge de prouver que ce qu'il a pay\u00e9 a tourn\u00e9 \u00e0 son profit\"; mais surtout que \"les r\u00e8gles ci-dessus s'appliquent \u00e0 tous les incapables. Ainsi l'art. 1312 est applicable: \u2026 au mineur \u00e9mancip\u00e9 comme au mineur en tutelle. Jug\u00e9, en cons\u00e9quence, que le mineur \u00e9mancip\u00e9 qui a vendu, sans l'assentiment de son curateur, un mobilier d'une valeur consid\u00e9rable ne peut \u00eatre condamn\u00e9 ni \u00e0 la restitution du prix, ni \u00e0 des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, alors qu'il n'a commis aucune faute et que le prix ne lui a pas personnellement profit\u00e9\" (D.P. 80.1.61).\nLa r\u00e8gle s'applique \u00e9galement \"\u00e0 l'individu pourvu d'un conseil judiciaire\" (Huc, t. 8, n\u00b0 214; Baudry-Lacantinerie et Barde, t. 3, n\u00b0 1974).\nPlaniol (Trait\u00e9 \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire de Droit Civil, 6e \u00e9d., tome 1, n\u00b0 2110) donne une d\u00e9finition du \"faible d'esprit\". D'apr\u00e8s lui, on appelle ainsi \"celui dont les facult\u00e9s sont affaiblies sans qu'il y ait perte totale de la raison et qui, par suite, ne peut pas \u00eatre interdit\u2026 chez ces personnes, c'est la facult\u00e9 de vouloir qui est alt\u00e9r\u00e9e plus que celle de comprendre\".\nEt dans Juris-Classeur Civil, sous les articles 488 \u00e0 577 du Code Napol\u00e9on, en la troisi\u00e8me partie: de l'interdiction judiciaire, le num\u00e9ro 293 s'exprime comme suit:\nLe consentement libre et conscient \u00e9tant l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de l'obligation, l'acte pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 l'interdiction pourra toujours, m\u00eame quand la d\u00e9bilit\u00e9 mentale de son auteur n'est pas habituelle ou n'est pas notoire, et m\u00eame en l'absence de toute demande en interdiction, \u00eatre annul\u00e9 si cet auteur se trouvait, au moment m\u00eame de la passation de l'acte, priv\u00e9 de ses facult\u00e9s intellectuelles;\net cette proposition est appuy\u00e9e sur de nombreuses autorit\u00e9s auxquelles on r\u00e9f\u00e8re.\nEt, au num\u00e9ro 287, dans la m\u00eame compilation (Juris-Classeur Civil), se lit ce qui suit: \"\u2026cette preuve (de d\u00e9bilit\u00e9 mentale) est faite par la d\u00e9monstration d'un \u00e9tat habituel d'o\u00f9 cette incapacit\u00e9 r\u00e9sulterait\".\nNous n'avons pas \u00e0 envisager la pr\u00e9sente affaire comme si nous si\u00e9gions en premi\u00e8re instance. Le juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, qui a eu l'avantage de suivre l'enqu\u00eate et d'entendre les t\u00e9moins, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis que le demandeur-appelant avait \"\u00e9tabli hors de tout doute que Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi a \u00e9t\u00e9 une d\u00e9bile mentale depuis sa naissance. Sa faiblesse d'esprit \u00e9tait apparente, continue et notoire. Elle n'a jamais eu l'intelligence n\u00e9cessaire pour donner un consentement valable \u00e0 l'acte dont la validit\u00e9 m\u00eame est pr\u00e9sentement contest\u00e9e\". Il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que Mlle Rosconi \"n'a jamais eu d'intervalles lucides au cours de son existence\". Pour appr\u00e9cier l'\u00e9tat de d\u00e9mence au moment de la transaction, l'honorable juge s'est appuy\u00e9 sur l'arr\u00eat Re Cloutier v. les h\u00e9ritiers de jeu Albert Gagn\u00e9 3: \"\u2026 que la doctrine et les auteurs enseignent que la mission du juge se r\u00e9duit uniquement \u00e0 rechercher si au moment o\u00f9 l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 le disposant jouissait de sa raison \u2026\"; \"\u2026 qu'il s'agit d'une question de fait pure et simple, fond\u00e9e sur les t\u00e9moignages rapport\u00e9s \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate et, apr\u00e8s en avoir fait une analyse minutieuse\", il ne peut en arriver \"\u00e0 une autre conclusion que Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi \u00e9tait d\u00e9mente et incapable de distinguer entre les avantages ou les d\u00e9savantages contenus dans l'acte attaqu\u00e9\" (McDonough v. Barry 4. La Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) n'a pas mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 ces d\u00e9cisions sur les faits. Elle a bien dit qu'il n'y avait pas de preuve de notori\u00e9t\u00e9, mais, comme nous l'avons vu, elle ne s'est nullement prononc\u00e9e sur l'existence des conditions pr\u00e9vues par l'article 986 C.C.\nNotre Cour, si\u00e9geant comme second tribunal d'appel, n'intervient que tr\u00e8s rarement pour \u00e9carter l'avis prononc\u00e9 sur les faits par le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance; mais, surtout, elle ne met pas cet avis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 lorsqu'elle trouve dans la preuve une justification de cet avis, m\u00eame si, appel\u00e9e \u00e0 se prononcer, lors de l'enqu\u00eate en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, elle d\u00e9clare parfois que peut-\u00eatre elle ne serait pas arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion.\nOr, ici, il me para\u00eet indiscutable que l'on peut trouver amplement dans les t\u00e9moignages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus, experts et autres, pour justifier sur ce point l'opinion du premier juge.\nSi l'on accepte les t\u00e9moignages des m\u00e9decins \u00e9minents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus dans cette cause, l'on doit en conclure que Mlle Rosconi \u00e9tait atteinte d'une d\u00e9bilit\u00e9 c\u00e9r\u00e9brale cong\u00e9nitale et qu'elle \u00e9tait donc dans un \u00e9tat habituel d'incapacit\u00e9 mentale. Cela rencontre les citations tir\u00e9es de Juris-Classeur Civil qui n'exigent pas, pour l'application de l'article 986, que la d\u00e9bilit\u00e9 mentale soit notoire, ni m\u00eame qu'elle soit habituelle, pourvu qu'il soit prouv\u00e9 que, lors de la passation de l'acte, son auteur \u00e9tait priv\u00e9 de ses facult\u00e9s intellectuelles; et qui ajoutent que la preuve en est faite \"par la d\u00e9monstration d'un \u00e9tat habituel d'o\u00f9 cette incapacit\u00e9 r\u00e9sulterait\".\nSans doute, en l'absence d'interdiction, celui qui veut opposer l'acte \u00e0 la personne atteinte de faiblesse d'esprit, au sens de l'article 986 C.C., est admis \u00e0 prouver que l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 au cours d'un intervalle lucide; mais c'est \u00e0 lui que le fardeau incombe, et ici, comme l'a trouv\u00e9 le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, \"les d\u00e9fenderesses n'ont pu prouver que l'\u00e9tat de la disposante pr\u00e9sentait des intervalles lucides au temps de la transaction\".\nJ'ai voulu expliquer, peut-\u00eatre un peu longuement, la fa\u00e7on dont j'envisage cette cause du point de vue des articles 335 et 986 du Code Civil, \u00e0 raison du fait que ce n'est pas ainsi que l'affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e en Cour d'Appel. Pour ma part, en tout respect et en l'esp\u00e8ce, je n'attache pas d'importance \u00e0 l'application de l'article 335, et, pour les besoins de la cause, je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 admettre que l'appelant n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 prouver que \"la cause de l'interdiction de Mlle Rosconi existait notoirement \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 ces actes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits\", car il me suffit d'arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a eu raison d'appliquer ici l'article 986 du Code.\nMais il reste quand m\u00eame la question subsidiaire soulev\u00e9e par l'honorable Juge en chef L\u00e9tourneau.\nLa d\u00e9claration en cette cause se contente d'all\u00e9guer l'\u00e9tat mental et la faiblesse d'esprit de Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi et qu'elle \u00e9tait incapable de donner un consentement valable. Le demandeur, en sa qualit\u00e9 de curateur, a conclu \u00e0 ce que le contrat de pr\u00eat, dont il est question, soit annul\u00e9 et r\u00e9sili\u00e9, et qu'il soit enjoint au registrateur de radier l'enregistrement de ce contrat. Et c'est tout.\nLa d\u00e9fense \u00e9crite se contente de nier les faits; elle all\u00e8gue la bonne foi de la d\u00e9fenderesse Yvonne Dubois et elle conclut, purement et simplement, \u00e0 ce que le demandeur es-qualit\u00e9 soit d\u00e9bout\u00e9 des fins de son action. Les autres pi\u00e8ces de proc\u00e9dure (r\u00e9ponse, r\u00e9plique et duplique) n'ajoutent rien \u00e0 ces deux pi\u00e8ces initiales. Donc, ni la demande ni la d\u00e9fense ne fait allusion au remboursement de la somme de $4,000 que Mlle Rosconi avait re\u00e7ue. Mais si, comme je le crois, il est exact de dire que ce remboursement \u00e9tait une condition pr\u00e9alable du droit de demander l'annulation du contrat, c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 la demande qu'il incombait d'offrir la somme re\u00e7ue par la d\u00e9claration elle-m\u00eame et d'en faire le d\u00e9p\u00f4t avec le rapport de l'action; sans quoi, l'action ne pouvait \u00eatre maintenue, m\u00eame si aucune d\u00e9fense n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 produite.\nPar l'application de l'article 1146 C.C., ce serait le devoir des intim\u00e9es de prouver \"que la chose pay\u00e9e a tourn\u00e9 au profit\" des appelants. Mais cet article parle de d\u00e9biteur et de cr\u00e9ancier et l'on pourrait peut-\u00eatre objecter qu'il ne s'applique pas ici, vu que, pour ce cas particulier, nous avons l'article 1011 C.C.\nJe ne crois pas qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si le contrat consenti par une personne qui, \"\u00e0 raison de la faiblesse de son esprit, est incapable de donner un consentement va- lable\", au sens de l'article 986 du Code, comporte une nullit\u00e9 de droit, comme l'enseigne Planiol, ou simplement une nullit\u00e9 relative. Mon coll\u00e8gue, l'honorable juge Taschereau, \u00e9tudie \u00e0 fond cette question dans ses notes, que j'ai eu l'avantage de consulter, et je n'ai rien \u00e0 ajouter \u00e0 ce qu'il dit sur ce sujet. Il est certain que le contrat consenti par un mineur ou un interdit pour prodigalit\u00e9 est, d'apr\u00e8s l'article 987 C.C., d'une nullit\u00e9 relative dans le sens que seuls ils sont autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 invoquer leur incapacit\u00e9 pour faire mettre le contrat de c\u00f4t\u00e9. S'ils ne s'en pr\u00e9valent pas, le contrat subsiste et lie ceux qui ont contract\u00e9 avec eux. Il est m\u00eame susceptible d'\u00eatre confirm\u00e9 par le mineur qui atteint sa majorit\u00e9, ou par l'interdit pour prodigalit\u00e9 dont l'interdiction est mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nPour les fins de la discussion dans le pr\u00e9sent litige, l'on peut prendre pour acquit que la nullit\u00e9 est \u00e9galement relative, ainsi que l'enseigne M. Mignault, dans le cas des autres incapables \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s aux articles 984 et 986 du Code, malgr\u00e9 que l'article 987 limite aux mineurs et aux interdits pour prodigalit\u00e9 le pr\u00e9cepte que l'incapacit\u00e9 est \u00e9tablie en faveur de ces derniers, ce qui, de prime abord, implique que dans les autres cas chacune des parties contractantes pourrait se pr\u00e9valoir de cette incapacit\u00e9.\nMais, du moment que l'incapacit\u00e9 est invoqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 obtenir l'annulation du contrat, il ne me para\u00eet pas discutable que la r\u00e8gle, si l'annulation est prononc\u00e9e, est que les parties contractantes doivent \u00eatre remises dans l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient auparavant; et je crois que cette r\u00e8gle est de rigueur, qu'il s'agisse d'une nullit\u00e9 absolue de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que s'il s'agit seulement d'une nullit\u00e9 relative.\nCette r\u00e8gle souffre l'exception contenue \u00e0 l'article 1011 C.C. en faveur des mineurs, des interdits (et, cette fois, elle n'est pas limit\u00e9e aux interdits pour prodigalit\u00e9) et des femmes mari\u00e9es.\nDans ces trois cas d'exception ces personnes sont admises \u00e0 se faire restituer contre leur contrat et le remboursement de ce qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 en cons\u00e9quence de ces engagements n'en peut \u00eatre exig\u00e9 par leurs co-contractants \"\u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit prouv\u00e9 que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi pay\u00e9 a tourn\u00e9 \u00e0 leur profit\". Sur cette question, le dossier qu'on nous a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 est absolument muet. Le point se r\u00e9sout donc \u00e0 savoir \u00e0 qui il incombait de le soulever.\nL'on admet g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement que, dans les cas d'exception que nous venons de mentionner, c'est \u00e0 l'autre partie contractante qu'il importe de prouver que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 \u00e0 l'incapable a tourn\u00e9 \u00e0 son profit. Ici, les intim\u00e9es n'ont pas fait cette preuve et il en r\u00e9sulterait qu'elles ne peuvent r\u00e9clamer la restitution de la somme de $4,000 qu'elles ont pr\u00eat\u00e9e.\nMais si, au contraire, Mlle Rosconi ne peut se r\u00e9clamer de l'exception contenue \u00e0 l'article 1011, il s'ensuit qu'elle tombe sous la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qu'elle ne pouvait, ni par elle-m\u00eame, ni par son curateur, conclure \u00e0 l'annulation du contrat sans offrir le montant qu'elle a re\u00e7u en cons\u00e9quence.\nIl faut bien avouer que cette s\u00e9rie d'articles 984, 986, 987 et 1011 C.C. aurait gagn\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre r\u00e9dig\u00e9e d'une fa\u00e7on plus claire et que les codificateurs auraient bien d\u00fb nous faire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier un peu plus de leur confidence.\nDevant le texte explicite de l'article 1011, qui limite l'exception aux mineurs, aux interdits et aux femmes mari\u00e9es, la seule interpr\u00e9tation juridique est que les autres incapables ne peuvent invoquer cette exception. Pourquoi, en effet, proc\u00e9der \u00e0 cette \u00e9num\u00e9ration alors que, si l'on voulait que cet article s'\u00e9tende \u00e0 tous les incapables, les codificateurs ne se soient pas born\u00e9s tout simplement \u00e0 dire: \"Lorsque les incapables sont admis en ces qualit\u00e9s \u2026 etc\u2026\"?\nJe ne vois pas sur quoi l'on pourrait se baser pour dire que, malgr\u00e9 que trois cat\u00e9gories d'incapables sont sp\u00e9cifiquement mentionn\u00e9es, l'article doit n\u00e9anmoins s'appliquer \u00e0 tous les incapables et contenir un principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nLe principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral c'est que les parties doivent \u00eatre remises dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tat qu'elles \u00e9taient auparavant. Les simples \"faibles d'esprit\" ne sont pas mentionn\u00e9s dans l'exception de l'article 1011, et force nous est donc de d\u00e9cider cette cause conform\u00e9ment au principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et de conclure que, pour obtenir l'annulation de son contrat, Mlle Rosconi, ou son curateur, \u00e9tait tenue en instituant son action d'offrir \u00e0 la partie adverse le montant de $4,000 qu'elle avait re\u00e7u de cette derni\u00e8re. Dans les circonstances, je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 et que les appelants doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9s de leur action avec d\u00e9pens.\nTaschereau, J.:\u2014Les faits de ce litige ont \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement rapport\u00e9s ailleurs, et il est en cons\u00e9quence inutile d'y revenir. Je me bornerai donc \u00e0 analyser uniquement l'aspect l\u00e9gal de la question, et \u00e0 tirer des textes les conclusions qui s'imposent.\nTrois articles du Code Civil doivent particuli\u00e8rement retenir notre attention. Ce sont les articles 335, 986 et 1011 C.C. Les autres qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9s, ne peuvent servir qu'\u00e0 aider \u00e0 leur interpr\u00e9tation.\nLa premi\u00e8re pr\u00e9tention des demandeurs-appelants est \u00e0 l'effet que la transaction intervenue entre Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi le 24 juillet 1942, devant Me \u00c9mile Beauchemin, N.P., et en vertu de laquelle elle a reconnu devoir \u00e0 mademoiselle Yvonne Dubois, d\u00e9fenderesse-intim\u00e9e, la somme de $4,000, que cette derni\u00e8re lui avait pr\u00eat\u00e9e, est nulle, de m\u00eame que le transport d'une cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire, fait en garantie. Le motif all\u00e9gu\u00e9 est qu'au moment o\u00f9 l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9, Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi \u00e9tait dans un \u00e9tat d'imb\u00e9cillit\u00e9 constant et notoire, qui justifie l'application de l'article 335 C.C. qui se lit ainsi:\n335. Les actes ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l'interdiction prononc\u00e9e pour imb\u00e9cillit\u00e9, d\u00e9mence ou fureur, peuvent cependant \u00eatre annul\u00e9s, si la cause de l'interdiction existait notoirement \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 ces actes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits.\nJos\u00e9phine Rosconi a \u00e9t\u00e9 interdite pour prodigalit\u00e9 le 1er juin 1944, et ce n'est que le 13 avril 1945, soit pr\u00e8s de trois ans apr\u00e8s la signature de l'acte que l'on veut maintenant faire annuler, qu'elle le fut pour imb\u00e9cillit\u00e9. Pour r\u00e9ussir, il est manifeste que les demandeurs-appelants doivent d\u00e9montrer en premier lieu, que les causes qui justifiaient l'interdiction en avril 1945, non seulement existaient quand l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 en 1942, mais qu'elles existaient \"notoirement\" \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. C'est subordonneraient \u00e0 ces deux conditions que le juge au proc\u00e8s pouvait, sans y \u00eatre tenu, prononcer l'annulation de l'acte.\nIl est inutile, je crois, d'analyser toute la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, afin de d\u00e9terminer l'\u00e9tat mental de Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi, tant au moment de l'interdiction que durant la p\u00e9riode qui l'a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e. Malgr\u00e9 qu'il semble qu'elle ait souffert de d\u00e9bilit\u00e9 mentale, et comme le dit M. le docteur Legrand, que son jugement n'\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 normalement, je crois que ces consid\u00e9rations ne peuvent pas influencer le r\u00e9sultat final de cette cause. Le seul fait de l'imb\u00e9cillit\u00e9 n'est pas un facteur suffisant pour que l'acte soit frapp\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9. Il faut n\u00e9cessairement que cette imb\u00e9cilit\u00e9 soit notoire pour justifier les tribunaux d'appliquer l'article 335 C.C. La notori\u00e9t\u00e9 d'un fait comme celui-l\u00e0, ne se prouve pas par quelques personnes qui t\u00e9moignent de faits isol\u00e9s dont elles ont eu connaissance, ou par le t\u00e9moignage d'experts, si savants qu'ils soient, et qui font part des constatations que leur science leur permet de d\u00e9celer. Pour qu'un fait soit notoire au sens de la loi, il faut qu'il soit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement connu, il faut qu'il soit su qu'il existe, non seulement par quelques intimes ou quelques hommes de science, mais aussi par les habitants du voisinage ou de la localit\u00e9. Comme le dit avec raison M. le Juge Bissonnette de la Cour d'Appel: \"En un mot, c'est la commune renomm\u00e9e qui fait la notori\u00e9t\u00e9 et qui pointe du doigt \u00e0 tous et pour tout, le malheureux qu'on dit et qu'on juge \u00eatre priv\u00e9 d'un usage suffisant de ses facult\u00e9s\". Je ne doute pas que la notori\u00e9t\u00e9 exig\u00e9e par l'article 335 pour imb\u00e9cilit\u00e9, d\u00e9mence ou fureur, doit avoir au moins le m\u00eame caract\u00e8re que celui que le Code Civil (art. 336c) requiert lorsqu'il s'agit d'un ivrogne d'habitude.\nLa raison est \u00e9vidente. Cette notori\u00e9t\u00e9 est la seule protection offerte \u00e0 la personne qui se propose de contracter. La publicit\u00e9 qui est donn\u00e9e aux interdits, pour d\u00e9mence, fureur, imb\u00e9cilit\u00e9, ivrognerie, prodigalit\u00e9 (C.C. 333 et 336q) ou aux autres incapables par le moyen des registres de l'\u00e9tat civil, est aux yeux de la loi suffisante pour mettre en garde ceux qui d\u00e9sirent contracter. Mais c'est uniquement la notori\u00e9t\u00e9 qui doit avertir celui qui veut contracter avec un d\u00e9ment ou un imb\u00e9cile qui n'est pas encore interdit. Lorsqu'elle existe cette notori\u00e9t\u00e9, le contractant agira \u00e0 ses risques et p\u00e9rils. Comme le disent Colin et Capitant (Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, 11\u00e8me Ed., Vol. 1, page 687):\nS'il y avait en effet, notori\u00e9t\u00e9 de la d\u00e9mense habituelle, celui qui a contract\u00e9 avec l'ali\u00e9n\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 au moins imprudent; il est juste qu'il supporte les cons\u00e9quences de cette imprudence.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, il n'y a aucune preuve de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 au dossier, rien qui pouvait faire soup\u00e7onner l'existence d'un \u00e9tat d'imb\u00e9cillit\u00e9 chez Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi. L'intim\u00e9e n'avait jamais vu cette derni\u00e8re, ne la connaissait pas, et c'est par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'un notaire qu'elle a pr\u00eat\u00e9 cette somme de $4,000. Annuler le pr\u00e9sent acte, serait s\u00e9rieusement mettre en p\u00e9ril la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des pr\u00eats hypoth\u00e9caires, consentis de bonne foi, dans le cours normal des op\u00e9rations financi\u00e8res. C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour \u00e9carter ce danger que le l\u00e9gislateur exige cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de notori\u00e9t\u00e9, dont la preuve incombe \u00e0 l'incapable ou \u00e0 son repr\u00e9sentant, et qui constitue la mise en garde n\u00e9cessaire.\nLes appelants ont \u00e9galement soutenu que Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi ne pouvait, en raison de la faiblesse de son esprit; donner un consentement valable, et invoquent l'article 986 du Code Civil qui se lit ainsi:\n986. Sont incapables de contracter:\nLes mineurs, dans les cas et suivant les dispositions contenues dans ce Code;\nLes interdits;\nLes femmes mari\u00e9es, except\u00e9 dans les cas sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s par la loi;\nCeux \u00e0 qui des dispositions sp\u00e9ciales de la loi d\u00e9fendent de contracter \u00e0 raison de leurs relations ensemble, ou de l'objet du contrat;\nLes personnes ali\u00e9n\u00e9es ou souffrant d'une aberration temporaire caus\u00e9e par maladie, accident, ivresse ou autre cause, ou qui, \u00e0 raison de la faiblesse de leur esprit, sont incapables de donner un consentement valable;\n(Ceux qui sont frapp\u00e9s de d\u00e9gradation civique.)\nCet article qui correspond \u00e0 l'article 1124 du Code Napol\u00e9on, en diff\u00e8re cependant en ce qu'il contient les paragraphes 3 et 5 qui n'existent pas en France. On a cru voir dans ce paragraphe 5, ajout\u00e9 par les codificateurs, une contradiction avec les termes de l'article 335 C.C. En effet, comment concilier 335 C.C. qui dit que les actes faits ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 l'interdiction peuvent \u00eatre annul\u00e9s, si les causes d'interdiction existaient notoirement \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits, avec 986 (5) C.C. qui veut que les personnes faibles d'esprit soient incapables de contracter, sans qu'entre l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de notori\u00e9t\u00e9, et sans qu'il soit question d'interdiction?\nMais, cette contradiction est plus apparente que r\u00e9elle.\nDans une cause comme celle qui nous occupe, il faut en premier lieu consid\u00e9rer l'article 335, qui est une loi particuli\u00e8re, de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'article 986 (5) qui d'une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale traite des incapables. Il y a entre les deux textes des diff\u00e9rences fondamentales qui aideront \u00e0 en arriver \u00e0 une conclusion. Ainsi, en vertu de 335, il faut qu'il y ait interdiction, que l'acte de l'incapable soit ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 l'interdiction, et que les causes d'interdiction aient exist\u00e9 notoirement au moment o\u00f9 l'acte attaqu\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9. En vertu de 986 (5) l'acte sera mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 s'il y a d\u00e9ficience mentale au moment o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9, mais si la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l'incapable a agi dans un moment d'intervalle lucide, son acte sera tenu pour valide. Il n'est question ni de notori\u00e9t\u00e9, ni d'interdiction. Ainsi donc, si un incapable, ou son repr\u00e9sentant \u00e9tablit la d\u00e9ficience mentale, l'interdiction, l'acte ant\u00e9rieur, alors qu'existait la cause notoire d'interdiction, le contrat sera annul\u00e9 vu que toutes les conditions de l'article 335 auront \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies. Il serait illogique de faire jouer en ce cas l'article 986 (5), et de prendre en consid\u00e9ration la preuve que l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9 dans un moment d'intervalle lucide. Il sera suffisant qu'il soit \u00e9tabli que l'ali\u00e9nation mentale existait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque du contrat g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement. (Mignault, Vol. 5, page 195.)\nSi la preuve n'\u00e9tablit pas la notori\u00e9t\u00e9, le recours de l'incapable ou de son repr\u00e9sentant n'est pas \u00e9puis\u00e9, car il a encore \u00e9videmment le droit de se pr\u00e9valoir de la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale concernant les incapables, contenue dans l'article 986 et particuli\u00e8rement au paragraphe 5. Mais la preuve sera plus on\u00e9reuse, et la Cour alors ne sera pas satisfaite de la preuve d'une d\u00e9ficience mentale qui a exist\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, mais il faudra qu'il lui soit d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'au moment o\u00f9 l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9, le contractant n'avait pas la jouissance de ses facult\u00e9s mentales. Dans le cas de l'article 335, quand la d\u00e9ficience mentale et la notori\u00e9t\u00e9 sont \u00e9tablies, il y a pr\u00e9somption d'incapacit\u00e9 au moment de la passation du contrat; au contraire, quand 986 (5) trouve son application, il y a pr\u00e9somption de capacit\u00e9, ce qui d'ailleurs est la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, sauf le cas o\u00f9 la preuve d'ali\u00e9nation mentale est telle qu'elle fait na\u00eetre la pr\u00e9somption d'absence d'intervalle lucide. (Mignault, Vol. 5, p. 195) (Phelan v. Murphy), 5.\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli dans la pr\u00e9sente cause que l'imb\u00e9cillit\u00e9 de Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi n'avait pas le caract\u00e8re de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 voulu pour que les appelants puissent invoquer l'article 335. Quel est donc maintenant le recours que leur donne l'article 986? La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le-t-elle folie au moment o\u00f9 le contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9, ou une folie permanente telle qu'on ne puisse supposer la possibilit\u00e9 d'un intervalle de lucidit\u00e9? Sur ce point, la preuve est tr\u00e8s douteuse, mais je ne crois pas qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer si oui ou non il existait un intervalle de lucidit\u00e9 pour en arriver \u00e0 une conclusion.\nIl ne fait pas de doute que, quand l'action en annulation invoque les motifs pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'article 335, l'acte n'est pas nul de plein droit mais n'est qu'annulable. Ces actes, dit l'article 335, \"peuvent cependant \u00eatre annul\u00e9s\". C'est d'ailleurs ce que la jurisprudence de cette province a consacr\u00e9 et particuli\u00e8rement dans la cause de Normandin v. Nadon 6, o\u00f9 M. le Juge Archambault dans un jugement tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9, fait une revue de la jurisprudence et conclut avec raison que la nullit\u00e9 des actes faits, soit par l'interdit, soit par la personne souffrant d'ali\u00e9nation mentale notoire, n'est pas absolue, mais uniquement relative, et, comme elle est \u00e9tablie en faveur de ces deux classes de personnes, elle ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e que par elles-m\u00eames ou leurs repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux.\nLe m\u00eame principe doit, je crois, s'appliquer au paragraphe 5 de l'article 986, et dans les deux cas, qu'il s'agisse de l'article 335 ou de l'article 986, paragraphe 5, la nullit\u00e9 n'est que relative. Il serait en effet \u00e9trange que l'acte ne soit qu'annulable sous 335, dans le cas o\u00f9 il y a interdiction et que la notori\u00e9t\u00e9 est \u00e9tablie, et que la nullit\u00e9 serait absolue s'il n'y avait pas d'interdiction ni de notori\u00e9t\u00e9. Il suffira de se rappeler que dans les deux cas la demande en annulation ne peut \u00eatre faite que par l'incapable lui-m\u00eame ou par son repr\u00e9sentant, ce qui ne serait pas le cas, si la nullit\u00e9 avait un caract\u00e8re diff\u00e9rent et \u00e9tait absolue. Tant que semblable action n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e par l'incapable, l'autre partie contractante demeure li\u00e9e, et est tenue de remplir les obligations que lui impose son contrat.\nLes caract\u00e8res de la nullit\u00e9 absolue sont bien connus. Cette nullit\u00e9 est imm\u00e9diate, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'elle frappe l'acte aussit\u00f4t qu'il est fait. Toute personne int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 faire constater cette nullit\u00e9 peut s'en pr\u00e9valoir, et celle-ci ne peut pas \u00eatre couverte par la confirmation de l'un des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s. Au contraire, Planiol enseigne (Droit Civil, Vol. 1, 9\u00e8me Ed., p. 128) que les vices de consentement comme la violence, l'erreur, le dol, et l'incapacit\u00e9 de l'un des auteurs de l'acte, sont les principales causes qui rendent un acte annulable. Dans ce cas, la nullit\u00e9 n'est pas imm\u00e9diate, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'elle produit ses effets tant que n'est pas rendue la sentence du juge. L'action n'est pas r\u00e9serv\u00e9e \u00e0 tout le monde, mais seulement \u00e0 l'incapable ou \u00e0 la personne dont le consentement a \u00e9t\u00e9 vici\u00e9. C'est un moyen de protection pour une personne d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Cette nullit\u00e9 relative peut \u00e9videmment se couvrir par l'effet d'une confirmation subs\u00e9quente. Si les actes \u00e9taient inexistants, ils n'existeraient pour personne, mais pourtant ces contrats subsistent au moins quant \u00e0 l'autre partie contractante, qui ne peut jamais demander la nullit\u00e9 et qui doit attendre l'action de l'incapable ou de son repr\u00e9sentant.\nTous les auteurs fran\u00e7ais confirment cette th\u00e9orie que l'acte d'un incapable n'est pas frapp\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9 absolue, mais bien de nullit\u00e9 relative.\nAinsi, c'est la doctrine exprim\u00e9e dans les Pandectes Fran\u00e7aises (R\u00e9pertoire \"Obligations\", p. 694, n\u00b0 6280):\nDans les diverses hypoth\u00e8ses o\u00f9 la nullit\u00e9 est fond\u00e9e sur l'incapacit\u00e9, elle n'est que relative, et ne peut \u00eatre propos\u00e9e par les personnes avec lesquelles l'incapable a contract\u00e9.\nDans Dalloz, Nouveau R\u00e9pertoire (Vol. 3, p. 260, n\u00b0 15) Vide:\nIl y a nullit\u00e9 absolue lorsqu'il y a d\u00e9faut de consentement, lorsque l'acte est illicite ou immoral par son objet ou par ses causes, lorsqu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entour\u00e9 des r\u00e8gles de forme imp\u00e9rativement exig\u00e9es par la loi; il y a nullit\u00e9 relative s'il y a vice de consentement ou incapacit\u00e9, ou parfois l\u00e9sion, s'il y a absence de causes ou fausses causes.\nEt dans le m\u00eame auteur (n\u00b0 24, page 260):\nLorsque la nullit\u00e9 est relative, seule la personne d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, que l'inefficacit\u00e9 de l'acte est destin\u00e9e \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger, a le droit de pr\u00e9tendre que l'acte doit demeurer d\u00e9nu\u00e9 d'effet; il lui appartient de voir si elle veut ou non demander la nullit\u00e9, et c'est pourquoi l'on dit que l'acte est annulable.\nPlaniol (Droit Civil, Tome 1, 3\u00e8me Ed., Revue par Ripert, 1946 p. 152) traitant du caract\u00e8re de la nullit\u00e9 relative, dit ce qui suit:\nLa nullit\u00e9 est dite relative lorsque l'inefficacit\u00e9 de l'acte est destin\u00e9e \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger une personne d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Il appartient \u00e0 cette personne de voir si elle veut ou non demander la nullit\u00e9. Il est certain ici que la nullit\u00e9 ne se produit pas de plein droit. Elle doit \u00eatre demand\u00e9e en justice et prononc\u00e9e par jugement.\nCette doctrine n'est d'ailleurs pas nouvelle. D\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 la fin du si\u00e8cle dernier, Baudry-Lacantinerie dans son Droit Civil (Vol. 2, 4\u00e8me Ed., \u00e0 la page 806) disait:\nLe contrat nul ou annulable est celui qui r\u00e9unit tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels \u00e0 sa formation, mais qui renferme un vice susceptible d'amener son annulation par la justice.\nOn doit consid\u00e9rer comme infirmant la validit\u00e9 du contrat, sans l'emp\u00eacher toutefois de se former,\n10 Les simples vices du consentement, \u00e0 savoir: la violence, le dol et l'erreur, auxquels la loi assimile la l\u00e9sion;\n20 Le d\u00e9faut de capacit\u00e9 chez la partie qui s'oblige. L'incapacit\u00e9 n'est en effet qu'une cause de nullit\u00e9 ou d'annulabilit\u00e9.\nLa doctrine ci-dessus est aussi la doctrine enseign\u00e9e par Mignault, Vol. 5, \u00e0 la page 196, o\u00f9 l'on verra qu'il s'agisse des interdits ou d'une personne ali\u00e9n\u00e9e, l'incapable seul peut demander l'annulation du contrat, \"dans un cas, comme dans l'autre, la nullit\u00e9 est relative\".\nIl suit n\u00e9cessairement de cela que les appelants, assumant que l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 dans un moment de d\u00e9ficience mentale, ne peuvent obtenir autre chose que de remettre les parties dans l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 le contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9. Or, comme l'intim\u00e9e a pr\u00eat\u00e9 la somme de $4,000, et s'est fait transporter, en garantie, une cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire qui \u00e9tait due \u00e0 Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi, il s'ensuit qu'on aurait d\u00fb lui offrir le remboursement de la somme de $4,000 avant qu'on demande au tribunal de prononcer la nullit\u00e9 du contrat. Le droit que peuvent avoir les demandeurs-appelants de faire annuler le contrat est subordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 leur obligation de rembourser. Il faut, lorsque la nullit\u00e9 est relative, offrir ce que l'on a re\u00e7u, avant de r\u00e9clamer ce qu'on a donn\u00e9. Si la loi prot\u00e8ge l'incapable, ce n'est pas pour lui assurer un enrichissement, mais plut\u00f4t pour lui \u00e9pargner une perte.\nSur ce point la doctrine n'a jamais vari\u00e9. Aubry et Rau (Vol. 4, 5\u00e8me Ed. page 428) enseignent que:\nL'annulation ou la rescision d'un engagement contractuel oblige les parties \u00e0 se restituer respectivement ce qu'elles ont re\u00e7u ou per\u00e7u par suite ou en vertu du contrat d'o\u00f9 proc\u00e9dait cet engagement. Laurent (Vol. 19, page 64, Principes de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais) s'exprime ainsi:\nSi le contrait annul\u00e9 n'a re\u00e7u aucune ex\u00e9cution, l'effet de l'annulation est tr\u00e8s simple; il n'y a plus de contrat, donc plus d'obligation, ni cr\u00e9ancier, ni d\u00e9biteur. Mais le contrat peut avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9; dans ce cas, les parties doivent \u00eatre remises au m\u00eame \u00e9tat que si l'obligation n'avait pas exist\u00e9; chacune d'elles doit donc rendre ce qu'elle a re\u00e7u en vertu du contrat.\nDemolombe (Trait\u00e9 des Contrats, Vol. 6, page 172, n\u00b0 171) enseigne:\nEt \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des parties, la cons\u00e9quence en est qu'elles sont tenues respectivement de se restituer ce qu'elles ont re\u00e7u par suite de l'acte, dont la nullit\u00e9 ou la rescision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e.\nLa m\u00eame doctrine se trouve dans Dalloz (Nouveau R\u00e9pertoire, Vol. 3, p. 263, verbo \"nullit\u00e9\", no 60):\nLorsque le contrat, tout en \u00e9tant illicite, n'est pas entach\u00e9 d'immoralit\u00e9, les tribunaux, afin d'assurer le respect de l'ordre public, laissent produire \u00e0 la nullit\u00e9 tous les effets, et admettent la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition qui fera dispara\u00eetre toute trace du contrat conclu.\nBaudry-Lacantinerie (Droit Civil, Vol. 2, 4\u00e8me Ed., page 827, n\u00b0 1171) est aussi d'avis que:\nLa nullit\u00e9 ou la rescision prononc\u00e9e en justice a pour r\u00e9sultat de mettre les choses dans l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient avant la formation de l'obligation annul\u00e9e ou rescind\u00e9e.\nTraitant de l'article 1312, qui correspond \u00e0 notre article 1011 C.C., Dalloz (Codes Annot\u00e9s, 1905, Vol. 3, n\u00b0 10, page 293) dit:\nL'annulation remet les parties au m\u00eame \u00e9tat o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient avant le contrat.\nEt au num\u00e9ro 12:\nDe l\u00e0 il r\u00e9sulte que les parties doivent se restituer respectivement tout ce qu'elles ont re\u00e7u ou tout ce qu'elles ont per\u00e7u en vertu de l'acte, s'il est synallagmatique, ou ce que l'une d'elles a re\u00e7u ou per\u00e7u si l'acte est unilat\u00e9ral.\nLarombi\u00e8re (Th\u00e9orie des Obligations, Vol. 5, page 420) dit \u00e9galement:\nLorsqu'un contrat est annul\u00e9, rescind\u00e9, ou r\u00e9solu, les parties sont remises au m\u00eame et semblable \u00e9tat qu'avant la convention. Chacune d'elles doit faire compte \u00e0 l'autre de ce qu'elle a per\u00e7u.\nEnfin, (Vide: Juris-Classeur Civil, article 1312, Nullit\u00e9 et Rescision des Conventions, n08 1-2-4):\nL'article 1312 traite de l'effet de l'annulation en se pla\u00e7ant au point de vue particulier du remboursement des sommes pay\u00e9es. Par l'effet de l'annulation, les parties se trouvent replac\u00e9es dans la situation o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient avant la convention annul\u00e9e ou rescind\u00e9e \u2026 Il en r\u00e9sulte qu'elles doivent se restituer tout ce qu'elles ont re\u00e7u en vertu de ladite convention.\nCette r\u00e8gle cependant comporte quelques exceptions. Elles sont contenues au Code Napol\u00e9on \u00e0 l'article 1312, et \u00e0 notre Code Civil \u00e0 l'article 1011. L'article 1312 du Code Napol\u00e9on est \u00e0 l'effet, depuis un amendement apport\u00e9 en 1938, que lorsque les mineurs ou les interdits sont admis, en.ces qualit\u00e9s \u00e0 se faire restituer contre leurs engagements, le remboursement de ce qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9, en cons\u00e9quence de ces engagements, pay\u00e9 pendant la minorit\u00e9 ou l'interdiction, ne peut en \u00eatre exig\u00e9, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit prouv\u00e9 que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 a tourn\u00e9 \u00e0 leur profit. Notre article 1011 se lit comme suit:\n1011. Lorsque les mineurs, les interdits ou les femmes mari\u00e9es, sont admis, en ces qualit\u00e9s \u00e0 se faire restituer contre leurs contrats, le remboursement de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9, en cons\u00e9quence de ces engagements, pay\u00e9 pendant la minorit\u00e9, l'interdiction ou le mariage, n'en peut \u00eatre exig\u00e9, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit prouv\u00e9 que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi pay\u00e9 a tourn\u00e9 \u00e0 leur profit.\nCes articles 1312 du Code Napol\u00e9on et 1011 de notre Code Civil, confirment clairement la r\u00e8gle, que les parties doivent \u00eatre remises au m\u00eame \u00e9tat qu'avant la convention, lorsqu'il y a nullit\u00e9 de cette convention, mais dans certains cas, la loi apporte des exceptions. En France, jusqu'en 1938, cette exception s'appliquait \u00e0 l'interdit, au mineur et \u00e0 la femme mari\u00e9e pour les actes faits pendant la minorit\u00e9, l'interdiction ou le mariage, mais depuis 1938, la femme mari\u00e9e a cess\u00e9 de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de cette exception. Au contraire, ici, tous trois b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient toujours de l'exception pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'article 1011, et lorsque ces incapables mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article ont contract\u00e9 pendant la minorit\u00e9, l'interdiction ou le mariage, le remboursement de ce que les incapables mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article ont pay\u00e9, ne peut \u00eatre exig\u00e9 d'eux, \u00e0 moins que l'autre partie contractante d\u00e9montre que l'incapable a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de la transaction. Il s'agit d'une loi d'exception, et comme le dit Larombi\u00e8re (Th\u00e9orie des Obligations, Vol. 5, \u00e0 la page 420):\nL'article 1312 introduit une exception \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle en faveur des mineurs, des interdits, des femmes mari\u00e9es.\nOn ne peut pas, je crois, \u00e9tendre la port\u00e9e de l'article 1011. Ce serait faire violence au texte qui stipule que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 pendant la minorit\u00e9, l'interdiction ou le ma- riage, ne peut \u00eatre exig\u00e9, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit prouv\u00e9 que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi pay\u00e9 a tourn\u00e9 au profit de l'incapable, et l'appliquer \u00e0 une convention faite par un faible d'esprit ou un imb\u00e9cile avant l'interdiction. Il s'ensuit que lorsqu'il s'agit d'une personne autre qu'un mineur, qu'un interdit ou qu'une femme mari\u00e9e, (ou du cas pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'article 334 C.C.), la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale doit s'appliquer, et l'incapable qui ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie pas de l'exception doit \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 rembourser non pas seulement jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence du montant qui a tourn\u00e9 \u00e0 son profit, mais la totalit\u00e9 du montant qu'il a re\u00e7u comme r\u00e9sultat de la convention.\nLarombi\u00e8re (Th\u00e9orie des Obligations, Vol. 5, \u00e0 la page 428) explique qu'il y aurait de bonnes raisons d'appliquer l'article 1312 du Code Napol\u00e9on, non seulement aux mineurs, aux interdits et aux femmes mari\u00e9es (avant 1938), mais aussi aux autres incapables. Mais, comme ils ne sont pas frapp\u00e9s d'interdiction, la partie qui a contract\u00e9 avec eux est fond\u00e9e \u00e0 exiger le remboursement int\u00e9gral de ce qui leur aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9, ind\u00e9pendamment de l'emploi qu'ils en auraient pu faire. Il compl\u00e8te sa pens\u00e9e en disant que l'on doit tenir compte de la bonne foi de l'autre partie contractante qui a contract\u00e9 dans l'ignorance de leur incapacit\u00e9 naturelle. Comment, en effet, pouvait l'autre partie contractante exiger la justification d'une incapacit\u00e9, sur laquelle aucun soup\u00e7on ne devait s'\u00e9lever? Dans la cause qui nous occupe, il est impossible de mettre en doute la bonne foi de mademoiselle Dubois.\nAu cours de l'argument, on a soumis \u00e0 la Cour la proposition qu'en France, en vertu de l'article 1312, on a admis que l'exception s'appliquait \u00e0 la femme mari\u00e9e, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, l'article 1312 du Code Napol\u00e9on comme l'article 1011 de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, ne sont pas limitatifs et doivent comprendre les autres incapables m\u00eame s'ils n'y sont pas express\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9s. On trouve dans Juris-Classeur (supra), plusieurs autorit\u00e9s et plusieurs d\u00e9cisions disant qu'en effet, cette exception doit s'appliquer \u00e0 la femme mari\u00e9e. Mais, toutes ces d\u00e9cisions sont ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 1938, date de l'amendement apport\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 1312, et c'est avec bon droit que Laurent (Vol. 19, n\u00b0 71) s'\u00e9tonne qu'il ait fallu deux d\u00e9cisions de la Cour de Cassation en France, pour appliquer l'exception \u00e0 la femme mari\u00e9e, et pour juger ce que dans le temps, la loi d\u00e9cidait formellement dans l'article 1312, qui met la femme mari\u00e9e sur la m\u00eame ligne que les mineurs et les interdits.\nCette jurisprudence et ces autorit\u00e9s m'am\u00e8nent n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 conclure que lorsqu'une action est institu\u00e9e, comme dans le cas qui nous occupe, par un curateur \u00e0 un interdit pour faire annuler une convention sign\u00e9e avant l'interdiction, par un faible d'esprit ou un imb\u00e9cile, l'on doit n\u00e9cessairement offrir le montant re\u00e7u avant que la nullit\u00e9 du contrat ne puisse \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e. Il est de principe que la demande en nullit\u00e9 ou en rescision suivie d'un jugement, remet les parties en \u00e9tat o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient avant la conclusion de l'acte. Dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, ce r\u00e9sultat ne pourrait \u00eatre obtenu que par les offres et la consignation qu'auraient d\u00fb faire les appelants, de la somme de $4,000. C'est \u00e0 ce prix seulement qu'ils peuvent faire r\u00e9int\u00e9grer dans le patrimoine de mademoiselle Rosconi, la cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire de $4,000, transport\u00e9e en garantie \u00e0 mademoiselle Dubois. (Latreille v. Gouin) 7.\nPour ces raisons, je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours.\nRand, J.:\u2014This appeal raises a question in the law of Quebec relating to the effect of insanity on obligations purporting to have been entered into by a person so afflicted. In disposing of it, I take the fact to be that the deceased was, at the time of making the instrument now questioned, incapable of appreciating its nature or significance, but that her state of low mentality was not notorious in the community in which she lived.\nIn the Civil Law of Rome which is basic to that of France and Quebec, the rule was of the utmost simplicity: all apparent juristic acts of such a person were null; the lack of real consent prevented the operation of law upon what, in fact, had been done. That this rule prevailed in parts of Western Europe is shown by the decision of the Judicial Committee in Molyneux v. Natal Land Company 8, in which the Roman-Dutch law in force in Natal was in ques- tion; and, speaking for the Committee, Sir Henry de Villiers invoked the view of Pothier set forth in his work on Obligatons, s. 51:\u2014\nAll contracts pretended to be made by persons interdicted for insanity, though before interdiction, are null, provided it be shewn that they were insane at the time of the contract, for then insanity alone, and of itself renders them incapable of contracting, independently of the sentence of interdiction, which is merely a declaration of insanity.\nIt is, I think, equally clear that the recovery of any money paid to the incompetent could be only on the principle of unjust enrichment.\nThat underlying law in Quebec has, however, been affected in some detail by provisions of the Civil Code and the conclusion on the controversy before us depends upon the extent and nature of that effect. The relevant articles are Nos. 334, 335, 986, 987 and 1011, the material provisions of which are as follows:\u2014\n334. All acts done subsequently (to interdiction) by the person interdicted for imbecility, madness or insanity, are null;............\n335. Acts anterior to interdiction for imbecility, insanity or madness may nevertheless be set aside, if the cause of such interdiction notoriously existed at the time when these acts were done.\n986. Those legally incapable of contracting are:\u2014\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nInterdicted persons;\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nPersons insane or suffering a temporary derangement of intellect arising from disease, accident, drunkenness or other cause or who by reason of weakness of understanding are unable to give a valid consent;\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n987.............\nParties capable of contracting cannot set up the incapacity of the minors or of the interdicted persons with whom they have contracted.\n1011. When minors, interdicted persons or married women are admitted in these qualities to be relieved from their contracts, the reimbursement of that which has been paid in consequence of these contracts, during minority, interdiction or marriage, cannot be exacted unless it is proved that what has been so paid has turned to their profit.\nAs can be seen, these formulations, apart from 986, do not expressly touch the basic law; but they do embody matter of that law with new elements. For instance, it is not disputed that under art. 334 an act of a person interdicted for insanity is null notwithstanding that it was done in a lucid interval; proof of the latter is excluded as irrelevant. But art. 987 modifies the nullity de plein droit of the earlier day: only the incapable is permitted to raise the question; and there does not seem to be doubt that it is now to be treated as a relative nullity. Again, in interdiction, art. 1011 stipulates that restitution will be open to the capable party only upon his showing that what was advanced has been turned to the benefit of the incapable, which maintains recovery on the footing of unjust enrichment. In the absence of that provision, it would be arguable that the ordinary rule of restitutio in integrum in an action of annulment or rescission would apply.\nTwo questions then arise: does the character of relative nullity thus attributed to an act of apparent obligation by an insane person under interdiction attract the same character to such an act where the insanity comes under interdiction only at a later time? Mignault, Vol. 5 at p. 196 expresses the view that it does, and I have come to the conclusion that he is right. Interdiction, with its public registration, for such a cause is obviously of a higher rank in the legal scale than the cause itself: it subsumes the cause, and it would be illogical to interpret the provision of art. 987 as not implying that such an incident imposed on that legal formulation embodying the cause was not, a fortiori, to attach to that cause existing alone. Then, again, the language of art. 335, \"peuvent cependant \u00eatre annul\u00e9s\" is that of relative nullity, and it introduces a new element, notoriety; why should notoriety be required if its absence gives rise to a broader legal incident and one more beneficial to the incapable? The article cannot be taken as dealing only with a mode of proof. The proof here is of a congenital condition; it would be precisely the same under the article with the additional evidence of notoriety: and in each case actual incapacity would be shown at the moment of the act. If constructive proof only were the object, then an imbecility existing alone in notoriety would seem to be sufficient; but it is uniformly held that a general or habitual incapacity must be shown as well as notoriety.\nThat being so, are the ordinary incidents of relative nullity to attach to insanity alone? There is no inherent necessity that they should: relative nullity restricts the right to raise the question to the private interest intended to be protected, but it coexists with the ordinary incident, in absolute nullity, of restitution limited to unjust enrichment under art. 1011. But art. 335, if it is to be taken as remitting the matters there mentioned to an annulment in justice with all that that implies, requires restitutio in integrum as a condition of relief; and in that view, the same character of nullity and incident would attach to insanity without notoriety. But even if in cases within the article, treating it as an extension of 334, notoriety as serving an equivalent purpose of registration, restitution followed as in interdiction under art. 1011, I should, for the reasons already stated, hold its necessary implication to be that insanity without notoriety is subject to the ordinary requirement of restitution in annulment.\nConstruing these provisions, then, together, and treating art. 986 as the general statement of basic rule, modified by the specific provisions of the other articles, I find them to place the claim to relief on the ground of insanity, without more, under the ordinary procedure of judicial annulment or rescission, and that consequently, as a condition of relief, there must be a return of what was received. As that is not offered here, the action fails.\nThis result is in accord with the weight of opinion of French commentators in their interpretation of the Code Napol\u00e9on, the articles of which, in this respect, are not materially different from those of the Civil Code; and with it, the Commissioners in 1866 were undoubtedly familiar. In the Roman days and in fact down to the latter part of the 18th century, the conceptions of mental disturbance were extremely crude notions of demonism; but by 1803 science had given its first intimations that understanding ranged in a continuous gradation from dementia to the highest intelligence. Extreme derangement demonstrates itself and excludes action in good faith. The cases most frequently met are those of an apparent competency on the strength of which the interests of others are engaged. The exigencies of ordinary business and commercial activities, in conjunction with the deeper knowledge of mind, necessitate a rule more adapted to realities. In the case here, one of two innocent parties must suffer; and one of them has in fact misled the other: in any sense of justice, the latter is in the stronger position. That these matters were appreciated in the framing of the Civil Code is indicated by the articles mentioned and particularly by the fifth paragraph of art. 986 which does not appear in the Code Napol\u00e9on.\nThe appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nFauteux, J.:\u2014A l'initiative de Paul Lussier,\u2014l'un des appelants\u2014, Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi fut, le 1er juin 1944, interdite pour prodigalit\u00e9; Lussier \u00e9tait alors nomm\u00e9 curateur \u00e0 ses biens. Le 13 avril 1945, \u00e9galement sur la requ\u00eate de Lussier, Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi \u00e9tait interdite pour imb\u00e9cillit\u00e9 et le requ\u00e9rant nomm\u00e9 curateur \u00e0 sa personne autant qu'\u00e0 ses biens. Imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s cette derni\u00e8re interdiction, Lussier, \u00e8s qualit\u00e9 de curateur, intenta une s\u00e9rie d'actions\u2014dont la pr\u00e9sente\u2014pour faire annuler les actes consentis par Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 son interdiction.\nLa convention qui fait la base de la pr\u00e9sente cause est un acte d'obligation re\u00e7u devant Me \u00c9mile Beauchemin, notaire, le 24 juillet 1942, aux termes duquel Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi, c\u00e9libataire majeure, alors frapp\u00e9e d'aucune incapacit\u00e9 judiciaire, reconnaissait et d\u00e9clarait devoir aux d\u00e9fenderesses intim\u00e9es la somme de $4,000, pour pr\u00eat d'autant \u00e0 un taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat de 5 p. 100, remboursable dans quatre ans, et \u00e0 la garantie de ce remboursement c\u00e9dait et transportait, jusqu'\u00e0 due concurrence, partie d'une cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire au montant de $29,000 qu'elle d\u00e9tenait contre le mis-en-cause Phoenix.\nComme cause d'annulation de ce contrat, on a invoqu\u00e9 comme motifs en l'action: 1\u00b0 Que mademoiselle Rosconi a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de l\u00e9sion, de fraude ou dol; 2\u00b0 Que les causes ayant donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 son interdiction pour imb\u00e9cillit\u00e9 existaient de fa\u00e7on notoire \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de cet acte d'obligation, soit en 1942, et: 3\u00b0 Qu'\u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, elle souffrait, au moment de l'acte, d'une faiblesse d'esprit l'emp\u00eachant de donner un consentement valable.\nEn substance, les all\u00e9gations de cette demande ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ni\u00e9es par les intim\u00e9es qui, en outre de leur bonne foi, ont plaid\u00e9 que l'action \u00e9tait mal fond\u00e9e en fait et en droit. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a accueilli l'action du curateur, annul\u00e9 l'acte d'obligation ci-dessus et enjoint au mis-en-cause, registrateur de la division de Montr\u00e9al, d'en radier l'enregistrement au livre des Immeubles.\nCe jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi (Juridiction d'appel) 9, laquelle a rejet\u00e9 l'action du curateur, avec d\u00e9pens. Pendant l'instance en appel, Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi d\u00e9c\u00e9dait, ab-intestat, laissant comme h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux, Bernadette Rosconi et Eug\u00e9nie Rosconi, respectivement m\u00e8re et tante de Lussier. Ces h\u00e9riti\u00e8res, la derni\u00e8re repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par son curateur Lussier, reprirent alors l'instance.\nDans leur factum ou \u00e0 l'audition devant nous, les appelants font reposer leur appel sur les trois motifs invoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l'action avec, cependant, une insistance qui, inexistante au d\u00e9but de l'audition, s'est \u00e9ventuellement fix\u00e9e au cours d'icelle sur le troisi\u00e8me point, sans cependant express\u00e9ment abandonner les deux autres.\nAu seuil de l'examen de ces trois points, il est pertinent de rapporter les faits suivants. Mademoiselle Rosconi vivait avec sa m\u00e8re jusqu'au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de cette derni\u00e8re en 1935, alors que, par testament d'icelle, elle est devenue, \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 67 ans, h\u00e9riti\u00e8re d'une fortune assez consid\u00e9rable. Personne \u00e9minemment religieuse et charitable, elle c\u00e9dait volontiers aux appels de souscriptions, aux demandes d'assistance en faveur d'\u0153uvres sociales ou religieuses, ou d'\u0153uvre qui lui \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es comme telles. Que ce penchant, av\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e9ventuellement comme exag\u00e9r\u00e9, ait \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet d'une exploitation croissante imputable particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 deux la\u00efques peu scrupuleux, dont un nomm\u00e9 P\u00e9ladeau; que pour, \u00e0 ces fins, r\u00e9aliser de l'argent, elle ait en plus liquid\u00e9 \u00e0 perte de bonnes et importantes cr\u00e9ances immobili\u00e8res et que, comme r\u00e9sultat du tout, sa fortune en soit devenue, \u00e0 la fin des dix ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant l'action, consid\u00e9rablement amoindrie, la chose est certaine. Il faut pr\u00e9ciser, cependant, que ce penchant de mademoiselle Rosconi, son \u00e9tat mental\u2014quel qu'il fut au moment de l'acte attaqu\u00e9, soit en 1942\u2014aussi bien que l'ampleur des dilapidations subs\u00e9quemment mises \u00e0 jour en 1945 par la preuve dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, tout cela \u00e9tait totalement inconnu des intim\u00e9es. Entre ces derni\u00e8res et toutes autres personnes poursuivies, impliqu\u00e9es ou non dans des transactions possiblement susceptibles de rescission, il y a absence totale de relations. Les intim\u00e9es n'ont m\u00eame jamais vu ni connu mademoiselle Rosconi \u00e0 qui ce pr\u00eat a \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti par l'interm\u00e9diaire du notaire instrumentant. Bref, les intim\u00e9es \u00e9taient d'enti\u00e8re bonne foi; et ce fait a \u00e9t\u00e9 conc\u00e9d\u00e9.\nCes pr\u00e9liminaires pos\u00e9s, il convient d'examiner chacun des motifs des appelants dont le premier couvre: la l\u00e9sion, la fraude ou dol.\nSur la l\u00e9sion: Il suffirait bien de mentionner qu'aux termes de l'article 1012, \"les majeurs ne peuvent \u00eatre restitu\u00e9s contre leurs contrats pour cause de l\u00e9sion seulement\" pour dire que la l\u00e9sion, invoqu\u00e9e comme telle en ce premier moyen doit, vu la majorit\u00e9 de mademoiselle Rosconi, \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e comme facteur pouvant justifier en droit les conclusions de l'action. Subsidiairement et en fait, il peut \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 que, vu objectivement, l'acte attaqu\u00e9 ne sugg\u00e8re aucune l\u00e9sion. Il n'a rien d'anormal dans sa forme et, dans sa substance, il manifeste l'\u00e9quivalence des prestations des parties contractantes. Les obligations et, en particulier, la garantie donn\u00e9e par mademoiselle Rosconi sont limit\u00e9es \u00e0 la somme de $4,000 qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00eat\u00e9e et effectivement vers\u00e9e le m\u00eame jour par les intim\u00e9es.\nSur les all\u00e9gations de fraude ou dol: P\u00e9ladeau, suivant la preuve, a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'instigateur de cet emprunt et il a, de fait, subs\u00e9quemment touch\u00e9 la majeure partie du produit d'icelui. Les man\u0153uvres ou repr\u00e9sentations qu'on lui impute, pour ainsi induire mademoiselle Rosconi \u00e0 emprunter, \u00e0 son avantage, fournissent en fait, suivant les appelants, l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de fraude ou dol en l'affaire. Ainsi limit\u00e9 et consid\u00e9r\u00e9 avec l'admission de bonne foi des intim\u00e9es, il n'y aurait pour disposer de ce point qu'\u00e0 rappeler que suivant les termes de l'article 993: \"La fraude ou le dol est une cause de nullit\u00e9 lorsque les man\u0153uvres pratiqu\u00e9es par l'une des parties ou \u00e0 sa connaissance, sont telles que, sans cela, l'autre partie n'aurait pas contract\u00e9\". Clairement, les intim\u00e9es n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ni partie aux man\u0153uvres de P\u00e9ladeau ni n'en ont eu connaissance. Mais, sugg\u00e8re-t-on pour les appelants, le notaire instrumentant est leur mandataire et agissant dans l'ex\u00e9cution et limites du mandat et en connaissance des man\u0153uvres de P\u00e9ladeau, il engage la responsabilit\u00e9 des intim\u00e9es vis-\u00e0-vis mademoiselle Rosconi. Assumant que le notaire instrumentant puisse, en l'esp\u00e8ce, \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme mandataire des intim\u00e9es, il n'y a, en fait, aucune preuve qu'il ait eu connaissance des man\u0153uvres dolosives que P\u00e9ladeau ait pu faire pour les fins de l'acte attaqu\u00e9. Envisageant m\u00eame toutes les conventions faites par le notaire Beauchemin, celle attaqu\u00e9e\u2014la premi\u00e8re qu'il ait faite\u2014, comme les subs\u00e9quentes, et le reconnaissant comme devenu mandataire attitr\u00e9 de mademoiselle Rosconi, le juge au proc\u00e8s n'a pas conclu que le notaire Beauchemin avait acquis, durant tout ce temps, la connaissance des man\u0153uvres dolosives de P\u00e9ladeau \u00e0 l'endroit de mademoiselle Rosconi. Bien au contraire et sur ce point, il s'exprime comme suit au jugement:\nEn ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, son mandataire attitr\u00e9, le notaire Beauchemin, aurait d\u00fb agir avec plus de sagesse et de circonspection. Les intrigues de P\u00e9ladeau auraient d\u00fb lui ouvrir les yeux.\nC'est la connaissance des man\u0153uvres dolosives et non le d\u00e9faut de sagesse ou de circonspection \u00e0 les d\u00e9celer qui constitue le fait juridique conditionnant l'application de l'article 993 d\u00e9clarant la fraude ou dol comme cause de nullit\u00e9 des contrats.\nEt, au fait, est-il bien \u00e9tabli que le notaire Beauchemin ait, en l'occurrence, agi en qualit\u00e9 de mandataire des intim\u00e9es? Sans doute, il a g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement affirm\u00e9 que ces derni\u00e8res \u00e9taient ses clientes. Mais cette affirmation n'\u00e9puise pas la question. Parlant des caract\u00e9ristiques propres \u00e0 la profession notariale dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, M. le juge Mignault disait:\nThere is another feature I might mention, and that is that in this Province the notary is the adviser of both parties\u2026 (Notaries and Notarial Deeds in the Province of Quebec, Canadian Bar Association, 1929, p. 33.).\nSur la nature m\u00eame du contrat entre le notaire et ses clients, on lit dans Planiol et Ripert, Trait\u00e9 pratique de droit civil fran\u00e7ais, 1932, Vol. II, p. 776, n\u00b0 1433:\nLe notaire, dans l'exercice de ses fonctions propres, qui sont de conseiller les parties, et de monumenter leurs conventions, n'est pas un mandataire. C'est ce que reconna\u00eet la jurisprudence elle-m\u00eame, \u00e0 laquelle on reproche \u00e0 tort de m\u00e9conna\u00eetre ce principe. M\u00eame lorsque c'est le notaire qui a mis en rapports les parties entre lesquelles a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu l'acte re\u00e7u par lui, la Cour de cassation ne lui reconna\u00eet pas pour cela la qualit\u00e9 de mandataire, tant qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 par un client de conclure ou d'accomplir pour lui un acte juridique.\nIl r\u00e9sulte clairement des r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es par le notaire Beauchemin\u2014et, sur le point, c'est la seule preuve au dossier\u2014que ce ne sont pas les intim\u00e9es mais bien P\u00e9ladeau qui, pour le compte de mademoiselle Rosconi, a requis ses services pour les fins de l'acte attaqu\u00e9. Tout au plus peut-on dire que Beauchemin, comptant d\u00e9j\u00e0 les intim\u00e9es dans sa client\u00e8le, y ajoutait, en l'occasion pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, celle de mademoiselle Rosconi et qu'en somme, il n'aurait en l'instance que mis en rapports une nouvelle cliente, lui demandant de conclure un pr\u00eat, avec d'autres clientes, ayant de l'argent \u00e0 pr\u00eater.\nPour les raisons ci-dessus, ce premier point des appelants doit \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9.\nAjoutons, de plus, une autre objection fatale. Personne ne peut s'enrichir aux d\u00e9pens d'autrui est un principe ayant comme corollaire une r\u00e8gle particuli\u00e8re aux actions en annulation de contrats voulant que, par l'annulation, les parties soient remises dans l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient avant. D'o\u00f9 l'obligation de rembourser et, pour cela, offrir avec l'action, le montant re\u00e7u en vertu de la convention attaqu\u00e9e.\nDans le cadre de l'argument soumis comme premier point des appelants, ce principe ne souffre pas d'exception. Les appelants ont fait d\u00e9faut d'y satisfaire, ils doivent donc en subir les cons\u00e9quences. (Latreille v. Gouin) 10.\nEn second lieu, se pr\u00e9valant du fait de l'interdiction pour imb\u00e9cillit\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e moins de deux ans avant l'action, on invoque les dispositions d'un article faisant exception en droit commun, soit l'article 335, lequel se lit comme suit:\nLes actes ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l'interdiction prononc\u00e9e pour imb\u00e9cillit\u00e9, d\u00e9mence ou fureur, peuvent cependant \u00eatre annul\u00e9s si la cause de l'interdiction existait notoirement \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 ces actes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits:\nLa lecture de cet article invite deux questions: d'abord, le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le-t-il la preuve des faits conditionnant le jeu de la disposition et, ensuite, les principes reconnus comme gouvernant l'exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire accord\u00e9 au juge quand la preuve de ces faits est au dossier, ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce? En plus d'\u00e9tablir l'interdiction pour imb\u00e9cillit\u00e9, les appelants devaient prouver que l'imb\u00e9cillit\u00e9\u2014et non la simple faiblesse d'esprit\u2014\u00e9tait l'\u00e9tat habituel et notoire de mademoiselle Rosconi \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de l'acte attaqu\u00e9. En droit, la capacit\u00e9 mentale est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e et, pour cette raison, la loi exige que lorsque cette pr\u00e9somption est \u00e9cart\u00e9e par la reconnaissance judiciaire de l'incapacit\u00e9, ce fait juridique soit, par des publications prescrites, port\u00e9 \u00e0 la connaissance des tiers pour leur protection. Dans les conditions de l'article 335, cependant, c'est la notori\u00e9t\u00e9 du fait de l'incapacit\u00e9 qui tient lieu de cette publicit\u00e9. La notori\u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sente donc une condition tr\u00e8s importante au jeu \u00e9quitable de cet article qui, non seulement d\u00e9truit la pr\u00e9somption de capacit\u00e9, mais en fait na\u00eetre une nouvelle\u2014celle-ci juris et de jure\u2014voulant que l'\u00e9tat d'incapacit\u00e9 mentale soit tenu comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 connu de tous. L'ignorance de ce fait notoire ne peut pas \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e. Adoptant, sans qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire de les reproduire ici, les raisons et conclusions des juges de la Cour d'Appel 11 sur l'absence de preuve de notori\u00e9t\u00e9, il me faut \u00e9carter ce second moyen des appelants.\nPrenant m\u00eame pour bien fond\u00e9e la conclusion oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 laquelle le juge de premi\u00e8re instance en est venu sur ce fait, et lui reconnaissant ainsi la facult\u00e9 de maintenir ou renvoyer l'action, a-t-il appliqu\u00e9 les principes propres \u00e0 l'exercice de cette discr\u00e9tion, principes pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s comme suit dans Planiol et Ripert, Tome 1, \u00e0 la page 726:\nSi les deux conditions qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent sont r\u00e9unies, l'acte peut \u00eatre annul\u00e9, mais, contrairement \u00e0 l'acte post\u00e9rieur \u00e0 l'interdiction, il ne l'est pas obligatoirement. Le tribunal a sur ce point un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire qu'il exercera en tenant compte \u00e0 la fois de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du d\u00e9ment, de la bonne foi des tiers menac\u00e9s par la nullit\u00e9, enfin, de l'existence possible d'un intervalle lucide au moment o\u00f9 l'acte attaqu\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9.\nAu jugement, l'unique r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 cette question est dans le consid\u00e9rant suivant:\nConsid\u00e9rant que m\u00eame si la preuve de ces deux faits existe, la loi n'impose n\u00e9cessairement point aux juges l'obligation de prononcer la r\u00e9siliation de l'acte incrimin\u00e9, mais leur conf\u00e8re tout au plus la facult\u00e9 ou le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d'adjuger suivant les circonstances qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la transaction, en tenant compte de la bonne ou mauvaise foi des tiers. Vainement, cependant, cherche-t-on ailleurs dans le juge ment de premi\u00e8re instance, qu'une application ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite de cet \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de droit en fonction des facteurs qu'il fallait consid\u00e9rer. Particuli\u00e8rement, et sur la question de la bonne foi des intim\u00e9es menac\u00e9es par la nullit\u00e9, rien n'est dit. Sur l'exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire accord\u00e9 au juge, on peut, rappeler ici certains passages de ce qu'en dit Lord Halsbury dans Sharp v. Wakefield 12, particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 la page 179:\nAn extensive power is confided to the justices in their capacity as justices to be exercised judicially; and \"discretion\" means when it is said that something is to be done within the discretion of the authorities that that something is to be done according to the rules of reason and justice, not according to private opinion: Rooke's Case;................ It is to be, not arbitrary, vague, and fanciful, but legal and regular.\nBien qu'il soit tr\u00e8s douteux que ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire accord\u00e9 par l'article 335 ait \u00e9t\u00e9, en l'esp\u00e8ce, judiciairement exerc\u00e9, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de pousser davantage l'examen de cette question.\nEn dernier lieu, les appelants ont soumis, et c'est le point sur lequel on a insist\u00e9, que l'acte de juillet 1942 devait \u00eatre invalid\u00e9 parce que Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi \u00e9tait, au moment de cet acte, ali\u00e9n\u00e9e ou faible d'esprit, et, pour l'une ou l'autre de ces raisons, incapable de donner un consentement valable.\nJos\u00e9phine Rosconi \u00e9tait-elle, en 1942, ali\u00e9n\u00e9e ou simplement faible d'esprit? La distinction est utile \u00e0 la discussion de ce troisi\u00e8me point m\u00eame si elle est, pour les raisons ci-apr\u00e8s mentionn\u00e9es, non strictement n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision. Au Tome 1, Planiol et Ripert, Trait\u00e9 pratique de droit civil fran\u00e7ais, page 688, n\u00b0 661, nous lisons:\nL'interdiction n\u00e9cessite une alt\u00e9ration tr\u00e8s grave des facult\u00e9s intellectuelles. Ceci r\u00e9sulte implicitement de l'art. 499, qui permet au juge de se contenter de donner un conseil judiciaire au d\u00e9fendeur, s'il ne constate que de la faiblesse d'esprit.\nIl y a tous les degr\u00e9s entre l'homme sain et le faible d'esprit, et entre le faible d'esprit et l'ali\u00e9n\u00e9. Pour savoir si le degr\u00e9 d'ali\u00e9nation mentale est tel qu'il doive entra\u00eener l'interdiction, les juges se demandent s'il met l'ali\u00e9n\u00e9 hors d'\u00e9tat de conduire sa personne et de g\u00e9rer son patrimoine.\nSous notre Code, les articles 331, 334 et 349 et suivants, sanctionnent cette m\u00eame distinction. Il ne suffit donc pas qu'une personne soit incapable de g\u00e9rer son patrimoine pour qu'elle soit reconnue comme ali\u00e9n\u00e9e. Il faut qu'elle soit \"hors d'\u00e9tat de conduire sa personne\". La distinction para\u00eet avoir \u00e9chapp\u00e9 au juge de premi\u00e8re instance. Plusieurs passages du jugement le sugg\u00e8rent. Et, quant \u00e0 la Cour d'Appel, la majorit\u00e9 laisse entendre que la preuve ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas que Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi \u00e9tait ali\u00e9n\u00e9e.\nSans doute, les juges si\u00e9geant en revision ne doivent pas, en principe, en pareille mati\u00e8re, \" changer les conclusions de fait auxquelles le juge de premi\u00e8re instance en est arriv\u00e9 dans l'examen de la preuve. Encore faut-il que la preuve existe. Or, rien au dossier, soit une opinion ou un fait rapport\u00e9, nous permet de dire que Jos\u00e9phine Rosconi \u00e9tait, en 1942, \"hors d'\u00e9tat de conduire sa personne\". Exclusivement en relation avec la g\u00e9rance de son patrimoine, la preuve, susceptible d'affecter la pr\u00e9somption de capacit\u00e9 mentale, ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le chez cette femme, \u00e2g\u00e9e et fortun\u00e9e, que ceci: une prodigalit\u00e9 inspir\u00e9e de charit\u00e9, une croyance aveugle dans la bonne foi des autres, de la na\u00efvet\u00e9 dans l'examen des repr\u00e9sentations qu'on lui faisait, de l'insouciance ou un d\u00e9faut d'appr\u00e9ciation des pertes r\u00e9sultant des liquidations de ses valeurs immobili\u00e8res. Bref, une r\u00e9ponse tomb\u00e9e de la bouche m\u00eame du docteur Legrand peut possiblement r\u00e9sumer son \u00e9tat: \"Oui, ce sont des gens que l'on ne d\u00e9signe pas sous le nom de folles, mais sous le nom de pas fins\".\nQue mademoiselle Rosconi ait \u00e9t\u00e9, en 1942, soit ali\u00e9n\u00e9e ou simplement faible d'esprit, le d\u00e9faut d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9 du demandeur \u00e8s qualit\u00e9 d'offrir avec son action, pour \u00eatre rembours\u00e9e aux intim\u00e9es, la somme de $4,000 effectivement par elles vers\u00e9e \u00e0 mademoiselle Rosconi, emp\u00eache les appelants d'obtenir le jugement qu'ils recherchent. Mais, disent-ils, l'article 1011 fait exception \u00e0 cette obligation de remboursement. Cet article \u00e9dicte:\nLorsque les mineurs, les interdits ou les femmes mari\u00e9es, sont admis, en ces qualit\u00e9s, \u00e0 se faire restituer contre leurs contrats, le remboursement de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9, en cons\u00e9quence de ces engagements, pay\u00e9 pendant la minorit\u00e9, l'interdiction ou le mariage, n'en peut \u00eatre exig\u00e9 \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit prouv\u00e9 que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi pay\u00e9 a tourn\u00e9 \u00e0 leur profit.\nL'exception n'est donc \u00e9tablie qu'en faveur du mineur, de la femme mari\u00e9e et de l'interdit, et ne couvre, au surplus, que le remboursement de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 pendant la minorit\u00e9, le mariage ou l'interdiction. Or, mademosielle Rosconi \u00e9tant, au moment de l'acte d'obligation, majeure, c\u00e9libataire, et non interdite, on ne saurait lui donner le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la disposition sans d'abord y ajouter, et faire \u0153uvre de l\u00e9gislation et sans, ensuite, \u00e9tendre cette exception faite au jeu du principe voulant que personne ne puisse s'enrichir aux d\u00e9pens d'autrui. L'article 1011 reproduit substantiellement le texte de l'article 1312 du Code Napol\u00e9on, tel que ce dernier existait lors de notre codification. Et comme l'article 1124 du Code Napol\u00e9on\u2014tel qu'alors existant\u2014, notre article 986, indiquant les personnes inhabiles \u00e0 contracter, mentionne d'autres cas que celui des mineurs, des femmes mari\u00e9es et des interdits. Mais, ni sous le Code Napol\u00e9on, ni sous le n\u00f4tre, a-t-on jamais \u00e9tendu \u00e0 ces autres cas l'exception au principe sanctionn\u00e9e par notre article 1011 et par l'article 1312 du Code Napol\u00e9on. Dans la permanence de la similitude des deux lois \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, on peut reconna\u00eetre la volont\u00e9 du l\u00e9gislateur de ne pas ajouter d'autres cas \u00e0 l'exception.\nLa pr\u00e9somption g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de capacit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale domine toute la question. D'une part, et dans le cas du mineur, de la femme mari\u00e9e et de l'interdit, c'est la loi qui, d\u00e9j\u00e0, a \u00e9cart\u00e9 cette pr\u00e9somption d'une fa\u00e7on relative ou absolue. D'autre part, et dans le cas du faible d'esprit ou de l'ali\u00e9n\u00e9, cette pr\u00e9somption demeure jusqu'au jour o\u00f9 les tribunaux interviennent, soit pour prononcer l'interdiction ou pourvoir \u00e0 la nomination d'un conseil judiciaire, ou soit pour annuler, faute d'un consentement valable d\u00fb \u00e0 une insanit\u00e9 mentale la convention attaqu\u00e9e. Dans le premier cas, c'est le fait du l\u00e9gislateur pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant l'acte attaqu\u00e9; dans le second, c'est le fait du tribunal, post\u00e9rieur \u00e0 l'acte attaqu\u00e9. Cette distinction se traduit n\u00e9cessairement dans la diff\u00e9rence du traitement des deux cas, lequel, inspir\u00e9 et mesur\u00e9, d'une part, par le degr\u00e9 de protection requis par l'incapable et, d'autre part, par le degr\u00e9 de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qu'il convient de donner aux contrats faits par les tiers de bonne foi, varie, suivant que la pr\u00e9somption de capacit\u00e9 \u00e9tait \u00e9cart\u00e9e ou non au moment de la passation du contrat attaqu\u00e9. La jeunesse du mineur, la personne de la femme mari\u00e9e, les publications officielles suivant le prononc\u00e9 de l'interdiction, sont pour les tiers des avertissements que la pr\u00e9somption de capacit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale est menac\u00e9e ou compl\u00e8tement \u00e9cart\u00e9e. Mais le germe d'invalidit\u00e9, n\u00e9 de l'ali\u00e9nation ou de la fai- blesse d'esprit non judiciairement reconnue et, de fait, non toujours apparente, ne peut \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 un m\u00eame avertissement \u00e0 l'endroit des tiers prudents et de bonne foi. Et on peut voir l\u00e0 la raison de ne pas obliger ces derniers \u00e0 souffrir dans ces cas, outre l'annulation de leurs contrats, la perte du remboursement des sommes qu'ils ont pay\u00e9es, en cons\u00e9quence.\nDe plus, et consid\u00e9rant mademoiselle Rosconi comme faible d'esprit en 1942, sa position, devant la loi, ne saurait \u00eatre plus avantageuse que si elle eut \u00e9t\u00e9 alors, non seulement faible d'esprit, mais judiciairement reconnue comme telle par les tribunaux et pourvue d'un conseil judiciaire. Or, il est clair des termes de l'article 334 qui, en cela, diff\u00e8re fondamentalement de l'article 502 du Code Napol\u00e9on, d'o\u00f9 il est tir\u00e9, que sa position n'est pas, sous notre droit, identique \u00e0 celle faite \u00e0 l'interdit par notre article. Alors que l'article 502 du Code Napol\u00e9on prescrit que \"L'interdiction ou la nomination d'un conseil a son effet du jour du jugement et que tous actes pass\u00e9s post\u00e9rieurement par l'interdit, ou sans l'assistance du conseil, seront nuls de droit\", notre article 334 r\u00e9p\u00e8te bien que \"tout acte fait post\u00e9rieurement par l'interdit pour cause d'imb\u00e9cillit\u00e9, d\u00e9mence ou fureur, est nul\"; mais diff\u00e8re en disant \"que les actes faits par celui auquel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 un conseil sans en \u00eatre assist\u00e9, sont nuls s'ils lui sont pr\u00e9judiciables, de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que ceux du mineur et de l'interdit pour prodigalit\u00e9, d'apr\u00e8s 987\".\nCe qui veut dire, suivant Sirois, Tutelles et Curatelles, page 497:\nqu'il faut prouver la l\u00e9sion pour faire d\u00e9clarer cet acte nul et qu'il ne suff\u00eet pas simplement d'\u00e9tablir que l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait depuis la nomination du conseil judiciaire pour le faire annuler.\nCette diff\u00e9rence fondamentale en notre droit, entre le cas de l'interdit et celui du faible d'esprit pourvu d'un conseil judiciaire, peut sugg\u00e9rer un autre motif pour ne pas \u00e9tendre l'exception de l'article 1011 au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des appelants.\nPour toutes ces raisons, je rejetterais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les Cours.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the Appellants: Duranleau, Dupr\u00e9 & Duranleau.\nSolicitor for the Respondents: C.

Manning K.C. for the appellant.\nM.J. Grant K.C. and J.W. Cram for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice, Taschereau and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by:\nKERWIN J.:\u2014This is an action for alleged infringement of copyright. The plaintiff appellant is the owner of the performing right in Canada of the musical works \u201cBegin the Beguine\u201d and \u201cTea for Two\u201d. That right falls within s. 3(1) of the Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 32:\u2014 For the purposes of this Act, \u201ccopyright\u201d means the sole right * * * to perform * * * the work or any substantial part thereof in public; * * * and to authorize any such acts as aforesaid.\nBy s. 17 of the Act as amended by s. 2 of c. 27 of the 1938 statutes:\n17. Copyright in a work shall be deemed to be infringed by any person who, without the consent of the owner of the copyright, does anything the sole right to do which is by this Act conferred on the owner of the copyright:\nProvided that the following acts shall not constitute an infringement of copyright:\u2014\n* * *\n(vii). The performance without motive of gain of any musical work at any agricultural, agricultural-industrial exhibition or fair which received a grant from or is held under Dominion, provincial or municipal authority, by the directors thereof.\nSubsection 1 of s. 20 enacts:\nWhere copyright in any work has been infringed, the owner of the copyright shall, except as otherwise provided by this Act, be entitled to all such remedies by way of injunction, damages, accounts, and otherwise, as are or may be conferred by law for the infringement of a right.\nPursuant to its Act of incorporation, the respondent defendant corporation conducted, on lands in the City of London and in buildings erected thereon, an exhibition known as the \u201cWestern Fair\u201d. The action went to trial on an agreed statement of facts, from which it appears that the respondent alleges, and the appellant denies, that the \u201cWestern Fair\u201d so conducted was an agricultural, agricultural-industrial exhibition or fair within the meaning of s. 17(1) (vii) set out above. The trial judge decided that the Western Fair as conducted in 1948 was an agricultural-industrial exhibition or fair within the meaning of this enactment, and the Court of Appeal affirmed that finding. Counsel for the appellant did not challenge that finding before this Court.\nIt was in the year 1948 that the alleged infringement occurred when special entertainment for those attending the fair was provided in two shows daily (afternoon and evening) before a grand-stand in a special enclosure to which admission fees were charged. This entertainment consisted of horse races and exhibition and judging of harness horses during the afternoon performances only; and for both performances, vaudeville and acrobatic acts, during the course of one of which a musical troop played \u201cBegin the Beguine\u201d. These vaudeville and acrobatic acts were produced and directed by an American booking agency under a contract with the respondent. Band music was continuously played during the course of the vaudeville and acrobatic acts; such band music being provided by the London Technical Band under a contract with the respondent. During the course of each performance before the grand-stand such band played \u201cBegin the Beguine\u201d. The respondent engaged, under contract, The White Rose Petrolia Concert Band to play music for the general entertainment of the public from a band-stand located upon the fair grounds and on one of the evenings during the exhibition such band performed \u201cTea for Two\u201d.\nThe first sentence in paragraph 15 of the agreed statement of facts makes it clear that these performances were authorized by the respondent. The second sentence in that paragraph is relied upon by the respondent as indicating that the parties agreed that within the meaning of s. 17(1) (vii) the performances were \u201cwithout motive of gain\u201d. Paragraph 15 reads as follows:\n15. The Defendant employed the said performers and bands mentioned in the preceding paragraphs 12, 13 and 14 foregoing for the purposes of performing the musical works therein mentioned and authorized and instructed them to perform the same as stated therein. The motive of the Directors of the Defendant in causing the Defendant to employ the said performers and bands and in having them play the said musical works was to provide entertainment for and to please those attending The Western Fair and to make the Western Fair one which would be largely attended by the public.\nIt is impossible to read the last part of this paragraph as disposing of the main contention between the parties.\nThe proper construction of s. 17(1) (vii) requires that attention first be directed to the concluding words \u201cby the directors thereof\u201d. In this connection the enactment (1938, c. 27, s. 2) appears in the French version as follows:\n(vii) L\u2019ex\u00e9cution, sans intention de gain, d\u2019une \u0153uvre musicale \u00e0 une exposition agricole, ou \u00e0 une exposition industrielle et agricole, ou \u00e0 une foire, qui re\u00e7oit une subvention d\u2019une autorit\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, provinciale ou municipale, ou qui est tenue par ses administrateurs en vertu d\u2019une telle autorit\u00e9.\nIt is clear, as was held by this Court in The King v. Dubois[3], that a statute in the English version must be read with the statute in the French version. So read, the former means that the words \u201cby the directors thereof\u201d refer to an exhibition or fair which is held under Dominion, provincial or municipal authority.\nBefore proceeding further to construe s. 17(1) (vii), it should be noticed that the first reference to an exhibition or fair appeared by an amendment to the Copyright Act in c. 8 of the Statutes of 1931. Prior thereto the provisos as to certain acts not constituting an infringement of copyright were contained in paragraphs (i) to (vi). In that year numbers (vii) and (viii) were added in the following terms:\n(vii) The performance of any musical work by any church, college or school, or by any religious, charitable or fraternal organization, provided such performance is given without private profit for religious, educational or charitable purposes. (viii) The performance without private profit of any musical work at any agricultural exhibition or fair which is held under Dominion, Provincial or Municipal authority.\nIn this state of the law, Chief Justice Rose decided in Canadian Performing Rights Society Ltd. v. Canadian National Exhibition Association[4], that the exhibition or fair of the defendant could not be described as an \u201cagricultural exhibition or fair\u201d but would probably be an \u201cagricultural-industrial exhibition\u201d. He held also that, even if it were the former, the performance was not one without private profit to the band that performed a certain musical work, and that, even if the words \u201cthe performance without private profit\u201d meant without such profit to the holders of the exhibition or fair, the defendant acted for its private profit even if there were no net profits from the performances in the grand-stand enclosure during the year in which the infringement occurred.\nBy c. 28 of the 1936 statutes, the provisions above set out were repealed and the following substituted therefor:\n(vii) The performance of any musical work by any church, college or school, or by any religious, charitable or fraternal organization, provided such performance is given without private profit for religious, educational or charitable purposes; provided, further, that such performance shall be deemed to be given without private profit if the only fees which are paid are paid to individual performers and that no fees or commissions are paid to any promoter, producer or contractor for services in promoting or producing the performance.\n(viii) The performance without private profit of any musical work at any agricultural, agricultural-industrial exhibition, or fair, which receives a grant from or is held under dominion, provincial or municipal authority, provided that such performance shall be deemed to be given without private profit if the only fees which are paid, are paid to the individual performers or their agents, and provided, further, that such fees are not dependent upon the attendance at the exhibition or fair.\nUnder this wording, Green J. decided in Canadian Performing Rights Society Ltd. v. Canadian National Exhibition Association[5], that although certain performances complained of were given at the agricultural-industrial exhibition held by the defendant, yet they were not without private profit since fees were paid in connection with the entertainment at which the musical works were performed to persons (such as ticket sellers) other than the individual performers or their agents.\nThen came the 1938 amendment with which we are concerned and under which J.G. Kelly J. in Canadian Performing Rights Society Ltd. v. Lombardo[6], held that the motive of the Canadian National Exhibition Association in holding the exhibition at which the defendant performed certain musical works was to please the guests and not to make pecuniary gain although gain might result. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from this decision on the ground that in order to secure the benefit of exception (vii) as enacted in 1938, it was essential that the defendant should shelter himself under the aegis of the directors of the association because, in the view of the Court of Appeal, it was a performance by the directors immediate or mediate that conferred immunity under the statute. It was held that an onus rested upon the defendant of establishing that the directors exercised control over the performances complained of, which he had failed to satisfy.\nFlowing logically from this decision, Mr. Justice LeBel in the present case, and the Court of Appeal, held that the performances in question were by the directors. It was also held that the performances were without motive of gain on their part. With respect I am unable to agree. For reasons already given, the words \u201cby the directors thereof\u201d do not qualify \u201cperformance\u201d or \u201cperformance without motive of gain\u201d. \u201cMotive of gain\u201d is a much wider expression than that used in 1931 \u201cwithout private profit\u201d and it cannot be restricted to circumstances where the motive of gain is the main or the only motive. Even considering the word \u201cgain\u201d as indicating financial advantage, the agreed statement of facts makes it clear that the respondent intended, or had as one object, that financial profit should accrue. Furthermore, as to the proviso in its present form, I agree with Chief Justice Rose when he stated that the proviso considered by him must be construed in the same way whether the action for infringement is taken against the actual performer or against one who has authorized the act.\nCommencing with the basic proposition that the appellant is entitled to copyright in the musical works mentioned unless the respondent is able, on a fair reading of the exceptions in s. 17, to bring itself within one of them, and bearing in mind the history of the enactment, and particularly the fact that in 1936 special provision was made with respect to fees paid to the individual performers or their agents, I conclude that the respondent has not succeeded in bringing itself within exception (vii) and that the appeal should be allowed. The appellant is entitled to a declaration that the respondent has infringed the appellant\u2019s copyright in the musical works referred to by the performances thereof in public without the consent of the appellant, and that it is entitled to damages and its costs of the action and of the appeals. As this is a test action, the damages should be fixed at the nominal sum of $5. The costs in the Courts below should be taxed on the scale of the Supreme Court of Ontario.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice, Rand, Kellock, Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\nKELLOCK J.\u2014This appeal involves the interpretation of s. 17 subsection 1 (vii) of the Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 32, as amended. In considering this paragraph it is helpful to refer to the history of the legislation:\nIn 1931, by 21-22 Geo. V, c. 8, s. 6, the following clauses were added to s. 17:\n(vii) The performance of any musical work by any church, college or school, or by any religious, charitable or fraternal organization; provided such performance is given without private profit for religious, educational or charitable purposes.\n(viii) The performance without private profit of any musical work at any agricultural exhibition or fair which is held under Dominion. Provincial or Municipal authority. Following this enactment, the case Canadian Performing Right Society Limited v. Canadian National Exhibition Association[7], came before the late Chief Justice of the High Court. There, the plaintiff complained of the playing of a composition in which it held the copyright, by a paid band at a performance in front of the grandstand at the defendant exhibition. For entrance to the grandstand the defendants made an admission charge in addition to the charge for entry to the exhibition grounds. The entertainment before the grandstand cost the defendants something more than the money taken in at the entrance to the stand. The entertainment itself was furnished because it was supposed to serve as a drawing-card to bring to the exhibition many persons who would not otherwise come. The learned trial judge, Rose C.J.H.C., held that the defendant was not an \u201cagricultural exhibition or fair\u201d within the meaning of the statute and further, that the performance was not \u201cwithout private profit\u201d as, from the standpoint of the performers, they were paid, and from the standpoint of the defendant itself, it desired to make the performance as nearly as possible self-supporting, and directly profitable if possible. In his view, the fact that there were no actual profits, was immaterial.\nIn 1936, by 1 Ed. VIII, c. 28, s. 6 of the Act of 1931 was repealed and the following paragraphs substituted for the former paragraphs (vii) and (viii):\n(vii) The performance of any musical work by any church, college or school, or by any religious, charitable or fraternal organization, provided such performance is given without private profit for religious, educational or charitable purposes; provided, further, that such performance shall be deemed to be given without private profit if the only fees which are paid are paid to individual performers, and that no fees or commissions are paid to any promoter, producer or contractor for services in promoting or producing the performance.\n(viii) The performance without private profit of any musical work at any agricultural, agricultural-industrial exhibition or fair, which receives a grant from or is held under dominion, provincial or municipal authority, provided that such performance shall be deemed to be given without private profit if the only fees which are paid, are paid to the individual performers or their agents, and provided, further, that such fees are not dependent upon the attendance at the exhibition or fair.\nI think it is reasonable to conclude that these amendments were made as a result of the decision of 1934. Paragraph (viii) was extended to include agricultural-industrial exhibitions or fairs, evidently to take in such an exhibition as that of the defendant in the 1934 litigation, and the restriction enacted with respect to the meaning of \u201cwithout private profit\u201d in both paragraphs was apparently intended to render inapplicable the view expressed by Rose C.J.H.C. as to the earlier statute.\nFollowing this legislation, the case, Canadian Performing Right Society Limited v. Canadian National Exhibition Association[8], came before the late Mr. Justice Greene. The alleged infringement of copyright in that case consisted again in the performance of copyright music by a paid band as part of the grandstand performance under the same circumstances as the performance in question in the action before Rose C.J.H.C.\nGreene J. held that the addition of the word \u201cagricultural-industrial\u201d in paragraph (viii) rendered the former judgment inapplicable to the defendant, and brought it within the protection of the paragraph subject to the question as to the meaning of the words \u201cwithout private profit.\u201d As to this the learned judge held that there was private profit by reason of the fact that there were\nfees paid to various people in connection with the entertainment in front of the grandstand, such as ticket sellers, ticket takers, ushers, and probably, various other attendants.\nThis decision was not appealed, but shortly after the delivery of the judgment, Parliament, by 2 Geo. VI, c. 27, s. 2 subsection 2, repealed the former paragraphs (vii) and (viii) and enacted other provisions. For paragraph (viii) was substituted the present paragraph (vii). For the former paragraph (vii), s. 5 of the statute substituted a proviso at the end of subsection 1 of s. 17, as follows:\nFurther provided that no church, college or school, and no religious, charitable or fraternal organization shall be liable to pay any compensation to the owner of any musical work or to any person claiming through him by reason of the public performance of any musical work in furtherance of a religious, educational or charitable object.\nIt will be seen that the change in this paragraph followed a somewhat different course from that adopted with respect to the paragraph here directly in question.\nFollowing upon this amendment, the case, Canadian Performing Right Society Limited v. Lombardo[9], was decided. The defendant was an orchestra leader employed by the Canadian National Exhibition Association to play music for dancing at a dance pavilion on the grounds of the association in connection with its annual exhibition for the year 1938. A fee for entry to the pavilion was charged in addition to the entrance fee for admission to the grounds. The association paid a flat fee to the defendant for the services of himself and his orchestra, and it was in connection with certain musical numbers played by the defendant that the action was brought.\nIt was argued for the plaintiff that the \u201cmotive of gain\u201d referred to in the paragraph was the motive of the actual performers and that, as the defendant, who was a professional musician, was paid for the performance, he was clearly within the section. The learned trial judge rejected this contention and construed the paragraph as though it read\nThe performance of any musical work at any exhibition or fair (of the sort described) where such performance is authorized by the directors of such exhibition, and where the directors in authorizing the performance, have not been induced by any motive of pecuniary gain to such exhibition or fair.\nThe learned judge further held that the word \u201cgain\u201d in the paragraph meant pecuniary gain. Under the legislation under which the association was brought into existence, it could not make profits in the ordinary sense, as it was required to hand over to the City of Toronto all surplus of receipts over disbursements except for the sum of $15,000.\nEvidence was given to the effect that the directors never considered the question of pecuniary profit with regard to any individual attraction held during the exhibition; that no books of account were kept which would show whether there was a profit made on the defendant\u2019s engagement; and that the price charged for entry to the dance pavilion was nominal and was fixed with the object of controlling the attendance rather than with a view to profit.\nThe learned trial judge held that the motive of the directors was to please their guests and not to make pecuniary gain, although gain might result.\nAn appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed. Masten J.A., who gave the leading judgment, construed the legislation as though the words \u201cby the directors\u201d modified the word \u201cperformance.\u201d He held that it was for the defendant, in connection with what he had done, to establish that the directors had exercised control over the performance of the musical numbers in question, and that he failed so to do.\nThis decision throughout is predicated on the express view that the \u201cperformance\u201d with which the paragraph deals is a \u201cperformance by the directors\u201d of the exhibition or fair. However, when one consults the corresponding text in French of the paragraph under consideration (The King v. Dubois[10] at 402-3; Commissioner of Patents v. Winthrop[11] at 54) it is plain that the interpretation placed upon the section in the case cannot stand. The French text reads as follows:\n(vii) L\u2019ex\u00e9cution sans intention de gain, d\u2019une \u0153uvre musicale \u00e0 une exposition agricole, ou \u00e0 une exposition industrielle et agricole, ou \u00e0 une foire, qui re\u00e7oit une subvention d\u2019une autorit\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, provinciale ou municipale, ou qui est tenue par ses administrateurs en vertu d\u2019une telle autorit\u00e9.\nAccordingly, it would appear that the section is to be read as follows:\nThe performance without motive of gain of any musical work at any exhibition or fair.\nof the types described in the paragraph. In my opinion, if this be so, the effect is to render applicable the decision of Rose C.J.H.C. in 1934, although the words which the learned Chief Justice had to construe in that case were \u201cwithout private profit\u201d instead of the words \u201cwithout motive of gain.\u201d I think the following passage from his judgment in 1934 O.R. at p. 621, paraphrased as follows, is applicable and I would so apply it.\nWhether it was or was not a performance without motive of gain on the part of the defendants, it was not a performance without motive of gain to the band concerned, whether the performance was before the grandstand to which a separate entry fee was charged or whether it was in the bandstand within the exhibition grounds outside the grandstand; and I cannot find any justification for reading the paragraph as meaning that so long as the performance is without motive of gain to the persons holding the exhibition, it is protected even if the actual performer is deriving private profit. The objection to such a construction is perhaps more clearly evident when the action is brought against the person who was paid for his performance than when it is brought against the persons who held the exhibition. It seems to me to be equally clear that in order to make the subsection protect the person who performs the work for his own private profit, that is, with a motive of gain, words must be interpolated and the paragraph must be read as a proviso excluding from the general law as established by the Act the performance (to which the Act but for the proviso would extend) of a musical work at an exhibition or fair (of the kind described in the proviso) so long as such performance is without motive of gain to the persons holding the exhibition or fair. I think that the subsection could not in an action brought against the paid performer be read in the way suggested; and if I am right as to that, I do not see how it is possible so to read it in an action brought against other persons. The reading of the section, I think, must be the same no matter who may be the defendant in the action in which the benefit of the proviso is invoked.\nIn the courts below in the case at bar, the judgments are founded on the view as to construction of the legislation taken in Lombardo\u2019s case, and the judgment in appeal, therefore, cannot stand. It should be mentioned that any question as to the exhibition or fair of the defendant not being one within the class described was abandoned before us by counsel for the appellant.\nWhile it is evident that Parliament has intended to give some measure of freedom from liability to pay royalties in connection with the use of copyright material at these exhibitions, it is equally plain, from the presence in paragraph (vii) of qualifying language, that complete immunity was not intended. The difficulty arises from the failure on the part of Parliament to define without ambiguity the measure of immunity intended in paragraph (vii).\nAs the matters mentioned above are sufficient to dispose of this appeal, it is unnecessary to pass upon Mr. Manning\u2019s argument, founded on Performing Right Society v. Bradford Corporation[12], Performing Right Society v. Bray Urban Council[13], and Sarpy v. Holland[14], namely that it being admitted that one of the motives of the directors in causing the works in question to be played was to make the Western Fair one which would be largely attended, and that admission fees were charged for entrance to the fair grounds and to the grandstand, these facts were sufficient of themselves to destroy the conditional immunity created by s. 17(1) (vii).\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs throughout.

The trial judge found the Dagmar Salen two-thirds to blame and the Chinook one-third on the grounds that the Dagmar Salen disregarded the general practice of vessels on this seaway to pass port to port and that both were proceeding at too great speed.\nHeld (Estey and Locke JJ. dissenting) and reversing the percentage findings of the trial judge, that the Chinook should be charged with two-thirds of the responsibility and the Dagmar Salen with one-third.\nBoth ships were going at excessive speed under the circumstances and there was no rule nor invariable custom requiring vessels to pass port to port, but the main fault rested with the Chinook for changing her course just prior to the collision. If the Chinook had maintained her original course or if, at that point, the engines had been reversed, the accident would have been avoided; and if the radar screen on the Chinook had been closely and accurately observed, the course of the other ship would have been made clear and the risk eliminated. That blind action at the critical moment was primarily responsible for the collision.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, British Columbia Admiralty District 1 holding that the Dagmar Salen was more at fault than the Chinook when the two ships collided in the fog in Puget Sound, U.S.A.\nR. C. Holden K.C. and J. I. Bird for the appellant.\nF. A. Sheppard K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau, Rand, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014The facts of the collision in controversy in this appeal can be stated shortly. The Chinook is a motor ship 273.5 feet in length and of 4,106 gross tons, engaged in a daily service between Victoria and Seattle. The Dagmar is likewise a motor ship 405 feet long and 5,000 tons gross. The former was passing through Admiralty Inlet and approaching Puget Sound on the way to Seattle and the latter, well laden, was proceeding north from Seattle bound for Vancouver. The critical time runs from 8.00 o'clock in the evening of September 28, 1947. At that moment, Dagmar was abeam Double Bluff Point and about one-half mile off the Horn buoy; equipped with four six-cylinder diesel engines of 1,100 H.P. each and a radar detector screen, she was making about 12\u00bd knots through the water with an ebb tide that may have brought the speed to approximately 14 knots over land. She was then running on a course 328 degrees true. Three minutes later, the radar screen indicated a vessel 1\u00bd to 5 miles distant about one-half a mile northerly beyond Bush Point and approaching that point one-half a mile off. At 8.05, the pilot, concluding the craft to be on a generally southeasterly course along Whidby Island and too close to that land to allow Dagmar to pass on the port side, changed his course by five degrees to 323 degrees true for a starboard passing. At 8.07, the vessel entered thick fog and the engines were reduced to half speed; at 8.08, a further alteration of course of 10 degrees to 313 degrees was made; at the same time, the whistle of a vessel was heard from the direction of that indicated on the radar screen and the engines were stopped. At 8.11, an alteration of course to starboard by the unknown ship was detected on the screen and full speed astern was ordered; at 8.13\u00bd, the red and masthead lights of Chinook were seen about 10 degrees on the starboard bow, the vessel passing from right to left; visibility was about 600 feet. Both vessels blew three blast signals indicating engines at full speed astern. The starboard bow of Dagmar at 8.14 came into contact with the forward port side of Chinook just aft of the bridge. Neither vessel had more than bare way on it and the collision was not severe. After Dagmar pulled back, each continued on its course.\nThe Chinook, likewise equipped with radar, had been running through heavy fog for over an hour at 18 knots, and assuming it to be against the ebb tide, was making, say, 16 knots over the land. It claimed to have passed abeam of Bush Point at a distance of 1\u00bd miles and that at that time, 8.04, Dagmar appeared on the screen 5 miles distant and at about 30 degrees on the port bow. As this would have placed Dagmar to the east of Double Bluff Point, it was obviously wrong and was admitted to be so by the captain. This time of 8.04 is only a difference of about one minute from that of the appearance of Chinook to Dagmar and it can be taken that they came into view of each other at approximately the same time. Chinook claims at 8.06 to have changed its course from 133 degrees to 150 degrees compass bearing, the speed to have been reduced to one-half, and at 8.07 the engines to have been stopped; at 8.08 the whistle of Dagmar is said to have been first heard; the white masthead light of Dagmar to have been first seen at 8.10; at 8.10\u00bd the engines to have been put full astern; and at 8.11\u00bd the collision. But as of 8.06 and on, these times, taken from the entries on the deck log, were found to be unreliable and were disregarded by the trial judge.\nThe Dagmar puts the position of the collision at a point two miles northwest by west from Double Bluff buoy. As located on the chart, the point is 7\/10 of a mile west of a line drawn through the buoy to Bush Point. The Chinook places it much farther to the north, at a point 1.1 miles, 210 degrees true, from Bush Point. From an examination of the evidence and the charts, and keeping in mind the fact that Smith J. at the trial remarked both on the frankness of the pilot of Dagmar and on the unsatisfactory testimony of officers of Chinook and disregarded the deck log of Chinook, I have come to the conclusion that the collision took place approximately at the point and time fixed by Dagmar, a finding which the trial judge 2 did not find it necessary to make. Disregarding that as well as what he considered other subordinate con- siderations, he placed his judgment on two overriding factors: first, the disregard by Dagmar of a general practice of vessels on this seaway to pass port to port; and the excessive speed of both. The former, in effect, superseded all questionable behaviour other than speed on the part of Chinook, and by reason of it he charged Dagmar with two-thirds and Chinook with one-third of responsibility. I agree with his findings of excessive speed, but I must qualify in some respects the effect of his finding of a violation of the practice.\nIt was not contended that the waterway was a narrow channel within the meaning of Article 25 of the Inland Navigation Rules governing the vessels here, and there was, therefore, no rule requiring the vessels to pass port to port. Nor was it contended that there was any invariable custom binding the vessels to a port passing; at most, and the point was mentioned neither in the preliminary Act nor in the statement of claim, it was the \"usual practice\", more frequent than not; the question itself seems to have been brought up casually or incidentally in the course of the evidence. There was, therefore, no legal or quasi-legal obstacle to a starboard passing; but the practice is a circumstance relevant to the actual navigation of a vessel proceeding on the northerly run.\nThe Dagmar at one-half a mile off Double Bluff buoy was on the course that would ordinarily be taken for a port passing; for two minutes, immediately after the radar indication of Chinook, that course was maintained; then for three minutes there was the five degree and for six minutes the 15 degree alteration, the latter with the engines stopped. This seems to me to have been a faulty initiation of a starboard passing. The original indication was of a vessel approaching \"pretty fast\"; on the testimony of the first officer of Dagmar who attended the radar screen, the outline of a ship on the screen at a distance of several miles may take up five or six degrees: her position is thus somewhat approximate: and assuming radar equipment in the other vessel, a departure of five degrees from a course would not at once be apparent. There was nothing to prevent the swing of 15 or even 20 degrees from the first sighting to take Dagmar without delay out of the easterly lane preparatory to a starboard passing. The result of the failure to do this was that the accident took place within the range of the usual northbound course of Chinook itself which may be taken to be that of ships, generally, observing the practice. In the existing conditions of fog and courses, there was an obvious risk of becoming involved with the incoming vessel, whatever her equipment; and to that extent, I agree with the trial judge that the actual position of Dagmar introduced an element of potential danger.\nOn the other hand, Chinook, relying on radar and the stopping power of its engines, was travelling at a speed that, in the absence of radar, would have been greatly excessive, and it called for unremitting attention to the screen and the sharpest appreciation of what it revealed. If radar is to furnish a new sight through fog, then the report which it brings must be interpreted by active and constant intelligence on the part of the operator.\nIt is a general rule as old as navigation that in fog, when by one vessel the course of another within a danger zone is not yet ascertained, without sufficient indication to justify action, no change of course should be made: Vindo-mora v. Haswell 3; and in The \"Wear\" 4 Hill, J. used this language:\nIt has been said over and over again in this court that when in a fog you sight a ship whose direction or course you do not know the worst thing you can do is to take helm action.\nThe same principle was applied in Crown Steamship v. Eastern Navigation Co.5, \"Lundy\" v. \"Miltistone\" 6, and in the \"Rona\" and the \"Ava\" 7. On the evidence, chiefly of the independent witness, Gordon, a passenger on Chinook, I take the fact to have been that the engines of Chinook were still working when the exchange of whistle signals was on between the vessels and when Chinook, in his opinion, swung to starboard about 20 degrees. With Smith, J., I take this as the change in course of 17 degrees which Chinook claims to have made at 8.06, and likewise I take it to be the swing to starboard noticed on board Dagmar and recorded as at 8.11 in the order for full speed astern. That change, in the circumstances, would have been bad seamanship in the absence of radar, but it was much more so in the presence of unattended radar and under the speed which radar was felt to have made safe. If the original course had been maintained or if, at that point, the engines had been reversed, the accident would have been avoided; and if the radar screen had been closely and accurately observed, the course of Dagmar would have been made clear and the risk eliminated. That blind action at the critical moment was primarily responsible for what took place.\nThis last circumstance has not, in the attribution of fault, been taken into account by the trial judge. I would, therefore, reverse his percentage findings and hold Chinook responsible for two-thirds and Dagmar for one-third of the damages. The costs in both courts should be in the same percentages to both parties.\nThe dissenting judgment of Estey and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nEstey J.:\u2014These actions arise out of a collision between the motor ship Chinook and the Swedish vessel Dagmar Salen between Double Bluff and Bush Point in Puget Sound, U.S.A., on the evening of September 28, 1947. The cross actions claiming damages were consolidated and tried in the British Columbia Admiralty District 8.\nThe learned trial judge found:\nBoth vessels must be held blameworthy. Both were proceeding at too great speed, the Chinook originally, and the Dagmar Salen as she approached the fog-shrouded area. Both failed to reduce sufficiently when their respective radars (properly observed) gave indication of the other's approach on a bearing that changed but little, if it changed at all\nand again:\nI think, however, that the main fault (apart from excessive speed) lay with the Dagmar Salen. She knew that the customary rule was for north and south bound vessels to pass port to port, yet she chose to pass starboard to starboard.\nThe learned trial judge found that two-thirds of the fault rested with the Dagmar Salen and one-third with the Chinook and apportioned the liability accordingly.\nThe Dagmar Salen appeals, contending that it was not at fault and, therefore, the action should be dismissed or, alternatively, that the Chinook be found to be more blameworthy and the apportionment of liability varied accord- ingly. The Chinook submits that the judgment at trial should be affirmed or, alternatively, that it be exonerated from fault and the Dagmar Salen held to be entirely at fault.\nThe Dagmar Salen had left Seattle and was proceeding outward through Puget Sound. She is a motor vessel of 5,000.65 tons gross, length 405 feet, beam 51 \u2022 3 feet, equipped with four six-cylinder Diesel engines of 1,100 Horse Power each and a single propeller. Upon this voyage she was carrying a general cargo of 7,000 tons.\nThe Chinook, a motor vessel ferrying between Victoria and Seattle, was inbound to Seattle. This motor vessel is of 4,106 tons gross, length 273.5 feet, beam 65.6 feet, equipped with four 1,600 Horse Power Diesel electric engines and twin propellers.\nThere was no fog at Double Bluff. A mile or two north thereof there was a dense fog which continued northward and covered the area around and beyond Bush Point. The Dagmar Salen, therefore, in proceeding outward bound at Double Bluff, was not in the fog, but did enter the fog a mile or two beyond.\nBoth vessels were equipped with radar.\nThese ships were, at all relative times, subject to the United States \"Rules to Prevent Collisions of Vessels and Pilot Rules for Certain Inland Waters\". All courses and bearings given are magnetic.\nThe collision occurred between Double Bluff and Bush Point and, due to a difference in their respective clocks, the Chinook fixed the time at 20.11\u00bd and the Dagmar Salen at 20.14.\nIt will be convenient to deal first with the learned judge's finding that the Dagmar Salen was the greater in fault because she violated the customary rule of port-to-port passing. On behalf of the Dagmar Salen it is contended that this requirement of a port-to-port passing was not proved and, even if it was, the Pilot had a right, in the circumstances, to attempt a starboard-to-starboard passing.\nThe Pilot of the Dagmar Salen deposed:\n\u2026 it is a common practice amongst the local pilots to follow a course outbound close on the Whidby Island shore, passing Bush Point approxi- mately half a mile off. Inbound vessels usually steer southbound from Marrowstone, a course to pass Bush Point at least one and a quarter miles off, which always results in a port-to-port meeting.\nAs to his own practice he stated:\nAlso due to the fact in running a course from Double Bluff to Bush Point I considered it good seamanship to stay on the right side of the channel, which I follow at all times, \u2026\nand then as to the trip in question he stated:\nWell, I am sure I must have realized it was a vessel approaching before I ever altered course. If it was a vessel going the same way I was, I don't think I would have made any alteration, because I was on a track that I have followed out there ever since I have been piloting, and before that.\nThe Master of the Chinook deposed that vessels pass \"port-to-port as a rule\" and when questioned as to the northbound vessels he stated:\nAll the vessels steer the same course. It does not make any difference in the size, close on Double Bluff and approximately half a mile off Bush Point.\nThis evidence is not in any way contradicted. While it does not establish a port-to-port passing as an absolute rule, it supports the learned trial judge's finding that there existed a \"well-established practice\" requiring a port-to-port passing.\nAt 20.00 o'clock visibility was fair. The Dagmar Salen, as the Pilot estimated, was then three-tenths of a mile off the buoy at Double Bluff. At 20.03 the Chief Officer informed the Pilot of a target in the vicinity of Bush Point at a distance which he fixed to be four and one-half miles. The target was in the fog and this information was obtained from the radar screen. The Pilot himself examined the radar. At first he could not determine what it was. Then he thought it might have been \"a small craft in on the point bound for Mutiny Bay\". However, he soon concluded that it was \"a vessel approaching\" and the Chief Officer estimated that it was passing a half mile off Bush Point. (The approaching vessel was, in fact, the Chinook).\nIn that position off Bush Point the Chinook would be following the usual course of outbound vessels and, therefore, well off its usual inbound course. Both the Pilot and the Chief Officer of the Dagmar Salen make it clear that from the radar they could only approximately determine the position of the Chinook off Bush Point. The latter thought he could do so within four or five degrees. The Pilot himself deposed: \"it was hard for me to estimate her exact position.\" The truth of this statement is emphasized by the fact that when asked, at his examination for discovery, the position of the Chinook off Bush Point he replied:\nI truthfully don't know; I don't want to answer the question.\nHe also stated that \"it is impossible to tell on a radar if it is on a parallel course at that distance.\" Nevertheless he concluded that the Chinook was proceeding \"on a parallel course, following the left-hand channel southbound,\" which he described as \"a peculiar course.\" In these circumstances, at or about 20.05, the Pilot, having concluded the position of the Chinook to be half a mile off Bush Point and that the Dagmar Salen was drawing 24 feet aft, decided he must keep away from the shallow water which he described as \"the 4-fathom spot approximately 2\u00bd miles, or 3 miles south of Bush Point\" and that he should make a starboard-to-starboard passing. It was at 20.05 he entered the fog and altered his course five degrees to port, or from 305 to 300 degrees.\nThe Master of the Chinook determined by his radar that he passed one and one-quarter miles off Bush Point. The learned trial judge thought \"it was rather less\u2014certainly not more than one mile.\" This distance of a mile would not have made it difficult for the Dagmar Salen to pass Bush Point upon her regular course outbound and would not have interfered with a port-to-port passing, which apparently the Pilot of the Dagmar Salen intended and only abandoned because he thought the Chinook was a half mile off Bush Point.\nIt was contended that the area here in question constituted a narrow channel within the meaning of Art. 25 under which a \"steam vessel shall, when it is safe and practicable, keep to that side of the fairway or mid-channel which lies on the starboard side of such vessel.\" However, it is important to note that the general rule followed in this area is to the same effect. Vessels outward bound follow the east and those inbound the west side of this channel. If the Dagmar Salen was right in fixing the location of the Chinook off Bush Point she was well over in the outbound channel and, as the Pilot of the Dagmar Salen stated, she was following \"a peculiar course.\"\nMoreover, at Bush Point the Chinook was following a course of 133 degrees and at Double Bluff the Dagmar Salen was following a course of 305 degrees. The learned judge stated that at that time their courses intersected at an angle of only eight degrees and added: \"I think there can be little doubt that the Chinook then had the Dagmar Salen closely on her port bow, while the Dagmar Salen had the Chinook very slightly on her starboard bow.\"\nThe Chinook was in the fog, but would be emerging therefrom in a few minutes. The Dagmar Salen did not enter the fog until it was aware of and had concluded that the Chinook was upon a peculiar course. In these circumstances it would have been, as the learned trial judge points out, good seamanship on the part of the Dagmar Salen to have proceeded with caution and not to have altered her course, as she did, to port. The Vindomora 9; The Counsellor 10; and 30 Halsbury, 2nd ed., p. 733, para. 944.\nThe Pilot's decision to make a starboard-to-starboard passing was made, therefore, just before he entered the fog, in relation to a vessel, itself in the fog and approaching him upon a peculiar course, the position of which was at most only approximately ascertained. This explanation on the part of the Pilot in justification of his decision was described by the learned trial judge as \"unconvincing.\"\nNot only was the decision of the Pilot of the Dagmar Salen to attempt a starboard-to-starboard passing not justified in the circumstances, but, having made that decision, he continued to conduct his vessel in a manner that, upon the evidence, cannot be accepted as good seamanship.\nArt. 16 of the above-mentioned Inland Rules reads:\nArt. 16. Every vessel shall, in a fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy-rain storm, go at a moderate speed, having careful regard to the existing circumstances and conditions. A steam vessel hearing, apparently forward of her beam, the fog signal of a vessel the position of which is not ascertained shall, so far as the circumstances of the case admit, stop her engines, and then navigate with caution until danger of collision is over. Neither at 20.05, when the Dagmar Salen entered the fog and altered its course five degrees to port, nor at 20.08, when it altered its course a further ten degrees to port, was the Chinook an ascertained vessel within the foregoing Art. 16, as explained by Lord Macmillan in Nippon Yusen Kaisha v. China Navigation Co.11:\nIn order that the position of a vessel may be ascertained by another vessel within the meaning of the Article she must be known by that other vessel to be in such a position that both vessels can safely proceed without risk of collision.\nThe Pilot, notwithstanding that the Chinook was then an unascertained vessel, altered its course to port and attempted a starboard-to-starboard passing which, under the circumstances of fog, and having regard to the usual courses of vessels and the passing rule in this area, would tend to confuse the Master or Pilot of an approaching vessel and be more likely to increase than to diminish the possibility of a collision.\nThis alteration in course was contrary to the rule as expressed by Lord Watson in The \"Vindomora\" supra at p. 8:\n\u2026 that when a vessel at sea, overtaken by a fog, becomes aware that another vessel is in her neighbourhood she ought, whilst complying with the regulations as to speed, to keep on her course unless she has some indications more or less reliable that it would be proper or at least safe to change it.\nIt cannot be said, upon the Pilot's own evidence, that he had indications \"more or less reliable\" that justified his alteration to port in order to make a starboard-to-starboard passing. He, of course, knew the Chinook was in the fog, but, upon his own evidence, he did not know, with a reasonable degree of certainty, its position off Bush Point, nor did he have, at any relevant time, sufficient, if, indeed, any, reason to believe that the Chinook would not follow the usual course and pass port to port. His evidence that he concluded the Chinook was half a mile off Bush Point is a part thereof which the learned trial judge described as \"unconvincing.\" A reading of this evidence leaves the same impression. His statement that he concluded the Chinook was half a mile off Bush Point must be read with the other portions of his evidence, which have already been mentioned, to the effect that it was hard for him \"to estimate her exact position\" and his earlier statement, upon discovery, that he did not know her position off Bush Point. That appears to be the only point at which he attempted to determine her distance off shore, being thereafter content with his conclusions from the radar that the Chinook remained on his starboard bow. Apart from the difficulties he had in determining the exact locations on the radar, he himself had altered the Dagmar Salen twice to port, which would appear to leave the Chinook upon his starboard bow for some time even after she would be attempting a port-to-port passing. All these circumstances of fog, the Chinook's unusual position and the practice of a port-to-port passing, would require, as prudent and seamanlike conduct, that the Dagmar Salen should have proceeded with caution and upon the expectation that the usual practice would have been followed by the Chinook at least until such time as she had given sufficient indication to the contrary. Toronto Railway Company v. King 12. In this connection the words of Lord Wright are also appropriate:\nNor does any one doubt that it should not be lightly assumed that a wrongdoing ship might not correct her error in time, and that it is not desirable to prejudice her repentance so long as action can properly be deferred.\nS.S. Heranger 13.\nThe Pilot of the Dagmar Salen did not know how long it would take to stop that vessel, but he did know, as he stated, that it was \"heavily loaded, and she carried her way.\" Its engines were stopped at 20.08 and, notwithstanding that his radar indicated only the approximate position of the Chinook, the Pilot waited until 20.11 when he heard the first fog signal from the Chinook before putting his engines full astern, with the result that the Dagmar Salen had headway at the point of collision. The Pilot was, therefore, proceeding without knowing whether he could avoid the Chinook once it might come into sight. His conduct was in disregard of the general rule requiring that only such speed should be maintained in the fog after the presence of a nearby vessel is known as will permit the avoiding of that vessel once it is seen. The Campania 14; The Oceanic 15; The Counsellor16. The Chinook was also at fault. It was, at all times material hereto, in the fog. The Master admits that he observed upon his radar screen a vessel which he subsequently found to be the Dagmar Salen when he was off Bush Point. The learned trial judge was not convinced that the Master of the Chinook \"paid any proper attention to the radar screen during the vital eight minutes preceding the collision;\" and further that he did \"not altogether accept the evidence given by the Chinook's Master and Chief Officer.\" These comments are fully justified upon the evidence. It is, however, clear that the learned trial judge accepted the Master's evidence that he altered his course from 138 to 150 degrees, but did not accept his evidence as to the time of his making this alteration, in regard to which he stated: \"The exact time when the Chinook made this alteration is one of the unsettled features of her evidence.\"\nThe appellant's contention that the Chinook's alteration from 133 to 150 degrees was not more than three minutes before the collision was not established by the evidence. The learned trial judge has already indicated that he did not accept the evidence of the officers of the Chinook that it was made at 20.06, nor does he accept the evidence of other parties who sought to fix that time. The evidence of Gordon, upon which the appellant laid great stress, goes no further upon this point than to state that when he heard the fog whistle of the Dagmar Salen the Chinook was swinging slowly to starboard and he estimated it was a twenty-degree swing up to the moment of the impact. It was only an estimate and he did not speak with certainty as to any time. All of the evidence upon this point supports the view of the learned trial judge that the time of this alteration cannot be fixed.\nApart, however, from the exact time of the making of this alteration, it was admittedly made after the Master of the Chinook was aware of the near presence of the Dagmar Salen, which vessel, upon his own evidence, could not be regarded as ascertained. Whether he was or was not upon his usual course and notwithstanding the customary rule of a port-to-port passing, his vessel was in the fog and, in these circumstances, this alteration constituted negligence on the part of the Master of the Chinook. The contention that the practice of a port-to-port passing does not obtain in the fog is well founded to the extent that, instead of their following the rules as where visibility is such that vessels can be checked, good seamanship requires that every move must be determined by the circumstances and one of the primary rules appears to be that, once a vessel is known to be nearby, engines should be stopped and no change in course should be made until such vessel is ascertained. Neither of the vessels here observed this rule. The action of the Dagmar Salen in entering the fog when the approaching vessel was pursuing a peculiar course upon which it was not ascertained, and in making the alteration to port in these circumstances, constituted the greater negligence.\nThe appellant's submission that the entire cause of the collision should be attributed to the conduct of the Chinook cannot be supported upon the evidence. In support of this contention it is submitted that had the Chinook used reasonable care it would have observed the Dagmar Salen's alteration to port and realized it had decided upon a starboard-to-starboard passing and would not have altered its course seventeen degrees to starboard, or from 133 to 150 degrees. It is not established at what time the Chinook made this alteration. Even if the Master of the Chinook had been giving sufficient attention to his radar and observed the Dagmar Salen had altered her course to port, it does not at all follow that the reasonable man in the Master's position would, as he first noticed that alteration, have concluded that the Dagmar Salen had decided upon and was making a starboard-to-starboard passing. It was an unusual course and there was no reason therefor so far as the Chinook was concerned. At what time, in these circumstances, the Master of the Chinook ought to have concluded that the starboard-to-starboard passing was being attempted by the Dagmar Salen it is not possible to determine, nor can it be determined whether at that time he could have done more than he actually did do. Moreover, there would be a period after he noticed the Dagmar Salen's alteration during which the Master of the Chinook would be apprehensive lest at any moment the Dagmar Salen would again alter its course to effect the usual port-to-port passing and should, therefore, stop his engines. We cannot know, because the learned trial judge did not accept his log nor his evidence, at what point he did stop his engines. This, however, is established, that at some time before the Dagmar Salen came into sight some 400 yards distant the Chinook had stopped its engines and placed them in reverse so that at the point of collision the Chinook had no headway. Under these circumstances the evidence does not establish that the Chinook is entirely to blame, but rather, when read as a whole, supports the view that both were negligent and that such negligence continued up to and contributed to the collision.\nWhile the learned trial judge's finding \"that at the time of the collision neither vessel had more than trifling headway, that each was blowing the appropriate fog signals, and that each gave the full astern signal\" is generally supported by the evidence, a careful reading thereof indicates an important difference between the Chinook and the Dagmar Salen in this respect, that the Chinook was either dead in the water or proceeding slightly astern at the time of the collision, while the Dagmar Salen still had a slight headway. Not only is this to be gathered from the evidence of the various witnesses, but the point of collision and the consequent damage make this rather clear. The stem of the Dagmar Salen collided with the Chinook \"right at the wing of the bridge on the port side\" and the nature and character of the damage would indicate that the Chinook was not making headway at that time. Gordon and Holmes, who, in their respective positions, had an opportunity to observe the vessels as they approached each other, both agreed that the impact on the Chinook was aft of where they thought it would be\u2014Holmes says to a point of 25 or 30 feet\u2014which would indicate that the Chinook was dead in the water, or slightly astern. This is rather important in assessing the degree of fault to be attributed to each of these vessels, as it tends to show that at the critical time the officers of the Chinook had the better control of their vessel. It is true the evidence establishes that the way of the Chinook could be run off rather quickly. That, however, was only a circumstance to be taken into account by those in charge. Against this the Pilot of the Dagmar Salen did not know how much time it would take to run off the way of that vessel and did not adequately provide for either his lack of knowledge in this regard, or the fact that he had a two-knot tide in his favour.\nThe parties differed as to the place of the collision. They respectively placed it at points separated by a distance of one and one-half miles, each locating the place of the collision upon or close to their respective courses, as they had deposed to them. The Dagmar Salen contended that, having regard to its speed and distance, it could not have reached the place where the Chinook said the collision occurred until some time after it admittedly did occur. The same contention was made on behalf of the Chinook in relation to the place of the collision as fixed by the Dagmar Salen. In fact, the discrepancies in the evidence were such that, having regard to the fact that all distances are more or less approximate and the respective times questioned, it is impossible to draw any conclusion of assistance to either party from the evidence as to the point of collision.\nBoth of these vessels were equipped with radar. The learned trial judge was of the opinion that the Chief Officer on the Chinook had \"paid no attention to it\" after 19.50 and, as to the Master, he did not pay \"any proper attention to the radar screen during the vital eight minutes preceding the collision.\" On the other hand he was satisfied that the Chief Officer on the Dagmar Salen did pay proper attention to the radar but on this ship, while they made more continuous and accurate observations, \"they, too, changed too narrowly to permit of a safe distance for passing in fog.\" The radar is no doubt of the greatest assistance to navigation in the fog, provided the reading of the screen is made with care and that, having regard to what is there disclosed, reasonable precautions are taken. In this case it would seem that on the Chinook sufficient attention was not paid to the radar, while on the Dagmar Salen, although greater care was exercised in the use of the radar, the Pilot did not exercise the care that the radar indicated to be reasonably necessary.\nBoth of these vessels were at fault, but the greater must rest with the Dagmar Salen. In my opinion the learned trial judge arrived at the proper conclusions and his judgment should be affirmed and this appeal dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Campney, Owen, Clyne, Murphy and Owen.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Locke, Guild, Lane, Sheppard and Yule.\n1 [1950] Ex.

The increase permitted in the price of grade 2 gasoline was one cent per gallon. The appellants operated service stations in Montreal, Toronto and Windsor where they retailed grade 2 gasoline at a price lower than their competitors. They imported their supplies from Trinidad but following the outbreak of war this source was cut off and they were forced to import from the U.S.A. at a higher cost. In November and December 1941, the Wartime Prices and Trade Board issued two statements of policy announcing the coming into force of a complete control of all prices, and that higher prices would not be permitted than those at which goods were actually sold during the four weeks Sept. 15 to Oct. 11, but that importers could continue to import in the normal manner with the assurance that appropriate subsidies would be provided. The appellants construed the Order to restrict the price increase permitted them to one cent per gallon above the price at which gasoline had been sold at their various \"places of business\", i.e., each service station. Their application for a subsidy was refused by the Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation on the ground that there were similar goods available in Canada at a reasonable price and that the price ceiling was not on an individual but on a geographical basis and the appellants could have increased their price to that of their competitors.\nAn appeal was taken to the Exchequer Court of Canada where the ruling of the Corporation was upheld.\nHeld: that the expression \"in any place\" used in the Orders of the Oil Controller of Oct. 1, 1941, and Jan. 28, 1942, was ambiguous and the appellants' application for subsidies had been refused on a misconstruction of such Orders: the judgment appealed from should therefore be set aside and the matter referred back to the Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation to deal with such claims on the footing that the Orders permitted the appellants to increase their prices only to the extent of one cent per gallon on Sept. 30, 1941.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Court of Exchequer, O'Connor J. 1 dismissing suppliants' Petition of Right by which they claimed to be entitled to, and sought to recover from His Majesty, subsidies on motor gasoline imported by them in the period December 1, 1941 to July 1, 1942.\nJ. J. Robinette K.C. and W. H. Thompson K.C. for the appellants.\nHugh O'Donnell K.C. and Luc Andr\u00e9 Couture for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice, Locke and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\nLocke J.:\u2014The disposition to be made of the present matter depends, in my opinion, upon the construction to be placed upon the language of the Orders of the Oil Controller of October 21, 1941, and January 28, 1942. That the expression \"in any place\" in these Orders is ambiguous is undoubted and it is accordingly necessary, in order to resolve the question, to examine such of the documents as may properly be referred to in order to construe the language.\nIt was by Order-in-Council P.C. 2516 made on September 3, 1939, that the Wartime Prices and Trade Board was constituted in the exercise of powers conferred upon the Governor General in Council by The War Measures Act, 1914, and by the Regulations then enacted the Board was empowered, inter alia, to fix maximum prices or margins of profit at which any necessary of life might be sold or offered for sale in Canada by manufacturers, producers, jobbers, wholesalers or retailers. P.C. 3398 made on December 5, 1939, rescinded P.C. 2516 and enacted Regulations which defined more fully the duties and powers of the Board. By Order-in-Council P.C. 2715 of June 24, 1940, a Wartime Industries Control Board was set up, to consist of the Controllers from time to time appointed by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Munitions and Supply, and by Order-in-Council P.C. 2818 made on June 28, 1940, regulations respecting oil were made and George R. Cottrelle appointed oil controller with powers which included that of fixing, with the approval of the Minister of Munitions and Supply, maximum prices or maximum markups at which oil and oil products might be sold or offered for sale. Order-in-Council P.C. 1195 of February 19, 1941, rescinded the regulations respecting oil enacted by P.C. 2818 and substituted new regulations which, inter alia, empowered the oil controller, subject to the approval of the Minister of Munitions and Supply, to fix or regulate the price or fix the minimum or maximum price at which oil might be sold \"in any place, area or zone\", and further:\nto prohibit or regulate any practice or mode of dealing in or with oil or related thereto or used or followed in connection therewith which, in the judgment of the Oil Controller, would or might increase or tend to increase the price of oil to any person or class of persons or which would or might affect or tend to affect the orderely purchase, sale or distribution of oil;\nand, subject to the approval of the Minister, to fix or limit the quantity of any oil which might be sold or distributed by any person or classes of persons for any specified use.\nOrder-in-Council P.C. 6834 of August 28, 1941, rescinded the regulations of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board enacted by P.C. 3998 as thereafter amended. The recital to this order declared in part that it was deemed to be in the national interest that the Wartime Prices and Trade Board regulations should be extended to goods and services not within the jurisdiction of the Wartime Industries Control Board or any of the various controllers that had been appointed:\nin order that, in co-operation with other governmental departments and agencies, there may be co-ordination of administrative action in respect of good and services;\nand that it was deemed desirable that public control of the prices of goods or services, when imposed, should be exercised by or with the concurrence of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, and that to effectuate such purpose it was necessary to establish new regulations in regard to the operations of that board. The powers of the board were declared to include that of fixing specific or maximum or minimum prices or markups at which any goods or services might be sold. By a further Order-in-Council P.C. 6835 of August 29, 1941, the order of June 24, 1940 was amended and regulations were prescribed for the operations of the Wartime Industries Control Board and the powers of that board and of its members defined with particularity. The preamble to this Order-in-Council recited, inter alia, that in view of the increasing complexity of the duties of the various controllers and of the problems which confronted them and of the fact that the functions and duties of each of them were to a considerable degree interdependent and correlated, not only with those of other controllers but with those of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, it was deemed advisable to take further measures to promote co-ordination and integration of the functions and activities of such controllers and by creating a closer relationship between them and the Wartime Industries Control Board and the Wartime Prices and Trade Board \"to promote cooperation between them and reduce the possibility of any confusion arising as a result of the exercise and discharge of their various powers, functions and duties.\" The regulations made were designed to effectuate that purpose. Regulation 8 provided that every controller should have power, subject to the approval of the chairman of the Wartime Industries Control Board and the concurrence of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board to fix maximum prices or markups at which any goods under his jurisdiction might be sold or offered for sale generally or in any place, area or zone. Regulation 10 (iii) authorized each controller to exercise his powers in respect of, or in relation to, such things:\neither generally throughout Canada or in any particular province, place, area, zone or locality designated by the Controller.\nOn September 26, 1941, the oil controller in the exercise of the powers conferred on him by Orders-in-Council P.C. 2818, 1195 and 6835 and, with the approval of the chairman of the Wartime Industries Control Board and presumably the concurrence of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, revoked his prior order 008 and by order 008A directed, inter alia, that after October 1, 1941, no person should sell any motor fuel (defined in a manner to include gasoline and lubricating oil) other than graded motor fuel as defined by the order. Further terms of the order were designed to restrict and control the quality and quantities of motor fuel sold in Canada required that all such fuel delivered to passenger cars should be obtained only from service stations. Thereafter P.C. 6835 was amended by P.C. 7824 adopted on October 8, 1941, but effective as of August 29, 1941, whereby subsection 1 of section 8 of the prior order was rescinded and the powers of the controllers to regulate prices and to fix maximum or minimum prices declared to be exercisable only with the concurrence of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board in lieu of that of the Minister of Munitions and Supply.\nIt was under these circumstances that the oil controller issued order No. 010 dated October 21, 1941. While his powers permitted him to establish maximum prices in any \"area, place or zone\", the price fixed was that to be paid \"in any place.\" In so far as is relevant to the present inquiry the order read:\n9. From and after the date of this Order, the price to be paid for petroleum products, or any of them, by any purchaser thereof shall be regulated as follows:\n(a) The price to be paid in any place shall not exceed the maximum price at which any such petroleum product was sold or offered for sale in such place or for delivery to such place on the 30th day of September. 1941. plus any applicable price increase confirmed, authorized or required by this Order and having regard to the quantity purchased;\n(b) For the purposes of the foregoing clause (a) as applied to graded motor fuel, the maximum price applicable in any place on the 30th day of September, 1941, shall be ascertained having regard to the price of motor fuel having the same or the nearest qualities to those specified by Order 008A for either grade of graded motor fuel;\n(c) No greater price shall be charged to any person for petroleum products or any of them than that provided by paragraph 7 and by this paragraph 9 of this Order.\n10. Any person who sells petroleum products, or any of them, at a price greater than is authorized by this Order as applicable at the place of delivery thereof, shall be guilty of a breach of this Order and liable to the penalties provided by law.\nThe increase permitted to be made in the price of grade 2 motor fuel, being the quality sold by the appellant, was 1 cent per imperial gallon \"in any place.\" This order was approved by the chairman of the Wartime Industries Control Board and of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board.\nOn November 1, 1941, Order-in-Council P.C. 8527 was adopted on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance establishing what were described as the Maximum Prices Regulations to be administered by the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. The order defined the expression \"goods\" as including any articles, commodities, substances or things and provided that the maximum price at which any goods might be sold should be the highest lawful price at which a person sold or supplied goods of that nature during the basic period, being the four weeks from September 15, 1941, to October 11, 1941, both inclusive. After providing that no person should after November 17, 1941, sell goods at prices higher than the maximum price for such goods as provided in the regulations, unless otherwise permitted under their provisions, it was provided inter alia that:\n3. (7) For the purposes of these regulations, each separate place of business of a seller or supplier shall be deemed to be a separate seller or supplier.\nSection 4 provided in part that:\n4. The provisions of Section 3 of these Regulations shall not apply with respect to:\n* * *\n(g) any price fixed by the Board, or fixed or approved by any other federal, provincial or other authority with the written concurrence of the Board.\nand Section 5(1) that:\nWhere under any other law any federal, provincial or other authority has jurisdiction with respect to prices, or with respect to the supplying of or trading in goods or services, such jurisdiction shall not be deemed to be superseded by these regulations or by any action of the Board. except that any action heretofore taken or that may hereafter be taken under such jurisdiction which is repugnant to any of the provisions of these regulations or to any action of the Board pursuant to its powers shall be of no force or effect so long as and to the extent that it is so repugnant.\n(2) No such federal, provincial or other authority shall fix or approve any specific, minimum or maximum prices or markups in respect of any goods or services without the written concurrence of the Board.\nHeavy penalties were prescribed for any breach of the regulations which were declared to be punishable, either upon indictment or upon summary conviction under part 15 of the Criminal Code, and it was declared that the regulations were to be read and construed as one with the Wartime Prices and Trade Regulations which, as above indicated, had been adopted by Order-in-Council P.C. 2516 on September 3, 1939. On the same date P.C. 8528 rescinded the Wartime Prices and Trade Board regulations made by P.C. 6834 and prescribed new regulations, which included the power to fix specific or maximum prices or markups at which any goods might be sold and extended the powers of the board to take measures deemed desirable in the national interest, for the purpose of restraining increases in the cost of living.\nOn November 21, 1941, the Wartime Prices and Trade Board published what was called its \"Preliminary Statement of Policy\", reciting the reasons which had led the government to decide upon a complete control of all prices to become effective on the first of the following month, and outlining generally the steps proposed to be taken to make such control effective. Since the operations of the oil controller were but part of the general scheme of price control and were exercisable only with the approval of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, the terms of this statement are to be considered. After stating that higher prices would not be permitted than those at which goods were actually sold during the four weeks September 15 to October 11 and that the fundamental duty of the board was to see that prices would not rise higher than the level reached during this basic period, it was said that in particular the prices paid by consumers of goods and services must not rise and that such consumers might not lawfully be charged more for any goods than the highest price charged by the storekeeper or supplier of such goods during that period. It was declared that the price ceiling applied to each individual store department or branch on the basis of its own prices for each separate kind and quality of goods during the basic period, that the lower-price stores were not permitted to raise their prices to the level of the higher-price stores. Those engaged in selling goods at retail were directed that, if necessary, they must reduce their prices on December 1, so that no price should be higher than the highest price charged by the same store, branch or department of a department store for goods of the same kind and quality during the basic period, and dealers were warned that any price increases above that level would render them liable to prosecution and to have their licences to do business suspended or cancelled. The statement further indicated that if the burden of restraining prices fell too heavily upon an industry the board would recommend to the government that the people as a whole should take a share of the burden and that subsidies be granted or the price of raw materials controlled. It was stated that it was intended to establish a government corporation to deal with cases in which it might be deemed advisable to stabilize raw material cost. Dealing with those engaged in the import of goods the statement declared that the whole question of imports in relation to the price ceiling was being studied by the board and that a statement of policy might be expected in the near future.\nOn December 2, 1941, the board issued a further statement of its import policy. Since it is contended by the appellants that in the circumstances of the present case they had acquired contractual rights as against the Crown, its terms are of importance. Dealing with goods imported for civilian purposes, within which class those of the appellants fell, it was said that the general principle was that imported goods would in general cost the importer no more than was appropriate in relation to retail selling prices and that:\nImporters may, therefore, continue importing in the normal manner, with the assurance that appropriate subsidies will be provided with respect to goods imported on and after December 1, 1941, on the basis outlined below. The methods will in the first instance consist of direct subsidies to importers, with the possibility that from time to time duties and taxes on imported goods may be reduced in such a way as to make subsidies unnecessary.\nHaving said this, however, the above quoted statement was followed immediately by a clause stating that the board reserved the right to exclude any goods or kind of goods from the import subsidy, that it could not be expected to approve subsidies if the increase in import prices was not of significant proportions for those concerned, but that if the increased cost was greater than the amount which could reasonably be expected to be absorbed the board, acting whenever possible on the advice of its administrator, would set the subsidy at a reasonable level. It was further declared that importers must realize that the board in carrying out its import policy must have regard for the position of domestic producers and that:\ndiversion from domestic to foreign sources of supply, if not occasioned by a shortage of supplies in Canada, may require reduction or elimination of the subsidy with respect to such imports or exclusion of the importer concerned from the benefits of the subsidy system.\nIt was said further that subsidies would be paid on all eligible goods imported through normal trade channels for eventual sale to domestic consumers and that claims for subsidies were to be submitted monthly by all importers concerned. As to imports by retailers within which class the appellants fell, the statement proceeded:\nThe Board will endeavour to measure the amount of the subsidy in such a way that the retailer will receive his goods at a cost which is reasonable in relation to his retail ceiling price. It follows that those who maintained low retail prices during the basic period will be able to continue to sell at those prices without undue hardship. Each retailer who imports direct should prepare a list of his ceiling prices for imported goods.\nDealing with imported fuel, it was said that, inter alia, petroleum and its products \"will be dealt with on much the same basis as raw materials if circumstances so require.\" Having said that the document represented the most comprehensive general statement which could be made, importers were urged to have confidence that the board and the Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation (a Crown company later organized) would deal with individual problems \"fairly and reasonably\" and that at that time the important thing was that the import trade should be continued in accordance with past practice, even if the present import prices involved an actual loss to the importers concerned and that such subsidy adjustments would be made retroactive to December 1. The statement declared further that the organization of the Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation was proceeding and that it would supervise and handle subsidy arrangements in accordance with procedures to be thereafter established.\nOrder-in-Council P.C. 9870 of December 17, 1941, authorized the Minister of Finance to cause to be incorporated and organized a private company under the Companies Act to be wholly owned by His Majesty in right of the Dominion of Canada, to be known as Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation, with an authorized share capital:\nfor the purpose of facilitating, under the direction of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, the control of prices of goods, wares and merchandises in Canada.\nThe Board was authorized from time to time to delegate such of its powers to the company as it might deem advisable and the Minister of Finance was authorized to execute an agreement between His Majesty and the company in the terms of a draft annexed to the Order-in-Council, with such changes that he might consider proper, and from moneys appropriated by Parliament under the War Appropriation Act, 19141 the minister was authorized to direct advances from time to time up to the amount of $10,-000,000 for the purpose of paying, inter alia, sums by way of subsidy. The proposed agreement which was apparently executed on January 6, 1942, authorized the company in the discharge of such duties and responsibilities as might from time to time be delegated or committed to it by the Minister of Finance or the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, to pay such moneys by way, inter alia, of subsidies:\nto any person, firm or corporation as may be deemed advisable in accordance with the principles stipulated from time to time by the Wartime Prices and Trade Board and approved by the Minister.\nWhile this agreement was rescinded and replaced by a new agreement made on the following July, the substituted document in like manner required that any payments by way of subsidy should be in accordance with the principles formulated from time to time by the Wartime Prices and Trade Board.\nThe appellant companies were at the time of the outbreak of the Second World War and in the following years engaged in operating service stations in Montreal, Toronto and Windsor for the retail sale of gasoline and lubricating oils. Joy Oil Limited, incorporated in the Province of Quebec, operated in Montreal a marine terminal for the purpose of receiving gasoline by ocean tankers and distributing it to their service stations in the city of Montreal, and Joy Oil Company Limited, an Ontario corporation, operated a terminal in Toronto for the purpose of receiving supplies of gasoline by boat and also in tank cars for its service stations operated in the Toronto district. The gasoline sold by the Quebec company during the years 1940 and 1941 had been imported by water from Trinidad. This was also the source of the gasoline sold at its filling stations in Toronto throughout the year 1940 and for a portion of 1941. In the latter year, however, owing to the activities of enemy submarines, this source of supply was shut off and, according to the appellants, it was necessary for them to resort to the United States market for their supplies, this resulting in a large increase in their costs. The oil controller's order 010 provided that from and after its date (October 21, 1941) the price at which graded motor fuel might be offered for sale in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec should not exceed the maximum price at which such product was sold or offered for sale in such place on the 30th day of September, 1941, plus one cent per imperial gallon, the increase provided by the order. On that date the prices charged by both appellants for gasoline to consumers were substantially less than those charged by the large oil companies operating in Canada and it is this fact which renders the interpretation of the word \"place\" in the orders of the oil controller of decisive importance. In Quebec the price charged was 2.7 cents a gallon less than the prices charged by the large companies, while in Toronto it was approximately 4.7 cents lower.\nThe appellant companies interpreted order 010 as enabling them to increase the prices charged at each of their service stations by one cent above that charged at such station on September 30, 1941, and acted on that understanding. P.C. 1195 authorized the appointment of a deputy oil controller to have all of the powers of the oil controller, subject to any restrictions thereof which the latter might from time to time impose and subject in all cases to review by him. Charles E. Austin, the vice-president of both of the appellant companies said that, at a time which he thought preceded the date of order 010 having heard a rumor that an order was to be made, he had an interview with Stewart, the deputy oil controller, who informed him that each company was bound by its own prices which had been in effect, that the controller was following the policy of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, that each station was to be considered as a unit, and that the appellant companies could not raise their prices to the level of the other companies. Stewart was not called as a witness: Austin's evidence, however, as to the date of this discussion is vague and unsatisfactory. Whatever may be said as to its admissibility if the discussion took place following the making of the order, it was clearly inadmissible if it was before that date. On October 28, 1941, a week after the order had been made, the Joy Oil Company Limited wrote to the oil controller apparently asking an increase in their quota of supplies. The letter was not put in evidence and its contents can only be inferred from the written answer of Stewart as deputy oil controller on November 6, 1941. That letter referring to earlier orders of the board said in part:\nFurthermore, your application is based on a complete misunderstanding of the Order. You apparently entertain the view that a quota can be fixed for your Toronto division regardless of the gallonage dispensed at any unit within the Division. Paragraph 6 of Order 007 has not been affected by the amendments contained in 007A and 007B.\nThis paragraph makes it clear that every station operated by your Company is prohibited from selling more than its particular quota. If any station operated by your Company is permitted to sell more gasoline than the quota applicable to such station, the result is clearly a breach of the Order.\nYour application for an increased quota for the Toronto Division cannot be entertained as it is utterly inconsistent with the terms and principles of the Order. Any application made under paragraph 4D of Order 007B must be in respect of an individual station but, as mentioned above, any such application cannot be granted if based only on the consequences of competitive practices.\nAccording to Austin, after receiving this letter he was referred by Stewart to Frederick G. Cottle, a chartered accountant, apparently acting as executive assistant to the oil controller, and was informed by him that he agreed with Stewart's construction of the earlier orders and that the regulations of the oil controller were based on treating each gasoline station as a separate unit, both in so far as prices and the allocation of gasoline under the rationing order were concerned. This evidence was admitted without objection. Cottle, called by the Grown, while admitting the discussion as to the earlier orders referred to in the letter of November 6, 1941, said first that he could recall no discussion on that occasion or any other occasion with Austin regarding prices and that he had not told or would not have told him that individual stations were the basis for the administration of order 010 \"for the simple reason that it was not true\". When Austin, when recalled later, repeated the statement as to what Cottle had said and the Crown was permitted to recall Cottle he than said that he had no recollection at any time of ever discussing the meaning of order 010 with Austin and that, if he had, he was positive he would never have given the interpretation to him that he says. Cottle's evidence, when read as a whole, appears to be indecisive and more in the nature of argument than a positive statement on the point. The learned trial judge, however, made no finding as to credibility as between these witnesses.\nThe claims advanced by the appellants in the present matter are in regard to their operations between December 1, 1941, and the latter part of June 1942. According to Austin, when supplies of gasoline imported from Trinidad were no longer available, he went to the oil controller to enlist his assistance in purchasing supplies and approached all the larger oil companies in an attempt to buy from them but without success, whereupon both companies commenced to import gasoline from the United States. According, however, to various witnesses employed by the larger oil companies, they had gasoline available for sale and the learned trial judge accepted the evidence of Frank G. Hall, a director of the Imperial Oil Limited, to the effect that graded gasoline was available which the appellants could have purchased at any time during the period in question at a tank wagon price of 17\u00bd cents in Toronto and 17 cents in Montreal, both prices exclusive of taxes. The contention of the appellants is that at these prices they could not have maintained the prices at the figure authorized by orders 010 and 010A of January 28, 1942, which revoked the prior order and substituted other regulations. The price increase in the latter order was, however, the same as that in order 010 for graded motor fuel, that is one cent per imperial gallon above the price in effect on September 30, 1941 \"in such place\". The necessity of importing from the United States substantially increased the cost of gasoline to both of the appellants and it is this fact which gives rise to the claims for subsidy.\nBy letter dated May 23, 1942, the appellant Joy Oil Company Limited filed its first application for a subsidy, explaining the circumstances which made it necessary to import their supplies from the United States. By letter dated July 14, 1942, the Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation Limited wrote in reply saying that the applications were rejected: the ground assigned for the rejection was that it had been stated in the statement of import policy of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board that no subsidy would be paid if similar goods were available in Canada at reasonable prices, that the information before the Corporation indicated that the maximum retail price of Grade 2 gasoline at Toronto, as established by the oil controller, was 32 \u2022 5 cents per gallon and that, accordingly, the applicants could have purchased supplies in Toronto at prices which would have allowed them to sell at this level and realize a fair profit. The statement referred to in this letter in the declaration of policy made by the Wartime Prices and Trade Board on December 2, 1941, was that it was fundamental that imported goods would not be eligible for subsidy if such goods could be obtained in Canada in sufficient volume and at reasonable prices, and followed earlier statements in the order that, as to retailers, those who maintained low retail prices during the basic period would be able to continue to sell at those prices without undue hardship, and urged importers to have confidence that the board and the Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation would deal with individual problems fairly and reasonably. Thus, while disclaiming the applicability of one term of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board policy statement, the corporation insisted on the application of another as an answer to the claim. A considerable correspondence followed between the Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation Limited and the solicitors for the appellants. The corporation maintained its stand and its grounds for the position taken. Ultimately, by letter dated November 18, 1942, the appellants, through their solicitors, made a lengthy submission to the Honour- able the Minister of Finance in which their position was fully stated. The Minister replied to this letter on March 11, 1943, saying that While the statement of policy of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board clearly referred only to goods affected by the Maximum Prices Regulations of December 1, 1941, he considered that vendors of petroleum products would also be entitled to claim for payment of subsidies if the same were necessary in order to enable them to sell at the selling price established under the oil controller's orders 010 and 010A. The letter further said in part:\nThe question as to whether the Joy Companies are entitled to receive payment of a subsidy would appear to depend upon the interpretation of the word \"place\" as contained in the Orders above referred to. If, as you contend, this word means \"place of business\", your clients are entitled to payment of a subsidy. If, on the other hand, it means a geographical area, i.e., a municipality or adjacent district, they are not, since my advice is that no subsidy would have been required to enable your clients to sell gasoline at the maximum price permitted in the Montreal and Toronto areas.\nand, after discussing the dictionary definition of the word \"place\", said that the question as to the interpretation to be placed upon the word, as used in the orders, had been submitted to the solicitor of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board for his opinion and that he had expressed the view that the word, as used in the orders, did not mean \"place of business\" but rather a geographical locality, and that accordingly the Minister had decided not to intervene.\nThe claim of the appellants is for a stated sum by way of subsidy on the footing that the Crown became indebted to them in these amounts. The claims are said to be based upon contract on the footing that there was an offer or promise extended to the appellants by an authorized agent of the Crown upon which \"the suppliants acted to their detriment\". By this, however, I understand it is meant that the statement and declarations of policy by the Wartime Prices and Trade Board were in effect an offer which had been accepted by them by importing supplies from the United States and selling them at the restricted prices. I agree with the conclusion of the learned trial judge that the claim cannot be sustained on this basis. The further contention that such a contractual relationship was \"ratified\" by the Minister of Finance in his letter to the solicitors for the appellants is not, in my opinion, well founded. I think that the letter was clearly not intended to be more than an expression of the Minister's view as to the decisive point in the matter and to indicate his intention to abide by the advice he had received from the solicitor for the Wartime Prices and Trade Board.\nI am, however, of the opinion that these conclusions should not dispose of these claims. Their rejection was based upon the grounds stated in the letter from the Commodity Prices Stabilization Board to the appellants of July 14, 1942, and in reliance upon the interpretation placed by the corporation on the language of the orders of the oil controller. If the proper interpretation of those orders is that the \"place\" referred to was the individual filling stations of the appellants in Toronto and Montreal and not those cities respectively, it is plain that there has been no consideration given to the claims for subsidy on their merits. The word \"place\" and the expression \"in any place\" are clearly capable of either meaning. The order of the oil controller does not fall within subsection (b) of section 2 of the Interpretation Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 1) and the provisions of that statute do not apply to its interpretation. In my opinion we are entitled, in order to assist in determining the meaning to be assigned to this language, to consider, in addition to the other terms of the orders, the Orders-in-Council which vested the powers in the controller in the exercise of which the order was made, the terms of the Orders-in-Council which constituted the Wartime Prices and Tirade Board and the other agencies set up for the purpose of controlling prices in Canada and the statements of policy and the regulations made by or on behalf of these various government agencies. The office of the oil controller constituted by Order-in-Council P.C. 2818 was merely to be one of the instruments used by the Wartime Prices and Trade Board to control prices and margins of profit in Canada. The power vested in the controller by P.C. 1195 to prohibit or regulate any mode of dealing which \"would or might increase or tend to increase the price of oil to any person or class of persons\" did not merely vest him with these powers but contemplated their exercise and this overall purpose of the plan was made manifest in all of the orders and regulations dealing with the subject of control. The oil controller was not to conduct a species of control differing from that to be applied to the sale of all other commodities or to act independently of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, except to the extent that that body should permit. The preamble to P.C. 6835 of August 29, 1941, which prescribed regulations for the Wartime Industries Control Board, stressed that the functions and duties of the various controllers were interdependent and correlated not only with those of other controllers but with the functions and duties of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, and that it was desirable to take further measures to promote co-ordination and integration of their activities by creating a closer relationship between them and the Wartime Industries Control Board and the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. It was with this end in view and with the purpose of ensuring uniformity of policy that the orders of the oil controller were made subject to the approval of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board in lieu of that of the Minister of Munitions and Supply, a change affected by P.C. 7824 of October 8, 1941. It is, I think, clear both from the language of P.C. 1195 and that of regulation 10 (iii), enacted by P.C. 6835, that the word \"place\" is not to be construed as synonymous with the words \"area\" or \"zone\" used in the former Order-in-Council, or with any of the words \"area, zone or locality\" used in the regulation. The fact that these words were used in addition to the word \"place\" indicates, in my opinion, a restricted meaning for the latter term. If the increase in price to be permitted by the order was one cent above the maximum charged in the cities of Toronto or Montreal or other centres of settlement on September 30, 1941, one would expect that, if not mentioned by name, the areas would have been at least generally defined as the city, town, village or locality within which the businesses affected were carried on. When, shortly after order 010 was made, the appellant Joy Oil Company Limited asked for an increased quota of supplies for its Toronto division, the controller, refusing the request, replied that allocations could not be made in this manner, but that every station operated by the company was prohibited from selling more than its particular quota. The orders which affected this aspect of the matter antedated order 010 and were not introduced in evidence, but the ruling made by the controller's letter of November 6, 1941 indi- cated the intention, at least from the standpoint of regulating supplies, of treating each filling station as a separate unit.\nThe matter is not to be determined, in my opinion, merely by deciding what was the intention of the controller. As Phipson (8th Ed. p. 97) puts it, in construing a written document, the question is not as to the meaning of the words alone, nor the meaning of the writer alone, but the meaning of the words as used by the writer. Some assistance is, I think to be obtained from other terms of the orders. Order 010 defined consumer as any person who acquires petroleum products for use only and not for the purposes of resale, and by paragraph 7 provided that the price to be paid by a consumer for graded motor fuel delivered by tank wagon should be one cent per gallon more than the dealers' tank wagon price applicable at the place of delivery. The price referred to was that in effect on September 30, 1941, and the place of delivery the consumer's premises. I think the same meaning is to be assigned to paragraph 9 of that order. The place referred to there was also, in my opinion, the place of delivery which, in the case of service stations selling gasoline, was their premises where delivery was made to the motor car of the consumer. To construe the order otherwise, as applied to the present case, would restrict dealers who delivered motor fuel to the premises of consumers to an increase of one cent over their price at such place on September 30, 1941, while permitting the appellant companies at their service stations to increase their prices for gasoline delivered to motor cars by 5.7 cents a gallon in Toronto and 3.7 cents a gallon in Montreal. While order 010 preceded P.C. 8527 by ten days and the latter order provided that the various provisions of its paragraph 3, which included the provision that for the purpose of the regulations each separate place of business of a seller should be deemed to be a separate seller, should not apply to any price fixed by some other authority with the written concurrence of the board, I think that the order, the preliminary statement of policy and the further statement of import policy may be considered as aids to the construction of order 010 as well as order 010A. The regula- tions which had been enacted provided for the closest liaison between the various controllers and the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, and the chairman of that board had concurred in the order and was thus aware of its terms. It must be assumed that the Wartime Prices and Trade Board was following a consistent policy with all sellers of goods and not favouring some vendors of gasoline over other retailers by permitting large increases in their maximum prices. The fact that it was made clear by P.C. 8527 and the subsequent statements that permitted increases were to be made on each individual seller's price during the basic period supports rather than detracts from the appellants' contention. That the matter was dealt with more specifically than had been done by order 010 does not alter my view as to the construction of the former document. It was not merely the appellants who construed the oil controller's order in this way; I think it was so construed by those directing the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. It is also significant, in my opinion, that on January 28, 1942, when the oil controller had before him P.C. 8527 and the declarations of policy of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, the expressions \"in any place\" and \"in such place\" were again used. I think if, at that time, there had been any intention to treat the matter of permitted increases in the price of oil on a different basis than all other commodities, the oil controller would have taken pains to see that the order said so in clear language.\nThe appellants in the present matter are not, in my opinion, in the same favourable position as the taxpayer in Pioneer Laundry and Dry Cleaners Ld. v. Minister of National Revenue 2, where there was a legal right to an allowance for depreciation. Here, I do not think the appellants have an enforceable right to a subsidy. I, however, consider that they are entitled in law to have their claims considered upon a proper basis. There has been here no exercise of discretion but merely a rejection of the claims based on a misconstruction of the orders of the oil controller. I would set aside the judgment appealed from and direct that the matter be referred back to the Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation to deal with the claims for subsidies advanced in this action, on the footing that the orders of the oil controller permitted the appellants to increase their prices only to the extent of one cent per gallon on September 30, 1941.\nI agree with the disposition of the costs proposed by my brother Rand.\nRand J.:\u2014This appeal concerns a claim made against the Crown for subsidies on gasoline imported from the United States between December 1, 1941 and July 1, 1942. The importers were companies which, at their own filling stations, sold directly to consumers in Toronto, Montreal and Windsor. They had, for some years, brought the gasoline in chiefly from Trinidad, and the retail price at which it was sold ranged between 2\u00bdc and 3\u00bdc a gallon under that of their competitors. Owing to the war, the supply from Trinidad was cut off, and they were forced to enter the higher price market of the United States.\nUnder The War Measures Act, Order-in-Council P.C. 1195 of February 19, 1941, amending a previous order of 1940, was issued dealing, among other things and subject to certain approvals, with petroleum products and empowering the oil controller,\nto fix or regulate the price or fix the maximum price or the minimum price at which oil may be sold or offered for sale in any place, area or zone by or to any person or class of persons and for such purpose to designate any such person or class of persons or any such place, area or zone;\nActing under that authority, the controller, by order No. 010 of October 21, 1941, fixed maximum prices at which oil products could be sold. Clauses 7 and 9 were as follows:\n7. Subject to paragraph 8 of this Order, the tank waggon price to be paid by a consumer for graded motor fuel delivered by tank-waggon shall be one cent per imperial gallon more than the dealer's tank-waggon price applicable at the place of delivery.\n9. From and after the date of this Order, the price to be paid for petroleum products, or any of them, by any purchaser thereof shall be regulated as follows:\n(a) The price to be paid in any place shall not exceed the maximum price at which any such petroleum product was sold or offered for sale in such place or for delivery to such place on the 30th day of September, 1941, plus any applicable price increase confirmed, authorized or required by this Order and having regard to the quantity purchased;\n(b) For the purposes of the foregoing clause (a) as applied to graded motor fuel, the maximum price applicable in any place on the 30th day of September, 1941, shall be ascertained having regard to the price of motor fuel having the same or the nearest qualities to those specified by Order 008A for either grade of graded motor fuel;\n(c) No greater price shall be charged to any person for petroleum products or any of them than that provided by paragraph 7 and by this paragraph 9 of this Order.\nAs of November 17, 1941, general price control was set up by Order-in-Council P.C. 8527 which excepted from its operation prices fixed by any federal agency and approved by the chairman of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board: within that exception were the maximum prices for petroleum products.\nOn December 2, 1941 and later, on January 1, 1942, the Prices Board issued statements of policy on matters arising out of the sale of imported goods for civilian purposes. The former laid down the general principle that imported goods would cost the importer no more than was appropriate to the retail ceiling prices, and declared that:\nImporters may, therefore, continue importing in the normal manner, with the assurance that appropriate subsidies will be provided with respect to goods imported on and after December 1, 1941, on the basis outlined below. The methods will, in the first instance, consist of direct subsidies to importers, with the possibility that from time to time duties and taxes on imported goods may be reduced in such a way as to make subsidies unnecessary.\nThe Board reserved the right to exclude any goods from the subsidy and \"to adjust the amount of that subsidy from time to time as may be fair and reasonable in the circumstances\". Consideration was to be given, however, to \"forward commitments\" entered into after the date mentioned. It was emphasized that the board would not approve subsidies where the increase in import prices was not of significant proportions for those concerned; that increases which the importer or his trade customers could absorb without \"undue hardship\" should not \"even\" be brought to the attention of the board. If, however, the increased cost was greater than could be expected to be absorbed, the board would set the subsidy at a reasonable level. It stated that if foreign suppliers should attempt to raise prices unduly, the subsidy might be withdrawn as to their goods.\nMore specifically it declared that the retailer who found his import prices to have risen \"significantly above the level which prevailed for goods sold by him during the basic period\" might submit a claim to the board, and that the board would endeavour to measure the subsidy in such a way that the retailer would \"receive his goods at a cost which is reasonable in relation to his retail ceiling price\". It was declared also to follow that \"those who maintained low retail prices during the basic period\" would be able to continue to sell at those prices without undue hardship. In some cases, it might be more suitable to adjust subsidy by reference to average costs of a number of retailers.\nFinally, importers were urged to have confidence \"that the board and the Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation (not at that time incorporated) will deal with individual problems fairly and reasonably. At the present time, however, the important thing is for import trade to be continued in accordance with past practice, even if present import prices involve an actual loss to the importers concerned, for subsidy adjustments will be made retroactive to December 1st. Importers should, therefore, adjust their own selling prices so as to enable retailers to carry on under the retail ceiling\". The statement of January 1, 1942, involved no change in principle but clarified and amended the earlier one in certain details. By it, also, certain goods previously eligible for subsidy were excluded. The trade was notified that no subsidies would be paid if similar goods were available in Canada at reasonable prices. It was stated that:\nNo definite rules can be laid down for raw materials, including fuel. Each commodity may require separate treatment on the position of the industry as a whole after intermediate selling prices of wholesalers, secondary manufacturers and primary manufacturers have been adjusted.\nOn December 17, 1941, Order-in-Council P.C. 9870 authorized the organization of a Crown company under the Companies Act to be known as \"Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation\" to be the agency for facilitating, under the direction of the Prices Board, price control generally, including the payment of subsidies, as part of the general price stabilizing policy. With this corporation, the Crown entered into an agreement by which accountable advances were to be made and by which the company was authorized in the discharge of such duties and responsibilities as might from time to time be delegated or committed to it to pay such sum or sums by way of subvention, subsidy, bonus or otherwise, to any person, firm or corporation as may be deemed advisable in accordance with the principles formulated from time to time by the Wartime Prices and Trade Board and approved by the Minister.\nSubsequently, on July 7, 1942, by Order in Council P.C. 5868, the corporation was authorized by section 1, ss. (2):\nto pay such sum or sums by way of subvention, subsidy, bonus or otherwise to any person, firm or corporation as may be deemed advisable; provided, however, that the said company shall not enter into any agreement binding itself to pay any such sum or sums to any person, firm or corporation except with the approval of the Minister of Finance.\nThe appellant companies continued to import gasoline from the United States during the period mentioned and submitted statements of costs and prices in support of an application for subsidy. It was declined on the ground that paragraph 9 of the controller's order 010 and paragraph 8 of the controller's order 010A established maximum prices applicable generally in geographical places; that the prices of the company's products as of September 30, 1941 were below the maximum prices in the three cities mentioned; and that they could have purchased gasoline in Canada at a price which would have enabled them to realize a reasonable profit within the maxima so prescribed. The companies, contending that their own highest prices had become fixed as maxima, laid their complaint before the Minister of Finance. His reply contains the following paragraph:\nThe question as to whether the Joy Companies are entitled to receive payment of a subsidy would appear to depend upon the interpretation of the word \"place\" as contained in the Orders above referred to. If, as you contend, this word means \"place of business\", your clients are entitled to payment of a subsidy. If, on the other hand, it means a geographical area, i.e. a municipality or adjacent district, they are not, since my advice is that no subsidy would have been required to enable your clients to sell gasoline at the maximum price permitted in the Montreal and Toronto areas.\nThe claims asserted in this proceeding are based on contract: they treat the statements of policy as contractual offers made by an authorized agency of the Crown and accepted by the action of the companies in continuing to import; and the letter of the Minister, as creating a contractual obligation conditional upon the interpretation of the language of the orders as meaning their individual selling stations. These contentions were rejected in the Exchequer Court 3, and I agree with that result. The short answer in each case is that neither the Board nor the Minister is shown to have evidenced the slightest intention of entering into contractual obligations or of establishing legal relations of any kind whatever. The language quoted from the declaration of policy shows that it was what it purported to be, a statement of general principles to be followed; and its qualifications and reservations and its references to modifications which would affect the amount or payment of subsidies demonstrate the purpose to perform the task of meeting price consequences of the emergency imposed by the government on the corporation by an administration of practical and fair measures carried out in good faith and according to the corporation's best judgment in the light of all the circumstances. It was this the Minister had in mind in his reference to the price maximum; but that he intended to take the matter out of its ordinary channels and place the issue of the subsidies as claimed on the interpretation of the clauses mentioned, is quite unwarranted. Conceding the interpretation to be as urged by the companies, many other factors would remain on which the decision of the corporation must be based, and there was neither intention nor authority in the Minister to supersede that jurisdiction.\nBut the interpretation adopted played a significant part in the rejection of the claim, and it must, I think, be examined. Admittedly the general price order fixed actual prices wherever they were being charged during the basic period, and expressly provided that each separate place of business should be deemed a separate seller or supplier. In a previous order of the oil controller, a quota had been placed on permissible sales which likewise applied to the individual place of sale such as, for example, a filling station. It is in part against this background that the orders of the oil controller should be viewed even though the first, 010, was issued prior to the general order. The Prices Board had been in existence since 1939 and as individual price controls were in substance merely particular cases of the general control, the companies were entitled to assume that the regulation of prices on petroleum was intended generally to be similar to that of the broader measure.\nIt is seen that the words \"place, area or zone\" in the authorizing regulation of P.C. 1195 apply to all goods placed under controllers. It is unquestionable that they were intended to meet the exigencies of widely differing commodities, and that they were not themselves to be used in the specification of a special order. It was meant that the controller could prescribe the maximum prices in relation to any particularly described \"place, area or zone\", not that these words themselves were to be put to such use. When, then, the word employed is so general as to fit many different particulars, we must have regard not only to the evidence of its meaning as afforded by other provisions of the order, but, as well, the fact that the order was to be read and interpreted by laymen as a practical business directive with the background of the general control; and that its interpretation must respect the meaning that could fairly and reasonably be given it by the trade, not something that lay hidden in the mind of the draftsman.\nOf the internal evidence in order 010, it will be noticed that paragraph 7, which I have quoted, provides that the tank-waggon price to be paid by a consumer shall be one cent a gallon more than the dealer's tank-waggon price \"applicable at the place of delivery.\" Now the place of delivery to a dealer is generally, or certainly includes, a filling station. It would be an extravagant use of business language to say that the place of delivery to a dealer at his filling station by tank-waggon was \"at Toronto\". It is a reasonable interpretation of that language that what is intended is the actual point of delivery, not some indefinite geographical area. There are hundreds of gasoline pumps set up near farm houses along the main highways all over the country which are supplied by tank-waggons; what could their \"places of delivery\" be except the farmer's yard? Then clause 10 provides a penalty for any person who sells petroleum products at a price greater \"than is authorized by this order as applicable at the place of delivery,\" i.e. to a dealer or a private consumer at a filling station. Clause 11 likewise refers to the authorized price \"at the place of delivery\". Clause 8(1) of order 010A refers to \"delivery to such place\" and clause 9, providing a penalty, contains the same language \"at the place of delivery\" as clause 10 of 010.\nAgainst this, the preposition \"in\" is urged as excluding the particular point of a sale or delivery, and no doubt it lends itself somewhat to that view. But there are other considerations to which that circumstance leads. In Toronto the appellants have 16 service stations. The larger oil companies do not themselves sell to the retail trade, and the retail prices are fixed by the proprietors of the individual stations. There is no evidence that a uniform price is maintained throughout the city even of the gasoline supplied by any one of the large refiners, yet the order, on the interpretation given by the corporation, would fix as a maximum retail price the highest charged by any service station in the city on September 30, 1941. This, ordinarily superseded by competition, might easily be material in the presence of quotas and short supply.\nThe price, not only of retail but of tank-waggon and rail or water delivery in tank quantities, was also envisaged, and it is obvious that if the appellants were compelled to purchase in Canada, they would purchase on a large scale basis. What were the means open to them to determine the maximum wholesale price, say, in Toronto? They had none themselves of ascertaining it, and their competitive relation may be assumed to have been such as was not conducive to exchanges. Not being refiners, they would have to submit themselves to their competitors and as their purchases would call for greater importation of crude oil, the only difference in the international aspect would be the addition to the monetary exchange of the cost of refining in the United States; but however repugnant all this might have been, if the circumstances were such as to make the necessity clear, they would have had to submit to it.\nThese considerations, in the setting of the total control and the generality of the language used, justified the companies in concluding that the maximum price was intended to be that of the individual place of sale or delivery. But even if that had not been so, the restriction to that at which the product was sold, say, \"in\" Toronto, implied, as sold by the applicant for subsidy. He would know only his own maximum price and, at the most, some of those publicly advertised. In the large centres, the maximum geographically could have been ascertained and announced by the controller rather than to have had it disclosed at a trial by private witnesses after the event; and it would have been out of the ordinary course of public regulation to charge the applicant with responsibility for discovering business facts of his competitors.\nThe final question is whether, under the terms of the various orders, these appellants have acquired any right which can be recognized as of a juridical nature. I think it indisputable that keeping in mind the broad discretionary authority vested in the corporation, the times, the unprecedented control of business, the absolute necessity for fair, equal and impartial treatment in matters so immediately affecting the fortunes of individuals, a duty arose to enter upon the adjudication of a claim for subsidy in good faith and upon the basis of its relevant considerations. That their range would be spacious does not convert the power into a privilege of acting or not acting at pleasure: Julius v. Bishop of Oxford 4.\nThat duty has its correlative right in the individual. In adjudicating, the corporation must proceed within and on proper interpretations of the administrative legislation, and where, as here, it has misconstrued a material provision, its adjudication is vitiated and its conclusion nullified.\nThe appeals should therefore be allowed and the matters referred back to the government to pass upon the applications in the light of the interpretation given to the order and all other proper circumstances.\nIn view of the fact that this declaratory relief was not asked for and the claims as submitted must be rejected, the appellants should recover one-third of their costs in both courts.\nEstey J.:\u2014The appellants, incorporated in 1934, imported gasoline from Trinidad and sold it to consumers at a price lower than that of their competitors. After the outbreak of war, and because of the scarcity of shipping facilities, they were forced to discontinue importation from Trinidad, but did so from the United States, where prices were so much higher as, in their opinion, to justify an application to the Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation Ltd. for a subsidy covering the period between December 1, 1941, and July 1, 1942. The amount claimed was $459,845.73, with interest from September 15, 1942.\nWhile the appellants are two separate companies, one carrying on business in the province of Quebec and the other in the province of Ontario, the issues raised are identical and for convenience only the claim of the Joy Oil Company Limited, arising out of its Toronto business, will be discussed. In Toronto it operates a marine terminal and sixteen service stations.\nThe Joy Oil Company Limited based its claim for a subsidy upon three statements issued by the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, which they construe as an offer to pay a subsidy accepted by them in continuing to import gasoline and sell it at the price fixed by either the oil controller or the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. They contend that in this way a contract was made which was ratified by the Minister of Finance in his letter to the solicitors for the suppliants dated March 11, 1943.\nThe first of these statements was issued on November 21, 1941, entitled \"Preliminary Statement of Policy\", the second, December 2, 1941, entitled \"Import Policy\", and the third, dated January 1, 1942, entitled \"Statement on Import Policy.\" These are lengthy statements and need not here be reproduced. It is sufficient to observe that they are written in neither the language of an offer nor that of orders or documents purporting to create rights. They are rather statements of policy, introducing price control, giving the reasons that made it necessary, and an explanation of how it would be carried out. They also constitute an appeal that because of the necessity for, the magnitude of and the difficulty involved in price control, it could only be successful if all co-operated. Throughout it is clear that these documents are related to others. This appears from the opening paragraph of the first statement:\nOn December 1, 1941, there will come into force in Canada a complete control of all prices. Higher prices will not be permitted than those at which goods were actually sold during the four weeks September 15 to October 11. This far-reaching action will affect everyone. It is in the common interest of all. It has an essential part to play in the successful carrying on of the war. They specifically make reference to importers, and the language, rather than constituting an offer, indicates that the importer who follows the outline contained in these statements of policy will be dealt with \"fairly and reasonably.\" This is particuarly evident in para. 9 of the statement of December 2, 1941, which reads, in part:\n9. The above represents the most comprehensive general statement which can be made. Importers are urged to have confidence that the Board and the Commodity Price Stabilization Corporation will deal with individual problems fairly and reasonably * * *\nA reading of these statements leads to the conclusion that subsidies were to be paid, not on the basis of a contract, but upon the basis of a fair and reasonable consideration of each application made therefor.\nThe contention that the letter of the Minister of Finance dated March 11, 1943, constituted a ratification cannot be maintained. Under the authority hereinafter quoted (Order-in-Council P.C. 9870) the Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation Ltd. could agree to pay only such sums by way of subsidies as it \"deemed advisable\" and even then the agreement was not binding \"except with the approval of the Minister of Finance.\" The corporation had refused the subsidy and, therefore, there was no proposed agreement that could be approved. The letter was an answer to a complaint suggesting that the appellants had been discriminated against which, in effect, asked that their application receive fair and equitable treatment. The Minister reviewed the facts, particularly the opinion received by the corporation relative to the word \"place,\" and concluded that he could not \"interfere with the decision of the Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation that your clients are not entitled to payment of the subsidy claimed.\" In these circumstances, even if the authority to approve could be construed to include that to ratify, the Minister did not purport either to approve or to ratify, nor, indeed, was there any agreement which he could approve or ratify.\nIt is necessary, therefore, to determine whether the appellant is entitled to a subsidy apart from any question of contract. These statements must be read and construed with the Orders-in-Council already passed relative to the creation of (September 3, 1939) and the powers conferred upon the Wartime Prices and Trade Board; to the appointment of (June 28, 1940) and the powers conferred on the oil controller and his order 010, October 21, 1941; to the creation of (June 24, 1940) and powers conferred upon the Wartime Industries Control Board; as well as the steps taken by these respective bodies relative to a fixing of prices and, in particular, with respect to gasoline. That these respective bodies were duly created and vested with all the powers they have exercised in relation to this litigation, as well as the fact that their efforts were coordinated and at all relevant times they were acting in concert, is clearly established. It is unnecessary to examine in detail the origin, powers and purposes of these bodies, except to emphasize that they were engaged in the regulation and control of essential commodities and the fixing of maximum and minimum prices with regard thereto.\nThe appellant made its application to the Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation Ltd. This corporation was incorporated \"with the intent and for the purpose of facilitating, under the direction of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, the control of prices of goods, wares and merchandise in Canada, and with such powers, in addition to those conferred by the Companies Act, as may be set forth in the Letters' Patent\" (Order-in-Council P.C. 9870, December 17, 1941). Letters Patent were issued on the 24th day of December, 1941, and expressly provided for the payment of such subsidies \"as the company may deem fit and proper.\" The foregoing Order-in-Council P.C. 9870 was subsequently amended on July 7, 1942, by Order-in-Council P.C. 5863, to provide that the company should pay only\nsuch sum or sums by way of * * * subsidy, * * * as may be deemed advisable; * * *\nsubject, however, to a further provision\nthat the said Company shall not enter into any agreement binding itself to pay any such sum or sums to any person, firm or corporation except with the approval of the Minister of Finance.\nThe corporation, under date of July 14, 1942, refused the appellant's application for a subsidy on the basis that gasoline was available in Canada and, therefore, the provisions of para. 4(c) of the \"Statement on Import Policy\", dated January 1, 1942, prohibited the payment of a subsidy. 4. Importers should observe the following points. in connection with goods eligible for subsidy:\n* * *\n(c) * * * No subsidies will be paid if similar goods are available in Canada at reasonable prices.\nIn its letter refusing payment of a subsidy the corporation pointed out that the oil controller's order 010 (October 21, 1941) established maximum prices as of October 1, 1941, for gasoline which at Toronto, for the grade (Grade 2) here in question, was 32.5c per gallon, and that gasoline was available in Toronto which, when sold at 32.5c per gallon, would give to the retailer a spread of 4c to 5.5c per gallon, depending upon whether it was purchased on the basis of tank wagon or tank car. It was also pointed out that quantity buyers might obtain jobber's prices which would provide an even greater spread. In fact, throughout the negotiations that followed, the corporation took the position that it was open to the appellant to increase its retail price of 27 \u2022 8c to the ceiling of 32 \u2022 5c and to purchase gasoline on the same basis as other distributors, while the appellant maintained it was not permitted to increase its price above 27.8c per gallon. It was at this price that it was selling gasoline on October 1, 1941, the effective date of the price under oil controller's order 010, and also the price at which it was selling gasoline in the basic period September 15 to October 11 as fixed by Order-in-Council P.C. 8527 dated November 1, 1941, which provided:\nThe maximum price at which any person may sell or supply any goods or services shall be the highest lawful price at which such person sold or supplied goods or services of the same kind and quality during\nthe period September 15, 1941, to October 11, 1941. The appellant contends that its price of 27.8c per gallon was fixed, whether the matter be dealt with under the oil controller's order 010 or under Order-in-Council P.C. 8527. It is conceded that, if the latter applies, the price was so fixed. It is, however, contended that it does not apply because in para. 4(g) of the latter (Order-in-Council P.C. 8527) it is provided:\n4. The provisions of section 3 (price fixing) of these regulations shall not apply with respect to:\n* * *\n(g) any price fixed by the Board, or fixed or approved by any other federal, provincial or other authority with the written concurrence of the Board. It is established that oil controller's order 010 was issued prior thereto with the concurrence of the board. The question, therefore, arises particularly under oil controller's order 010. Item No. 9 of this order reads, in part, as follows:\n9. From and after the date of this Order, the price to be paid for petroleum products, or any of them, by any purchaser thereof shall be regulated as follows:\n(a) The price to be paid in any place shall not exceed the maximum price at which any such petroleum product was sold or offered for sale in such place or for delivery to such place on the 30th day of September, 1941, plus any applicable price increase confirmed, * * *\nand Item No. 10 thereof, in part, as follows:\n10. Any person who sells petroleum products, or any of them, at a price greater than is authorized by this Order as applicable at the place of delivery thereof shall be guilty of a breach of this Order * * *\nThe corporation's contention is that under oil controller's order 010 prices were \"set for gasoline on a geographical basis and not on an individual basis,\" and, therefore, the word \"place\" in the foregoing Item No. 9(a) should be construed to refer and be applicable to all service stations in Toronto and not to the individual service stations. This construction, if accepted, permitted the appellant to raise its price to 32.5c per gallon at its service stations in Toronto.\nThe word \"place\" is not defined in order 010, nor is it defined in any other of the oil controller's orders. Not only does the oil controller not define the word \"place,\" but he never did fix any \"place, area or zone\" within which a particular price would obtain. The oil controller was a member of the Wartime Industries Control Board, which was created, inter alia, in order that the controllers \"should act in respect to common problems along similar lines\" (Order-in-Council P.C. 2715, June 24, 1940); and then by a further Order-in-Council (P.C. 6835, August 29, 1941) another step was taken to\nfurther measures to promote co-ordination and integration of the functions and activities of such Controllers, * * * by creating a closer relationship between the Controllers, the Wartime Industries Control Board and the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, to promote co-operation * * * and reduce the possibility of any confusion arising as a result of the exercise and discharge of their various powers, functions and duties.\nP.C. 6835 was one of the Orders-in-Council under which the oil controller issued his order 010. In these circumstances it is significant that The Maximum Prices Regulations, as fixed by Order-in-Council P.C. 8527, November 1, 1941, provided in sec. 3, subsection (7):\n3. (7) For the purposes of these regulations, each separate place of business of a seller or supplier shall be deemed to be a separate seller or supplier.\nThe first of the three above-mentioned statements included:\nThe price ceiling applies to each individual store, department or branch on the basis of its own prices for each separate kind and quality of goods and services during the basic period. The lower-price stores are not permitted to raise their prices to the level of the higher-price stores.\nIt is also significant that the corporation, in refusing the appellant's request for the allotment of a larger quota, stated:\nIf any station operated by your Company is permitted to sell more gasoline than the quota applicable to such station, the result is clearly a breach of the order.\nMoreover, provision 8(1) of Order-in-Council P.C. 6835, under which the oil controller issued his order 010, repealed the oil controller's original authority in this regard, as contained in Order-in-Council P.C. 1195. In the latter in particular the word \"place\" appears several times and sometimes clearly means an individual place of business. Indeed, in reading the order as a whole, it is quite open to the construction that the word \"place\" throughout has that meaning. It will be further observed that in issuing order 010 the oil controller used the word \"place\" only and not the phrase \"place, area or zone,\" as those words appear in para. 8(1) of Order-in-Council P.C. 6835.\nThis order 010 was issued October 21, 1941, before any of the three statements above referred to. On January 28, 1942, after these statements were issued, as well as Order-in-Council P.C. 8527, all making it clear that prices generally were fixed in relation to the individual store or place of business, the oil controller amended his order 010 by his further order 010A, and even then did not define the word \"place\" to mean, in effect, an area or zone as he now contends. It would seem that if he intended the word \"place\", in his order, to have a meaning different from that which obtained otherwise throughout price control that he would at least have made it clear in order 010A. Throughout it is obvious that it was the intent and purpose of the Governor in Council that the provisions respecting price fixing should be read and construed together and that all bodies engaged in administering price control should act together and in concert. It follows that the word \"place\" ought to be construed as having the same meaning throughout, unless in a particular order it is used in a context which shows some other meaning was intended. Such is not found in Orders-in-Council P.C. 1195 and P.C. 6835, nor is it found in oil controller's order 010, and, therefore, the word \"place,\" as used therein, should be construed to mean the individual service station. The appellant, therefore, could not raise its retail prices to 32.5c per gallon and gasoline was not \"available in Canada at reasonable prices\" within the meaning of para. 4(c) above quoted.\nThe respondents contended that as the corporation was authorized to pay such subsidy \"as the company may deem fit and proper\" and then only \"with the approval of the Minister of Finance,\" its decision was the exercise of an \"administrative discretion\" over which there was no control other than that it \"shall be in accordance with principles formulated from time to time by the Wartime Prices and Trade Board and approved by the Minister.\" The difficulty in applying the authorities cited by the respondents in support of the view that the exercise of such a discretion is not reviewable by a court is that here the company, upon the evidence, did not exercise a discretion, but rather acted upon its construction of the above para. 4(c). The construction of such a provision is a matter of law and not the exercise of a discretion.\nOil controller's order 010 does not deal with importation of gasoline. That was otherwise dealt with. In addition to para. 9, already quoted, of the statement of December 2, 1941, it contained this specific reference:\nImported fuel\u2014Coal, coke, petroleum and its products, will be dealt with on much the same basis as raw materials if circumstances so require.\nIndeed, throughout it is not contested but that it was intended those carrying on business would continue to do so and that if it were necessary for them to import merchandise and to pay higher prices therefor an application for a subsidy would be considered. Gasoline was not available to the appellant in Canada at a reasonable price that would permit of its carrying on business and selling its gasoline at the price fixed by the oil controller at 27.8c per gallon.\nThe appellant's application was only considered upon the basis that gasoline was available to it in Canada at reasonable prices. Under these circumstances it would appear that the appellant is entitled to have its application further considered. The matter should be referred back on the basis suggested by my brother Locke and adopted by the Chief Justice and the costs disposed of as my brother Rand suggests.\nThe appeal is allowed and the matter referred back to the Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation to deal with the claims for subsidies advanced in this action on the footing that the orders of the oil controller permitted the appellants to increase their prices only to the extent of one cent per gallon on Sept. 30, 1941. In view of the fact that this declaratory relief was not asked for and the claims as submitted must be rejected, the appellants will recover one third of their costs in both Courts.\nSolicitor for the Appellants: E.

A willing buyer, the respondent, was found but the appellant refused to sign the deed tendered. An action en passation de titre was brought and was maintained by the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal with certain modifications to the contract, which had been produced with the action and which had been signed by the respondent. In 1944, following the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the appellant signed the contract which retained the original provision that the purchaser would be entitled to possession ninety days after the signature of the deed. The appellant kept possession up to the expiration of the ninety days following his signature as vendor and then claimed and received all the monthly instalments alleged to be due since 1942. The respondent, by the present action, sought to recover the civil fruits of the property as from the date of his own signature as purchaser in 1942. The action was maintained by the Superior Court and by a majority in the Court of Appeal.\nHeld (The Chief Justice and Rand J. dissenting), that by virtue of Art. 1472 C.C. the sale was made perfect in the year 1942 by the acceptance of the offer of sale; delivery of the property was not needed to complete the sale since what was alienated was a thing certain and determinate (Art. 1025 C.C.). The judgment of the Court of Appeal in 1944 did not have the effect of creating new rights but rather to declare the pre-existing rights of the parties as of 1942. Therefore, as the respondent had had the ownership of the property since 1942, he was entitled to the civil fruits from that date by virtue of Arts. 1498 and 409 C.C., and the appellant could not be considered a possessor in good faith within the terms of Art. 411 C.C.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming, Marchand J.A. dissenting, the judgment of the Superior Court which had maintained respondent's claim for the civil fruits of a property sold to him by the appellant. E. Masson, K.C. for the appellant.\nRoland Fradette, K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting): L'intim\u00e9 a poursuivi l'appelant pour lui r\u00e9clamer la valeur des fruits civils d'une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re situ\u00e9e sur la rue Saint-Dominique, \u00e0 Jonqui\u00e8re, et il a obtenu de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure un jugement lui octroyant une somme de $6,714.37, avec int\u00e9r\u00eats et d\u00e9pens, comme repr\u00e9sentant le montant de sa r\u00e9clamation. La Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) 2, a confirm\u00e9 ce jugement, M. le juge Marchand dissident. Ces deux jugements nous sont maintenant soumis et il s'agit pour cette Cour de d\u00e9cider s'ils doivent \u00eatre maintenus.\nCette d\u00e9cision d\u00e9pend, \u00e0 mon humble point de vue, exclusivement de l'interpr\u00e9tation d'un contrat de vente, en date du 26 octobre 1944, par lequel l'appelant transmet \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 le titre \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dont il s'agit.\nLa signature de ce contrat s'est faite dans des circonstances assez compliqu\u00e9es et n\u00e9cessita un jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, en date du 9 d\u00e9cembre 1943, puis un jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel), en date du 17 juin 1944.\nCe qui donna lieu \u00e0 ces deux jugements successifs, c'est que l'appelant avait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 un agent d'immeubles, du nom de J.-E. Bergeron, une procuration, en date du 7 juillet 1942, par laquelle il chargeait Bergeron de vendre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question. Bergeron trouva un acheteur dans la personne de l'intim\u00e9. En vertu de la procuration, l'appelant s'engageait \"\u00e0 donner un titre r\u00e9gulier\" \u00e0 la personne qui accepterait les conditions mentionn\u00e9es dans la procuration.\nPrenons pour acquis que l'appelant se montra dilatoire pour consentir ce \"titre r\u00e9gulier\", et l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9senta donc \u00e0 l'appelant un projet d'acte de vente par l'entremise du notaire Brown, qui mit l'appelant en demeure de signer ce projet d'acte.\nTel que pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, ce projet portait la date du 6 ao\u00fbt 1942. L'appelant refusa de le signer dans les termes o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait \u00e9crit. Il s'ensuivit une action en passation de titre. M. le juge P.-E. C\u00f4t\u00e9, saisi de la cause, arriva \u00e0 la conclusion que le projet d'acte n'\u00e9tait pas conforme \u00e0 la procuration que l'appelant avait donn\u00e9e \u00e0 Bergeron et il y ordonna certaines corrections indiqu\u00e9es au jugement qu'il pronon\u00e7a alors, en ajoutant que, si le projet ainsi corrig\u00e9 \u00e9tait compl\u00e9t\u00e9 par les parties, il constituerait le contrat qui devait les lier, mais que, si l'une ou l'autre des parties se refusait \u00e0 signer l'acte ainsi corrig\u00e9 par lui, le jugement \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 titre en faveur de l'intim\u00e9 et en aurait tous les effets l\u00e9gaux.\nCe jugement ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 en appel, la Cour du Banc du Roi ordonna encore d'autres corrections au projet d'acte offert par l'intim\u00e9, pronon\u00e7a que ce projet, ainsi corrig\u00e9, vaudrait comme s'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 tel quel par l'intim\u00e9 et condamna l'appelant \u00e0 signer l'acte de vente, ainsi corrig\u00e9, dans un d\u00e9lai de quinze jours de la signification du jugement, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi \u00e9quivaudrait \"\u00e0 un titre de vente en faveur de l'intim\u00e9 aux conditions de l'acte de vente ainsi corrig\u00e9\".\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi, en cons\u00e9quence, maintint l'appel du pr\u00e9sent appelant, avec d\u00e9pens, contre l'intim\u00e9, tout en ordonnant que, en premi\u00e8re instance, chaque partie supporterait chacune ses frais.\nSuivant moi, pour les fins du jugement que nous avons maintenant \u00e0 rendre, l'un des consid\u00e9rants du jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, lors de ce premier litige, entre les parties, doit recevoir une attention particuli\u00e8re. Il se lit comme suit:\nCONSIDERANT alors que la preuve d\u00e9montrant sans place pour aucun doute que par un jugement maintenant l'intim\u00e9 dans son action et condamnant l'appelant \u00e0 signer l'acte offert, tel que modifi\u00e9 pour le rendre conforme aux conventions intervenues entre les parties, elles seront r\u00e9gl\u00e9es comme elles doivent l'\u00eatre; qu'il y a lieu cependant en accordant \u00e0 l'appelant ses frais \u00e0 l'appel de lui refuser ses frais de d\u00e9fense et de refuser pareillement \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 ses frais d'action, les parties n'\u00e9tant r\u00e9gl\u00e9es que par le pr\u00e9sent jugement.\nLes deux passages suivants de ce consid\u00e9rant sont \u00e0 noter: \"\u2026 elles seront r\u00e9gl\u00e9es comme elles doivent l'\u00eatre\" et \"les parties n'\u00e9tant r\u00e9gl\u00e9es que par le pr\u00e9sent jugement\". Ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par M. le juge Marchand et il n'est pas sans signification que le m\u00eame juge, dans l'appel qui nous est soumis, ait exprim\u00e9 sa dissidence de la d\u00e9cision de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi. Je dois dire imm\u00e9diatement que je partage l'avis que contient cette dissidence.\nCe ne sont plus, en effet, les jugements de l'honorable juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 et de la Cour du Banc du Roi sur le premier litige qu'il s'agit d'interpr\u00e9ter et qui r\u00e8glent les relations des parties qui sont actuellement devant nous. C'est le contrat qu'elles ont sign\u00e9; non seulement parce que ses termes en ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9s en dernier ressort par la Cour du Banc du Roi, le 17 juin 1944, et qu'il est pass\u00e9 en force de chose jug\u00e9e, mais c'est v\u00e9ritablement le contrat lui-m\u00eame que l'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 signer par ce premier jugement de la Cour d'Appel, auquel les parties se sont conform\u00e9es, comme d'ailleurs elles y \u00e9taient tenues, dont elles ont accept\u00e9 les termes et auxquels, de part et d'autre, elles ont acquiesc\u00e9.\nC'est ce contrat qui doit r\u00e9gir leurs relations et que nous sommes tenus d'appliquer \u00e0 l'action pour paiement des fruits civils que l'intim\u00e9 a intent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelant.\nComme le fait remarquer M. le Juge Marchand dans ses notes sur le pr\u00e9sent appel, l'intim\u00e9 \"s'est soumis \u00e0 accepter les corrections qui pourraient \u00eatre faites par la Cour \u00e0 l'acte qu'il demandait d'imposer \u00e0 l'appelant\" et \"les renvois \u00e0 la marge constatant les modifications par les deux jugements, celui de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et celui de la Cour du Banc du Roi, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 initial\u00e9s le m\u00eame jour (i.e. le jour de la signature du contrat) par les deux parties\". Jusqu'\u00e0 la signature du contrat, ainsi que le fait remarquer le juge dissident, \"l'appelant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en demeure l\u00e9galement de signer l'acte de vente pr\u00e9par\u00e9 et offert par l'intim\u00e9, puisque la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure d'abord, la Cour du Banc du Roi ensuite, ont d\u00fb corriger cet acte pour qu'il contienne les vraies conventions et obligations des parties \u2026 quant aux corrections, il (l'intim\u00e9) les a accept\u00e9es d'avance, et apr\u00e8s qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, les a accept\u00e9es encore\".\n\"Enfin, et \u00e0 moins de contredire la pr\u00e9somption irr\u00e9fragable de la res judicata, il y a \u00e9vidence que le contrat tel que sign\u00e9 par les parties contient toutes leurs conventions, constate et les lie \u00e0 toutes leurs obligations r\u00e9ciproques et \u00e0 toutes les modalit\u00e9s de leur ex\u00e9cution\". Et l'intim\u00e9 n'a pu acqu\u00e9rir \"d'autres droits que ceux que la signature de l'appelant lui a reconnus\".\nOr, la premi\u00e8re \u00e9nonciation authentique certaine de ce contrat ainsi d\u00e9finitivement r\u00e9gl\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel, c'est qu'il est fait l'an mil neuf cent quarante-quatre le vingt-sixi\u00e8me jour du mois d'octobre. Cette date \"du 26 octobre 1944\" a \u00e9t\u00e9 alors accept\u00e9e par la comparution de l'intim\u00e9 et les initiales qu'il a appos\u00e9es aux renvois.\nLa premi\u00e8re d\u00e9claration que l'on trouve dans ce contrat, c'est que le vendeur (l'appelant) \"d\u00e9clare vendre par ces pr\u00e9sentes,\u2026 \u00e0 l'acqu\u00e9reur (l'intim\u00e9) qui accepte, savoir:\" (l'immeuble en question en cette cause).\nDe m\u00eame que l'honorable juge Marchand, je ne puis voir comment l'une ou l'autre des parties, quels que soient les faits qui sont intervenus avant ou depuis, puisse \u00eatre re\u00e7ue \u00e0 dire aujourd'hui que ce n'est pas \u00e0 cette date du 26 octobre 1944 (\"par ces pr\u00e9sentes\"), \"qu'une convention de vendre d'une part, d'acheter de l'autre part, un contrat de vente, le seul existant, a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue entre elles. C'est \u00e0 cette date, ce jour seulement, que l'appelant a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de son immeuble \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 qui en est devenu alors seulement propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 son tour\".\nLe contrat fait la loi entre les parties, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne contienne des clauses ill\u00e9gales, ou contraires aux bonnes m\u0153urs ou \u00e0 l'ordre public. Sans doute, la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (C.C. article 1472) est que la vente est parfaite par le seul consentement des parties; mais il n'est pas ill\u00e9gal, ni contraire aux bonnes m\u0153urs ou \u00e0 l'ordre public, que les parties conviennent que la vente ne sera parfaite qu'\u00e0 partir de la signature, de part et d'autre, d'un contrat en bonne et due forme.\nOr, toutes les circonstances ici d\u00e9montrent qu'il n'y a eu v\u00e9ritablement consentement des parties que le jour o\u00f9 elles ont sign\u00e9 le contrat, le 26 octobre 1944.\nLa procuration \u00e0 Bergeron comportait, de la part de l'appelant, l'engagement \"\u00e0 donner un titre r\u00e9gulier\". Il n'y avait donc pas consentement complet jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la convention, quelle qu'elle fut, fut consign\u00e9e dans un acte r\u00e9gulier.\nIl est \u00e0 remarquer que le prot\u00eat signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant par le notaire Brown et le sommant de signer le projet d'acte de vente qui lui fut soumis en m\u00eame temps a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e0 la r\u00e9quisition de l'intim\u00e9 Tremblay et de l'agent d'immeubles Bergeron, mandataire de l'appelant Zusman. Dans ce prot\u00eat, la qualit\u00e9 prise par l'intim\u00e9 Tremblay est seulement celle de \"promettant-acheteur\" de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il ne se consid\u00e9rait pas, d\u00e8s lors, comme \u00e9tant devenu propri\u00e9taire par le fait que, comme il le pr\u00e9tend maintenant, il aurait, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but, donn\u00e9 son consentement \u00e0 la vente. En plus, le fait m\u00eame que l'intim\u00e9 et l'agent se sont joints dans ce prot\u00eat pour soumettre \u00e0 l'appelant le projet d'acte de vente qui l'accompagnait, conduit n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 la conclusion que le projet d'acte contenait toutes les conventions et les seules conventions que l'intim\u00e9 avait accept\u00e9es. Or, successivement, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure (l'honorable juge C\u00f4t\u00e9) et la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 cat\u00e9goriquement que ce projet, ainsi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, ne contenait pas des conventions conformes \u00e0 celles qui \u00e9taient stipul\u00e9es et sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9es par l'appelant dans la procuration qu'il avait donn\u00e9e \u00e0 Bergeron.\nOn ne peut donc pas dire que le consentement des parties s'\u00e9tait rencontr\u00e9 d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but puisque, au contraire, les deux Cours ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que ce consentement int\u00e9gral n'existait pas.\nPour r\u00e9p\u00e9ter de nouveau le consid\u00e9rant m\u00eame de la Cour du Banc du Roi sur le premier litige, ce n'est que par ce jugement de la Cour d'Appel, rendu le 17 juin 1944, que \"les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es\". En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, je l'admets, le jugement final qui est prononc\u00e9 dans une cause a un effet r\u00e9troactif \u00e0 la date, ou bien o\u00f9 l'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue, ou bien m\u00eame, dans certains cas, \u00e0 la date des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui y ont donn\u00e9 lieu. Mais on ne peut reconna\u00eetre un effet r\u00e9troactif aux jugements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus, lorsque la Cour a condamn\u00e9 l'appelant \u00e0 signer le contrat de vente, tel qu'elle l'a corrig\u00e9, si le jugement lui-m\u00eame d\u00e9clare que les parties n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es que par ce jugement et que l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer les frais des proc\u00e9dures devant la Cour d'Appel.\nSi, au d\u00e9but, le projet de vente propos\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas conforme \u00e0 la procuration donn\u00e9e par l'appelant \u00e0 Bergeron, au point que ce projet a d\u00fb \u00eatre amend\u00e9 par les deux Cours, il est impossible de dire que pareils jugements puissent r\u00e9troagir. La v\u00e9ritable position des parties n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie que le jour du jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi et ce n'est qu'\u00e0 partir de ce moment-l\u00e0 que l'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vis de l'intim\u00e9, suivant les termes qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter et qui n'\u00e9taient pas ceux que lui avait propos\u00e9s l'intim\u00e9.\nJe ne puis donc admettre que, en l'esp\u00e8ce, l'on doit consid\u00e9rer le premier jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi comme ayant un effet r\u00e9troactif. Il a reconnu, au contraire, que la position prise par l'intim\u00e9, lors de son action en passation de titre, n'\u00e9tait pas celle que l'appelant \u00e9tait tenu de reconna\u00eetre, et que la v\u00e9ritable situation n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 \"r\u00e9gl\u00e9e\" entre les parties que le jour m\u00eame du jugement. Puis, reprenant ce que j'ai dit au d\u00e9but de mes notes, ce jugement ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 par les parties, \u00e9tant devenu entre elles chose jug\u00e9e et le contrat qui devait v\u00e9ritablement r\u00e9gir leurs relations de vendeur et d'acheteur \u00e9tant celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par ce jugement, c'est lui et lui seul qui doit maintenant \u00eatre oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'action intent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 en recouvrement des fruits civils.\nPartant de l\u00e0, ce contrat ne pr\u00e9sente aucune difficult\u00e9 d'interpr\u00e9tation, ni aucune ambiguit\u00e9. Il porte la signature de l'intim\u00e9 et il lie ce dernier. Il d\u00e9clare que la vente a pris effet \"par ces pr\u00e9sentes\". Cela veut dire \u00e9videmment le 26 octobre 1944, date que porte le contrat. C'est donc ce jour-l\u00e0 que le consentement des parties s'est rencontr\u00e9 et que la vente a pris effet en vertu m\u00eame de l'article 1472 du Code Civil. Et, d\u00e8s que l'on admet cette proposition, la cause ne pr\u00e9sente plus la moindre difficult\u00e9. Cette date-l\u00e0 m\u00eame a \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 dans l'ex\u00e9cution du contrat, puisque sa prise de possession n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par lui que dans les \"quatre-vingt-dix jours apr\u00e8s la signature des pr\u00e9sentes\", tel que le contrat le comportait. S'il fallait donner effet \u00e0 sa pr\u00e9sente pr\u00e9tention, il aurait d\u00fb r\u00e9clamer la possession d\u00e8s le jour de la signature du contrat, car alors les 90 jours, \u00e0 compter de la date qu'il a voulu imposer dans son action (le 6 juillet 1942), \u00e9taient depuis longtemps expir\u00e9s.\nIl essaie de faire une comparaison entre la r\u00e9clamation de l'appelant pour le paiement de la somme de cent dollars par mois, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat, \u00e0 compter du 6 septembre 1942, et le fait que lui-m\u00eame ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficierait pas de la m\u00eame date pour le point de d\u00e9part du droit aux fruits civils de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue. Je suis incapable de voir quel avantage il peut tirer de cette comparaison puisque le paiement des mensualit\u00e9s que lui a r\u00e9clam\u00e9es l'appelant est stipul\u00e9 dans le contrat lui-m\u00eame comme devenant d\u00fb et exigible \u00e0 partir du 6 septembre 1942 et \"ainsi de suite le sixi\u00e8me du jour de chaque mois subs\u00e9quent pour jusqu'\u00e0 parfait paiement\".\nJe n'ai pas \u00e0 me demander si la Cour d'Appel, en condamnant l'appelant \u00e0 signer le contrat tel qu'il se lit, a commis une erreur ou a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'une distraction et si elle n'aurait pas d\u00fb ordonner que la date du 6 septembre 1942 fut modifi\u00e9e. Je constate simplement qu'elle ne l'a pas fait et que ce que l'appelant a exig\u00e9 de ce chef est strictement conforme aux termes m\u00eames du contrat. Il n'y a rien d'ill\u00e9gal ou de contraire aux bonnes m\u0153urs ou \u00e0 l'ordre public qu'un vendeur et un acheteur conviennent que le paiement du prix d'une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 devra compter d'une date ant\u00e9rieure au contrat. Cela peut \u00eatre une convention inusit\u00e9e mais, du moment que les parties sont d'accord, il n'y a rien en soi qui puisse permettre aux tribunaux de refuser d'en tenir compte.\nPar contre, les seuls \u00e9l\u00e9ments du contrat qui nous permettent de d\u00e9cider \u00e0 quel moment l'appelant a cess\u00e9 de poss\u00e9der les droits du propri\u00e9taire sont la d\u00e9claration que la vente s'est effectu\u00e9e \"par ces pr\u00e9sentes\" et donc le 26 octobre 1944. Jusque l\u00e0, rien ne permet de conclure que la vente remonte \u00e0 une date ant\u00e9rieure et qu'un consentement identique de part et d'autre aurait eu pour effet de la rendre parfaite. L'appelant avait mentionn\u00e9 dans sa procuration qu'il faudrait \"un titre r\u00e9gulier\" et ce titre n'a exist\u00e9 que le 26 octobre 1944. La clause qui traite de la prise de possession vient encore confirmer cette situation, puisque, de part et d'autre, on a bien compris que cette prise de possession ne devait s'effectuer que 90 jours apr\u00e8s la signature du contrat, c'est-\u00e0-dire, encore une fois, le 26 octobre 1944.\nC'est donc en faisant l'application exacte des articles 409 et suivants du Code Civil que l'on doit arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que le propri\u00e9taire jusqu'\u00e0 la date du contrat sign\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite du premier jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi \u00e9tait bien l'appelant et que c'est lui qui avait droit aux fruits civils. Il ne s'agit pas de se demander s'il \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 en possession en vertu d'un titre ou non, et de bonne ou de mauvaise foi; il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire avant de donner \u00e0 Bergeron la procuration qui lui a permis d'offrir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 et il est tout simplement rest\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire jusqu'au 26 octobre 1944, alors que seulement les consentements de vendeur et d'acheteur se sont rencontr\u00e9s, et, par sa signature du contrat que lui a impos\u00e9 le premier jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, il a consenti \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 un titre translatif de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nCela dispense de d\u00e9cider (ce qui n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour la d\u00e9cision de l'appel) si l'intim\u00e9, au cas o\u00f9 il aurait eu droit \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation, n'eut pas d\u00fb plut\u00f4t proc\u00e9der par voie d'action en reddition de comptes; car, dans ce cas, l'appelant eut pu faire valoir les am\u00e9liorations qu'il pr\u00e9tend avoir apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avant qu'il n'en fasse la d\u00e9livrance \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9.\nJe suis donc d'avis que, pour toutes les raisons qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et l'action de l'intim\u00e9 doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e, avec d\u00e9pens dans toutes les Cours.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Le 7 juillet 1942, l'appelant, Adolphe Zusman, constitua Joseph Eug\u00e8ne Bergeron son mandataire et interm\u00e9diaire avec pouvoir de vendre en son nom, dans un d\u00e9lai de 30 jours, un immeuble situ\u00e9 sur la rue St-Dominique \u00e0 Jonqui\u00e8re, pour le prix de $16,500.00, payables, $5,000.00 comptant, et la balance \u00e0 raison de $100.00 par mois avec int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de 6 p. 100. Cette procuration stipulait \u00e9galement que si l'acheteur que pouvait trouver M. Bergeron n'achetait pas les marchandises qui se trouvaient dans le magasin, M. Zusman se r\u00e9servait le droit d'occuper les lieux durant trois mois apr\u00e8s la vente. Cet immeuble comprenait un magasin o\u00f9 l'appelant exer\u00e7ait son commerce, et quatre logements occup\u00e9s par des locataires.\nLe 6 ao\u00fbt de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, soit moins d'un mois apr\u00e8s que l'appelant lui e\u00fbt confi\u00e9 le mandat de vendre, Bergeron a trouv\u00e9 en la personne de l'intim\u00e9 Charles Eug\u00e8ne Tremblay, un acheteur pour l'immeuble en question. Ce dernier et Bergeron mirent alors Zusman, qui semblait vouloir se d\u00e9rober \u00e0 son obligation, en demeure de signer un acte de vente par l'interm\u00e9diaire de M. le Notaire Brown, et lui offrirent avec le projet d'acte, sign\u00e9 par Tremblay, la somme de $5,000.00, le premier versement exigible en vertu de l'entente. Ce projet de vente porte la date du 6 ao\u00fbt 1942, et comme Tremblay ne d\u00e9sirait pas se porter acqu\u00e9reur de la marchandise, il fit inclure \u00e0 l'acte une clause \u00e0 l'effet que \"la prise de possession des susdits lieux par l'acqu\u00e9reur aura lieu 90 jours apr\u00e8s la signature des pr\u00e9sentes\". On y trouve \u00e9galement la clause suivante: \"Ledit Charles E. Tremblay est consentant \u00e0 le modifier, mais toujours de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que les termes du susdit \u00e9crit sous seing priv\u00e9 soient suivis \u00e0 la lettre\". Ceci, \u00e9videmment, pour se conformer \u00e0 la jurisprudence de la Cour d'Appel. (Langlois v. Chaput 3; Charlebois v. Baril 4).\nLe d\u00e9fendeur Zusman ne signa pas ce projet, et en cons\u00e9quence Tremblay institua une action en passation de titre, avec laquelle il renouvela et consigna son offre de $5,000.00, et dans laquelle il conclut \u00e0 ce que le d\u00e9fendeur, appelant dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 lui signer l'acte de vente auquel il avait droit, ou \u00e0 ce qu'\u00e0 son d\u00e9faut, le jugement \u00e0 \u00eatre rendu \u00e9quivaille au titre. Par sa d\u00e9fense, Zusman plaida que les conditions mentionn\u00e9es au projet d'acte de vente qu'on voulait lui faire signer n'\u00e9taient pas conformes \u00e0 l'autorisation de vendre qu'il avait donn\u00e9e \u00e0 son mandataire Bergeron, et contenaient des conditions \u00e9trang\u00e8res \u00e0 l'entente orginaire. Le 9 d\u00e9cembre 1943, l'honorable Juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Chicoutimi, maintint l'action, d\u00e9clara les offres bonnes et va- lables, et apr\u00e8s avoir modifi\u00e9 le projet d'acte de vente offert \u00e0 Zusman, enjoint au demandeur de signer les modifications qu'il avait ordonn\u00e9es, et condamna le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 apposer sa signature \u00e0 l'acte offert avec les corrections qu'il avait faites. La Cour d'Appel maintint \u00e9galement l'action de l'intim\u00e9, d\u00e9clara bonnes, valables et suffisantes les offres faites par lui, et ordonna \u00e0 son tour de nouvelles corrections \u00e0 l'acte de vente projet\u00e9. Zusman signa d\u00e9finitivement le projet d'acte, tel que d\u00e9termin\u00e9 finalement par la Cour d'Appel, le 26 octobre 1944, soit au del\u00e0 de deux ans apr\u00e8s que Tremblay l'eut lui-m\u00eame sign\u00e9. Il est bon de noter que l'acte, tel que finalement re\u00e7u par M. le Notaire Brown, comportait toujours la clause \u00e0 l'effet que \"la prise de possession des susdits lieux par l'acqu\u00e9reur aura lieu 90 jours apr\u00e8s la signature des pr\u00e9sentes\".\nSubs\u00e9quemment, soit le 26 janvier 1945, l'appelant Zusman, par l'interm\u00e9diaire de son avocat, Mtre Edouard Masson, C.R., \u00e9crivit \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 une lettre pour lui r\u00e9clamer la somme de $5,504.00. Dans ce montant \u00e9taient compris 30 versements mensuels de $100.00 chacun dont le premier \u00e9tait \u00e9chu le 6 septembre 1942, repr\u00e9sentant un total de $3,000.00, et $1,380.00 d'int\u00e9r\u00eat d\u00fb sur la balance de $11,500.00 depuis le 6 septembre 1942, au taux de 6 p. 100 l'an. L'intim\u00e9 Tremblay s'est rendu \u00e0 cette demande, a pay\u00e9 les 30 versements r\u00e9clam\u00e9s, plus l'int\u00e9r\u00eat sur la balance du capital, mais le 10 ao\u00fbt 1945, par l'interm\u00e9diaire de ses procureurs d'alors, MM. St-Laurent, Gagn\u00e9 et Taschereau, il r\u00e9clama de Zusman tous les fruits civils de l'immeuble depuis le 6 ao\u00fbt 1942, soit la somme de $7,410.00 moins les taxes municipales et scolaires pay\u00e9es par Zusman au montant de $560.11, laissant une balance de $6,849.89. Comme Zusman avait donn\u00e9 effet \u00e0 la vente depuis le 6 ao\u00fbt 1942 en r\u00e9clamant les paiements mensuels et les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur la balance du capital, c'\u00e9tait la pr\u00e9tention de Tremblay que les fruits civils de l'immeuble, soit la valeur locative du magasin occup\u00e9 par Zusman, et les loyers des quatre autres locataires, devaient lui appartenir.\nSur le refus de Zusman de payer cette somme, une action a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e pour la r\u00e9clamer, et c'est cette action qui fait le sujet du pr\u00e9sent appel. Le d\u00e9fendeur-appelant contesta cette action, plaidant que les seules conventions inter- venues entre les parties et les cons\u00e9quences juridiques qui en r\u00e9sultent, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es et d\u00e9finitivement \u00e9tablies par le contrat sign\u00e9 le 26 octobre 1944, suivant les directives de la Cour d'Appel, et que, la prise de possession de l'immeuble ne devait s'effectuer que 90 jours apr\u00e8s la signature de ce contrat, soit le 26 janvier 1945. Il ajouta que l'appelant \u00e9tait un possesseur de bonne foi au sens de l'article 411 du Code Civil pendant tout le temps que l'action en passation de titre \u00e9tait pendante, puisque le projet de contrat que l'intim\u00e9 a d'abord sign\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 \u00e0 deux reprises par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour d'Appel, et qu'\u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, le recours de Tremblay \u00e9tait par action en reddition de compte. L'honorable Juge Boulanger qui a entendu la cause \u00e0 Chicoutimi en premi\u00e8re instance a maintenu l'action du demandeur, a condamn\u00e9 le d\u00e9fendeur Zusman \u00e0 payer la somme de $6,714.37 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats et d\u00e9pens. Ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec 5, le 13 d\u00e9cembre 1949, M. le Juge Aim\u00e9 Marchand \u00e9tait dissident.\nAfin de bien situer le litige et de pouvoir d\u00e9terminer qui a v\u00e9ritablement droit aux fruits civils de cet immeuble, il importe en premier lieu de se demander quelle \u00e9tait la situation juridique des parties au 6 ao\u00fbt 1942, date o\u00f9 Zusman a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en demeure de consentir un acte de vente en faveur de Tremblay. L'autorisation de vendre donn\u00e9e par Zusman constituait clairement Bergeron son mandataire pour une p\u00e9riode de 30 jours, ce dernier \u00e9tant autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 disposer de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour la somme de $16,500.00, aux conditions stipul\u00e9es \u00e0 l'acte. C'est en cette qualit\u00e9 de mandataire que Bergeron a trouv\u00e9 un acheteur en la personne de Tremblay, qui a aussit\u00f4t signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 Zusman qu'il acceptait de se porter acqu\u00e9reur aux prix, charges et conditions stipul\u00e9s \u00e0 l'acte sous seing priv\u00e9 intervenu entre Zusman et Bergeron. On se souvient que le prot\u00eat signifi\u00e9 par Mtre Brown, N.P., comporte une clause \u00e0 l'effet que si le projet de vente, d\u00fbment sign\u00e9 par Tremblay et annex\u00e9 au prot\u00eat, n'est pas en tout conforme aux conditions de l'option, Tremblay est consentant \u00e0 le modifier, \"mais toujours de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que les termes du susdit \u00e9crit sous seing priv\u00e9 soient suivis \u00e0 la lettre\". Il me semble \u00e9vident qu'\u00e0 cette date du 6 ao\u00fbt 1942, Tremblay a accept\u00e9 la pollicitation de Zusman, que le premier est en cons\u00e9quence devenu l'acheteur, et le second le vendeur de l'immeuble. Il est presqu'inutile de rappeler que par les termes m\u00eames de l'article 1472 C.C., la vente est parfaite par le consentement des parties, et cette r\u00e8gle s'applique non seulement aux meubles, mais \u00e9galement aux biens immobiliers.\nPar ce consentement donn\u00e9, une vente s'est op\u00e9r\u00e9e qui a justifi\u00e9 Tremblay d'instituer une action en passation de titre afin de confirmer dans un acte notari\u00e9 la convention intervenue. En maintenant cette action, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour d'Appel ont reconnu le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Tremblay, comme ayant exist\u00e9 depuis le 6 ao\u00fbt 1942, et c'est parce qu'il est ainsi propri\u00e9taire depuis cette date que les tribunaux ont reconnu par jugement, qui a maintenant l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e, son droit d'obtenir un titre afin de donner effet \u00e0 la vente ant\u00e9rieurement consentie. Il est vrai que la tradition de l'immeuble n'avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 op\u00e9r\u00e9e, mais dans le contrat d'ali\u00e9nation d'une chose certaine et d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, l'acqu\u00e9reur en devient propri\u00e9taire par le seul consentement des parties, quoique la tradition n'en ait pas lieu. (C.C. 1025.)\nOn objecte qu'il est impossible que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'immeuble ait pass\u00e9 \u00e0 Tremblay le 6 ao\u00fbt 1942, parce qu'on ne s'\u00e9tait pas encore entendu quant aux conditions de la vente, et qu'il a fallu et le jugement du Juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, et celui de la Cour d'Appel pour les d\u00e9terminer d\u00e9finitivement. L'appelant pr\u00e9tend que ce n'est que lorsqu'il a sign\u00e9 le contrat le 26 octobre 1944 en ex\u00e9cution du jugement de la Cour d'Appel que les droits des parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9s et que Tremblay est devenu propri\u00e9taire. Avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne puis accepter cette proposition.\nEn principe, un jugement est d\u00e9claratif de droits pr\u00e9existants. Il est vrai que certains jugements, comme ceux pronon\u00e7ant la s\u00e9paration de biens ou de corps, ou ordonnant l'interdiction, sont cr\u00e9ateurs ou attributifs de droits, parce qu'ils donnent naissance \u00e0 une situation nouvelle, et ont en cons\u00e9quence un effet constitutif. Mais quand un jugement se borne \u00e0 d\u00e9gager le droit du doute et de l'impr\u00e9cision qui l'entourent, quand il d\u00e9termine les contours incertains d'une situation juridique, alors, il ne fait que constater un \u00e9tat de chose qui lui est ant\u00e9rieur, et qui lui est par cons\u00e9quent distinct. \"C'est la pr\u00e9existence du droit ou sa cr\u00e9ation par le jugement qui est le crit\u00e8re de la distinction. (Mazeaud, Rev. Trim. D.C. 1929, p. 17); (Dalloz, Nouveau R\u00e9pertoire, Vol. 2, p. 859, N\u00b0 115.)\nOr, dans le cas qui nous occupe, je n'ai pas de doute que le jugement de la Cour d'Appel rendu le 17 juin 1944, est simplement d\u00e9claratif des droits pr\u00e9existants des parties, et leur r\u00e9sultant respectivement de l'entente du 6 ao\u00fbt 1942. Il fixe pour toujours les droits de chacun, il signale les obligations qui d\u00e9coulent de leurs conventions, et oblige les parties \u00e0 signer un document pour les constater. Il ne fait pas na\u00eetre de situation nouvelle; aucun droit jusque l\u00e0 inexistant n'est cr\u00e9\u00e9. Comme le dit le jugement formel de la Cour d'Appel, la condamnation contre Zusman est de \"signer l'acte offert tel que modifi\u00e9 pour le rendre conforme aux conventions intervenues\". Les obligations et les droits respectifs des parties ne datent donc pas du jour du jugement de la Cour d'Appel, mais bien du jour de la convention qui les a fait na\u00eetre, date \u00e0 laquelle doit r\u00e9troagir le jugement. (Mazeaud, Rev. Trim. D.C. 1929, p. 17); (Dalloz, Nouveau R\u00e9pertoire, Vol. 2, p. 859, N\u00b0 115.) Je suis donc d'opinion que Tremblay est devenu propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble en question le 6 ao\u00fbt 1942, et non pas le jour de la date du jugement de la Cour d'Appel, ou le jour o\u00f9 la convention a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e, en ob\u00e9issance \u00e0 ce jugement d\u00e9claratif.\nVoyons maintenant les cons\u00e9quences juridiques qui d\u00e9coulent du fait que Tremblay est propri\u00e9taire depuis le 6 ao\u00fbt 1942. A-t-il droit aux fruits civils, comme la valeur locative du magasin occup\u00e9 par Zusman, et les loyers des autres logements per\u00e7us par l'appelant? La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question me para\u00eet se trouver dans le texte de l'article 1498, para. 2, du Code Civil, qui se lit ainsi:\nA compter du moment de la vente tous les fruits de la chose appartiennent \u00e0 l'acheteur.\nCet article n'est que la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de l'article 409 qui dit:\nLes fruits naturels ou industriels de la terre, les fruits civils, le cro\u00eet des animaux appartiennent au propri\u00e9taire par droit d'accession. Si on lit ces deux articles avec les articles 1025 et 1472 du Code Civil, il faut de toute n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 conclure que le propri\u00e9taire a bien droit aux fruits civils d'un immeuble du moment qu'il s'en est port\u00e9 acqu\u00e9reur, m\u00eame s'il n'y a pas eu de tradition actuelle de la chose et m\u00eame si le vendeur en est rest\u00e9 en possession. C'est la r\u00e8gle que le propri\u00e9taire a la primaut\u00e9. Il peut arriver \u00e9videmment que dans certains cas, le possesseur de bonne foi, (celui qui ignore les vices de son titre) puisse faire les fruits siens (C.C. 411), mais si sa possession et entach\u00e9e de mauvaise foi, (ce mot est employ\u00e9 ici dans le sens juridique) il doit remettre tous les fruits au propri\u00e9taire qui les revendique.\nL'appelant est bien oblig\u00e9, pour invoquer cet argument, d'admettre que le titre de Tremblay \u00e0 l'immeuble remonte au 6 ao\u00fbt 1942, car \u00e9videmment l'article 411 C.C. ne peut trouver son application que lorsqu'il s'agit de la possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'autrui.\nLes faits dans la pr\u00e9sente cause ne justifient pas \u00e0 mon sens l'application de cette r\u00e8gle. En principe, quand le possesseur de bonne foi fait les fruits siens, c'est quand il poss\u00e8de, en vertu d'un titre translatif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dont il ignore les vices. Ici, c'est l'inverse qui se produit. Zusman ne poss\u00e8de pas en effet en vertu d'un titre translatif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui lui vient de Tremblay, mais c'est lui qui a vendu la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 le 6 ao\u00fbt 1942 et qui s'est obstin\u00e9 \u00e0 ne pas livrer avant le 26 ao\u00fbt 1944. M\u00eame si la r\u00e8gle s'appliquait \u00e0 son cas, et si l'on pouvait dire que celui qui refuse de livrer apr\u00e8s avoir consenti un titre translatif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 peut encore jouir des fruits civils, s'il est de bonne foi, je ne crois pas qu'avec les faits tels que r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s dans cette cause, Zusman puisse invoquer cette bonne foi, et qu'il lui soit possible de dire qu'il ne savait pas qu'il avait consenti un titre. Comme le dit Mignault, Vol. 2, \u00e0 la page 484, quand le Code parle du \"titre translatif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9\", il ne s'agit pas de l'acte ou de l'\u00e9crit qui constate le fait en vertu ou \u00e0 la suite duquel le possesseur a re\u00e7u la chose qu'il d\u00e9tient: \"c'est ce fait lui-m\u00eame, c'est-\u00e0-dire la cause de la possession\". Ainsi, le titre de la possession, c'est, pour un acheteur, non pas l'\u00e9crit qui constate le contrat de vente, mais la vente elle-m\u00eame. L'appelant pr\u00e9tend enfin qu'ind\u00e9pendamment de ce qui vient d'\u00eatre dit, il a droit aux fruits civils parce qu'il a eu possession en vertu des termes m\u00eames du contrat 90 jours apr\u00e8s la \"signature des pr\u00e9sentes\". Je crois, avec M. le Juge St-Jacques de la Cour d'Appel, que cette clause ne veut pas dire autre chose que ce qu'elle disait \u00e0 l'origine, lorsque le contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par le Notaire Brown et d\u00fbment sign\u00e9 par M. Tremblay le 6 ao\u00fbt 1942. Il \u00e9tait convenu en effet \u00e0 l'option que si l'acqu\u00e9reur n'achetait pas les marchandises qui se trouvaient dans le magasin, il ne pourrait avoir possession des lieux que 90 jours apr\u00e8s la signature de l'acte de vente. Quand le prot\u00eat a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 Zusman, il \u00e9tait essentiel d'y ins\u00e9rer cette clause concernant la prise de possession, parce que Tremblay n'achetait pas la marchandise, et il pouvait s'attendre \u00e0 ce que Zusman remplisse ses obligations et signe le contrat. De plus, comme je l'ai signal\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0, ce n'est pas la possession qui conf\u00e8re les fruits civils mais bien le titre \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il n'est pas incompatible que quelqu'un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie des fruits civils d'un immeuble, et que la possession physique demeure entre les mains d'une autre personne.\nIl importe enfin de signaler l'interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e au contrat par Zusman lui-m\u00eame. En effet, le 26 janvier 1945, soit trois mois apr\u00e8s qu'il eut sign\u00e9 le contrat, Zusman a fait \u00e9crire \u00e0 Tremblay par l'interm\u00e9diaire de son procureur, pour lui r\u00e9clamer 30 versements mensuels de $100.00 chacun, depuis le 6 septembre 1942 au 6 f\u00e9vrier 1945, plus $1,380.00 d'int\u00e9r\u00eat depuis la m\u00eame date du 6 septembre 1942 au 6 septembre 1944, sur la balance de $11,500.00 au taux de 6 p. 100 l'an. Si le contrat devait prendre effet seulement au mois d'octobre 1944, tel que le pr\u00e9tend Zusman, pourquoi a-t-il exig\u00e9 les versements dus depuis septembre 1942 et l'int\u00e9r\u00eat sur la balance depuis cette date? Il me semble clair qu'il a voulu interpr\u00e9ter le contrat, non pas comme ayant pris naissance le 26 octobre 1944, mais bien le 6 ao\u00fbt 1942. Il serait extraordinaire qu'il y eut une date \u00e0 laquelle Zusman pourrait exercer ses droits, et une autre, au del\u00e0 de deux ann\u00e9es plus tard, pour rencontrer les obligations qu'il a assum\u00e9es en vertu du contrat. Je ne crois pas qu'il y ait lieu d'intervenir et de modifier les d\u00e9cisions du juge au proc\u00e8s et de la Cour du Banc du Roi, quant \u00e0 la nature de l'action qui devait \u00eatre institu\u00e9e par Tremblay.\nPour toutes ces raisons, je suis d'avis que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a justement maintenu l'action de l'intim\u00e9 et que le pr\u00e9sent appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nRand J. (dissenting):\u2014This controversy arises out of a sale of land at Jonqui\u00e8re, Qu\u00e9bec. The appellant, Zusman, authorized an agent in writing to sell for the sum of $16,500, payable $5,000 in cash and the balance at the rate of $100 a month with interest at 6 per cent on the amount from time to time unpaid. The owner engaged himself \"\u00e0 donner un titre r\u00e9gulier\" and it was stipulated that if the purchaser should not buy the stock of merchandise then on the premises, the vendor reserved to himself \"trois mois apr\u00e8s la vente pour quitter les lieux\". The mandate provided for a commission to the agent to be \"pay\u00e9e comptant \u00e0 la signature de contrat\": its authority was to continue for one month, but the vendor retained liberty to \"sell or promise to sell\", \"si je vendais ou promettais de vendre\", subject to the payment of the commission.\nThe agent met the respondent a few days afterwards, and on or about the 15th of July the latter had intimated both to the agent and to the owner that he accepted the offer made him in accordance with the terms of the mandate. There was difficulty in bringing the vendor to the point of concluding the matter\u2014attributable, it may be, to a desire on his part to evade the bargain\u2014and on August 6 the respondent, accompanied by a notary, attended at his place of business with a deed of sale dated that day, signed by the respondent and containing a number of provisions, some of them of the usual kind, in addition to those mentioned in the mandate; and in the owner's absence formally protested him en demeure. As is seen, no particular day had been specified for completion, and the date of August 6, as well as fixing the monthly payments from that time, was an arbitrary adoption by the respondent. After the failure of other efforts to communicate with Zusman, the purchaser brought an action en passation de titre. The owner defended on a number of grounds including the impropriety of several of the stipulations of the deed. In the Superior Court, one of these was stricken out but subject to that, judgment went as prayed. On appeal, further modifications were made of the same nature and the deed finally formulated; and it was ordered that in default of execution by the vendor within a specified period, the deed was to take effect through the efficacy of the judgment. The owner was given his costs in the Court of King's Bench, but no costs were allowed in the Superior Court. Conformably to the judgment, the original document so amended, initialled by the purchaser and signed by the owner, and dated October 26, 1944, was formally completed by a notary in whose certificate the precise dates of signing by both parties were set out.\nBy an express provision the purchaser was to be entitled to possession ninety days \"apr\u00e8s la signature des pr\u00e9sentes\". This was, of course, the language of the document when it had been presented on and dated August 6, 1942. The clause dealing with price provided for the monthly payments and interest, the latter \"\u00e0 compter de ce jour\". That language, likewise, was in its original form.\nThe evidence shows beyond doubt that both parties took the reservation of ninety days' possession by the owner to run from October 26, 1944, and to terminate on January 26, 1945. On the latter day, the owner submitted a statement of what he considered to be then due and to be paid on the delivery of possession. It included instalments assumed to be payable monthly on and after September 6, 1942, to January, 1945, as well as interest on the total sum less the $5,000 for the same period. This the purchaser paid and took possession.\nLater, in 1945, the latter raised the question of the occupation by the owner from 1942 until 1945, and submitted a claim based on the ground that as of August 6, 1942 the purchaser, having accepted the offer of sale and become under art. 1472 of the Code the owner, and being under art. 410 of the Code entitled to the fruits of his property, could recover them from the former owner as a possessor not in good faith under art. 411; and on the rejection of that claim, these proceedings were instituted. In the Superior Court the claim was upheld and judgment given for the rents received and the value of the premises occupied by the owner for 26 months less the taxes that had been paid. This judgment was affirmed in the Court of King's Bench, Marchand J. dissenting 6. The ground in both courts was substantially that as formulated by the appellant, that is, that the purchaser as owner was entitled to the fruits during the period of the litigation. There is injected into the reasons the fact also that the owner not only demanded but received interest for that period, and had thereby acknowledged that the judgment in the first action as well as the document as finally executed on October 26, 1944, were retroactive to August 6, 1942.\nIt is not necessary, in the view I take of the case, to consider whether title passed to the purchaser at the moment of mutual consent to buy and to sell or when that took place, whether on the first communication of acceptance or on August 6 or at any other time, although I must observe that the particular date has not been given the consideration which, on the theory in the courts below, it would seem to me to deserve. Nor do I think the significance of the three months' retained possession, as the parties properly, in my view, construed the judgment to intend, has been fully appreciated. But as I say, these features may for my purpose be disregarded.\nWhat is being dealt with is the possession of land, land which as between the parties has been brought under the regime, one might say, of a contract. All matters here in issue, relating as they do to that possession, during the currency of the contract and in fact until its fulfilment, were and are bound by and subject to the effects flowing from its provisions. The basic right of ownership claimed by the respondent arises from it and the obligation to deliver possession and the right to or the deprivation of the fruits, likewise are wrapped up within its structure. Once made the subject-matter of the contract, the possession remains exclusively under the latter's dominion while it lasts.\nThat being the situation, arts. 1472, 410 and 411 have no relevancy whatever. What they deal with is land owned by one person in the possession of another; and the provisions of the Code draw to the ownership the right to the fruits in the circumstances which it declares. But between such parties there are no contractual relations controlling or binding that possession; what is contemplated is merely a clash of rights of ownership and of possession. Such a state of things could arise here only after the contract has been discharged from its effect on the possession and that could not be before the actual delivery of it in January, 1945.\nIf the original owner here was guilty of a breach of contract in failing to give possession before that time, then on ordinary principles of contract the purchaser would have a claim in damages and the issue would be decided in accordance with the law dealing with a default of that nature. It might be established that the purchaser, by insisting upon stipulations in the deed of sale which were ultimately struck out by the judgment, himself was the cause of that failure. Such a claim could have been made in the action for specific performance or in that action it could have been reserved, or indeed it may be open to the purchaser today to assert it. But the issues and the considerations on which it would be determined are not those in these proceedings.\nNor does the fact that the owner asked for and was paid interest from 1942 affect the matter. That claim purported to be made under the express language of the deed, where it declares the interest is to be computed \"de ce jour\", and I have little doubt that that day was October 26, 1944. But the propriety of that payment is not before us. On the face of the instrument to which both parties gave their consent, and as they interpreted it, the possession was to be given ninety days from October 26, 1944: that presents the initial obstacle to the respondent. I can see no way in which the judgment could have been made retroactive: all that was open to the Court to do was to order per- formance, and at the most, to give a judgment in contractual damages. What it could not do was to treat the relations of the parties to the land as if the contract did not exist.\nAs I have already observed, no date was fixed for the formal conclusion of the bargain. It was implied, of course, that that would be done with proper diligence; but the date was uncertain and in appropriate circumstances could have been, say, two weeks subsequent; in the event, then, of a delay caused by the purchaser, that time could be deemed enlarged to October 26, 1944, with the same effects from then as if the proper document had been executed, say, on August 20, 1942.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs and dismiss the action, but in the circumstances without costs in the Superior Court. The appellant will have his costs in the Court of King's Bench.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. Masson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: R. Fradette.\n1 Q.R.

The defendant counterclaimed, each party asserting that the other was solely to blame. The solicitors for the defendant served a jury notice. The action was tried before Kelly J. with a jury at Owen Sound and judgment was given for the plaintiff for $13,352.33 and costs.\nThe defendant appealed and his appeal was dismissed, Laidlaw J.A. dissenting1, The notice of appeal is not in the record before us but the sole ground of appeal is stated by Laidlaw JA. as follows:\u2014\nThe sole ground upon which counsel for the appellant rests the appeal is that the defendant did not have a fair trial because a witness called for the defendant referred to a visit made by her to \u201cthe insurance man\u201d in Meaford, and, notwithstanding the objections made by counsel for the defendant, the learned trial judge thereafter proceeded to the conclusion of the trial with the same jury that heard the statement of the witness.\nWhile the other learned Justices of Appeal differed from the result at Which Laidlaw JA. arrived, they agreed with this statement as to the point in issue.\nAfter the trial had proceeded for two days, counsel for the defendant called as a witness one Hilda French, the fianc\u00e9e of the defendant and the only passenger in his motor vehicle. In the course of her examination\u2011in-chief she made an answer to a question put to her by counsel for the defendant as follows:\u2014\nQ. Now, I believe you were interviewed by some person representing Mr. Theakston?\nA. Well, a lawyer came to our door at noon when I got home from work, and he wanted to know if I could tell him anything, and I did not know what to say because I did not know, and he said that he would meet me around eight o\u2019clock, and I said, Well, I work, and I went back to work at eight o\u2019clock, and so I did not know what to do so, I went to the insurance man in Meaford, and the man was not there, but a woman was there, and she told me to go to Bennett\u2019s office to find out if I had to answer any questions to this lawyer, and I went to Bennett\u2019s office, and it happened to be the very guy who came to our door at noon.\nSo as not to focus the attention of the jury on the matter, counsel for the defendant awaited the recess that followed not long after and then moved in the absence of the jury to have the jury discharged and the case traversed to the next jury sittings.\nCounsel for the plaintiff objected to the case being traversed. He stressed the delay and expense which would result, and the fact that he was in no way to blame for what had occurred. He expressed his willingness to have the trial continue either with or without a jury. The learned trial judge held, and it was conceded by counsel before us, that counsel had no intention of bringing about the mention of insurance.\nAfter hearing both counsel fully the learned trial judge made his ruling as follows:\u2014\nHis Lordship: I want to have everything on the record. I have an unpleasant duty to perform in these matters, as I have to announce my decision. My decision on this motion is that I will not strike out the jury, nor will I postpone the trial to the next court. I will, however if counsel consent, let the trial proceed before me without a jury. I do this for a number of reasons. The first and main one is the fact that this whole question of insurance was brought out by a witness produced by the defendant and by counsel for the defendant. I put myself on record that I do not for a moment impute that it was done deliberately. I think it was unfortunate that the witness was asked about the interviews, and without first discussing the interviews with her. It is exactly what you might expect to be the answer you would get if she did go to some insurance man and was not warned against mentioning it. That one point alone is sufficient for my decision, the evidence having been brought out by a witness from the side that now wants the jury struck out; and, unless by consent of counsel for the other side, I am of opinion that I should not strike out the jury. Secondly, I do not think there is any miscarriage of justice here, in any event. She explained very well that she went to an insurance agent\u2014it may have been to get advice for herself\u2014and she did not see the party who interviewed her, and she then went to a solicitor\u2019s office, and saw who she thought was a solicitor. She there discussed the matter with the solicitor, and the evidence coming out as it did, it might appear to the jury that it was likely that both sides were insured; I have grave doubts that the jury would think that only one of those cars was insured unless told otherwise, and I have already warned them not to discuss the matter with any of the parties, and that they must rely on the evidence.\nAs to mentioning about the solicitor being from Toronto, I always dislike that, and I must be frank about it, but I hear it so often. At the sittings of a court not far from this one, a certain prominent counsel never fails to bring out that fact, if it exists, no doubt hoping that the jury in that jurisdiction will give more weight to the contention of counsel who live within the jurisdiction. So, if this goes on, I will be glad to see the air cleared, but I think it is not a matter of deliberateness in bringing out the question of a party being insured. It is a matter of who brought it out and as a result of what questioning or what line of questioning, of a particular witness. Had this information been brought out by counsel for the plaintiff, I would have had a much more serious matter to deal with, but as I understand the law, and I have dealt with similar motions before, I feel that it is pretty well settled that it is a matter of which party\u2019s witness brings out the information about insurance, and as a result of questioning by counsel representing which party. So, I mustrefuse the motion. I do, however, give counsel the option as to whether he wants to proceed with this jury or proceed without. Perhaps he wishes to talk it over, or think it over for a minute or two. I will give him that right.\nCounsel for the plaintiff then said:\u2014\nI think I have already gone on record that I will be content with a trial in either manner\u2014either by your Lordship without a jury or with a jury.\nAll relevant portions of the arguments of counsel and the observations of the learned trial judge are set out in the reasons for judgment of Laidlaw J.A. and it is not necessary to reproduce them here.\nThe majority in the Court of Appeal were of the view that the learned trial judge had concluded that the jury would not reasonably infer that the defendant was insured and that his finding in this regard and his ruling that the trial should proceed with a jury ought not to be interfered with. With the greatest respect, I do not attach the same meaning to what was said by the learned trial judge as do the majority of the Court of Appeal. It appears to me that it was his view that the jury might well infer that both parties were insured. If it were necessary to decide the probable effect upon the jury of Miss French\u2019s evidence I would incline to agree with the view expressed by Laidlaw J.A. as follows:\u2014\nIt is my opinion in the present case that the jury would probably infer that the defendant was insured. They would have in mind that Miss French who made the statement about insurance was a passenger\u2014the only passenger\u2014in the motor vehicle owned and driven by the defendant, and that she was the fianc\u00e9e of the defendant. They would reasonably and probably feel that she would not willingly do anything, or say, anything, to hurt or prejudice the defendant\u2019s position in the matter of a claim against him, but on the contrary, would want to do anything she properly could to protect his interest. Therefore, the jury would conclude that when she did not know what to do after she was interviewed by a lawyer whom she did not know, and went to \u201cthe\u201d\u2014not \u201can\u201d insurance man for advice, it was the insurance man who represented or was connected with the insurance company that insured the defendant. That is the conclusion which, in my opinion, should have been reached by the learned trial judge..\nI do not understand there to be disagreement between the learned Justices of Appeal as to the principles to be deduced from the cases discussed in their reasons. They appear to me to agree (i) that where something occurs during the course of the trial from which the jury may reasonably infer that the defendant is insured the services of that particular jury should be dispensed with; (ii) that the trial judge should afford counsel a full opportunity of making submission before deciding what course should then be followed; and (iii) that having done so it is for the trial judge to decide whether to continue the trial himself without a jury or to direct that the case shall proceed before another jury. I respectfully agree with Laidlaw J.A. that the application of these principles is not dependent on the answer to the question as to which counsel inadvertently brought about the mention of insurance.\nI do not think it necessary to review the line of cases discussed in argument which establish the rule, in Ontario, that the discretion of the trial judge as to whether the trial shall proceed with or without a jury will not be interfered with by an appellate court except in extreme cases. The Court of Appeal has, however, interfered when the trial judge in reaching his decision has misdirected himself as to the rules by which he should be guided. An instance of this is to be found in Logan et al. v. Wilson et al.[2] It is said that in the case at bar the learned trial judge wrongly directed himself that the fact that the question of insurance was brought out by a witness called for the defendant in answer to a question put by counsel for the defendant was decisive against the defendant\u2019s motion, and accordingly did not exercise any discretion in arriving at his decision.\nIt appears to me that in substance what occurred was as follows. The learned trial judge refused to traverse the case for trial by another jury, and wrongly, in my respectful view, said that the trial should proceed to conclusion before the same jury. If the matter had ended there I would have found myself in respectful agreement with Laidlaw J.A. as to the proper disposition to be made of the appeal. But, having made this decision, the learned trial judge proceded to make it plain that, while he would not traverse the case for trial with another jury, he could complete the trial himself without a jury if both counsel consented. Counsel for the plaintiff had already stated that he consented to such a course and he expressly repeated this. In the result while the motion of counsel for the defendant to have the case set over for trial by another jury was definitely refused he was permitted to choose whether the trial should be completed by the learned trial judge with or without a jury. Had the learned trial judge himself decided to continue the trial without a jury it is, I think, clear that the defendant could not have complained successfully. The record before us does not disclose any further statement by counsel for the defendant but it follows from the fact that the trial continued with a jury that he did not consent to the learned trial judge completing it without a jury.\nUnder the circumstances, although not without hesitation, I have reached the conclusion that the appeal fails. While it was, I think, contrary to the established rule in Ontario for the learned trial judge to proceed with the trial before the same jury against the objection of counsel, he, in effect, gave counsel the choice between following that course and following another proper and permissible course, that of continuing without a jury. It is true that the defendant wanted neither of such courses to be followed, but having declined to consent to the permissible alterna- tive it does not appear to me that he should now be heard to complain because the other was adopted. To hold otherwise would bring about the undesirable result that the defendant could take his chance of obtaining a favourable verdict from the jury while remaining free to demand a new trial if the verdict should prove adverse.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe dissenting judgment of Kellock and Estey JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal from the judgment at trial in favour of the plaintiff, respondent, entered after the verdict of a jury in an action and counterclaim arising out of a collision between motor cars. The appeal is taken upon the ground that, during the course of the examination-in-chief of a witness for the defendant, information was disclosed from which the jury might reasonably infer that the defendant was insured. In the court below, the majority, Aylesworth and Mackay JJ.A., were of opinion that in the view of the trial judge it was not open to the jury to draw such inference. Laidlaw J.A., dissenting, being of a different opinion, would have allowed the appeal. The learned trial judge, in the course of his reasons, said:\nThe evidence coming out as it did, it might appear to the jury that it was likely that both sides were insured.\nI find myself in agreement with the view of Laidlaw J.A. as to the construction to be placed upon this finding and, with respect, on consideration of the evidence of the witness in question, I think that this view is well founded. We heard no argument founded on the possibility that the jury might, from what occurred, also draw the inference that the plaintiff was insured, so that the case is to be considered apart from such a question. It is to be observed that the learned trial judge absolved the appellant\u2019s counsel of anything other than inadvertence in connection with the disclosure in question.\nThe appellant contends in these circumstances, that the proper course which ought to have been pursued by the trial judge, was to have dismissed the jury and, after having obtained the views of counsel as to continuing with- out the jury or traversing the case to another jury sittings, should have exercised his discretion as to one or the other course, but that he ought not to have, as he in fact did, continued the trial with the same jury.\nFor the respondent it is argued that the appellant has not gone far enough and that it was uncumbent upon him to show that there had been an actual miscarriage in that, for example, the verdict was perverse or the damages were excessive. Reliance was placed upon the provisions of s. 27(1) of the Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 100, which provides that\nA new trial shall not be granted on the ground of mis-direction or of the improper admission or rejection of evidence, or because the verdict of the jury was not taken upon a question which the judge at the trial was not asked to leave to the jury, or by reason of any omission or irregularity in the course of the trial, unless some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned.\nIn Loughead v. Collingwood Ship Building Company,[3] the defendant applied to a Divisional Court for a new trial upon the ground that during the cross-examination of one of its witnesses, counsel for the plaintiff, against the objection of counsel for the defendant, was permitted to prove that the defendant company was insured. The majority, Falconbridge C.J. and Riddell J., in directing a new trial, held that it was not a case of improper admission of evidence, with respect to which Consolidated Rule 785, the predecessor of s. 27 of The Judicature Act, would be an answer. In their view, the mere putting of such a question to a witness did the mischief and placed the defendant \u201cin a position of manifest and incurable disadvantage.\u201d\nThey held that the proper course which the trial judge ought to have pursued in the circumstances was that above set out in the contention of the appellant.\nOn the other hand, Anglin J., as he then was, was of opinion that while prior to the rule a clear case for a new trial would have been made out, nevertheless, the rule forbade such a course unless a substantial wrong or miscarriage were shown. In his opinion, that had not been established. The view of the majority prevailed in the Court of Appeal,[4] the appeal being dismissed. We were referred on the argument to the decision of the Divisional Court in Mitchell v. Heintzman,[5] but if there is anything in that decision opposed to the decision of the Court of Appeal, it cannot, of course, stand. The court in Mitchell\u2019s case would appear to have thought that the facts did not bring the case before them within the principle of the earlier decision. I take the law, therefore, to be established as laid down in Loughead\u2019s case, with which I respectfully agree. While it may come about that as a result of compulsory insurance or other circumstances, the mention of insurance before a jury may lose the significance which, up to the present, it has been considered to have in cases of the character under discussion, I do not think that circumstances have sufficiently changed since that decision to render its principle no longer applicable.\nIn Fillion v. O\u2019Neill[6], a witness for the plaintiff, in answer to a question put by the learned trial judge, gave information which, in the view of the learned judge, disclosed that the defendant was insured. Thereupon he discharged the jury without giving the plaintiff\u2019s counsel the right to \u201celect\u201d whether to go on without the jury or to have the case stand over to another jury sittings. An appeal was allowed on the ground that the plaintiff had been deprived of \u201ca substantial right\u201d which the same court in the later case, Craig v. Milligan[7], defined as the right to place his position fully before the learned trial judge. Having done so, however, the court held that the learned trial judge in such case, after hearing both parties, is not bound by any election or preference of either of the parties. He is entitled to exercise his own discretion under s. 55(3) of The Judicature Act, but he must not continue the trial with the existing jury.\nIn the case at bar, at the close of the evidence given by the witness who had made the disclosure as to the insurance, counsel for the appellant applied to the learned trial judge in the absence of the jury, to traverse the case to another sittings. On the other hand, counsel for the respondent took the stand that the learned judge had \u201can extremely wide discretion as to whether you will carry on with the jury or not,\u201d and that he was content to have the case proceed before the learned judge either without the jury or with the existing jury, but he opposed any traverse.\nAt the conclusion of the argument, the learned judge decided that he would not, of himself, strike out the jury or traverse the trial, but that he would, with the consent of counsel, strike out the jury. He founded his decision upon the fact that the disclosure had come about as a result of a question by counsel for the appellant and that \u201cthat one point alone\u201d was sufficient for his decision. In the second place, he said he did not think there was any miscarriage of justice for the reason that, as set out above, it might appear to the jury that it was likely that both parties were insured. The learned judge, however, made it very clear that\nIt is a matter of who brought it out and as a result of what questioning or what line of questioning of the particular witness. Had this information been brought out by counsel for the plaintiff, I would have had a much more serious matter to deal with, but as I understand the law and I have dealt with similar motions before, I feel that it is pretty well settled that it is a matter of which party\u2019s witness brings out the information about insurance, and as a result of questioning by counsel representing which party.\nHe concluded as follows:\nSo I must refuse the motion. I do, however, give counsel the option as to whether he wants to proceed with this jury or proceed without.\nDuring the course of the argument, counsel for the appellant had offered to refer his Lordship to the authorities, but the learned trial judge said that he was familiar with them. It is plain, however, that his decision was given upon a mistaken view as to what had been laid down in those authorities. It is irrelevant whether the information is disclosed in answer to a question by either counsel or by the learned trial judge, where, as here, the examining counsel is found by the trial judge to be innocent. The authorities are equally clear as to the course which the learned judge ought to have taken.\nThe foundation of the decision in Loughead\u2019s case is that it is to be assumed that a fair trial cannot be had if evidence is given in a case from which the jury may conclude that the party against whom liability is sought to be enforced, is insured. Accordingly, the proper course for an appellate court to follow would be to direct a new trial unless there can be said to be anything in the particular circumstances of the case at bar by reason of which the appellant should be held to have lost that right. In my opinion, that situation does not exist.\nIn the first place, the course actually followed in completing the trial was one which was not open to the learned trial judge. That course was taken because the appellant refused a consent he was under no obligation to give. He had given a jury notice and was quite entitled to ask that the trial of the action and counterclaim take place before a jury. While it is quite true that, in the exercise of his discretion, the learned judge could have tried the case without a jury whether the appellant consented or not, and that, had he done so the appellant could not have complained, the decision of the learned judge was not reached in the exercise of any discretion vested in him, but in reality in abdication of the discretion he did have, the course taken being in no way induced or contributed to by the appellant. I therefore think that the \u201cchoice\u201d offered the appellant is irrelevant with reference to the question now under consideration, and I do not think it ought to be held against the appellant that counsel did not persist, in the circumstances, in putting forward his view of the law after judgment.\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs here and in the court below. As the abortive trial was contributed to by the respondent, as I have already pointed out, I think the costs of that trial ought to be reserved to the discretion of the judge presiding at the new trial.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Richardson & Shearer.\nSolicitors for the respondent: MacKay & McAvoy.\n[1] [1950] O.R. 524.\n[2] [1943] 4 D.L.R. 512.\n[3] (1908) 16 O.L.R. 64.\n[4] 12 O.W.R. 697.\n[5] 4 O.W.N. 636.\n[6] [1934] O.R. 716.\n[7] [1949] O.R. 806.\n"

Father Bruck, who had been continuously director of the orphanage from 1906 to the date of his death in 1947, predeceased the testatrix, who died in 1949. On an application to determine whether because of Father Bruck's death an intestacy existed, or whether the words of the will amounted to a bequest to him as \"Director of\" said orphanage.\nHeld: that the words of the will must be interpreted in their grammatical and ordinary sense and so interpreted the words \"unto Reverend William Bruck o.m.i.

Lucey passed under her will to the respondent, The Catholic Orphanage of Prince Albert, commonly known as St. Patrick's Orphanage.\nThe question raised is whether on a proper construction of the will the estate was given beneficially to the Reverend William Bruck, in which case, he having predeceased the testatrix, it would pass to those entitled on an intestacy, or whether it was given either directly to St. Patrick's Orphanage or to the Reverend William Bruck as trustee for the Orphanage.\nThe will is a short one. It reads as follows:\nThis is the Last Will and Testament of me, Nellie A. Lucey of the City of Prince Albert, in the Province of Saskatchewan.\nI devise and bequeath all the real and personal estate to which I will be entitled at the time of my decease, unto Reverend William Bruck o.m.i. St. Patricks Orphanage of the City of Prince Albert in the Province of Saskatchewan, absolutely, and I appoint the said Reverend William Bruck sole Executor of this my Will; hereby revoking all former Testamentary writing. In Wittness (sic) whereof I the said Nellie A. Lucey the Testatrix, have to this, my Last Will and Testament, set my hand and seal this 2nd (second) day of December 1929.\nSIGNED by the said Testatrix as and for her last Will and Testament, in the Presence of us, present at the same time who at her request, in her presence and in the presence of each other, have subscribed our names as wittnesses. (sic)\n(Signed) NELLIE A. LUCEY.\n(Signed) ELIZABETH SEREDA.\n(Signed) FRED SCHWALK. The Reverend Father Bruck died on January 9, 1947. The testatrix died on April 6, 1949.\nThe respondent was incorporated by Special Act (1915, Statutes of Saskatchewan, c. 46) with power inter alia to acquire by gift, devise or bequest any real or personal estate.\nFor the appellants it is contended that the wording of the will in plain and unambiguous terms gives the whole of the estate to the Reverend William Bruck beneficially, and that the courts below have erred in admitting extrinsic evidence and in the construction which they have placed upon the will.\nCounsel for the respondent contends that the words \"unto Reverend William Bruck o.m.i. St. Patrick's Orphanage of the City of Prince Albert in the Province of Saskatchewan,\" describe as donee the Orphanage rather than the Reverend Father Bruck, that all of the words quoted Which precede the word \"Orphanage\" are descriptive of the Orphanage and that, while the words \"St. Patrick's Orphanage\" might well have been a sufficient description, the words \"Reverend William Bruck o.m.i.\" were inserted as a further description out of an abundance of caution. Counsel argues that if the words \"St. Patrick's Orphanage\" had been intended merely as the address of the Reverend William Bruck the word \"of\" would have been inserted before the words \"St. Patrick's Orphanage\" or a comma would have been inserted after the initials \"o.m.i.\" Alternatively the respondent submits that the words describing the donee are equally apt to describe either the Orphanage or the Reverend Father Bruck and that extrinsic evidence of the intention of the testatrix was admissible and shows that such intention was to make the Orphanage the donee.\nIn the further alternative the respondent contends that if the words are held to describe the Reverend Father Bruck as donee then, on the proper construction of the will, read in the light of the surrounding circumstances, he takes as director, or as the member of the O.M.I. in charge, of the Orphanage and as trustee for it.\nIt is, I think, clear that the Court, unless it may take judicial notice of the meaning of the letters \"o.m.i.\", is entitled to be informed by evidence of their proper meaning. The affidavit of the Reverend Charles Charron makes it clear that these letters following the name of the Reverend William Brack indicate that he was a member of an Order of priests in the Roman Catholic Church known as \"Oblates of Mary Immaculate\" and that as such member he had taken perpetual vows of obedience, chastity and poverty.\nOur first task is to interpret the words, in which the testatrix has expressed herself, in their grammatical and ordinary sense. I cannot bring myself to doubt that, so interpreted, the words \"unto Reverend William Brack o.m.i. St. Patrick's Orphanage of the City of Prince Albert in the Province of Saskatchewan\" mean that the gift of the testatrix' estate is to the individual whose name is Reverend William Bruck and who is further described by the initials and words which follow his name, the letters \"o.m.i.\" denoting the Order to which he belonged and the words \"St. Patrick's Orphanage\" the place where he lived, the institution of which he was director and in which he carried on his life work. The words do not appear to me to be susceptible of the interpretation that the estate is given \"unto St. Patrick's Orphanage\" and that the preceding words \"Reverend William Bruck o.m.i.\" are simply descripive of the Orphanage. It would, I think, involve a violent and unnatural construction to regard the words \"Reverend William Bruck\" or \"Reverend William Bruck o.m.i.\" as an adjectival phrase descriptive of St. Patrick's Orphanage, and I do not think the testatrix so employed them. This view is, in my opinion, somewhat strengthened by the use of the words \"the said\" in the sentence which follows \"\u2014and I appoint the said Reverend William Bruck sole executor of this my will\".\u2014The testatrix first gives her estate to Reverend William Bruck and then appoints \"the said Reverend William Bruck\" her executor. I have concluded that the words of the will mean that the donee of the estate is the Reverend William Bruck and not the Orphanage.\nIt is next necessary to consider the argument of the respondent that if it should be held that the gift is to the Reverend William Bruck it is made to him not beneficially but virtute officii impressed with a trust for the benefit of the Orphanage. In none of the cases to which counsel referred was a gift to a named individual held to be other than a beneficial gift merely because such individual was described as the holder of an office.\nIn re Delany, Conoley v. Quick 5, Farwell J. quotes with approval from the judgment of Kindersley V.C. in Thornber v. Wilson 6. (A ease in which there was a devise\u2014subject to a term of seven years\u2014of real estate on trust to sell and pay the net residue of the proceeds of the sale \"to the then Minister of the Roman Catholic chapel at Kendal\") as follows:\nThe question whether there is a charitable gift does not depend on the fact that there is a gift to an individual describing him as minister; but on this, whether the testator designates the individual as such, or as being the person who happens to fill the office. A gift to a minister as such, is a charitable bequest. I think here the intention was clearly to benefit the minister and chapel; it was not a personal bequest, with a description of the person to be benefited. A gift to the person now minister would have been different; the testator might be unacquainted with his name, and so only be capable of describing him by his office. And here the surplus is only to be realized at the end of seven years after the testator's death, which makes it stronger to shew that the testator meant to benefit the chapel, not the particular person.\nFarwell J. continues \"The mere description of the legatee as the holder of an office is not, of course, sufficient to raise any such inference.\" (i.e. an inference that it was not a personal bequest.)\nThe sentence last quoted was not strictly necessary to the decision of the case with which Farwell J. was dealing but, after such search as I have been able to make, I have not found any reported case which appears to be at variance with it, and in my respectful opinion it correctly states the law.\nIn Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. 34, page 320, section 370, the matter is put as follows:\nThe mere descripion of a donee as the holder of an office is not of itself sufficient to raise the inference that the gift is for the benefit of the office and not of the holder personally, unless the context and circumstances show that the holder for the time being was intended. A gift, however, to a person either described as, or known to the testator as, the holder of an office, \"or his successors,\" or a gift to the holder of an office for the time being, is for the benefit of the office or of the association or body in which the office is held. This appears to me to be an accurate statement of the law, supported by the authorities cited and by the reasoning of Jenkins J. in Re Flinn, Public Trustee v. Griffin, 7 where a number of cases are collected and analysed.\nIt is argued for the respondent that, even if the statement of the law quoted above from Halsbury be accepted, in the case at bar the context and circumstances should lead the court to decide that the intention of the testatrix was that the Reverend Father Bruck should take not beneficially but as director of and trustee for the Orphanage; and that extrinsic evidence of these circumstances was properly admitted. Reliance is placed on placitum 96 in Sir James Wigram's treatise on Extrinsic Evidence in Aid of the Interpretation of Wills, 5th Edition, page 83, reading as follows:\nEvery claimant under a will has a right to require that a Court of construction, in the execution of its office, shall\u2014by means of extrinsic evidence\u2014place itself in the situation of the testator, the meaning of whose language it is called upon to declare.\nAccepting this, it appears to me that the following facts set out in the affidavit of the Reverend Charles Charron were properly admitted in evidence.\n(i) That Reverend Father William Bruck was director of St. Patrick's Orphanage from the year 1906 until his death in 1947.\n(ii) That he was a member of the Order known as the \"Oblates of Mary Immaculate\" and had made a perpetual vow of poverty and that the fact that he had made such vow was known to the testatrix.\n(iii) That the Orphanage had no Board of Directors and that Reverend Father Bruck was in full charge of its administration and devoted all his time, energy and attention to the furtherance of its objects.\n(iv) That the testatrix was a Roman Catholic, had come to Prince Albert in 1929 and in her lifetime had made contributions and paid money to Reverend Father Bruck for the benefit of the Orphanage.\n(v) That she was a spinster and apparently had not kept in close touch with her brothers, the appellants.\n(vi) That she was admitted to the Saskatchewan Hospital on November 7, 1947, having become mentally senile and unable to attend to herself and her affairs.\nWith such added light as this information affords I am unable to construe the words of the will as making the Reverend Father Bruck a trustee for the Orphanage. Even if the words are read, as counsel for the respondent contends they should be, \"unto Reverend William Bruck, member of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate in charge of St. Patrick's Orphanage\" they still appear to me to be words of gift to the Reverend Father who is further described as the holder of an office. To indicate that he was to take as trustee it would have been necessary for the testatrix to add some such words as \"or his successor\" or \"or the member of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate for the time being in charge of St. Patrick's Orphanage.\"\nI have found no case which decides, and I do not think that it should be held, that the fact that a beneficiary is described in a will as a member of an order, vowed to poverty, is of itself sufficient to prevent his taking beneficially.\nIn In Re Barclay 8, a testatrix by her will dated September 7, 1903, gave the residue of all her property, after the death of G., to whom she had given a life interest, in the following terms: \"To the Superior of the Jesuit Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street, London, to the Superior of that Church at the moment of the legacy falling due, and failing him to any other representative Father of the Order of the Society of Jesus * * *\" The testatrix died in 1910, and G. died in 1928. The Superior of the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street, London, was not the same person at the death of the testatrix as at the death of G. Tomlin J. held that this was a valid gift to the Superior at the death of G. absolutely. At page 182, Tomlin J. says:\nIn my opinion the gift to a person described as the Superior does not per se make him a trustee, even though he may not be personally known to the testatrix, nor do I think he can be fixed with a trust, because by vow or otherwise, he is under some obligation of conscience carrying no legal sanction to deal with what he receives in a particular way.\nThe Court of Appeal varied the order of Tomlin J. holding that the Superior took the gift \"upon trust to apply the same for the benefit of the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street, London, as he may in his discretion think fit\"; but I can find nothing in the judgments delivered in the Court of Appeal at variance with the statement of Tomlin J. that a person cannot be fixed with a trust, because by vow or otherwise, he is under some obligation of conscience carrying no legal sanction to deal with what he receives in a particular way. The Court of Appeal proceeded on the grounds (i) that the gift was not to a named individual but to a person who might and in all probability would be quite unknown to the testatrix, a person designated by his office, and that office one held in connection with the Farm Street church, (ii) that there was an alternative gift, should the office of Superior be vacant, to \"any other representative Father of the Order of the Society,\" (iii) that the will directed that in certain events two legacies should be paid by the Society of Jesus, (iv) that the testatrix in her will explained the reason of the gift \u2014namely, gratitude to the Society of Jesus for her receipt of the grace of the true faith.\nI have not overlooked the use of the word \"absolutely\". It can not assist the contention of the respondent but is not, of itself, necessarily decisive against the view that the gift was in trust. Had the will contained words sufficient to indicate that the testatrix intended the Reverend Father Bruck to take qua trustee, it might then have appeared that the word \"absolutely\" was inserted by the testatrix for some such reason as that suggesed by Clauson J. in Ray's Witt Trusts 9 where the learned judge held that the use of the word \"absolutely\" following a gift to an abbess for the purposes, as he held, of the convent over which she presided, was merely to show that she was to be free from any fetter or trust which would bind her to keep the fund intact as an endowment for the purposes of the community and that the legacy was to go into the funds of the society and to be used without fetter for any purpose for which the funds of the society could be used.\nIn my opinion those portions of the affidavit of the Reverend Charles Charron which state that the testatrix had in her lifetime told him that it was her intention to leave all her estate to and for the benefit of St. Patrick's Orphanage and that she had made out her will in favour of St. Patrick's Orphanage were inadmissible.\nIt is, I think, sufficient to refer to the statement of Lord Cairns in Charter v. Charter 10.\n* * * My Lords, upon one part of the case I have never entertained any doubt. I hold it to be clear, as I think all your Lordships do, that this is not a case in which any parol evidence of statements of the testator, as to whom he intended to benefit, or supposed he had benefited, by his will, can be received * * * I am of opinion that it ought to have been excluded. The only case in which evidence of this kind can be received is where the description of the legatee, or of the thing bequeathed, is equally applicable in all its parts to two persons, or to two things. That clearly cannot be said of the present case.\nI have already expressed my opinion that the words of this will are apt to describe the Reverend William Bruck as donee of the estate and are not apt to so describe the respondent. I do not read the reasons of the learned Chief Justice of the King's Bench or those of the Court of Appeal as indicating that they regarded such evidence of intention as admissible.\nThere is, I think, no doubt that if the Reverend Father Bruck had survived the testatrix he would have used all of her estate either for the Orphanage or for other equally worthy objects and would have retained nothing whatever for himself; but, in my opinion, no obligation to so deal with the estate was imposed upon him by the words which the testatrix has used in her will.\nFor the above reasons I have reached the conclusion that, on a true construction of this will, the Reverend William Bruck, had he survived the testatrix, would have been beneficially entitled to the whole of her estate. It follows from this that as he predeceased her the gift to him lapses.\nThe appeal should be allowed accordingly and judgment should be entered declaring that the administrator with the will annexed holds the estate of the late Nellie A. Lucey in trust for those persons who, under the laws of Saskatchewan, would have been entitled thereto had she died intestate. The orders as to costs made by the Chief Justice of the King's Bench and by the Court of Appeal should stand and the costs of all parties of the appeal to this court should be paid out of the estate, those of the administrator with the will annexed on a solicitor and client basis.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Moxon, Schmitt & Estey.\nSolicitors for the respondent, The Catholic Orphanage of Prince Albert: Diefenbaker, Cuelenaere & Hall.\n1 [1950] 2 W.W.R. 1167.\n2 [1950] 1 W.W.R. 1057.\n3 [1950] 2 W.W.R. 1167.\n4 [1950] 1 W.W.R. 1057.\n5 [l902] 2 Ch. 642.\n6 (1858) 4 Drew. 350 at 351.\n7 [1948] 1 All E.R. 541.\n8 [1929] 2 Ch. 173.\n9 [1936] 1 Ch. 520 at 526.\n10 (1874) L.R. 7 H.L. 364 at 376.\n"

The contents of the will were communicated to the nephew who took possession of the property forthwith, paid the taxes and insurance. Subsequently, in 1939, the testator made in the U.S.A. a will in the English form in which, after disposing of his residence there and making several pecuniary bequests, he left the \"residue\" of his property to certain relatives of his deceased wife in the U.S.A. and named an American trust company his executor. The opening paragraph of that will contained the customary clause \"hereby revoking any and all former wills made by me\". The nephew survived the testator and at his death the property passed to his wife, the respondent. The trust company sold the property to the appellant who sued respondent for possession and for rental. The action was allowed in the Superior Court but dismissed in the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed as the later will did not revoke the former expressly or by the nature of its dispositions. A formal clause such as here is not sufficient if the terms of both wills can be read so as to have effect. The intention of the testator was clearly that the second will should only dispose of the property other than that disposed of by the former will.\nPer Rand and Kellock JJ.: The foreign trust company was not empowered to carry on business in the Province of Quebec and to make the sale in question as it was not registered under the Quebec Trust Companies Act.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1 dismissing an action for possession and for rental.\nL.

Gay, dont l'un fut fait dans la ville de Lauzon, province de Qu\u00e9bec, le 27 ao\u00fbt 1937, et l'autre, le 6 d\u00e9cembre 1939, \u00e0 Dormont, comt\u00e9 d'Alleghany, dans l'\u00e9tat de la Pennsylvanie, o\u00f9 le testateur avait son domicile.\nPar le premier, Arthur Gay donnait et l\u00e9guait tous les biens meubles et immeubles, sans aucune exception, qu'il d\u00e9laisserait en Canada au jour de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 son neveu, Wilfrid Guay.\nIl est admis que les biens meubles et immeubles ainsi l\u00e9gu\u00e9s comprenaient la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 situ\u00e9e \u00e0 Lauzon, portant le num\u00e9ro civique 31 de la rue Sainte-Sophie, que l'appelant revendique pr\u00e9sentement, dont il veut faire d\u00e9guerpir l'intim\u00e9e (qui est la veuve de Wilfrid Gay) et contre laquelle il a pratiqu\u00e9 une saisie-gagerie.\nPar le testament post\u00e9rieur, Arthur Gay l\u00e9guait \u00e0 des personnes demeurant aux \u00c9tats-Unis \"all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed\", et il nommait comme ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire la \"Monongahela Trust Company\", de Homestead, Pennsylvanie.\nLa question qui se pose est de savoir quel effet peut avoir eu sur le premier testament la clause suivante par laquelle le second commence:\nI, ARTHUR GAY, of the Borough of Dormont, County of Alleghany and State of Pennsylvania, being of sound mind and memory, do hereby make, publish and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, hereby revoking any and all former wills made by me.\nLe litige r\u00e9sulte du fait que l'ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire nomm\u00e9e dans le second testament a vendu \u00e0 l'appelant, le 13 d\u00e9cembre 1948, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9 Lauzon l\u00e9gu\u00e9e au mari de l'intim\u00e9e par le premier testament et que l'appelant demande maintenant d'\u00eatre mis en possession de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l'action et la saisie-gagerie, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e n'avait aucun droit d'occuper cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et lui a enjoint de quitter les lieux.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) 2 a unanimement infirm\u00e9 ce jugement. Trois des juges ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que les circonstances qui ont entour\u00e9 la remise de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Wilfrid Guay, en 1937, l'avait rendu d\u00e9finitivement propri\u00e9taire, et les deux autres que, lors de la vente faite par l'ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire \u00e0 l'appelant, ses fonctions et ses pouvoirs \u00e9taient \u00e9puis\u00e9s et qu'il s'ensuit que l'appelant n'a pas prouv\u00e9 ce qu'il a all\u00e9gu\u00e9: qu'il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble occup\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e.\nUne autre raison accept\u00e9e par deux des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) (1) est que, comme la \"Monongahela Trust Company\" est une corporation incapable, d'apr\u00e8s la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, d'agir comme ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire, et que la loi \u00e9trang\u00e8re qui la r\u00e9git n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant diff\u00e9rente de celle du Qu\u00e9bec, il doit \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que sa nomination comme ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire n'est pas valide et que cons\u00e9quemment elle n'avait pas le pouvoir n\u00e9cessaire pour consentir l'acte de vente \u00e0 l'appelant.\nDeux remarques s'imposent d\u00e8s l'abord: 1\u00b0 La \"Monongahela Trust Company\" n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e dans la cause, quoique l'intim\u00e9e, par les conclusions de sa d\u00e9fense, ait demand\u00e9 que la vente \u00e0 l'appelant, ainsi que son enregistrement, soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s nuls, ill\u00e9gaux et inexistants et soient annul\u00e9s; 2\u00b0 Que le testament lui-m\u00eame, du 6 d\u00e9cembre 1939, soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ill\u00e9gal et nul comme fait par une personne incapable de d\u00e9cider et comme non accompagn\u00e9 des formes et des formalit\u00e9s prescrites.\nDans ces conditions, la question qui s'est pos\u00e9e imm\u00e9diatement \u00e9tait de savoir si les conclusions de l'intim\u00e9e pouvaient \u00eatre accord\u00e9es par les tribunaux en l'absence de l'ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire et hors de sa pr\u00e9sence.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) 3 ne semble pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9e par cette objection et elle s'est content\u00e9e, dans le jugement qu'elle a rendu, de d\u00e9clarer qu'elle pouvait accueillir les conclusions de l'intim\u00e9e \"aux fins de la maintenir dans ses d\u00e9fenses de simple rejet de l'action, et sans adjuger sur ses conclusions, irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement form\u00e9es d'ailleurs, de la nature de demandes aux p\u00e9titoires\". Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli, d'ailleurs, au cours de l'argumentation devant cette Cour qu'une action p\u00e9titoire est actuellement pendante entre les parties. Demande a m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, au cours du proc\u00e8s, de suspendre l'adjudication dans la pr\u00e9sente instance jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le p\u00e9titoire ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9, mais cette demande n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e.\nLes parties \u00e0 cet appel doivent se rendre compte que tout jugement de la part de cette Cour qui aurait pour effet d'annuler le second testament, ainsi que l'acte de vente \u00e0 l'appelant par l'ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire nomm\u00e9e dans ce testament, ne peut jamais valoir qu'entre les parties \u00e0 l'appel et que le rem\u00e8de de la tierce opposition reste ouvert \u00e0 la \"Monongahela Trust Company\". Dans les circonstances, il eut peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable que, avant d'adjuger sur la cause qui nous est soumise, on eut attendu le r\u00e9sultat de l'action p\u00e9titoire \u00e0 laquelle il eut pour le moins \u00e9t\u00e9 recommandable que l'on mit en cause la \"Monongahela Trust Company\". Nous devons, sur ce point, rappeler les d\u00e9cisions de cette Cour dans les causes de Burland v. Moffatt 4 ; Montreal Agencies Limited v. Kimpton 5 ; Corporation de la Paroisse de St-Gervais v. Goulet 6 ; Christin v. Piette et Pelletier 7.\nNous croyons, cependant, pouvoir trancher le litige qui nous est soumis, au moins dans sa partie essentielle, en le traitant comme l'a fait la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) 8 et sans adjuger sur les conclusions \"irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement form\u00e9es d'ailleurs\" (pour employer l'expression de la Cour d'Appel), mais, comme on le comprendra, le pr\u00e9sent jugement est strictement limit\u00e9 aux droits des parties en cause.\nJ'en suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion qu'une stricte interpr\u00e9tation des deux testaments permet de les consid\u00e9rer comme compatibles et que, par cons\u00e9quent, le second n'a pas eu pour effet de mettre le premier de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nNous devons rester ici dans le domaine de la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, car la loi du domicile n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e et il s'ensuit qu'elle doit \u00eatre tenue pour semblable \u00e0 celle de la province de Qu\u00e9bec (voir le jugement de Sir Lyman Duff J.C. dans Trottier v. Rajotte 9. Il est \u00e0 remarquer tout d'abord que le second testament ne r\u00e9voque pas express\u00e9ment le premier. Les mots: \"hereby-revoking any and all former wills made by me\" sont exprim\u00e9s en termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. Il n'y est pas r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 au premier testament en termes expr\u00e8s. Or, l'article 892 du Code Civil \u00e9dicte que \"un testament ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 par le testateur que 1\u00b0\u2014par un testament post\u00e9rieur qui le r\u00e9voque express\u00e9ment ou par la nature de ses dispositions; 2\u00b0\u2014par un acte devant notaire ou autre acte par \u00e9crit, par lequel le changement de volont\u00e9 est express\u00e9ment constat\u00e9\".\nL'emploi dans chacun de ces sous-paragraphes de l'article 892 du mot \"express\u00e9ment\" est significatif.\nEn plus, il faut en rapprocher l'article 896 qui, sans doute, parle de l'effet d'une r\u00e9vocation sur un testament ant\u00e9rieur mais qui, tout de m\u00eame, s'exprime comme suit:\nA d\u00e9faut de disposition expresse, c'est par les circonstances et les indices de l'intention du testateur qu'il est d\u00e9cid\u00e9 si la r\u00e9vocation du testament qui en r\u00e9voque un autre, est destin\u00e9e \u00e0 faire revivre le testament ant\u00e9rieur.\nL\u00e0, encore, le Code emploie le mot \"expresse\".\nEnfin, l'article 894 \u00e9dicte que:\nLes testaments post\u00e9rieurs qui ne r\u00e9voquent pas les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents d'une mani\u00e8re expresse, n'y annulent que les dispositions incompatibles avec les nouvelles ou qui y sont contraires.\nEt, de nouveau, l'on trouve ici et toujours la condition que la r\u00e9vocation soit faite d'une \"mani\u00e8re expresse\".\nOr, il est \u00e9vident que l'on ne peut pr\u00e9tendre que le testament de 1939 r\u00e9voque express\u00e9ment le testament de 1937 et que le changement de volont\u00e9 n'est pas express\u00e9ment constat\u00e9. Dans ce cas, l'on me para\u00eet justifi\u00e9, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de disposition expresse, de chercher dans les circonstances et les indices de l'intention du testateur si r\u00e9ellement la nature des dispositions de l'un et l'autre des testaments fait qu'ils se contredisent.\nComme l'a fait remarquer la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) 10, les deux testaments peuvent parfaitement \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s l'un avec l'autre, le premier disposant, suivant ses termes, de \"tous les biens meubles et immeubles, sans aucune exception, que je d\u00e9laisserai en Canada\", et l'autre disposant des biens meubles et immeubles que Gay a laiss\u00e9s au jour de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s aux \u00c9tats-Unis.\nToutes les circonstances et les indices relev\u00e9s par la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) 11 et soulign\u00e9s dans son jugement conduisent \u00e0 cette interpr\u00e9tation. Les faits prouv\u00e9s dans la cause indiquent que le testateur Arthur Gay, \u00e0 la suite de la mise en possession qu'il a faite \u00e0 Lauzon en faveur de son neveu, Wilfrid Guay, et toutes les circonstances qui ont entour\u00e9 cette mise en possession, avait l'intention de faire une transmission d\u00e9finitive de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il la consid\u00e9rait, d\u00e8s lors, comme \u00e9tant sortie de son domaine et comme \u00e9tant devenue le bien de Wilfrid Guay \u00e0 tel point que, lorsqu'il disposa de ses biens aux \u00c9tats-Unis, par le testament de 1939, il n'avait aucunement l'intention d'y inclure la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 situ\u00e9e \u00e0 Lauzon. Cette intention ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9duite des termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux employ\u00e9s en t\u00eate de son testament de 1939, r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par un homme de l'art, et qui, \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards, peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme une clause de style.\nOn lit dans le Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de Droit civil de Planiol 8e \u00e9d. (1921) tome 3, p. 709, n\u00b0 2842:\nMalgr\u00e9 leurs formules absolues, par lesquelles les testateurs d\u00e9clarent r\u00e9voquer toutes les dispositions ant\u00e9rieures; les r\u00e9vocations expresses sont susceptibles d'\u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es, et certaines dispositions de date plus ancienne peuvent parfois \u00eatre maintenues. Voyez-en des exemples dans Cass., 5 juillet 1858, D. 58, 1. 385 S. 58. 1. 557; Cass., 10 juillet 1860, D. 60, 1, 454, S. 60. 1. 708; Cass., 17 novembre 1880, D. 81, 1. 180, S. 81. 1. 249.\nLa Cour de Cassation en France, re: affaire DeJenteville & Rivet, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 (voir Dalloz, 81.1.80):\nAttendu que l'ensemble de l'\u00e9crit litigieux autorisait un doute \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard; \u2014que d\u00e8s lors il appartenait aux juges du fait de d\u00e9cider la question d'apr\u00e8s l'interpr\u00e9tation que leur para\u00eetraient commander les termes de l'\u00e9crit et les circonstances extrins\u00e8ques de la cause.\nL'intim\u00e9e nous a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat re: Dempsey v. Lawson 12:\nEven if the second instrument contains a general revocatory clause, that is not conclusive, and the Court will, notwithstanding, consider whether it was the intention of the testator to revoke a bequest contained in a previous will: Denny v. Barton. On the other hand, though there be no express revocatory clause, the question is whether the intention of the testator, to be collected from the instrument, was that the dispositions of the earlier will should remain in whole or in part operative. Dr. Lushington, in giving the judgment of the Privy Council in Henfrey v. Henfrey, says: \"the question is total revocation or partial revocation\". And on this question Sir J. Nicoll says, in Methuen v. Methuen, \"In the Court of Probate the whole question is one of intention; the animus testandi and the animus revocandi are completely open to investigation in this Court.'\nDe m\u00eame, re Erskine 13:\nA subsequent testamentary paper does not necessarily revoke one prior in date, even though the second instrument contains a general revocatory clause. The intention of the testator is the sole guide in the matter, and the intention to be discovered is that relating to the disposition of the testator's property, and not to the form of the will. A will is not necessarily confined to one document, but may be contained in several documents. When executed by a soldier after it had been prepared by his solicitor is not revoked by a will made three days later, on a form supplied by the military authorities, which contained a clause revoking generally all former wills. The dispositon of the property was the same in both wills and both documents were admitted to probate.\nDans la cause de Girouard & Durocher 14, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que:\n\u2026le moyen le plus s\u00fbr de d\u00e9terminer l'intention d'un testateur et de fixer le sens qu'il a entendu donner \u00e0 ses dispositions testamentaires, est de s'attacher \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation que les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es ont faite de l'acte, et par la mani\u00e8re dont elles l'ont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9.\nOr, ici, les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, en vertu du second testament, ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 par leur long silence et leur inaction durant plusieurs ann\u00e9es qu'ils ne comprenaient pas que le testament de 1939 n'entendait pas inclure la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 occup\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e. Ils n'y ont jamais \u00e9mis la moindre pr\u00e9tention jusqu'\u00e0 l'acte de vente qu'ils ont consenti \u00e0 l'appelant et, par cons\u00e9quent, plus de neuf ans apr\u00e8s le testament de 1939. L'un des points les plus significatifs de l'interpr\u00e9tation qu'ils ont donn\u00e9e au testament est que c'est seulement le 2 juin 1945, soit six ans apr\u00e8s le testament, que pour la premi\u00e8re fois ils ont fait enregistrer une d\u00e9claration de transmission de biens mentionnant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Lauzon.\nUn autre fait, peut-\u00eatre encore plus significatif, pour d\u00e9terminer l'intention du testateur est le suivant : Lorsque Arthur Guay fit son premier testament, il le fit lire solennellement en pr\u00e9sence de Wilfrid Guay et de sa famille. Or, en premier lieu, un testament n'a jamais d'existence l\u00e9gale avant la mort du testateur; mais, en second lieu, pour quiconque est au courant des coutumes et des habitudes de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, l'on sait que, jusqu'\u00e0 la mort du testateur, le testament est cens\u00e9 demeurer secret et il est tout \u00e0 fait inusit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 en faire la lecture en pr\u00e9sence des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 et sign\u00e9. Il m'est impossible de voir, dans la fa\u00e7on dont on a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 ici, autre chose qu'une indication bien arr\u00eat\u00e9e de la part de Arthur Guay que son intention \u00e9tait, d\u00e8s ce moment-l\u00e0, de transmettre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Wilfrid Guay, et que, d\u00e8s lors, il s'en consid\u00e9rait comme d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit. La cons\u00e9quence serait donc que, lorsqu'il a fait le testament de 1939, il \u00e9tait bien convaincu que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Lauzon ne faisait plus partie de son domaine et que, par ce testament de 1939, il n'avait aucunement l'intention, en employant des termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, d'y comprendre cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nMais il me para\u00eet inutile d'entrer ici dans tous les d\u00e9tails des circonstances qui d\u00e9montrent bien que le testateur consid\u00e9rait avoir accompli tout ce qui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour transf\u00e9rer cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Wilfrid Guay et que, lors de son testament de 1939, il n'envisageait nullement l'obligation d'en faire mention ou la possibilit\u00e9 que son second testament put \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme incluant cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nSur ce point, je suis compl\u00e8tement d'accord avec les raisons donn\u00e9es par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) \u00e0 l'appui du jugement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu. Et cela me para\u00eet suffisant pour maintenir ce jugement et pour rejeter l'appel.\nJe ne veux pas dire par l\u00e0 que les autres moyens auxquels se sont rattach\u00e9s quatre des juges de cette Cour ne constituent pas non plus des moyens s\u00e9rieux \u00e0 l'encontre du succ\u00e8s de l'appelant, mais je ne crois pas n\u00e9cessaire de les \u00e9laborer ici, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j'en arrive sur ce premier moyen que je consid\u00e8re d\u00e9cisif.\nJe suis donc d'avis de maintenir le jugement dont est appel et que cet appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, avec d\u00e9pens.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and of Fauteux JJ. was delivered by Taschereau J.:\u2014Le demandeur-appelant a institu\u00e9 contre la d\u00e9fenderesse-intim\u00e9e des proc\u00e9dures en saisie-gagerie.\nIl all\u00e8gue en substance que depuis le 13 d\u00e9cembre 1948, il est propri\u00e9taire d'un immeuble situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Lauzon (P.Q.), qu'il a achet\u00e9 du Monongahela Trust Company de Homestead, Pennsylvanie, pour le prix de $2,000.00 pay\u00e9 comptant. Au moment de cet achat, la d\u00e9fenderesse habitait cette maison, et le demandeur l'a imm\u00e9diatement avis\u00e9e d'avoir \u00e0 payer le prix et la valeur de son occupation, que la Commission des prix et du commerce en temps de guerre a fix\u00e9 \u00e0 $50.00 par mois.\nA cette action, la d\u00e9fenderesse a plaid\u00e9, apr\u00e8s avoir ni\u00e9 le pouvoir du Monongahela Trust de vendre cet immeuble \u00e0 l'appelant, qu'elle est avec ses enfants, l'h\u00e9riti\u00e8re de son mari Wilfrid Guay, d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 ab intestat, et que la maison qu'elle habite faisait partie de son patrimoine. Elle invoque un testament fait \u00e0 Lauzon par Arthur Bonaparte Guay, oncle de son mari, devant Lagueux, N.P., le 27 ao\u00fbt 1937, dans lequel il l\u00e9guait \u00e0 son neveu tous les biens qu'il poss\u00e9dait au Canada. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l'action, mais la Cour d'Appel 15 l'a rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nLa preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'Arthur Bonaparte Guay, oncle du mari de l'intim\u00e9e, vivait aux Etats-Unis, mais qu'il est revenu \u00e0 Lauzon chez son neveu, qui \u00e9tait son seul parent, en 1934, et qu'il est revenu de nouveau en 1937. Le 27 ao\u00fbt 1937, devant Joseph Lagueux, notaire, Arthur Bonaparte Guay a achet\u00e9 l'immeuble en question pour le prix de $3,042.00, et \u00e0 la m\u00eame date, devant le m\u00eame notaire, il a fait un testament notari\u00e9 dans lequel il dit:\nJe donne et l\u00e8gue tous les biens meubles et immeubles sans aucune exception) que je d\u00e9laisserai en Canada au jour de mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 mon neveu, Wilfrid Guay lequel je nomme mon l\u00e9gataire universel et mon ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, voulant et ordonnant que tous les biens que je l\u00e8gue ainsi au dit Wilfrid Guay lui soient propres et insaisissables quant \u00e0 toutes les dettes qu'il pourra devoir au jour de mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nCe legs est fait \u00e0 la charge par le dit Wilfrid Guay de pourvoir \u00e0 mes obs\u00e8ques et fun\u00e9railles si je d\u00e9c\u00e8de en Canada, et de me faire chanter deux services dont l'un au jour de l'inhumation de mon corps et l'autre \u00e0 l'anniversaire de mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s. L'immeuble l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e9tait le seul bien que le testateur laissait au Canada, et dont la d\u00e9fenderesse pr\u00e9tend avoir h\u00e9rit\u00e9 avec ses enfants, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son mari.\nA la date o\u00f9 il a ainsi fait son testament, Arthur Bonaparte Guay a remis \u00e0 son neveu une copie de son testament, l'a fait lire \u00e0 la famille qui \u00e9tait r\u00e9unie dans la maison, lui remit \u00e9galement une copie d'acte d'achat de la maison ainsi que les certificats d'enregistrement. Il est revenu au pays en 1938 et en 1939 comme invit\u00e9 de son neveu. Les taxes \u00e9taient pay\u00e9es par le neveu, et \u00e0 l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de la premi\u00e8re police d'assurance, celle-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9e avec perte payable au neveu. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que depuis l'achat de la maison, ce dernier en a eu la jouissance la plus compl\u00e8te, et a agi toujours avec le consentement de son oncle, comme s'il en \u00e9tait v\u00e9ritablement le propri\u00e9taire.\nEn d\u00e9cembre 1939, Arthur Bonaparte Guay a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 un officier du Monongahela Trust Company de lui pr\u00e9parer un testament. Ce dernier s'est adress\u00e9 \u00e0 un avocat am\u00e9ricain qui a r\u00e9dig\u00e9, hors la pr\u00e9sence de Guay, un testament que ce dernier a sign\u00e9 le 6 d\u00e9cembre 1939. Dans ce testament, fait suivant la forme d\u00e9riv\u00e9e de la loi d'Angleterre, Guay d\u00e9clare r\u00e9voquer tous testaments ant\u00e9rieurs qu'il aurait pu faire, et apr\u00e8s avoir consenti quelques legs particuliers, il donne le r\u00e9sidu de ses biens \u00e0 certains parents de sa femme, ant\u00e9rieurement d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e. Il nomme le Monongahela Trust Company de Homestead, Pennsylvanie, ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, et l'autorise \u00e0 vendre ses biens mobiliers et immobiliers aux prix et conditions qu'il pourrait d\u00e9terminer.\nLa premi\u00e8re question qui se pose est de savoir si le testament fait aux \u00c9tats-Unis en 1939, r\u00e9voque le testament fait \u00e0 Lauzon en 1937, et par lequel la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 occup\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fenderesse-intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait donn\u00e9e au neveu du testateur. S'il faut en arriver \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il n'y a pas de semblable r\u00e9vocation, alors le mari de l'intim\u00e9e, malgr\u00e9 le testament am\u00e9ricain, se trouve \u00e0 avoir h\u00e9rit\u00e9 de l'immeuble en question, et le pr\u00e9sent appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, sans qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire d'examiner si le Monongahela Trust pouvait consentir une vente valide \u00e0 l'appelant. Un testament peut \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 de diverses fa\u00e7ons, entre autres, par un testament post\u00e9rieur qui le r\u00e9voque express\u00e9ment, ou qui le r\u00e9voque par la nature de ses dispositions (892 C.C.). La r\u00e9vocation par un testateur est expresse, par exemple, quand elle r\u00e9sulte de la confection d'un nouveau testament o\u00f9 il est dit que le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent testament ou telle disposition du pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent testament sera r\u00e9voqu\u00e9, mais il arrive qu'une r\u00e9vocation en des termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, comme dans le cas qui nous occupe, ne signifie pas n\u00e9cessairement que le premier testament soit r\u00e9voqu\u00e9. Il se peut que ce soit l'intention du testateur de maintenir les deux testaments s'il n'y a pas d'incompatibilit\u00e9. Comme le dit Planiol (Trait\u00e9 \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire de Droit Civil, 8e \u00e9d., Vol. 3, page 709:\nMalgr\u00e9 leurs formules absolues, par lesquelles les testateurs d\u00e9clarent r\u00e9voquer toutes les dispositions ant\u00e9rieures, les r\u00e9vocations expresses sont susceptibles d'\u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es, et certaines dispositions de date plus ancienne peuvent parfois \u00eatre maintenues.\nDans Dempsey v. Lawson 16, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9:\nEven if the second instrument contains a general revocatory clause, that is not conclusive, and the Court will, notwithstanding, consider whether it was the intention of the testator to revoke a bequest contained in a previous will: Denny v. Barton. On the other hand, though there be no express revocatory clause, the question is whether the intention of the testator, to be collected from the instrument, was that the dispositions of the earlier will should remain in whole or in part operative.\nDans Re Erskine 17:\nA subsequent testamentary paper does not necessarily revoke one prior in date, even though the second instrument contains a general revocatory clause. The intention of the testator is the sole guide in the matter, and the intention to be discovered is that relating to the disposition of the testator's property, and not to the form of the will. A will is not necessarily confined to one document, but may be contained in several documents.\nIn the Estate of O'Connor, Deceased 18, on lit ce qui suit:\nIn order to ascertain the intention of the deceased as to what shall operate and compose his or her will, it is permissible to examine all the circumstances of the case. They must, however, be circumstances existing at the time when the will was made.\nCertes, c'est dans le testament lui-m\u00eame que doit \u00eatre recherch\u00e9e l'intention du testateur, mais commes il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit dans Re Hammond 19, il y a des cas o\u00f9 l'on peut s'ins- pirer aussi des circonstances particuli\u00e8res pour trouver ce que le testateur a v\u00e9ritablement voulu. Pour employer l'expression classique, il est alors permis de se placer dans \"l'arm chair\" du testateur, et de consid\u00e9rer les circonstances qui l'entouraient quand il a fait son testament.\nIl s'agit bien de l'un de ces cas dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, et il importe donc de se demander si le de cujus, quand il a fait son testament am\u00e9ricain, avait bien l\u2019animus revocandi, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'intention de r\u00e9voquer le testament canadien de 1937.\nIl est clair que deux testaments peuvent exister simultan\u00e9ment lorsqu'ils affectent des biens diff\u00e9rents, et qu'il appert qu'une clause de r\u00e9vocation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dans le second ne porte pas sur les biens l\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans le premier. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, il me semble bien \u00e9vident que quand le testateur a sign\u00e9 son premier testament devant Lagueux, N.P., en 1937, il avait l'intention clairement exprim\u00e9e, de ne l\u00e9guer \u00e0 son neveu que les biens qu'il poss\u00e9dait au Canada, et dont il \u00e9tait devenu propri\u00e9taire le jour m\u00eame par acte de vente que lui avaient consenti Antonio Beau-doin Labrecque et al. Voulant \u00e9tablir son neveu non fortun\u00e9, qui \u00e9tait le dernier parent qu'il avait au Canada, il lui remit tous les titres ainsi que la possession de l'immeuble, et je n'ai aucun doute, comme le dit M. le Juge en chef Galipeault, que quand l'oncle, peu vers\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9dale des lois, est parti pour les \u00c9tats-Unis en 1939, pour ne plus jamais revenir, pour lui, \"tout \u00e9tait fini, tout \u00e9tait r\u00e9gl\u00e9, bien d\u00e9finitivement\", en ce qui concerne cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Lauzon. Il en avait bien dispos\u00e9 en faveur de son neveu. Il ne se pr\u00e9occupera plus de son entretien, du paiement des taxes, ou du maintien en force des assurances. C'est le neveu qui s'occupera de tout cela, car c'est lui qui effectivement est devenu le propri\u00e9taire pour toutes fins pratiques.\nQuant \u00e0 Homestead en 1939, Bonaparte Guay d\u00e9cide de faire un autre testament et qu'il s'adresse au g\u00e9rant du Monongahela Trust, il ne fait pas de doute qu'il avait pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 l'esprit les faits qui venaient de se passer \u00e0 Lauzon, et qu'il n'a jamais eu l'intention de d\u00e9sh\u00e9riter son neveu. La clause de r\u00e9vocation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, qui est tr\u00e8s souvent \"une clause de style\", ne me para\u00eet pas affecter le testament canadien. Par ce second testament am\u00e9ricain, Bonaparte Guay nomme le Monongahela Trust, compagnie \u00e9trang\u00e8re, non enregistr\u00e9e dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et par cons\u00e9quent incapable d'agir l\u00e9galement, administrateur de ses biens et, tuteur aux enfants mineurs nomm\u00e9s dans le testament. Il l\u00e8gue un immeuble situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Dormont, Pennsylvanie, \u00e0 mademoiselle Bessie Graner, fait quelques legs particuliers en argent, et donne le r\u00e9sidu de ses biens \u00e0 des parents de sa femme d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e, sans cependant sp\u00e9cifier ceux situ\u00e9s en pays \u00e9tranger. Il n'est nullement question de l'immeuble de Lauzon, et m\u00eame l'aviseur financier du de cujus depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, le g\u00e9rant du Monongahela Trust, M. McClure, qui a demand\u00e9 pour ce dernier la v\u00e9rification du testament et les lettres d'administration, d\u00e9clare quelques mois apr\u00e8s la mort de Bonaparte Guay, que tous les biens sont situ\u00e9s \u00e0 West Homestead, Pennsylvanie.\nBonaparte Guay est mort le 12 juin 1941, et Wilfrid Guay, le neveu, le 23 octobre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. Ce n'est que plus tard que l'on a appris \u00e0 Lauzon le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de l'oncle, et ce n'est qu'en 1945 que le Monongahela Trust a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'immeuble. Je ne vois entre le testament canadien et le testament am\u00e9ricain aucune incompatibilit\u00e9. Dans le premier, c'est un legs fait \u00e0 Wilfrid Guay des biens canadiens; dans le second, c'est un legs aux parents de sa femme, de certains biens qui ne peuvent \u00eatre autres que les biens situ\u00e9s aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Il faut, je crois, donner effet aux deux testaments, et c'est comme cela qu'il faut fixer, je pense, le sens que le testateur a entendu lui-m\u00eame donner \u00e0 ses dispositions.\nIl r\u00e9sulte que Wilfrid Guay a h\u00e9rit\u00e9 de l'immeuble de Lauzon lors de la mort de son oncle Bonaparte Guay, et que l'intim\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, ayant h\u00e9rit\u00e9 de son mari conjointement avec ses enfants, est propri\u00e9taire d\u00e9finitive de cet immeuble, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours.\nThe judgment of Rand and of Kellock JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014This action was brought by the appellant as owner of land in Quebec claiming rent. Two questions are raised: one, whether a will devising the land, made in that province, was revoked by a later will made in Pennsylvania; and the other, whether an instrument purporting to convey the land to the appellant executed in Quebec by a trust company incorporated in Pennsylvania as executor under a power of sale conferred by the second will, is valid.\nThe first will, made in 1937 in notarial form, devised to the deceased husband of the respondent all of the moveables and immoveables without exception which the testator might possess in Canada at the time of his death. The testator had been born in Quebec but had long since made his home in the United States. Two years later, in 1939, the Pennsylvania testament was made in which, after disposing of his residence there and making several pecuniary bequests, he left the \"rest, residue and remainder\" of his property to certain relatives of his deceased wife in that state. The opening paragraph, after declaring the instrument to be his last will and testament, proceeds, \"hereby revoking any and all former wills made by me.\" The important question of law can at once be seen to be whether that general revocation is, in the circumstances, to be taken to have included the will of 1937.\nThe second question arises from the fact that by art. 365 of the Civil Code of Quebec a corporation is declared incompetent to be entrusted with the execution of testaments. This has been qualified by chap. 284 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1941, which deals with trust companies, provincial, dominion and foreign, and which provides for the authorization of a foreign company of that character to carry on business in the province, provided it obtain a certificate of registration. That certificate can issue only on terms and conditions fixed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. The doing of business would include acting as testamentary executor. Mr. Pigeon suggests we should treat art. 365 as impliedly repealed by the statute but that, obviously, could not be done. Keeping in mind the article and the object of the statute, the incapacity applies to any juristic act done in the province as executor. The trust company was disabled, therefore, from selling or joining in the deed of sale in this case unless it was then the holder of a certificate; registration is a condition precedent to such an act, and as no certificate has been granted, the result is that the title upon which the plaintiff in the action relies is fatally defective.\nThat being so, it is unnecessary to deal with the first question, which is one of importance and of difficulty. In such a matter the Court should have before it the fullest detail of material that might connect the testator's mind with the clause, but that unfortunately is not the situation here; and where, in any event, the action must be dismissed, we should not go beyond the necessities of the case. That issue then is to be taken as unaffected by the judgment and as free for such determination in other proceedings as the parties may see fit to seek.\nThe appeal must therefore be dismissed on the ground mentioned, with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Germain, Pigeon and Thibodeau.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

The latter became suspicious and went into a service station in Chatham to phone the police, but appellant accompanied him and he was unable to do so. He made another attempt at a service station in London and succeeded in lifting the telephone receiver and asking for the police. Appellant, who had accompanied him, produced a Colt revolver and ordered everyone into the grease-pit at the rear of the station. The taxi driver escaped through a doorway slamming a wooden door behind him. A bullet discharged from appellant\u2019s gun passed through the doorway killing a person whose presence was unknown to appellant. It was contended by appellant that the gun was discharged accidentally when he slipped on the floor, and that the trial judge was wrong when he charged that appellant was, after leaving Windsor, fleeing from lawful apprehension since there being no pursuer, it could not be said that he was pursued and, therefore, in flight.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting), that the appeal should be dismissed as the trial judge was justified in leaving it to the jury to find whether the accused was in flight \u201cupon\u201d (meaning after) the Windsor robbery, even though there was as yet no pursuit. It is sufficient that the pursuit be apprehended and, therefore, the matter of the flight may be subjective so far as the offender is concerned.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming appellant\u2019s conviction for murder.\nW.R. Poole for the appellant.\nW.B. Common K.C. and C.C. Savage K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.:\u2014The appellant and one Bechard were jointly indicted and tried on a charge that on November 20, 1950, at London, Ontario, they murdered Clare Galbraith. Bechard was acquitted but Rowe was convicted and his conviction was affirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. He was given leave to appeal to this Court from that affirmance on two points of law, the first of which is:\u2014\nDid the learned trial judge err in his charge to the jury when he stated that the appellant after leaving Windsor was fleeing from lawful apprehension, thus bringing into operation Section 260(d) of the Criminal Code?\nRowe testified that a Colt revolver (Exhibit 13) had been taken by him from his boarding house in Detroit, Michigan, with the permission of the landlady\u2019s son. On November 20, 1950, Rowe and Bechard, who had boarded at the same place, came to Windsor, Ontario. About 2 p.m. Rowe telephoned a Mrs. Brown in Windsor, the wife of a friend, inquiring if her husband was at home. He was advised that the husband was at work and would not be home until 6 p.m. Rowe knew that Brown had in his possession three automatics and a Colt pistol, and there was some discussion between Rowe and Bechard as to securing these in order to procure funds. About 2.45 p.m. Bechard, armed with Exhibit 13, forced Mrs. Brown into the basement where he tied and gagged her. She heard another man moving around on the floor above, and in fact Rowe admitted that he and Bechard stole the automatics and pistol with the intention of selling them. After Mrs. Brown had freed herself, she found that the telephone wires to her house had been cut.\nAbout 3.30 p.m., John Jolly, an independent taxi owner stationed at the Prince Edward Hotel in Windsor, about two miles distant from the Brown home, was approached by Bechard and requested to drive Rowe and himself to London. Jolly was told that neither man had funds but he was promised payment upon completion of the trip.\nWhile en route from Windsor to London, Jolly became suspicious because of the conversation between Rowe and Bechard and stopped at a service station at Chatham with the intention of telephoning police. However, Rowe accompanied him and he was unable to carry out his intention. Upon reaching London, on his own initiative, Jolly stopped at a service station and was again accompanied by Rowe. The latter instructed Jolly to proceed to a certain address, which, however, could not be located. By this time Jolly had become even more alarmed and suspicious and drove into another gasoline station. Rowe and Jolly proceeded into the office where Rowe consulted a telephone directory and stated he had discovered the London address he wanted. Jolly noticed that the telephone directory was opened at \u201cZurich\u201d, a municipality some distance outside of London. Jolly\u2019s suspicion that the trip was \u201cnot legitimate\u201d was then confirmed and he lifted the telephone receiver and asked the operator to get the police. Upon hearing Jolly\u2019s request, Rowe immediately pulled out Exhibit 13, which had been returned to him by Bechard after the Brown robbery, and calling to those present \u201cThis is a stick up\u201d or \u201cEverybody in the back\u201d, he ordered them into the rear of the service station. Jolly and others were herded into the grease pit room. Rowe ordered Jolly to stop and not go on with the others. Jolly hesitated a moment and then ran through a doorway, through a small connecting room, and through an open doorway into the wash rack room, slamming a wooden door behind him. While Rowe was in the grease pit room with Exhibit 13 in his hand, a bullet was discharged from it, passing through the wooden door that Jolly had closed and killing Galbraith, whose presence was unknown to Rowe. Rowe\u2019s evidence was that he slipped on the floor, thus causing the bullet to be discharged, but that he had no intention of pulling the trigger. While there is other evidence that Rowe was seen to pull back the hammer of the gun and that two distinct clicks accompanying the movement were heard, the point is unimportant in view of the only problem before us under the first question, which concerns section 260 of the Criminal Code, and particularly the opening clause and 260(d) as enacted by sections 6 and 7 of chapter 55 of the 1947 Statutes.\nBefore referring to section 260, it should be added that Rowe\u2019s evidence was that he intended to proceed to Toronto to seek a reconciliation with his wife and that Bechard also intended to go to Toronto to commence divorce proceedings against his wife; that he (Rowe) intended to sell the five weapons and from the proceeds give Bechard $75 and pay Jolly $50 for his trip from Windsor to London and return, using any balance to proceed by bus to Toronto; that he spent fifteen minutes in an unsuccessful endeavour to locate a purchaser of the weapons in Windsor; that he proposed to make a sale at any available pool room in London; that he hired a cab, rather than take other means of transportation, in order to arrive in London before the closing of the pool rooms in that city,\u2014although he did not know at what time the pool rooms closed; that he had passed through London previously but had never tarried there.\nSection 260 as amended in 1947 reads as follows:\u2014\n260. In case of treason and the other offences against the King\u2019s authority and person mentioned in Part II, piracy and offences deemed to be piracy, escape or rescue from prison or lawful custody, resisting lawful apprehension, murder, rape, indecent assault, forcible abduction, robbery, burglary or arson, culpable homicide is also murder, whether the offender means or not death to ensue, or knows or not that death is likely to ensue.\n(a) if he means to inflict grievous bodily injury for the purpose of facilitating the commission of any of the offences in this section mentioned, or the flight of the offender upon the commission or attempted commission thereof, and death ensues from such injury; or (b) if he administers any stupefying or overpowering thing for either of the purposes aforesaid, and death ensues from the effects thereof; or\n(c) if he, by any means wilfully stops the breath of any person for either of the purposes aforesaid, and death ensues from such stopping of the breath.\n(d) if he uses or has upon his person any weapon during or at the time of the commission or attempted commission by him of any of the offences in this section mentioned or the flight of the offender upon the commission or attempted commission thereof, and death ensues as a consequence of its use.\nOne of the offences mentioned in the opening paragraph, \u201crobbery\u201d, had been committed by Rowe at the Brown house in Windsor. The contention that he did not use Exhibit 13 at the London service station and that Galbraith\u2019s death did not ensue as a consequence of its use cannot be sustained. Section 260(d) was enacted as a result of the decision in Hughes v. The King[1], and its provisions are met in this case by the facts that Rowe not only had the Colt upon his person but pulled it out and held it in his hand. That was a use, under any definition of that very ordinary word, and the death of Galbraith ensued as a consequence.\nPart of the Crown\u2019s case was that Rowe committed, or attempted to commit, robbery at London, and the jury were charged accordingly, but it was also put to the jury, in accordance with another submission of the Crown, that Rowe was in flight upon the commission of the Windsor robbery and the most serious attack was made upon those portions of the charge to the jury dealing with that matter. In argument before us, circumstances were imagined where it was said that there could be no flight but it is sufficient for this appeal to decide that there was evidence upon which the jury, to whom it was left as a matter of fact, could decide that Rowe was in flight upon (which means after) the Windsor robbery. The time element is of importance. About 2.45 p.m. the robbery took place; fifteen minutes, according to Rowe, were spent in an endeavour to locate a purchaser of the weapons; about 3.30 Jolly was engaged for the trip to London, and he was never left alone by Rowe. Rowe had only passed through London and was not familiar with the city, although according to his story he intended to dispose of the weapons at a pool room. It was contended that there was no evidence that the police had ever been notified of the Windsor robbery and that, there being no pursuer, it could not be said that Rowe was pursued and, therefore, in flight. That contention is unsound. The whole matter was subjective so far as Rowe was concerned. He knew that he had committed a robbery at Brown\u2019s house; he was anxious to dispose of the weapons taken from that house; he spent only fifteen minutes endeavouring to find a purchaser in Windsor; it was Bechard who made the arrangements with the taxi driver but it was Rowe, who had not been seen by Mrs. Brown, who identified himself to Jolly when the latter was raising a question as to being paid for the trip to London. Rowe never let Jolly out of his sight, and coupled with this are the circumstances under which he pulled out Exhibit 13. The trial judge was correct in leaving it to the jury to find whether Rowe was in flight.\nThe second point upon which leave to appeal was given is this:\u2014\nDid the learned trial judge err in allowing the admission of Exhibit 23 as evidence in the case, and in allowing also all other evidence in connection with the crime committed in Windsor?\nAt the trial, a very short extract from a statement previously made by Bechard was put in evidence as against him by the Crown in order to show his connection with Exhibit 13. Later, at the instigation of Bechard\u2019s counsel, the whole of the statement was admitted as Exhibit 23 but it was made clear to the jury that the extract and the entire statement were evidence only against Bechard and not as against Rowe. The trial judge having ruled that Bechard\u2019s statement was voluntary and having permitted Crown counsel to put in as evidence the short extract referred to, it was quite proper that the judge should later permit the whole of the statement to be admitted at the request of counsel for Bechard. The latter was one of the accused and was entitled to have the whole of the statement go in so that the jury might have before it everything that had been said by him. This is not a case where an accused seeks to put in evidence in chief a statement made by him on some previous occasion, whether to a police officer or not, and the decisions cited in connection with that class of case are inapplicable.\nThe appeal must be dismissed.\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014Put shortly, the question with respect to which leave to appeal was granted and which remains undisposed of, is whether or not there was any evidence of flight with respect to the robbery in Windsor so as to render applicable s. 260(d) of the Code.\nThe section provides that, in the case of certain offences including robbery, culpable homicide is also murder, whether the offender means or not death to ensue, or knows or not that death is likely to ensue,\n(d) if he uses or has upon his person any weapon during or at the time of the commission or attempted commission by him of any of the offences in this section mentioned, or the flight of the offender upon the commission or attempted commission thereof, and death ensues as a consequence of its use.\nOn behalf of the Crown it was argued that the length of time between the commission of the crime in respect of which the flight occurs, and the death, is immaterial if the offender in the interim is evading arrest. On the other hand, the appellant contended that before there can be any flight within the meaning of the paragraph, there must, at the least, be an attempt to apprehend. In other words, it is said that flight involves pursuit, and if there be no pursuit in fact, there can be no flight within the meaning of this legislation.\nIn my opinion, neither of these contentions ought to be accepted. As to the Crown\u2019s contention, I think it is too wide. On the other hand, it has been often pointed out that \u201cthe wicked flee when no man pursueth.\u201d One of the ordinary meanings of the word \u201cflight\u201d is the \u201caction of running away from danger,\u201d and I think the danger (in such a case as the present, danger of loss of liberty) may be apprehended as well as present and actual. In other words, the subjective element in any case may be sufficient.\nIn The Queen v. Humphery[2], Tindal C.J. said, with relation to the use of the word \u201cupon\u201d in statutes, at p. 370, that it may undoubtedly either mean before the act done to which it relates, or simultaneous with the act done, or after the act done, according as reason and good sense require the interpretation, with reference to the context, and subject matter of the enactment.\nThe Oxford Dictionary gives as one of the meanings of the word, \u201cfollowing upon\u201d as well as \u201cimmediately after.\u201d The French text of the statute here in question reads\n. . . ou au cours ou au moment de la fuite du d\u00e9linquant apr\u00e8s la perpetration . . .\nIn the present instance, \u201cupon\u201d cannot be given the meaning of either before or simultaneously with the commission of the offence, and as the word \u201cimmediately\u201d is not used in the statute, I think \u201cupon\u201d should be interpreted in the sense of \u201cfollowing.\u201d The question as to whether or not in a given case flight exists is, of course, a question of fact.\nIn the case at bar, I think the circumstances, which I do not repeat, are sufficient to have enabled the jury, if they saw fit, to find that the appellant, at the time the fatal shot was fired, was in flight upon the commission of the Windsor robbery within the meaning of the statute. The fact that the jury might also have concluded that he and his companion had a new venture in mind involving the sale of the guns or their use in another way to obtain money, did not preclude the jury from taking such a view.\nIn these circumstances, I would dismiss the appeal. I should like to add that, in my view, we are indebted to Mr. Poole for his argument in this case, and the way in which all difficulties were frankly faced.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal, pursuant to leave granted by my brother Taschereau, from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on February 22, 1951, affirming the conviction of the appellant on a charge of murdering one Clare Galbraiith.\nThe relevant facts are stated, and section 260 of the Criminal Code is set out, in the judgment of my brother Kerwin and it is not necessary to repeat them. I find it necessary to consider only the first point upon which leave to appeal was granted which was as follows:\u2014\nFirst, did the learned trial judge err in his charge to the jury when he stated that the appellant after leaving Windsor was fleeing from lawful apprehension, thus bringing into operation section 260(d) of the Criminal Code?\nOn the evidence it was open to the jury to find (i) that the discharge of the revolver which killed Galbraith was accidental, in the sense that it was not discharged by any act of Rowe\u2019s done with the intention of discharging it but resulted from his slipping on the floor of the grease-pit room, and (ii) that in the service station at London, where Galbraith was shot, Rowe was neither committing nor attempting to commit any of the offences mentioned in section 260 of the Criminal Code. If the jury did find the facts to be as set out in (i) and (ii) then what moved them to convict Rowe of murder instead of manslaughter must, I think, have been a finding that he was using the revolver during or at the time of his flight upon the commission of the robbery in which he had taken part in Windsor.\nOn a careful reading of the whole charge I think it clear that the learned trial judge instructed the jury that it was open to them to find that at the moment of the discharge of the revolver the appellant was in flight from the commission of the robbery in Windsor and that if they did so find then as a matter of law, even if they concluded that the discharge of the revolver was accidental in the sense above mentioned, it was their duty to convict the appellant of murder rather than manslaughter. I refer particularly to the following passages in the charge of the learned trial judge:\nNow, does that indicate to you that these men were still in flight from Windsor, that they were getting away from the police following that robbery in Windsor? It is for you to say, gentlemen of the jury, whether they were in flight or not, because if they were in flight from the robbery, if their flight had not been discontinued, if there had not been a termination of it, then they come right within that amendment of the Code which I gave to you a few minutes ago.\n* * *\nYou have to look at it this way, that in the case of manslaughter the unlawful act must not be such as the offender knew or ought to have known was likely to cause death. It must not be any of the acts I have described as murder. Therefore, if you find that Rowe did not mean to cause death, or if you have a reasonable doubt about it, or if you find he did not mean to cause to the person killed bodily injury which he knew was likely to cause death and that he was reckless as to whether death ensued or not, and if you find he did not mean to cause death or bodily injury to Jolly or knew that he was likely to cause death to Jolly, and in addition to that, if you find there was no flight, and if you find there was no attempted robbery, or if you have a reasonable doubt about these things, and you merely find he was pointing that gun and while he was pointing the gun it went off by accident, you would be justified in bringing in a verdict against Rowe of manslaughter, but you have to eliminate all these things that are murder. If you merely find he was not robbing or fleeing from lawful apprehension, that he was merely pointing a gun and the gun went off by accident, as he says, then he would be only guilty of manslaughter. If he has even raised a reasonable doubt in your mind about these items of murder, you would be entitled to make such a finding.\n* * *\nI say, as I told you this afternoon, if you say that they were not, when they got to London, escaping from lawful apprehension, if you can say they were not attempting a robbery, if you can say that he shot at Jolly without intending to cause any fatal harm, then you get down to where he was committing an offence, and did not intend to cause death, then you are in the realm of manslaughter. But before you are in the realm of manslaughter you must be able to get rid of the crime of flight and of robbery in London, and the attempt to cause bodily injury to Jolly, which was likely to cause death.\n* * *\nAll I want to emphasize to you, gentlemen of the jury, is that before you get to manslaughter at all in this case you have to eliminate all those items which would be murder.\nThere is no evidence in the record that at the time of the discharge of the revolver the police in Windsor or anywhere else, or indeed anyone other than Rowe and his accomplice Bechard, knew that the appellant had taken part in the robbery in Windsor. Mrs. Brown, the victim of the robbery, had not seen Rowe and there is no evidence that she had any idea of the identity of Bechard. She had seen Bechard during the robbery and was able to identify him some days later in a police line-up but prior to the robbery he was a stranger to her. There is no evidence that any pursuit of Rowe and Bechard as a result of the robbery at Windsor ever commenced.\nIt seems to me that the question which we have to decide is whether, in this state of the evidence, as a matter of law on a proper construction of section 260 of the Criminal Code it was open to the jury to find that the discharge of the revolver occurred during or at the time of the flight of Rowe upon the commission of the robbery in Windsor, within the meaning of those words as used in clause (d) of the section.\nIt is, I think, of assistance to consider the state of the law immediately prior to the amendment. The common law is, I think, correctly stated in the following passage in Archbold\u2019s Criminal Pleading, 32nd Edition (1949) page 910:\u2014\nIf a person, while in the act of committing a felony involving violence, e.g., rape, kills another without having the intention of so doing, the killing is murder. A person who uses violent measures in the commission of a felony involving personal violence does so at his own risk and is guilty of murder if those measures result, even inadvertently, in the death of the victim. For this purpose, the use of a loaded firearm in order to frighten the victim into submission is a violent measure. If the act is unlawful but does not amount to felony, the killing, generally speaking, is manslaughter.\nThe common law in this regard was carried in a somewhat modified form into section 260 of the Criminal Code as it read prior to the 1947 amendment. For felonies involving violence Parliament substituted the offences enumerated in the opening words of the section and, where the offender neither meant death to ensue nor knew that it was likely to ensue as a result of his conduct, required as a condition of his conviction of murder proof either of the intention to inflict grievous bodily harm or of the administration of a stupefying or overpowering thing or of the stopping of the breath of a person, for the purpose, in each case, of facilitating the commission of one of the specified offences or the flight of the offender upon the commission or attempted commission thereof.\nIn this state of the law The King v. Hughes[3] was decided, the unanimous judgment of this court being delivered by Sir Lyman Duff, C.J.C. We are, of course, bound by that judgment except in so far as its effect may have been abrogated or modified by the amendment referred to. It appears to me to have decided that when an accused, who is in the course of committing a robbery accompanied by violence, is using a pistol and such pistol is discharged during a struggle and the death of another person is caused thereby and there is some evidence that such discharge was accidental, the trial judge must instruct the jury that if they reach the conclusion that the pistol went off by accident\u2014in the sense that it was not discharged by any act of the accused done with the intention of discharging it\u2014(or are not satisfied that it did not go off in that manner) they should find a verdict of manslaughter unless they are satisfied that the conduct of the accused was such that he knew or ought to have known it to be likely to induce such a struggle as occurred and that somebody\u2019s death was likely to be caused thereby and that such was the actual effect of his conduct and of the struggle.\nBy the 1947 amendment the following further alternative condition was added to section 260:\u2014\n(d) if he uses or has upon his person any weapon during or at the time of the commission or attempted commission by him of any of the offences in this section mentioned or the flight of the offender upon the commission or attempted commission thereof, and death ensues as a consequence of its use.\nI find myself in respectful agreement with the argument of Mr. Common that the amendment does make a change in the law as laid down in The King v. Hughes, with the result that now if an offender during or at the time of the commission of one of the offences mentioned or during or at the time of his flight upon the commission or attempted commission thereof is using a revolver and death ensues as a consequence of its use this will be murder even although the actual discharge of such revolver was accidental in the sense above mentioned. It remains to consider the meaning of the words \u201cflight upon the commission of the offence.\u201d Counsel were not able to refer us to any reported case dealing with the interpretation of these words.\nMr. Common, while submitting that in the case at bar he does not need to press his argument so far, contends that the flight of the offender, within the meaning of the section continues so long as he is apprehensive of and seeking to evade arrest. The difficulty in accepting this is that to do so would bring about the result that once a person had committeed one of the offences mentioned in section 260 he would, within the meaning of clause (d) of that section continue to be in flight until he was apprehended and would therefore be guilty of murder if anyone was killed by the accidental discharge of a pistol which he was using for any purpose. Mr. Poole contends that the word \u201cflight\u201d, as used in the section, pre-supposes the existence not only of a person who is fleeing but also of a pursuer and that a \u201cflight upon the commission of an offence\u201d cannot still be in progress hours after such commission when there has been no pursuit at all.\nThe effect of the amendment is, in circumstances to which it is applicable, to render a person guilty of murder who would not otherwise have been guilty of that crime and any doubt as to its meaning which remains after the application of the rules of construction must be resolved in favorem vitae.\nIn construing the section, I think it should be borne in mind that a person who has committed a crime is usually apprehended, if apprehended at all, in one of two ways; either (a) at or near the scene of the crime or as the result of a pursuit, long or short, commencing as he leaves the scene of the crime or (b) having escaped from the scene of the crime, being neither interrupted during its commission nor freshly pursued after its commission, he is later apprehended as the result of police investigation and detective work. It seems to me that the words \u201cthe flight of the offender upon the commission\u201d as used in clause (d) are apt to describe the situation suggested in (a) above, to the exclusion of that suggested in (b). I can find no logical stopping place between so holding and accepting the argument of counsel for the Crown which is put in the following way in his factum:\u2014\nIt is further submitted that in the circumstances of this case having regard to the nature of the armed robbery at Windsor that \u201cflight of the offender\u201d continued during the freedom of the offender while evading arrest and terminated upon his apprehension. The length of time between the crime and apprehension is immaterial if the offender is evading arrest thus escaping from lawful apprehension. To this extent evading arrest, and escaping lawful apprehension are synonymous.\nI do not think that the words\u2014\u201cduring or at the time of . . . the flight of the offender upon the commission of an offence\u201d\u2014are synonymous with the words\u2014\u201cso long as an offender is a fugitive from justice\u201d; nor do I think that flight within the meaning of the section continues so long as fear of apprehension lingers in the mind of the offender. I do not think it necessary to decide whether the existence of a pursuit is in all cases a necessary condition of the existence of a flight; but for an offender\u2019s conduct to fall within the meaning of that word as used in clause (d) after he has got well away from the scene of the crime I think it necessary that there be in progress a pursuit continuing from such scene. A flight from a pursuit commenced later as a result of the offender being traced or identified by detective work would not, in my opinion, be a flight upon the commission of the offence but rather a flight from such fresh pursuit or the danger thereof. Among the meanings given to the word \u201cupon\u201d in the Oxford Dictionary are \u201cfollowing upon\u201d, \u201cimmediately after.\u201d It is in this sense that I think the word is used in section 260(d).\nI have reached the conclusion that there was no evidence in the case at bar on which it could be held that at the time of the fatal discharge of the revolver the appellant was in flight upon the commission of the robbery in which he had taken part in Windsor. No pursuit of the appellant was in progress. None had commenced. He was separated by more than 100 miles in distance and by some hours in time from the scene and moment of the Windsor robbery. He and his accomplice had made good their escape from the vicinity of the scene of the crime. Thereafter they had spent a short time in Windsor endeavouring to dispose of the proceeds of the robbery and, failing in this, they had negotiated with the taxi driver, Jolly, to drive them as far as London where they hoped to dispose of such proceeds for enough money to enable them to pay the taxi fare and to continue their journey to Toronto where for varying reasons each of them wished to visit his wife. If my opinion as to the proper construction of the section, set out above, is correct, it is clear that under these circumstances the appellant in the service station at London was not in flight upon the commission of the robbery at Windsor. Indeed if I understand the theory of the Crown, in so far as it relates to flight from Windsor rather than to attempted robbery at London, it is that the appelant drew his revolver in the London service station not because he had any thought that a pursuit from Windsor was in progress but rather because he feared that if the police came in answer to Jolly\u2019s summons they would find him in possession of stolen goods. Had the appellant turned to flee at the moment of Jolly\u2019s call to the police he could not in my opinion be said to be fleeing upon the commission of the robbery in Windsor but only from the London police because he feared that they would find evidence which would ultimately lead to his apprehension for that crime.\nIf it is suggested that the construction, which I have indicated above to be, in my opinion, the correct one, brings about too lenient a result, it must be remembered that we are concerned with arriving at the intention of Parliament in a case where ex hypothesi the appellant not only had no intention of harming anyone but had no intention of discharging the revolver at all and that the question is not whether he ought on such hypothesis to be acquitted but whether he must as a matter of law be convicted of murder to the exclusion of manslaughter.\nFor the above reasons it is my respectful opinion that the learned trial judge erred in law in directing the jury that there was evidence on which they could find that the revolver was discharged during the appellant\u2019s flight upon the commission of the robbery in Windsor, within the meaning of section 260(d) of the Criminal Code and that if they so found they must convict him of murder. I think it impossible to say that but for this direction the jury must necessarily have found the same verdict.\nI would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a new trial.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wright and Poole.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.G. for Ontario.\n[1] [1942] S.C.R. 517.\n[2] (1839) 10 Ad. & E. 335.\n[3] [1942] S.C.R. 517.\n"

Barlow J. having found that personal service would be harmful to the appellant, dispensed with service upon him, declared him mentally incompetent, and referred the matter to the Master to appoint a committee, and to propound a scheme for the care and maintenance of the appellant and the management of his person and estate. The Master made a report whereby the respondent wife was appointed committee of the person, and the respondent trust company and herself committee of the estate and whereby he directed payment out of the estate of annual payments of $10,000 and $4,500 for the support and maintenance of the respondent wife and her invalid mother respectively. This report was confirmed by Barlow J.\nAppeals taken from each of the Orders of Barlow J. were dismissed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: (Cartwright J. dissenting), that there was jurisdiction in Barlow J. to dispense with service upon the appellant of the Notice of Motion and supporting affidavits and, sufficient evidence to warrant the finding of mental incompetency.\nRe Brathwaite 47 E.R. 1104; Re Newman 2 Ch. Ch. 390; Re Webb 12 O.L.R. 194.\nHeld: (Kerwin J. dissenting), that on the basis of the only evidence which the Master had before him the allowances granted to the appellant\u2019s wife and mother-in-law were excessive and the matter should be remitted to him for reconsideration.\nPer: Cartwright J., dissenting,\u2014Since the enactment of The Lunacy Act, 9 Ed. VII c. 37, power to dispense with service, if it exists, must be found in The Mental Incompetency Act, The Judicature Act, or in the rules made under one of such Acts, and since no express provision can be found in either Act, nor in any of the rules to which reference was made by \u2018counsel, it must be concluded that service of notice in such a case is imperatively required. If the Court had jurisdiction to dispense with service, the matter before it was insufficient to warrant the making of either an Order dispensing therewith or an Order of mental incompetency.\nAPPEAL by special leave from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing appeals from the orders of Barlow J. of December 8 and 22, 1950.\nLewis Duncan K.C. for the appellant.\nJ.L. McLennan K.C. and R.D. Poupore for Laura May Wright, respondent.\nT.M. Mungovan K.C. for Guaranty Trust Co. of Canada, respondent.\nKERWIN J. (dissenting in part):\u2014Leave was granted by this Court to Douglas G.H. Wright to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing his appeal from the orders of Barlow J. of December 8 and 22, 1950. The first order intituled \u201cIn the Matter of The Mental Incompetency Act, being Chapter 110 of The Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1937, and In The Matter of Douglas Guy Hobson Wright, a supposed mentally incompetent person\u201d, was made upon the application of his wife and was based upon an affidavit made by her, one by Dr. Spence, and another by Dr. Boyer. After reciting, \u201cit appearing that personal service of the notice of motion herein upon the said Douglas Guy Hobson Wright would be harmful to him\u201d, service upon him was dispensed with and it was declared that he, presently an inmate of Homewood Sanitarium, Guelph, Ontario, was a mentally incompetent person. It was referred to the Master to appoint a committee or committees of his person and estate, the Master was directed to propound and report a scheme for his maintenance and the management of his estate, and the order contained the other usual provisions. The order of December 22, 1950, confirmed the report of the Master dated December 14, by which Mrs. Wright had been appointed the committee of her husband\u2019s person, and Guaranty Trust Company of Canada and she had been appointed committee of the estate, the Trust Company being the accounting member of the committee and having the custody of the securities and cash. This order and report will be adverted to later.\nThe order of December 8 dispensing with service of the notice of motion and the accompanying affidavits and declaring the appellant a mentally incompetent person, is challenged on several grounds. We understand that substantially the same objections were raised in the Court of Appeal, although, since counsel for the appellant changed his position before us from time to time as to the meaning and effect of some of the rules of practice of the Supreme Court of Ontario under the Judicature Acts, it may be that the argument before the Court of Appeal did not take the same course as that followed here. There is nothing to prevent counsel changing his submissions on questions of law if no prejudice be caused, and the matter is mentioned merely in order to stress the fact that the appellant was unable to convince the Court of Appeal by anything that was there said. Laidlaw J.A., speaking for the Court, put it thus:\u2014\nCounsel for the appellant has failed to satisfy us in respect of any grounds upon which he brings these proceedings before the Court. There was ample evidence before the learned Judge to support the order in appeal. The proceedings before the learned Judge were regular, and he properly exercised the powers given to him by section 5 of The Mental Incompetency Act. We can find no error in the proceedings nor in the order. The appeal should be dismissed.\nReliance was placed upon that provision of Magna Carta appearing in section 2 of An Act respecting Certain Rights and Liberties of the People, R.S.O. 1897, chapter 322, and which Act is now inserted in Appendix A to R.S.O. 1950, at page 1 of Vol. 5, and specifically upon the words:\u2014\nNo man shall be taken or imprisoned nor prejudged of life or limb, nor be disseized or put out of his freehold, franchises, or liberties, or free customs, nor be outlawed, or exiled, or any otherwise destroyed, unless he be brought in to answer.\nThis must mean in accordance with the law as is indicated by the succeeding words:\u2014\u201cand prejudged of the same by due course of law\u201d. The position of lunatics was dealt with at common law in an entirely different manner from any other subject and since the former law and practice of inquest of office has been entirely superseded in Ontario, it is sufficient to refer to the history of the matter without detailing it.\nThe Legislature of Upper Canada in 1792 enacted that in all matters of controversy relating to property and civil rights, resort should be had to the laws of England. By section 5 of chapter 61 of the 1857 Statutes of Canada, it was provided that the Court might on sufficient evidence declare a person a lunatic without the delay or expense of issuing a commission, except in case of reasonable doubt. Chapter 65 of R.S.O. 1897, provided for an inquiry by commission, and an inquiry without commission, with, or without, the aid of a jury, and for the right of the alleged lunatic to demand that such latter inquiry be submitted to a jury. Rule 334 of the 1897 Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court of Ontario under The Judicature Act provided:\u2014\n334. Where it appears, upon the hearing of any matter, that by reason of absence, or for any other sufficient cause, the service of notice of the application, or of the appointment, cannot be made, or ought to be dispensed with, such service may be dispensed with, or any substituted service, or notice, by advertisement or otherwise may be ordered.\nDown to 1909, the practice in Upper Canada and Ontario was uniform to dispense with service of notice of motion for a commission or a declaration where such service would be dangerous or harmful to the alleged lunatic: In Re Patton[1]; In Re Newman[2]; In Re Mein[3]; In Re Webb[4]. The Lunacy Act, chapter 37 of the Statutes of 1909, repealed prior Acts dealing with the same subject, and subsection 1 of section 36 enacted:\u2014\n36(1) The Supreme Court may make rules for carrying this Act into effect and for regulating the costs in relation thereto and except where inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, or such rules, The Judicature Act and Rules made thereunder shall apply to proceedings under this Act.\nThe rules were next revised in 1913 and Rule 334 was omitted. In the same revision, Rule 213 provided:\u2014\n213. Any application in an action or proceeding shall be made by motion, and notice of the motion shall be given to all parties affected by the order sought. In the 1928 revision of the rules, No. 213 was amended so as to read as follows:\u2014\n213. Any application in an action or proceeding shall be made by motion, and unless the nature of the application or the circumstances of the case render it impracticable notice of the motion shall be given to all parties affected by the order sought.\nThe decision of Mr. Justice Britton in Re Morrison[5] while made after the Lunacy Act of 1909, was given before the new Consolidation of the Rules, 1928. Furthermore, the application there made was refused on several grounds and it is the only reported case where any intimation is given that even at that time there was no power to order that service upon the individual of the notice of motion to declare him incompetent should be dispensed with. Counsel for the appellant did not deny that such a power has been exercised for many years at Osgoode Hall.\nThe actual decision in In re McLaughlin[6], does not assist in the disposition of the present appeal but it is important to note what is said by Lord Davey, speaking for the Judicial Committe, at page 347:\u2014\nIt must be remembered that this particular jurisdiction is one of some peculiarity and difficulty. It exists for the benefit of the lunatic, and the guiding principle of the whole jurisdiction is what is most for the benefit of the unhappy subject of the application.\nThis shows that the question of lunacy or mental incompetency has always occupied a separate position and, viewing the present rules of practice in the light of that underlying proposition, Rule 213, as it now reads, is on its proper construction applicable to such an application as was made here and is not confined to applications in an action or a proceeding already commenced. In any event the notice of motion dated December 7, 1950, was filed in the Registrar\u2019s office the same date in accordance with Rule 234 so that the application for an order dispensing with service may be said to have been made in a pending proceeding.\nIn view of this special jurisdiction, section 35 of The Mental Incompetency Act, R.S.O. 1937, chapter 110, as amended by section 20 of chapter 55 of the 1941 statutes (replacing subsection 1 of section 36 of the Lunacy Act of 1909) and enacting:\u2014\n35. Subject to the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, the Rules Committee may make rules for carrying this Act into effect and for regulating the costs in relation thereto, and except where inconsistent with the provisions of this Act or such rules, The Judicature Act and rules made thereunder shall apply to proceedings under this Act.\ndoes not prohibit that part of the first order of Mr. Justice Barlow, which dispensed with service of the notice of motion upon the appellant. On the contrary, the rules made under The Judicature Act justify it. The rules as thus interpreted are not inconsistent with any of the other provisions of The Mental Incompetency Act. Particular stress was placed upon sections 5 and 6. Subsection 3 of the former gives the alleged mentally incompetent person the right to appeal from any order made by the Court declaring him such. Section 6 deals with the directing of an issue. Subsection 1 thereof provides:\u2014\n(1) Where in the opinion of the Court the evidence does not establish beyond reasonable doubt the alleged mental incompetency, or where for any other reason the Court deems it expedient so to do, instead of making an order under subsection 1 of section 5, the Court may direct an issue to try the alleged mental incompetency.\nOther subsections give directions as to the method and place of trial and give the alleged mentally incompetent person the like right to move against a verdict or to appeal from an order made upon or after the trial as may be exercised by a party to an action including the right of appeal. Section 7 gives the alleged incompetent the right to demand that any issue directed to determine the question of his mental incompetency be tried with a jury. The mere fact that provision is thus made for an appeal by the alleged incompetent and, if the trial of an issue is directed, for his right to demand a jury, indicates that there is no lack of jurisdiction in the Court hearing a notice of motion for a declaration of incapacity to direct that notice of motion shall not be given to the alleged incompetent, where the judge before whom the application comes is of opinion, as was the case here, that personal service would be harmful to the party involved. It was suggested that \u201cimpracticable\u201d was confined to something that could not be put to use or practically dealt with but one definition of \u201cpracticable\u201d in the Oxford English Dictionary and Funk and Wagnall\u2019s Standard Dictionary is \u201cfeasible\u201d. This means not only feasible in a physical sense since a thing or a proceeding may be said to be practicable from other points of view and, therefore, the opinions of the doctors as to the effect upon the appellant of the service upon him of the notice of motion and copies of the affidavits may be said to make such service impracticable.\nOn the second point raised by the appellant, without referring to any parts of the affidavits which under any argument presented by counsel for the appellant might be said to be hearsay, I find myself in agreement with Barlow J. and the members of the Court of Appeal, all of whom considered that the evidence submitted to the former was sufficient to \u201cestablish beyond reasonable doubt\u201d, as prescribed by section 6(1) of The Mental Incompetency Act, that the appellant was a mentally incompetent person. He was admitted to Homewood Sanitarium at Guelph on October 25, 1950; his wife\u2019s affidavit was sworn to December 1; that of Dr. Spence on December 2; and the affidavit of Dr. Boyer on December 6. Dr. Spence had seen the appellant on October 18 and he was one of the medical men upon whose certificate the appellant was admitted to the sanitarium. His opinion, based on the facts recited by him and his observations, was that on December 2 the appellant was unable to transact ordinary business matters or give proper consideration to the protection and conservation of his estate. Dr. Boyer examined the appellant on October 24. He pledged his oath that the appellant had at that time a manic reaction and in his opinion the appellant needed hospital and custodial care. He also gave his opinion from the facts set out by him and his observations that the appellant by reason of his mental condition was unable to transact ordinary business matters or to give proper consideration to the protection and conservation of his estate. In view of the opinions expressed by the doctors on December 2nd and 6th, respectively, and of the contents of Mrs. Wright\u2019s affidavit, sworn to December 1, the lapse of time between the last occasions upon which the doctors saw the appellant and the making of the order is not so great or so significant as to raise any doubt as to the soundness of the order. The third main submission on behalf of the appellant was that there was no evidence, or insufficient evidence, to justify paragraphs 5, 6(a), (b), (d), of the report of the Master of December 14, 1950. The Master found the value of the appellant\u2019s estate to be approximately $310,000 of which the annual income was about $10,000. According to an affidavit of Mrs. Wright, she owned the house and property in which she and the appellant had resided in Forest Hill Village, and personal estate to the value of about $160,000, which produced an annual income of $6,000. The cost of maintaining herself and the property was put by her at $9,600 per annum. While there is no record of any testimony having been given at the time, it is not disputed that Mrs. Wright and her solicitor and an officer of the Trust Company attended the Master who questioned Mrs. Wright in order to satisfy himself as to the nature of the scheme which he should propound.\nIn paragraph 5 of the report, which is the first to be objected to, the Master states:\u2014\n5. I further find that in addition to his wife, the said Laura May Wright, the said Douglas Guy Hobson Wright had dependent upon him Mrs. Mima Hughes, the mother of the said Laura May Wright now in her 84th year and a chronic invalid. I further find that the outlay by the said Douglas Guy Hobson Wright in respect of the maintenance of the said Mrs. Mima Hughes and for medical and nursing attendance during the past two years has been approximately $4,500 per year.\nWe were informed that Mrs. Mima Hughes died shortly after the making of the report and, while there is no evidence that she was dependent upon the appellant, there is no contradiction of the statement to the effect in the Master\u2019s report. I am not prepared to disagree with the Courts below and set aside paragraph 5 although under other circumstances a serious view should be taken of the fact that no sworn testimony was given relating to the matter.\nParagraph 8(a) directed that there be paid to the appellant\u2019s wife for her own support and maintenance the annual sum of $10,000. In the opinion of Barlow J. and of the Court of Appeal, this was justified by Mrs. Wright\u2019s affidavit. Paragraph 8(b) is the one providing for payment of the annual sum of $4,500 for the support, nursing and medical attendance of Mrs. Hughes. After reporting in paragraph (c) that the present arrangement for the appellant\u2019s care appeared to be satisfactory, the Master recommended that the committee of the estate be authorized to provide for the appellant\u2019s continued maintenance at the Homewood Sanitarium at the rate of $70 per week, together with any medical or nursing expenses that might be necessary, and to supply any clothes or comforts that the appellant might properly require. Provision was made that if the rate of maintenance be increased, the committee be authorized to pay the same with the approval of the Master. Then came paragraph 8(d) in which, after stating that the income from the estate would not be sufficient to cover the cost of the appellant\u2019s maintenance and the other allowances, it was recommended that the committee be authorized to encroach upon the corpus of the estate and for this purpose, with the Master\u2019s approval, to sell any of the assets.\nThe appellant and his wife have no children and the wife apparently considered it not improvident that part of the corpus should be used for the purposes mentioned. There is no rule that this may not be done and in fact in many cases it is impossible to provide for the proper maintenance of a mentally incompetent person without doing so. If it is found that that is not going to be satisfactory, the matter may always be brought before the Master again.\nThe appeal should be dismissed. No order should be made as to costs except that the costs of the wife and the Trust Company be paid by the committee forthwith after taxation thereof out of the assets of the appellant\u2019s estate which may be in the hands of the committee.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Kellock and Estey JJ. was delivered by:\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014This is an appeal by special leave of this court from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing an appeal from an order of Barlow J. of December 8, 1950, declaring the appellant a mentally incompetent person and directing a reference to the Master to appoint a committee of his person and estate, and propound a scheme for his maintenance and the management of his estate. The appeal is also from the subsequent order of Barlow J. of December 22, 1950, which affirmed the Master\u2019s report.\nIn his original order, the learned judge had directed that service upon the appellant of the notice of the motion should be dispensed with. This order was made upon the basis of affidavits of two medical witnesses to the effect that personal service upon the appellant would be harmful to him in view of his condition of health. With respect to the order of December 8, the appeal is based upon the contention that the learned judge had no jurisdiction to dispense with service, and in any event, that the evidence did not justify any declaration of mental incompetency.\nWith respect to the first ground, it is contended that whatever may have been the situation prior to 1909, when the statute 9 Ed. VII c. 37 was passed, that statute, in providing by s. 36(1) that The Judicature Act and rules made thereunder should apply to proceedings under the Act except where inconsistent with the statute itself, had the effect thereafter of requiring either personal or substituted service of such notices of motion. In my opinion, this contention is not well founded.\nJurisdiction with respect to declarations of lunacy was, in England, until a comparatively late date, exercised by the Lord Chancellor as delegate of the Sovereign, and not by the Court of Chancery. When, however, the Court of Chancery was set up in Upper Canada in 1837 by 7 Wm. IV c. 2, the court was given \u201clike power and authority as by the laws of England are possessed by the Court of Chancery in England\u201d in all matters relating to idiots and lunatics and their estates, except where special provision had been or might be made with respect thereto by any law of the province.\nDoubts subsequently arose as to the jurisdiction thus conferred, and in 1846 the statute, 9 Vict. c. 10, was enacted to remove these doubts and to extend the law. The statute recites that \u201cby the laws of England, the custody, care and management of lunatics, idiots and persons of unsound mind and their property and estates does not of right belong to or form part of the jurisdiction of Chancery, but the same is conferred upon the Lord Chancellor or some other person or persons under and by the commission of the Crown, under the sign manual.\u201d It is therefore enacted\nthat it was intended that the said Court of Chancery should have the like jurisdiction as given to the Lord Chancellor in England.\nand that from and after the passing of the Act, the said court shall\nwith a like power and authority as exercised by the Lord Chancellor in England, or such other person or persons which may be entrusted as aforesaid, have the care and custody of all lunatics, idiots and persons of unsound mind in that part of the province, formerly Upper Canada, and of their real and personal estates so that the same shall not be wasted or destroyed; and shall provide for their safe keeping and maintenance and for the maintenance of their families and education of their children out of their personal estates and real estates respectively.\nThis jurisdiction of the Lord Chancellor thus bestowed upon the court was \u201cin its nature\u201d an ex parte jurisdiction; Re Braithwaite[7], and was exercised under a commission granted by the Lord Chancellor and directed to certain persons to inquire, with the aid of a jury, into the alleged unsoundness of mind, the inquisition thereupon being returned into the Court of Chancery with the appropriate finding. Notice of the execution of the commission was not given to the alleged lunatic unless a caveat had been entered by him or unless an order were obtained on application to the court directing that reasonable notice be given to the alleged lunatic; Shelford p. 101; K. v. Daly[8]. If lunacy were found, the person so declared had the right by petition to traverse the inquisition, and thereupon the court might direct a new trial which, in Upper Canada, took place before a judge of the Court of Chancery with the aid of a jury \u201caccording to the circumstances of the case and the situation of the parties.\u201d\nIn 1857 and again in 1865, alternative modes of proceeding to that by way of inquisition under a commission, were provided. In 1857, by 20 Vict. c. 56, it was provided by s. 5 that the court might, on sufficient evidence, declare a person lunatic without the delay or expense of issuing a commission, \u201cexcept in cases of reasonable doubt,\u201d and any person who, before the Act, had the right to traverse an inquisition might move against such order or appeal therefrom, as the case might require, subject to the same rules as to time to which the right to traverse was subject. The statute of 1865, 28 Vict. c. 17, provided that where a commission of lunacy would have theretofore been necessary or proper, the court in lieu thereof, with or without a jury, might hear evidence and inquire into and determine the alleged lunacy. In such case the alleged lunatic had the right to demand that the inquiry be submitted to a jury, or the court might order that the inquiry be had before any court of record. Section 6 provided that in any such case, no traverse should be allowed, but the court, if dissatisfied with the finding of a jury, might, at the instance of any party who would be entitled to traverse an inquisition under a commission, direct a new trial upon application therefor made to the court within three months of the verdict. These alternative proceedings were continued side by side down to the passing of the statute of 1909 when the procedure by inquisition under a commission was dropped.\nWhile this was the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery and its successor, the Supreme Court of Ontario, nevertheless, at a comparatively early date, the court in ordinary cases would direct notice of the application to be given to the alleged lunatic, but the jurisdiction to dispense with notice in appropriate cases remained and was, from time to time, exercised as occasion required.\nIn Re Patton[9], Spragge V.C., in giving directions on an application pending before him, said that\nI should incline also to require that the alleged lunatic be notified.\nWhen it subsequently appeared that the officials at the asylum where the alleged lunatic was confined would not allow him to be served with the petition, as he was suicidal and to permit it might prove dangerous to him, Vankoughnet C. made the declaration without service. An example of the normal practice of requiring notice to be given to the alleged lunatic is to be found in the decision of Spragge V.C. in In Re Miller[10]. Britton J. in Re Morrison[11], was not laying down any new practice in what he there said. Illustrations also of the exercise of the jurisdiction to dispense with service are to be found in In Re Main[12]; In Re Newman[13], and Re Webb[14], the last mentioned case being a decision of Mabee J. in 1906.\nThe jurisdiction conferred by 9 Vict. c. 10 was continued down through the various revisions of the statutes and no change in this jurisdiction was made or intended by the statute of 1909, which in s. 3 reads as follows:\nSubject to the provisions of The Act respecting Lunatic Asylums and the custody of Insane Persons, the Court shall have all the powers, jurisdiction and authority of His Majesty over and in relation to the persons and estates of lunatics, including the care and the commitment of the custody of lunatics and of their persons and estate.\nWhile by s. 36, the rules under The Judicature Act are to apply in lunacy proceedings, they are to apply \u201cexcept where inconsistent with the provisions of this Act.\u201d The jurisdiction conferred upon the Court by s. 3 to make ex parte orders, renders application of the ordinary rules requiring service quite inconsistent therewith.\nIn my opinion, the provision made by s. 36 with respect to the rules did not change the situation previously existing, as the Consolidated Rules of 1897 were already applicable to all proceedings in the Court by reason of s. 122 of The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1897 c. 51. The same had also been true of the earlier rules. It is the fact that Rule 334 of the 1897 rules contained a provision enabling service to be dispensed with in cases to which it applied, and this rule goes back to Order 34, s. 5, of the Chancery Orders of 1853. However, both In Re Patton and Re Newman appear to have been proceedings under the amendment of 1857 Re Newman is expressly so) and not proceedings by way of inquisition upon commission, and in neither does it appear that the jurisdiction to dispense with service was based upon the rule. On the contrary, the order in Newman\u2019s case was expressly placed upon the basis of the jurisdiction of the Lord Chancellor as set forth in Shelford on Lunacy.\nRule 334 was not continued in the revision of the rules in 1913, and until 1921 the rules did not contain any provision authorizing service of any notice of motion to be dispensed with. In Re McNab[15], a decision of Masten J., as he then was, there were affidavits of two medical men to the effect that it would be dangerous to serve notice of the application upon the alleged incompetent, one of the affidavits stating that service upon a Mrs. Austin, who was in charge of the private sanatarium where the alleged incompetent was being cared for, would accomplish more than could be effected by personal service. Examination of the file does not disclose any evidence of service, and there appears to have been no order for substituted service. The formal order recites only the affidavits already referred to and the affidavit of the medical superintendent of the sanitarium, which the report shows the learned judge required before his order was to go, and while it contains no express provision dispensing with service, it appears to have been made without notice to the incompetent, in the same way as that made in Patton\u2019s case. The declaration made by the order was under s. 36 of the Act of 1914, and was not a declaration of lunacy. An order in such a case without notice could only have been properly made by analogy to the jurisdiction with respect to the making of a declaration of lunacy. Masten J. was a very eminent and a very careful judge, and in my opinion, would not have made such an order except on the basis of the jurisdiction which I have discussed.\nWhen the statute of 1909 was passed, a number of the provisions of the British Lunacy Act of 1890, 53 Vict. c. 5, were incorporated into the Ontario statute. The significant thing, however, is that while the English statute, by sub-s. 2 of s. 90, requires notice of the application to be given to the alleged lunatic if within the jurisdiction, this provision was not incorporated in the Ontario statute, although s. 3 sub-s. 2 of the latter, which authorizes the making of declarations, is taken from s. 108 sub-s. 2 of the English Act. At the same time, sub-s. 1 of s. 3 of the Ontario statute continues the former jurisdiction. In my opinion, had it been the intention of the provincial legislature in 1909, with the English statute before it, to affect the existing jurisdiction to make declarations of lunacy without notice, such an important change would have been effected by some express provision, such as had been enacted in Eng- land, rather than by leaving the matter to implication, if such an inference could be found in the general frame of the statute as, in my respectful opinion, it cannot be.\nThere is a further consideration. The Judicial Committee in Re McLaughlin[16], per Lord Davey, said:\n\u201cIt\u201d (i.e. the jurisdiction in lunacy) \u201cexists for the benefit of the lunatic, and the guiding principle of the whole jurisdiction is what is most for the benefit of the unhappy subject of the application.\u201d\nAlthough the legislation in question in that case was not the same as in the case at bar, the above was said in connection with the very subject matter here under discussion, namely, the question as to service of notice upon the alleged lunatic of an application for a declaration of lunacy.\nThe guiding principle being as stated, it would surely require very clear statutory direction to take from the court the discretion conferred upon it in 1846 and to render obligatory in every case that notice be served upon an allegedly mentally incompetent person, notwithstanding that in the opinion of professional witnesses, to do so would be inimical to the interests of \u201cthe unhappy subject of the application.\u201d Yet this is the substance of the argument put forward on behalf of the appellant.\nIt is argued for the appellant that, in any event, the evidence upon which Barlow J. proceeded in dispensing with service was insufficient. It is, of course, beyond question that in making orders of this kind, the court ought to require very clear evidence that the normal course should not be followed. In the case at bar, however, the evidence was sufficient, both in the view of the learned judge of first instance and the Court of Appeal, and in these circumstances I do not think a case has been made out for interfering with the order on that ground.\nIt is next contended on behalf of the appellant that the evidence was not sufficient to establish the mental incompetency of the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt at the date of the order in question, or at any date subsequent to the month of October 1950. It is clear, however, upon the material, that the appellant was suffering from a mania of a nature which had not developed over-night nor would pass over-night. His condition toward the end of October had become such that he required custodial care for himself, and he was confined in a private sanitarium upon the certificates of two medical men pursuant to the Private Sanitaria Act, R.S.O. 1950 c. 290. He was also quite incapable of caring for his property, having in fact physically destroyed part of it in quite a violent way. Such a condition is not one of a mere passing nature. There can, I think, be taken from the affidavit of the wife, the fact, at least, that the condition had been of some standing or had been developing for some time. In fact, the appellant remained in the institution until March 10, 1951, when we were advised by his counsel he was then released, which release, as appears from the order of the Master of the 13th of March, 1951, was made pursuant to the provisions of s. 54 of the Private Sanitaria Act, which provides that if the superintendent of the sanitarium considers it conducive to the recovery of a patient that he should be entrusted for a time to the care of friends, that official may allow such patient to return on trial to his friends upon receiving an undertaking in writing by one or more of them that an oversight will be kept over him. The appellant was in this instance released into the care of a brother. Counsel for the committee applied, under the provisions of the second paragraph of s. 68 of the Supreme Court Act, to place the order of the Master in evidence, and in my opinion, it should be admitted. In the circumstances thus disclosed, in view of the concurrent findings below, I think that any lacuna, if there be one, in the material is sufficiently filled in. In my opinion, therefore, the appeal fails with respect to the order of December 8, 1950.\nIt is further contended on behalf of the appellant that there was no evidence, or, in any event, insufficient evidence to justify the findings of the Master that the mother-in-law of the appellant, since deceased, was a dependent of his, or to justify the annual payments for her maintenance and for that of the wife of the appellant of $4,500 and $10,000 respectively, in addition to the outlay for the care and maintenance of the appellant himself, resulting in substantial encroachment upon the corpus of the estate. The only evidence before the Master upon which these directions were based showed that the appellant\u2019s estate was worth some $310,000 producing an annual income of approximately $10,000, while the wife herself has a personal estate of some $160,000 from which she derives an annual income of $6,000. The latter\u2019s affidavit states that the annual cost of maintaining herself and the city residence of the appellant and herself will be approximately $9,600. We were told that additional oral statements of fact were made to the Master in connection with the matters before him, but that the witnesses were unsworn. These statements were not in a form to which the Master was entitled to have regard, and on the basis of the only evidence which the Master had before him, I think that these allowances were excessive, and that the matter should be remitted to him for reconsideration.\nI would therefore allow the appeal with respect to paragraphs 5 and 8 (a), (b) and (d) of the order of the Master of the 14th of December, 1950, and so much of the order of Barlow J. of the 22nd of December 1950 and the order of the Court of Appeal as relates to the said paragraphs, and direct that the matters covered by the said paragraphs be remitted to the Master for further consideration. The costs of all parties here and below should be taxed and be paid out of the estate in the hands of the committee.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting in part):\u2014This is an appeal, pursuant to leave granted by this court on the 10th of May, 1951, from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on the 6th of April, 1951, dismissing the appeal of Douglas Guy Hobson Wright from two orders of Barlow J. made on the 8th and 22nd days of December, 1950, respectively, the first declaring the appellant a mentally incompetent person and directing the usual reference to the Master and the second confirming the Master\u2019s report.\nBoth orders are attacked on several grounds. In the view which I take of the matter it is necessary to consider only the first order as I have reached the conclusion that it cannot stand and the second order falls with it.\nThe first objection advanced against this order is that it was made without service upon the appellant of notice of the application, and that consequently the proceedings were coram non judice and void. We were assisted by counsel by a full and able argument in which the history of proceedings in lunacy in England and in this country was explored but I do not find it necessary to go at length into the historical aspect of the matter. The reasons of my brother Kellock, which I have had the advantage of reading, satisfy me that following the enactment of Chapter 10 of the Statutes of Canada, 1846, 9 Victoria, the Court of Chancery exercised the like jurisdiction in regard to persons of unsound mind as was conferred upon the Lord Chancellor in England by a Commission from the Crown under the Sign Manual which at that time included a jurisdiction to proceed ex parte.\nThat such jurisdiction was exercised with great caution appears from many reported cases. In Shelford on Lunacy (1833) the matter is dealt with as follows at page 60:\u2014\nThe English constitution has with much care provided protection for persons who are represented to be of unsound mind; and has been extremely cautious to prevent the power of the Crown, or of individuals, to interfere with such persons, from being assumed in any case where it is not required for the safety of the public and of individuals; because it is difficult to exert such power without depriving the subject of that liberty, and power of dealing with his property, which ought to be unrestricted, unless the necessity for restraint be clearly proved.\nIt has, in the first place, made it necessary, before a commission of lunacy is issued, that a petition should be presented to the person who is delegated to exercise this authority of the Crown, and imposed on such person the duty of considering whether there is ground for an inquiry or not. It does not allow that individual to declare, that the person is of unsound mind; it calls on him to look through the case which is brought before him, to decide whether or not there is ground for further inquiry; if he finds that there is, the matter then goes to a jury of the country. Lord Chancellor Eldon laid it down as unquestionable, that the Crown has not, in England, the power of taking upon itself the care of any individuals, either as to their persons or their property, on the ground that they are of unsound mind, without the verdict of a jury.\nIt appears that the supposed lunatic had a right to be present at the execution of the commission. The law is so stated in Shelford at page 100 and, in ex parte Cranmer[17], The Lord Chancellor, Lord Erskine, in directing the issue of a commission said:\u2014\nThe party certainly must be present at the execution of the Commission. It is his privilege. Notwithstanding the existence of the safeguards mentioned above and of the right of traverse, Shelford, in a foot note at page 101, expressed himself as follows:\u2014\nIt is a subject of surprise, that such a rule as this should still prevail in matters of lunacy, and that a commission should be granted without requiring any notice to be given either to the party to be affected by it, or to some of his relations which are not concerned in the application; and that it is practicable for a comparatively secret tribunal to sit in judgment upon the actions and state of mind of a party, without his having an opportunity of preparing for his own vindication, and defending himself against the imputation of insanity. Notwithstanding the right to traverse, it is submitted, with great deference, that it would be proper to make a general order of Court, requiring reasonable notice in all cases to be given to the party, or to some of his relations or friends who are not concerned in the application, of the intention to apply for a commission of lunacy against him. Such notice, if the party possessed any reason, would enable him to oppose the application in the first instance, and would be no obstacle against the issuing of a commission in cases of absolute necessity.\nIn 1853 by Chapter 70 of the Statutes of the United Kingdom, 16 and 17 Victoria, section 40, it was provided, in part:\u2014\u201cWhere the alleged lunatic is within the jurisdiction he shall have notice of the presentation of the petition for Inquiry.\u201d In such case the alleged lunatic had the right to demand an inquiry before a jury. Section 45 of the same Act provided:\u2014\nWhere the alleged Lunatic is not within the Jurisdiction the Inquiry shall be before a Jury, and no further or other Notice shall be necessary to be given to him than he would have been entitled to receive if this Act had not been passed.\nIt was conceded by counsel that in England since 1853 the alleged lunatic has been entitled to notice if within the jurisdiction.\nThere appear to be comparatively few reported cases in Ontario in which the power of the court to dispense with service on the alleged lunatic and the circumstances under which such power should be exercised are discussed. Counsel referred us to the following:\u2014Re Miller[18], Re Patton[19], Re Newman[20], Re Mein[21], Re Webb[22], Re Morrison[23]. Re Miller was a decision of Spragge V.C. on an application to declare a person a lunatic. The judgment reads as follows:\u2014\nThe affidavits are very strong, and leave no reasonable doubt as to the alleged lunatic being of unsound mind; but he ought to have notice, and any persons, counsel or others, whom he may desire to see in reference to this application must have free access to him.\nRe Patton was a motion to declare a person a lunatic made before Spragge V.C. who declined to make an order without personal service and adjourned the application taking the view that the material before him was insufficient. The application was renewed before Vankoughnet C. supported by an additional affidavit of another medical man and by evidence that the officers at the asylum would not allow service as the lunatic was suicidal and it might be dangerous to serve him. The Chancellor made the order without service on the alleged lunatic.\nRe Newman and Re Mein were decisions of the Secretary following Re Patton. The respective headnotes accurately summarize the decisions and are as follows:\u2014\nRe Newman\u2014On an application to declare a person a lunatic without commission, an affidavit by an officer of a lunatic asylum that the alleged lunatic is in such a state of mind as that service on him would be dangerous and prejudicial to him, will not be held sufficient to dispense with personal service on him.\nWhere, however, such affidavit was corroborated by others, and it was evident the party was a dangerous lunatic, personal service on him was dispensed with.\nIn re Mein\u2014Notice of a motion to declare a person a lunatic and to apply the estate of an alleged lunatic to his maintenance, &c., in a lunatic asylum, should be served on the lunatic personally, if it is practicable to do so, without danger to his health or state of mind. Where, therefore, a notice of such a motion had not been served on the ground that doing so would be useless in consequence of the state of the alleged lunatic; the Secretary directed that some medical man, other than the physician of the asylum, should visit the asylum and give evidence as to the state of the lunatic, and whether service could be effected on him.\nIn Re Webb, Mabee J. followed Re Newman and Re Mein and made an order dispensing with personal service on the alleged lunatic, but confirming an order for service on the Superintendent of the Asylum, on evidence that service \u201cmight dangerously excite the patient.\u201d It will be observed that all these cases were decided prior to 1909. Counsel for the appellant argues that since the enactment, in that year, of Chapter 37 of the Statutes of Ontario, 9 Edward VII, the power to dispense with service, if it existed theretofore, has ceased to exist. It is pointed out that with the passing of this Act the practice of Inquisition by Commission (which had continued up to that time, appearing last in R.S.O. 1897, Cap. 65) disappeared and that thereafter with immaterial verbal changes the practice by which a person may be declared a lunatic has been that now prescribed in The Mental Incompetency Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 230 and particularly sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 35 thereof.\nSection 5 is as follows:\u2014\n5(1) The court upon application supported by evidence may by order declare a person a mentally incompetent person if the court is satisfied that the evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt that he is a mentally incompetent person.\n(2) The application may be made by the Attorney-General, by any one or more of the next of kin of the alleged mentally incompetent person, by his or her wife or husband, by a creditor, or by any other person.\n(3) The alleged mentally incompetent person and any person aggrieved or affected by the order shall have the right to appeal therefrom.\n(4) The practices and procedure on the appeal shall be the same as on an appeal from an order made by a judge of the court.\nSection 6 provides that \u201cwhere in the opinion of the Court the evidence does not establish beyond reasonable doubt the alleged mental incompetency\u201d the Court may direct an issue and deals with the method of trial.\nSection 7 reads as follows:\u2014\n7. An alleged mentally incompetent person shall be entitled to demand, by notice in writing to be given to the person applying for the declaration of his mental incompetency and also to be filed in the office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court, Toronto, at least ten days before the first day of the sittings at which the issue is directed to be tried, that any issue directed to determine the question of his mental incompetency shall be tried with a jury, and, unless he withdraws the demand before the trial, or the court is satisfied by personal examination of the mentally incompetent person that he is not mentally competent to form and express a wish for a trial by jury and so declares by order, the issue shall be tried by a jury. Section 35 reads as follows:\u2014\n35. Subject to the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, the Rules Committee may make rules for carrying this Act into effect and for regulating the costs in relation thereto, and except where inconsistent with this Act or such rules, The Judicature Act and rules made thereunder shall apply to proceedings under this Act.\nIn my view, since the enactment of 9 Edward VII, c. 37, power to dispense with service, if it exists, must be found in The Mental Incompetency Act, in The Judicature Act, or in the rules made under one of such Acts. I can find no express provision in either Act which, in my opinion, permits an order of mental incompetency to be made without service of notice on the person whose status and property are to be affected. An examination of all the rules to which reference was made by counsel brings me to the conclusion that service of notice in such a case is imperatively required.\nReference may first be made to Rule 2(m) and Rule 11(1):\u2014\n2(m) In Rules 12 to 31 the words \u201cWrit of Summons\u201d and \u201cWrit\u201d shall include any document by which proceedings are commenced, and shall also include all proceedings by which a person not a party is added as a party either before or after judgment, e.g., proceedings in the Master\u2019s office and garnishee and third party proceedings.\n11(1) When by any statute a summary application without the institution of any action may be made to the Court or a Judge in a manner therein provided, such application may also be made by originating notice but any security required by such statute shall be given.\nThere can be no doubt that the notice of motion to declare a person mentally incompetent is \u201ca document by which proceedings are commenced\u201d and, therefore, is included in the words \u201cWrit of Summons\u201d or \u201cWrit\u201d where ever such words appear in Rules 12 to 31.\nRule 16 is imperative in its terms. It requires the notice to be served personally in the absence of an acceptance of service by a solicitor who undertakes to appear. It permits substituted service in a proper case, but in the case at bar no order for substituted service was asked for or made, and I do not pursue the question whether such an order could properly have been made. It is necessary to consider the effect of the opening words of Rule 16 \u201cSave as hereinafter provided.\u201d I can find no provision in any following rule which is apt to authorize the court to dispense with service on a person whom it is sought to have declared mentally incompetent, although a number of rules in certain circumstances vary the provisions of Rule 16. Examples are Rules 18, 21, 23, 24 and 101.\nRules 21 and 22 require consideration. They read as follows:\u2014\n21. Where a mentally incompetent person or person of unsound mind not so found by inquisition or judicial declaration, is a defendant, service on the committee of the mentally incompetent person or on the person with whom the defendant of unsound mind resides, or under whose care he is, shall, unless otherwise ordered, be deemed good service.\n22. After service of the writ no further proceedings shall be taken against a defendant who is a mentally incompetent person and has no committee, or no committee except the Public Trustee, or against a defendant of unsound mind not so found, until a guardian ad litem is appointed.\nIt is argued for the appellant that the definition section of The Judicature Act should be resorted to in interpreting the word \u201cdefendant\u201d in these rules. \u201cDefendant\u201d is defined by section 1(g) of The Judicature Act as follows\u2014\n1. In this Act * * *\n(g) \u201cdefendant\u201d includes a person served with a writ of summons or process, or served with notice of, or entitled to attend a proceeding;\nThe Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 185, provides by section 32 that \u201cthe interpretation section of the Judicature Act shall extend to all acts relating to legal matters,\u201d and by section 31(a) provides that \u201cAct\u201d shall include enactment. It may be suggested that a rule duly passed is an enactment but I am not prepared to differ from the view expressed by Orde J.A. in Bendjy v. Munton[24], at 137 that the interpretation section of The Judicature Act is not by implication to be extended to the Rules of Practice. But even if it be held that Rules 21 and 22 are applicable only to actions brought against a person mentally incompetent whether so found or not, I think that by virtue of the concluding words of Rule 1:\u2014\u201cAs to all matters not provided for in these Rules, the practice shall be regulated by analogy thereto\u201d they furnish a strong indication that the rules do not contemplate that a person alleged to be of unsound mind shall be judicially so found, without notice to anyone on his behalf and without the Court having the assistance of someone in a position to oppose the application.\nIt was urged on behalf of the respondent that Rule 213 gives the court jurisdiction to dispense with notice in such a case as the one at bar. This rule reads as follows:\u2014\n213. Any application in an action or proceeding shall be made by motion, and unless the nature of the application or the circumstances of the case render it impracticable notice of the motion shall be given to all parties affected by the order sought.\nIn my view the words \u201capplication in an action or proceeding\u201d are more apt to describe interlocutory proceedings than the commencement of a proceeding. The service of originating notices is specially dealt with in Rules 16, 215 (2), 601 and 602. The history of the precursors of Rule 213 does not, in my opinion, support the view that such rule was intended to permit the Court to deal, on originating notice, with matters affecting the rights of a party in a position analogous to that of a defendant in a manner as sweeping as would be possible in any action, without any notice to such party. I have particularly in mind the fact that from 1913 to 1928 the words \u201cunless the nature of the application or the circumstances of the case render it impracticable\u201d did not appear in Rule 213 and that from 1897 to 1913 the provision corresponding to such words was Rule 357, reading as follows:\u2014\n357. If satisfied that the delay caused by proceeding by notice of motion might entail serious mischief, the Court or a Judge may make any order ex parte, upon such terms as may seem just.\nThis rule replaced Rule 527 of the Consolidated Rules of 1888 which was substantially the same.\nIf it can be said that the words of Rule 213 are sufficiently general to appear to include all motions, the fact remains that the service of originating notices is specifically dealt with by Rule 16, which, as I have indicated, imperatively requires service thereof, either personal or substituted, and the general words of Rule 213 would yield to this special provision. Generalia specialibus non derogant.\nIt remains to be considered whether there is anything in the Mental Incompetency Act which by necessary implication shews that it was contemplated that proceedings to declare a person mentally incompetent could be taken ex parte. The scheme of all the relevant sections of the Mental Incompetency Act seems to me to contemplate that the alleged mentally incompetent person shall have the right to resist the application brought to so declare him. Such a right is implicit in the express statutory right given to such person to demand trial by jury (section 7) and to appeal (section 5(3)). It appears to me to be unthinkable that the legislature would expressly give the alleged mentally incompetent such rights unless it contemplated that he, or some one on his behalf, should have notice of the proceedings. These rights are not given conditionally upon his hearing by chance that the proceedings are afoot. They would be illusory indeed if the whole proceedings could be carried on in secret so far as the alleged mentally incompetent was concerned. If the matter appeared to me to be doubtful I would resolve the doubt in favour of requiring that notice be given to a person of proceedings the result of which may be to alter his status, to deprive him of liberty of action and to remove all his property from his control. To establish an exception to the elementary rule \u201caudi alteram partem\u201d, clear and unambiguous authority is required and I can find none. As is said in Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 10th Edition, at page 67:\u2014\n\u201cThe laws of God and man,\u201d said Fortescue J., in Dr. Bentley\u2019s Case, \u201cboth gave the party an opportunity to make his defence, if he has any.\u201d And immemorial custom cannot avail in contravention of this principle.\nIn the only reported case since 1909 to which we were referred by counsel; Re Morrison[25], the note reads, in part, as follows:\u2014\nBritton J. in a written judgment, said that an application to have a man declared a lunatic or incompetent to manage his business should at least be upon notice to the supposed incompetent of intention to make the application. Service of this notice should be proved.\nTo permit a person\u2019s rights to be dealt with in a judicial proceeding unless he has had an opportunity of being heard is contrary to the fundamental principles of the law, and appears to me particularly undesirable in a case such as this in which, if the order in appeal is upheld, the appellant who has been deprived, unheard, of his status and property is left without remedy except such as is afforded by section 9 of The Mental Incompetency Act. Except by leave of the Court he can not even be heard until a year has expired from the date of the order declaring him incompetent and, when he does obtain a hearing, instead of it lying upon those who question his competency to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt he must assume the burden of satisfying the court that he has become mentally competent and capable of managing his own affairs. I find this prospect particularly disquieting in the case at bar where the appellant has no control over any of his own property and, for reasons which do not appear in its oral judgment, the Court of Appeal has not permitted recourse to be had to such property for the purpose of paying the appellant\u2019s costs of taking the appeal which the Statute expressly authorized. The way of a suitor is not easy when all his assets are in the hands of those who oppose his suit.\nI have reached the conclusion that Barlow J. had no jurisdiction to entertain the motion without service of notice upon the appellant or properly authorized substituted service and that the order of December 8, 1950, must be set aside.\nIf I had found that the court had jurisdiction to dispense with service of notice of the proceedings I would, with the greatest respect, have been of opinion that the material before Barlow J. was insufficient to warrant the making of either an order dispensing with service or an order of mental incompetency. The learned Judge had before him three affidavits. The affidavit of the applicant was sworn on December 1, 1950. It does not deal with the question of service nor does it indicate that she had seen the appellant since the month of October when she describes the conduct on his part which is described in the affidavit of Dr. Spence. In considering the affidavits of Dr. Spence and Dr. Boyer it is necessary to bear in mind the provisions of Rule 293:\u2014\n293. Affidavits shall be confined to the statement of facts within the knowledge of the deponent, but on interlocutory motions statements as to his belief, with the grounds therefor, may be admitted.\nThe affidavit of Dr. Spence offends against this rule. In paragraph 2 he speaks of the appellant having \u201ca history of having had one depression during my absence with the Canadian forces overseas.\u201d Even on an interlocutory application such a statement would be inadmissable unless the source of the deponent\u2019s information was given. Paragraph 4 of the affidavit is hearsay. In it Dr. Spence deposes to information given to him by one of the doctors at the Sanitarium where the appellant was a patient. When those parts of the affidavit which are inadmissible are disregarded what remains is a statement that the deponent examined the appellant on the 18th of October, 1950, and then found him disturbed mentally and under delusions as to the proximity of the North Koreans and \u201cthat everything about him was atomic sensitive and had to be de-ionized which was accomplished by hitting the objects with an old cavalry sword\u201d and that he was acting in a violent manner and had done much damage to the contents of the dwelling house. There is nothing in the affidavit to indicate with any certainty that the deponent saw the appellant on any occasion subsequent to the 18th of October. His affidavit was sworn on the 2nd of December, 1950.\nThe affidavit of Dr. Boyer was sworn on the 6th of December, 1950. He tells of having examined the appellant on the 24th of October, 1950. He states that the appellant \u201cwas friendly but arbitrary and undoubtly psychotic,\u201d that he \u201cwas quite delusional but that there was no constancy in any delusion except the effect of electrical influences\u201d. He expresses the opinion that the appellant \u201chas a manic reaction, the cause of which is not apparent\u201d and \u201cthat he needs hospital and custodial care.\u201d There is nothing in the affidavit to indicate that the deponent saw the appellant on any date other than the 24th of October, 1950.\nBoth doctors state in their affidavits that in their respective opinions the appellant \u201cis by reason of his mental condition unable to transact ordinary business matters or to give proper consideration to the protection and conservation of his estate\u201d and that \u201cit would be inadvisable to serve on the said Douglas Guy Hobson Wright the notice of motion for the appointment of Committees of his person and estate and supporting affidavit. To do so would in all probability exaggerate his disturbed mental condition and be harmful to him.\u201d It is to be observed that neither doctor expresses the opinion that service of the papers would be attended with danger to the appellant or that he lacked the mental capacity to understand the nature of the proposed proceedings and to determine whether or not he wished to instruct counsel to oppose them. If one contrasts this material with that which was before the court in the cases of Re Patton, Re Newman and Re Mein (supra) it at once becomes apparent how far it falls short of what was required in those cases.\nThere are other matters as to which it was, I think, necessary for the court to have information which are not dealt with in the affidavits at all. The physical health of the appellant is not referred to. The cause of the alleged mental trouble is not given. Nothing is said in the way of prognosis. The court is left without information as to whether the recovery of the alleged incompetent is probable or otherwise and if probable, within what interval of time it is likely to occur. Nothing is said as to the ability or otherwise of the appellant to understand the nature of the proposed proceedings or to instruct counsel. The lack of any admissible evidence as to the condition of the appellant at any time subsequent to the 24th of October, 1950, was in itself, in my opinion, a sufficient reason for refusing to make any order.\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that if an application of this sort is to be allowed to be made ex parte it is the duty of the court to be extremely cautious to protect the person whose status and property are being dealt with without his knowledge and without his having any opportunity to make answer. Even if the statute did not, as it does, expressly require as a condition of making an order that the court be satisfied that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt the fact of mental incompetency, I would have regarded the evidence as falling far short of the minimum necessary to justify the making of an order.\nIn view of the conclusion which I have reached as to the order of December 8th it becomes unnecessary for me to deal with the order of December 22nd which would fall with the earlier order, but as I understand that I have the misfortune to differ from the other members of the court as to the order of December 8th, I desire to add that if I had been of opinion that such last\u2011mentioned order should stand I would have agreed with my brother Kellock for the reasons given by him, that paragraphs 5 and 8 (a), (b) and (d) of the report of the Master of December 14, 1950, and so much of the order of Barlow J. of the 22nd of December, 1950, and of the order of the Court of Appeal, as relates to such paragraphs, should be set aside and that the matters covered by the said paragraphs should be remitted to the Master for further consideration and I would have agreed with the order as to costs proposed by my brother Kellock.\nFor all the above reasons I would allow the appeal and set aside the order of the Court of Appeal and the orders of Barlow J. of December 8, 1950 and December 22, 1950, in toto. As the other members of the Court are of a different opinion nothing would be gained by my discussing the question as to the order which should be made as to costs in the unusual circumstances of this case.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in so far as it dismissed the appeal from the order of Barlow J. of Dec. 8, 1950, dismissed; in so far as it dismissed the appeal from the order of Barlow J. of Dec. 22,1950, allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Duncan & Bicknell.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Laura May Wright: MacDonald & MacIntosh.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Guaranty Trust Company of Canada: Mungovan & Mungovan.\n[1] (1868) 1 Ch.

The Order-in-Council was revoked at the end of 1946. On March 30, 1946 the appellant and respondent entered into a written agreement which purported the charter by the appellant to the respondent of a 4,700 ton vessel for a period of 84 months. The respondent took delivery of the ship on April 10, 1946 and operated and paid for it until April 15, 1950, when it notified the appellant that the agreement was a nullity, having been made in contravention of Order-in-Council 6785, and that it would no longer continue to operate or be responsible for the ship. The appellant thereupon brought an action for a declaration that the agreement was a valid and subsisting one, and for specific performance.\nBefore this Court it put its case on the single ground that the charter party was subject to a condition precedent that \u2022the approval of the Canadian Shipping Board under Order-in-Council 6785 should be obtained and, that Order having expired at the end of 1946, that condition dropped, leaving the charter party in full force ab initio.\nHeld: that, as Order-in-Council 6785 required that the terms of such a charter party be submitted \"in advance\" and approved by the Board and that \"no such charter party as aforesaid shall be made without such approval\"; there was no authority to give a retroactive approval. Assuming that a binding contract subject to such a condition could be made, the effect of the regulation was that no performance or execution of it could take place before that approval.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scoria in Banco[1], whereby it was held that the charter by the plaintiff to the defendant purporting to be evidenced by, and made pursuant to, the paper writing set out in the Statement of Claim (para. 4), was illegal.\nC. F. H. Carson K.C. and Allan Findlay for the appellant.\nF. D. Smith K.C. and W. H. Jost for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE: For the reasons stated by my brother Rand, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Rand, Estey, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\nRAND J.:\u2014Mr. Carson, abandoning all other points, puts his case on the single ground that the charter party was subject to the condition precedent that approval of the Canadian Shipping Board under Order-in-Council P.C. 6785, s. 9 should be obtained; and the Order-in-Council having expired at the end of December, 1946, that condition dropped, leaving the charter party in full force ab initio.\nThe Order-in-Council required that the terms of such a charter party be submitted \"in advance\" and approved by the Board and that \"no such charter party as aforesaid shall be made without such approval.\" There was no authority to give a retroactive approval. Assuming that a binding contract or charter party subject to such a condition could be made, the effect of the regulation was that no performance or execution of it could take place before that approval. Here the actual terms stipulated for the charter party to go into effect at least when possession was taken, which was on the 10th of April, 1946; and from that time until the end of the year, the charter party was de facto being executed. To say, then, that when, not that the condition became fulfilled, in fact, as it never was, but that the reason for it had been removed in law, the contract as an entirety was rendered effective, is to validate retroactively that portion of the performance, which, as it was being done, was in the face of an express prohibition of law. The charter party so made and so performed could not have been so validated. The conception of a suspension by a condition in such circumstances assumes that the whole performance remains prospective; the facts here negative that and exclude its application.\nThe question of law as put does not permit the Court to consider the possibility of a finding of the formation of a truncated charter party originating on January 1, 1947, and terminating at the end of the seven-year period. Whether the relations between the parties could be taken to be of such a distributive nature as to warrant a finding to that effect I do not therefore consider; but it was the fact that they were there of that nature which was the governing circumstance in Paoli v. Vulcan Iron Works Limited[2].\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: C. B. Smith.\nSolicitor for respondent: F. D. Smith.\n[1] [1951] 2 D.L.R. 119.\n[2] [1950] S.C.R. 114.\n"

Ltd., in a petition of right against His Majesty, for an order that it be at liberty to examine the chief engineer of the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission, as an officer of the Crown.\nGeorge Perley-Robertson for the motion.\nW. R. Jackett K.C. contra.\nKerwin J.:\u2014Leave is sought to appeal to this Court from an order of the President of the Exchequer Court made in chambers on May 15, 1951, dismissing the application of the suppliant, Coast Construction Company Limited, in a petition of right against His Majesty for an order that it be at liberty to examine Milo Bell, Chief Engineer of the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission as an officer of the Crown for the purposes of discovery. That application had been made pursuant to Rule 130 of the General Rules and Orders of the Exchequer Court which, as it stood at the time of the application, provides:\u2014\n\"Any departmental or other officer of the Crown may, by order of the Court or a Judge, be examined at the instance of the party adverse to the Crown in any action for the same purpose and before the same officers or before the Court or a Judge, if so ordered.\"\nThe present application is made under subsection 1 of section 82 of the Exchequer Court Act which, as enacted by section 2 of chapter 5 of the Statutes of 1949 (2nd Sess.), reads as follows:\u2014\n\"82(1) An appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada lies\n* * *\n(b) with leave of a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada, from an interlocutory judgment, pronounced by the Exchequer Court in an action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding, in which the actual amount in controversy exceeds five hundred dollars.\"\nFor the Crown it was argued that there was no jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal as it was contended that the order of May 15, 1951, was not \"an interlocutory judgment pronounced by the Exchequer Court\" since it was made in chambers. I do not deal with this objection as I am of opinion that in any event leave should not be given. In the petition of right it is alleged that a contract was entered into bearing date August 24, 1944, between the suppliant as party of the first part, and, as party of the second part, His Majesty the King in right of Canada, acting and represented by the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission, constituted pursuant to the Fraser River Sockeye Convention, ratified by chapter 10 of the Statutes of Canada, 1930, whereby the suppliant contracted and agreed to provide all and every kind of labour, superintendence, services, tools, implements, machinery, plant, materials, articles and things necessary for the due execution and completion of works known as the Fishway to be constructed on the Fraser River in the Province of British Columbia at Hell's Gate.\nIt is further alleged that the engineer of the Commission (admittedly Milo Bell) who was given certain powers by the contract, failed to act impartially, that he was not qualified, and that the Commission required the work to be carried on in a manner different to that contemplated in the contract so that the provisions thereof became inapplicable. The claim is then made that the fishway was fully constructed to the satisfaction of the Commission and that the suppliant should be paid on a quantum meruit basis. Alternatively, it is claimed that the provisions of the contract vesting various powers in the engineer became invalid by reason of his alleged disqualification, and that he ceased to be as between the suppliant and the Commission other than the Commission's agent, and that, as such, and in breach of the contract, he unreasonably interfered with the work in various ways for which damages are claimed, and a further claim for extras is advanced. Finally, in addition, there is a claim for damages represented by bank interest, which the suppliant alleges it was obliged to pay because of the failure of the Crown to pay certain progress certificates.\nIt was contended on behalf of the Crown that Mr. Bell was not a departmental or other officer of the Crown within the meaning of General Exchequer Court Rule 130 since, pursuant to the Convention, the Commission is composed of three members on the part of Canada and three on the part of the United States of America, and Mr. Bell was appointed by the Commission. On behalf of the suppliant, it is pointed out that in the contract \"Commission\" is defined as meaning \"His Majesty the King in right of Canada and shall include the reigning Sovereign, or the successors or assigns of the Sovereign.\" No opinion is expressed upon these contentions. No reasons were given upon the dismissal of the Suppliant's application in the Exchequer Court, and it is not to be assumed that anything was decided that would interfere with any inquiry at the trial as to whether Mr. Bell was an officer of the Crown, if such inquiry be found necessary. All that appears is that the suppliant was unsuccessful in obtaining an order for Mr. Bell's examination for discovery,\u2014without which order the suppliant could not, of course, conduct such examination. Assuming that I have jurisdiction, it is quite clear from the fact that leave of a judge of this Court is necessary, that it was never intended that decisions in the Exchequer Court on ordinary questions of practice or procedure should be subject to revision by this Court. There being nothing to indicate that anything out of the ordinary was decided on the motion in the Exchequer Court, the application is dismissed with costs.\nLeave to appeal dismissed.\n"

A trade union, certified pursuant to the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 155, as the bargaining authority for the employees of one of the employer's five restaurants, known as unit No. 5, failed to negotiate a collective agreement with the employer. Conciliation proceedings were then taken pursuant to the Act but the report made thereunder was rejected by the union. Although under the Act the union remained the bargaining agent for unit No. 5, it lost all its members among the employees therein; and none of the employees in unit 6 and 7 was a union member. The union picketed these three restaurants by having two men walk back and forth on the sidewalk in front of them each bearing a placard to the effect that the employer did not have an agreement with the union. No strike vote was taken among the employees and in fact no strike occurred. The action by the employer to enjoin this picketing and for damages was dismissed by the trial judge but was maintained by a majority in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from and restoring the judgment at the trial, that the picketing did not amount to a criminal offence or to a common law nuisance. It was authorized by s. 3 of the Trade-unions Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 342 and was unaffected by the provisions of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act.\nPer the Chief Justice and Locke J. (dissenting): The conduct complained of constituted a private nuisance which should be restrained by injunction.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , reversing, Robertson J.A. dissenting, the decision of the trial judge which had dismissed the action to enjoin the picketing and for damages.\nJohn L. Farris K.C. for the appellants.\nDavid A. Freeman for the respondent.\nThe dissenting judgment of the Chief Justice and Locke J. was delivered by:\u2014\nLOCKE J.:\u2014In this action the respondent company, the operator of five restaurants in the City of Vancouver, sought to restrain the appellant union, its officers, servants and agents from watching, besetting and picketing its premises; for a declaration that the appellants had unlawfully combined to injure the respondent in its trade by illegal means, that they had created a nuisance in and adjacent to the said premises, and for damages. On the ex parte application of the respondent supported by affidavits, Wilson, J. granted an interim injunction restraining the defendants from watching, besetting or picketing the premises until further order. On the application of the appellants to set aside the interim injunction supported by affidavits filed on the defendant's behalf, the matter was by arrangement treated as a motion for judgment and Wilson, J., while granting an injunction restraining the defendants from:\u2014\nestablishing a line about the plaintiff's places of business and from stating to prospective patrons that there is a picket line about the said places of business,\ndismissed the other claims advanced in the action. No oral evidence was taken and there was no cross-examination upon any of the affidavits.\nBy the judgment of the Court of Appeal[2] which reversed this finding, it was directed that judgment be entered in favour of the respondent:\u2014\nrestraining and enjoining the defendants from watching, besetting and picketing any of the places of business of the plaintiff and from engaging in any activity intended to restrict or limit the plaintiff's business and by directing that the plaintiff recover from the defendants damages to be assessed and by directing that the plaintiff recover from the defendant the costs of the trial and of the assessment of damages.\nThe action raises questions of great importance affecting the relations of employers of labour and trade unions and their members in the Province of British Columbia and it is necessary in determining them that there be a clear appreciation of the facts disclosed by the material.\nThe appellant union is a trade union within the meaning of that term as used in the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act (R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 155). Under the provisions of that Statute the Labour Relations Board (B.C.) on September 21, 1949, certified the union as the bargaining authority for all the employees in one of the respondent's restaurants referred to as Unit No. 5 at 2501 Granville Street in Vancouver, except those excluded by the Act. Following this, negotiations were carried on between the union and the employer for a collective agreement without result. The Board then acting under the provisions of the Statute appointed a Conciliation Officer to confer with the parties, and, no agreement being reached, a Board of Conciliation was appointed consisting of a chairman and one nominee of the employer and one of the employees. This Board met and the union presented what it said was a standard form of agreement which the employer had declined to sign. The chairman and the employer's nominee in a majority award recommended that an agreement be made between the parties, differing substantially from that thus proposed by the union. In place of a clause designated a closed shop clause by the majority but a union shop clause by the representative of the employees, the agreement recommended by the majority would embody a preferential hiring clause. The award recited that the union's representative had stated that all the members of the union who voted at the time of certification were no longer in good standing and that the union was unable to supply the necessary help, and further that, as there were no present members of the union employed in the unit, a maintenance of membership clause would have no value. It further stated that the wage rates requested by the union applied only to some twenty out of seven hundred restaurants in Vancouver and that, as the company had operated at a loss for the past year the existing rates should be continued, and in other respects recommended variations in the proposed agreement. The employees' representative delivered a minority report recommending that the standard agreement should be executed.\nAccording to an affidavit filed on the motion to dissolve the injunction made by A. R. Johnstone, the International Vice-President and General Organizer of the union, he had some further negotiations with the employer following the award of the Conciliation Board. Referring to a conversation which he had with Mr. Freeman, the solicitor for the respondent, he said that he informed the latter that the local union, having rejected the award:\u2014\nthe next natural action of Local 28 would be to request that Aristocratic operations be placed on the unfair list of the Vancouver District Trades and Labour Council,\nand that if this was done the trade unionists and their friends in the City of Vancouver would be requested not to patronize the Aristocratic operations and that:\u2014\nif the request did not have the effect that we hoped and expected that we might use the medium of picketing to bring the matter more vividly to the attention of the trade unionists in Vancouver. According to Johnstone, not having heard from the employer after a lapse of some twelve days, he:\u2014\narranged to engage in picketing activity as of May 15th.\nWhat followed thereafter is described in the affidavits filed on behalf of the respondent on the motion for the interim injunction. On the morning of May 15 two men commenced to walk back and forth in front of the two restaurants of the respondent designated as Units Nos. 6 and 7 bearing placards which read:\u2014\nAristocratic Restaurants have no union agreements with Hotel and Restaurant Employees' International Union, Local 28 affiliated with Vancouver and New Westminster Trades and Labour Council.\nThe union was not the bargaining representative of the employees in either of these restaurants. In conversation with the men engaged in what was obviously regarded both by the union and the employer as picketing, Alder Hunter, the respondent's manager, was informed that they were members of the Seamen's Union and had been told that the picketing would continue until 10:00 at night, that there were two shifts of pickets and that they were being paid at the rate of one dollar per hour for their work. Later in that day the pickets left Unit No. 7 and moved to Unit No. 5 and thereafter from 9:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. Units Nos. 5 and 6 were picketed on May 16 and 17 and on May 18 until the interim injunction was granted. There is some dispute as to the activities of the so-called pickets. Walter Jansen, the manager of the respondent's Unit No. 6, stated that he had observed the men talking to people who were apparently intending to enter the restaurant some of whom turned and went away, and on one occasion these pickets were joined by from one to three other persons who walked with them for short intervals. Another employee of Unit No. 6 said that on May 15 she had heard the pickets speaking to people coming to the door of the restaurant using words to the following effect :\u2014\nYou are not supposed to go in there. This is a picket line,\nand that the pickets commenced to accost customers in this fashion at about 8:00 p.m. that evening and a substantial number of the people approached turned away. George Cooke, one of the seamen employed by the union, however denied that he had told anyone that they were not supposed to go in to the restaurant, or words to that effect, and said that the only satement he had made was \"This is a picket line,\" except that he had answered questions directed to him by persons who first spoke to him. An affidavit by George Hotra, one of the other seamen who accompanied Cooke, was to the same effect and both of these men swore that their actions in walking back and forth along the sidewalk did not constitute an impediment to the flow of pedestrian traffic.\nWilson, J. considered that there was no evidence of a conspiracy to injure the plaintiff but, being of the opinion that to state to a man \"This is a picket line,\" suggested a state of siege or even of peril in the act of crossing the line and was unlawful, he granted an injunction against a repetition of such acts or of any acts of intimidation or coercion. In rejecting the claim of the respondent that the other actions of the so-called pickets amounted to a nuisance, he said that to establish this it would be necessary to prove not merely that these persons obstructed traffic but that they did so in such a way as to cause the plaintiff damage and that neither had been proved. The learned trial judge was further of the opinion that the actions of the appellants in the present matter, with the above noted exceptions, were in any event permitted by the provisions of section 3 of the Trade-unions Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 342, which reads as follows:\u2014\nNo such trade-union or association shall be enjoined, nor shall any officer, member, agent, or servant of such trade-union or association or any other person be enjoined, nor shall it or its funds or any such officer, member, agent, servant, or other person be made liable in damages for communicating to any workman, artisan, labourer, employee, or person facts respecting employment or hiring by or with any employer, producer, or consumer or distributer of the products of labour or the purchase of such products, or for persuading or endeavouring to persuade by fair or reasonable argument, without unlawful threats, intimidation, or other unlawful acts, such last\u2014named workman, artisan, labourer, employee or person, at the expiration of any existing contract, not to renew the same with or to refuse to become the employee or customer of any such employer, producer, consumer, or distributor of the products of labour.\nO'Halloran, J.A. expressed the view that there was nothing either in section 3 or section 4 of the Trade-unions Act which justified the form of picketing patrol employed. Dealing with a different aspect of the matter, he considered that any immunities in respect to picketing granted by the Trade-unions Act, assuming what took place here came within the meaning of that statute, were suspended by the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act until a strike vote of the employees had been taken under section 33 of that Act and the majority of the employees had voted to strike and that any such activities were prohibited until this had been done. Since the majority report of the Conciliation Board had never been submitted to the employees for their acceptance or rejection, he considered that no right to picket by anyone had arisen at the times in question and could not arise in any event until the majority vote of the employees was first obtained favouring the strike. Sidney Smith, J.A. did not consider that the matter was to be determined under the provisions of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act but, considering that at common law picketing is watching and besetting and as such illegal, said that any justification for it must be found in some statute and that there was no such justification in the Trade-unions Act. Robertson, J.A. who dissented, found that there was no nuisance committed and agreed with the learned trial judge that there was no evidence of a tortious conspiracy and that the matter was not affected by the provisions of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act. In his opinion, section 3 of the Trade-unions Act applied and was a defence to the action.\nIn my opinion, the decisive point in the case is as to whether the actions authorized by the defendants amounted in law to a nuisance causing damage to the respondent. I think it is unnecessary for the dispostion of the matter to consider whether there was evidence of a conspiracy to injure the respondent of the nature referred to in Crofter v. Veitch[3] . In the absence of other evidence than that contained in the material, if there was a nuisance it was, in my opinion, a private one. The question of nuisance or no nuisance is one of fact but as the matter was disposed of upon affidavit evidence alone, we are in an equally good position to determine that question as was the learned trial judge.\nA private nuisance is a civil wrong and in the exercise of the equitable jurisdiction of the courts its continuance may be restrained by injunction whenever substantial dam- age might be recovered in respect of it by an action at law (Crump v. Lambert[4] ). That the establishing of the patrol of pickets resulted in damage to the respondent is established by the affidavits. It is, I think, of some significance that in the reasons for judgment at the trial it is said that the actions of the pickets who warned prospective patrons that \"this is a picket line\" were unlawful and that to say this suggested a state of siege, an element of wrongfulness or even of peril in the act of crossing the line. The learned trial judge said further as to this:\u2014\nThe words, \"This is a picket line\" are words of intimidation. Pickets have no right to establish a line about an employer's place of business. This action of the picketers was unlawful and the repetition of similar acts and the doing of any acts of intimidation or coercion are enjoined.\nThe formal judgment entered following these reasons restrained the appellants from, inter alia:\u2014\nestablishing a picket line about the plaintiff's places of business and from stating to prospective patrons that there is a picket line about the said places of business.\nThere is no appeal against this portion of the judgment and indeed in the appellant's factum it is said that they had never asserted any right to so conduct themselves and never objected to an injunction in that form.\nIt is abundantly clear from the affidavit of Johnstone above referred to that he at least considered that the establishment of the patrols outside of the respondent's premises was \"picketting activity\" intended apparently, to adopt his language, to be carried on for the purpose of bringing the matter more vividly to the attention of the trade unionists in Vancouver. To trade unionists and their friends and indeed, in my opinion, to the vast majority of the people in the City of Vancouver, the establishment of the patrol, with two men constantly walking up and down outside the premises bearing these placards, would be regarded as a picket line in exactly the same manner as if the placards declared that it was a picket line, or the men carrying them told prospective customers or other persons that it was a picket line. Looking at the matter from a practical standpoint I am unable, with respect, to appreciate the distinction. In considering whether or not this conduct amounted to a private nuisance, the intention or purpose of those responsible for the conduct of the so\u2014called pickets is to be borne in mind. In Clerk and Lindsell on Torts, 10th Ed. p. 544, the learned authors essay to define nuisance thus:\u2014\nNuisance is an act or omission which is an interference with, disturbance of or annoyance to a person in the exercise or enjoyment of (a) a right belonging to him as a member of the public, when it is a public nuisance, or (b) ownership or occupation of land or of some easement, quasi-easement or other right used or enjoyed in connection with land, when it is a private nuisance.\nSalmond on Torts, 10th Ed. p. 221, says:\u2014\nThe generic conception involved in nuisance may, however, be found in the fact that all nuisances are caused by an act or omission whereby a person is unlawfully annoyed, prejudiced or disturbed in the enjoyment of land; whether by physical damage to the land or by other interference with the enjoyment of the land or with his exercise of an easement, profit or other similar right or with his health, comfort or convenience as the occupier of such land.\nAs to the nature of the damage sufficient to support the action, it is said that any such interference with the physical comfort or convenience of persons occupying the premises is a sufficient interference with the beneficial use of them upon which to found the claim. In Pollock, 14th Ed. pp. 322, 323, the learned author says that in the modern authorities nuisance includes all injuries to an owner or occupier in the enjoyment of the property of which he is in possession, and quotes Blackstone's phrase that it is \"anything done to the hurt or annoyance of the land, tenements, or hereditaments of another\" done without any lawful ground of justification or excuse. These statements by leading text book writers appear to me to accurately state the result of the authorities.\nIn determining whether or not the conduct of the appellants should be so classified, little assistance is to be obtained from the authorities. In Lyons v. Wilkins[5] , there are, however, some general statements of the law which are of assistance. Lindley, M.R. at p. 267, referring to the expression \"watching and besetting\" which appears in section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875, said that such conduct seriously interferes with the ordinary comfort of human existence and ordinary enjoyment of the house beset and would support an action at common law, referring to Bamford v. Turnley[6] ; Broder v. Saillard[7] ; and Walter v. Selfe[8] . Chitty, L.J. at 271, expressed the opinion that the conduct of the so-called pickets who use no violence or intimidation or threats constituted a nuisance and that:\u2014\nTo watch or beset a man's house for the length of time and in the manner and with the view proved would undoubtedly constitute a nuisance of an aggravated character.\nIn Quinn v. Latham[9] , Lord Lindley said that picketing is a distinct annoyance and if damage results is an actionable nuisance at common law, but that if confined merely to obtaining or communicating information it was rendered lawful by section 7 of the Act above mentioned.\nIf the matter be considered as if the rights of the parties were to be determined by the common law unaffected by statute, I think it to be clear that the conduct of the appellants amounted to a private nuisance. It is not, I think, oversimplifying the matter to consider whether such conduct would be restrained by injunction if the picketing was carried out at the private house of an employer or other person instead of at business premises. If, by way of illustration, a trade union formed for the purpose of advancing the interests of domestic servants were to organize patrols to walk up and down before the residence of a private individual who employed a servant who did not belong to the union, bearing placards stating that the individual, naming him, did not employ a member of the union, or that the person employed was not a member of the union, it cannot be doubted that such an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of his home by the owner would be restrained by injunction. The expression \"watching and besetting\" in section 501 of the Criminal Code and in section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act is not defined in either statute, and by that name does not appear to have been a criminal offence at common law. \"Watching\", as pointed out by Pallas, C.B., in Rex. v. Wall[10] , implies something more continuous and less temporary than \"merely attending\" within the meaning of that expression in the Trade Disputes Act 1906, s. 2(1). To conduct such a continuous patrol outside a man's house would, in my view, fall within the meaning of that expression. The legal meaning to be assigned to the word \"besetting\", originally a military term, appears to me to be unsettled. It is not, however, necessary that the conduct complained of should fall within the meaning of those terms as used by Lindley, M.R. in Lyons' case above referred to. To have one or more men parading up and down outside the owner's property hour after hour bearing placards with statements of this nature, however truthful, would be, in my opinion, such an interference with the comfort and convenience of the occupier of the land as a court would restrain by injunction.\nIn the case of business premises the pickets patrolling outside of the employer's premises, though merely carrying placards stating that the Aristocratic Restaurants had no agreements with the union, continuing parading throughout the day, constituted, in my opinion, a picket line and would be understood as such by the general public including members of trade unions and was intended to be such by the officers of the union, as indicated by the affidavit of Mr. Johnstone. The effect of such a picket line and the effect which it was intended to produce would be to drive away customers from the respondent's premises, both members of trade unions and their friends who would not cross a picket line and others who, seeing such a line established, would be apprehensive of crossing it, and also people who might consider that their own business or professional interests would be jeopardized by patronizing the restaurants under the eyes of the pickets. I think that, as in the case of a private house, this continuous watching of the respondent's premises by a patrol conducted in the manner described in the material was at common law a private nuisance.\nThe terms of section 3 of the Trade-unions Act of British Columbia are as above stated. The statute in substantially its present form was first enacted by the Legislature of British Columbia by chapter 66 of the Statutes of 1902, following the decision of the House of Lords in Taff Vale Railway Company v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants[11] , and presumably in consequence of it. Section 3 by its terms exempts a trade union, its officers, agents or servants from liability for communicating facts respecting employment or hiring by or with any employer to \"any workman, artisan, labourer, employee or person.\" I think it unnecessary to decide whether the \"person\" referred to is to be construed ejusdem generis with the words immediately preceding it, as to which there has been disagreement in decisions of the courts of British Columbia. While that portion of the section which excludes liability for \"persuading or endeavouring to persuade by fair or reasonable agreement without unlawful threats, intimidation or other unlawful acts\" such persons \"at the expiration of any existing contract\" does not affect the present matter, where there had been no contract, I think the concluding portion of the section reading:\nto refuse to become the employee or customer of any such employer, producer, consumer, or distributor of the products of labour.\napplies. Section 4 reads:\u2014\nNo such trade-union or association, or its officer, member, agent, or servant, or other person, shall be enjoined or liable in damages, nor shall its funds be liable in damages, for publishing information with regard to a strike or lockout, or proposed or expected strike or lockout, or other labour grievance or trouble, or for warning workmen, artisans, labourers, or employees or other persons against seeking, or urging workmen, artisans, labourers, employees, or other persons not to seek, employment in the locality affected by such strike, lockout, labour grievance or trouble, or from purchasing, buying, or consuming products produced or distributed by the employer of labour party to such strike, lockout, labour grievance or trouble, during its continuance.\nIf the appellants were justified in establishing and maintaining the picket line here complained of, the justification must be found in this legislation. While it was true that none of the employees of the respondent were members of the appellant union, it still retained its status as the bargaining authority of the employees of Unit No. 5 under the provisions of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The majority award of the Board of Conciliation was unacceptable to the union and in its capacity as bargaining representative it maintained the attitude that the standard form of agreement should be signed by the employer. I think this was a labour grievance within the meaning of that expression where used in section 4. While the affidavit of Johnstone, in which he described the reasons that led him to instruct the picketing, stated the reason as being that, as the union had standard agreements with some twenty restaurant operations in the City of Vancouver where the wage rates were considerably above those paid by the respondent and the operators of these had made representations to the union, saying that their agreements requiring them to pay a higher wage placed them at a disadvantage in competition with non-union operators:\u2014\nand that to protect the union operators and to protect the wage rates of the employees in the union shops, we were obligated to bring to the attention of the trade unionists and their friends in Vancouver the status of the various operations of the plaintiff company.\nand fails to state that they were endeavouring to advance the interests of those employees of the respondent whose bargaining representative the union was, I think it should be taken that this was one of the union's reasons for the course of action followed.\nSections 3 and 4, while exempting unions, their officers and servants from liability for communicating information of the nature described for the defined purposes, makes no attempt to define the manner in which this may be done. The British Columbia Act was followed in 1906 by the enactment in England of the Trade Disputes Act. Section 2 of that Act provided that it should be lawful for one or more persons acting on behalf of a trade union to attend \"at or near a house or place where a person resides or works or carries on business or happens to be\" if they so attend merely for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, or of peacefully persuading any person to work or abstain from working.\" Neither sections 3 or 4 of the British Columbia Act contain the above quoted language but I think, in order to give the sections a reasonable interpretation, they should be construed as if they were included. While the statements contained on the placards carried by the pickets conveyed certain information \"respecting employment or hiring by the respondent\" and the statements were true, to convey the information in the manner adopted is not, in my opinion, authorized by the statute. The language of the sections is not capable of interpretation as meaning that such information might be conveyed in a manner which would be at common law a private nuisance. Very clear language indeed would be required to justify any such invasion of the common law rights of employers and none such is to be found, in my judgment, in the Trade-unions Act. I think the injunction granted by the Court of Appeal should be continued and the appeal dismissed with costs. In the view that I take of this appeal, it is unnecessary to consider the other questions which were so fully and ably argued by counsel for both parties.\nThe judgment of KERWIN and Estey, JJ. was delivered by:\nKERWIN J.:\u2014The respondent, Aristocratic Restaurants (1947) Ltd. operates five restaurants in Vancouver known as units 5, 6 and 7. It is the plaintiff in an action in the Supreme Court of British Columbia and the defendants appellants are Robert Williams and D. P. Morrison, on behalf of themselves and all others, members of Hotel and Restaurant Employees' International Union, Local 28, and as officers and trustees of the said local, and the local itself. Williams and Morrison are respectively President and Secretary of local 28. An ex parte injunction having been granted by Wilson J., a motion before him for its dissolution was by consent treated as the trial of the action upon the pleadings and the affidavits filed. The result of that trial was as follows: (1) An injunction was granted restraining the establishing of a line about the respondent's places of business and from stating to prospective patrons that there is a picket line about the said places of business: (2) The respondent's claim to a perpetual injunction restraining the appellants and each of them, their servants and agents, from watching, besetting and picketing any of the restaurant units operated by the respondent in the City of Vancouver was dismissed. (3) The respondent's claim to a declaration that the appellants did unlawfully combine, conspire and agree with each other and others wilfully together to injure the respondent in its trade, and to advance their own interests by illegal means and to watch, beset and picket the places of business of the respondent with the intention of compelling the respondent to enter into an agreement with them, was dismissed: (4) The respondent's claim to a declaration that the appellants, their, and each of their servants or agents, have unlawfully injured the respondent in its trade, by creating a nuisance in and adjacent to the premises occupied by the respondent at the City of Vancouver, and by watching, besetting and picketing the respondent's premises was dismissed: (5) The respondent's claim to damages from the appellants was dismissed: (6) Each party was ordered to bear his own costs.\nIn the Court of Appeal[12] , Robertson J. A. would have dismissed the appeal but the majority, consisting of O'Halloran J.A. and Sidney Smith J.A. allowed the appeal with costs and the order made was that judgment be entered in favour of the respondent restraining and enjoining the appellants from watching, besetting or picketing any of the places of business of the respondent and from engaging in any activity intended to restrict or limit the respondent's business, and that the respondent recover from the appellants damages to be assessed, and that the respondent recover from the appellants the costs of the trial and of the assessment of damages. From that judgment the present appeal is taken.\nThe Court of Appeal and the trial judge do not differ as to the facts as shown by the affidavits. On September 21, 1949, pursuant to the British Columbia Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 155, hereafter referred to as the Conciliation Act, the local union was certified by the Provincial Labour Relations Board as bargaining agent for the employees of respondent's unit 5. Thereupon the local and the respondent entered into negotiations with a view to reaching an agreement concerning rates of pay and conditions of service in that unit. Upon the failure of these negotiations and following the procedure laid down in the Conciliation Act, a Board of Conciliation was appointed to try to negotiate an agreement and, failing that, to recommend terms upon which the local and the respondent should agree. No agreement was reached, and in February, 1950, majority and minority recommendations of the Board were issued. The union did not accept the majority report, nor did it hold a strike vote amongst its members who were employees in unit 5, as provided for by section 31 of the Conciliation Act and in fact no strike occurred. Either because the employees dropped their union membership, or because they resigned and were replaced by non-union workers, by May 15, 1950, no employee of unit 5 was a member of the local. While by virtue of the first sentence in subsection 7 of section 7 of the Conciliation Act, the Board might at any time cancel the certification of the union, if it was satisfied that the union had ceased to be a labour organization or that the employer had ceased to be the employer of the employees in unit 5, neither of these conditions existed. However, the second sentence of the subsection applied, by which the Board might cancel the certification of the union, but only after the expiration of ten months from its date, if the Board were satisfied that the union had ceased to represent the employees in the unit. As that period had not expired at the relevant date, the union continued to be the bargaining agent for unit 5. As to units 6 and 7, not one of the workmen therein was a union member.\nOn May 15, 1950, persons employed and paid by the local, and therefore its agents, commenced to picket not only unit 5 but also units 6 and 7. At unit 6 two men walked back and forth in front of the restaurant each carrying a placard bearing these words \"Aristocratic Restaurants have no union agreements with Hotel and Restaurant Employees' International Union, Local 28, affiliated with Vancouver and New Westminster Trades and Labour Council.\" At the same time the picketers accosted prospective customers and said to them: \"You are not supposed to go in there. This is a picket line\", or merely, \"This is a picket line\". Units 5 and 7 were also picketed by two men, in each case, but they did not address any words to prospective customers. As a result of the picketing the respondent suffered damage through a falling off in its business.\nUpon these facts the appellants admit they were not justified in establishing a picket line about respondent's place of business and in stating that there was such a line; that is, the admission is that the statement combined with the picketing was unlawful and not that peaceful picketing per se was unlawful. Reading in that way what I have described as (1) in the trial judge's order, no question arises as to its propriety. On the other hand, the third item in that order is not now disputed by respondent, that is, that there was no evidence of unlawful conspiracy on the part of the appellants. With these two clauses out of the way there still remain to be determined important questions touching the rights of labour unions and employers of labour in British Columbia.\nSo far as the criminal law is concerned, the matter is dealt with by section 501 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 36, the relevant part of which, as amended by section 12 of chapter 47 of the Statutes of 1934, reads as follows:\u2014\n501. Every one is guilty of an offence punishable on indictment or on summary conviction before two justices and liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars, or to three months' imprisonment with or without hard labour, who, wrongfully and without lawful authority, with a view to compel any other person to abstain from doing anything which he has a lawful right to do, or to do anything from which he has a lawful right to abstain,\n***\n(f) besets or watches the house or other place where such other person resides or works, or carries on business or happens to be;\n(g) attending at or near or approaching to such house or other place as aforesaid, in order merely to obtain or communicate information, shall not be deemed a watching or besetting within the meaning of this section.\nSince the appellants are not charged with having committed an offence, we are not directly concerned with this section but it is important to note that one who besets or watches within clause (f) with a view to compelling any other person to abstain from doing anything which he has a lawful right to do, or to do anything from which he has a lawful right to abstain, is guilty of an offence if he does so wrongfully and without lawful authority. In Reners v. The King[13], it was decided that such actions were wrongful and without lawful authority if they amounted to a nuisance or to a trespass or if those engaged constituted an unlawful assembly. That was before clause (g) was added by the 1934 amendment although, as appears at p. 505, because of the facts in that case, it would have had no application.\nBy chapter 111 of the Revised Statutes of British Columbia, 1948, the civil law of England as it existed on November 19, 1858, if not inapplicable from local circumstances is in force in the province but modified by all legislation having the force of law. The position in England as of 1858 was that the Statute of Labourers and the Com- bination Acts had been repealed in 1825 although the enactment of that year left unrepealed that part of the common law under which it was generally held at the time that the combination or agreement to alter conditions of work was a conspiracy because it was a combination in restraint of trade. This statute repealed one of the preceding year which had been more helpful to trade unions and workmen than the Act of 1825. Of course, the various English statutes subsequent to 1858 never were in force in British Columbia.\nThe English Trade Disputes Act of 1906 amending the 1875 Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act was anticipated in British Columbia in some respects by the Trade unions Act chapter 66 of 1902, which with immaterial verbal changes is now R.S.B.C. 1948, chapter 342. The present Act consists of four sections, of which the first merely gives the short title, and in view of the result reached we are not concerned with section 2 which deals with the nonliability for damages of trade unions and their trustees for any wrongful act in connection with any strike, lockout or trade or labour dispute except under certain conditions. Section 3 is as follows:\u2014\n3. No such trade-union or association shall be enjoined, nor shall any officer, member, agent, or servant of such trade-union or association or any other person be enjoined, nor shall it or its funds or any such officer, member, agent, servant, or other person be made liable in damages for communicating to any workman, artisan, labourer, employee, or person facts respecting employment or hiring by or with any employer, producer, or consumer or distributer of the products of labour or the purchase of such products, or for persuading or endeavouring to persuade by fair or reasonable argument, without unlawful threats, intimidation, or other unlawful acts, such last-named workman, artisan, labourer, employee, or person, at the expiration of any existing contract, not to renew the same with or to refuse to become the employee or customer of any such employer, producer, consumer, or distributer of the products of labour.\nI agree with the trial judge that the holding aloft of the placards was a \"communicating\" to \"a person\" facts respecting employment or hiring by the respondent. There is no reason that the word \"person\" should be read ejusdem generis. It is only the last part of the section, commencing with the words \"or for persuading or endeavouring to persuade\" that is related to the words \"at the expiration of any existing contract\". No opinion is expressed as to section 4 since, for its application, it would be necessary to find that there was a labour grievance or trouble although, notwithstanding the local continued to be the bargaining agent under the Conciliation Act with reference to unit 5, actually at the time of the acts complained of no member of the union was an employee of the respondent at that unit and, furthermore, it might be argued that section 4 had no relevancy to the picketing of units 6 and 7.\nThere is no question here that the appellants did not trespass or engage in an unlawful assembly but did the picketing amount to a nuisance? It could not be said that one picketer would commit a nuisance by walking up and down in front of the respondent's premises, carrying the placard and in my opinion neither did the two pickets. On this point several decisions were cited, particularly Lyons v. Wilkins No. 1[14] , Lyons v. Wilkins No. 2 [15] and Ward Lock and Company v. Operative Printers' Assistants' Society[16] . It is difficult to reconcile all the statements that appear in the several opinions expressed in these cases but I think one fact emerges and that is that the approach to labour questions has changed materially down through the years. This change of approach is evidenced particularly in the decision of the House of Lords in Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Company Limited v. Veitch[17] . Such an approach places workmen and unions in a position, comparable at least to some extent to that held by employers, and does not relegate them forever, even at common law, to the conditions existing at the time of the Statute of Labourers, the Combination Acts, the English Acts of 1824 and 1825, in 1899, or even in 1906 the date of the Ward Lock decision. It was said, at page 506 of the Reners case, that the judgments in the Ward Lock case and the Lyons case concur in the view that watching or besetting, if carried on in a manner to create a nuisance, is at common law wrongful and without legal authority. Picketing is a form of watching and besetting but that still leaves for decision, in each case, what amounts to a nuisance. Whatever might have been held some years ago, in those days the actions of the appellants did not constitute a nuisance.\nIt is argued that the provisions of the Conciliation Act affect the matter. This Act, after providing for the right of an employee to be a member of a trade union or employees' organization, and the right of an employer to be a member of an employers' organization, prohibits the latter to interfere with the formation or administration of a trade union. Then follows sections 5 and 6, to which specific reference will be made later. Subsequent sections authorize the Labour Relations Board to certify a bargaining authority, such as local 28, and provision is made for collective bargaining by agreement, and failing that, for the appointment of a Conciliation Board and sending of copies of the reports of such Board, and the prohibition of strikes or lockouts until that has been done. It is to be remembered that in the present case no strike or lockout occurred. Sections 5 and 6 read as follows:\u2014\n5. (1) Except with the consent of the employer, no labour organization and no person acting on behalf of a labour organization shall attempt at the employer's place of employment during working-hours to persuade an employee of the employer to join or not to join a labour organization.\n(2) No labour organization and no person acting on behalf of a labour organization and no employee shall support, encourage, condone, or engage in any activity that is intended to restrict or limit production.\n(3) No act or thing required by the provisions of a collective agreement for the safety or health of employees shall be deemed to be an activity intended to restrict or limit production.\n6.No person shall use coercion or intimidation of any kind that would have the effect of compelling or inducing any person to become or refrain from becoming, or to continue or to cease to be, a member of a labour organization.\nEven if it could be said that there was an attempt to persuade an employee to join a union within subsection 1 of section 5, there was no such attempt at the respondent's place of employment. The words \"during working-hours\" and in fact the whole tenor of the subsection indicate that what is aimed at are attempts in or on the employer's place of employment. The decision in Larkin v. Belfast Harbour Commissioners[18] , to which we were referred, is on an entirely different point under the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act of 1875 as amended by the Trade Disputes Act of 1906, and Larkin, without permission, addressed a crowd of workmen on a quay, the property of the Belfast Harbour Commissioners. On the evidence there is no basis in fact for the suggestion that any of the appellants supported, encouraged, condoned, or engaged in any activity that was intended to restrict or limit production within the meaning of subsection 2 of section 5 of the Conciliation Act. The matter dealt with by that subsection is an entirely different one. There was no intention to restrict or limit the preparation of meals at the restaurants in the sense that it might be said that under given circumstances certain actions were intended to slow down any manufacture. Again, as to section 6, once it is held that there was no nuisance, there is no factual foundation for the argument that the communicating, in the manner described, of the fact that the respondent had no union agreements with the union was coercion or intimidation.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal, and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nRAND J.:\u2014In this appeal the question is whether the so\u2014called picketing of the three restaurants was unlawful in the sense that it was a civil wrong. It consisted of two men walking back and forth on the sidewalk in front of a restaurant each bearing a placard to the effect that the proprietor did not have a labour agreement with a named union. The provisions of three statutes are relevant to the determination of the question, and I will deal, first with section 501 of the Criminal Code.\nThat section provides penalties against intimidation. The offence is committed by one\nwho, wrongfully and without lawful authority, with a view to compel any other person to abstain from doing anything which he has a lawful right to do or to do anything which he has a lawful right to abstain.\ndoes certain acts described in six items of particulars. The\narticle applicable here is paragraph (f):\u2014\nBesets or watches the house or other place where such other person resides or works or carries on business or happens to be,\nand it is qualified by paragraph (g):\u2014\nAttending at or near or approaching to such house or other place as aforesaid in order merely to obtain or communicate information shall not be deemed a watching or besetting within the meaning of this section.\nThis language has been taken almost verbatim from clause (4) of section 7 of the Imperial statute entitled Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875 and it has come before the English Court of Appeal for interpretation directly in at least two cases. The first was Lyons v. Wilkins reported, on the appeal from an interlocutory injunction, in (1896) 1 K.B. 811, and on the appeal from the final judgment, in (1899) 1 Ch. 255. As expressed by Lord Lindley, then Lord Justice, speaking for himself, at p. 825 in the report of 1896 it was found and held that, \"They (the defendant workmen) are there to put pressure upon Messrs. Lyons by persuading people not to enter their employment; and that is watching and besetting within clause (4), and is not attending merely to obtain or communicate information\": such conduct was a private nuisance which at common law gave rise to an action on the case. This may mean that the conduct envisaged by the proviso excludes compulsion as the object in view. If it does, then with every respect for this high authority, I am unable to follow it; unless the conduct within the exception has that object it would not be within the first part of the definition: it is assumed in determining a question under clause (4) and the proviso that there was an intention to act with a view to compel by \"attending at or near\u2026 in order\u2026 to communicate information.\" If the meaning is that the compulsion cannot be brought about by persuasion, I confess I am equally unable to follow the reasoning. For what conceivable use or purpose would information be furnished if not to win support by the persuasive force of the matter exhibited? The persuasion is not ordinarily or necessarily sought of the person to be compelled; economic pressure is to affect him; but that pressure, quite legitimate by those who exert it, may easily be set in motion by persuasion exercised upon either workmen or the public is a frequent experience of labour controversy. If \"attending at or near or approaching to such house\" for the purpose mentioned is not to be taken as a form of watching or besetting, then likewise it is outside of the penalized conduct and could not be excepted from it. It is no doubt probable that Parliament was guarding against the interpretive inclusion of doubtful conduct, but the object of compulsion remains, in any case, an essential element.\nThe word \"communicate\" signifies, as I interpret it, to pass on information at the place of attending and not subsequently at another place, and it contemplates matter lifferent from that \"obtained\" there. If \"persuading\" means to influence by the force of rational appeal, then the interpretation given the proviso, if it is to be applied in all cases without exception, seems to me to be unwarrantably restrictive; certainly it would appear to be so where the appeal is to the public, and it is not necessary to decide whether it is impossible in the case of workmen. In Lyons, the objects of persuasion were persons continuing at or seeking work in defiance of a strike, and in the special circumstances of the case it may be difficult to imagine what persuasive information could be passed on to them. But that could not be said of members of the public here. The interpretation must meet this group as well and it may be that the judgment is properly to be taken as turning on the finding that there was not in fact any real communication of information. There is nothing in the statute placing a limit of time on the \"attending\"; but there is a difference between watching and besetting for the purpose of coercing either workmen or employer by presence, demeanour, argumentative and rancorous badgering or importunity, and unexpressed, sinister suggestiveness, felt rather than perceived in a vague or ill defined fear or apprehension, on the one side; and attending to communicate information for the purpose of persuasion by the force of a rational appeal, on the other. That difference was acted upon by Wilson J. at the trial in this case in the limited injunction granted.\nIn the later case of Ward Lock v. Printers Society[19] , with substantially similar facts, the Court of Appeal in 1906 held the conduct to be within the proviso and to be unobjectionable. The section generally was interpreted to attach to certain acts, already at least tortious, certain penal consequences, but neither to add to nor diminish civil remedies. Assuming the conduct to be within the proviso, it became a question of the right or remedy at common law: that would, in any event, be the effect here under section 501. The proviso was taken to include peaceable persuasion by the communication of information in the vicinity of the premises and its inclusion in the section to be a matter of legislative caution. As persuasion, the conduct was justified by the interest of the Society in the labour dispute; and as conduct, it was not productive, to ordinary sensibilities, of that degree of annoyance, disquiet and discomfort which materially impairs the enjoyment of property. To compel by the lawful effects of such persuasion for such a purpose is a normal incident of industrial competition. The general view of the section was followed by the Court of Appeal in Fowler v. Kibble[20] .\nThere is next the Trade-unions Act of British Columbia. Section 3 absolves every person from liability for\ncommunicating to any workman, artisan, labourer, employee, or person facts respecting \u2026employment \u2026 by or with any employer\u2026 or consumer or distributor of the products of labour or the purchase of such products, or for persuading or endeavouring to persuade by fair or reasonable argument, without unlawful threats, intimidation, or other unlawful acts, such last-mentioned workman\u2026 or person, \u2026 to refuse to become the employee or customer of any such employer, consumer, distributor of the products of labour.\nThis language is seen to deal with persuasion both by spoken words and written communications. Section 4 likewise absolves the publishing of information respecting a strike or other labour grievance or trouble or for urging any person from purchasing, buying or consuming products distributed by the employer who is a party to any labour grievance or trouble. In both sections, the mode of communication and publishing is undefined, and I take the word \"person\" to include members of the public.\nThere was clearly a trade dispute as well as a grievance in this case and the information conveyed by the placards as clearly was relevant to the patronage of the restaurants by consumers. The question, then, is whether the mode of persuasion followed was authorized. How could information be effectively communicated to a prospective customer of such a business otherwise than by such means? The appeal through newspapers or at a distance might and probably would be utterly futile. The persons to be persuaded can, with any degree of certainty, be reached only in the immediate locality, and I must take the legislature to have intended to deal with the matter in a realistic manner. What was attempted was to persuade rationally rather than to coerce by insolence; there was no nuisance of a public nature, and the only annoyance would be the resentment felt almost at any act in the competitive conflict by the person whose interest is assailed. That those within the restaurant, either employees or patrons, were likely to be disturbed to the degree of apprehensive disquiet already mentioned, could not be seriously urged. Through long familiarity, these words and actions in labour controversy have ceased to have an intimidating impact on the average individual and are now taken in the stride of ordinary experience; but the information may be effective to persuade and it is such an appeal that the statute is designed to encourage.\nSince, then, the conduct was not criminal either under the Code or at common law, any common law civil liability has been removed by these sections. But even if they should not extend to a public appeal, I should hold the act innocent where it is done for such an object: the public is obviously and substantially interested in the fair settlement of such contests.\nThere remains the question whether the conduct was in violation of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act. That statute deals somewhat comprehensively with labour disputes. It provides by section 10 for the certification of a labour organization as the bargaining agent for all employees in an employment unit, and so long as that certification continues, the bargaining representative by section 13 has exclusive authority to bargain collectively on behalf of the unit and to bind it by a collective agreement. That appointment, with its investment of authority, embraces all such incidental and subsidiary authority as may be necessary to enable the labour organization to accomplish its purpose. Section 14 provides for a notice from either side for the commencement of collective bargaining; section 16 requires that the bargaining commence within five days after notice, and forbids the employer to alter any terms or condition of employment until either a collective agreement has been concluded or the report of a conciliation board has been submitted to a separate vote of employers and the employees affected. If the vote of both is in favour of acceptance, the employer is forbidden to cause a lockout and the employees to go on strike. Section 33 forbids a strike until after a vote \"of the employees in the unit affected\" has been taken and the majority have voted in favour of it. The employer and the bargaining agent were unable to conclude an agreement, and a conciliation board was appointed. Its report was made, but it was not submitted to a vote of the employees of the unit. It is said to have been rejected by a vote of the union, but as can be seen, that is quite different from a vote of the employees. Since there was no such vote, the provision of section 16 forbidding a strike did not become operative.\nIn such circumstances, then, is the action of the union in making an appeal to the public forbidden? I cannot think so. There is nothing in the Act that touches these ancillary means of advancing the interests of either party. It seems to me that the prohibitory provisions are carefully limited, and I can find no necessary implication that subsidiary action not incompatible with express provisions is intended to be affected.\nI do not take it to be obligatory to submit the conciliation report to a vote of the employees. Even where the vote is for acceptance, there is only the prohibition of a strike thereafter; the terms of the report themselves are not declared to constitute an agreement. If no vote is taken, the parties, subject to the Act, are again in negotiation with all its legitimate modes of waging the contest. To imply a ban against any of them in that unsettled situation would tend to a stalemate and to force a strike vote, both against the policy of the statute. If, by further negotiation or through persuasion, an agreement were brought about, that policy would be promoted. Once the report of the conciliation board is submitted, the parties are restricted only by the conditions of strike and lockout and, in the absence of a vote or its dispensation or of an agreement, by the maintenance of the existing terms of employment; within that area all lawful steps are open.\nThe fact that two of the restaurants were not within the unit of employees for which the union was authorized to act does not affect the question; the owner's economic strength is derived from his total business; and it is against that that the influence of information is being exerted.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the trial judgment with costs throughout. KELLOCK J.:\u2014The material facts out of which this appeal arises are as follows. On September 21, 1949, the appellant union was certified pursuant to s. 12 of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 155, as the bargaining authority for the respondent's employees in \"Unit No. 5,\" one of a group of five restaurants operated by the respondent in the City of Vancouver. The union thereupon made certain demands upon the respondent, including a demand for a union shop, and submitted for execution by the respondent its standard form of agreement. As the respondent did not accede to the union's requests, conciliation proceedings were taken in pursuance of the statute, resulting in February 1950 in majority and minority reports.\nThe points of difference related to wage rates and the question of union shop. The respondent accepted the award, but the union at its meeting in the month of March rejected it.\nSubsequently, during the month of April and into the month of May, the parties carried on negotiations, the union insisting on the substance of the minority report. Ultimately the union advised the respondent that its next step, failing agreement, would be to request that the respondent be placed on the \"unfair list\" of the Vancouver District Trades and Labour Council, which meant that trade unionists in the city would be requested not to patronize the respondent. The union further advised the respondent that if this did not have the desired result, \"picketing\" might be resorted to. Some discussion took place as to the possibility of a joint survey of the respondent's operations being made by representatives of both parties for the purpose of seeing if improvements in the respondent's operations could be brought about, but when nothing came of this, the union commenced the activities which are the immediate subject of this litigation. Briefly, commencing on the 15th of May, 1950, two men began walking back and forth on the public street in front of three of the respondent's five restaurants, carrying placards bearing the following words:\nAristocratic Restaurants have no union agreements with Hotel and Restaurant Employees International Union Local 28, affiliated with Vancouver and New Westminster Trades and Labour Council. It is admitted on behalf of the appellant that the purpose of these activities was to bring pressure to bear upon the respondent to accede to the demands of the union through loss of custom which it was hoped would result. It is in evidence that there was some accosting of persons on the street, apprising them that \"this is a picket line,\" but an injunction was granted with respect to this latter activity, and no question arises with respect to it on this appeal. The conduct complained of continued from May 15 to May 18 when the writ was issued. The learned trial judge dismissed the action, but his judgment was reversed on appeal[21] , Robertson J.A. dissenting.\nIt is provided by s. 12, subsection 2 of the statute already referred to, that where a labour organization applies for certification as a bargaining authority for a \"unit,\" if the board has determined that a \"unit\" is \"appropriate for collective bargaining,\" and is satisfied that the majority of the employees in the unit are members in good standing of the labour organization, the board shall certify the applicant as the bargaining authority of the employees in the unit. Subsection 3 of s. 12 provides that, for the purposes of the statute, a \"unit\" means simply a group of employees. Accordingly, the appellant, by reason of the certification, became the bargaining authority for the group of employees of the respondent's restaurant No. 5, and it is clear, by reason of the provisions of s. 12 that at the date of certification, the board was satisfied that the majority of this group were members in good standing of the appellant union. It is provided by s. 13 that where a bargaining authority is certified for a unit, that bargaining authority \"shall have exclusive authority to bargain collectively on behalf of the union and to bind it by a collective agreement until the certification is revoked.\"\nS. 12, subsection 7 provides for the revocation of certification in the following cases: (a) if the board is satisfied that the labour organization has ceased to be such, or (b) that the employer has ceased to be the employer of the employees in the unit, or (c) if ten months have elapsed after certification and the board is satisfied that the labour organization has ceased to represent the employees in the unit. It appears from the report of the conciliation board that, at the time of the hearings before it, all the employees of the unit who had been members of the appellant union at the date of the certification, had since ceased to be members. This fact, however, is not one of the circumstances which, under the statute, affect the status of the appellant union as the certified bargaining agent, and as ten months had not elapsed after certification, the provisions of s. 12, subsection 7 do not apply. It is not shown that there was any change in the personnel of the group at any time after certification. Accordingly, the appellant union continued to have the exclusive right to bargain collectively on behalf of the group of employees concerned, and to bind them by a collective agreement as provided by s. 13 (a).\nBy s. 2, subsection 1, \"collective bargaining\" is defined as negotiating with a view to the conclusion of a collective agreement or the renewal thereof, or to the regulation of relations between an employer and employees, and it is provided by s. 14 that where the board has certified a bargaining authority for employees in a unit and no collective agreement is in force, the bargaining authority may by notice require the employer to \"commence\" collective bargaining.\nIt is contended on behalf of the respondent, that because there were no members of the appellant union remaining in the group of employees in question at the time of the award of the conciliation board, it would have been out of the question for the board to have acceded to the union's demand that an agreement should have been settled containing a union shop clause, as it would have meant that after a limited period, which respondent's counsel suggested might be six months, the respondent would have been obliged to discharge all employees in the group who were unwilling to become members of the union. Counsel further contends that when the appellant union continued to insist on such a term in the negotiations occurring subsequent to the conciliation award, it in effect repudiated its true function under the statute as agent for the employees in the group, and became a protagonist in its own interests as distinct from theirs.\nI am unable to accede to this view. In my opinion, it breaks down on the facts. It is in evidence that the original instructions of the appellant union included a demand for a union shop clause, and it does not appear that these instructions were at any time countermanded or altered. Further, it is provided by s. 8 of the statute that nothing therein is to be construed as precluding the insertion in a collective agreement of a provision requiring, as a condition of employment, membership in a specific labour organization.\nI therefore conclude that, at the time of the activities in question, the appellant union retained exclusive authority to negotiate with respect to the conclusion of a collective agreement or with respect to the regulation of relations between the respondent and the group of employees in question.\nThe respondent refers to s. 16 (b) of the statute, which prohibits an employer from increasing or decreasing rates of wages or from altering any term or condition of employment until after the conciliation board has reported to the Labour Relations Board and until the question of acceptance or rejection of the award has been submitted to a vote of the employees affected, and seven days have elapsed after the vote has been reported to the Labour Relations Board. The respondent contends that, as there was no vote in the present case, the employer was prohibited from acceding to the union's demands and consequently the activities of the union designed to have the employer accede to these demands, involved something which the respondent was prohibited by statute from doing. It is therefore said that the activities in question were wrongful.\nClause (c) of s. 16, however, provides that the Labour Relations Board may make regulations authorizing an employer affected by clause (b) to increase or decrease wages or alter any term or condition of employment. Consequently, the respondent, had it seen fit, might have applied to the Board for such purpose, and that being so, I do not think it can be said that it was wrongful for the union to have taken steps to induce the respondent so to do.\nIn the opinion of O'Halloran J.A.[22], what the appellants had done was specifically prohibited, in the circumstances, by s. 5(2) of the statute. Robertson J.A. was of a contrary opinion. In a sense, to induce customers not to buy will have the effect of limiting the output of the person from whom the buying might otherwise take place, but I do not think that the subsection is directed at the sort of thing in question here, nor, in any event, could it reasonably be interpreted so as to conflict with the express provisions of ss. 3 and 4 of the Trade-unions Act, R.S.B.C. 1948 c. 342, with which I will subsequently deal.\nThis brings me to the question as to whether or not the picketing here in question gave rise to any cause of action on the part of the respondent. This resolves itself, in the present instance, into the question as to whether or not such conduct was, in itself, unlawful. The learned trial judge held that this conduct did not amount to a common law nuisance, and in any event, was authorized by s. 3 of the Trade-unions Act. In the Court of Appeal[23] , Robertson J.A. was in substantial agreement with the learned trial judge. In the view of the majority, however, the respondents were guilty of a watching and besetting illegal at common law and not authorized by the provisions of the statute just referred to.\nWith respect to ss. 3 and 4 of the statute, it is not possible to peruse the course of legislation with respect to picketing, and the decisions thereunder, without concluding that the draftsman had in mind their subject matter, but the rather odd thing is that in neither of the sections is \"watching or besetting\" expressly referred to. Before considering these sections further, however, it would seem relevant to refer to the history of the legislation.\nIt is not necessary to go farther back than the Canadian Act of 1872, 35 Vict. c. 31, which, so far as material, reproduces the essential provisions of the English statute of 1871, 34-35 Vict. c. 32. By s. 1 every person who\n3. molests or obstructs any person in manner defined by this section\u2014\n***\n(e) being a master, to alter the mode of carrying on his business, or the number or description of any persons employed by him\u2014\nshall be guilty of an offence and punishable by imprisonment. Subsection 4 provides that for the purposes of the statute, a person shall be deemed to molest or obstruct another person if\n(c) he watches or besets the house or place where such other person resides, or works, or carries on business, or happens to be, or the approach to such house or place\u2026 In his charge to the grand jury in the Cabinet-Makers' Case, reported in a note in (1899) 1 Ch. at 262, the late Mr. Russell Gurney said, in terms described by Lindley M.R. in Lyons v. Wilkins[24] , as \"a masterly statement of the law as it stood in April 1875\":\nAnd here you must observe that the question is, not whether they have endeavoured to take their stand by themselves refusing to work, and by persuading others not to work: this they have a right to do; but the question is whether they have tried to effect that object in a way that is forbidden by the Act, and with that purpose. That they did watch the place of business, probably, there is no doubt, but there are some purposes for which they had a perfect right to watch. When a contest of this sort is going on, it is not unusual, I believe, to watch, in order to see that none of the men who receive what is called \"strike pay\", are also receiving wages from the employer. But the more important object, no doubt, that the watchers had in view was, to inform all comers when, for instance, any might have been attracted to come there by the advertisements which had been inserted in the newspapers to inform them of the existence of the strike, and endeavour to persuade them to join them. All this is lawful so long as it is done peaceably, without anything being done to interfere with the perfect exercise of free will on the part of those who were otherwise willing to work on the terms proposed by the employer.\nIn the following August, the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, 38-39 Vict. c. 86, was passed, repealing the Act of 1871 and enacting s. 7 as follows:\nEvery person who, with a view to compel any other person to abstain from doing or to do any act which such other person has a legal right to do or abstain from doing, wrongfully and without legal authority\u2014\n***\n4. watches or besets the house or other place where such other person resides, or works, or carries on business, or happens to be, or the approach to such house or place\u2026\nshould, on conviction, be liable to a penalty. The section was subject to a proviso that\nAttending at or near the house or place where a person resides, or works, or carries on business, or happens to be, or the approach to such house or place, in order merely to obtain or communicate information, shall not be deemed a watching or besetting within the meaning of this section.\nThis legislation had its counterpart in Canada in 39 Vict. c. 37, s. 2. It is apparent that while attending to obtain or communicate information was expressly authorized in accord with the construction of the earlier statute referred to above, persuasion, even though by peaceful means, was not ex- pressly mentioned. Following this statute, Regina v. Bauld[25] was decided, and it was held by Baron Huddleston that watching and besetting for the purpose of persuading was not permitted. In Lyons v. Wilkins, No. 1[26], the same view was taken by the Court of Appeal, which held that any conduct going beyond that described in the proviso to s. 7 was expressly prohibited by the statute.\nIn Lyons v. Wilkins, No. 2[27], which was the same case as the above but after trial, the first decision having been on a motion to continue an injunction, it was argued for the defendants that \"watching and besetting\" under the Act of 1875 should have the same meaning as in the Act of 1871, so as not to prohibit peaceful persuasion. It was contended that the proviso to s. 7 was merely put in \"ex majori cautel\u00e2\" and was not an instance of \"expressio unius exclusio est alterius.\" It was also argued that, by reason of the presence in the statute of the word \"wrongfully,\" it must be shown, apart from the statute, that some legal right of the plaintiff had been infringed by the acts complained of. These arguments, however, were expressly rejected.\nWith respect to the argument founded on the words, \"wrongfully and without legal authority,\" Lindley M.R. was of opinion that it was not necessary to show the illegality of the overt acts complained of by evidence other than that which proved the acts themselves, if no justification or excuse for them was reasonably consistent with the facts proved. That this was the correct construction was, in his Lordship's view, clear from the fact that under subsection 1 of the section,\nuses violence to or intimidates such other person or his wife or children, or injures his property.\nsuch acts were wrongful in themselves. Accordingly, the words in question were superfluous with respect to the acts described in subsection 1, and in order to construe the various subsections consistently, it must be held that the statute intended to prohibit the conduct described in each subsection, if done with the view mentioned in the beginning of the section. The same view was taken by Chitty L.J. In the view of the majority, therefore, these words meant \"without lawful excuse or justification.\" On the other hand, Vaughan Williams L.J. was of opinion that the words meant \"unwarranted by law.\" Notwithstanding, however, the learned judge took the same view as did the majority insofar as the subsection dealing with watching or besetting was concerned, in that he expressly held that the statute rendered illegal all watching and besetting which could not be brought within the proviso. He said at p. 273:\nThen came the Act of 1875, which, in my opinion, is intended to define what kind of watching and besetting shall in future be warranted by law; and the definition, in my opinion, means that watching and besetting shall in future be confined to \"watching and besetting merely for the purpose of obtaining or communicating information.\"\u2026\nIf the persuading takes any other shape than that of a communication within the meaning of the proviso contained in s. 7, this would, in my opinion, make it unwarranted by this section, even though this persuasion might not otherwise be of such a character as to constitute a nuisance at common law. And, even if the persuasion does take the shape of such a communication, yet it may be made in such a manner as to constitute a common law nuisance, and thus be wrongful.\nHe also said:\nI think that the fact that the communication invites the men to discontinue working for the master as soon as they lawfully may does not thereby cause the communication to cease to be a communication within the meaning of the proviso.\nWhile Lindley M.R. and Chitty L.J. considered that the conduct in question in the case constituted a common law nuisance, Vaughan Williams L.J. was of a contrary opinion.\nThis legislation was again considered in 1906 by the Court of Appeal in Ward Lock & Company v. Operative Printers' Assistants Society[28] , the court, consisting of Vaughan Williams, Stirling and Fletcher Moulton L.JJ., taking, in my opinion, a fundamentally different view of the statute from that taken in the Lyons Case. Vaughan Williams L.J. in the Ward Lock Case, said at p. 329:\nWhen the Act of 1875 was passed, the employers had a good cause of action for various forms of nuisance. The Legislature, by the Act of 1875, gave in respect of some of these nuisances, as to which there was a civil remedy, a summary remedy by summons before a magistrate for acts done for which there was previously only a civil remedy. And it seems to me that the words in the first clause of the section, \"wrongfully and without legal authority,\" were introduced for the very purpose of limiting the remedy by criminal prosecution to cases so tortious as to give a civil remedy. I find it impossible to reconcile this statement with the statement of the same learned judge in the Lyons Case quoted above:\nIf the persuading takes any other shape than that of a communication within the meaning of the proviso contained in s. 7, this would, in my opinion, make it unwarranted by this section, even though this persuasion might not otherwise be of such a character as to constitute a nuisance at common law.\nAlthough Fletcher Moulton L.J. expressed himself as following the authority of Lindley M.R. in the Lyons Case, reaching his conclusion, as he said, by a different route, I am, with great respect, unable to appreciate any agreement between the two as to the proper construction of the statute.\nIn Reners v. The King[29] , upon evidence involving trespass, a conviction for picketing was upheld. Both the Lyons Case and the Ward Lock Case, as well as the later case of Fowler v. Kibble[30] , were considered, and in the opinion of the majority, the decisions in the Lyons and Ward Lock Cases concurred in the view that watching or besetting, if carried on in a manner to create a nuisance or otherwise unlawfully, constituted an infraction of the statute. That was sufficient for the case in hand. It is to be observed that the proviso as to attending &c. for the purpose of obtaining or communicating information was not in the Criminal Code at the time of this decision, it having been dropped when the Code was enacted in 1892. It was, however, re-enacted in 1934 and is now part of s. 501 (g) of the Code, which reproduces in substance s. 7 of the English statute of 1875.\nSo far as the English authorities are concerned, it may be significant that, shortly after the decision in the Ward Lock Case, the Act of 1875 was amended. By 6 Ed. VII c. 47, the proviso in s. 7 was repealed and it was enacted that it should be lawful to attend not only for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, but also for the purpose of peacefully persuading any person to work or abstain from working.\nIn this state of the authorities I come back to the Trade-unions Act. S. 3 exempts the unions, their members, etc., from liability to injunction or damages for\ncommunicating to any workman, artisan, labourer, employee or person facts respecting employment or hiring by or with any employer, producer or consumer or distributor of the products of labour or the purchase of such products, or for persuading or endeavouring to persuade by fair or reasonable argument, without unlawful threats, intimidation, or other unlawful acts, such last-named workman, artisan, labourer, employee or person, at the expiration of any existing contract, not to renew the same or to refuse to become the employee or customer of any such employer, producer, consumer, or distributor of the products of labour.\nWhile the section covers communication of information and use of persuasion, the authority conferred by the section is expressly conferred apart from \"unlawful acts,\" which leaves open the question as to the legality of the means employed in the communication or persuasion.\nAs already mentioned, the conduct in question in the case at bar has been found by the learned trial judge and by the learned dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal, not to amount to a common law nuisance, and in that opinion I respectfully concur. No other illegality in connection with the activity carried on is alleged apart from the provisions of s. 501 of the Criminal Code, and, in my opinion, the conduct here in question falls squarely within the provisions of paragraph (g) Insofar as the statement contained on the signs carried by the pickets was intended to persuade customers or prospective customers not to deal with the respondent, I would agree with the view expressed by Vaughan Williams L.J. in Lyons v. Wilkins, No. 2, with respect to the invitation contained in the signs in question in that case, which I have quoted above. Accordingly, it is not necessary to consider the question as to whether a breach of s. 501 could form the basis for a civil suit. The contrary appears to have been the opinion of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in an analogous situation; Transport Oil Company v. Imperial Oil Company[31] .\nIn my opinion, therefore, on the facts proved, s. 3 of the statute affords express authority for what was done by the appellants in the case at bar. Should the proper construction of the section require that the word \"person,\" where used therein the third and fourth times, be read ejusdem generis, I know of no ground upon which the signs would become unlawful, merely because in the ordinary course of events, others might also read them.\nIn the result, therefore, I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge, with costs here and below. CARTWRIGHT J.\u2014The relevant facts of this case are sufficiently stated in the judgments of other members of the Court and do not require repetition.\nI am in agreement with the view that the conduct described in the record cannot be said to be criminal, being saved by clause (g) of section 501 of the Criminal Code. It remains to be considered whether it is actionable and so liable to be restrained by injunction.\nThose portions of the judgment of the learned trial judge against which no appeal was taken restrain the defendants \"from establishing a line about the plaintiff's places of business and from stating to prospective patrons that there is a picket line about the said places of business.\" The judgment of the Court of Appeal[32], in addition to this would restrain the defendants \"from watching, besetting or picketing any of the places of business of the plaintiff and from engaging in any activity intended to restrict or limit the plaintiff's business\" and would award the plaintiff damages to be assessed.\nIt does not seem to me to be necessary or desirable to attempt to formulate general rules which will be applicable to all cases, and I propose to confine myself to a consideration of the facts of this particular case.\nWhat is complained of is the fact that two paid agents of the defendant Union, continuously through the hours during which the plaintiff's places of business were open, walked up and down the highway outside such places of business carrying placards bearing the following words:\u2014\nAristcratic Restaurants have no Union agreements with Hotel and Restaurant Employees' International Union, Local 28, affiliated with Vancouver and New Westminster District Trades and Labour Council.\nIt appears from the material before the Court that the actions of these agents at no time impeded traffic or interfered with the free and usual use of the highway in such manner as would constitute a public nuisance. It is not suggested that the statements on the placards were not true. It appears from the material that the activities of the defendants' agents caused a falling off in the plaintiff's business and thereby caused damage to the plaintiff. It is conceded that this result was intended by the defendants. For the respondent it is argued that at common law, on the facts stated, the plaintiff would have had a cause of action for a private nuisance. It is said that the conduct of the defendants, mentioned above, resulted in a continuous injury to the plaintiff in the enjoyment of the property of which it is in possession causing it annoyance, inconvenience and actual damage and that, while the defendants' intention may not be material in determining the existence of a nuisance, the intention to injure will be a factor to be considered by the Court in determining whether or not to award an injunction where a nuisance has been held to exist.\nI do not think it necessary to decide whether the acts of the defendants would have amounted to an actionable private nuisance at common law. I will assume, for the purposes of this appeal, that they would have done so, but I think it clear that but for the circumstance of the carrying of the placards no nuisance could have been found to exist. It was the conveyance of the information on the placards to the members of the public using the highway, including the prospective patrons of the plaintiff, which caused the annoyance, inconvenience and damage of which complaint is made and on the facts of this case it appears to me that without the conveyance of such information there would have been neither nuisance nor damage.\nHaving reached this conclusion it seems to me that whether or not the conduct complained of would have been actionable at common law the right of action in this particular case is expressly taken away by section 3 of the Trade-unions Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 342. The section reads as follows:\u2014\n3. No such trade-union or association shall be enjoined, nor shall any officer, member, agent, or servant of such trade-union or association or any other person be enjoined, nor shall it or its funds or any such officer, member, agent, servant, or other person be made liable in damages for communicating to any workman, artisan, labourer, employee, or person facts respecting employment or hiring by or with any employer, producer, or consumer or distributer of the products of labour or the purchase of such products, or for persuading or endeavouring to persuade by fair or reasonable argument, without unlawful threats, intimidation, or other unlawful acts, such last-named workman, artisan, labourer, employee, or person, at the expiration of any existing contract, not to renew the same with or to refuse to become the employee or customer of any such employer, producer, consumer, or distributer of the products of labour. I agree with my brother Rand that the word \"person\" as used in the section includes members of the public. I cannot read the words of the section as limited to cases where the conduct of the persons engaged in communicating facts would not be actionable at common law. In such cases no statutory protection or immunity would be required, and the section must be construed, if possible, as serving some useful purpose. Its purpose seems to me to be to provide that the communication of facts, by those mentioned in the section, shall not be actionable whether or not such communication would but for the section have been actionable. The section does not, in my opinion, render lawful any conduct which would be unlawful without the element of the communication of facts, such as, for example, trespass, nuisance or the publication of false statements, but, in the case at bar, as I have already indicated, it seems to me that but for the communication of the facts stated on the placards, the conduct of the defendants would not have been actionable at common law and the Legislature has seen fit to confer immunity from action upon the making of such communications. If the sum total of the conduct of the defendants minus the element of the communication of the information on the placards could be shown to be actionable then, in my opinion, the section would not assist them, but since this cannot be shown, I think they are protected. The fact that in this particular case the plaintiff appears to have suffered a grave hardship can not affect the duty of the Court to give effect to the words of the statute.\nFor the reasons given by my brother Kellock I agree with him that the conduct of the defendants is not rendered illegal by the provisions of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act.\nI would allow the appeal with costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Farris, Stultz, Bull and Farris.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Freeman, Freeman and Silvers.\n[1] [1951] 1 D.L.R. 360.\n[2] [1951] 1 D.L.R. 360.\n[3] [1942] A.C. 438.\n[4] (1867) L.R. 3 Eq. 409.\n[5] (1899) 1 Ch. 255.\n[6] (1860) 3 B. & S. 62.\n[7] (1876) 2 Ch.

After meeting him and having coffee with him, they asked him to come to the barracks relative to a personal matter. He agreed. There they told him that the girl was in a serious condition and that in all probability serious charges would arise out of it against him. He was then given the usual warning and the statement was elicited by detailed questions, a form suggested by the accused.\nThe Crown appealed, but the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta affirmed the rejection of the statement.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (Estey J. dissenting), that there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could properly find that the Crown had not shown affirmatively that the statement had been given voluntarily, without inducement, and that, in the determination of that question, the trial judge had not misdirected himself.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division 1, confirming, O'Connor C.J.A. and Parlee J.A. dissenting, the acquittal of respondent on a charge of abortion.\nH. J. Wilson K.C. for the appellant.\nA. Macdonald K.C. and G. J. Gorman for the respondent.\nKerwin J.:\u2014Assuming that we have jurisdiction, I have come to the conclusion that there was evidence before Shepherd J. upon which he could find that the Crown had not shown affirmatively that the confession of the appellant was voluntary in the sense that it was made without inducement.\nThe appeal should be dismissed. The judgment of Rand and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014The case of Rex v. Boudreau 2, has laid down the rule to be applied in the case of confessions: was the statement freely and voluntarily made. That means, I think, was it made by one whose mind and will were disposed to the making of it free from any real influence exerted upon them by any direct or indirect inducement of hope or fear held out by a person in authority. We have not complicated that by consideration of the relative weights of the inducement and its alternatives in producing a false as distinguished from a truthful admission.\nThe only question in the appeal is whether Shepherd J. had evidence before him on which he could properly find that the Crown had not shown affirmatively that the mind and will of the accused were so free and whether, in any manner, in his determination of the question, he misdirected himself. The significant circumstances are these: the police officers, advised that the young woman was in the hospital and in a serious condition and that the accused was suspected of being responsible, had been sent out to obtain whatever information they could from him. They approached him under the cloak of an admitted familiar acquaintance; they had coffee with him and tossed a coin to see who would pay for it; the opening question at their quarters was, \"Do you know that your girl friend, Betty, is in the hospital in a serious condition\", followed by \"in all probability serious charges will arise out of it against you\"; the statement was elicited by detailed questions, a form suggested by the accused. These to me furnish ample matter, first, from which to draw the inference that there was an indirect inducement, and, secondly, that its effect had not been removed by the formal warning. Since the officers were out to obtain information from him, what other possible object could the reference to the likelihood of charges have had than to exert upon him a coercive pressure to disclose what he knew? And how can it be said that he might not take that to imply that it would be better for him to do so? To suggest that it was a friendly warning to be circumspect or on guard would falsify the object which they were instructed to and did pursue to the end. I think the trial judge could properly have made the finding he did. Although the word \"discretion\" is used in some of the cases, I am unable to see the appropriateness of the term to that finding: but having sufficient facts before him and not misdirecting himself as to the requirements of the rule, his finding ought not to be interfered with. I would dismiss the appeal.\nEstey J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal on behalf of the Attorney-General of Alberta, under sec. 1023(3) of the Criminal Code, from a majority judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta 3 affirming the dismissal of a charge preferred under sec. 303 of the Criminal Code.\nIn the course of the trial, when counsel for the Crown tendered a statement made by the accused, the trial judge, in the absence of the jury, heard evidence of the circumstances under which that statement had been obtained. At the conclusion of this \"trial within a trial\" he held that he was not satisfied that the statement had been voluntarily made within the meaning of the law. Counsel for the Crown at once intimated that apart from the contents of the statement the evidence did not justify his proceeding. The learned trial judge accordingly directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty. This the jury did and the charge was dismissed.\nIn the course of the police investigation a sergeant directed two constables, Sargent and Thompson, to interview the accused, with whom they were acquainted. They met him about mid-afternoon and asked him to come to the barracks relative to a personal matter. He agreed. They all three had coffee at a corner caf\u00e9 and then proceeded to the barracks at the Court House. There they went into the Court Room and for the first time this matter was discussed. Thompson said to the accused:\n\"Freddie, did you know that your girl friend Betty was in the hospital?\"\nand upon his replying that he did not Thompson said:\n\"Well, she is in the hospital and she is in serious condition\", and that there were serious charges likely to arise from her condition, charges against him because of her condition. Thompson then gave the usual warning and continued:\nI explained it to him a little more simpler. I told him that he didn't have to say anything if he didn't wish to and that there was nothing that myself or Constable Sargent could do or say to him that could influence him or make him make any statement or make him say anything if he didn't wish to do so, and I asked him if he understood the meaning of the warning and he replied that he did fully. Following this we sat for a moment or two, none of us saying anything, and the accused had his head bowed and after a moment or two he looked up and he said, \"I didn't want to do it, she is the one who wanted it done.\"\nNothing was then said for another moment or two when Thompson said:\n\"Fred, how long have you been going with Betty?\"\nto which the accused replied:\n\"One year now and six months before.\"\nThen, after a further short silence, Thompson asked:\n\"Where did you get the stuff, Fred?\", and he replied, \"At the Sterling Drug Store.\"\nThen Thompson said:\n\"Well, do you wish, would you like to make a statement covering this business, Fred?\"\nThe accused paused for a moment and said:\n\"Yes, I might as well.\"\nThe accused then said he did not know how to begin, or words to that effect, and Thompson said:\n\"Well, in that ease I might be able to ask you questions to help you to make your statement.\"\nThompson says he again told him that the\nstatement must be purely voluntary and in your own words and must be taken down as such, that I didn't want to ask him any questions that might lead him to, if I asked him any questions it would be in such a way it might help him to make his statement.\nThe constable then proceeded to ask questions and to put these and the answers in writing. When the statement was completed the accused read it through. He was asked if there were any mistakes or errors he desired to correct and, upon his reply that everything seemed all right, he was asked to, and did sign it.\nThe constables took the statement to the sergeant who had detailed them to make the investigation. While there Thompson was advised that the accused, who had remained in the Court Room, desired to see him. Thompson returned at once to the Court Room, where the accused expressed the desire to, and did dictate another paragraph, which he read over and signed. Thompson then returned to the sergeant's office, where the matter was discussed and a decision arrived at to lay a charge against the accused contrary to sec. 303.\nThe statement was not marked as an exhibit, nor was it read by the learned trial judge, and was, of course, neither before the Appellate Division nor this Court.\nAt the conclusion of this evidence the learned trial judge stated:\nOne thing that worries me here, Mr. Moyer (counsel for the accused), is the statement to the accused by Thompson that serious charges are going to be laid against you, are likely to be laid against you arising out of what has happened to this woman \u2026 Well, is it an inducement or a threat? Aside from that, Mr. Moyer, I can't see anything to keep this statement out.\nThe argument continued, in which both counsel for the Crown and the accused took part, at the conclusion of which the learned trial judge stated, in part, as follows:\nNo, viewing this thing as widely as I can, giving it serious consideration, Mr. Read, you have not convinced me that this confession was gotten out of this Accused freely and voluntarily on the grounds that we have been discussing, in particular the statement of the Police Officer to him, \"Serious charges are likely to be laid against him arising out of what has happened to this young woman,\" that coupled with the method in which the information contained in that statement was elicited, that is by questioning him. I appreciate these things do present difficulties, but they must be solved in favour of an Accused where the Court is in doubt, and I do feel very much in doubt, and I must resolve it in his favour, I would not for a moment suggest any censure of the Police Officers, none whatever, but I think the method they undertook was in error.\nIn the Appellate Division the rejection of this statement in evidence was affirmed by a majority of the learned judges. Mr. Justice Parlee, with whom Chief Justice O'Connor agreed, dissented and was of the opinion the learned trial judge should have received the statement and would have directed a new trial.\nThe appeal to this Court, being under sec. 1023(3) of the Criminal Code, is restricted to a question of law upon which there has been a dissent in the Appellate Court. Steinberg v. The King 4; Rex v. D\u00e9cary 5.\nMr. Macdonald, counsel for the accused, contends that whether a statement is voluntary within the meaning of the law is a question of fact or the exercise of a discretion upon the part of the trial judge and, therefore, cannot be raised as a question of law under sec. 1023(3). Mr. Wilson, on behalf of the Attorney-General, contends that it is a question of law and properly raised within the meaning of that section.\nA confession or statement which may tend to prove the guilt of an accused party is admissible in evidence if it be affirmatively proved by the Crown that it was made voluntarily in the sense that it was not obtained by fear of consequence or hope of benefit held out by one in authority.\nWhen such a statement is tendered in evidence at a trial the judge will at once hear the evidence of the circumstances surrounding the making of the confession as tendered by both parties. If it be a jury trial, this trial within a trial will be conducted in the absence of the jury. The judge must be there satisfied that the Crown has, by the evidence adduced, affirmatively proved that the statement, having regard to all of the circumstances, was voluntarily made. If so satisfied, he will find as a fact that the statement was voluntarily made and admit it as evidence; if not, he will reject it. His conclusion may often depend upon which of the witnesses he believes, upon weighing the evidence and construing both oral and written statements. It cannot be said to be a question of law, but rather a question of fact or of mixed law and fact.\nIn The Queen v. Thompson 6, Cave J. states the question that has been so often judicially approved:\nIs it proved affirmatively that the confession was free and voluntary\u2014that is, was it preceded by any inducement to make a statement held out by a person in authority? If so, and the inducement has not clearly been removed before the statement was made, evidence of the statement is inadmissible.\nThat was a decision under the Crown Cases Act 1848 (11 & 12 Vict., c. 28) where a case could be reserved upon \"any question of law which shall have arisen on the trial.\" The evidence adduced before the magistrates did not remove the possibility that the inducement or threat made by a party in authority to a brother and brother-in-law of the accused had not been communicated to him and, therefore, as stated by Cave J. on behalf of the Court at p. 18:\n\u2026 it is the duty of the prosecution to prove, in case of doubt, that the prisoner's statement was free and voluntary, and that they did not discharge themselves of this obligation.\nIn Ibrahim v. Rex 7, Lord Sumner stated at p. 610:\nWith Reg. v. Thompson ((1893 2 Q.B.D. 12) before him, the learned judge must be taken to have been satisfied with the prosecution's evidence that the prisoner's statement was not so induced either by hope or fear, and, as is laid down in the same case, the decision of this question, albeit one of fact, rests with the trial judge.\nLord Sumner dealt with the question asked in the Ibrahim case and construed it, though in form a question, to be, in effect, \"indistinguishable from an exclamation of dismay on the part of a humane officer.\" No misdirection was found and the reception of the statement was affirmed.\nProsko v. The King 8, was an appeal under sec. 1023. This Court, though a question was asked, affirmed the decision of the trial judge that the statement received in evidence was voluntary.\nSankey v. The King 9, was also an appeal under sec. 1023. Five grounds of appeal, based upon the dissenting opinion of the Appellate Court, were considered in argument. Under one of these it was contended that the statement given to the police by the accused was not voluntarily made and was improperly received at the trial. The appeal was in fact disposed of and a new trial granted upon one of the other grounds, but Chief Justice Anglin, in delivering the judgment of the Court, continued at p. 440:\nWe feel, however, that we should not part from this case without expressing our view that the proof of the voluntary character of the accused's statement to the police, which was put in evidence against him, is most unsatisfactory.\u2026 With all the facts before him, the learned judge should form his own opinion that the tendered statement was indeed free and voluntary as the basis for its admission, rather than accept the mere opinion of the police officer, who had obtained it, that it was made \"voluntarily and freely.\"\nIn Gach v. The King 10, also an appeal under sec. 1023, the magistrate had received the admission in evidence and this was affirmed by a majority of the Appellate Court in Manitoba. In this Court it was held that the evidence did not affirmatively prove the statement was voluntary. Mr. Justice Kerwin, with whom the Chief Justice agreed, was of the opinion that a threat had been made and that the evidence did not affirmatively prove that the statement had been made before the words constituting the threat, while the majority stressed, in the particular circumstances, the absence of any caution or warning.\nIn Boudreau v. The King 11, again an appeal under sec. 1023, the majority of this Court were of the opinion that the learned trial judge had not misdirected himself, as suggested by the dissenting opinion in the Appellate Court of Quebec, and, therefore, affirmed his reception of the statements as voluntarily made.\nIn The King v. Bellos 12, the Appellate Court held the statements of the accused, following questions by the police, had been improperly received in evidence at the trial. Leave to appeal was granted under sec. 1024(2) (later 1025). This Court reversed the Appellate Court, holding that the Crown had discharged its burden of establishing the voluntary character of the statements made by the accused. Chief Justice Anglin, speaking for the Court, stated at p. 261:\nThe mere asking of a question by the officer subsequently, or his directing the accused's attention to the subject of one of such statements, did not amount to an inducement or persuasion such as would render the statements inadmissible.\nIn Thiffault v. The King 13, special leave to appeal was obtained under sec. 1025 of the Criminal Code. The Appellate Court in Quebec had held that the decision upon the admissibility of a statement taken from an accused party in answer to questions was a matter of discretion for the trial judge. This Court held that it was not a matter of discretion and, following the Sankey case supra, held that the evidence did not establish the statement had been voluntarily made.\nIn the foregoing cases, the failure of the trial judge to direct himself as to the burden that rests upon the Crown and its duty to call all available witnesses who were present at the making of the confession, as in The Queen v. Thompson, Sankey v. The King and Thiffault v. The King, constitutes a misdirection in law. Also, when the trial judge has directed himself that the absence of caution or warning, as in Gach v. The King, or the mere asking of questions, as in Bellos v. The King, of necessity excludes the statement, he has misdirected himself in law. On the other hand, where there was no misdirection and there was evidence to support the finding of fact, as in Prosko v. The King and Boudreau v. The King, this Court approved the judgment of the trial judge.\nThere is a difference of judicial opinion expressed in the Provincial Courts, but, when examined, the weight of authority supports the view that whether a statement is voluntary or not is a question of fact, or of mixed law and fact.\nThe Crown was first given the right of appeal to the Provincial Appellate Courts in 1930 by an amendment to sec. 1013 (20 & 21 Geo. V., c. 11, sec. 28). In Rex v. Rasmussen 14, the Crown exercised its right to appeal upon a \"question of law alone,\" contending, inter alia, that the trial judge had improperly rejected two written statements or confessions made by the accused. The decision there turned upon the meaning of the reasons given by the trial judge in rejecting the statement. The majority, in construing these reasons, held that the learned trial judge had found the statement to be freely and voluntarily made. In part these reasons read:\n\u2026 I have the feeling that the statement \u2026 was obtained freely and voluntarily, but considering all the surrounding circumstances I don't feel that it convinces me to that degree of certainty which I think the law requires.\nThe trial judge detailed these circumstances and the majority in the Court of Appeal held that the evidence of these circumstances did not justify his rejecting the statement. Baxter J. (later C.J.) stated at p. 240:\n\u2026 the learned trial Judge was in error in thinking that there were rules of law which precluded him from giving effect to the conclusion of fact at which he had arrived, viz., that the statement was made freely and voluntarily.\nBarry C.J.K.B. found a disagreement in his reasons as stated at the trial, and as stated in his certificate under sec. 1020 of the Criminal Code, and would have ordered a new trial on that ground. The construction of the learned trial judge's reasons and whether there was any evidence to justify them and the construction of his certificate all raised questions of law.\nThe same Appellate Court in Rex v. Robichaud 15, in a judgment of the Court written by Baxter C.J., affirmed the admission of a statement made by the accused at the trial. At p. 372 it was stated:\nWhether it was voluntary or not was a question of fact for him (trial judge) and for him alone.\u2026 While agreeing with his action, I would not be at liberty, if I thought otherwise, to overrule it as no principle of law has been violated.\nCounsel for the Crown particularly referred to The King v. Lai Ping 16, where an application for leave to appeal from a conviction, on the basis, inter alia, that the confession of the accused was improperly admitted into evidence, was refused, and where Chief Justice Hunter stated, at p. 471:\n\u2026 whether the trial Judge was right in coming to the conclusion that the confession was voluntary, is a question of law and can be reserved as such.\nHe went on to find that the magistrate was right in admitting the confession and refused leave to appeal. In the same case Duff J. (then a member of the British Columbia Court and later Chief Justice of this Court) stated at p. 473:\n\u2026 if the decision of the preliminary question turned upon conflicting statements of fact made by witnesses, I should have thought it was fairly clear that the correctness of such a decision could not be raised on a question of law. I certainly find some difficulty, myself, in stating a case arising upon such a decision in the form of a question of law.\nThis was a decision to the effect that, as no error in law was found, the conclusion at trial should be affirmed and leave to appeal refused.\nCounsel also referred to Rex v. Baschuk 17. In that case the Appellate Court in Manitoba, in effect, held that the trial judge had misdirected himself in refusing to hear evidence on the part of the accused that the statement was not voluntary. Dennistoun J.A., in delivering the judgment of the Court, stated at p. 209:\nThe admissibility of the statement was \u00e0 question of law and was for the Judge alone. and cited Ibrahim v. The King, supra. The Court in the Baschuk case was clearly dealing with a question of law and, therefore, the statement just quoted must be read in that relation.\nCounsel also cited Rex v. Weighill 18. The Appellate Court in British Columbia affirmed the reception in evidence of a confession. Mr. Justice O'Halloran, with whom Mr. Justice Robertson agreed, stated at p. 563:\nUnder these circumstances the learned Judge, after what is not questioned was a proper \"trial within a trial,\" came to the conclusion that the prosecution had affirmatively proven that the confession was voluntary and admitted it in evidence.\nLater in the same case the learned judge stated, at p. 564:\nThe appeal was framed as one of law only. But upon it being pointed out that, while the admission or rejection of a confession is undoubtedly a question of law, nevertheless, the supporting findings of fact and the legitimate inferences therefrom may be questions of fact or of mixed law and fact.\u2026 Counsel for the appellant moved and was granted leave to appeal against those findings of fact or mixed law and fact.\nThis paragraph illustrates the difficulties involved in this question and, with respect, I think the preferable view is that whether the statement in question is voluntary is a question of fact, or of mixed law and fact, dependent upon a conclusion which involves an appreciation of all the circumstances, including determination of credibility, a weighing of evidence, and construction of oral statements and written documents. The position, as stated by Turgeon J.A., is not unusual:\nThe learned Chief Justice was justified, taking into consideration the numerous warnings the accused had already received and listening to his own evidence and observing him, in concluding that he did not make his statement under a promise or a threat of such a nature as to render his action involuntary.\nRex v. Bahrey 19.\nIn Rex v. McLaren 20, the Appellate Court of Alberta affirmed the reception in evidence of a confession made by the accused on which the case for the prosecution upon a charge of murder largely rested. Harvey C.J.A., writing the judgment of the Court, stated at p. 300:\nThe trial Judge accepted the evidence of the policemen and I can see no ground for questioning the correctness of his finding that the confession was voluntary and therefore admissible. and later, in dealing with a somewhat similar point, he stated at p. 302:\nUnless a confession is voluntary when made to one in authority it is not admissible in evidence and for the purpose of deciding its admissibility the trial Judge must find the fact that it is voluntary \u2026\nThe weight of authority supports the conclusion that when a trial judge finds a confession or statement has been voluntarily made by an accused he is not determining a question of law, but rather a question of fact, or a mixed question of law and fact. The appeal to this Court under sec. 1023 being restricted to a question of law upon which there has been a dissent in the Court below, it follows that no appeal can be taken to this Court under that section unless the dissent in the Appellate Court is upon a question of law in respect of which the learned trial judge, in arriving at his conclusion, has misdirected himself.\nThe appeal on behalf of the Crown in this case raises two questions of law: (a) was the learned trial judge in error in construing the words \"that there were serious charges likely to arise from her condition, charges against him because of her condition;\" and (b) was he in error in directing himself as to the effect of the questions asked in the course of the making of the statement?\nThe evidence in this case, upon the trial within a trial, was confined to that given by the policemen. It was all to the same effect and the statement would have been admitted as voluntary by the learned trial judge had he not construed the words spoken by constable Thompson \"that there were serious charges likely to arise from her condition, charges against him because of her condition\" as constituting an inducement or a threat. However these words might under other circumstances be construed, with respect, I cannot, in the circumstances here present, attribute such a meaning. The policemen and the accused were at least well acquainted and, while performing their duty in making the investigation, with commendable care they informed the accused of his position. When the words of Constable Thompson above quoted are read, as they must be, in association with the information which preceded and the warning which followed, it is clear that they did but plainly indicate to the appellant that criminal proceedings might be taken against him. That he so understood what had been said to him is evident from his subsequent conduct, including his remarks. In the circumstances I do not think that these words did other than inform the accused of his position and did not constitute an inducement or a threat.\nThe learned judge also felt disposed to find the statement not voluntary because it was elicited by the asking of questions. It is the duty of the police to investigate and, so far as possible, to ascertain who has and in what manner they have violated the criminal law. In the course of their investigations it is necessary to ask questions, but, once it has been determined to take criminal proceedings against a party, that party should be advised of his position and appropriately warned. This is not a positive rule or requirement of law, but it is a wise precaution, as all statements made by an accused after his actual or virtual custody must be affirmatively proved to have been voluntarily made. If, thereafter, questions are asked, the nature and character of the questions are but additional facts to be taken into account in determining whether or not the statements have been made voluntarily. The mere fact that questions are asked does not of necessity exclude the confession or statement. Sir Lyman Duff, delivering the judgment of this Court, stated at p. 515:\nIt results from this statement of the law that the determination of any question raised as to the voluntary character of a statement by the accused elicited by interrogatories administered by the police is not a mere matter of discretion for the trial judge, as the court below appears to have thought.\nThiffault v. The King 21; Rex v. Best 22; Rex v. Bahrey 23; Rex v. Hanna 24.\nIn this case the learned trial judge did not read the statement over and, therefore, was not in a position to pass upon the nature and character of the questions as asked. In view of the issues raised and the evidence given, the questions having been set out in the statement, the reading thereof was indispensable to an adequate appreciation of their possible effect. It may be that the questions did not in any way constitute an inducement or a threat, as in The King v. Bellos 25, where Chief Justice Anglin, speaking for the Court, stated:\nThe mere asking of a question by the officer subsequently, or his directing the accused's attention to the subject of one of such statements, did not amount to an inducement or persuasion such as would render the statements inadmissible.\nIn these circumstances I am of the opinion that the learned trial judge misdirected himself as to the effect of the words of Constable Thompson and that, therefore, a new trial should be had. The learned trial judge also misdirected himself if his view was that the mere asking of questions precluded a finding that the statement was voluntarily made. This issue in this case must be determined at the new trial by a reading of the statement in relation to the other relevant evidence.\nThe appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.\nCartwright J.\u2014The relevant portions of the evidence and of the reasons of the learned trial judge for refusing to admit the statement of the accused are set out in the reasons for judgment of my brother Estey.\nI am unable to find that the learned trial judge misdirected himself on any point of law. There is nothing in the record to suggest that he was unmindful of the well settled rule that the statement of the appellant should not be admitted in evidence against him unless it were shewn by the prosecution to have been voluntary in the sense that it was not obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage induced by a person in authority. It appears to me that the learned trial judge, on a consideration of the evidence as to all the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement, was not satisfied that the burden resting upon the Crown had been discharged.\nIt is not, I think, shewn that the learned trial judge directed himself that he must, as a matter of law, exclude the statement because prior to its making one of the officers had said to the appellant:\u2014\n\"Well, she is in the hospital and she is in serious condition,\" and that there were serious charges likely to arise from her condition, charges against him because of her condition. nor does it appear to me that the learned trial judge directed himself, as a matter of law, that the statement must be excluded because it was made as a result of questions put to the accused by the police officers. I think he treated both of these circumstances as matters to be weighed with the rest of the evidence in reaching his final conclusion. The majority of the Court of Appeal have concurred in the view of the learned trial judge and I find myself quite unable to say that they were wrong. It is not relevant to inquire whether I would necessarily have reached the same conclusion in the first instance.\nHaving formed the opinion that no error on the part of the learned trial judge has been shewn, I do not find it necessary to consider the question, so ably debated before us, whether the alleged errors, if established, could have been said to involve questions of law alone.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.

Mossop, [1951] S.C.R. 815\nDate: 1951-06-20\nHarold Hannen Gilmour (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nMarion L. Mossop (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1951: May 16, 17; 1951: June 20.\nPresent: Kerwin, Rand, Estey, Locke and Cartwright JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nMaster and Servant\u2014Negligence\u2014Safety of premises\u2014Housekeeper tripped over dog on stairway\u2014Duty of employer.\nThe respondent had been employed for a month as housekeeper in appellant's bungalow when, on her way to the basement, she fell to the bottom of the stairway after stepping on a dog belonging to appellant and which was lying on the top step of the basement stairway. Appellant owned two dogs who, when indoors, were either in the basement or in the house itself. Respondent, informed by appellant's daughter that the dogs were fond of lying on the top step of the basement stairs, never complained about that. Appellant who was aware of this habit of the dogs did not warn respondent of any possible danger and was unaware that his daughter had done so.The trial judge and the majority in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia maintained the action.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from and dismissing the action, that the claims that the lighting of the stairs was inadequate and that appellant knowingly permitted the dog to occupy the stairway were not borne out by the evidence; the appellant, as was his duty, provided premises that were reasonably safe for the carrying on of the work for which the respondent as housekeeper was employed and there was no evidence of any actionable negligence on his part.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , affirming, Smith J.A. dissenting, the maintenance of the plaintiff's action.\nJ. W. de B. Farris K.C. for the appellant.\nH. L. Harkley for the respondent.\nKERWIN J.:\u2014The duty of an employer is to supply and install proper equipment for his employee's work and a proper system of work so far as care and skill can secure these results: Marshment v. Borgstrom[2] . He is also, of course, liable for any personal negligence. These rules are applicable to household work. The circumstances in the present case appear elsewhere and I am unable to find in them that the appellant failed in his duty in any respect.\nApparently the stairway was well constructed and there was no necessity of having any railing. The claim that the appellant knowingly permitted the dogs to be on the stairway is not borne out by the evidence because, as Mr. Justice Sidney Smith (1) points out, when the appellant found either of his two dogs on the stairway he \"kicked them off.\" The respondent had been warned by the appellant's daughter that the dogs liked to sleep on the stairs and she knew of this propensity.\nOn the last point, I am of opinion that the stairs were properly lighted. If they could have been better illuminated by the ceiling light in the kitchen nearest the stairs, that was something that could, and should have been done by the respondent. On the evidence she was not forbidden to use this light but merely directed to turn out all unnecessary lights. In view of the respondent's position in the household and her knowledge of the habits of the dogs, I can come to no conclusion other than that the occurrence was an unfortunate accident.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Rand and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[3] dismissing the appeal of the present appellant from a judgment for damages, for personal injuries sustained by the respondent during the course of her employment as a housekeeper in the appellant's home in Vancouver. Sidney Smith, J.A. dissented and would have allowed the appeal and dismissed the action.\nThe facts, in so far as they appear to me to be relevant, are as follows:\u2014The respondent entered the service of the defendant on December 1, 1948, her duties, as described by her, being those of housekeeper which included cooking, washing and keeping the house generally in order. The appellant's home is a bungalow with a stairway leading from the basement into the kitchen. At the time of the commencement of the employment and throughout its duration the appellant owned two small dogs, one a black Scotch terrier and one referred to by the respondent as a white Highland terrier. These animals were apparently house dogs who spent their time when indoors either in the house itself or in the basement. According to the respondent, the appellant's married daughter lived in the house during the first two weeks of the employment, apparently with the view of explaining the respondent's duties to her, and during this period informed her that the dogs were \"rather fond of lying on the basement stairs\" and said further that they had \"quite a habit of staying on the top step of the basement stairs\" and pointed out that this was dangerous. The respondent admitted that she knew that the dogs slept on the top step occasionally. She apparently was fond of the dogs and allowed them, at least at times, to sleep in the kitchen while she was doing her work: the weather had been cold around Christmas and she said that the black dog was usually lying under the kitchen range and the white dog in front of the kitchen register. About the middle of December the appellant's daughter left, leaving the respondent in charge of the housework. It is clear that during this period she frequently went to the basement in carrying on her duties. The stairway was carpeted with a dark coloured carpet and was some nine steps in length, and from the ceiling at the bottom there was suspended a light which could be turned on by a switch located on the wall immediately to the right of the entrance to the stairway. In addition to this, the doorway led directly from the stairway into the kitchen and there were two lights in the ceiling in this room, one at least of which when turned on would materially improve the lighting at the head of the stairs. There was no handrail on either side of the stairway.\nOn the evening of the accident when the appellant, his son and the respondent had sat down to dinner, the latter discovered that she had forgotten some food and got up from the table to proceed to the basement to procure it. According to her evidence she had turned out one of the lights in the kitchen, in accordance with general instructions received by her from the appellant to turn off the lights when the room was not in use. On approaching the entrance to the stairway she switched on the basement light and then stepped on the black dog, which was apparently lying on the top step, falling down the stairs and sustaining injuries. This dog, she said, had been lying under the kitchen range all that afternoon and had attempted to follow her into the dining room, presumably when she went in to dinner. She had ordered him back and she concluded that he had gone back to sleep under the stove where it was warm. She said that when she had last seen him he was sitting at the dining room door trying to get in.\nThere is really no dispute between the parties as to these habits of the dogs. The appellant was aware that they slept on the basement stairs at times and said that \"we all knew it.\" The black dog, he said, would very often lie on the top step looking into the kitchen through the open doorway. There was no complaint made to him by the respondent and he did not warn her of any possible danger and was unaware that his daughter had done so. The plaintiff's claim is founded in negligence and the particulars pleaded are:\u2014\n(a) The stairway was unlighted and very dark and there was no lighting or means of lighting provided.\n(b) There was no handrail.\n(c) The defendant knowingly permitted his dog to occupy the stairway without providing adequate lighting for the protection of those using the stairway.\nCoady, J. by whom the action was tried, found as a fact that the respondent had been advised when she came to work that the dogs were in the habit of lying on the stairway and, while she had not observed them lying there at any time before the accident, she knew that they were from time to time to be found there. Considering, however, that the defendant knew that the dogs were from time to time to be found lying there and that he knew or ought to have known the danger which this would create for anyone using the stairway, unless \"precaution was observed to determine before stepping on the stairway that the dog was not there\", he found there was a breach of duty unless the doctrine volenti non fit injuria applied or the employee was guilty of contributory negligence. The learned judge was not satisfied that the respondent had freely and voluntarily, with full knowledge of the nature and extent of the risk she ran, impliedly agreed to incur it: as to contributory negligence he considered there was none. While finding that had the respondent hesitated at the top of the stairway when she put the light on and peered down at the first step the lighting was sufficient to enable her to see the dog there, he did not think this was a failure on her part to exercise reasonable care for her own safety. On the appeal O'Halloran, J.A., considering that the trial judge had neither misapprehended the evidence or erred in the application of appropriate legal principles, held that the appeal failed. Robertson, J.A. agreed with the learned trial judge that there was no contributory negligence and no volens. Finding that the appellant had never warned the respondent of any danger while knowing that her duties required her to go several times a day to the basement, he considered that the appellant was under a duty to take steps to guard against the danger she ran of stepping on the dog and falling. The fact that the respondent was well aware that the dogs at times lay on the steps and had been warned of the danger by the appellant's daughter is not noted.\nWhile neither the judgment at the trial nor the reasons of the majority of the Court of Appeal appear to support the verdict on any of the three grounds of negligence pleaded, the matter should not, I think, be disposed of on this footing. The absence of the handrail does not appear to have been considered as affecting the matter by any of the learned judges who have considered the case. As to the lighting, the learned trial judge, as stated, found that it was sufficient to disclose the presence of the dog, had the plaintiff looked before starting down the stairway. There was no evidence to support the contention that the appellant knowingly permitted the dog to occupy the stairway and that he was aware of the dog's presence there. The respondent's case must, therefore, rest upon the ground that in the circumstances disclosed the appellant owed a duty to her to guard her in some manner against such risk as was inherent in the fact that the dogs were permitted to be in the house and at times on the basement stairs, with the risk of falling to which this might subject the respondent.\nIn my opinion, the judgment appealed from cannot be sustained. I agree with Mr. Justice Sidney Smith that the evidence does not disclose a cause of action. An employer who has a housekeeper or domestic servant is bound at common law to provide premises that are reasonably safe for the carrying on of the work for which the employee is engaged. As in the case of other employers he must not expose his servant to unreasonable risks. With great respect for the opinion of the learned trial judge, I think the principle upon which such cases as Baker v. James[4], where the liability sought to be established was on the ground that the employer had supplied the injured employee with a defective motor car, has no application to the present matter. Smith v. Baker[5] and Wilsons and Clyde Coal Company v. English[6] , are the leading cases in which liability was sought to be established on the basis that there was some defective system of work or defective machinery and plant. There was nothing of this nature in the present case unless, indeed, the system of lighting was insufficient and I think the evidence does not support any such view. It cannot be contended on the evidence that the appellant's house was other than a reasonably safe place to carry on the duties with which the respondent was charged. The stairway to the basement was that usually found in houses of this nature and afforded a proper and safe means of access to the basement to any person exercising ordinary care. The common law infers that when a person enters into a contract of service he takes on himself the ordinary risks incident to such work as is lawfully carried on upon the master's premises. It is common place to find in private houses in Canada where housekeepers or servants are employed small house pets such as dogs and cats. The habits of these small animals of sleeping on the floor in various places throughout dwellings and as well upon stairways is a matter of common knowledge and, in my opinion, it is an implied term of such contracts of employment that any slight risk that this may involve is assumed by the employee. I regard that as being in the same category as other risks ordinarily involved in doing housework, the assumption of which I consider also to be implied. If such risk was increased by a failure to supply proper lighting, other considerations would arise but here it is plain from the evidence that the light available to the respondent from the basement light provided was adequate to enable her to see the dog: if further light had been required it was available from the overhead light in the kitchen, which she failed to turn on. To hold that in these circumstances the appellant is liable is, in my opinion, to make him an insurer of the safety of his servant.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nESTEY J.:\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed. The defendant is entitled to his costs throughout. CARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014There does not appear to be any dispute as to the relevant facts in this case. Such facts are fully set out in the judgment of my brother Locke.\nIn my view there is no evidence that the injuries suffered by the plaintiff were caused or contributed to by the breach of any duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff.I think that her injuries were the result of an unfortunate accident.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L.

La Cour d'Appel 2 a infirm\u00e9 ce jugement, et le dispositif de l'ordonnance de cette Cour se lit ainsi:\nPar ces motifs,\nAccueille l'appel avec d\u00e9pens; infirme le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure; et, faisant droit avec d\u00e9pens \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l'appelante, reconna\u00eet l'\u00e9crit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par la requ\u00e9rante pour v\u00e9rification, savoir: la lettre qu'Eug\u00e8ne Berthiaume lui a adress\u00e9e le 21 ao\u00fbt 1946, comme le v\u00e9ritable et dernier testament dudit Eug\u00e8ne Berthiaume et en ordonne l'homologation avec toutes les cons\u00e9quences que de droit; annule le jugement rendu par le d\u00e9put\u00e9-protonotaire de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure du District de Montr\u00e9al le 4 septembre 1946, par lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu et v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 un testament fait par ledit Eug\u00e8ne Berthiaume, le 14 mars 1935; et ordonne au protonotaire de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure du District de Montr\u00e9al, mis en cause, de noter en marge des registres qui sont sous sa garde et o\u00f9 appara\u00eet la v\u00e9rification dudit testament du 14 mars 1935, le pr\u00e9sent jugement, \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit.\nLors de l'argument, une question de juridiction soulev\u00e9e par le banc, s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Certains membres de la cour ont en effet \u00e9mis des doutes sur les pouvoirs de cette cour d'entendre un appel sur un jugement en v\u00e9rification de testament. En vertu de la Loi de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, pour que la cour ait juridiction, il faut n\u00e9cessairement qu'il s'agisse d'un jugement final, qui d\u00e9termine en tout ou en partie un droit absolu de l'une des parties.\nL'effet d'un jugement de v\u00e9rification n'est pas uniquement d'autoriser qu'il soit d\u00e9livr\u00e9 des copies certifi\u00e9es du testament, lesquelles copies ont un caract\u00e8re d'authenticit\u00e9. (C.C. 857.) Ce jugement de v\u00e9rification \u00e9tablit que le testament est prima facie valide, et comme le disent les Commissaires charg\u00e9s de la codification (5\u00e8me Rapport, 178) : \"Il y a int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 ce que la validit\u00e9 subisse une premi\u00e8re \u00e9preuve\". Ce jugement donne effet au testament jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il soit infirm\u00e9 sur contestation. (C.C. 857); jusqu'\u00e0 l\u00e0, il constitue une \"preuve provisoire\". (Mignault v. Malo 3; Wynne v. Wynne 4; Amiot v. Dugas 5; Billette v. Vall\u00e9e 6; Latour v. Grenier 7; Mignault, Vol. 4, 313; Langelier, Vol. 3, 139). De plus, les h\u00e9ritiers appel\u00e9s \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification peuvent ensuite contester le testament. (858 C.C.)\nIl s'ensuivrait que le jugement rendu par la Cour d'Appel n'est pas d\u00e9finitif, en ce sens qu'il n'a pas d\u00e9termin\u00e9 finalement les droits des parties. Nous n'avons pas eu cependant le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d'un argument complet sur ce point, car aucune des parties n'a \u00e9mis de doute sur notre juridiction. On a sembl\u00e9 plut\u00f4t prendre pour acquis que cette Cour \u00e9tait l\u00e9galement saisie de la cause.\nSi j'en venais \u00e0 la conclusion que cet appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu, il faudrait d\u00e9terminer au pr\u00e9alable cette question de juridiction, mais comme je crois qu'il doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 au m\u00e9rite, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de l'examiner davantage.\nJe m'accorde avec le jugement de la Cour d'Appel qui a ordonn\u00e9 la v\u00e9rification. Cette cour qui avait \u00e9videmment juridiction pour entendre la cause en vertu des dispositions de l'article 44 C.P., ne s'est pas tant bas\u00e9e, pour rendre son jugement, sur la preuve volumineuse produite par l'appelant concernant les motifs qui ont pu inspirer le de cujus Eug\u00e8ne Berthiaume, \u00e0 \u00e9crire cette lettre du 21 ao\u00fbt 1946, que sur l'analyse et l'examen du document lui-m\u00eame, c'est-\u00e0-dire sur la question de savoir s'il constitue ou non un testament au sens de la loi. La Cour d'Appel a en effet exprim\u00e9 des doutes sur son droit d'aller rechercher ailleurs que dans l'\u00e9crit, les raisons pour lesquelles la v\u00e9rification doit \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9e. Ceci me para\u00eet conforme au jugement rendu par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e de Mignault v. Malo, o\u00f9 l'on trouve ce qui suit:\nIt is very doubtful whether any allegation or plea as to the merits, for instance, a plea or allegation setting up insanity or undue influence could be propounded, or would be admitted on an application for probate.\nA tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, la Cour a exprim\u00e9 l'opinion que je partage, que m\u00eame s'il y avait lieu de tenir compte de toutes les circonstances extrins\u00e8ques, il n'y a rien dans la preuve qui permette de conclure que Berthiaume n'a pas eu l'intention de tester en faveur de l'intim\u00e9e.\nIl reste donc \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si cet \u00e9crit constitue bien un testament au sens de la loi. Il y a longtemps qu'il ne fait plus de doute qu'une lettre missive peut constituer un testament olographe valide, qui comme on le sait, n'a pas besoin d'\u00eatre entour\u00e9 de formules sacramentelles. Du moment qu'un document est \u00e9crit en entier de la main du testateur, qu'il est sign\u00e9 par lui, qu'il contient une disposition de biens \u00e0 l'exclusion de simples recommandations, qu'il r\u00e9v\u00e8le chez son auteur une volont\u00e9 de tester, et qu'il n'est pas seulement un projet, alors, il est v\u00e9ritablement un testament.\nLa lettre du 21 ao\u00fbt 1946 r\u00e9ncontre-t-elle ces conditions? Il est admis qu'elle est \u00e9crite en entier et sign\u00e9e par le testateur, mais c'est la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant qu'elle ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas une intention de l\u00e9guer, mais plut\u00f4t une promesse de compl\u00e9ter un autre testament d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9 et fait suivant la loi anglaise. De plus, l'emploi du conditionnel \"j'aimerais \u00e0 te dire\" cr\u00e9erait suffisamment d'\u00e9quivoque et d'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 pour sous-entendre de la part de Berthiaume des conditions et des r\u00e9serves qui emp\u00eacheraient cette lettre d'\u00eatre une disposition \u00e0 cause de mort.\nJe ne puis admettre ces pr\u00e9tentions. Tout d'abord, la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un testament ant\u00e9rieur et incomplet que la fatigue ou la maladie l'aurait emp\u00each\u00e9 de terminer, indique bien de la part de Berthiaume l'intention de tester en faveur de l'intim\u00e9e. Le but de cette lettre est \u00e9videmment d'assurer l'intim\u00e9e que de \"toutes fa\u00e7ons\", c'est-\u00e0-dire que le de cujus ait ou non le temps de compl\u00e9ter son testament ant\u00e9rieur, elle sera son h\u00e9riti\u00e8re. Il veut lui dire que si dans l'intervalle \"il lui arrivait quelque chose\", c'est-\u00e0-dire \"dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 de sa mort\", \"tout ce qui lui appartient\" est \u00e0 elle. Tous ces mots font clairement de l'intim\u00e9e une l\u00e9gataire universelle. Je ne puis voir aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9, aucune r\u00e9serve, aucun indice qu'il ne s'agirait que d'un projet de tester. Il y a l\u00e0, \u00e0 mon sens, une compl\u00e8te disposition testamentaire.\nL'emploi du conditionnel \"j'aimerais \u00e0 te dire\" n'affecte en rien la valeur l\u00e9gale du testament. Ces mots signifient \"je tiens \u00e0 te dire\". On sait que le conditionnel est souvent employ\u00e9 pour exprimer autre chose qu'une condition. Il remplace souvent l'indicatif pour rendre une m\u00eame id\u00e9e. Il sert \u00e0 exprimer un souhait, ou bien encore une affirmation adoucie. Ainsi, \"je voudrais vous parler\" a le m\u00eame sens que \"je veux vous parler\". \"Je serais heureux de vous voir\" marque \u00e9videmment un d\u00e9sir et n'implique aucune condition. Aux pr\u00e9sentes proc\u00e9dures est intervenue Fanny Ir\u00e8ne Colin, \u00e9pouse d'Eug\u00e8ne Berthiaume. Elle soumet que ledit I Berthiaume a sign\u00e9 un testament olographe le 1er novembre 1937, en vertu duquel elle serait l\u00e9gataire universelle, et que le 28 septembre 1943 un autre testament notari\u00e9, re\u00e7u devant L\u00e9onard L\u00e9ger, N.P., serait au m\u00eame effet. Elle admet que ce testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 le 6 avril 1946, mais soutient que si la lettre du 21 ao\u00fbt 1946 n'est pas le dernier testament d'Eug\u00e8ne Berthiaume, elle serait l'h\u00e9riti\u00e8re en vertu du testament du 1er novembre 1937, ou dans l'alternative de la moiti\u00e9 de la succession en vertu de l'article 624b du Code Civil. Comme je crois avec la Cour d'Appel, que cette lettre du 21 ao\u00fbt 1946 est le dernier testament d'Eug\u00e8ne Berthiaume, il s'ensuit que les pr\u00e9tentions de l'intervenante ne peuvent \u00eatre accueillies.\nJe suis d'opinion que le pr\u00e9sent appel et l'intervention doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s avec d\u00e9pens.\nThe judgment of Rand and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014In this appeal there are two questions, one, whether the letter written by the deceased interpreted in the background of the circumstances, can be found to be his will, and the other, whether that issue can be adjudicated in the proceedings before us.\nThese latter originated in a petition which, among other things, prayed for the probate of the document. In Quebec, the articles of the Code dealing with probate provide for a preliminary verification of a testament, that is to say, it is presented to a prothonotary or a judge of the Superior Court, whose function it is to satisfy himself that provisionally, at least, the document ought to be admitted to registration. But by art. 858 \"The probate of a will does not prevent its contestation by persons interested.\" That means, in my opinion, any manner of contestation, and it would be raised in an action or other appropriate proceeding. The jurisdiction is essentially non-contentious. As it appears in Dugas v. Amiot 8:\nEt l'on peut dire que la juridiction exerc\u00e9e en ces mati\u00e8res est plut\u00f4t \"gracieuse ou non contentieuse\" que judiciaire. (Migneault, Droit civil canadien, vol. 4, p. 314). In Migneault v. Malo 9, an unsigned document had been presented to a judge of the Superior Court for probate, and its verification was contested on the ground that by the law of Quebec the document could not be admitted as a testamentary instrument. Witnesses were heard, examined and cross-examined, judgment was rendered as in an ordinary juridical issue, and probate granted. Thereafter an action was taken based upon the will and the same parties again raised the issue of validity. This action took its usual course from the Superior Court to the courts of appeal in the province and ultimately to the Judicial Committee. In the latter the provisions of the statute of 1801 were carefully examined, and the view of the Committee was that on their proper construction the proceedings in probate were intended to be assimilated to probate in England and that a contestation made and determined established res judicata of the issues involved. On the other hand, for a period of over seventy years, another interpretation had been given them to the effect that the probate determined no legal rights. In view of that practice, the Committee held the decision on the issue raised and contested before the judge in probate not to be a final determination and that the contestation was open to the defendant in the latter proceedings.\nThe point involved, as I have said, was one of law, whether an unsigned document could constitute in 1866, before the Code, a will. The Code deals with the matter in a number of articles, but I do not construe them as changing nor do I understand that any construction has been suggested which changes the nature of the proceedings or jurisdiction from what they bore earlier. In Migneault's language, it is \"gracieuse ou non contentieuse\", and it must be taken not to go to the judicial determination of substantive rights.\nIn Malo, Sir Robert Phillimore observed that in the seventy years' experience to which he referred no case of appeal in probate had ever been taken. Here, however, an appeal has been taken, and the issues that were fought out before the Superior Court were likewise debated on appeal. On the law established in that case, those contentions were beyond the jurisdiction of the Superior Court and conse- quently of the Court of King's Bench. The appeal was obviously from a decision on matter on which the judge below could adjudicate, but since that was not an adjudication in a determinative judicial sense, the court in appeal could not add to it any jurisdictional virtue of its own.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, I have considered the substantive question of fact, and I agree with the Court of Appeal 10 that the deceased did intend the letter to constitute an interim disposition of his property, that he intended it to be his will until such time as a more formal instrument could, as he contemplated, be made. It was not merely an expression of intention to make the disposition subsequently, nor was it a simulated will held out as an inducement to keep the young lady in a favourable attitude towards him in his difficulties. In coming to this conclusion, I have, of course, taken into account all the relevant circumstances.\nNevertheless, being bound by the decision in Malo to hold the Superior Court and the Court of King's Bench in appeal to have been without jurisdiction to adjudicate substantive rights of the parties, I must hold there is no jurisdiction in this Court to hear the appeal. On that ground, it should be quashed and the respondents given costs as of a motion to that effect. The intervention of Fanny Ir\u00e8ne Colin, widow of the deceased, should be dismissed without costs.\nAppeal and intervention dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the Appellant: Edouard Masson.\nSolicitors for the Respondent: Montgomery, McMichael, Common, Howard, Forsyth & Ker.\nSolicitors for the Intervenant: Charbonneau, Charbonneau & Charlebois.\n1 Q.R.

Lewis, [1951] S.C.R. 830\nDate: 1951-10-02\nDavid Cook (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nRobert (Plaintiff) Respondent.\nPresent: Rand, Estey, Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nNegligence\u2014Hunting accident\u2014Jury's finding that plaintiff shot by one of two defendants but unable to say by which one\u2014Whether finding of absence of negligence was perverse\u2014Onus.\nThe respondent while hunting was shot in the face by bird-shot. The appellant and a member of his party of three hunters admitted discharging their guns in the vicinity practically at the same time but not at the same bird. Appellant's party had agreed to divide the bag evenly. The jury found that the respondent had been shot by one of these two hunters but were unable to say by which one. They also found that the injuries were not caused by the negligence of either. The action was dismissed by the trial judge but the Court of Appeal for British Columbia ordered a new trial.\nHeld (affirming the judgment appealed from) (Locke J. dissenting), that the finding of the jury exculpating both defendants from negligence was rightly set aside.\nPer Rand J.: The jury should have been instructed that if the victim, having brought guilt down to one or both of two persons, could bring home to either or both of them the further wrong of having impaired his remedial right of establishing liability, then the legal consequence would be that the onus would be shifted to the wrong-doer to exculpate himself.\nPer Estey, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: The proper verdict would have been reached had the jury been instructed that once the plaintiff had proven that he was shot by one of the defendants the onus was then on such defendant to establish absence of both intention and negligence; and that if the jury found themselves unable to decide which of the two shot the plaintiff, because in. their opinion both shot negligently in his direction, both defendants should be found liable.\nPer Locke J. (dissenting): Since neither of the defendants was liable for the negligence of the other, in the absence of a finding as to which of them had shot the plaintiff, the action was properly dismissed. Since the answers declared the inability of the jury to say which of the defendants had fired the shot which caused the injury, no question arose as to whether the finding that neither of the defendants had been negligent was perverse.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] setting aside the dismissal of the action by the trial judge and ordering a new trial. G. N. Shaver K.C. and F. S. Cunliffe K.C. for the appellant.\nA. Leighton and W. G. Burke-Robertson for the respondent.\nRAND J.:\u2014I agree with the Court of Appeal[2] that the finding of the jury exculpating both defendants from negligence was perverse and it is unnecessary to examine the facts on which that conclusion is based.\nThere remains the answer that, although shots from one of the two guns struck the respondent, the jury could not determine from which they came. This is open to at least four interpretations: first, believing that only one discharge could have inflicted the injuries, they found it difficult to decide which testimony, whether that of Cook or Aikenhead, was to. be accepted, the evidence of each, taken at its face, excluding guilt; or that the shots from both guns having been fired so nearly at the same time and to have been aimed so nearly at the same target, it was impossible for them to say which struck the eye: or that they were unable to say whether the situation was either of those two alternatives: or finally, that they were not unanimous on any one or more of these views.\nIt will be seen that there is one feature common to the first three: having found that either A or B had been the cause of injury to C, the jury declare that C has not satisfied them which of the two it was. It is then a prob\u00adlem in proof and must be considered from that standpoint.\nA cause may be said to be an operating element which in de facto co-operation with what may be called environment is considered the factor of culpability in determining legal responsibility for damage or loss done to person or property. But in that determination the practical diffi\u00adculty turns on the allocation of elements to the one or other of these two divisions of data. In considering the second and third possibilities in this case, the essential obstacle to proof is the fact of multiple discharges so related as to confuse their individual effects: it is that fact that bars final proof. But if the victim, having brought guilt down to one or both of two persons before the court, can bring home to either of them a further wrong done him in relation to his remedial right of making that proof, then I should say that on accepted principles, the barrier to it can and should be removed.\nThe Court of Appeal of England has laid down this principle: that if A is guilty of a negligent act toward B, the total direct consequences of that act are chargeable against A notwithstanding that they arise from reactions unforeseeable by the ordinary person acting reasonably; Polemis v. Furness Withy[3]. In that case, the presence of benzine was known, but that a spark could occur in the fall of a plank into the hold sufficient to set off an explosion, although a potentiality of the total circum\u00adstances, was outside the range of anticipation; a falling plank might do some damage to the ship, but would not ordinarily be associated in the impact on wood or iron with fire, and, a fortiori, with sparking explosive fumes.\nSimilarly would that result follow where, instead of an unforeseen potentiality, an element is introduced into the scene at the critical moment of which or its probability the negligent actor knows or ought to have known. That element becomes, then, one of the circumstances in re-action with which the consequences of his act manifest themselves, among which, here, is the confusion of con-sequences. If the new element is innocent, no liability results to the person who introduces it; if culpable, its effect in law remains to be ascertained.\nWhat, then, the culpable actor has done by his initial negligent act is, first, to have set in motion a dangerous force which embraces the injured person within the scope of its probable mischief; and next, in conjunction with circumstances which he must be held to contemplate, to have made more difficult if not impossible the means of proving the possible damaging results of his own act or the similar results of the act of another. He has violated not only the victim's substantive right to security, but he has also culpably impaired the latter's remedial right of estab\u00adlishing liability. By confusing his act with environmental conditions, he has, in effect, destroyed the victim's power of proof. The legal consequence of that is, I should say, that the onus is then shifted to the wrongdoer to exculpate himself; it becomes in fact a question of proof between him and the other and innocent member of the alternatives, the burden of which he must bear. The onus attaches to culpa\u00adbility, and if both acts bear that taint, the onus or prima facie transmission of responsibility attaches to both, and the question of the sole responsibility of one is a matter between them.\nOn the first interpretation, the answer of the jury was insufficient as a return. Their duty was to determine the facts from the evidence laid before them as best they could on the balance of probabilities, and it could not be evaded in the face of such divergent testimony either because of a tender regard for distasteful implications or for any other reason. The jury might have reached a deadlock from which there was no escape: but with the proper direction as to onus, that would have been obviated. The result is that there has been no verdict on an essential question, and the judgment based upon the answer cannot stand.\nAlthough counsel were quite willing that questions be put, it seems evident that they had no part in formulating them; and I cannot but think that to ask \"... are you able to decide by which one\" was unfortunate because it opened to the jury a means of escape from an unpleasant duty, and it implied that it would be proper for them to answer as they did: they ought to have been asked to find from which gun came the shots that did the harm. Even without the direction as to onus, they should have been sent back to endeavour to complete their findings.\nIf, next, the answer means, as it may, that lack of unanimity was the frustrating factor, there is again a fatal incompleteness of findings, because of which, like-wise, the judgment cannot stand.\nThe remaining interpretations fall within the considera\u00adtions already expressed. The dominating fact is a con-fusion of causal factors and consequences resulting in what was, in substance, a small shower of flying shot. In dealing with such a situation, we must keep in mind that the task of the Court is to determine responsibility, not cause, but obviously for that purpose cause as ordinarily conceived is a controlling factor. Ultimately, it is cause in a juridical sense that we are to find. In the judicial process, also, auxiliary mechanisms have been adopted which experience has vindicated, such as, for example, onus, estoppel, presumption. Although the facts here, in their precise form, have not, then, previously been pre\u00adsented to the courts of either this country or England, they are such as to which onus is properly invoked.\nThe risks arising from these sporting activities by in-creased numbers of participants and diminishing oppor\u00adtunity for their safe exercise, as the facts here indicate, require appropriate refinements in foresight. Against the private and public interests at stake, is the privilege of the individual to engage in a sport not inherently objec\u00adtionable. As yet, certainly, the community is not ready to assume the burden of such a mishap. The question is whether a victim is to be told that such a risk, not only in substantive right but in remedy, is one he must assume. When we have reached the point where, as here, shots are considered spent at a distance of between 150 feet and 200 feet and the woods are \"full\" of hunters, a somewhat stringent regard to conduct seems to me to be obvious. It would be a strange commentary on its concern toward personal safety, that the law, although forbidding the victim any other mode of redress, was powerless to accord him any in its own form of relief. I am unable to assent to the view that there is any such helplessness.\nLiability would, a fortiori, be the legal result if the acts of several were intended to be co-operative for a common object or if the act of one was so aided or abetted or induced by the act or conduct of another that it could be said to have had the will and the influence of that other behind it; and in determining that fact, the usual understandings between hunters in relation to the exist\u00adence of conditions that would make shooting in a particular situation dangerous, are relevant.\nAssuming, then, that the jury have found one or both of the defendants here negligent, as on the evidence I think they must have, and at the same time have found that the consequences of the two shots, whether from a confusion in time or in area, cannot be segregated, the onus on the guilty person arises. This is a case where each hunter would know of or expect the shooting by the other and the negligent actor has culpably participated in the proof-destroying fact, the multiple shooting and its consequences. No liability will, in any event attach to an innocent act of shooting, but the culpable actor, as against innocence, must bear the burden of exculpation.\nThese views of the law were not as adequately pre\u00adsented to the jury as I think they should have been.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs. The motion to quash for want of jurisdiction is dismissed with. costs.\nThe judgment of Estey, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.\u2011This is an appeal by David Cook, one of the defendants, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (1) setting aside the judgment pro\u00adnounced at the trial in favour of the defendants and directing a new trial. The other defendant, Akenhead, does not appeal.\nThe evidence is conflicting as to many matters and, as I have reached the conclusion that the order of the Court of Appeal[4] directing a new trial should be upheld, I will make no further reference to the evidence than is necessary to indicate the points at issue.\nOn the 11th of September, 1948, the plaintiff was hunting with his brother John Lewis and one Dennis Fitzgerald in the vicinity of Quinsam Lake on Vancouver Island. It was the opening day of the hunting season for blue grouse and deer and it was said that the country in which they were hunting was full of hunters. The defendants, accompanied by John Wagstaff, then sixteen years of age, were hunting grouse together. They were using a dog which belonged to Akenhead. They had agreed to divide their bag evenly.\nIt is said that Cook, Akenhead and Wagstaff were pro\u00adceeding approximately in line, Cook being on the left, Akenhead in the centre and Wagstaff to the right. The dog, which was some little distance ahead of them, came to a point and at about that moment Fitzgerald, who had come into view on Cook's left, called out a warning and pointed towards a clump of trees which was ahead of Cook and Akenhead and in which at that moment the plaintiff was. Cook heard Fitzgerald's call but did not hear what he said. He thought that Fitzgerald was pointing at the 'dog and was calling attention to the fact that the dog was on point. Akenhead states that he did not hear Fitz\u00adgerald's call. Momentarily after this, a covey of some four or five grouse flew up a short distance in front of the dog. Akenhead says that he fired at the bird which was farthest to the right, leaving the other birds to Cook. Cook says that he fired at a bird straight ahead of him. They appear to have fired almost simultaneously. Immediately after-wards there was a scream from the clump of trees, men\u00adtioned above, and the plaintiff appeared. He had received several shot in his face, one of which caused the loss of an eye. John Lewis accused Cook of having shot his brother. Some discussion followed in which both Cook and Aken\u00adhead asserted that they had not fired in the direction of the trees in which the plaintiff was hit.\nIt was the theory of the plaintiff that either Cook or Akenhead or both of them had shot him and that each was liable even if only one of them had fired the shot which struck him. The theory of the defendant Cook was that he had fired only one shot and had fired in such a direction that it was quite impossible that any shot from his gun could have struck the plaintiff. He also stated that there had been a third shot fired almost simultaneously with those fired by himself and Akenhead and suggested that an unidentified third person had fired the shot which injured the plaintiff. His counsel disclaimed before the jury any suggestion that Akenhead had shot the plaintiff.\nAkenhead's position at the trial was that he had fired to the right, that he could not have shot the plaintiff and that if it was either of them it was Cook and not he who had done so.\nThe action was tried before Wood J. with a special jury. The learned judge directed the jury to bring in a general verdict. Some time after the jury had retired they returned to the court room to ask some questions and following a short discussion between the Court and counsel it was decided to put questions to the jury. The questions put and the jury's answers are as follows:\u2011\n1. Q. Was the Plaintiff shot by either of the Defendants?\nA. Yes.\n2. Q. If so by which one of them? (no answer).\n3. Q. If the Plaintiff was shot by one of the Defendants are you able to decide by which one?\nA. No.\n4. Q. Were the Plaintiff's injuries caused by the negligence of either of the Defendants?\nA. No.\n5. Q. Damages\nSpecial (Nothing filled in).\nGeneral (Nothing filled in).\nThe jury brought in these answers at 6.40 p.m. on a Friday. Counsel for the defendant Cook moved for a dismissal of the action and counsel for the plaintiff sub\u00admitted that the answer negativing negligence was perverse and that the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict. The learned trial judge stated that he would hear argument on a later date and thereupon dismissed the jury.\nAt the opening of the argument on the following Wed\u00adnesday counsel for the plaintiff said:\u2011\nFirst of all I think the jury was dismissed too quickly. I was on my feet intending to argue and to request your lordship to send the jury back, and re-instruct them on certain points I will deal with now, and have them reconsider them in view of certain instructions which I think would have been appropriate in view of the first answer, that is when they found one or other of the defendants fired the shot. That created a condition of affairs that made further instructions proper. Of course we were all tired. It was the end of the day, everybody wanted to get away, and the jury was out before anybody realized what was happening.\nand argued that the trial judge should himself direct a new trial. At the conclusion of the argument the learned trial judge dismissed the action, with costs.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal was delivered by Sidney Smith J.A. He rejected the appellant's argument that Cook and Akenhead were joint tortfeasors and that judgment should be entered against both. He expressed the view that the jury should not have had much trouble in deciding which of the two defendants was the guilty party and continued,\u2011\nHowever, having held (rightly as I think) that one of the defendants shot the plaintiff, the jury acted perversely in finding that neither was negligent, and I think the plaintiff is entitled to a new trial. McConnell v. McLean (1937) S.C.R. 341, followed in B.C. Electric v. Protopappas (1946) 4 D.L.R. 1. I have given thought to the question whether we should try to narrow the issues on the new trial; but I have concluded that it is impracticable to do so, and that we should order a new trial simpliciter; the appellant to have his costs of this appeal, the costs of the first trial to follow the result of the second.\nFrom this judgment the defendant Cook appeals to this Court. Notice of his appeal was served upon Akenhead but Akenhead does not, appeal.\nCounsel for the appellant before us did not attack the first answer of the jury, that the plaintiff was shot by either Cook or Akenhead. He submitted that the answer to Question 3 was a finding that the Plaintiff had not satisfied the onus of proving that Cook shot him and that on the evidence a jury acting reasonably might properly so find, that there was evidence on which the jury might properly find, ,as they did in answer to Question 4, that the plaintiff's injuries were not caused by the negligence of either of the defendants and that either of such findings was sufficient to support the judgment dismissing the action.\nCounsel for the respondent contended that under the circumstances disclosed in the evidence Cook and Akenhead should both have been found liable regardless of which of them fired the shot which struck the plaintiff, that the Court of Appeal rightly held that the finding of the jury that there was no negligence was perverse, that the failure of the jury to find that Cook fired the shot which struck the plaintiff was perverse, that the jury were wrongly charged as to the onus of proof, that the jury ought not to have been discharged by the learned trial judge but should have been sent back with further instructions to endeavour to determine which of the two fired the shot which struck the plaintiff and that the new trial was ordered by the Court of Appeal in a proper exercise of its discretion.\nIt is first necessary to consider the finding of the jury in their answer to the fourth question, that the plaintiff's injuries were not caused by the negligence of either of the defendants, for obviously if this finding stands the action must fail. In my opinion the Court of Appeal were right in deciding that this finding should be set aside. With the greatest respect, I think that the learned trial judge did not charge the jury correctly in regard to the onus of proof of negligence. While it is true that the plaintiff expressly pleaded negligence on the part of the defendants he also pleaded that he was shot by them and in my opinion the action under the old form of plead\u00ading would properly have been one of trespass and not of case. In my view, the cases collected and discussed by Denman J. in Stanley v. Powell[5], establish the rule (which is subject to an exception in the case of highway accidents with which we are not concerned in the case at bar) that where a plaintiff is injured by force applied directly to him by the defendant his case is made by proving this fact and the onus falls upon the defendant to prove \"that such trespass was utterly without his fault.\" In my opinion Stanley v. Powell rightly decides that the defendant in such an action is entitled to judgment if he satisfies the onus of establishing the absence of both inten\u00adtion and negligence on his part.\nOwing to the fact that as Akenhead has not appealed the order directing a new trial must stand so far as he is concerned, I do not find it necessary to discuss whether a jury, properly instructed as to onus, could have absolved him from negligence if they had found that it was he who shot the plaintiff. I think that if the jury found that it was Cook whose shot struck the plaintiff there was no evidence on which, acting judicially, they could have absolved him from negligence. No doubt there was evidence given by Cook which the jury were entitled to believe which nega\u00adtived negligence on his part but such evidence was equally effective to negative the possibility of his having shot the plaintiff, and the jury's answers to questions 1 and 3 read together shew that they cannot have accepted this evidence. The evidence of Cook, himself, appears to me to indicate that in his opinion to have shot in the direction of the clump of trees where the plaintiff was would clearly have been negligent; indeed, he says that it would have been a crazy thing to do.\nFor these reasons, I respectfully agree with the Court of Appeal that the jury's answer to question 4 should be set aside. This, however, is not enough to dispose of the appeal. It is necessary to consider the answer to the 3rd question in which the jury have indicated that they were unable to find which of the two defendants did fire the shot which did the damage.\nThe general rule is, I think, stated correctly in Starkie on Evidence, 4th Edition, 860, quoted with approval by Patterson J.A. in Moxley v. The Canada Atlantic Railway Company[6]:\nThus in practice, when it is certain that one of two individuals committed the offence charged, but it, is uncertain whether the one or the other was the guilty agent, neither of them can be convicted.\nThis rule, I think, is also applicable to civil actions so that if at the end of the case A has proved that he was negligently injured by either B or C but is unable to estab\u00adlish which of the two caused the injury, his action must fail against both unless there are special circumstances which render the rule inapplicable.\nThe respondent argues that such circumstances exist in this case. It is said that Akenhead and Cook were joint tortfeasors being engaged in a joint enterprise under such circumstances that each was liable for the acts of the other. Reliance is placed on the fact that they were hunting together and had agreed to divide the bag evenly.\nI am unable to find any authority for the proposition that the mere fact that a party of persons are hunting together and have agreed to divide the bag renders each liable for the tortious acts of all the others. The American case of Summers v. Tice[7], relied upon by the respond\u00adents is, I think, properly distinguished in the reasons for judgment of Sidney Smith J.A. The decisive finding of fact in that case was that both of the defendants had shot in the direction of the plaintiff when they knew his location. There is no such finding in the case at bar. It is not, I think, necessarily implicit in the jury's findings that one of the two defendants shot the plaintiff but that they can not decide which.\nThe judgments of the Court of Appeal in The Koursk[8], are of only limited assistance as in that case both the Clan Chisholm and the Koursk had been found guilty of negligence causing the sinking of the Itria and the question was not whether both of them were liable but whether their liability was joint or several. At page 155 Scrutton L.J. says:\u2011\nThe substantial question in the present case is: What is meant by \"joint tortfeasors?\" and one way of answering it is: \"Is the cause of action against them the same?\" Certain classes of persons seem clearly to be \"joint tortfeasors\": The agent who commits a tort within the scope of his employment for his principal, and the principal; the servant who commits a tort in the course of his employment, and his master; two persons who agree on common action, in the course of, and to further which, one of them commits a tort. These seem clearly joint tortfeasors; there is one tort committed by one of them on behalf of, or in concert with another.\nThe judgments of Bankes and Sargent, LL.JJ. contain similar expressions.\nCan it be said that the facts of the case at bar fall within the definition of joint tortfeasors, quoted above, from the judgment of Scrutton L.J.-\"two persons who agree on common action in the course of, and to further which, one of them commits a tort?\" It is argued that Cook and Akenhead agreed on common action, that is to go out hunting together and to divide the bag, and that it was in the course of this and in furtherance of if that the shot which injured the plaintiff was fired by one or other of them. The difficulty of applying this definition to the facts of the case at bar is pointed out by Sidney Smith J.A. To do so would bring about the result that every member of a party going out together, with a lawful common object, social or sporting, which could be carried out without negligence, would be vicariously liable for the negligence of any member of the party. So far as I have been able to ascertain, such a liability has not been held in any reported case to exist at common law.\nThere was, I think, no evidence in the case at bar on which it could be found that the relationship of principal and agent or of master and servant or of partners existed between Akenhead and Cook. They were engaged in a lawful pursuit. Neither had any reason to anticipate that the other would act negligently. Neither had in fact either the right or the opportunity to control the other. Neither appears to have assisted or encouraged the other to commit a breach of any duty owed to the plaintiff. It is argued, however, that Summers v. Tice (supra) should be followed and that under the principles stated in that judgment the jury might properly have found both Akenhead and Cook liable for the plaintiff's injury if in their view of the evidence both of them fired in the direction of the clump of trees in which the plaintiff in fact was, under such circumstances that the conduct of each constituted a breach of duty to the plaintiff. I have not been able to find any case in the courts of this country, or of England in which consideration has been given to certain propo\u00adsitions of law laid down in Summers v. Tice. The under-lying reason for the decision appears to me to be found in the following quotation from the case of Oliver v. Miles[9]:\n... We think that ... each is liable for the resulting injury to the boy, although no one can say definitely who actually shot him. To hold otherwise would be to exonerate both from liability, although each was negligent, and the injury resulted from such negligence.\nThe judgment in Summers v. Tice reads in part as follows:\u2011\nWhen we consider the relative position of the parties and the results that would flow if plaintiff was required to pin the injury on one of the defendants only, a requirement that the burden of proof on that subject be shifted to defendants becomes manifest. They are both wrongdoers-both negligent toward plaintiff. They brought about a situation where the negligence of one of them injured the plaintiff, hence, it should rest with them each to absolve himself if he can. The injured party has been placed by defendants in the unfair position of pointing to which defendant caused the harm. If one can escape the other may also and plaintiff is remediless. Ordinarily defendants are in a far better position to offer evidence to determine which one caused the injury. This reasoning has recently found favour in this Court.\nI do not think it necessary to decide whether all that was said in Summers v. Tice should be accepted as stating the law of British Columbia, but I am of opinion, for the reasons given in that case, that if under the circumstances of the case at bar the jury, having decided that the plaintiff was shot by either Cook or Akenhead, found themselves unable to decide which of the two shot him because in their opinion both shot negligently in his direction, both defend-ants should have been found liable. I think that the learned trial judge should have sent the jury back to consider the matter further with a direction to the above effect, in view of their answer to question 3. I agree with my brother Rand that the wording of question 3 was unfortunate and that the jury's answer to it is susceptible of several interpretations, one being that some members of the jury, but not all, were satisfied as to the identity of the defendant whose shot struck the plain-tiff. If this be the right interpretation it would mean that the jury had failed to reach an agreement.\nIt may be that at the new trial no question of the applica\u00adtion of the rule laid down in Summers v. Tice, will arise. I respectfully agree with the Court of Appeal that the jury should have been able to decide which one of the defendants fired the shot which struck the plaintiff.\nIn my respectful opinion the perverse finding on the question of negligence following the insufficient direction on the question of onus, the failure of the jury to reach a finding as to who fired the shot which struck the plaintiff and the failure of the learned trial judge to send them back for reconsideration of this question with the added direction indicated above, made it proper for the Court of Appeal to direct a new trial.\nIn my view the order of the Court of Appeal directing a new trial was not made in the exercise of a judicial dis\u00adcretion in the sense in which that term is used in s. 38 (now s. 44) of the Supreme Court Act, but rather on the Court's view that there existed sufficient grounds in law to entitle the plaintiff to have the judgment set aside and a new trial directed. I think, therefore, that we have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\nThe submission contained in the appellant's factum, that in the event of the appeal failing we should direct separate trials, was withdrawn at the hearing and I, of course, express no opinion in regard to it.\nI would dismiss the appeal and the motion to quash the appeal, both with costs.\nLOCKE J. (dissenting) :\u2011The respondent was on the morning of September 11, 1948, hunting, in company with his brother and one Fitzgerald in the vicinity of Quinsam Lake on Vancouver Island, when he suffered a gun shot wound in respect of which he claimed to recover damages from the appellant and one Akenhead. After a trial before Wood, J. and a special jury the learned trial judge dismissed the action. The respondent appealed and the Court of Appeal[10], considering that the jury had acted perversely in finding that neither of the defendants were negligent, directed a new trial. The defendant Cook alone appeals to this Court from that judgment.\nThere was a great divergence between the accounts given by the respective parties of the facts leading up to the accident. According to the respondent, he was hunting grouse in a cut over area in which there were some scattered clumps of trees about one mile distant from Quinsam Lake when he saw three men who later proved to be Cook, Akenhead and a young boy by the name of Wagstaff, also engaged in hunting, approaching downhill from his right at a distance of about 75 yards. Having seen a grouse fly into a clump of small trees, Lewis moved in a westerly direction towards it. According to him, as he was walking towards the trees, Fitzgerald shouted something which Lewis thought was intended as a warning to the other hunting party of his presence. Proceeding into the trees and at a place where the other hunters were apparently not visible to him, he was struck in the face by a number of pellets of shot and suffered grave injuries. According to Jack Lewis, the respondent's brother, the area was \"very open country, a little bit of shrubbery here and there, a few small snags lying down. It was quite clear except for these few small fir trees off to our left.\" He also had gone towards these small fir trees when he saw the other party approaching and heard Fitzgerald call out something to them. Almost immediately afterwards he heard two shots fired and heard his brother scream and going in to the clump of trees found him at a place some 30 to 35 yards distant from where Cook was standing. Fitzgerald who also said that the respondent and his party approached them travelling downhill said that the three approaching hunters had a pointer dog ranging in front of them and that when they got fairly close:\u2011\nThere was one man closer to me than the others, quite some distance. I didn't bother about the other men, I just watched this one man, I hollered to him to be careful, something to that effect. He seemed to hear me, looked towards me. Practically, at the same time, or just after a few seconds, two shots were fired, one by this man and one by somebody else in his company, which I didn't know then, and a scream at the same time practically. Fitzgerald says that his shout was directed to the man closest to him who turned out to be Cook. He was not clear as to whether he had shouted loud enough to attract Akenhead's attention. A discussion which ensued made it clear that Cook and Akenhead had both fired: Wagstaff had not. Neither the respondent or his brother saw these shots being fired: Fitzgerald appears to have done so but gave no evidence as to the direction in which they were fired.\nAccording to Akenhead, an experienced hunter who had for many years hunted birds in that part of Vancouver Island, he, in company with the appellant, was walking in line in a westerly direction some thirty feet or so apart along a side hill, with Akenhead's dog ranging about forty yards ahead of them when the dog pointed, and as they continued towards him four birds got up, two going to the left, one ahead and one to the right. He said that the birds did not get up from the trees from which the respondent later appeared but from the ground to the right, or north from the trees, and said that he shot off to the right of the dog and not in Lewis' direction. Questioned as to whether he had heard anyone call out before this shot he said that he had not. He said that in accordance with a long-standing arrangement between them when a covey got up, being on the right he would fire at the birds going to the right and Cook those to the left, saying that they had hunted together for years and also that it was their custom to divide up the bag equally between them. Cook, also an experienced hunter, agreed with Akenhead that there were always a great many hunters in that area on the opening day of grouse hunting, and as to the direction in which the three of them were walking and that it was along a side hill and not down hill, as stated by the plaintiff. He said that as they moved along he saw a man off to his left, (who later turned out to be Fitzgerald) who called out to him and pointed to the clog. According to Cook, Fitzgerald had not shouted and he did not hear what he said but having spoken he moved on, apparently in a westerly direction, and when he looked again the man had disappeared. According to his evidence, he thought this man was moving in the same direction as his own party and he himself then continued towards the west when a bird got up straight ahead of him at which he fired. His recollection was that in all there were three shots fired and that his was the first and that it was after the last shot that he heard the respondent scream. Cook said that he did not seen anyone else in the immediate neighbourhood before the shooting other than the man who proved to be Fitzgerald, but that after hearing the respondent's cry the latter appeared from the woods to his left and claimed that he (Cook) had shot him. Im\u00admediately thereafter he said Fitzgerald came running along from a point close to where he had first seen him. Cook claims that he denied having anything to do with it, saying that he had shot straight ahead in front of him, and added:\u2011\nI could not have shot him because I saw a man a little while back. I said I knew the man was in there somewhere, I would not have shot there because I knew a man was there.\nCook having said this on direct examination, the learned trial judge then said:\u2011\nYou say you knew there was a man in there somewhere? I must have missed something. I didn't think you had seen him before.\nwhereupon counsel for the appellant said that Cook was referring to Fitzgerald; this was followed by further questions:\u2011\nThe Court:\nQ. It was only Fitzgerald you had seen, assuming it was Fitzgerald?\u2011A.This man I first saw as he was going in the trees, he was walking down as we were rounding (sic) along this hillside. I presumed he would keep in line as he was walking.\nMr. Cunliffe:\nQ. Is that the man that came and said something you didn't hear?\u2011A. Yes that is the man. I didn't see him after he got in the trees.\nThe Court:\nQ. You knew that Fitzgerald, assuming it was Fitzgerald, was in there some place?\u2011A. Yes. Q. You said \"I knew a man was in there because I had seen him before.\" You had not seen Cook before?\nMr. Cunliffe: You mean Lewis, this is Cook.\nThe Court: Yes.\nQ. You didn't know there were two people there?-A. No I didn't know there were two people. I figured that this man that was shot was the man I had already seen that spoke, he had come down behind the trees.\nAgain the appellant said that he knew the man was on his left and that he had told Lewis that if it had been his shot that struck him it would have killed him, since they were so close. Later, when cross-examined, he said that the only man of the other party of whose presence in the neighbourhood he was aware was Fitzgerald, that he had gone into the trees off to his left, that the birds which he saw get up did not come from the trees but rose from the ground ahead of him.\nThe meaning of much of the evidence of this witness was obscure: thus when cross-examined as to the discussion which took place between him and Lewis after the accident he said:\u2011\nI was not excusing myself. I was explaining to Mr. Lewis it could not have been me, because, I said, I knew there was a man on the right side of those trees. It could not have been my partner, he would not shoot in there. That would be a crazy thing to do. Also I was too close to him. If I had shot it would have killed him.\nFurther questions by the learned trial judge cleared up this statement to this extent that the man to whom he referred was Fitzgerald who, he insisted, he had only seen directly to his left and who, he thought, was proceeding in a parallel direction to that in which he and his associates were walking. What he meant by the expression \"on the right side of those trees\" was not cleared up. Presumably the \"partner\" referred to Akenhead, though why it \"would be a crazy thing\" for the latter to have shot into the trees, if in truth he did not know there was anyone there, is not explained. In a statement given to the police authorities on the day of the accident the appellant, after saying that he had seen a man off to his left who disappeared behind some fir trees, stated that:\u2011\nThe young fellow who I thought I had seen go behind the fir trees came out with blood streaming down his face and accused me of having shot him.\nThe only other material evidence dealing with the occur\u00adrence appears to be that of the boy Wagstaff who saw Fitzgerald when he was speaking to Cook and saw the former point towards the dog and said that while Fitzgerald appeared to speak he could not hear what was said. He thought he had heard three or four shots before the injured man cried out. He had only seen one of the hunters in Lewis' party before the shots were fired and did not see either Cook or Akenhead shoot. He also stated that the birds which were flushed did not come out of the clump of trees where Lewis was, but flew up from the ground about twenty feet distant from the trees.\nThe cause of action pleaded against both defendants was for damages alleged to have been caused:\u2011\nsolely by the negligent conduct of the defendants in recklessly discharging their guns in the direction of the plaintiff, knowing that the plaintiff was in that vicinity, or alternatively, without first making sure that there was no one in the line of fire.\nThe learned trial judge in charging the jury explained to them that the claim was founded in negligence and that the burden of proof lay upon the plaintiff. Having said that negligence was the absence of reasonable care under all the circumstances, he specifically directed their atten\u00adtion to the question as to whether it was negligent under the circumstances then existing to fire into a thicket or clump of trees without first making sure that there was no one there, having in mind that there were a great many people shooting on the opening day, and that Cook at least knew that Fitzgerald was somewhere amongst the trees. Questions were submitted to the jury and were answered as follows:\u2011\nQ. Was the plaintiff shot by either of the defendants?\nA. Yes.\nQ. If so, by which one? (No answer)\nQ. If the plaintiff was shot by one of the defendants are you able to decide by which one?\nA. No.\nQ. Were the plaintiff's injuries caused by the negligence of either of the defendants?\nA. No.\nQ. Damages. (Not answered).\nWood, J. then dismissed the jury and after argument on the following day dismissed the action against both of the defendants.\nIn the Court of Appeal it was contended for the plaintiff that in the circumstances disclosed in the evidence Cook and Akenhead were each liable for the negligence of the other, apparently on the theory that they were joint tort\u00adfeasors or joint adventurers and reliance was placed on an American decision of Summers v. Tice[11], but this con\u00adtention was not sustained. Sidney Smith, J.A. however, who delivered the judgment of the Court, considered that having held that one of the defendants shot the plaintiff the jury acted perversely in finding that neither was negli\u00adgent and that the plaintiff was entitled to a new trial.\nWhile Cook's evidence was that he heard three shots fired and Wagstaff said that he had heard three or four before the injured man cried out and Cook and Akenhead each fired but once, it is apparently common ground that Wagstaff did not shoot and there is no evidence of either Fitzgerald or Jack Lewis firing, or of there having been any other hunters nearby who might have shot and injured the respondent. None of the witnesses for the respondent saw the direction in which Cook and Akenhead fired and both of the latter swore that they had fired in a direction which would have rendered it impossible for the shot to strike Lewis. The jury clearly did not accept the statement of one or other of the defendants on this aspect of the matter, since they found that the plaintiff had been shot by one of them. The task faced by the jury in this case was a difficult one. They had been informed by the learned trial judge that the plaintiff alleging negligence the burden was on him \"to prove his case and to prove that on a pre\u00adponderance of evidence. It is not the same as in a criminal case, where the Crown must prove its case beyond a reason-able doubt.\" In Cottingham v. Longman[12], Duff, J. (as he then was), said that the burden resting upon the plaintiff is to establish facts from which the jury may reasonably draw the inferences necessary to sustain the plaintiff's case and referred to what had been said as to this in Grand Trunk Railway v. Griffith[13], where the nature of proof upon which a jury is entitled to act in civil cases was fully discussed. That the jury understood the matter in this way is, I think, clear from their answer to the first question where in the face of the denials of the parties they drew the inference from the proven facts that one or other of them had injured the plaintiff. On the argument before us, it was contended for the respond\u00adent that in the circumstances there was a presumption of fault against the defendants and that the onus was on them to prove by affirmative evidence that they had exercised due care, but clearly this contention cannot be supported. There were here no circumstances which could, in my opinion, raise any such presumption.\nThe answers to Questions 2 and 3 are decisive that upon the evidence the jury could not find which one of the defendants had fired the shot which caused the damage. The claim against Cook was, therefore, left in this position that either he or Akenhead had fired the shot which injured the unfortunate plaintiff, and upon such a finding it was clearly impossible to enter a verdict against him unless he was liable for the act of Akenhead, whether the claim pleaded sounded in negligence or in trespass. As I under-stand the contention of the respondent, it is that since Cook and Akenhead were hunting together, using the same dog, under an arrangement whereby the bag would be divided equally between them, each was liable for the negligence of the other. Thus, if but one of them had fired, both would be liable. As pointed out in Clerk and Lindsell on Torts, 10th Ed. p. 100, an agent who commits a tort on behalf of his principal and the principal are joint tortfeasors, as are the servant who commits a tort in the course of his employment and his master, and an independ\u00adent contractor and his employer in those cases in which the law holds the employer absolutely liable. The learned author further says that so .are persons whose respective shares in the commission of a tort are done in furtherance of a common design, but that mere similarity of design on the part of independent actors causing independent dam-age is not enough. There must be concerted action towards a common end. A similar passage in the seventh edition of Clerk and Lindsell, it may be noted, was quoted with approval by Sargant, L.J. in The Koursk[14]. The facts in the present matter do not, however, in my opinion, support a claim upon this basis. Cook and Akenhead were merely hunting in each other's company: there was no common design in the sense that that expression is used in the pass-age quoted: they were rather each pursuing their own design of shooting grouse, as they were lawfully entitled to do. I am unable to understand how the fact that, like most hunters, they at the end of the day divided up the bag, the more fortunate sharing his luck with the other, can be a basis for any legal liability. There was here no joint venture but rather individual ventures carried on by these hunters in each other's company and I see no ground upon which one could be held responsible for the negligence of the other. I agree with the conclusion of Sidney Smith, J.A. on this aspect of the matter.\nIn my opinion, this is decisive of the present appeal since, in the absence of a finding that the respondent was shot by Cook and since the latter is not liable if the damage was caused by the act of Akenhead, the action was properly dismissed. In the judgment appealed from, however, a new trial has been ordered on the ground that the jury's answer to the fourth question was perverse, in view of the finding that it was one or other of the defendants who fired the shots causing the damage. With great respect, it appears to me that in view of the failure of the plaintiff to obtain a finding from the jury as to which fired the shot, this question did not arise. A finding that one or other of the defendants was negligent would clearly not have furthered the matter in view of the answer to the third question. If it were necessary to decide the matter I would, however, come to a different conclusion than that reached by the Court of Appeal. In my opinion, it cannot be said that the answer made to the fourth question was so un-reasonable and unjust as to justify an appellate court in concluding that the jury could not have been acting judicially (C.N.R. v. Muller[15]: Duff, C.J.C. at p. 769; Lamont, J. at pp. 772-3).\nThe respondent's case is that Cook is liable, even though it was not his act but that of Akenhead which caused the damage. As to the latter his evidence, which the jury may well have accepted, was to the effect that he had not heard Fitzgerald call out to Cook and did not know when he fired that there was anyone in the clump of trees. The jury may have believed these statements and since the learned trial judge had expressly directed their attention to the question as to whether to fire into a clump of trees without first making certain that no person was there was in itself a negligent act, I am quite unable to understand how it could be said that a finding that even if Akenhead did fire in to the trees he was not negligent, could be set aside as perverse. As to Cook he had sworn, as had Aken\u00adhead, that he did not fire in to the trees where Lewis was, but off to the right where no damage could result and it appears to me that if the jury accepted this statement it could not properly be said that a finding that he was not negligent was perverse.\nThis appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and the judgment at the trial restored. The motion to quash the appeal made on behalf of the respondent should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: F. S.

Hamildoc to Saguenay Terminals Limited. Demarara Bauxite Company Limited shipped a cargo of bauxite upon the vessel from a port in British Guiana for delivery to a port in Trinidad, for reforwarding to the plaintiff at Arvida, P.Q. The bill of lading was signed by an agent of Saguenay Terminals Ltd. at Georgetown on behalf of the master. The cargo was lost at sea, owing to the unseaworthiness of the vessel, and the holder of the bill of lading claiming as the owner and consignee of the goods sought to recover its value from the appellant. The appellant contended that it was not bound by the contract evidenced by the bill of lading and that there was no privity of contract as between the parties. The action was maintained by the Superior Court and by the Court of Appeal for Quebec. Held, dismissing the appeal, that the charter party was not a demise of the ship and the appellant was the carrier of the goods; the respondent as the owner and consignee of the goods was entitled to sue upon the bill of lading.\nWehner v. Dene Steam Shipping Co. [1905] 2 K.B. 92 and Carver, 9th Edition, p. 250 referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, maintaining the action of the consignee of a cargo against the owner of a ship lost at sea.\nC. R. McKenzie K.C. for the appellant.\nR. C. Holden K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Rand and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014This action was brought by the owner of goods against the owner of the ship Hamildoc for the loss of the goods through the unseaworthiness of the vessel. This ground of liability, although strongly resisted in the courts below, was abandoned before us; and the only question now in the appeal is one of parties: whether the appellant is liable directly to the respondent for the loss.\nThe contention that that is not so arises from the fact that the vessel was under a time charter party to the Saguenay Terminals Limited of Montreal. The charter was executed at Montreal on September 16, 1941 and by its terms the use of the vessel was to be enjoyed by the charterers for \"about\" six months. The special purpose in mind, although the charter was not limited to it, was to carry bauxite from South American points to Trinidad for furtherance to Canadian and United States points.\nThe usual provisions of such a charter were stipulated. The owner was to be paid a specified sum monthly; the captain was to prosecute the voyages with despatch: although appointed by the owner, he was to, be under the orders and direction of the charterers as regards employment and agency; and the latter were to load, stow and trim the cargo at their expense under the supervision of the captain who was to sign bills of lading for cargo as presented in conformity with notes or tally clerk's receipts. The owner was to pay for all provisions and the wages of captain and crew; and maintain the vessel in her class and efficiency. By clause 26 nothing in the charter was to be construed as a demise of the vessel and the owner was to remain responsible for the navigation of the vessel, insurance, crew and all other matters, the same as when trading for its own account.\nUnder such a charter, and in the absence of an undertaking on the part of the charterer, the owner remains the carrier for the shipper, and in issuing bills of lading the captain acts as his agent. In this case, the bill of lading was signed for the captain by the agents appointed by the charterers certainly for themselves and probably for the vessel also and that fact raises the first of the only two points deserving consideration.\nIt is, I think, too late in the day to call in question the relation of the time charterer or his or the ship's agent towards cargo. The charterer has purchased the benefit of the carrying space of the ship; he is the only person interested in furnishing cargo; and the captain is bound to sign the bills of lading as presented, assuming them not to be in conflict with the terms of the charter party. The practical necessities involved in that situation were long ago appreciated by the courts and the authority of the charterer to sign for the captain confirmed.\nFor the purpose of committing cargo to carriage, the captain, the charterer and the ship's agent are all agents of the owner, acting in the name of the captain; and where the charterer has the authority, as here, to sign for the captain, that he may appoint and act by an agent would seem to me to be unquestionable. To hold him to a personal performance would, under modern conditions of traffic, be an intolerable restriction.\nIn Wehner v. Dene 2, the bill of lading was signed by the captain but the question was, on whose behalf, the owner's or charterer's, and Channel J. held it to be the former.\nIn Kuntsford v. Filmanns 3, both the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords affirmed the holding of Channel J., that under the clause obligating the captain to sign bills of lading as presented, the charterer could sign for him as representing the owner. It was pointed out that the question of the person undertaking the carriage of the goods for the shipper was one of fact: but that in the normal practice under a time charter, that undertaking was by the captain for the owner. The same view was taken by the Court of Appeal in Limerick v. Coker 4. Here, the charterers had their own steamship line and used one of their own bill of lading forms; but they had signed them on behalf of the captain.\nIn Urleston v. Weir 5, the charterers had signed the bills of lading and contended that they were the parties to the contract; but the court held against them. A similar ruling was made in SS. Iristo, Middleton v. Ocean Dom. S.S. Co. 6. In Baumwall v. Furness 7, the remarks of Lord Herschell at pp. 17 and 18 are to the same effect.\nFinally, in Larrinaja v. The King 8, Lord Wright, at pp. 254-5, deals with the words \"employment and agency\" which appear in the present charterparty, and which he treats as referring to the ship: \"'Employment' means employment of the ship to carry out the purposes for which the charterers wish to use her\"; \"'Agency' deals with another aspect of the ship's affairs. The shipowner is entitled in the ordinary course to decide to what firm or person in each port the ship in the course of the charter-party is to be consigned as agent. The selection is here left to the charterers. This is an important matter, because of the multifarious duties and responsibilities which may fall to be discharged according to the mercantile law by the ship's agents.\"\nThat Sproston's Limited were authorized by the charterers to act as they did in signing the bills of lading is not seriously to be questioned. The argument against their authority is really that neither the owner nor the captain had anything to do with their appointment; but that contention overlooks the point that the owner has authorized the charterers to sign and that they in turn can do so by agents. The remaining question is whether the respondent is a consignee named in the bill of lading. That document acknowledges the shipment by Demerara Bauxite Company Ltd. on board the Hamildoc of the cargo \"to be delivered in like order and condition at the port of Chaguaramas, Trinidad, B.W.I. or so near thereto as she may safely get, always afloat, unto For re-forwarding to Aluminum Co. of Canada, Arvida, P.Q., Canada, (or to his or their assigns) on payment of freight and charges thereon in cash without deduction, credit or discount, unless prepaid.\" The form used was printed and the space for the name of the consignee was filled out in typewriting. From such language I cannot see how any doubt can arise that the Aluminum Company is the named consignee. Transshipment was involved and as the ship undertook only to deliver at the first port, the necessary implication is that the acceptance and forwarding there would be made by some person with responsibility for seeing that the transit was continued to Arvida. The Aluminum Company is named as the ultimate consignee, and it is impliedly so at the intermediate port. In the absence of any contrary indication, the ultimate consignee is the consignee at every stage of the transit; each section of the carriage is directed towards furthering the goods to him; and the intermediate agencies are his, serving the same end and purpose.\nThe respondent is therefore the named consignee; and that title to the bauxite passed to it on the consignment is equally clear. It is mere trifling with the facts to suggest anything else. \"Consigning\" goods is delivering them to a carrier who accepts them as initiating his obligation to carry and deliver. The bill of lading is to evidence the terms of the undertaking and to operate as a document of title. Whether it is issued five seconds or five hours after the last pound has been stowed is immaterial; in either case it takes effect as from the moment of the commencement of the duty of the carrier as such. The title passes to the purchaser when the goods have been committed to the vessel for the journey; that is, it has passed on the \"consignment\" and the requirement of the Bills of Lading Act has been satisfied.\nThe appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs. The judgment of Taschereau and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nLocke J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench for Quebec (Appeal Side) 9, dismissing an appeal by the present appellant from a judgment delivered in the Superior Court by Salvas J., whereby the appellant was found liable to the respondent for the value of a cargo lost in the sinking of the SS. Hamildoc off the coast of Venezuela in January, 1943.\nThe respondent's claim as pleaded is that by a bill of lading dated at Georgetown, British Guiana, on December 22, 1942, the appellant acknowledged that there had been shipped in apparent good order and condition on board the SS. Hamildoc by Demerara Bauxite Company Limited 3,033 long tons of Demerara Bauxite for carriage to and delivery at the Port of Chaguaramas, Trinidad, for reforwarding to the plaintiff at Arvida, P.Q.: that the plaintiff was the holder of the bill of lading and at all material times the owner and consignee of the goods and that: \"in breach of the contract evidenced by the said bill of lading and\/or of its duty in the premises implied by law the defendant failed to carry the said goods safely to the said Port of Chaguaramas or to deliver them there in good order or at all.\"\nBy the statement of defence, among other matters to be hereinafter referred to, the appellant pleaded that the loss of the Hamildoc was due to perils, dangers and accidents of the sea and that the defendant was not liable under the terms of the bill of lading. By way of answer the respondent alleged that the loss arose from the fact that the ship was unseaworthy at the time the voyage was undertaken. Upon this issue the learned trial judge found that the loss of the cargo was due to the unseaworthiness of the vessel and, further, that the appellant had failed to prove that it had exercised due diligence to make her seaworthy before her last voyage, and these findings were upheld on appeal. There being concurrent findings on this question of fact the question was not argued before us.\nIn so far as they are relevant to the other questions to be decided upon this appeal, the facts are as follows: the appellant company is a ship owner and operator, and by a charterparty dated September 16, 1941, chartered the Hamildoc to Saguenay Terminals Limited for a term of six months, with an option to continue the charter for a further period. The instrument was a time charter and not a demise of the vessel and provided, inter alia, that the owners should have a lien upon all cargoes and all sub-freights for any amounts due under the charter, including general average contributions. By clause 8 it was provided:\nThat the Captain shall prosecute his voyages with the utmost despatch, and shall render all customary assistance with ship's crew and boats. The Captain (although appointed by the owners), shall be under the orders and directions of the charterers as regards employment and agency; and charterers are to load, stow, and trim the cargo at their expense under the supervision of the Captain, who is to sign bills of lading for cargo as presented, in conformity with Mate's or Tally Clerk's receipts.\nIt was further stipulated that all bills of lading should include a Both-to-Blame Collision Clause which would impose certain obligations towards the ship owner upon the owner of cargo carried, in the event of collision with another ship as the result of negligent navigation of both ships, and an Amended Jason Clause imposing liability in certain circumstances on the cargo owner to contribute with the ship owner in general average. At the time the shipment in question was made in British Guiana, the Hamildoc was being operated under the terms of this charter by Saguenay Terminals Limited, a subsidiary of the respondent company.\nThe lost shipment was part of a large quantity of bauxite purchased by the respondent company from Demerara Bauxite Company Limited, (a company organized in the Colony of British Guiana) by a contract dated May 1, 1942. By the terms of that agreement, wherein the vendor was referred to as Demerara and the purchaser Alcan, the respondent agreed to purchase its requirements of bauxite for the balance of the year 1942 on defined conditions, including the following:\nDemerara shall deliver the bauxite, trimmed in ship's hold, at Mackenzie, B.G. Transportation of the herein described bauxite shall be effected by Alcan, who will however retain Saguenay Terminals Ltd. as \"Forwarding Agents\". All ocean freight, marine insurance, and other charges related to transportation of the bauxite after it is delivered, trimmed in ship's hold, at Mackenzie, British Guiana, shall be borne by Alcan. The cargo in question was delivered by the Demerara Company on board the Hamildoc at Mackenzie. The bill of lading issued was upon a form bearing the heading \"Saguenay Terminals Limited\" and the name of the respondent company did not appear. It acknowledged, as alleged in the declaration, the receipt of the shipment, the place of its destination and in the blank space left for the insertion of the name of the consignee there appeared the words:\nFor reforwarding to Aluminum Company of Canada, Arvida, P.Q. Canada (or to his or their assigns).\nAs stipulated in the charterparty the bill of lading contained, inter alia, the Both-to-Blame Collision Clause and the Amended Jason Clause. A further term provided that:\nIt is hereby understood and agreed that if Saguenay Terminals Limited are not the owners of the vessel named herein, the shippers, consignees and other persons interested in the goods landed hereby will make and enforce all claims arising under this contract of purchase, whether or not based upon a breach of warranty or seaworthiness, solely against the vessel named herein and\/or her owners.\nIn the clause reserved for the signature the following appeared:\nIn witness whereof, the Master, or agent on behalf of the Master of the said vessel has affirmed to 2 Bills of Lading, all of this tenor and date, one of which accomplished, the others stand void.\nSprostons Limited\nBruce Brebner,\nMaster, or Agents.\nBy its statement of defence the appellant alleged, inter alia, that the bill of lading \"was not issued by, nor is it a contract to which the defendant is a party\" (para. 5), and again:\nThat there is no lien de droit between the Plaintiff and Defendant and the Plaintiff is an entire stranger to any and all rights in, to and under the said time charter.\n(para. 6).\nIt was not suggested by the respondent that it was a party to or claimed any rights under the charterparty, its claim being as shown by the complaint founded upon the contract evidenced by the bill of lading and of the \"duty in the premises implied by law\", which latter phrase was apparently intended as a claim in tort for injury occasioned to the respondent's goods by the carrier's negligence. While denying that there was any contract between itself and the cargo owners, the appellant had, in answer to the claim that the loss was occasioned by the ship being unseaworthy, pleaded that the bill of lading was to be construed in accordance with the provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act of British Guiana and that the appellant had exercised due diligence to make the ship in all respects seaworthy, and further that the loss had been occasioned by perils of the sea, an exception to the owner's liability provided by that statute. These pleas were raised in the alternative and, as has been stated, failed.\nAs to the liability of the appellant upon the contract evidenced by the bill of lading: the charterparty was a time charter and not a demise of the vessel and provided, inter alia, that the owner was to remain responsible for the navigation of the vessel as when trading for its own account. The Both-to-Blame Collision Clause, which it was stipulated should be included in any bill of lading issued, provided that:\nIf the ship owner shall have exercised due diligence to make the ship seaworthy and properly manned, equipped and supplied, it is hereby agreed that in the event of the ship coming into collision with another ship as a result of the negligent navigation of both ships, the owners of the cargo carried under this bill of lading.\nwould indemnify the ship owner in a certain manner, recognizing, in my opinion, the obligation of the owner towards cargo owners for the seaworthiness and proper manning and equipment of the ship. The provision that this clause and the Amended Jason Clause should be included in the bills of lading shows that it was contemplated that there should be a contractual relationship established as between the ship and the cargo owners under the contracts of carriage to be issued. The terms of the charterparty, that cargoes would be taken on or discharged at any place as the charterers or their agents might direct and that the Captain should sign bills of lading for cargo as presented, make it clear that it was intended that the charterers would prepare and issue the bills of lading.\nWhile the charterer was thus empowered to decide on the manner of the employment of the ship and to appoint agents for the ship at points of call, possession of the vessel remained in the appellant through the Captain. The rule applicable is stated by Channell J. in Wehner v. Dene Steam Shipping Company 10, as being that in ordinary cases, where the charterparty does not amount to a demise of the ship and possession remains with the owner, the contract is made not with the charterer but with the owner. In Carver, 9th Ed. p. 250, the following passage appears:\nIt would seem then that the ship owner is a party to the bill of lading contract; and, that being so, he must be entitled on his side to treat the contract of the shipper as made with himself as principal and to sue for breaches of it. This is, in fact, recognized by allowing him to make claims under the bills of lading against consignees; for example, for demurrage and for freight, even though the bills of lading refer to a charter party. In effect, then, the contract is in general with the ship owner; and the master should be regarded as having made it on his behalf and not on behalf of the charterer.\nThis appears to me to be an accurate statement of the law relating to a charterparty such as this.\nAs to the signature upon the present bill of lading, apart, from any question as to whether by virtue of the terms of clause 8, Sprostons Limited as the agents designated by the respondent were not authorized to sign on behalf of the master, a practice was established that this should be done if the evidence of the witness Farrar, the Traffic Superintendent of Sprostons Limited, is to be accepted. McEwen, the manager of the appellant company, gave evidence that the Hamildoc was but one of sixteen ships owned by the appellant which were chartered to Saguenay Terminals Limited, for use in what was called the shuttle trade between British Guiana and Trinidad and other ports to which bauxite was consigned. The bauxite was loaded at Mackenzie and the information required for the preparation of the shipping documents was cabled from that place to Sprostons at Georgetown. According to this witness, Sprostons Limited signed the bills of lading for the masters of the ships of the appellant from the time they started carrying bauxite towards the end of 1941 until they ceased to do so at the end of 1943 or early in 1944. When a particular vessel carrying this cargo arrived at Georgetown from Mackenzie, one of the clerks from Sprostons Shipping Department would go aboard the vessel, taking with him the bill of lading theretofore prepared, and after checking this with the particulars shown on the dead weight survey and loading scale, which he would receive from the captain, he would hand the latter a copy of the bill of lading, the manifest, the dead weight survey and the ship's loading scale. This was done throughout this period without objection. According to Farrar, S. W. McElroy, a superintendent of the appellant who was in Georgetown as the representative of the appellant, was aware of this practice. McElroy, however, denied this and McEwen also said that he was unaware that the bills of lading were being signed in this manner. Both of these witnesses in fact said that the Naval Control Headquarters at Georgetown enforced secrecy in regard to shipments from that port and forbade the issue of bills of lading. The learned trial judge made no finding upon the question of credibility as betwen these witnesses but found that, under the terms of the charterparty, Sprostons Limited were lawfully fulfilling an obligation imposed upon the master in signing the bills of lading, and that the latter was binding upon the appellant and evidenced the contract of carriage between the parties. Bissonnette J. apparently considered that the evidence of Farrar had not been met by the contrary evidence tendered on behalf of the defendant, a conclusion with which I agree. Hyde J., considering that by virtue of the terms of the charter-party, Sprostons Limited as the agents appointed by the charterers were entitled to sign for the master and thus bind the appellant, did not deal with the question. While the two named officers of the appellant said that they were unaware that this was being done, this may merely indicate that they were not giving close attention to what was transpiring as the various vessels called at Georgetown over this period of years. Without any more assistance than is to be obtained from an examination of the evidence and the perusal of the reasons for judgment which have been given, I think Farrar's evidence on the point is to be accepted.\nIn my opinion, the appellant was the carrier of the goods under the terms of a contract evidenced by the bill of lading. The respondent was the holder of the bill of lading but, so far as appears from the evidence, that document was not endorsed to it by the shipper Demerara Bauxite Company Limited. Clearly, under the contract for the purchase of bauxite between the Demerara Company and the respondent, title to the shipment of ore passed when delivery was made on the Hamildoc at Mackenzie. By reason of this fact the appellant contends that there is no right of action in the respondent in respect of these goods, in view of the decision of this Court in The Insurance Company of North America v. Colonial Steamships Limited 11. That decision involved the interpretation of section 2 of the Bills of Lading Act. c. 17, R.S.C. 1927, which reads as follows:\nEvery consignee of goods named in the bill of lading and every endorsee of a bill of lading to whom the property in the goods therein mentioned passes upon or by reason of such consignment or endorsement shall have and be vested with all such rights of actions and be subject to all such liabilities in respect of such goods as if the contract contained in the bill of lading had been made with himself.\nNo evidence was given as to the law of British Guiana where the contract of carriage was made, so that it must be assumed that it is the same as in the Province of Quebec. The decision in the Colonial Steamships Case followed the decision of the House of Lords in Sewell v. Burdick 12, and in each of these cases the claims advanced were by persons claiming as endorsees of the bill of lading. It appears unnecessary to consider the other facts which differentiate these decisions from the present matter, since here the respondent does not claim as endorsee of the contract but as the consignee named in the contract and as the owner of the goods. While the language of the bill of lading is in this respect unusual, I agree with Hyde J. that it should be interpreted as naming the respondent company as the consignee of the shipment and thus entitled to sue upon the contract. In the view I take of the matter, it is unnecessary to consider the claim based upon the appellant's negligence. The learned trial judge found that, even if the bill of lading was not binding upon the appellant, the action should succeed since, in the absence of proof to the contrary, it was to be assumed that the common law of British Guiana was to the same effect as Article 1675 of the Civil Code which, in declaring the liability of carriers, says that they are liable:\nfor the loss and damage of things entrusted to them, unless they can prove that such loss or damage was caused by a fortuitous event or irresistible force or has arisen from a defect in the thing itself. The learned judges of the Court of Appeal did not consider it necessary to deal with this aspect of the matter.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nEstey J.:\u2014The respondent, Aluminum Company of Canada Limited, brings this action as consignee under a bill of lading dated Georgetown, British Guiana, December 22, 1942, claiming damages for the loss of a cargo of bauxite shipped on the steamship Hamildoc which, on January 1, 1943, foundered at sea while en route to its port of discharge, Chaguaramas, Trinidad, B.W.I. The entire cargo was lost. The Hamildoc was loaded at Mackenzie (70 miles up the Demerara River from Georgetown, British Guiana).\nThe Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side 13, for the Province of Quebec affirmed the learned trial judge's finding that the loss was due to the unseaworthy condition of the Hamildoc when it sailed on its final voyage. It was, upon the hearing of this appeal, not contended that this concurrent finding of fact should be set aside.\nThe main issues in this Court concern the validity of the bill of lading, the appellant contending that it was in no way a party thereto; that Sprostons Limited, in signing the bill of lading, was not its agent and was not requested by the master of the vessel or by any other person on its behalf to do so; that never, at any time prior to these proceedings, did it have any knowledge thereof and, moreover, even if Sprostons Limited did act as agent, that the respondent, as consignee therein, cannot recover by virtue of the provisions of sec. 2 of the Bills of Lading Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 17); and finally that if the bill of lading was issued it was in contravention of the prohibition issued by the Naval Control authorities.\nThe respondent, a producer of aluminum, entered into a contract with the Demerara Bauxite Company Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Demerara), at Mackenzie, British Guiana, on the 8th day of June, 1942, whereby it agreed to purchase from that company all its requirements of bauxite for the year 1942. The bauxite was to be shipped as ordered and para. 5 of this contract reads as follows:\nDemerara shall deliver the bauxite trimmed in ship's hold, at Mackenzie, B.G. Transportation of the herein described bauxite shall be effected by Alcan, who will however retain Saguenay Terminals Ltd. as \"Forwarding Agents.\" All ocean freight, marine insurance, and other charges related to transportation of the bauxite after it is delivered, trimmed in ship's hold, at Mackenzie, British Guiana, shall be borne by Alcan.\nThe word \"Demerara\" in the foregoing paragraph refers to the Demerara Bauxite Company Ltd. and the word \"Alcan\" to the respondent.\nThe respondent entered into a verbal contract with the Saguenay Terminals Limited to transport the bauxite from Mackenzie to Trinidad and from Trinidad to Arvida, Quebec. Saguenay Terminals Limited had vessels of their own, but chartered others, including the Hamildoc, from the appellant. This charterparty is dated September 16, 1941. It is a time charterparty and cl. 8 thereof reads, in part, as follows:\n8. That the Captain shall prosecute his voyages with the utmost despatch, and shall render all customary assistance with ship's crew and boats. The Captain (although appointed by the owners), shall be under the orders and directions of the Charterers as regards employment and agency; and Charterers are to load, stow, and trim the cargo at their expense under the supervision of the Captain, who is to sign Bills of Lading for cargo as presented, in conformity with Mate's or Tally Clerk's receipts \u2026\nMoreover, cl. 26 provided:\n26. Nothing herein stated is to be construed as a demise of the vessel to the Time Charterers. The owners to remain responsible for the navigation of the vessel, insurance, crew, and all other matters, same as when trading for their own account.\nNot only is the issue of bills of lading provided for as in cl. 8, but a War Risks Clause, New Jason Clause, Both-to-Blame Collision Clause, U.S.A. Clause Paramount and Canadian Clause Paramount were incorporated in the charterparty. These provided that all bills of lading shall include the Both-to-Blame Collision Clause which provided that the owners of the cargo would, in certain circumstances, indemnify the shipowner; that the New Jason Clause should also be included in all bills of lading which, in certain circumstances, provided that the shippers, consignees or owners of the cargo \"shall contribute with the shipowner in general average.\" The Clause Paramount provided that the bill of lading should have effect, subject to the Water Carriage of Goods Act 1936 (S. of C. 1936, c. 49). The War Risks Clause was with respect to non-issue of bills of lading to blockaded ports, etc., and the liberty of the ship to comply with orders given by the government of the Nation under whose flag the vessel was sailing.\nIt is conceded that this was a time charterparty under which the captain and his crew, as servants of the owner, remain in charge of the ship which, therefore, remains in the possession of the owner while the charterers direct the use thereof.\nThe foregoing cl. 8 is a well-known provision in charter-parties and the sentence \"The captain (although appointed by the owners), shall be under the orders and directions of the charterers as regards employment and agency; \u2026\" is similar to that construed by the House of Lords in Larrinaga Steamship Company, Limited v. The King 14, where, at p. 254, Lord Wright stated:\n\"Employment\" means employment of the ship to carry out the purposes for which the charterers wish to use her; \"agency\" deals with another aspect of the conduct of the ship's affairs. The shipowner is entitled in the ordinary course to decide to what firm or person in each port the ship in the course of the charterparty is to be consigned as agent. The selection is here left to the charterers. That is an important matter because of the multifarious duties and responsibilities which may fall to be discharged according to mercantile law by the ships' agents.\nUnder this cl. 8 the parties provided that the captain \"is to sign bills of lading for cargo as presented, in conformity with mate's or tally clerk's receipts.\" It is not suggested throughout the record that the parties to the charterparty ever agreed to the deletion or the variation of this provision. Moreover, apart from the charterparty, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act of British Guiana, which is the same as The Water Carriage of Goods Act 1986 (S. of C. 1936, c. 49), expressly contemplates the issue of bills of lading.\nThe bill of lading covering this particular shipment contained the aforementioned War Risks Clause, New Jason Clause, Both-to-Blame Collison Clause and U.S.A. Clause Paramount and, in part, it read as follows:\nShipped in apparent good order and condition by Demerara Bauxite Co. Ltd. on board the Steamship Hamildoc whereof R. P. Legendre is Master, now lying at the Port of Georgetown B.G. \u2026 3,033 long tons (more or less) Demerara bauxite \u2026 to be delivered \u2026 at the Port of Chaguaramas, Trinidad B.W.I. \u2026 for reforwarding to Aluminum Co. of Canada, Arvida P.Q. Canada.\"\nand is signed:\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Master, or Agent on behalf of the Master of the said vessel \u2026\nDated at Georgetown this 22 Dec. 1942.\nSprostons Limited\nBruce Brebner,\nMaster, or Agents.\nWhile not signed by the master or captain personally, this bill of lading does purport to be signed by appellant's agents, Sprostons Limited.\nThe plant and dock superintendent of Demerara deposed that as the bauxite was loaded into the Hamildoc it was checked \"either by the captain or one of his officers1\" and that seven copies of a document styled a \"Dead Weight Survey,\" showing the tonnage of the bauxite on board, were prepared and signed, by himself. Two of these were retained by the company at Mackenzie \"and the remaining five copies were forwarded to Sprostons Limited in Georgetown in a closed envelope in care of the captain.\"\nThe traffic superintendent of Sprostons Limited deposed that Sprostons Limited was agent for Paterson Steamships Limited and that, as agents, it signed bills of lading for the Paterson steamships engaged in the same service as the Hamildoc, both before and after its sailing on December 22, 1942. He pointed out that when the Hamildoc was loaded at Mackenzie the information necessary for the preparation of the bill of lading was radioed to Sprostons Limited; that as agents for Demerara they prepared the bill of lading and when the ship docked at Georgetown an employee went aboard with the bill of lading and received \"from the captain an envelope containing copies of Dead Weight Survey and Loading Scale, which envelope had been handed to the master on his departure from Mackenzie.\" He checked the figures in these documents with the bill of lading as it had been prepared and when his work was concluded he left a copy of the bill of lading with the captain and the original and a copy were forwarded to respondent. This practice, he stated, continued in respect of the vessels of Paterson Steamships Limited until they were taken off the service in 1943.\nIn November, 1941, the appellant had sent a representative to Georgetown \"To generally supervise and see that the money and office work was done as far as the boats were concerned.\" This representative was present at Georgetown when the Hamildoc was there in December, 1942, and deposes that he did not see any bill of lading. So far as he knew the captain did not issue a bill of lading and, in reference to their practice: \"We never issued any bills of lading for our boats on that shuttle service;\" that Sprostons Limited did other work such as making repairs to the ship for the appellant. Their offices were across the street and \"\u2026we were all the time in contact\" and \"We had to work very, very closely together \u2026\" and, while he made the disbursements to Sprostons Limited, he says he never paid an agency fee. He says that the \"Naval Control\" \"issued instructions that I was not to document the ships, and I never had any occasion to go and ask them to change that.\"\nThe captain also deposed that he did not have or receive a bill of lading, and other captains in the service deposed to the same effect.\nThe foregoing evidence of the plant and dock superintendent, as well as that of the traffic superintendent, is in accord with the terms of the charterparty and with what is the general practice among shippers, carriers and consignees. A bill of lading is not only evidence of the agreement between the shipper and the carrier, but through it the goods may be transferred. That so important a document should have been discarded and no substitute provided therefor in respect of shipments extending throughout so substantial a period of time is difficult to accept. Respondent, however, submits, as its justification, the orders of the Naval Control authorities. These orders, it was suggested, were similar to the Defence of Canada Regulations, but were not proved nor was our attention directed to any provision under which judicial notice might be taken thereof. In order to succeed upon this basis, the respondent should have proved the orders in order that their effect might have been determined.\nIt follows that the finding of the trial judge, affirmed as it was by the Court of King's Bench, that the bill of lading was signed by Sprostons Limited, acting on behalf of the master, is supported by the evidence and ought not to be disturbed.\nThe appellant further contends that the respondent, as consignee, cannot succeed under this bill of lading because it is not a party to whom the property in the goods therein mentioned passed upon or by reason of such consignment within the meaning of sec. 2 of the Bills of Lading Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 17, s. 2). Sec. 2 reads as follows:\n2. Every consignee of goods named in a bill of lading, and every endorsee of a bill of lading to whom the property in the goods therein mentioned passes upon or by reason of such consignment or endorsement, shall Clave and be vested with all such rights of action and be subject to all such liabilities in respect of such goods as if the contract contained in the bill of lading has been made with himself.\nThis section, originally sec. 1 of the Bills of Lading Act 1889 (S. of C. 1889, c. 30), was enacted in order that the consignee might bring an action under the bill of lading in his own name, provided, of course, he otherwise came within the terms of the section. The precise contention of the appellant is that the respondent was the owner of the bauxite before the issue of the bill of lading, by virtue of the provision in cl. 5 of the Agreement for Sale under which Demerara was required to \"deliver the bauxite, trimmed in ship's hold, at Mackenzie, B.G.,\" a place seventy miles up the Demerara River from Georgetown, and, therefore, the property in the bauxite did not pass to it \"by reason of such consignment.\"\nThis cl. 5 is part of the Agreement for Sale and cl. 4 thereof reads:\n4. Alcan shall order the said bauxite by means of one or more purchase orders issued to Demerara as soon as possible, and containing instructions concerning shipments, billing, and the various necessary documents.\nThese clauses 4 and 5 must be read together and the entire agreement must, I think, be read and construed in relation to the usual practice of the trade. This Agree- ment for Sale contemplated that orders would be given by the respondent and filled by Demerara by delivering the bauxite as aforesaid and following the instructions with respect to billing. The instructions contemplated in cl. 4 were given under date of May 26, 1942, and provided that Demerara would send one original ocean bill of lading to the respondent, Montreal, Quebec, and one non-negotiable copy of the ocean bill of lading to the Saguenay Terminals Limited at Montreal. It, therefore, would appear that the parties intended that the title should pass to the bauxite when \"trimmed in ship's hold\" and the shipping documents prepared in accordance with the instructions given. These instructions and the practice developed thereunder were followed throughout 1942. Sprostons Limited were agents for Demerara and the latter apparently followed the practice, as already outlined, of having the bill of lading prepared by its agents at Georgetown with the full knowledge and acquiescence of all parties concerned and, under these circumstances, it cannot be said that the title to the bauxite passed to the respondent until such time as the bill of lading was executed and mailed by Demerara, or its agents, addressed to the respondent. If the point were in issue, I should be prepared to hold that when so mailed and executed the bill of lading related back to, and became effective as of the time when the loading was completed. In Delaurier v. Wyllie 15, the purchasers (Delaurier & Company) agreed to buy from Stevenson & Company coal to be shipped as follows:\n\u2026 delivery by steamer of 800 to 1,000 tons, ready to load and sail second fortnight in May.\nStevenson & Company chartered a ship and named itself as consignee in the bill of lading, which it endorsed to Delaurier & Company. The ship with its cargo was lost and Delaurier & Company sued the ship owners (Wyllie and Others) on the bill of lading. Lord Shand, at p. 180, stated:\nIn my opinion, the contract between Messrs. Stevenson & Company of Glasgow and the pursuers (Delaurier & Company) was fully executed and completed as soon as the coals were shipped on board of the vessel and the bill of lading was transmitted by Stevenson & Company to the pursuers. The case of Delaurier v. Wyllie supra dealt not only with a shipment of coal, but also with one of iron, and while the property did pass in respect to the iron, the property did not pass by virtue of the endorsement of the bill of lading. There the shippers were instructed to, and did purchase the iron as agents for the endorsees of the bill of lading. When shipped, the bill of lading covering the iron showed the agents as consignees and they endorsed the bill of lading to their principals. In these circumstances Lord Shand stated at p. 184:\nIt was taken in favour of the charterers, and must be regarded even in the pursuers' hands as being merely a receipt for the goods, because the indorsation by the charterer did not operate any transfer of the goods, as in the case of a purchaser for value, the goods being at shipment the property of the pursuers.\nThis case is also distinguishable from The Insurance Company of North America v. Colonial Steamships Limited 16, where an endorsement of the bill of lading was made for the purpose of presenting a claim to the insurance company and it was held that a subsequent endorsement to the insurance company which acquired the goods by reason of its obligations under its policy, certificate and attached endorsement did not bring the insurance company within the language of the aforesaid sec. 2 of the Bills of Lading Act.\nThe appellant's position is not improved because the Hamildoc would have unloaded the cargo at Chaguaramas instead of Arvida. It is true that there is no consignee specified at Chaguaramas, but what the bill of lading further contemplates is a re-forwarding from that port to the Aluminum. Company of Canada at Arvida, Quebec. The practice of the parties in this shuttle service was sufficiently well established and followed to justify the conclusion that the Aluminum Company of Canada was the consignee at both points and that the goods would be dealt with at Chaguaramas either by that company or by an agent appointed to protect its interests there.\nThe respondent is, in the circumstances of this case, a consignee named in the bill of lading to whom the property passed by reason of such consignment and entitled to \"bring this action within the meaning of the foregoing sec. 2 of the Bills of Lading Act.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nCartwright J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Montgomery, McMichael, Common, Howard, Forsyth and Ker.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Heward, Holden, Hutchison, Cliff, McMaster, Meighen and Hebert.\n1 Q.R.

The respondent, whose head office was in the Parish of Lancaster, Saint John County, contracted to pave among others, a road leading through the Parish of Bathurst, Gloucester County, to Douglastown, Northumberland County, and acquired 59 acres of land in Bathurst Parish on which it erected 38 buildings, including an office, mess hall, sleeping camps, repair shops, an asphalt plant and a gravel-crushing plant. During the winter months moveable equipment was stored at the property and some 20 men employed in repairing it. The Bathurst Parish Assessors purporting to act under the authority of s. 20 assessed the respondent's personal property in the parish at $600,000. On appeal to the County Court Judge the latter reduced the assessment to $275,000 but otherwise confirmed it. On appeal by way of certiorari to the Appeal Division, Supreme Court of New Brunswick, the assessment was set aside on the grounds that the company had no place of business in Bathurst Parish within the meaning of s. 20 of the Act.\nHeld: (Reversing the decision of the New Brunswick Supreme Court, Appeal Division).\n1. That on the facts the assessors could properly find the existence of a business carried on at a \"place\" in the parish of Bathurst within the meaning of s. 20 of The Rates, and Taxes Act.

That only the machinery and other property used for repairing and storing purposes could be taken to be \"connected with or employed in\" the business: what was repaired or stored, was not in that language.\n3. That in making the assessment the assessors proceded upon a wrong principle in whole or in part but a legal and correct assessment could have been made and as provided by s. 126 the matter should be remitted to them for re-assessment on the principles laid down by this Court. The King v. Assessors of Woodstock [1924] S.C.R. 457.\nEstey J. would have allowed the appeal reducing the amount of the assessment to $175.000.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick 1 whereby an appeal from the judgment of His Honour Joseph L. Ryan, Judge of the County Court of Gloucester, was allowed and a rule absolute ordered to quash the assessment by the Assessors of the Parish of Bathurst upon the personal property of the Dexter Construction Co. Ltd.\nC. F. Inches K.C. for the appellants.\nJ. J. F. Winslow K.C. and M. G. Teed K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of Kerwin, Rand, Locke and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nRand J.:\u2014The respondent is a company whose main business is the construction of paved highways. Its head office is at Fairville, New Brunswick, and it is not disputed that its residence in the sense of the locus where its central management and control is exercised, is at that place. During the early part of 1947 the company entered into several contracts with the Government of New Brunswick for reconstructing and paving certain roads in Gloucester County, including one section, about 50 miles in length, of the main highway between Bathurst and Douglastown, in Northumberland County, lying to the south. To enable this and any other work in that district of the province awarded it to be carried out, the company acquired about 59 acres of land in the parish of Bathurst. On this land, part of which seems to have been a gravel pit, 38 buildings were erected in the spring of 1947. They consisted of an office, 23 sleeping camps, kitchen, mess hall, storehouse, oil house, shovel shop, truck shop, machine shop, welding shop, 4 stock buildings and a paint shop. There were set up also on this land, an asphalt plant and a gravel crushing plant. The office was opened not later than in May.\nDuring the following winter the units of moveable equipment used for the road work mentioned as well as other units had been kept in storage and repaired at this station by a staff of 20 men.\nFor the summer operations approximately 200 men were engaged. They included crews for both the asphalt and the gravel crushing plants and the several shops, the truck and machine operators and the general road forces. A superintendent and gang foreman were in immediate charge of the field operations. General instructions would be received from the head office or from an executive field officer. In the office at the Bathurst headquarters three clerks were employed. From slips turned in each night, they made up the employees' time and wages for which they issued weekly cheques drawn on a bank in the City of Saint John. Records were kept of the supplies of food, oil, gas, repair parts and other materials for and used in the several shops and on the road work. The moveable equipment consisted of trucks, tractors, loaders, bulldozers, shovels and graders. There were also spreaders and other units forming part of or used in connection with the asphalt and crushing plants, machines and tools in the shops, and the furniture and equipment of the office.\nThe municipality claims to be entitled to tax that property. The general taxing clause is s. 20 of The Rates and Taxes Act, sub-secs. (1) and (2) of which are as follows:\u2014\n20. (1) All personal property within, or without the Province, owned by an inhabitant of the Province, shall be assessed to the owner in the parish where he resides, subject to the following exceptions:\n(a) Where any person has a shop, factory, office or place of business in a parish other than that in which he resides, or in which shop, factory, office or place of business he carries on his trade, profession, calling, or business, all his personal property connected with or employed in his trade, profession, calling or business so carried on, shall be assessed to him in the parish where he has such shop, factory, office, or place of business:\n(b) Where any person has two or more shops, offices, factories or other places of business situate in different parishes, at which he carries on his trade, profession, calling or business, he shall be assessed in each parish for the portion of his personal property connected with, or employed in the business carried on thereat, * * *\nBy s. 11:\u2014\nFor the purpose of assessment on property or income, every person carrying on business in any parish shall be deemed to be an inhabitant thereof.\n\"Person\" includes any corporation liable to be rated.\nS. 25, ss. (1) provides that personal estate belonging to a joint stock company \"having a place of business within the Province, may be assessed within the parish in which it has a place of business in the name of the corporation, or of the president, manager or agent thereof, * * *; and s.s. (3):\u2014\nStocks or goods or any other personal estate, except shares in ships or shipping, used in any trading or mercantile business including any fur bearing animals kept in captivity for breeding purposes or in connection with the business of fur farming, in any city, town or parish, belonging to any person or persons not resident therein, or to any corporation not having its principal place of business therein, may be assessed in such city, town or parish in the name of the owner or owners of such business or of the agent or manager thereof, in such city, town or parish, and such personal estate shall not be liable to be rated or assessed against the owner or owners thereof in the city, town or parish where he or they reside or in the case of a corporation, in the city, town or parish where such corporation has its principal place of business * * * The language of the statute has been more or less preserved in its earliest form. Intended to meet the usual and simpler modes of \"business\" and reflecting possibly the difficulties in attributing characteristics of personality to corporations, the object of s. 25 is not free from doubt, but for the purposes of this case, the essential requirement under both sections 20 and 25 is that the company should have had a \"place of business\" at which it carried on business within the parish: and the property to be taxed must have been connected with or employed in the business so carried on.\nThe original assessment was on a valuation of $600,000. It was made, apparently, on an estimate little better than a guess that the company had three times as much equipment as that of another company which some workman \"had heard\" was valued around $250,000. An appeal was taken to the County Court Judge who reduced the amount to $275,000 but otherwise confirmed it. Neither the particulars of the reduction nor of the amount confirmed have been given us and we are left in the dark as to the basis on which the judge proceeded.\nThe proceedings were then brought by certiorari before the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court and by a unanimous judgment 2, the entire assessment was set aside on the ground that the facts did not show a business being carried on as required and that there was consequently no jurisdiction to make it. That conclusion was founded upon what were considered to be principles laid down in De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited v. Howe 3, and Kirkwood v. Gadd 4, and the first question is whether the Court has properly interpreted these two judgments.\nBoth of them deal with the rather complicated provisions of The Income Tax Act of the United Kingdom, and it is essential in deducing rules or conceptions from those cases that the intricacies of that law be clearly appreciated. In De Beers the issue was whether a mining company, incorporated in South Africa and carrying on the business of diamond mining there, was subject to income tax in England. In order to be so, it was necessary, under Schedule D to the second section of The Income Tax Act, 1853, that it reside in the United Kingdom, and the question was whether it did or not. Following decisions in Calcutta Jute Mills v. Nicholson 5, and Cesena Sulphur Co. v. Nicholson 6, the House of Lords laid it down that a company is to be deemed to reside where it keeps house and does business, and that it kept house and did business where its central management and control actually was. The majority of directors and life governors of the company lived in England, their meetings were held in London, and they exercised the real control in all the important activities of the company except the actual mining operations. It was found, therefore, as a fact that in London that central management and control did abide. From this it followed that the company resided in England and carried on some part of its business there. As a result, it came under the charge of the rule of Schedule D that rendered it liable to taxation on the whole of its profits. But it was never suggested that the company was not also carrying on business in South Africa; its business extended to both countries. The decision meant simply that for the purposes of income tax in England the company was resident and doing business there of a central managing and controlling character. The language of Lord Loreburn, \"practically all the important business of the company except the mining operations\" implies, obviously, that these operations were themselves part of the \"important business\". But no one questions the fact here that the company through the same degree of control is resident at Fairville; there is no question of residence at all: it is one of doing business at a place of business; and on the authority of De Beers, that business is being conducted both at Fairville and in the parish of Bathurst.\nIn Kirkwood's case, the question was whether, under the Money-Lenders' Act, the money-lender was bound to carry on every detail of his business at his registered address, and it was held that he was not. The language of Lord Atkinson must be interpreted in the light of the controversy which he was considering. The acts which were in question were the negotiation of the detailed terms of the loan and the ascertainment of the items of property by which it was to be secured, and it was pointed out that, in order to carry on the business, some parts of the transactions must necessarily take place elsewhere than at the lender's headquarters. I am unable to see that the decision can, in the slightest way, assist in the construction of the Rates Act.\nThe case of Swedish Central Railway Co. v. Thompson 7 is of some interest in presenting another aspect of the question decided in De Beers. There the company was incorporated under The Companies' Act, 1862 and 1867, with the object of constructing and working a railway in Sweden. The railway had been leased for 50 years at an annual rent. The central control and management of the business originlly in England was later transferred to Sweden, and in that state of things the taxation was claimed. A committee had been appointed to transact formal administrative matters in the United Kingdom, such as the transfer of shares, affixing the seal to certificates, and signing cheques on the London bank account. All dividends were declared in Sweden and the only moneys transmitted to the United Kingdom were for dividends to the shareholders living there. The annual rent was paid to the company in Sweden. It was held, notwithstanding the central direction in Sweden, that there was a sufficient corporate activity in the United Kingdom to establish a residence for the purposes of taxation. The clause of the schedule applied covered the case where, the central management and control of the business not being carried on in whole or part in the United Kingdom, but a residence for limited purposes being there, tax was chargeable on the amount of profits actually received in that country. What was held, in short, was that a company for different categories of tax could have two residences.\nIn Mitchell v. Egyptian Hotels Limited 8, a case of similar facts, Lord Parker, at p. 1037, in the course of his speech, cited the decision of the House in San Paulo v. Carter 9, to the effect that \"a trade or business cannot be said to be wholly carried on abroad if it be under the control and management of persons resident in the United Kingdom, although such persons act wholly through agents and messengers resident abroad. Where the brain which controls the operations from which the profits and gains arise is in this country, the trade or busines is, at any rate partly, carried on in this country.\"\nIt is obvious that in these cases there was no thought that the business in its entirety was being carried on in the United Kingdom, and likewise it cannot be said that because the head office of the company in this appeal is in Fairville, its total business is to be deemed concentrated at that point. Paragraph (b) of 20(1) contemplates any number of shops, offices, factories or other places of business in different parishes which can constitute, ' in many forms, branches of one provincial activity, and in interpreting the legislation the difference between ascertaining the conditions upon which personal property can be taxed by a local administration and those by which a company with a highly ramified organization is to be subject to income tax must be kept in mind.\nWhat s. 20 envisages is a business localized at a place in a parish which attracts to itself certain personal property to which it gives a local habitation: a taxation based on the presence of personal property in a parish other than that of the owner's residence but associated with a place of business. Carrying on a business cannot be intended to include every act of management or related to performance which affects it. A business to be conducted in its entirety within a specific local area can, in these days, embrace only the simplest body of simple transactions. S. 20 clearly extends to businesses that are branch activities of a central organization: and the facts here indicate that the company has other units of plant and other groups of equipment elsewhere in the province. Once a complex of repeated or systematized business operations becomes localized about a place and presents its moveable property in more than a mere unfixed or transient employment in the parish, then the precise period of its presence there becomes of minor importance. One can imagine, for example, a special sale of a bankrupt stock conducted in a parish, say, for three months and in premises rented for that period only. How could it be maintained that that was not a business carried on at a shop or place in the parish? Yet its duration would be only a fraction of what was involved in the facts before us. The situation must be visualized from the standpoint of the community. Here, for well over a year, these operations of preparing roadbed, gathering and treating gravel, making surfacing material and applying it to the roads, storing and repairing the machines used, hiring, paying and discharging workmen, employing truckers with their, vehicles, all under an immediate superintendence centralized at a headquarters, aggregate to what in the ordinary meaning of the words is roadmaking business. The business of the company here lies not in negotiating or making contracts but in performing them: contracts are or may be necessary, no doubt; financing and account books, likewise; but these are formal elements of the operating activities of the company.\nThe question on certiorari is whether on the facts before us the assessors could properly find the existence of a business carried on at a \"place\" in the parish, and in my opinion they could have done so.\nBut a further question arises of the scope of the business so centeredat Bathurst. It was contended that only the work done in the parish could be taken into account: but that misconceives the statute. The business is what is carried on, at, and from, the place of business within the parish; its reaches of operation are not restricted.\nThere is no evidence, however, that the work in Kent County was directed from Bathurst. The main road from Bathurst to Douglastown in Northumberland County I take to have been under that direction. Local time offices are stated to have been kept in both Northumberland and Kent counties but it is not clear whether in the former there was other work than that of the main road or not. The fact that all equipment for the three counties was stored and put into condition at Bathurst during the winter does not annex it, in the sense of the statute, to the business conducted in Bathurst: in that branch of the operations, only the machinery and other property used for repairing and storing purposes could be taken to be \"connected with or employed in\" the business: what is itself repaired or stored is not within that language.\nBut the whole of that property was included in the statement submitted by the officers of the company and included in the assessment. The latter was made, too, certainly in amount, as an entirety: assessed at $600,000 by the assessors and $275,000 by the County Court Judge, it was a single sum for the total property, and not the sum of individually valued items. This was not a case for such a mode of valuation: the items are disparate and should have been severally valued. The amount representing the property used otherwise than for the work carried on from Bathurst cannot therefore be struck out of the assessment; and that it is not of a \"de minimis\" character is clear.\nThe authority for dealing with the appeal on certiorari is s. 126 of The Rates Act, s.s. (b) of which reads:\u2014\nIf the Supreme Court, upon any such hearing, is of opinion that any such assessment is not good in law for the reason that the assessors, in making such assessment, proceeded upon a wrong principle in whole or in part, and that a legal and correct assessment could have been made by such assessors, the Court shall remit the assessment to the assessors, and the assessors shall proceed de novo to make a new assessment in, regard to the particular person or company assessed in and by the assessment so brought before the Court, upon such correct principles as may be set forth or intimated by The Court on the hearing of the matter under the writ of certiorari or the judgment delivered by the court in quashing or finding wrong said assessment, which new assessment shall relate in law to the time when the assessment so quashed or found wrong, in whole or part, was made, and may be dealt with as if made at the time of making the first assessment, and the same shall stand as good at law and in fact, as the said first assessment would have stood and been, had it been legally made, and said second assessment may be enforced to the same extent, and in like manner as the first assessment could have been, had it been according to law.\nThat the assessment proceeded upon a wrong principle \"in whole or part\" but that \"a legal and correct assessment could have been made by\" the assessors follows from the conclusions already expressed. A remission of the assessment to the assessors as authorized by the subsection should, I think, have been directed by the Appeal Division below and is what this Court should now direct. That was the view taken by Duff J. (as he was) in The King Ex Parte Bank of Nova Scotia v. Assessors of Woodstock 10, in which a somewhat similar error was made in assessment principle.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the assessment set aside and returned to the assessors for a re-assessment on the principles laid down. The appellants will have one-half of their costs in this Court and the respondents their costs in the Appeal Division and before the County Court Judge. Estey J.:\u2014The Assessors of the Parish of Bathurst, County of Gloucester in the Province of New Brunswick, imposed, in 1948, a tax upon the real and personal property of the Dexter Construction Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as the Company). These taxes were imposed under the provisions of The Rates and Taxes Act (R.S.N.B. 1927, c. 190). The Company admits liability for the tax upon its real property, but contends that the provisions of the statute do not authorize the parish to impose a tax upon its personal property.\nThe assessment of the personal property at $600,000 by the assessors was reduced by the Judge of the County Court to $275,000. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court held the personal property of the Company was not liable to the imposition of a tax by this parish 11.\nThe Company, contractors with head office at Fairville, Parish of Lancaster in the County of Saint John, constructed roads throughout New Brunswick and, in 1947, was awarded a contract to construct and pave the highway from Bathurst to Douglastown, passing through the Parishes of Bathurst and Allardville in the County of Gloucester, and Alnwick and Newcastle in the County of Northumberland.\nThe Company brought its equipment and facilities for the execution of its work under this contract from either its head office at Fairville or from other parts of the Province where it had carried on construction work. The superintendent, foremen and those directing the work were employees of the Company directed to this work from the head office at Fairville. Many of the workmen were employed locally.\nThe Company, in connection with this work, purchased a parcel of land in the Parish of Bathurst and built thereon a building of portable construction, which included an office and sleeping quarters. It was built \"in 8 ft. wide sections, so they will fit on a flat-bottom truck to take away.\" There were other buildings used for the purposes of a kitchen, mess hall, store house, oil house, shovel shop, truck shop, machine shop, welding shop, paint shop and plant stock. Neither the construction nor the particulars of these buildings were given in detail, but the case has been presented upon the basis that when the work under this contract was executed these buildings would either be removed or no longer used.\nThe Company did purchase some material for the road locally, as well as certain camp supplies. At the camp office tally and weigh sheets of materials and supplies received were kept, as well as the men's time, and the cheques, during the active construction operations, were issued from that office covering the men's time and the payment for the materials and supplies purchased locally. These were apparently the only cheques issued from that office. They were all drawn upon the Company's bank account at Fairville and daily reports were sent to the head office where the books were kept. There was no bank account in the Parish of Bathurst and no cheques were received there. During the winter all cheques were issued from head office.\nThe Company commenced the construction of this highway in 1947. When cold weather came on in November, 1947, it stored and repaired its equipment, during the winter, in the Parish of Bathurst, and about May 20, 1948, resumed the work of constructing the highway.\nThe Rates and Taxes Act (R.S.N.B. 1927, c. 190) is generally \"applicable to all parishes, cities and towns\" in the Province. Under the heading \"Assessment of Personal Property,\" s. 20 provides that, apart from the exceptions there specified, \"All personal property within or without the Province, owned by an inhabitant of the Province, shall be assessed to the owner in the parish where he resides.\" That the Company had both its head office and principal place of business and, therefore, within the view expressed in De Beers Consolidated Mines, Limited v. Howe 12, resided at Fairville, Parish of Lancaster, County of Saint John, within the meaning of s. 20(1) (a), is not disputed.\nThe Parish of Bathurst contends that the personal property comes within the exception of s. 20(1) (a):\n20. (1) All personal property within or without the Province, owned by an inhabitant of the Province, shall be assessed to the owner in the parish where he resides, subject to the following exemptions:\n(a) Where any person has a shop, factory, office or place of business in a parish other than that in which he resides, or in which shop, factory, office or place of business he carries on his trade, profession, calling or business, all his personal property connected with or employed in his trade, profession, calling or business so carried on, shall be assessed to him in the parish where he has such shop, factory, office or place of business;\nThe word \"or\" in this sub-s. (a), where it appears after the word \"resides\" and before the phrase \"in which shop,\" in my opinion should be read \"and.\" It, therefore, follows that not only must the Company have a shop, factory, office or place of business, but it must therein carry on its trade or business, and the personal property, to be taxable, must be connected with, or employed in its trade or business.\nOur attention was directed to a number of cases in which phases similar to \"he carries on his trade * * * or business\" were considered. In San Paulo (Brazilian) Ry. Co. v. Carter 13, and De Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd. v. Howe, supra, the House of Lords held that, as the place from which the direction and control emanated was in England, the Company was carrying on business there and subject to income tax. Even in the San Paulo case Lord Davey stated at p. 43:\nThe business is therefore in very truth carried on, in and from the United Kingdom, although the actual operations of the company are in Brazil, and in that sense the business is also carried on in that country.\nIn Kirkwood v. Gadd 14, it was held that that part of the business of money-lending transacted in a place other than the registered office of the money-lender did not constitute a carrying on of business within the language of the Money-Lenders Act.\nThe Rates and Taxes Act expressly contemplates the taxation of personal property at a place of business other than the head office, the principal place of business or the place from which direction and control emanate and, therefore, the considerations so important in the foregoing cases are not conclusive in determining that other place of business contemplated in s. 20.\nThe foregoing authorities as well as others, and, indeed, the cases decided in Canada, lead to the conclusion that to decide whether or not a company carries on business within the meaning of a particular statute it is first necessary to construe the phrase as used in the particular statute and then to determine, as a question of fact, whether the operation or activity in question comes within the phrase so used and construed.\nThe business of the Company is admittedly the construction of highways. The pertinent issue is, therefore, granting the Company carried on business in the Parish of Lancaster in the County of Saint John, did it also carry on business within the Parish of Bathurst within the meaning of s. 20? S. 20 requires that three essentials be established in order that a tax upon personal property may be imposed. The Company must have a place of business in the parish, at which it carries on its business and in connection with which it uses the personality. If these three essentials be present then it would seem that the Company is carrying on business within the meaning of that section.\nThe evidence discloses, with great respect to those who hold a contrary view, that the Company had a place of business, within the meaning of s. 20, at Bathurst. Permanent records were not kept at Bathurst, but it was there that the men's time was recorded, their wages computed and the cheques issued therefor. It is fair to assume that a labourer would attend at that office to complain of any error in his cheque. The supplies purchased locally were recorded and vendors paid therefor by cheques issued from this place of business. Moreover, in connection with the construction of this highway, it would appear that those at head office, as well as those directing and supervising the work of construction, treated the premises at Bathurst as a place of business. It was the place to which at least those associated with the construction work and the local people went to deal with the Company. There is no question but that a large amount of equipment was used upon the highway and used in connection with the business that was carried on at Bathurst. It, therefore, appears that the three essentials required by s. 20, in order that the tax might be imposed, are here present.\nCounsel for the respondent pressed that, as the direction and control of the business emanated from the head office in Fairville, and once the contract was completed the facilities at Bathurst would be removed or abandoned, that within the meaning of s. 20 it could not be said that the Company carried on business in the Parish of Bathurst. These considerations might well be conclusive under another statute. The Rates and Taxes Act, however, contemplates that personal property may be taxed at a point other than that place from which the direction and control emanate. Moreover, that Act does not make the imposition of the tax contingent upon the existence of a permanent place of business; it rather provides that if the three essentials are present the tax may be imposed. The assessors, in determining the amount of the assessment at $600,000, made no distinction between the personal property connected with, or employed by the Company in its business at Bathurst and that present at Bathurst but used elsewhere. Before the learned County Court Judge the Company made this distinction very clear. Mr. Russell Dexter, with whose evidence the learned Trial Judge was favourably impressed, stated that the cost of all equipment at Bathurst was $546,000, while the cost of that used at Bathurst was $341,255. He admitted that a roller was omitted from this latter item, of which he did not have the cost. It is, however, significant that the cost price of the equipment, as given by the expert Farrell, was $348,000. It is, therefore, a fair conclusion that the roller accounted for the difference. The expert Farrell then deposed that the present worth of that equipment used in connection with the business at Bathurst was $175,554.92.\nThe municipality, before the learned County Court Judge, did not adduce evidence to contradict or vary either that given by Mr. Dexter as to the amount of the equipment used at Bathurst or the valuation of the same as fixed by Mr. Farrell. A suggestion that there may be other equipment that ought to have been included, as used in connection with business at Bathurst, does not, in the circumstances, involve a question of principle, but rather one of additional items and value thereof and, therefore, not a basis for remitting the matter to the assessors.\nThe learned County Court Judge did reduce the assessment to $275,000, but did not indicate the precise basis upon which he did so. The matter was then brought before the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in certiorari proceedings and I have no doubt that had the learned judges of that Court held that the Company was assessable they would, under the provisions of s. 126 (a), have struck from the assessment that part which was not supported by the evidence and directed that the assessment should be in the sum of $175,000, or, under s. 126 (d), would have directed that the amount of the assessment should be $175,000 and that the assessors correct the assessment list to that effect.\nI would, therefore, vary the assessment accordingly and allow the appeal.\nAppeal allowed, assessment set aside and returned for re-assessment. Appellants to have half their costs in this Court, the respondents their costs in the Appeal Division and before the County Court Judge.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Albany J.

The appellant, an. American citizen, operated a public bus service between Boston, U.S.A. and Halifax, Nova Scotia. The New Brunswick Motor Carrier Board, purporting to act under the provisions of The Motor Carrier Act, 1937, c. 43 as amended, granted him a licence to operate his buses over the province's highways connecting the State of Maine with the Province of Nova Scotia but not to embus or debus passengers within New Brunswick. The appellant having refused to be bound by the restriction, an injunction was sought and it was ordered that three questions be raised for the opinion of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal, viz:\n1. Are the operations or proposed operations of the defendant within the Province of New Brunswick or any part or parts thereof prohibited or in any way affected by the provisions of The Motor Carrier Act (1937) and amendments thereto, or orders made by the said Motor Carrier Board?\n2.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014The plaintiff-respondent is a company incorporated under and by virtue of The New Brunswick Companies Act and is in the business (inter alia) of operating motor buses for the carriage of passengers and goods for hire or compensation over the highways of the Province of New Brunswick. It holds licences granted by The Motor Carrier Board of the Province of New Brunswick to operate public motor buses between St. Stephen, New Brunswick, and the City of Saint John, New Brunswick, over Highway Route No. 1 and between the said City of Saint Jahn and the Nova Scotia border over Highway Route No. 2, for the purpose of carrying passengers and goods for hire or compensation. It maintains a daily passenger service over those routes.\nThe appellant, who resides at Lewiston in the State of Maine, one of the United States of America, is in the business (inter alia) of operating motor buses for the carriage of passengers and goods for hire or compensation under the name and style of MacKenzie Coach Lines.\nOn the 17th day of June, 1949, on the application of the appellant, The Motor Carrier Board granted him a licence permitting him to operate public motor buses from Boston in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts through the Prov\u00adince of New Brunswick on Highways Nos. 1 and 2 to Halifax and Glace Bay in the Province of Nova Scotia and return \"but not to embus or debus passengers in the said Province of New Brunswick after August 1, 1949.\"\nAt the time of making the said application, the defendant challenged the validity of the statute of New Brunswick 13 Geo. VI, c. 47 (1949) and The Motor Carrier Act, 1937, as affected thereby, as being ultra vires of the Legislature of the Province of New Brunswick. The Motor Carrier Board made no specific ruling on the defendant's challenge, but acted under the said statute.\nThe appellant, by his motor buses, maintains a regular passenger service over the routes above-mentioned, but, since August 1, 1949, he has continually embussed and debussed passengers within the Province of New Brunswick, and it is his intention to continue to do so unless and until it shall have been declared by some court of com\u00adpetent jurisdiction that such operations are prohibited by The Motor Carrier Act, 1937 and amendments, or by any other applicable statute or law.\nThe appellant further intends to carry passengers not only from points without the Province of New Brunswick but points within the said province, and vice versa, but also in connection with and incidental to. his operations, to carry passengers from points within the said province unless and until it shall have been declared by some court of competent jurisdiction that such operations are pro\u00adhibited by The Motor Carrier Act, 1937 and amendments thereto, or by any other applicable statute or law.\nThe business and undertaking of the appellant consists of the operation of motor buses for the carriage of passen\u00adgers and goods for hire or compensation between the City of Boston in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the Town of Glace Bay in the Province of Nova Scotia and between intermediate points. Such business and undertaking is conducted by the appellant over that portion of its route which lies between the City of Boston and the Town of Calais, Maine, under a certificate granted by Interstate Commerce Commission (a Federal Commission of the United States of America having jurisdiction over inter-state transportation), permitting the appellant to carry passengers and their baggage, as a motor carrier, in. seasonal operations from the 1st day of May to the 15th day of December, both inclusive, over a regular route between Boston, Mass., and a point on the United States-Canada boundary line north of Calais, Maine, and thence over the bridge to the United States-Canada boundary line and return over the same routes; service being author\u00adized to and from all intermediate points.\nSubsequently and in addition, Inter-state Commerce Commission has permitted the appellant to carry passengers and their baggage, as a motor carrier, and express, mail and newspapers in the same vehicle with passengers, in a seasonal operation extending from the 1st of May to the 15th of December, inclusive, of each year, over alternate regular routes for operating convenience only in con\u00adnection with said carrier's presently 'authorized regular route operations. The Motor Carrier Board of the Province of New Bruns-wick, on the 17th of June, 1949, on the application of the appellant, purported to licence the operation of the appel\u00adlant in the Province of New Brunswick as follows:\nIsrael Winner doing business under the name and style of \"MacKenzie Coach Lines\", at Lewiston in the State of Maine is granted a licence to operate public motor buses from Boston in the State of Massachusetts, through the Province of New Brunswick on Highways Nos. 1 and 2, to Halifax and Glace Bay in the Province of Nova Scotia and return, but not to embus or debus passengers in the said Province of New Brunswick after August 1, 1949.\nThe Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities for the Province of Nova Scotia has purported to approve the appellant's operations in the Province of Nova Scotia over routes from the New Brunswick border to Glace Bay, via Route No. 4, Wentworth Valley and Truro; via Route No. 2, Parrsboro and Truro; via Route No. 6, Pugwash, Wallace, Pictou and New Glasgow; and also from Truro to Halifax (three miles of each route is within the corporate limits of the Town of Truro and City of Halifax) ; save that the certificate granted by that Board permitted to suspend operation from January 12, 1949, until May 1, 1949.\nThe appellant, in fact, operates as a public motor carrier between the City of Boston and the Town of Glace Bay and intermediate points, in accordance with a published timetable, copy of which was filed in the record.\nMoreover, between December 15 and May 1 of each year, the appellant proposes to operate as a public motor carrier between the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, connecting with New England Greyhound Lines, Inc., a company authorized by the Inter-State Commerce Com\u00admission to operate as a public motor carrier between Calais, Maine and Boston, Massachusetts.\nIncidental to its operations as aforesaid, the appellant proposes to pick up within the Province of New Brunswick passengers and their baggage having a destination also within the Province of New Brunswick.\nThe respondent brought this action complaining that since August 1, 1949, the appellant has continually embused and debused passengers within the Province of New Brunswick, contrary to his licence, and he has declared his intention of so doing until stopped by legal process; and it was the assertion of the respondent that, unless the appellant was restrained from so doing, irreparable dam-age and harm would be done to the latter. Wherefore the respondent claimed an injunction against the appellant, his servants or agents, restraining him and them from embussing and debussing passengers within New Brunswick, in his public motor buses running between St. Stephen, New Brunswick, and the Nova Scotia border, accompanied by a declaration that the appellant had no legal right to do so, and asking for an accounting of fares received for. the carriage of passengers within the Province of New Brunswick together with damages and costs.\nBy a Statement of Defence, the appellant stated that his operation of public motor buses was primarily inter-national and interprovincial within the meaning of s. 92 (10) (a) of The British North America Act; and he asked for a declaration that his operations were not prohibited by or subject in any way to the provisions of The Motor Carrier Act and amendments thereto, or by or to any other applicable statute or law; and the declaration that 13 Geo. VI, c. 47 (1949) is ultra vires of the Legislature of the Province of New Brunswick.\nThe case having come for hearing before Hughes, J., in the Chancery Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, the learned judge ordered that certain ques\u00adtions of law be raised for the opinion of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick (Appellate Division) and that, in the meantime, all further proceedings in this action be stayed.\nThe questions for the opinion of the Appellate Division were as follows:\n1. Are the operations or proposed operations of the defendant within the Province of New Brunswick, or any part or parts thereof as above set forth, prohibited or in any way affected by the provisions of The Motor Carrier Act, 1937 and amendments thereto, or orders made by the said Motor Carrier Board?\n2. Is 13 George VI, c. 47 (1949) intra vires of the Legislature of the Province of New Brunswick?\nAnd it was further ordered that after the said questions had been answered, then, the matter should be referred back to the Supreme Court Chancery Division for further proceedings, subject to such rights of appeal as may be available to either of the parties, the whole without preju\u00addice to the respondent's right to the relief claimed in its Statement of Claim.\nSubsequently at the hearing before the Court of Appeal another question was added as No. 3:\nAre the proposed operations prohibited or in any way affected by Regulation 13 of The Motor Vehicle Act, c. 20 of the Acts of 1934 and amendments, or under sections 6 or 53 or any other sections of The Motor Vehicle Act?\nThe Attorney General of New Brunswick intervened in the action. After hearing, the Appellate Division answered as follows to the several questions submitted:\nTo Question No. 1: Yes, prohibited, until the Defendant (Appellant) complies with the provisions of the Act.\nTo Question No. 2: Yes, in respect of this Defendant (Appellant), Richards, C.J., Hughes, J., answering simply \"Yes\".\nTo Question No. 3, as it became after the question had been amended by Hughes, J., on the 31st of March, 1950: Yes, until the Defendant (Appellant) complies with the provisions of the Act, and the Regulations made thereunder.\nFrom that decision, the appellant now appeals to this Court.\nRichards, C.J., stated that, in his opinion, the appellant did not come within the exceptions under s. 92 (10) (a) because he had no office or place of business, or organiza\u00adtion, or situs, in the Province of New Brunswick; his office or place of business was at Lewiston, in the State of Maine, and it could not be said, therefore, that his undertaking extended beyond the limits of the province. He then proceeded to consider whether the legislation in question fell within s. 91, or s. 92, of The British North America Act, and, after having referred to a certain number of cases, he came to the conclusion that the legislation in question was entirely local in character, related to traffic within the province, only incidentally affected traffic passing through the province, and, in his view, the legislation was within the competence of the Legislature of New Brunswick.\nHarrison, J., took practically the same view and that, in his opinion, the defendant's undertaking did not come under s. 92 (10) (a). To his mind, the province had the right to regulate motor vehicle traffic within its own borders and that included the right to prohibit such traffic when deemed necessary or expedient. However, he further added that, even if the Acts in question should be held ultra vires in respect of a Canadian national carrying on an undertaking locally in Canada for transporting passengers and goods between provinces, it did not follow that the appellant could raise the same defence. The appellant, being a foreign national, was bound to comply with the laws regulating vehicular traffic within the provinces' boundaries, until they were super\u00adseded by Dominion legislation; and foreign nationals, insofar as they were concerned, had no status to ask that such laws be declared ultra vires.\nHughes, J., sitting as a member of the Appellate Division, concurred in the answers given by Richards, C.J.\nIt is to be noted that this is an ordinary case and not a reference.\nQuestions of law were submitted to the Appellate Division for the purpose of securing its opinion, after which, as stated in the Order of Hughes, J. itself, the matter was to be referred back to the Supreme Court Chancery Division for further proceedings and with the object of enabling the trial judge to decide the case.\nUnder no interpretation of the procedure to be followed could the case be transformed into a reference, which, alone, the Legislature of New Brunswick had the power and the authority to submit to the Courts. The decision on the questions of law was useful only to the extent that it could be used for the purpose of deciding the case as, otherwise, the questions were quite unnecessary.\nThe conclusions of the plaintiff-respondent in its Statement of Claim were merely that an injunction should issue against the defendant-appellant, his servants or agents, restraining him and them from embussing and debussing passengers within the Province of New Brunswick in his public motor buses running between St. Stephen, New Brunswick, and the Nova Scotia border, and a declaration that the defendant-appellant had no legal right to embus or debus passengers within the Province of New Brunswick, with a consequential demand for an accounting, and dam-ages. That is all that the plaintiff-respondent asked for and all that he can get in the present case. The basis of that claim is evidently the so-called licence issued to the appellant on the 17th of June, 1949, by The Motor Carrier Board of the Province of New Brunswick, which has been already reproduced above.\nOne would look in vain to any of the provisions of The ' Motor Carrier Act, 1937, and its amendments, or to the Statute 13 Geo. VI, c. 47 (1949), of New Brunswick, or to Regulation 13 of The Motor Vehicle Act, c. 20, of the Acts of 1934 and amendments, or to sections 6 or 53, or any other sections of The Motor Vehicle Act, for any prohibition affecting the appellant, \"restraining him from embussing and debussing passengers within the Province of New Brunswick in his public motor buses running between St. Stephen, New Brunswick, and the Nova Scotia border\" (to use the very words of the conclusions of the respondent), or for anything affecting \"his legal right to embus or debus passengers within the Province of New Brunswick\" (also a conclusion of the respondent's Statement of Claim). When once it is granted that the appellant holds, as he does, a licence to operate his motor buses through the Province of New Brunswick, on High-ways Nos. 1 and 2, to Halifax and Glace Bay, in the Province of Nova Scotia and return, nothing can be found in either The Motor Vehicle Act or The Motor Carrier Act, 1937, restraining him from embussing or debussing passengers in the province.\nIndeed, what the plaintiff-respondent wishes the Courts to enjoin is based and can find any foundation only on the qualification inserted in the appellant's licence by The Motor Carrier Board.\nIf, therefore, such qualification is illegal and, in fact, ultra vires, because it is not authorized by the two Acts themselves, it follows that it must disappear from the licence and there is nothing left on which the action of the respondent can be maintained.\nFor the authority of The Motor Carrier Board to insert such a qualification in the licence of the appellant, one must look, of course, to An Act Respecting Motor Carriers (c. 43, Acts of Assembly, 1 Geo. VI (1937), passed April 2, 1937), whereby the Board was constituted. By that Act, the Board is given the power to grant to any person, firm or company, a licence to operate or cause to be operated, within the province, public motor buses or public motor trucks over specified routes and between specified points.\nSection 5(3) of the Act specifies that:\nIn determining whether or not a licence shall be granted, the Board shall give consideration to the transportation service being furnished by any railroad, street railway, or licensed motor carrier, the likelihood of proposed service being permanent and continuous throughout the period of the year that the highways are open to travel and the effect that such proposed service may have upon other transportation services.\nAnd section 5(4) adds:\nIf the Board finds from the evidence submitted that public con\u00advenience will be promoted by the establishment of the proposed service, or any part thereof, and is satisfied that the applicant will provide a proper service, an order may be made by the Board that a licence be granted to the applicant in accordance with its finding upon proper security being furnished.\nSection 11 should also be referred to. It reads thus:\nExcept as provided by this Act, no person, firm or company shall operate a public motor bus or public motor truck within the Province without holding a licence from the Board authorizing such operations and then only as specified in such licence and subject to this Act and its Regulations.\nThe three sections just quoted are the only ones to which the Court was referred as affording authority to The Motor Carrier Board to insert in the appellant's licence the restriction therein mentioned.\nMoreover, s. 22 of An Act Respecting Motor Carriers states that \"the provisions of this Act shall be deemed to be in addition to the provisions of The Motor Vehicle Act\". By force of the regulations made under authority of The Motor Vehicle Act \"no person operating a motor vehicle as a public carrier between fixed termini outside the Province shall operate such motor vehicle on the highways of the Province unless the operator is in possession of a permit issued by the Department setting forth the con\u00additions under which such motor vehicle may operate and after payment of such fees as the Minister may determine fair and equitable\" (Regulation No. 13). And that is the regulation specially mentioned in Question No. 3 submitted to the Appellate Division. It would seem, of course, that, if Regulation 13 governs the operations of the appellant-and no reason was advanced why it should not-the permit which is to be issued to the appellant \"setting forth the conditions under which such motor vehicle may operate\" is the permit mentioned in that Regulation 13. If it were not so, one would speculate as to the reason for referring to that regulation in the questions submitted.\nIt cannot be that, if the permit which the operator of a motor vehicle, as a public carrier, must secure in order to operate such a motor vehicle on the highways of the province, is to be issued by the Department and to set forth the conditions under which such motor vehicle may operate after payment of such fees as the Minister may determine fair and equitable, the intention of the Legis\u00adlature would be that, by application of The Motor Carrier Act, the Board would have anything to do with that permit. The two Acts, as enacted in s. 22 of The Motor Carrier Act, must be interpreted together and it stands to reason that the Legislature cannot have had in view that the Board may set forth conditions which the Department has not decreed.\nBut, moreover, Regulation 13 of The Motor Vehicle Act comes under the title of \"Non-Residents\" and it specifically provides for a person operating a motor vehicle, as a public carrier, between fixed termini outside the province, who intends to operate such motor vehicles on the highways of the province. It says that, in such a case, the permit must be issued by the Department and that it is in that permit that the conditions under which such motor vehicle may operate are to be set forth. On the other hand, s. 4 of An Act Respecting Motor Carriers only deals with the power of the Board to grant to any person, firm or company, a licence to operate or cause to be operated within the province public motor buses or public motor trucks.\nWhichever way the two sections are contrasted, it does not leave any room for doubt that, in the case of a non-resident, Regulation No. 13 must prevail, as it is a special enactment referring, in terms, to non-residence, while the other s. 4 of The Motor Carrier Act is a general provision, in terms, dealing with persons, firms or companies operating only within the province.\nOn the record as it stands, it is to be assumed (as no reference whatever is made to it), that the appellant has complied with Regulation No. 13, or, at all events, it must be decided that, if the appellant needs a permit, it is to be issued to him under Regulation No. 13 of The Motor Vehicle Act and that he has nothing to do with the licence provided for by s. 4 of The Motor Carrier Act. Indeed, it was not in any way within the competency of the Board to issue to him, a non-resident, a permit or licence under s. 4.\nThe consequence is that the licence upon which the plaintiff-respondent relied to ask the Court to issue an injunction against the appellant, restraining him from embussing and debussing passengers, was issued wholly without a shadow of authority.\nBut there is yet another objection to the validity of the licence issued to the appellant, and it is this: That the restriction inserted by the Board in the licence which it issued has nothing to do with highway legislation proper. It does not deal with schedules, or service, or rates, or fares, or charges, or forms, or fees, as provided for in s. 17(1) of The Motor Carrier Act; it does not deal in any way with highways in stipulating that the appellant will not be entitled to embus or debus his passengers within the territory of New Brunswick; it is nothing more than an attempt to regulate or control the business of the appellant.\nThe object of such a restriction has not been explained, nor is it apparent. It was suggested by counsel for the respondent himself that it had in view the prevention of competition by the appellant against the respondent. If so, of course, it is not highway legislation but something which may come under the heading of \"Commerce\" (and, in the present case, of commerce by an international under-taking), but it has surely nothing to do with traffic. As was suggested, if necessary, it would be quite possible for the appellant to own, along the lines of his motor buses, certain vacant property where his passengers could embus or debus. Yet, the restriction inserted in his licence would prohibit this.\nIt was argued that, if the Board really had competency to issue a licence to the appellant, notwithstanding the terms of Regulation 13 under The Motor Vehicle Act, it could find some authority for what it has done in somewhat general terms in s. 5(3) or 11 of The Motor Carrier Act; but that argument forgets altogether the rules of interpre\u00adtation of statutes-that words must be understood in accord with the subject matter of the statute.\nAs put by Maxwell, on Interpretation of Statutes, 9th Ed., by Sir Gilbert Jackson, at page 55, the words of a statute are to 'be understood in the sense in which they harmonize with the subject of the enactment and the object which the legislature has in view:\nTheir meaning is found not so much in a strictly grammatical or etymological propriety of language, nor even in its popular use, as in the subject or in the occasion on which they are used, and the object to be attained. It is not because the words of a statute, or the words of any document, read in one sense will cover the case, that that is the right sense. Grammatically, they may cover it; but, whenever a statute or document is to be construed, it must be construed not according to the mere ordinary general meaning of the words, but according to the ordinary meaning of the words as applied to the subject-matter with regard to which they are used, unless there is something which renders it necessary to read them in. a sense which is not their ordinary sense in the English language as so applied (Brett M.R., Lion Insurance Co. v. Tucker (1883), 53 L.J.Q.B. 189.\nAnd, at Page 63, the following occurs:\nWORDS IN ACCORD WITH INTENTION\nIt is in the interpretation of general words and phrases that the principle of strictly adapting the meaning to the particular subject-matter with referencec [sic] to which the words are used finds its most frequent application. However wide in the abstract, they are more or less elastic, and admit of restriction or expansion to suit the subject-matter. While expressing truly enough all that the Legislature intended, they frequently express more, in their literal meaning and natural force; and it is necessary to give them the meaning which best suits the scope and object of the statute without extending to ground foreign to the intention. It is, therefore, a canon of interpretation that all words, if they be general and not express and precise, are to be restricted to the fitness of the matter. They are to be construed as particular if the intention be par\u00adticular; that is, they must be understood as used with reference to the Subject-matter in the mind of the Legislature, and limited to it.\nIn the present case, however wide may be the general terms implied in s. 3(3), 5(4) or 11, they must be read as being restricted to the subject of highway circulation and cannot be extended to the subject of commercial competi\u00adtion or some other similar objects.\nUnder such a rule of interpretation, it is not possible to say that the restriction inserted by the Board, in the appellant's licence, was justified by the terms of The Motor Carrier Act and it must, therefore, be considered as ultra vires. For those two reasons, both because the permit required by the appellant was within the jurisdiction of the Department and of the Minister and did not come under the competency of the Motor Carrier Board, and also because, even if it did, that Board exceeded its authority and dealt with a matter with which it was in no way concerned, we must come to the conclusion that the licence issued by the Board to the appellant is invalid.\nThat being so, it disposes of the plaintiff-respondent's action and claim and, with due respect, I find all the other questions irrelevant.\nTo the questions submitted by the learned trial judge, I would therefore answer:\n1. The operations or proposed operations of the defendant-appellant, within the Province of New Brunswick or any part or parts thereof, as above set forth, are not prohibited or in any way affected by the pro-visions of The Motor Carrier Act, 1937, and amendments thereto. On the contrary, such operations or proposed operations are specially provided for in Regulation 13 made under authority of The Motor Vehicle Act. The attempt to restrict them in the order made by the Motor Carrier Board is illegal and ultra vires.\nAs the only foundation for the plaintiff-respondent's action is this illegal restriction and, indeed, the complete lack of authority in the Motor Carrier Board to issue the licence at all is sufficient, to decide the present case between the parties, it becomes immaterial to pass upon the validity of the two acts of the Legislature of New Brunswick.\nAs I said, the object of submitting these legal questions to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick being limited to the purpose of deciding the case, it is therefore sufficient for that purpose to come to the conclusion that the licence can in no way support the conclusions of the Statement of Claim and it is unnecessary to go further.\nConsequently, I decline to answer the second and third questions. The Statute 13 Geo. VI, c. 47 (1949), referred to in Question No. 2 does appear to me to be intra vires, for I fail to see how the amendment to section 4 of the said chapter, as amended by c. 37 of 3 Geo. VI, (1939), intro\u00adduced by 13 Geo. VI (1949), c. 47, can have any bearing on the case. The amendment in question consisted merely in striking out the word \"and\" in the fourth line thereof and substituting therefor the word \"or\", and in striking out the words \"within the province\", being the last three words of the said section.\nThe result of that amendment is, therefore, that s. 4 thereafter read:\nThe Board may grant to any person, firm or company, a licence to operate or cause to be operated public motor buses or public motor trucks over specified routes and between specified points.\nAs originally enacted by The Motor Carrier Act, 1987, s. 4 read (without repeating the whole of it) :\n* * * a licence to operate or cause to be operated within the province public motor buses * * *\nBy the amendment of c. 37, 3 Geo. VI, (1939), the words \"within the Province\" were struck out, where they origin-ally stood, and were added at the end of the section, so that it afterwards read:\nThe Board may grant to any person, firm or company a licence to operate or 'cause to be operated public motor buses or public motor trucks over specified routes and between specified points within the province.\nThe effect of the amendment by c. 47 of 13 Geo. VI (1949), was that the words \"within the Province\", being the last three words of the said section, were struck out.\nI must confess that I do not see the difference, for, in my opinion, the section, as amended, has exactly the same effect as it had before. Notwithstanding the deletion of the words \"within the Province\", at the end of the section, the latter continues to be susceptible of meaning and appli\u00adcation only to the operations within the province, and the Courts would be extremely loath to give it any other meaning, for the legislation adopted by the Legislature of New Brunswick must necessarily be understood to be limited to the territory of New Brunswick, as that Legis\u00adlature could not possibly be considered as having attempted to legislate upon operations outside the province.\nAs for Question No. 3:\nAre the proposed operations prohibited or in any way affected by Regulation 13 of The Motor Vehicle Act, Chapter 20 of the Acts of 1934 and amendments, or under Sections 6 or 53 or any other sections of The Motor Vehicle Act?\nI have already expressed my opinion that none of these sections prohibits the appellant's operation in New Brunswick. On the contrary, they provide for the manner in which these operations may be carried out in that province. Indeed, s. 7(2) specifies that a foreign vehicle which has been registered theretofore outside of the province need only \"exhibit to the Department the Certificate of Title or Registration, or other evidence of such former registra\u00adtion as may be in the applicant's possession or control or such other evidence as will satisfy the Department that the applicant is the lawful owner of the vehicle\". It follows, by necessary implication, that this requirement will be held sufficient and that the foreign motor vehicle will then obtain the necessary registration to operate upon any highway in New Brunswick, as provided for by s. 6 (1).\nSection 53 goes no further than to say that \"no motor vehicle shall be used or operated upon a highway unless the owner shall have complied in all respects with the requirements of this Act\". Of course, it adds that no opera\u00adtion can be carried on \"where such highway has been closed to motor traffic under the provisions of the Highway Act\", which is not only proper but natural.\nThen, Regulation 13, as we have seen, specifies that \"No person operating a motor vehicle, as a public carrier, between fixed termini outside the Province shall operate such motor vehicle on the highways of the Province unless the operator is in possession of a permit issued by the Department setting forth the conditions under which such motor vehicle may operate and after payment of such fees as the Minister may determine fair and equitable\". This, of course, is not prohibition. It is only regulation which assumes that, provided the conditions set forth in Regula\u00adtion 13 are complied with by the appellant, he will receive the permit to operate on the highways of New Brunswick. To that extent, of course, the proposed operations of the appellant are affected; and that is, in fact, the effect of the answer given by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick that all that the appellant has to do is to comply with the provisions of The Motor Vehicle Act and the Regulations made thereunder, and, after he has done so, he may operate on the highways of New Brunswick.\nAll that the appellant had to do, if he has not done so already (and it was assumed at Bar that he had complied with it), is to apply to the Department for a permit which will set forth the conditions under which his motor vehicles may operate and pay such fees as the Minister may deter-mine fair and equitable. But, as I have mentioned before, when once he has that permit, or if he has it already, such permits issued by the Department with the approval of the Minister does away entirely with the obligation of getting a licence from the Motor Carrier Board under s. 4 of The Motor Carrier Act, 1937. Regulation 13 under The Motor Vehicle Act applies specifically to foreign owners who are already registered in their own province or country, while s. 4 of The Motor Carrier Act is a general enactment which does not concern the foreign owners. It is quite clear that a vehicle owned by a non-resident, so far as the obligation to obtain a licence is concerned, is par\u00adticularly dealt with in The Motor Vehicle Act, more especially Regulations 8, 9 and 13 under that Act, and not by The Motor Carrier Act.\nAll that we have to do on the present appeal is to give our answers to the questions submitted by the trial judge to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick and then, after the questions have been answered, to refer the matter back to the Supreme Court Chancery Division for further proceedings, presumably so that the trial judge shall deal with the case in accordance with those answers.\nIn the Appellate Division the Court ordered that the plaintiff-respondent should have the costs of its application. As the present answers are contrary to those that were given in the Appellate Division and as they are in favour of the defendant-appellant, I presume that, on the present appeal, it should be said that the appellant shall have his costs both in this Court and in the Appellate Division.\nThe result of my judgment is that it is unnecessary to pass upon the interventions .of the Attorney General of Canada, of the Attorneys General of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Prince Edward Island and British Columbia, as well as those of the Canadian National Railway Company, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, the Maccam Transport Limited and the Carwill Transport Limited. They were interested only in the ques\u00adtion of the constitutionality of the New Brunswick Acts. As it happens, in my respectful view, the Court is not called upon to decide that question, in order to dispose of the present litigation; and it is well within the usual practice of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to avoid deciding any other question than that which is necessary to settle the difficulty between the parties. (To support that practice, it is sufficient to refer to the judg\u00adment of the Judicial Committee in Regent Taxi and Trans-port Co. v. La Congr\u00e9gation des Petits Fr\u00e8res de Marie[2].\nThe result would show that, unfortunately, all these intervenants were mobilized to no purpose, except perhaps that this Court has been privileged in listening to very interesting arguments on the question of the constitution\u00adality of a province adopting legislation such as is con\u00adtained in The Motor Vehicle At and The Motor Carrier Act of New Brunswick. It is, of course, a satisfaction that this Court should be relieved of the obligation to decide such a moot question. We should not suppose that the intervenants expected to be granted costs in this matter. They were appearing merely to defend their respective constitutional rights and in. those cases it is usual not to grant costs to the intervenants.\nOf course, in view of the result, neither the appellant nor the respondent could legitimately obtain an order for costs against either of the intervenants. That also disposes of the motion of the respondent praying that this Court should review its former decision that there should be no costs either for or against the railway companies of their intervention. The motion will, therefore, stand dismissed without costs.\nKERWIN J.:\u2011This is an appeal by Israel Winner, doing business under the name and style of MacKenzie Coach Lines, against a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in respect of certain questions of law propounded for its opinion before trial by an order of Hughes J. The action was brought by S.M.T. (Eastern) Limited for an injunction restraining Winner from picking up and letting down passengers within New Brunswick in his motor buses running between points in the United States and the Province of Nova Scotia over routes in New Brunswick between St. Stephen and the Nova Scotia border, and also for other relief.\nSubsequent to the order of Hughes J., the Attorney General of New Brunswick intervened. The Appellate Division answered the questions in favour of the plaintiff respondent but granted leave to the defendant to appeal to this Court. Pursuant to orders made by this Court or a judge thereof, the Attorney General of Canada, the Attor\u00adneys General of several of the provinces, Canadian Na\u00adtional Railway Company and Canadian Pacific Railway Company, and two transport companies, intervened and were represented on the argument. On the opening thereof, in order to obviate certain difficulties that might otherwise arise, it was arranged that, with the consent of the Attorney General of New Brunswick, he ex rel the plaintiff company, should be added as a party plaintiff nunc pro tune by order of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and that has been done.\nBy agreement of counsel made prior to the hearing before the Appellate Division, the questions for considera\u00adtion were enlarged. No evidence was given but the matter has been argued on an agreed statement of facts contained in the order of Hughes J. and from this statement the circumstances giving rise to the questions may be sum\u00admarized as follows.\nThe appellant, Winner, resides in the State of Maine in the United States of America and operates his coach lines for the carriage of passengers and goods for hire or compensation between Boston, Massachusetts, and Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, and intermediate points. So far as his business and undertaking in the United States are con\u00adcerned, he operatesn under certificates granted by the Interstate Commerce Commission (a federal commission of the United States). So far as the Province of New Brunswick is concerned, he holds himself out as a carrier of passengers and goods (a) from outside the province to points along his route in the province; (b) from points within the province to points outside the province; and (c) between points in the province when such carriage is incidental to his international or interprovincial operations. In view of the argument before us, I take (c) to mean not only that he will carry passengers and goods between points in the province as an incident to stop-over privileges in connection with the through passage from points outside to those within the province and from points inside to those outside the province, but also that he will carry all passengers and goods between those points. He applied to the Motor Carrier Board of New Brunswick for a licence to operate public motor buses from St. Stephen, New Brunswick, through New Brunswick to the Nova Scotia border, which licence was granted but on a condition the validity of which he challenges, viz., that he was not to embus or debus passengers in New Brunswick. In fact he operates his bus line so as to attract and carry out the carriage of passengers described in (a), (b) and (c) and proposes to continue doing so unless halted by judicial process.\nThe plaintiff company is incorporated under and by virtue of the New Brunswick Companies' Act and is in the business (inter alia) of operating motor buses for the carriage of passengers and goods for hire or compensation over the highways of the Province of New Brunswick. It holds licences granted by the Motor Carrier Board to operate public motor buses between St. Stephen and Saint John, New Brunswick, over highway route No. 1 and between Saint John and the Nova Scotia border over high-way route No. 2 for the purposes of carrying passengers and goods for hire or compensation. Routes 1 and 2 are the ones used by Winner.\nAs amended, the questions submitted for the opinion of the Appellate Division are as follows:\u2011\n1. Are the operations or proposed operations of the defendant within the Province of New Brunswick or any part or parts thereof as above set forth prohibited or in any way affected by the provisions of The Motor Carrier Act, 1937, and amendments thereto or orders made by the said Motor Carrier Board?\n2. Is 13 Geo. VI, c. 47 (1949) intra vires of the legislature of the Province of New Brunswick?\n3. Are the proposed operations prohibited or in any way affected by Regulation 13 of The Motor Vehicle Act, c. 20 of the Acts of 1934 and amendments, or under sections 6 or 53 or any other sections of The Motor Vehicle Act? In my view it is unnecessary to detail the provisions of The Motor Carrier Act or The Motor Vehicle Act since, if the relevant provisions of these Acts are validly enacted and are applicable to Winner, they authorize what has been done by the Board in affixing the condition to the licence granted him. The important matter is whether the Legislature of New Brunswick is competent so to authorize the Board so far as Winner is concerned.\nPrior to 1904, the title to the soil and freehold of high-ways in New Brunswick was vested in the owners of lands abutting on the highways. That year, by 4 Ed. VII, c. 6, s. 4, the soil and freehold were vested in His Majesty. This enactment was repealed in 1908 and, by R.S.N.B. 1927, c. 25, s. 29, His Majesty released any right he might have under the 1904 Act, and the title to the soil and freehold was re-vested in the abutting owners. In my opinion the same ultimate result would follow in provinces where the title is in the Crown. In either case, I take it to be indis\u00adputable that highways, generally speaking, fall within \"Property and 'Civil Rights in the Province\" under s. 92 head 13 of the British North America Act. The public right of passage over highways is in all the members of the public, whether residents of the particular province or any other, or of a foreign country, and subsists whether the fee is in the Crown or abutting owners. That right may be interfered with in some respects by provincical legislatures and no question is raised as to its power to require every public motor carrier to register provincially and carry pro\u00advincial licence plates. No claim is made to differentiate between residents of New Brunswick on the one hand and, on the other, residents of other provinces, or aliens. So far as residents of the Dominion outside New Brunswick are concerned, it appears inadvisable to pass any comment on the opinion expressed by two members of this Court in Accurate News and Information Act Reference[3]. Now, as then, I find it unnecessary to deal with the matter. It is also unnecessary to express any view as to aliens but, when that time does arrive, the decisions of the Judicial Committee in Cunningham v. Tomey Homma[4] and Brooks-Bidlake and Whitall Ltd. v. A.G. for B.C.[5], will require consideration. The claim of the appellant, the Attorney General of Canada, and the Railways, is founded upon the exclusive power of Parliament to legislate in relation to \"Works and Undertakings connecting the Province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of the province.\" It is, of course, settled that the effect of this and other exceptions in. head 10 of section 92 of the British North America Act is to transfer the excepted works and undertakings to section 91 and thus to place them under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of Parliament in accordance with the final clause of section 91:\u2011\nAnd the matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumer\u00adated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nMontreal v. Montreal Street Railway[6]. Contrary to what had been alleged to be the effect of this decision, it was held by the Judicial Committee in Re Regulation and Control of Radio Communication in Canada[7] that \" 'Undertaking' is not a physical thing but is an arrangement under which, of course, physical things are used.\"\nFor the respondent and those supporting it, it was argued that if it cannot be said Winner had a work and undertaking connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces or extending beyond the limits of the province, he could not possibly come within the exception. This contention in my opinion is not sound and, where necessary, \"and\" must be read \"or\". That, I think, follows from the decision in the Radio case but, if not, it should now be so declared. Another argument, which was given effect to in the Appellate Division, was that since Winner is a resident of the United States of America he could have no local work or undertaking in New Brunswick and that, therefore, his organization could not be a work or undertaking con\u00adnecting the province with any other or others of the provinces or extending beyond the limits of the province within 92(10) (a). Emphasis is placed upon \"Local\" and \"such\" in the opening words of head 10, \"Local Works and Undertakings other than such as are of the following classes\", and it is said that the connecting or extending works or undertakings later mentioned in (a) must be such as have their genesis in the province. In my opinion there is nothing to indicate that the primary location must be so situate.\nThe latest expression of opinion upon head 10 of section 92 appears in the decision of the Judicial Committee in the Empress Hotel case, C.P.R. v. A.G. for B.C.[8], where it is stated at 142:-\"The latter part of the paragraph (10(a)) makes it clear that the object of the paragraph is to deal with means of interprovincial communication. Such com\u00admunication can be provided by organizations or under-takings, but not by inanimate things alone.\" Whether at some time in the future, under circumstances not now envisaged, \"undertaking\" will be restricted to means of communication need not concern us at present since it is patent that the term includes the business or organization of the appellant.\nThe appellant holds himself out as well in New Brunswick as in Nova Scotia and the United States as a carrier of passengers and goods interprovincially, internationally, and intraprovincially. Arguments of convenience and ex\u00adpediency may be advanced to indicate either that regula\u00adtion by a province of such things as rates and stopping places for people desiring to travel from one point in New Brunswick to another on through buses would not inter\u00adfere with the regulation by the Dominion of rates and stopping places for through traffic; or, on the other hand, that it would be inconvenient-for instance, for a through bus to stop for a passenger and the driver to, find after proceeding some distance that the passenger desired merely to go to another point in New Brunswick.\nHowever, it is sufficient to state that in my opinion the interprovincial and international undertaking of the appel\u00adlant falls clearly within section 92(10) (a) of the British North America Act but that the carriage of passengers or goods between points (a) and (b) in New Brunswick is not necessarily incidental to the appellant's undertaking connecting New Brunswick with any other, or others, of the provinces or extending beyond the limits of the province, except as to such carriage in connection with stop-over privileges extended as an incident of the contract of through carriage.\nThe questions put are very broad as they refer; to the provisions of The Motor Carrier Act, 1,937 and amendments thereto; to orders made by the Motor Carrier Board; to \"sections 6 or 53 or any other sections of The Motor Vehicle Act\", c. 20 of the statutes of 1934 and amendments; and to Regulation 13 issued under the latter Act. Further-more, the questions as settled by Hughes J. were added to merely on the consent of counsel. That is really attempting to do what only the Governor General in Council or Lieutenant Governor in Council are authorized to do. It is inadvisable in such a proceeding as this to attempt to deal with all the provisions of either Act or orders or regulations made thereunder, and in fact many of them were not even referred to in argument.\nThe questions should be answered by stating that the New Brunswick Statutes and Regulations in question and the licence issued by the Motor Carrier Board to the appellant are legally ineffective to prohibit the appellant by his undertaking from bringing passengers into the province from outside the province and landing such passengers in the province, or from carrying passengers from any point in the province to a point outside the limits thereof. They are also ineffective to prohibit the transportation of passengers between points in the province, to which passengers stop-over privileges have been extended as an incident of a contract of carriage.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the order of the Appeal Division set aside, and the questions answered as above. The appellant is entitled as against the respondent, S.M.T. (Eastern) Limited, to his costs of the hearing before the Appeal Division and to two-thirds of his costs of the appeal to this Court. The motion by the appellant to vary the terms of the order of this Court granting leave to Canadian National Railway Company and Canadian Pacific Railway Company to intervene was abandoned and it will, therefore, stand dismissed without costs. There will be no costs of other motions to add any intervenant. There will be no costs for or against the Attorney-General of New Brunswick or any intervenant. TASCHEREAU J.:\u2011In his action the plaintiff-respondent claims that the defendant has no legal right to embus or debus passengers within the Province of New Brunswick, and prays for an injunction to restrain him from doing so.\nThe defendant, who resides at Lewiston, Maine, is in the business of operating motor buses for the carriage of passengers and goods. On the 17th of June, 1949, The Motor Carrier Board granted him a licence permitting him to operate public motor buses from Boston, Mass. through the Province of New Brunswick, on highways Nos. 1 and 2 to Halifax and Glace Bay, in the Province of Nova Scotia, and return, but not to embus or debus passengers in the said Province of New Brunswick after August 1, 1949. It is his contention in his statement of defence and counter-claim, that his operation of buses is primarily international and interprovincial, and that incidentally he may therefore embus and debus passengers within the Province of New Brunswick, and also carry passengers from points within the Province to destinations also within the province. He claims that his operations constitute an \"undertaking\" connecting the Province of New Brunswick with another Province of Canada, and extending into the United States of America, within the meaning of s. 92(10) (a) of the British North America Act. He asks for a declaration that his operations are not prohibited by or subject in any way to the provisions of The Motor Carrier Act, and that 13 Geo. VI, c. 47 (1949) under which the definitions of \"public motor bus\" and \"public motor truck\" were altered to include interprovincial and international motor carriage, be declared ultra vires of the Legislature of the Province of New Brunswick.\nPursuant to the Rules of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Mr. Justice Hughes of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick before whom the matter came, ordered, on the 17th of January, 1950, that certain questions of law should be referred to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appellate Division, prior to the trial of the action. The questions submitted for the opinion of the Court of Appeal were the following:\n1. Are the operations or proposed operations of the defendant within the Province of New Brunswick, or any part or parts thereof as above set forth, prohibited or in any way affected by the provisions of The Motor Carrier Act (1937) and amendments thereto, or orders made by the said Motor Carrier Board? 2. Is 13 Geo. VI c. 47 (1949) intra vires of the legislature of the Province of New Brunswick?\nAnd on the 21st day of March, 1950, the submission to the Appellate Division was enlarged, and the following question was added:\nAre the proposed operations prohibited or in any way affected by Regulation 13 of The Motor Vehicle Act, a 20 of the Acts of 1934 and amendments, or under sections 6 or 53 or any other sections of The Motor Vehicle Act?\nThe Court of Appeal, on the 1st of May, 1950, gave the following answers:\n1. \"Yes, prohibited, until the defendant complies with the provisions of the Act.\"\n2. \"Yes, in respect of this defendant.\" (Messrs. Richards, and Hughes, J. answering simply \"Yes\".)\n3. \"Yes, until the defendant complies with the provisions of the Act and the regulations made thereunder.\"\nThe main question to be decided is the interpretation of subsection 10 of section 92 of the B.N.A. Act, which reads as follows:\n92. In each Province the Legislature may exclusively make Iaws in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated; that is to say,\u2011\n10. Local Works and Undertakings other than such as are of the following classes:\u2011\n(a) Lines of steam or other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs, and other works and undertakings connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of the province:\n(b) Lines of steam ships between the province and any British or foreign country:\n(c) Such works as, although wholly situate within the province, are before or after their execution declared by the parliament of Canada to be for the general advantage of Canada or for the advantage of two or more of the provinces.\nIt is beyond dispute, that the operations of the appellant are an \"undertaking\" within the meaning of the section. As Lord Dunedin expressed it in the Radio Reference[9], they constituted \"an arrangement, under which physical things were used\". I cannot agree with the proposition that the appellant's \"undertaking\" does not come within subsection (10) of section 92. It is argued that the \"works and undertakings\" excluded from the provincial jurisdic\u00adtion, are those which connect the province with any other, or extend beyond the limits of the province, and are \"local\" which means within the Province of New Brunswick. As the appellant has no office or location of any kind in New Brunswick, it would follow that it is not \"local\". It is my opinion that it is not necessary, in order to fall within the scope of the section, that the \"undertaking\" have its \"origin and situs within the province\", and that the appel\u00adlant should have an office or place of business therein. It is I think sufficient to bring the matter within federal jurisdiction, that the bus line operates as it does in the present case, from the United States, through New Bruns-wick and Nova Scotia, whether the origin of the \"under-taking\" be in New Brunswick or not. As long as such \"undertaking\" connects the Province of New Brunswick with any other province, or extends beyond the limits of the province, 92 (10) (a) applies. As it has been said by Lord Reid in the Empress Hotel case[10], the purpose of the section,\nis to deal with means of interprovincial communication. Such com\u00admunication can be provided by organizations or undertakings, but not by inanimate things alone.\nAs to the submissions of the respondent concerning the ownership of the highways and the status of the appellant who is a \"foreign national\", I agree with what has been said by my brother Rand.\nThere remains a further question to be determined. If, as I think, the operations of the appellant are an \"under-taking\" which as such fall under federal control, it does not follow that the provinces may not enact legislation relating to all that is not interprovincial traffic, or \"inci\u00addental\" thereto. Interprovincial communications are not of provincial concern, and therefore the appellant may without the authorization of the Province of New Brunswick, debus a passenger coming from the United States, in the limits of the province, and embus a passenger in New Brunswick whose destination is outside the province and vice versa, and also extend stop-over privileges as an incident of the operations. But the embussing of passengers at a point within the province to another point also within the province, presents an entirely different situation. This is not \"interprovincial communication\", and I cannot see how it can be said that it is \"incidental\" to the undertaking from which it is severable. It is traffic of a local nature, which falls under provincial jurisdiction.\nIt is probable, that conflicts will arise between both, federal and provincial jurisdictions, but the courts are not legislative bodies. Their duty is to apply the law as they believe it has been enacted. The co-operation of the Central Government and the provinces, is therefore essen\u00adtial, in order to arrive at a satisfactory result. As it has been said by Lord Atkin, in A.G. for British Columbia v. A.G. for Canada[11],\nIt was said that as the Provinces and the Dominion between them possess a totality of complete legislative authority; it must be possible to combine Dominion and Provincial legislation so that each within its own sphere could in co-operation with the other achieve the complete power of regulation which is desired. Their Lordships appreciate the importance of the desired aim. Unless and until a change is made in the respective legislative functions of Dominion and Province it may well be that satisfactory results for both can only be obtained by co-operation. But the legislation will have to be carefully framed, and will not be achieved by either party leaving its own sphere and encroach\u00ading upon that of the other.\nThis conclusion which I have reached does not mean, that even if federal control may be exercised over interprovincial operations as indicated, the control of the roads and high-ways and the regulation of traffic, does not remain within the jurisdiction of the provinces. Provincial Secretary of P.E.I. v. Egan[12].\nAs the present appeal is not a reference, this Court should not, I think, be called upon to answer questions which are not essential for the determination of the case. I therefore agree with my brother Locke as to the answer that should be given.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and direct the judg\u00adment of the Appeal Division to be modified accordingly. The order as to costs should be as proposed by my brother Kerwin. RAND J.:\u2011This appeal raises the question of the extent and nature of the provincial jurisdiction over highways of New Brunswick. As now constituted, the action is brought by S.M.T. Company Limited as relator on behalf of the Attorney General. That company is a carrier of passengers by bus under a licence to operate on named highways which include one running from St. Stephen near the international boundary bordering the state of Maine, through the cities of Saint John and Moncton and on to the boundary with Nova Scotia. The appellant, Winner, is an American citizen of Maine, who conducts a bus line which for some time prior to 1949 had been operating between Boston and Halifax over the highway mentioned. In June, 1949, he was granted a licence under The Motor Carrier Act for the operation of his buses, subject to the restric\u00adtion that no passengers could be set off or taken on in the province. The result was that only an operation across the province was authorized. In disregard of that limita\u00adtion, he is taking up and setting down passengers without reference to originating point or destination.\nThe statutory provisions applicable to highway and bus operations in New Brunswick are contained in two statutes, The Motor Vehicle Act and The Motor Carrier Act. The former provides generally for the registration of every motor vehicle using the highways and, by s. 58, for the making of regulations dealing, among other things, with fixing fees, classifying vehicles, regulating the size, weight, equipment or loads to be permitted, the speed and handling of traffic, and the operation of vehicles of other provinces or of foreign countries. Among the regulations made are:\n9\u20114. Any commercial vehicle, except a passenger bus, owned by a non-resident and duly and fully registered and licensed in his home province, state or country, used only for international and interprovincial transportation but not for intra-provincial transportation may be oper\u00adated on the highways of New Brunswick without registration and licensing in the province.\n13\u20118. No person operating a motor vehicle as a public carrier be\u00adtween fixed termini outside the province shall operate such motor vehicle on the highways of the province unless the operator is in possession of a permit issued by the department setting forth the conditions under which such motor vehicle may operate and after payment of such fees as the Minister may determine fair and equitable. The Motor Carrier Act, as its name implies; deals with the business of public carriage on the highways. By s. 2(1) (f) as amended, a public motor bus is defined to mean:\nA motor vehicle plying or standing for hire by, or used to carry, passengers at separate fares.\nAs enacted in 1937, the clause read:\n\"Public Motor Bus\" means a motor vehicle plying or standing for hire by, or used to carry, passengers at separate fares to, from or in any part of the province.\nThis was amended in 1939 by striking out the words \"to, from or in any part of the province\", and substituting therefor: \"from any point within the province to a destina\u00adtion also within the province\": in 1949 this last clause was struck out. By s. 3, the members of the Board of Com\u00admissioners of Public Utilities are constituted a board for the purposes of the Act; sub-s. (3) endows the Board in relation to motor carriers with all the jurisdiction vested in it in respect of common carriers; sub-s. (4) provides:\nThe Board may grant to any person, firm or company a licence to operate or cause to be operated public motor buses or public motor trucks over specified routes and between specified points 'within the province.\nSubsections (3) and (4) of section 5 provide that in determining whether a licence shall be granted, the Board shall give consideration to services furnished by railroads, street railways, or motor carriers, the likelihood of the proposed service being permanent and continuous, and its effect on other services. If found to be in the public interest, the service may be licenced on security being furnished.\nSection 8 regulates the abandonment or discontinuance of any service authorized; s. 11 limits public bus or truck operation to that specified in the licence; 17(1) empowers the Board to fix schedules, rates, fares and charges, to fix fees payable to the province, to prescribe forms, to require the filing of returns, and generally to do what is considered necessary or expedient for the safety and convenience of the public; and by s. 21, every licenced carrier is to be deemed a public utility.\nThese provisions appear to me to be broad enough to empower the Board to restrict the licence as it did. The two statutes exhibit clearly two different matters of regulation, that is, of highways as such and of services carried on by means of vehicles using them. The primary jurisdiction of the province in the field of the former is unchallenged; equally so is that over uncomplicated local services. The substantial contention is that under section 92, head 10(a) of the British North America Act, there is here an undertaking, including all four classes of services, that is, traffic between points in the United States and points in New Brunswick, between United States points and Canadian points involving trans-provincial services through New Brunswick, between points in New Brunswick and points in other provinces, and finally between points in New Brunswick alone, which in its entirety is beyond provincial control.\nMr. Inches, for the relator, and Mr. Carter, for the Attorney General of New Brunswick, supported by the Attorneys General of all of the provinces represented except, in certain respects, the Attorney General of Nova Scotia, assert the right of the province to regulate and control without restriction all traffic of this nature on the highways, regardless of origin or destination. That authority is based primarily on what is said to be the ownership of the highways, which, as claimed, is as exten\u00adsive in its legislative consequences as that of other public property of the province, to which it is assimilated. The Attorney General for Nova Scotia, on the other hand, represented by Mr. MacDonald, distinguishes between local and other carriage. Agreeing that the undertaking of Winner is not within head 10(a), he concedes that inter-national, interprovincial and transprovincial movements fall severally within the residual powers of section 91.\nThe claim made for provincial control is, in my opinion, excessive. The first and fundamental accomplishment of the constitutional Act was the creation of a single political organization of subjects of His Majesty within the geo\u00adgraphical area of the Dominion, the basic postulate of which was the institution of a Canadian citizenship. Citizenship is membership in a state; and in the citizen inhere those rights and duties, the correlatives of allegiance and protection, which are basic to that status. The Act makes no express allocation of citizenship as the subject-matter of legislation to either the Dominion or the provinces; but as it lies at the foundation of the political organization, as its character is national, and by the implication of head 25, section 91, \"Naturalization and Aliens\", it is to be found within the residual powers of the Dominion: Canada Temperance case[13], at p. 205. What-ever else might have been said prior to. 1931, the Statute of Westminster, coupled with the declarations of consti\u00adtutional relations of 1926 out of which it issued, creating, in substance, a sovereignty, concludes the question.\nBut incidents of status must be distinguished from elements or attributes necessarily involved in status itself. British subjects have never enjoyed an equality in all civil or political privileges or immunities as is illustrated in Cunningham v. Tomay Homme[14], in which the Judicial Committee maintained the right of British Columbia to exclude a naturalized person from the electoral franchise.. On the other hand, in Bryden's case[15], a statute of the same province that forbade the employment of Chinamen, aliens or naturalized, in underground mining operations, was found to be incompetent. As explained in Homma's case, that decision is to be taken as determining,\nthat the regulations there impeached were not really aimed at the regula\u00adtion of metal mines at all, but were in truth devised to deprive the Chinese, naturalized or not, of the ordinary rights of the inhabitants of British Columbia and, in effect, to prohibit their continued residence in that province, since it prohibited their earning their living in that province.\nWhat this implies is that a province cannot, by depriving a Canadian of the means of working, force him to leave it: it cannot divest him of his right or capacity to remain and to engage in work there: that capacity inhering as a con\u00adstituent element of his citizenship status is beyond nulli\u00adfication by provincial action. The contrary view would involve the anomaly that although British Columbia could not by mere prohibition deprive a naturalized foreigner of his means of livelihood, it could do so to a native-born Canadian. He may, of course, disable himself from exer\u00adcising his capacity or he may be regulated in it by valid provincial law in other aspects. But that attribute of citizenship lies outside of those civil rights committed to the province, and is analogous to the capacity of a Dominion corporation which the province cannot sterilize.\nIt follows, a fortiori, that a province cannot prevent a Canadian from entering it except, conceivably, in tempor\u00adary circumstances, for some local reason as, for example, health. With such a prohibitory power, the country could be converted into a number of enclaves and the \"union\" which the original provinces sought and obtained disrupted. In a like position is a subject of a friendly foreign country; for practical purposes he enjoys all the rights of the citizen.\nSuch, then, is the national status embodying certain inherent or constitutive characteristics, of members of the Canadian public, and it can be modified, defeated or destroyed, as for instance by outlawry, only by Parliament.\nHighways are a condition of the existence of an organized state: without them its life could not be carried on. To deny their use is to destroy the fundamental liberty of action of the individual, to proscribe his participation in that life: under such a ban, the exercise of citizenship would be at an end. A narrower constitutional considera\u00adtion arises. Civil life in this country consists of inextric\u00adably intermingled activities and relations within the legis\u00adlative jurisdiction of both Parliament and Legislature; and deprivation of the use of highways would confound matters appertaining to both. To prevent a person from engaging in business at a post office or a customs house or a bank by forbidding him the use of highways is, so far, to frustrate a privilege imbedded in Dominion law. These considera\u00adtions are, I think, sufficient to demonstrate that the privilege of using highways is likewise an essential attribute of Canadian citizenship status.\nThe province is thus seen to be the quasi-trustee of its highways to enable the life of the country as a whole to be carried on; they are furnished for the Canadian public and not only or primarily that of New Brunswick. Upon the province is cast the duty of providing and administering them, for which ample powers are granted; and the privilege of user can be curtailed directly by the province only within the legislative and administrative field of highways as such or in relation to other subject-matter within its exclusive field. The privilege of operating on the highway now enjoyed by Winner so far constitutes therefore the equivalent of a right-of-way.\nWith these considerations in mind, the approach to the controversy before the Court becomes clearer. Head 10 of section 92 reads:\n10. Local works and undertakings other than such as are of the following classes:\u2011\n(a) Lines of steam or other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs, and other works and undertakings connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of the province:\n(b) Lines of steam ships between the province and .any British or foreign country:\n(c) Such works as, although wholly situate within the province, are before or after their execution declared by the Parliament of Canada to be for the general advantage of Canada or for the advantage of two or more of the provinces.\nWhat is an \"undertaking\"? The early use of the word was in relation to services of various kinds of which that of the carrier was prominent. He would take into his custody or under his care either goods or persons, and he was said then to have \"assumed\" or \"undertaken\", on terms, their carriage from one place to another; to that might be added the obligation to accept and carry, drawn on himself by a public profession: and the service, together with the means and organization, constituted the under-taking. This is generalized for the purposes of head 10 by Lord Dunedin in the Radio case: \" 'Undertaking' is not a physical thing but is an arrangement under which of course physical things are used\", language used by way of contrasting \"works\" with \"undertakings\". But it is or can be of an elastic nature and the essential consideration in any case is its proper scope and dimensions.\nOne characteristic of carriage is the entirety of the individual service, that is to say, from point A to point B : to be broken down at provincial boundary lines destroys it and creates something quite different: even a trans-provincial movement is an inseverable part of a larger entity. Under the ban imposed here, interprovincial and international trade on highways would be seriously inter\u00adfered with if not in large measure destroyed. It was argued that the expression \"works and under-takings\" should be read conjunctively, and that whatever else might be said of an organized bus service, it could not be called a \"work\". But in the interpretative attitude of the Judicial Committee as expressed in Edwards v. Attor\u00adney General of Canada[16], and as exemplified in the Radio case[17], the modes of works and undertakings within head 10(a) await the developments of the years; and the specific enumerations, buttressed by the general considerations of provincial and dominion scope, are sufficient to warrant a disjunctive construction, although obviously in some cases both may be satisfied. Indeed the question would seem to be concluded by the language of Lord Dunedin in the Radio decision at p. 315.\nCarriage by motor vehicle ranges from an individual passenger or a carton of goods carried for reward in a private automobile to a highly organized fleet of buses or trucks covering the country from East to West. Within this expanse all degrees of service might be provided; and we can visualize interprovincial carrier units and local units brought under one ownership and direction with the total operations integrated into a system, the initial form of which might have been either. Even though local services should be limited to those incidental to the others, the multiplication of units, say, over different interpro\u00advincial routes could cover a great part of a province, and the incidental be converted into the principal. Local trans-port has come to furnish a multiplicity of short range accommodations to the immediate necessities of modern life, especially in the larger centres of population: it has in fact become more or less incidental to employment and to community life generally. Its services have thus taken on characteristics distinguishing them from long distance carriage of any form.\nWhat is denoted by the words of 10(a) is, ex facie, an interprovincial or an international function; no attempt has been made to show any necessary bond in fact or in legislative administration between either of them and the local feature here; and in determining in any case what can properly be taken to be embraced within an under-taking, created as Winner's has been, the interwoven character of legislative distribution under sections 91 and 92 of the Act of 1867 becomes significant.\nThe analogy of railways and telegraphs was pressed upon us. These works are specifically named, and it is the clear implication that their total functioning was to be under a single legislature. But even they are limited to essential objects: Attorney General for British Columbia v. C.P.R.[18], in which a hotel operated by the company was held not to be part of the railway. There is toward them also a notion of fixity and determinateness that, although somewhat elusive, underlies the restriction of a declaration of dominion advantage under paragraph 10(c) to a \"work\". But the building-up of an aggregate of services into a unity of operation introduces considerations of a different nature.\nThe judgment of this Court in Quebec Railway v. Beau-port[19], is not in pari materia. There an original railway work declared to be for the general advantage of Canada was subsequently authorized to carry on bus services; those with which the proceedings were concerned had been integrated with the railway and tramway services; and the identity of the original work and undertaking had been maintained.\nWhatever may be said of the physical instruments of transportation per se, the function of carriage is an essential element of trade and commerce; it has no other raison d'\u00eatre. As an arterial system, from its trunk lines to the minutest ramifications, in the circulation of persons and goods, it furnishes the moving life of trade and commerce.\nThe question before us, then, is analogous to that pre\u00adsented in Lawson v. Committee[20], in which Duff J. (later C.J.) at p. 366, said:\nThe scope which might be ascribed to head 2 s. 91 (Trade and Commerce) has necessarily been limited, in order to preserve from serious curtailment, if not from virtual extinction, the degree of autonomy * * * the provinces were intended to possess.\nThat necessity exists in the automotive field of carriage, and the lines of limitation are indicated by those laid down for trade and commerce. Assuming then that the international and interprovincial components of Winner's service are such an undertaking as head 10 envisages, the question is whether, by his own act, for the purposes of the statute, he can annex to it the local services. Under the theory advanced by Mr. Tennant, given an automobile, an individual can, by piecemeal accumulation, bring within paragraph 10(a) a day-to-day fluctuating totality of operations of the class of those here in question. The result of being able to do so could un\u00addoubtedly introduce a destructive interference with the balanced and co-ordinated administration by the province of what is primarily a local matter; and the public interest would suffer accordingly. There is no necessary entirety to such an aggregate and I cannot think it a sound con\u00adstruction of the section to permit the attraction, by such mode, to dominion jurisdiction of severable matter that otherwise would belong to the province.\nBut if, in relation to those primary components, the service is not such an undertaking, then, for the reasons given, it comes under the Dominion regulation of Trade and Commerce. In any case it would fall within the residual powers.\nIt follows that the province, in the absence of any justifying consideration relating to highway administration or other sufficient exclusive provincial matter, was without power, having admitted these buses to the highways, to prevent them from setting down or taking up either inter-national or interprovincial traffic. On the other hand, it could forbid the taking up or setting down of passengers travelling solely between points in the province.\nThe judgment of the Appeal Division, holding against Winner on all points, was in the form of giving answers to questions referred to. it by the trial judge as follows:\n1. Are the operations or proposed operations of the Defendants within the Province of New Brunswick or any part or parts thereof as above set forth, prohibited or in any way affected by the provisions of The Motor Carrier Act (1937) and amendments thereto, or orders made by the said Motor Carrier Board?\n2. Is 13 Geo. VI c. 48 (1940) intra vires of the legislature of the province of New Brunswick?\n3. Are the proposed operations prohibited or in any way affected by Regulation 13 of The Motor Vehicle Act, c. 20 of the Acts of 1934 and amendments, or under section 6 or 53 or any other sections of The Motor Vehicle Act? As can be seen, they distribute both statutes, and in doing so, they go beyond the actual issues raised by the pleadings. It would be virtually impossible either to anti\u00adcipate all conceivable points of impact of the statutes directly or indirectly on Winner's operations or to deal with them by any other than general answers. The real issue is whether he can be restrained from taking up and setting down passengers in New Brunswick: the answer to that is: only when it is done in the course of carriages which in their entirety begin and end at points in New Brunswick.\nI would allow the appeal and direct the judgment of the Appeal Division to be modified accordingly. The appellant, Winner, is entitled to two-thirds of his costs in this Court and all of his costs in the Appeal Division. The motion of the respondent to review the order that there be no costs either for or against the intervenant railways is dismissed without costs. No other costs are allowed.\nKELLOCK J.:\u2011When the appeal was opened, the court raised the question as to the right of the respondent com\u00adpany to sue. In answer, reference was made to the decision of the Appeal Division of New Brunswick in New Brunswick Power Co. v. Maritime Transit[21]. It would appear that that decision proceeded on the view that the holder of a licence under The Motor Carrier Act was in a position analogous to the holder of a franchise of market or ferry, and that the court in deciding that ease had not had its attention called to the decision of the House of Lords in Institute of Patent Agents v. Lockwood[22], and to the view expressed by Eve J. in Attorney General v. Premier Line[23]. Without deciding the question thus raised, it was arranged that an application would be made to the court of New Brunswick to add the Attorney General ex rel the company respondent as plaintiff in the action. That has now been done, and the proceedings amended accord\u00adingly.\nThe appeal comes to this court upon answers given by, the Appeal Division to certain questions of law referred to that court by an order of the court of first instance on the footing of a statement of facts set out in the order of reference. From these facts it appears that the appellant is in the business of operating a line of motor buses for the carriage for hire of passengers and goods from Boston in the State of Massachusetts, through the Province of New Brunswick to Halifax and Glace Bay in the Province of Nova Scotia. On the 17th day of June, 1949, he was granted a licence by the Motor Carrier Board of New Brunswick permitting these operations insofar as that province was concerned, but it was provided that he should not take up or put down passengers within the said province after August 1st of the said year. The appellant ignored the above condition and has continued since August 1, 1949, to take up and let down passengers within the province, regardless of whether such traffic originated within or without the province, or was destined to points within or without the province.\nIt is the contention of the appellant that his operations constitute an \"undertaking\" connecting the Province of New Brunswick with another province of Canada or ex-tending beyond the limits of the province, within the meaning of s. 92 (10) (a) of the British North America Act, and that, accordingly, such operations are not the subject of regulation by the legislature of New Brunswick. It is to be observed that the appellant cannot rely on any Dominion legislation such as was in question in Toronto v. Bell Telephone Co.[24]. The essence of the opposing contention is that, while the appellant may have his buses and operators for those buses, his undertaking cannot be said to include the right to use the highways of the province. It is said that such right is a common law right bestowed on the appellant as a member of the public in New Brunswick under the laws of that province, and that the control of that right is a matter within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislature.\nIn the court below, Richards C.J., while accepting the view that the bus line of the appellant might otherwise be regarded as an \"undertaking\" within the meaning of s. 92 (10) (a), thought it could not be so regarded because, in his view, it is only local works and undertakings which have their \"origin and situs within the province\" which come within the purview of the section, and therefore, as the appellant has \"no office, no place of business, no organi\u00adzation, no situs\" within the province, his operations do not come within the contemplation of the section. While the appellant's undertaking \"extends from the State of Maine into the Province of New Brunswick,\" the learned Chief Justice thought it could not be said that it \"extends beyond the limits of the province.\" Not coming, in his opinion, within the provisions of s. 92(10) (a), the learned Chief Justice was of opinion that the provincial legislation here in question was intra vires, being entirely local in character in relation to traffic within the province, and only incident-ally affecting traffic passing through the province. Harrison J. expressed similar views. In the opinion of that learned judge, the province has the right, not only to regulate but also to prohibit motor vehicle traffic. He was further of opinion that, in any event, the appellant, as a foreign national, had no status entitling him to question the validity of the legislation. Hughes J. agreed with the answers given to the questions by the other members of the court, but gave no reasons.\nIn my opinion, the fact that the appellant is an alien does not affect his right to challenge the legislation in. question. As stated by Lord Reading in Porter v. Freuden\u00adberg[25]:\nAlien friends have long since been, and are at the present day, treated in reference to civil rights as if they were British subjects, and are entitled to the enjoyment of all personal rights of a citizen * * *\nReference may also be made to Johnstone v. Pedlar[26].\nWith respect to the main ground upon which the respon\u00addents rest their case, namely, the contention that control of the use of provincial highways is a matter of civil rights within the province, I find it impossible to agree. I find nothing in s. 92 of the British North America Act which authorizes a province to shut itself off from any other province by denying entry to it to persons presenting them-selves at its borders from other provinces or another country.\nIn the words of Lord Coleridge in Bailey v. Jamieson[27], \"The common definition of a highway that is given in all the text-books of authority is, that it is a way leading from one market-town or inhabited place to another in\u00adhabited place which is common to all the Queen's subjects.\" It therefore appears at once that the right to the use of a highway is a right vested in the \"subject\" who is entitled to the exercise of that right throughout the kingdom. As the preamble to the British North America Act states that the constitution of Canada was intended to be similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom, this right, belonging equally to all Canadian subjects of His Majesty, is one which would normally be within the jurisdiction of Parliament unless another disposition has been made by the British North America Act. The only provision of that statute which is pointed to for such a result is head 13 of s. 92, but the mere statement of the nature of the right is sufficient to exclude it from the class of civil rights within the province.\nWith respect to the operation of a bus line of the nature of that here in question, I cannot accept the view of the statute taken in the court below. Such an undertaking is, in my opinion, one falling within the terms of s. 92(10) (a) and therefore, a subject matter of legislation exclusively within the jurisdiction of Parliament. The very object of the provision, to employ the words of Lord Read in the Empress Hotel case[28].\nis to deal with means of interprovincial communication. Such com\u00admunication can be provided by organizations or undertakings, but not by inanimate things alone.\nWhile this language was not there applied to circum\u00adstances similar to those in question in the case at bar, I would so apply it. The operation of an undertaking of the character contemplated by the section may not, there-fore, be prevented by provincial legislation such as that in question. The question remains, however, as to whether the whole, and if not, what part, of the appellant's opera\u00adtions may properly be regarded as falling within \"other Works and Undertakings connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces or extending beyond the limits of the province,\" as those words are employed in s. 92(10) (a). In my opinion, it is only the \"through\" as distinct from the \"local\" carriage which may be so regarded. It is with means of \"interprovincial\" communication only, that the section deals, and therefore it is only the carriage of passengers or goods from a point outside the province to points within the province or beyond the province, and from a point within the province to points beyond the province, which may properly be regarded as \"interpro\u00advincial,\" or \"connecting,\" to use the statutory language. Unlike aerial navigation, or radio, which, from their very nature, are not divisible from the local or interprovincial or international standpoints,; local carriage by bus is severable and forms no necessary part of the interprovincial or international undertaking with which s. 92(10) (a) is concerned. The words, \"Lines of ships\" and \"railways,\" as used in the section, no doubt include all traffic carried by such means, but that is because these undertakings are specifically mentioned and, being mentioned, include everything normally understood by those words. I do not think, however, that there is any compelling reason for regarding such an undertaking as is here in question as including the purely local carriage of traffic, and, in the absence of such reason, I think there are considerations which dictate the contrary view.\nAs pointed out by the respondents, local carriage of traffic by bus has become, over wide areas, an essential public service, and, unless regulated to prevent excessive competition, the section of the public dependent upon such service will often suffer. Such regulation would be im\u00adpossible if any person, merely because he operates across a provincial boundary, perhaps at no great distance away, could compete with a purely local undertaking, free from any local control. It is past question, in my opinion, that a local legislature may, as a purely local matter, authorize the granting of exclusive transport franchises within the province in the interests of the inhabitants intended to be served. Just as an interprovincial or international bus line is withdrawn from provincial control, an intra-provincial bus line is, by the same statutory provision, placed within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures.\nIf the carriage of purely local traffic is to be considered as part of the undertaking of a through bus line, there would seem to be no reason why such local traffic could not be carried by buses which do not leave the province at all, as well as by through buses. As already pointed out, the \"undertaking\" with which the statute deals is the organization under which the \"inanimate things,\" the buses, operate. The undertaking is not to be identified with the buses. If, therefore, a connecting undertaking is to be regarded as including local as well as through carriage, it is difficult to see why such an undertaking may not also carry its local traffic by a bus which does not go outside the province at all, wherever such a mode of operation is conducive to the efficient management of the undertaking.\nAgain, if it be suggested that the word \"undertaking\" is to take its colour from such a word as \"railways\" in the section, I would see no reason why, in respect of local carriage, the undertaking of a \"connecting\" bus line should be confined to buses paralleling its through line and would not also include branch lines throughout the province.\nAs I have already said, \"railways\" is specifically used in the statute and includes everything normally understood by that word. But unlike a railway which has its own right of way, buses operate on public highways and must share the way thereby furnished with others. It is the \"connecting\" undertaking which alone is committed to Dominion jurisdiction, while the local undertaking is at the same time committed to that of the provinces. To my mind, it would leave little to the latter, in the case of undertakings of the characteristics of that here in question, if the ambit of a through undertaking were cast as large as that for which the appellant contends. I therefore think that full effect can be given to that which is in the con\u00adtemplation of the section with respect to the two different kinds of undertakings by- giving to it the meaning indicated.\nAccordingly, in my opinion, the appellant, although not subject to the provincial control here asserted insofar as his through operations are concerned, can not claim the same exemption with respect to his purely local carriage. There is no doubt an area in which provincial legislation may affect the operation of even a bus line confined to \"through\" business; Provincial Secretary v. Egan[29]. It is impossible, however, to define that area apart from specific cases as they arise. In arriving at my conclusion I have not found it necessary to consider s. 91 (2) of the British North America Act, upon which the respondents did not found any argument.\nThe questions here put are broad enough to cover many matters which are not shown to be in any way in issue in this litigation. The court is not to be called upon to answer, in litigation of this character, general questions the answers to which are not required for the purpose of enabling the court charged ultimately with the duty of disposing of the litigation to determine the actual issues. It will therefore be sufficient for the purposes of the case at bar to declare that the provincial legislation here in question is not competent to prevent the appellant's undertaking from bringing passengers into the province of New Brunswick from the United States of America or another province of Canada and permitting such passengers to alight in the said province, or from picking up passengers in the province to be carried out of the same.\nI agree with the order as to costs proposed by my brother Kerwin.\nESTEY J.:\u2011In an action between S.M.T. (Eastern) Limited and Israel Winner, doing business under the name and style of MacKenzie Coach Lines, three questions were submitted by the Supreme Court, Appeal Division, in the Province of New Brunswick. From the judgment embody\u00ading the answers, leave to appeal to this Court was granted. As of February 7, 1951, the Attorney-General of New Brunswick, ex relatione S.M.T. (Eastern) Limited, was added a party as \"from the institution\" of the action.\nThe appellant Winner operates a passenger bus service between Boston in the State of Massachusetts and Halifax and Glace Bay in the Province of Nova Scotia and the question here raised is the right of the Province of New Brunswick to prohibit his embussing and debussing of passengers within that province.\nThe appellant has, at all relevant times, purchased a licence as required under The Motor Vehicle Act of New Brunswick (1934-24 Geo. V, c. 20 and amendments thereto). He has also been granted a licence by The Motor Carrier Board under the provisions of The Motor Carrier Act of that province (1937-1 Geo. VI, c. 43 and amendments thereto), the provisions of which are expressly \"deemed to be in addition to those of The Motor Vehicle Act.\"\nPrior to the amendment of 1949 the definition of \"Public Motor Bus\" read:\n2(1) (f). \"Public Motor Bus\" means a motor vehicle plying or standing for hire by, or used to carry, passengers at separate fares from any point within the province to a destination also within the province.\nS. 4 of the same Act read at that time:\n4. The Board may grant to any person firm or company a licence to operate or cause to be operated public motor buses or public motor trucks over specified routes and between specified points within the province.\nThe amendment of 1949 (13 Geo. VI, c. 47) struck out all the words in s. 2(1) (f) after the word \"fares\" and in s. 4 the words \"within the province.\" The intent and purpose and, indeed, the effect of these amendments was to enable The Motor Carrier Board to prohibit the embuss\u00ading and debussing of passengers, as it did in granting a licence to the appellant on June 17, 1949, of which the material portion reads:\nIsrael Winner doing business under the name and style of \"MacKenzie Coach Lines,\" at Lewiston in the State of Maine is granted a licence to operate public motor buses from Boston in the State of Massachusetts, through the province of New Brunswick on Highways Nos. 1 and 2, to Halifax and Glace Bay in the province of Nova Scotia and return, but not to embus or debus passengers in the said province of New Brunswick after August 1, 1949.\nIt is the contention of the province that The Motor Carrier Board, in imposing the restrictions contained in the licence, acted within its powers, and the legislation granting to it those powers is intra vires of the province.\nThe appellant submits that his passenger bus service is an undertaking within the meaning of sec. 92(10) (a) of the British North America Act, therefore subject to Do-minion legislation, and, in so far as the province seeks to restrict or prohibit his passenger bus service, its legislation is either ultra vires of the province or inoperative as against him. S. 92(10) (a) reads as follows:\n92. In each province the legislature may exclusively make laws in. relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated; that is to say,\u2011\n* * * 10. Local works and undertakings other than such as are of the following classes:\u2011\n(a) Lines of steam or other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs, and other works and undertakings connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of the province:\nThe word \"local\" in the foregoing s. 92(10) (a), with great respect, cannot be restricted in its scope and mean\u00ading as held by the learned judges of the Appellate Court. The section read as a whole indicates that included in the phrase \"local works and undertakings\" are activities other than, as well as those which were initiated or have their head offices in the province. It is rather the scope of the operations that determines the legislative jurisdiction.\nThe submission on behalf of the Attorney-General of New Brunswick that the words in s. 92(10) (a) \"or extend\u00ading beyond the limits of the province,\" must be restricted to an extension into some portion of what is now the Dominion of Canada, although it finds support in a reading of s. 92(10) (a) and (b) together, does not otherwise find such support as to justify its acceptance. Sub-para. (b) is restricted to \"Lines of Steamships.\" Even the words \"or other ships\" are not included. It makes no mention of railways, canals and telegraphs, nor are they elsewhere similarly dealt with. Yet there can be no doubt that the possibility of railways, canals and telegraphs extending into the United States must have been present to those associated with the drafting of the British North America Act. In fact, at least one province contemplated the build\u00ading of such a railway prior to Confederation. It seems difficult to conclude that this possibility was not provided for by the insertion of the unrestricted language just quoted. If there be an overlapping with respect to lines of steamships between (a) and (b) that, I think, must be attributed to abundant caution in relation to some matter present to the drafsmen in respect of lines of steamships.\nAs to the meaning of \"works and undertakings\" under s. 92(10) (a), Lord Reid, in C.P.R. v. A.G. for British Columbia (Empress Hotel ease)[30], stated:\nThe latter part of the paragraph makes it clear that the object of the paragraph is to deal with means of interprovincial communication. Such communication can be provided by organizations or undertakings, but not by inanimate things alone. For this object the phrase \"lines of steamship\" is appropriate. That phrase is commonly used to denote not only the ships concerned but also the organization which makes them regularly available between certain points.\nIn the Radio case[31], Viscount Dunedin, in referring to s. 92(10) (a), stated:\n\"Undertaking\" is not a physical thing, but is an arrangement under which of course physical things are used.\nThe appellant's organization under which he operates his bus service is, within the foregoing, an arrangement connecting New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. This arrangement, together with his equipment, constitutes a works and undertaking within the meaning of s. 92(10) (a).\nThere is no question but that the highways are subject to the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the provinces. Provincial Secretary of Prince Edward Island v. Egan[32].\nAt the hearing there was some discussion as to the owner-ship of the highways in New Brunswick. Whatever the precise position may be in regard to their ownership, whether the province holds them as trustee for the public or whether the right of passage is in the nature of a public easement, for the purpose of this litigation it is sufficient that the province possesses, within the meaning of the British North America Act, complete legislative jurisdiction over its highways.\nThe appellant, once within the province, has a right to pass and repass his buses over the provincial highways, without regard to his citizenship or residence, upon his compliance with competently enacted provincial legislation. The province has not, at any time, disputed his right in this connection and he, on his part, has, by the purchase of the necessary licences, indicated a clear intention to comply with such legislation. In fact, he has, and his right to do so is not here in question, carried passengers, from points outside, through the province to points beyond it.\nIn respect of the embussing and debussing of international and interprovincial passengers within the province, while the contracts for their transportation are made both within and without the province, in every case such contracts are performed in part within and in part without the province. They constitute an inherent and important part of the appellant's works and undertaking and give to it that essential characteristic that, in the scheme of the British North America Act, places the appellant's bus service, by virtue of s. 92(10) (a), under the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion. While it was contended by certain of the Attorneys-General that the province possesses the power to prohibit an international and interprovincial bus to pass and repass upon its highways, no authority was cited to that effect. The Dominion of Canada was created by the British North America Act as \"one Dominion under the name of Canada.\" (s. 3) ; and there shall be \"one Parlia\u00adment for Canada\" (s. 17). Moreover, there is but one Canadian citizenship and, throughout, the British North America Act contemplates that citizens, and all others who may be for the time being in Canada, shall enjoy freedom of passage throughout the Dominion, subject to com\u00adpliance with competent provincial legislation.\nThere remains for consideration the embussing and de-bussing by the appellant of intraprovincial passengers. Immediately the 1949 licence was issued he contended the prohibition was ultra vires of the province and has since carried on his business in complete disregard thereof. His position was that he had a right to carry on his international and interprovincial bus service and, as \"incidental\" there-to, to embus and debus, including intraprovincial, passen\u00adgers. He did not intimate what he included in the word \"incidental,\" but it would appear that he at least meant the embussing and debussing of intraprovincial passengers along his route in New Brunswick.\nIn support of his contention counsel directed our attention to railways and telegraphs. These works and undertakings are quite different in character. The owners of the former provide the roadbed and tracks, the latter the wire and poles, and both provide all other facilities necessary to their respective operations. The appellant's works and undertaking consist of his buses and the arrangement under which they are operated. As such, his works and undertaking are designed and developed to operate upon the provincial highways, which must be located, con\u00adstructed, maintained and controlled by the province. The essential difference is that, while railways and telegraphs operate upon their own property, the appellant operates his bus service upon the highways maintained and con-trolled by the province. The factors that militate against a practical severance of the intraprovincial railway and telegraph businesses are not, to an important degree, present in the appellant's bus service as he has developed it, or as it would be in the ordinary course of such a busi\u00adness. Moreover, from the point of view of the province, it constitutes the utilization of its highways for a purely provincial purpose and, if permitted upon main highways, would go far to destroy the system under which the province has deemed it advisable, if not necessary, to licence the carriage of passengers and goods by buses.\nThe appellant's essential business is the international and interprovincial carriage of passengers. His buses and the arrangement under which he operates constitute his works and undertaking, all of which are subject to legislative jurisdiction of parliament, and if he enters the province and complies with competent provincial legislation, as already stated, the highways must be available to him. Whenever he seeks to utilize the highways for the further purpose of the carriage of intraprovincial passengers he is outside the scope of his works and undertaking, under 92(10) (a). If, therefore, he desires to enter into the bus business of carrying intraprovincial passengers, he must comply with competent provincial legislation in relation thereto.\nIt should be noted that in this litigation we are not concerned with a body corporate, created and granted certain powers by the Parliament of Canada with respect to which other considerations may arise, but rather with an individual whose works and undertaking are the inter-national and interprovincial carriage of passengers.\nThere may, in the future, be important questions as to what particular circumstances may constitute international, interprovincial or intraprovincial passengers. These ques\u00adtions must, of course, be decided as they arise, but it does seem necessary to intimate here that the appellant would be entitled to accord to international and interprovincial passengers stop-over privileges, as that term is understood in systems of transportation, without their being regarded as intraprovincial passengers, as they embus and debus within the province. The hearing of this appeal has been restricted to the right of the appellant to carry passengers. The questions appear to have been drafted in broader terms than neces\u00adsary to determine the issues now raised in this litigation. Indeed, it would appear to be a sufficient answer to all of the questions to say that provincial legislation, in so far as it prohibits the embussing or debussing of international and interprovincial passengers, is ultra vires the province. In particular, the amendment of 1949 to The Motor Carrier Act, in so far as it makes provision therefor, is 'ultra vires. The same may be said of Regulation 1'3 and Section 58 of The Motor Vehicle Act under which it is authorized.\nI agree with my brother Kerwin's disposition of costs.\nLOCKE J.:\u2011The appellant is a carrier of passengers and freight for reward, operating motor buses from Boston, Massachusetts, to Glace Bay, Nova Scotia. In traversing the Province of New Brunswick en route these vehicles stop in a number of places between St. Stephen and Sackville. The appellant asserts that as such a carrier he is entitled to bring passengers from the United States and from the Province of Nova Scotia into the Province of New Bruns-wick, to carry passengers from the latter province to the United States or to Nova Scotia and \"in connection with and incidentally to his international and interprovincial operations\" to carry passengers from one point in New Brunswick to another. Both in his pleadings and in the factum filed before us the appellant has made it plain that he does not claim an unqualified right to carry passengers from one point to another within the province, except to the extent above indicated. This I understand to mean that he may extend stop-over privileges to his passengers, as is commonly done by railway companies: thus, by way of illustration, a person travelling from Boston to Sackville might stop over at St. Stephen and at Saint John and be carried between these points, and from the latter point to Sackville under the contract of carriage. The question to be determined is whether by legislation the Province of New Brunswick can lawfully prevent the carrying on of these activities. Heading 10 of section 92 of the British North America Act, in so far as it affects this matter, reads:\nLocal works and undertakings other than such as are of the following classes:\n(a) Lines of steam or other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs, and other works and undertakings connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of the province:\nThe operations of the appellant consist of the daily operation of motor buses between the above mentioned points, these running in accordance with a published time table, carrying passengers and their luggage and freight in both directions. A time table, made part of the material submitted with the questions to the Court, under the heading \"Index of Stations and Agents\" lists a number of places in New Brunswick between St. Stephen and Sackville where these are maintained, and this affords the only evidence as to the extent of the business carried on within the province, other than the stated fact that the motor buses are operated in the above mentioned manner.\nThe word \"undertaking\" is, in the absence of a statutory definition, and there is none, to be given its commonly accepted meaning as being a business undertaking or enter-prise and, in my opinion, it is beyond doubt that the appellant's business falls within this description. I think it equally clear that it connects the province of New Brunswick with another of the provinces and extends beyond the limits of the province. It is not a physical connection that is referred to (In re the Regulation and Control of Radio[33]). Richards C.J.A. and Harrison J. were both of the opinion that the appellant's business was not such an undertaking, since they considered that, in order to fall within the class of matters referred to in subheading (a), it was necessary that the undertaking should be local in its nature. As the learned Chief Justice expressed it, the works and undertakings referred to are those \"which have their origin and situs within the province.\" Mr. Justice Harrison considered that, as the defendant had no office or location of any kind in New Brunswick and the time table showed his office to be at Lewiston, Maine: \"the undertaking was 'local' in the State of Maine. It is not local in New Brunswick.\" The opening phrase of heading 10 is clearly capable of the construction given to it by these learned judges, namely, that it is to be interpreted as if it read:\nLocal works and undertakings other than such local works and undertakings as are of the following classes:\nThe matter, however, appears to me to be concluded by authority. In A.G. for British Columbia v. C.P.R.[34] and in Toronto Corporation v. C.P.R.[35], it was held by the Judicial Committee that heading 10(a) applied to the undertaking of that company. In Lunar Collieries v. McDonald[36], it was held that the subsection applied to the undertaking of the Canadian Northern Railway Com\u00adpany. The undertakings of these companies cannot be described as \"local\" in the sense that that term has been construed by the learned judges of the Appeal Division, so that I think it must be taken either that subheading (a) refers to undertakings other than such as are merely local in their nature and extent, or that a \"local\" undertaking includes one such as that of the appellant, which carries on its enterprise in whole or in part within the boundaries of the province.\nSection 91 declares the power of Parliament to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by the Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the provinces and:\nthat (notwithstanding anything in this Act) the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated.\nIn City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway[37], Lord Atkinson, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, said that the effect of heading 10 of s. 92 was to transfer the excepted works mentioned in subheadings (a), (b) and (c) of it into s. 91 and thus to place them under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of the Dominion Parliament. This applies with equal force to the excepted undertakings, in my opinion. It is thus for Parliament to say whether these activities of the appellant may be carried on or prohibited. This is, in my opinion, decisive of the question as to the right of the province to prevent the appellant from bring\u00ading passengers into the province and permitting them to alight and transporting passengers therefrom. There remains the question as to the right of the appellant to engage in what may properly, in my opinion, be described as the local business of carrying passengers other than those entering the province upon his buses, or leaving it in that manner, from place to place within the province. Whether these operations also fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament must be decided by determining the exact nature of the undertakings excepted from pro\u00advincial jurisdiction by subheading 10(a). These are under-takings connecting the province with another province or extending beyond the provincial limits. The appellant's enterprise is, I think, correctly described in the statement of defence as an international and interprovincial operation. It is properly a part of such an operation to afford to passengers brought into the province, or those who embark upon the buses to be carried out of the province, what are commonly called stop-over privileges of the nature above referred to as an incident of the contract of carriage. I consider, however, that the carrying on of a purely local passenger business of the nature above referred to is not a part of, or reasonably incidental to, the operation of an undertaking of this nature. It is not every activity that the person engaged in the undertaking may decide to carry on in connection with its operation that falls within the exception. The establishment of restaurants at various places in New Brunswick through which the buses of the appellant pass might be an aid to the financial success of the undertaking, but such operations would not, in my view, be part of the undertaking excepted from the pro\u00advincial jurisdiction. I think a purely local passenger business of the above mentioned nature is in no different position. The distinction between an undertaking such as this and that of the railway companies is that in the case of the latter it is an essential of the operation that there should be railway stations established at regular intervals along the line and large expenditures incurred for that purpose, and that there be facilities afforded for the carriage of both passengers and freight between these stations as a necessary part of an effective railway opera\u00adtion. These considerations do not, in my opinion, apply to an undertaking such as that of the appellant.\nThis matter has been brought before us by special leave, to appeal granted by the Appeal Division. Two of the questions were submitted for the opinion of that Court by an order of Hughes J. made in the Chancery Division of the Supreme Court, and a third question as to whether the operations of the appellant were prohibited or affected by the provisions of The Motor Carrier Act, 1937, as amended, and The Motor Vehicle Act, as amended, or by the regula\u00adtions made under the last mentioned statute, was added by consent of counsel for the parties. The claim of the plaintiff S.M.T. (Eastern) Ltd. against the defendant in the action, the present appellant, was that while the appel\u00adlant had obtained a licence from the Motor Carrier Board this would not permit him \"to embus or debus passengers in the said Province of New Brunswick after August 1, 1949,\" that the defendant had in spite of this continued to embus and debus passengers within the province and intended to continue to do so, whereby the plaintiff had suffered and would thereafter suffer damage. By the statement of defence it was admitted that the appellant had and intended to continue to permit passengers to alight within the province and to enter the buses within the province in connection with, and incidentally to, his inter-national and interprovincial operations, and by counter-claim the defendant sought a declaration that his under-taking was within the exception contained in subheading 10(a) of s. 92 of the British North America Act, that his operations were not prohibited by, or subject to, The Motor Carrier Act and amendments thereto or by any other applicable statute or law,\" and that the statute 13 Geo. VI, c. 47 (1949) is ultra vires the legislature of the province. The defence to the counterclaim repeated the allegations in the statement of claim, denied that the defendant's operations were primarily international and interprovincial, demurred on the ground that the counterclaim disclosed no cause of action and said that the 1949 statute was intra vires. The plaintiff did not plead to, or raise any issue as to, that part of the claim advanced in the counterclaim in which a declaration was asked that the defendant's operations were not prohibited by, or subject in any way to, the provisions of The Motor Carrier Act and amend\u00adments or by any other applicable statute. No attack had been made upon The Motor Vehicle Act or the regulations passed under that Act by the counterclaim. The Motor Carrier Act of New Brunswick is a statute containing some 22 sections, while there are 92 sections to The Motor Vehicle Act and a lengthy series of regulations. I do not think we should be asked to deal with constitutional ques\u00adtions of such great importance in this manner. This is not a reference to a provincial court for its opinion by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of a province under a statute such as the Constitutional Questions Determination Acts of other provinces: rather are we asked, at least by the third question, to decide issues not defined in the pleadings because counsel for the respective parties request it.\nI think it is well to remember what was said by Sir Montague Smith in Citizens' Insurance Company of Canada v. Parsons[38], that in performing the difficult duty of deciding questions arising as to the interpretation of sections 91 and 92 we should decide each case which arises as best we can, without entering more largely upon an interpretation of the statute than is necessary for the decision of the particular question in hand. The particular questions to be determined in the present matter are as to whether by legislation of the province an undertaking such as that of the appellant may be prohibited from bringing passengers into the Province of New Brunswick from the United States and from Nova Scotia and per\u00admitting them to alight: from admitting passengers to its buses to be carried out of the province, and to carry passengers along the route traversed by its buses from place to place in New Brunswick to whom stop-over privileges have been extended as an incident of the contract of carriage. The answer to each of these questions is, in my opinion, in the negative. This is sufficient, in my opinion, to dispose of the issues properly raised by the pleadings in this action. I think no further answer should be made.\nI agree with the order as to costs proposed by my brother Kerwin. CARTWRIGHT J.:\u2011This is an appeal brought pursuant to special leave granted by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick from a judgment of that Court answering certain questions of law, said to arise in this action, raised for its opinion by order of Hughes J.\nThe agreed statement of facts, the questions and the answers given are sufficiently set out in the reasons of other members of the Court and do not require repetition.\nWith great respect, I think that the procedure followed in this ease has proved inconvenient and that the questions in issue between the parties could have been more satis\u00adfactorily dealt with if the action had been tried and judg\u00adment given leaving any party dissatisfied to appeal if so advised. It is not the duty of the Court in an. action to decide questions of law, however interesting or important, except such as require to be determined to enable the Court to pronounce judgment. To make a complete answer to questions 1 and 3 it would be necessary to examine every provision of The Motor Carrier's Act, of the orders of the Motor Carrier Board and of The Motor Vehicle Act and to state as to each of such provisions whether it affects the operations or the proposed operations of the appellant and if so in what way, although, in this action, as to most of them no question appears to arise at all.\nOur first task seems to me to be to ascertain from the pleadings and the assumed facts what questions of law properly arise for determination at this stage of the proceedings.\nThe plaintiffs in the action are now the Attorney General of New Brunswick ex relatione S.M.T. (Eastern) Ltd. and the said S.M.T. (Eastern) Ltd.\nParagraphs '5, 6, and 7 of the Statement of Claim read as follows:\n5. On the 17th day of June, 1949, the said Motor Carrier Board granted a licence to the defendant, permitting him to operate public motor buses from Boston in the State of Massachusetts through the Province of New Brunswick on Highways Nos. 1 and 2 to Halifax and Glace Bay in the Province of Nova Scotia and return, but not to embus or debus passengers in the said Province of New Brunswick after August 1, 1949.\n6. The defendant by his motor buses maintains a daily passenger service over the routes set out in paragraph 5 hereof. 7. Since August 1, 1949, the defendant has continually embussed and debussed passengers within the said Province of New Brunswick, con\u00adtrary to the said order, dated the 17th day of June, 1949, and has declared his intention of so doing until stopped by legal process.\nIn the prayer for relief the plaintiffs claim:\n(a) An injunction against the defendant, his servants or agents restraining him and them from embussing and debussing passengers within the Province of New Brunswick in his public motor buses running between St. Stephen, N.B. and the Nova Scotia border.\n(b) A declaration that the defendant has no legal right to embuss or debuss passengers within the Province of New Brunswick.\n(e) Such other and further relief as to the Court may seem just.\nThe plaintiff company also claims damages and an accounting.\nIn its Statement of Defence the appellant admits paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Statement of Claim. Paragraphs 2 and 4 of the Statement of Defence read as follows:\n2. As to paragraph (7) of the said Statement of Claim\u2011\n(a) he admits that since August 1, 1949, he has continually embussed and debussed passengers within the Province of New Brunswick and that it is his intention to continue to do so unless and until it shall have been declared by some court of competent jurisdiction that such operations are prohibited by The Motor Carrier Act and amendments thereto, or by any other applicable statute or law;\n(b) he intends to carry passengers not only from points without the Province of New Brunswick to points within the said province and vice versa, but also, in connection with and incidentally to his international and interprovincial operations, to carry passengers from points within the said province to des\u00adtinations also within the said province, unless and until it shall have been declared by some court of competent jurisdiction that such operations are prohibited by The Motor Carrier Act and amendments thereto, or by any other applicable statute or law.\n4. His operation of public motor buses is primarily international and interprovincial, over the routes more particularly described in paragraph (5) of the plaintiff's Statement of Claim, but that incidentally to such international and interprovincial operation, he operates and intends to continue to operate public motor buses intraprovincially in accordance with and subject to his allegations contained in paragraph (2) hereof.\nBy way of counterclaim the defendant asks:\n1. A declaration that his operations constitute an undertaking con\u00adnecting the Province of New Brunswick with another province of Canada, viz., the Province of Nova Scotia, and extending into states of the United States of America, beyond the limits of the Province of New Brunswick, within the meaning of section 10 (a) of section 92 of The British North America Act. 2. A declaration that his said operations are not prohibited by or subject in any way to the provisions of The Motor Carrier Act and amendments thereto, or by or to any other applicable statute or law.\n3. A declaration that 13 George VI Chapter 47 (194g) is ultra vires of the legislature of the Province of New Brunswick.\n4. Such other and further relief as to the Court may seem just.\nNowhere in the pleadings or in the statement of admitted facts does any suggestion appear that the appellant has failed to comply with any requirement of the Statutes of New Brunswick or the orders made thereunder dealing with the use of the highways, such as, for example, enact\u00adments prescribing the maximum weight and size of buses, the system of brakes or the carrying of insurance; and it appears to me that we must deal with the questions on the assumption that the appellant has fulfilled all the con\u00additions precedent to the granting of whatever licences he requires to permit his buses to use the highways of New Brunswick.\nOn this assumption the only question which properly arises for determination is whether the restriction contained in the licence of the 17th June, 1949, granted by the Motor Carrier Board to, the appellant is effective. In saying this, I have not overlooked the wide terms of paragraph 2 of the prayer for relief in the counterclaim, quoted above, or the fact that the Attorney General for New Brunswick has been added as a party plaintiff nunc pro tune, and may therefore, I assume, be regarded as a defendant in the counterclaim. In my view, in the circumstances of this ease the appellant is not entitled to a declaratory judgment as to what is the law of New Brunswick and as to how far it affects his operations, vide Smith v. Attorney General for Ontario[39]. All the rights of the appellant which are in issue in this action will be sufficiently defined by an answer to the question mentioned in the first sentence of this paragraph, and it is unnecessary to enter upon a discussion of the wider questions of law sought to be raised by the counterclaim.\nI agree with my brother Rand that the relevant statutory provisions, if valid, are broad enough to empower the Board to restrict the licence as it did, and the answer to the question must therefore turn on whether it was within the powers of the legislature of New Brunswick to so provide.\nIn the assumed circumstances of this case, set out above, I am in agreement with those members of the Court who hold that the New Brunswick statutes and regulations in question and the licence issued by the Motor Carrier Board, referred to above, are legally ineffective to, prevent the appellant by his undertaking from bringing passengers into the Province of New Brunswick from the United States of America or from another province of Canada and permitting such passengers to alight in New Brunswick, or from pick\u00ading up passengers in New Brunswick to be carried out of the province or from transporting between points in the province passengers to whom stop-over privileges have been extended as an incident of a contract of through carriage; because in so far as they purport so to do they are ultra vires of the legislature of New Brunswick. I would so declare and would also declare that no further answer to, the questions submitted is required. I would dispose of the costs as proposed by my brother Kerwin.\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2011Pursuant to licences granted by the Motor Carrier Board of the Province of New Brunswick, the respondent, a company incorporated under the laws of the province, operates, within the province only and over certain routes, motor buses for the carriage of passengers and goods for hire.\nThe appellant, a resident of Lewiston, in the State of Maine, conducts like operations between Boston, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the town of Glace Bay, in the Province of Nova Scotia, and between inter-mediate points, including points within the Province of New Brunswick. As to the part of these operations on routes beyond the Canadian border, the appellant holds a permit issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission, a United States federal body having jurisdiction, inter alia, over interstate transportation. With respect to the other part of the operations, carried on routes within the Province of New Brunswick, the appellant did, on the 17th of June, 1949, obtain from the Motor Carrier Board of the province a licence in the following terms:\nIsrael Winner doing business under the name and style of \"MacKenzie Coach Lines\", at Lewiston in the State of Maine, is granted a licence to operate public motor buses from Boston in the State of Massachusetts, through the Province of New Brunswick on Highways Nos. I and 2, to Halifax and Glace Bay in the Province of Nova Scotia and return, but not to embus or de bus passengers in the said province of New Brunswick after August 1, 1949.\nHaving, before the issuance of such a licence, challenged the validity of The Motor Carrier Act, 1937, as amended by 13 Geo. 6, c. 47 (1949), the appellant, thereafter, con\u00adsistently ignored and refused to comply with the restric\u00adtions above underlined in the licence. And he equally declared his intention to continue to do so. until it shall have been judicially found that such operations are pro\u00adhibited by The Motor Carrier Act and amendments thereto, or by any other applicable statute or law. In effect, and under such a licence, the only right granted to the appellant is to go across the Province of New Brunswick with passengers already embussed but with no right to embus or debus passengers in the province.\nThis attitude and these actions of the appellant gave, at first, rise to a claim by the respondent asking for (1) a declaration that the appellant had no legal right to do what his permit prohibited him from doing, (2) an injunc\u00adtion to restrain him from carrying on such operations and (3) damages, and to a counterclaim by the appellant for a declaration that his operations, actual or proposed, being primarily international and interprovincial, came within the purview of sub-s. 10(a) of s. 92 of the British North America Act and, as such, beyond control by provincial legislation related to such undertakings carried on wholly within the province.\nEventually, and in the course of these proceedings, three questions of law having been stated, they were subsequently answered, by the Supreme Court (Appellate Division) of the Province of New Brunswick, in a judgment now before this Court for review.\nThe essential point decisive of the present issue is whether or not, and, if in the affirmative, in what measure, the above described transportation business of the appellant constitutes an undertaking within the meaning of s. 92(10) of the B.N.A, Act and, as such, not only excluded from the provincial legislative field but by force of s. 91, (29) included amongst the classes of subjects exclusively within the legislative authority of Parliament.\nS. 92(10) reads:\n10. Local works and undertakings other than such as are of the follow\u00ading classes:\u2011\n(a) Lines of steam or other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs, and other works and undertakings connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of the province;\n(b) Lines of steam ships between the province and any British or foreign country;\n(c) Such works as, although wholly situate within the province, are before or after their execution declared by the Parliament of Canada to be for the general advantage of Canada or for the advantage of two or more of the provinces.\nThe time table and the index of stations, relative to the appellant's operations, indicate that his bus line extends from New Brunswick into Nova Scotia and into the United States of America. It also shows that it joins points in New Brunswick to points in Nova Scotia.\nIn the light of what was said by Viscount Dunedin in re Regulation and Control of Radio Communication in Canada[40], the conclusion that the operation of the bus line cf the appellant is an undertaking within the meaning of the word in the subsection and that it is an undertaking which connects one province to another, is, with deference, in-escapable.\nThe fact that the highways, over which the motor buses of the appellant must travel, are not part of his undertaking is not more material in the present case than the fact that the space, in which the material transmitted by radio has to travel, was not part of the undertaking, was material in the Radio case. In the judgment of the Judicial Com\u00admittee rendered in the latter, it was stated, at page 315, that \" 'undertaking' is not a physical thing, but is an arrangement under which of course physical things are used.\" And it was also declared that \"the undertaking of broadcasting is an undertaking connecting the province with other provinces and extending beyond the limits of the province.\" On the alleged factual premises that the appellant has no office, no place of business, no organization, no situs in the Province of New Brunswick but only in Lewiston, Maine, it was suggested that his undertaking is not local in the sense of the local undertakings excepted by the subsection, It may be stated, at first, that it appears in the material found in the record, that while what is des\u00adcribed as the \"main office\" of the appellant is situated in Lewiston, Maine, the latter has, equally, agencies at several strategic points on the bus line he operates, particularly in the Provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and that he also maintains one office in Halifax and another in Sydney. I cannot think that the point from which an undertaking is partly or wholly managed or directed may become the decisive element in the consideration of the question. The subsection is not related to the situs of management of the undertaking but to the larger field-the one which may connect-in which the undertaking is actually operated. In each of the two or more provinces covered by an undertaking, it may, with equal accuracy, be said that the undertaking connects the province to the other province or provinces. An interpretation of the sub-section which would make this proposition well-founded only in the province where the undertaking has its origin and situs, and ill-founded in the other province or provinces, would fatally and completely nullify the purpose the sub-section was meant to achieve. For, and assuming that identical legislation would be adopted in all these provinces by local legislative action, such legislation could be declared ultra vires in the province of origin and situs of the under-taking, and intra vires in all the others. In the result, the overall control by legislative and executive action, which, in proper cases, the B.N.A. Act contemplates, would not be achieved. That \"the object of the paragraph\" (10(a)) \"is to deal with means of interprovincial communication\", and that \"Such communication can be provided by organiza\u00adtions or undertakings but not by inanimate things alone\" is affirmed by the judgment of the Judicial Committee in C.P.R. v. A.G. for British Columbia[41]. In the measure in which it is interprovincial, the public transportation service of the appellant undoubtedly con\u00adstitutes consequently an undertaking coming within the meaning of s. 92 (10) (a) and, as such, is within the classes of subjects transferred into s. 91. Thus, the carrying of passengers by the appellant (a) from outside the Province of New Brunswick to points along his route in the province, and (b) from points within the province to points beyond the province, and (c) between points in the province as an incident to stop-over privileges related to the operations mentioned in (a) and (b), having this interprovincial character, comes therefore within dominion jurisdiction as such.\nHowever, and as described at the very beginning of these reasons, the actual and proposed operations of the appel\u00adlant include, in addition to this interprovincial service, the transportation of passengers between intermediate points within the Province of New Brunswick. And the question arises whether this latter traffic, in essence exclusively local, should be dealt with in this case as necessarily incidental to what constitutes the interprovincial undertaking of the appellant, and be thus equally declared to come under the exclusive control of Parliament. I see no reason why it should. In law, it has by itself none of the features which, considered alone, would bring it within the meaning of s. 92(10) (a). In fact, such local transportation is not a necessary incident to the interprovincial service of the appellant. The operations carried on by S.M.T. (Eastern) Ltd., the respondent, sufficiently indicate that such local service is in itself a complete undertaking. It is true that both the interprovincial and local services may merge in one undertaking. This, however, is no reason to ignore the legal premises on which the issue must be determined and, further, to conclude that either the local or the interpro\u00advincial part of the whole service must be considered as a necessary incident of the other. These local operations remain within provincial control.\nThe above conclusions are, in my view, sufficient to dispose of the real issue which arose in this case. There is no need to re-state here all that is said in the other reasons with respect to the difference, in pith and substance, between The Motor Carrier Act and The Motor Vehicle Act of the Province of New Brunswick. In brief, the former is related to the public service of transportation while the latter deals with vehicles and their operations, and the material principle laid down in Provincial Secretary of P.E.I. v. Egan[42], remains unaffected.\nI equally agree with the views that the question related to the nature of the right to the use of a public highway, and the fact that the appellant is an alien, do not affect adversely the above conclusions as to the main issue.\nI would, therefore, agree with my brother Locke as to the answers that should be given.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the reasons of the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick modified accordingly.\nAs to costs, I agree with the order proposed by my brother Kerwin.\nAppeal allowed and Order appealed from set aside.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

Following a preliminary inquiry a grand jury returned a true bill on the indictment. Prior to the swearing of the petit jury appellant's counsel moved to quash on the grounds that the grand jury had examined only one witness and that from the evidence given by him at the preliminary hearing the Crown had failed to establish the identity, ownership or unlawful conversion of the goods, essential elements of the offence charged. In support of the motion Rex v. Court ([2]) was cited and the judgment of Campbell C.J. therein that an indictment found by a grand jury on inadmissible or inadequate material must be quashed. The motion was refused and the trial proceeded with. On the appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal and before this Court the same ground was pressed, as well as misdirection and non-direction by the trial judge.\nD. L. Mathieson K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. O. C. Campbell K.C. for the respondent.\nAt the close of the appellant's argument the Court retired. On its return to the bench, Kerwin J. speaking for the Court stated: It will not be necessary to call on you, Mr. Camp-bell. On the first point we express no opinion on the correctness of the decision in Rex v. Court. It is sufficient to say there is nothing in this case to show that the grand jury did not have before it sufficient evidence to justify it bringing in a true bill. On the other points we are all of opinion that while there were errors in the trial judge's charge to the jury, those errors were immediately corrected upon them being called to the judge's attention by Counsel for the appellant. In the circumstances, it cannot be said that the trial judge did not put before the jury the defence raised on behalf of the appellant.\nThe appeal is, therefore, dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] (1951) 26 M.P.R. 159; 100 C.C.C. 64.\n[2] (1947) 19 M.P.R. 436; 3 D.L.R. 223; 88 Can.

Wilder Appellant;\nThe Minister Of National Revenue Respondent.\n1951: May 5, 9; 1951: December 3.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau, Rand, Kellock and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nRevenue\u2014Income tax\u2014Sale of assets, consideration for which was monthly payments during life of vendor\u2014Whether \"annuity\" within meaning of s. 3(1) (b) of the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97 and amendments.\nThe appellant sold his real estate business together with all its assets, the purchaser assuming all the liabilities of the vendor. One of the considerations for the sale was that the purchaser would pay the vendor an annuity during his lifetime of $1,000 per month.\nThe appellant was assessed for income tax for the years 1941, 1942 and 1943 on the full amount of the monthly payments of $1,000 each, on the ground that that amount was income within the meaning of s. 3(1) (b) of the Income War Tax Act, which provided that \" 'income' means the annual net profit or gain or gratuity \u2026 and also the annual profit or gain from any other source including \u2026 annuities or other annual payments received under the provisions of any contract except as in this Act otherwise provided;\u2026\"\nThese assessments, on appeal, were maintained by the Minister of National Revenue and by the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (Rand and Kellock JJ. dissenting), that the monthly payments were not taxable income within the meaning of s. 3(1) (b) of the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97 and amendments, as they were not an income receipt but instalments due on the purchase price of certain assets. The appellant had bought no annuity subject to income tax. APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Thorson P. 1, affirming the decision of the Minister of National Revenue.\nHarold E. Walker K.C. and Robert H. E. Walker K.C. for the appellant. The payments in question, being payments on account of the purchase price constitute repayments of capital and are not \"annuities or other annual payments\" within s. 3(1) (b) of the Act. There is only one \"source of income\" involved namely the properties sold. There is only one item of \"income\" involved namely the revenue or net revenue from that \"source of income\". The payments constitute the purchase price for the \"source of income\" and not payments for the income. The payments do not become \"annuities\" taxable under s. 3(1) (b) merely because they are payable for the life of the vendor. The test is whether they constitute a return of capital or not. The cases of Foley v. Fletcher 2, Dott v. Brown 3 and Income Tax Case No. 98 4 are relied on.\nThe basic rule or principle of the Income War Tax Act is to tax income and not capital unless where to a limited extent as under s. 3(g) it is expressly declared that capital may be taxed. The certainty or uncertainty of the term is not a factor to be taken into account in the determination of what is and what is not taxable annuity.\nIf there is any doubt as to the liability to the tax, it should be resolved in favour of the taxpayer: Tennant v. Smith 5 and O'Connor v. Minister of National Revenue 6. The question of liability is most ambiguous in the case at bar. Annuities subject to tax are not defined. It has been held and is well established that not all annuities are subject to tax. There is not an inkling in s. 3(b) as to what annuities are to be taxed under that subsection. In every other section or subsection of the Act where annuities are mentioned it is clear from the context that only annuities purchased from the Dominion or Provincial Government or from Insurance companies and annuities created under wills, gifts, trusts or settlements are in contemplation. There is, therefore, some reasons for inferring that the above kinds of annuities were what was contemplated by the 1940 re-enactment of s. 3(b). Before 1940, annuities mentioned in para, (b) referred expressly to insurance annuities. The 1940 amendment is said to have been enacted to \"catch\" payments such as those held not taxable in the case of Shaw v. Minister of National Revenue 7.\nThe payments should not be considered to be taxable annuities merely because they are referred to in the contract of sale as such: O'Connor v. Minister of National Revenue supra, The Secretary of State in Council of India v. Scoble 8 and Perrin v. Dickson 9.\nIt is felt that the payments come rather within the category of payments contemplated in s. 3(2) enacted in 1942 and which appears to have been specially enacted to \"catch\" the interest content of payments, particularly payments on account of the purchase price of property where no interest was stipulated. The enactment in 1942 of s. 3(2) implies recognition that this category of payments existed before and that they were not chargeable as annuities under s. 3(1) (b). If s. 3(1) (b) covers any annual payment then there would be no need for s. 3(2).\nAs to the disposal of the appeal if the Court comes to the conclusion that the assessments should have been made under s. 3(2), the cases of Shaw v. Minister of National Revenue supra and Lumbers v. Minister of National Revenue 10 should be followed on that point. The assessments are good or bad and therefore should be maintained or dismissed and not returned to the Minister. In any event, there would be no tax for the year 1941.\nSubsidiarily, even if the payments were held to be annuities within the purview of s. 3(1) (b), then at the most only the income or interest content should be chargeable with income tax. This submission is based on the construction to be placed on s. 3 of the Act and its members, where it is shown plainly that it is not the gross income that is subject to the tax but only the net income; The net profit or gain to the appellant in the payments due him under the contract is not the total amount of such payments. (Vide Samson v. Minister of National Revenue 11, Shaw v. Minister of National Revenue supra and O'Connor v. Minister of National Revenue supra). It is further submitted that purchased annuities and annuities payable by gratuitous title under a gift, will or settlement are the only kind of annuities that are contemplated in the Act. There is nothing in the Act to justify the inclusion of any other annual payments as coming within the meaning of \"annuities or other annual payments\" mentioned in s. 3(1) (b).\nThe case of Chadwick v. Pearl Life Insurance Co. 12 was also cited.\nPaul Dalm\u00e9 and E. S. MacLatchy for the respondent. The argument that the payments are not an annuity but are in the nature of a return of capital is not novel and has been decided against appellant in the case of Lumbers v. Minister of National Revenue 13. The whole question is what is an \"annuity\": Perrin v. Dickson 14. The payments in the present case are the price of the sale but payable in an \"annuity\" as defined in s. 3(1) (b). The payments are also an \"annuity\" because of the uncertain term and because of the fact that there is no capital to be recovered to the appellant. They cease to be capital and become net profit: Sothern-Smith v. Clancy 15.\nS. 3(2) of the Act was enacted to deal with annual payments not covered by s. 3(1) (b): such as an instalment payment on a capital sum.\nThe case of Dott v. Brown 16 is distinguishable. The South African case 17 cited by the appellant, is the opposite of the case at bar and has no bearing.\nHarold E. Walker K.C. replied.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014On the 6th of February, 1932, James E. Wilder, the appellant, sold to Wilder Norris, Limited, properties consisting of land, buildings, real estate, securities, listed in fourteen schedules appended to an agreement of that date. In effect, Wilder was thus selling his real estate business with all its assets, and as part of the consideration of the sale the purchaser agreed to assume all liabilities of the vendor. One of the considerations for the sale was that the purchaser should \"pay to the vendor as from the first day of December, 1931, an annuity during his lifetime of $1,000 per month\". The appeal is concerned with income tax assessments for the years 1941, 1942 and 1943, in each of which the appellant was assessed for income tax on the full amount of the monthly payments of $1,000 each, aggregating $12,000 per annum. These assessments were the subject of appeals to the Minister of National Revenue and to the Exchequer Court of Canada 18. The assessments were maintained by both the Minister and the Court 19.\nThe decision of the Minister in affirming the assessments was that the amount of $1,000 per month received by the appellant was income within the meaning of paragraph (b) of section (3) of the Act, and that the said sum is not within the exemption provided by paragraph (k) of section (5) of the Act.\nSection 3(b) of The Income War Tax Act, so far as it may be said to apply to the matter, reads thus:\u2014\n3. (1) For the purposes of this Act, \"income\" means the annual net profit or gain or gratuity \u2026 and also the annual profit or gain from any other source including\n(b) annuities or other annual payments received under the provisions of any contract except as in this Act otherwise provided;\u2026\nThe reason given by the appellant for contesting the assessment is that the payments in question, being payments on account of the purchase price of the property sold by the appellant, constitute repayments of capital and are not annuities or other annual payments coming within the purview of section 3(1) (b). Subsidiarily the appellant claims that, if the payments in question come within the purview of that section, at the most only the income or interest content is subject to tax.\nBefore the Exchequer Court 20 the appellant also submitted that if the payments were held to be annuities under section 3(1) (b) they should be entitled to the exemptions provided under section 5(k). At Bar the appellant abandoned this latter contention, so that the present appeal stands to be decided exclusively on the proper construction of section 3(1) (b) and its application to the facts.\nThere can be no doubt that the sum of $1,000 per month payable to the appellant under the agreement of the 6th of February, 1932 (being the sale to Wilder Norris, Ltd.) is part of the purchase price and in essence, therefore, capital payment. Of course, section 3(1) (b) must be Minister understood and interpreted as being part of section 3. That section clearly defines income \"for the purposes of this Act\" as meaning \"the annual net profit or gain\". It may be wages, salary, or other fixed amount, or fees or emoluments, or profits from a trade or commercial or financial or other business or calling, as the case may be, whether derived from sources within Canada or elsewhere. It shall include the interest, dividends or profits directly or indirectly received from money at interest upon any security or without security, or from stocks, or from any other investment, and, whether such gains or profits are divided or distributed or not; and also \"the annual profit or gain from any other source including\", after which there is subsection (b) as above quoted. It seems to me clear, therefore, that what the section aims at as being income is the annual profit or gain.\nIt is obvious that the annual payments stipulated in favour of the appellant in the present instance cannot be described as annual profit or gain, and that on the proper construction of section (3) (1) (b) an annuity or annual payment, received under the provisions of a contract, such as the present one, in order to be taxable must be an annual profit or gain. The whole economy of section (3)\u2014 and for that matter all of the Income War Tax Act\u2014is that it taxes income and not capital. This view is further supported by subsection (2) of section (3) whereby if the Minister is of opinion that under any existing or future contract or arrangement for the payment of money, payments of principal money and interest are blended or payment is made pursuant to a plan which involves an allowance of interest, \"whether or not there is any provision for payment of interest at a nominal rate or at all, the Minister shall have the power to determine what part of any such payment is interest and the part so determined to be interest shall be deemed to be income for the purposes of this Act\". This was not done in the present case and the decision of the Minister is not based on that subsection.\nIn my view the true construction to be given to section (3) (1) (b) is that the annual profit or gain derived from the source of annuities or other annual payments is taxable income, but that the annuity, or other annual payment, received under the provisions of a contract, if the Minister has not expressed the opinion that some interest was blended with principal money, is not taxable under section (3) (1) (b).\nI have no doubt that Parliament could declare to be income an annuity or annual payment which represents capital money, but, in my opinion, Parliament has not done so.\nAs was said by Chief Justice Sir Lyman Duff in Shaw v. Minister of National Revenue 21:\nThe legislature, it seems to me, is at pains to emphasize the distinction between income and the source of income. The income derived from the capital source is income for the purposes of the Act. The source is not income for the purposes of the Act.\nI do not think the decision in Lumbers v. Minister of National Revenue 22, has the effect of departing from that reasoning.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs both here and in the Exchequer Court.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nTaschereau J.:\u2014On the 6th of February, 1932, the appellant sold to Wilder Norris Limited certain assets for the following consideration:\u2014\n1. The assumption by the purchaser of all existing debts, liabilities, contracts and engagements of the appellant;\n2. The sum of $10,000 in cash;\n3. The sum of $1,000,000 in debentures of the purchaser;\n4. $100,000 by the allotment to the appellant or his nominees of certain shares of the company;\n5. The obligation by the purchaser to pay to the vendor as and from the first day of December, 1931, an annuity during his lifetime of $1,000 per month, and of $75 per month to Mrs. F. E. Puffer.\nIn the years 1941, 1942, 1943, the appellant was assessed for income tax on the full amount of the monthly payments of $1,000 each, aggregating $12,000 per annum. The assessments were the subject of appeals to the Minister of National Revenue and to the Exchequer Court of Canada 23. They were maintained by both the Minister and the Exchequer Court, hence the present appeal to this Court.\nIt is the appellant's submission for contesting the assessments, that the payments in question, although referred to as \"annuities\" in the deed of sale, are payments on account of the purchase price, and are not \"annuities or other annual payments\", coming within the purview of section 3(1) (b) of the Income Tax Act.\nThe Act defines as follows \"taxable income\":\u2014\n3.(1) For the purposes of this Act, \"income\" means the annual net profit or gain or gratuity, whether ascertained and capable of computation as being wages, salary, or other fixed amount, or unascertained as being fees or emoluments, or as being profits from a trade or commercial or financial or other business or calling, directly or indirectly received by a person from any office or employment, or from any profession or calling, or from any trade, manufacture or business, as the case may be whether derived from sources within Canada or elsewhere; and shall include the interest, dividends or profits directly or indirectly received from money at interest upon any security or without security, or from stocks, or from any other investment, and, whether such gains or profits are divided or distributed or not, and also the annual profit or gain from any other source including\n(a) the income from but not the value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise or descent; and\n(b) annuities or other annual payments received under the provisions of any contract except as in this Act otherwise provided;\nThe word \"annuity\", is not defined in the Act, but the reading of section 3(1) (b) with other sections of the same Act, would seem to indicate that the whole scheme of the law is undoubtedly to tax profits or gains, and not capital. When Parliament intended to tax capital, it has clearly said so. Section 3(1) (g) is for instance an example of such an intention. It reads as follows:\u2014\n3. (1)\n(g) annuities or other annual payments received under the provisions of any will or trust, irrespective of the date on which such will or trust became effective, and notwithstanding that the annuity or annual payments are in whole or in part paid out of capital funds of the estate or trust and whether the same is received in periods longer or shorter than one year;\nIt would have been useless for Parliament to say that \"annuities or other annual payments received under the provisions of a will, even if paid out of capital funds\", were taxable, if all these payments were already considered as \"income\" by virtue of section 3(1) (b).\nFurthermore, section 3(2) shows that \"annual payments\" which are \"capital\" are excluded from the field of taxation. It says:\u2014\n(2) Where under any existing or future contract or arrangement for the payment of money, the Minister is of opinion that\n(a) payments of principal money and interest are blended, or\n(b) payment is made pursuant to a plan which involves an allowance of interest;\nwhether or not there is any provision for payment of interest at a nominal rate or at all, the Minister shall have the power to determine what part of any such payment is interest and the part so determined to be interest shall be deemed to be income for the purposes of this Act.\nIf the respondent is right in his contention, we would have to come to the illogical conclusion that, when in an annual payment, capital and interest are blended, only that part of the payment which is interest may be taxable, and that a payment representing only capital, as in the present instance, would be taxable in toto.\nThe respondent relied on Lumbers v. Minister of National Revenue 24. In this case, Lumbers had entered into a contract with an insurance company which entitled him, after paying premiums for twenty years, to receive, at his option, either a lump sum, or monthly payments during his lifetime with the payments going thereafter to his wife, if surviving him, during her lifetime, and with a guaranteed period of payment for twenty years. During the payment of the premiums the contract constituted a policy of insurance, and upon Lumbers' death, the monthly sums would become payable to his wife, if then living, for her lifetime, with the same guarantee of twenty years. After paying the premiums for twenty years, Lumbers elected to receive the monthly payments, and it was held that these monthly payments were \"annuities\", and therefore taxable.\nI do not think that this decision is an authority for the determination of the present case. The \"annuities\" payable by an insurance company, in order to be exempt from taxation, must be derived from an annuity contract which was \"like\" annuity contracts issued by the Dominion or a Province. The contract in the Lumbers case was not a \"like\" contract as required. Furthermore, in view of section 3(1) (b) of the Act, it was held that the taxation of the annuities paid, was not objectionable on the ground that they were of the nature of a return of capital.\nIn the present case, we are not dealing with an annuity or an income bought with a sum of money, and of which the annuitant is the purchaser, but we are dealing with instalments due on the purchase price of certain assets. The appellant has bought no annuity subject to income tax.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and below.\nRand J. (dissenting):\u2014This appeal raises the question of the distinction between \"annuities or other annual payments received under the provisions of any contract except as in this Act otherwise provided\" within s. 3(1) (b) of the Income Tax Act, and instalment payments of capital or of capital and income combined; and it is to be determined by ascertaining the real nature of the payment from the standpoint of the person receiving it.\nPerhaps the most familiar use of the word \"annuity\" envisages the payment of one or more sums of money in return for which an obligation is undertaken to pay an annual or other periodic sum during the lifetime of the purchaser. In that case, the purchase money is properly looked upon as having disappeared, and the annual payments, notwithstanding that they are actually or theoretically built up of the capital and accumulated interest, as neither a return nor a conversion of the money advanced but as income. This idea of \"disappearance\" is significant in being notional, for as Lord Greene in Sothern-Smith v. Clancy 25, points out, the payment of money or the transfer of property as consideration for a series of payments \"disappears\" in every case so far as the person making it is concerned: but the notion of its disappearance is nevetheless relevant to the issue, because it determines the aspect in which the payments are viewed and because it is the manner in which people uniformly and habitually view them that gives rise to the conceptions which underlie the legislation.\nThat transaction, as a clear example of annuity, on the one hand, is to be contrasted with the sale of land for a price to be paid by equal portions, on the other. In this the vendor views the receipt of instalments, to use the language of Rowlatt J. in Perrin v. Dickson 26, as \"liquidating a principal sum\", the price, and that is so even though title has passed and all that remains is the obligation: there is the conception of a conversion of capital from land to money or the payment of a debt. These relatively simple transactions have become complicated by variations in the term and by the introduction of conditions and modifications of the obligation to the extent that they present questions of some difficulty in allocating them to the one or other classification.\nThe statute does not observe all the possible refinements to which logically that primary contrast could give rise. There is scarcely any form of the receipt of money paid in return for a consideration, which, if we look at its financial facts, could not fairly be argued to possess some increment of returned capital: and there are taxable items under the statute which undoubtedly do that. S. 3(1) (b) provides broadly that \"annual payments\" are to be deemed to be income except as the Act otherwise provides: but the Act is designed primarily to tax \"income\" and the exclusion of the receipt of capital generally is basic. Subject, then, to its clear specifications, we should, in the differentiation of annual payments, act upon the common acceptation of these words held in the business world.\nIn the facts before us, the payments of $1,000 a month for fife are part of the consideration for the sale by the taxpayer of a large business to a company, but they relate to no specific portion of the price, and when received, they are not taken as discharging pro tanto any notional, much less, any measured amount of capital. Nor is the total amount to be paid certain; it may be small or large, depending on the uncertain life of the taxpayer.\nThe question has been elucidated by the recent decision of the Court of Appeal of England, in Sothern-Smith, supra. There a life assurance society, in consideration of a specified sum of money agreed to pay to the purchaser a fixed annuity during his life with the added provision that if during that time the payments did not aggregate the sum paid by him, they would continue to his sister until that sum had been reached: in other words, the contract was to pay an annual sum for an ascertainable period of years or for the. period of the life of the purchaser, whichever might Prove to be the longer. It was argued that the purchase price continued to persist as a guaranteed return, and that the payments to the sister partook, consequently, of the nature of capital. This contention was rejected. In speaking of an annuity for a term of years and pointing the distinction between that and a life annuity, namely, that in the latter the sum of the payments which fall to be made may be less or greater than the amount paid by the annuitant while in the former it would be the same as that amount plus an addition for interest, Lord Greene, at page 7, observes:\u2014\nI feel bound to regard the purchase of an annuity of the kind to which I have referred as the purchase of an income and the whole of the income so purchased as a profit or gain notwithstanding the way in which the payments are calculated. The sum paid for the annuity has ceased to have any existence and the fact that at the end of the annuity period the recipient will have received an amount equal at least to what he paid I feel bound to treat as irrelevant.\nA fortiori, would that reasoning apply to the case of a life annuity as we have it here.\nIt is then contended that the definition of income in s. 3 makes it clear that when income is associated with capital in a payment only the former is intended to be brought under the charge. It is then assumed that necessarily some part of these annual payments are of a capital nature and to that extent are beyond the tax. The difficulty here is that there is no agreed capital element and we are not at liberty in any manner to capitalize the payments. Under the contract, cash, debentures, shares of stock and two annuities constituted the purchase price. That a person may bargain for a life annuity as part of the consideration for the sale of property, whether or not it is referable to a specific portion of the price, is, I think, unquestionable, and that, in my opinion, is what was done here.\nIt was argued that the case is governed by Shaw v. The Minister of National Revenue 27. But the language of s. 3(1) (b), as it then was, specifically excluded \"payments made or credited to the insured on life insurance, endowment or annuity contracts upon the maturity of the term mentioned in the contract or upon the surrender of the contract.\" The payments there, under an insurance policy, were directly within that language. Since that decision, the section has been amended to its present form.\nIt is finally contended that the case falls within subsection (2) of section 3 which provides:\u2014\n(2) Where under any existing or future contract or arrangement for the payment of money, the Minister is of opinion that\n(a) payments of principal money and interest are blended, or\n(b) payment is made pursuant to a plan which involves an allowance of interest;\nwhether or not there is any provision for payment of interest at a nominal rate or at all, the Minister shall have the power to determine what part of any such payment is interest and the part so determined to be interest shall be deemed to be income for the purposes of this Act.\nThe facts of the case as well as the reasoning on which Sothern-Smith is based, are, I think, a complete answer to this contention. There is nothing in the agreement on which the Minister could find that payments of principal and interest are blended or that there is any plan which involves an allowance of interest; the annuity is one of a number of items together making up a total price not expressed in a specific amount of money. It is not intended certainly, that every annuity is to be dealt with under that subsection, but that would seem to me necessarily to follow if the present case were held to be within it.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKellock J. (dissenting):\u2014This appeal raises the question as to whether or not the \"annuity\" of $1,000 per month received by the appellant under the provisions of the agreement of sale of the 6th of February 1932 here in question, constitutes an annuity within the meaning of s. 3(1) (b) of the Income War Tax Act as it stood with respect to the taxation years 1941, 1942 and 1943.\nThe agreement provides for the sale by the appellant to Wilder Norris Limited of a substantial list of assets, the consideration being (1) the assumption by the purchaser of all existing debts, liabilities, contracts and engagements of the appellant; (2) the sum of $10,000 in cash; (3) the sum of $1,000,000 in debentures of the purchaser; (4) $100,000 by the allotment to the appellant or his nominees of certain shares of the company; and (5) the following:\n(b)To pay to the Vendor as and from the first day of December 1931 an annuity during his lifetime of $1,000 per month;\n(c) To pay to Mrs. F. E. Puffer, of the City of Montreal, as and from the first day of December 1931, an annuity during her lifetime of $75 per month;\nSection 3 of the statute defines income, so far as material, as\nThe annual profit or gain from any other source, including \u2026\n(b) annuities or other annual payments received under the provisions of any contract \u2026\nIn Lumbers v. Minister of National Revenue 28, Hudson J. refers to the difference between the present form of the paragraph and its form at the time judgment in Shaw v. Minister of National Revenue 29 was given. In his view, and he gave the judgment of the majority of the court, the annuities or other annual payments covered by the paragraph are themselves to be regarded as income, rather than sources from which income may be derived. The question remains, however, as to what is included within the word \"annuities\" as used in the statute.\nIt is past question that the statutory definition was not intended to include everything in the nature of \"annual payments\". For example, annual instalments of the purchase price on the sale of property could not be regarded as income without very plain words, and there are no such words. \"Other annual payments\" is, I think, to be read ejusdem generis with \"annuities,\" and if so, the word \"annuities\" would appear to be used with respect to payments of an income nature. This view is confirmed upon consideration of paragraph (g) of the. same subsection which provides that annuities or other annual payments received under the provisions of any estate or trust are taxable \"notwithstanding that the annuities or annual payments are in whole or in part paid out of capital funds.\" If \"annuities\" simpliciter were taxable, the qualifying words in the paragraph would be unnecessary.\nIn Lady Foley v. Fletcher 30, the House of Lords interpreted the words \"any annuity or other annual payment \u2026 by virtue of any contract\" in s. 40 of 16 Vict. c. 34 by reference to schedule D of that statute which used the following language: \"and for and in respect of all interest of money, annuities and other annual profits or gains,\" and it was held that the section applied only where the annual payment was in the nature of a profit. In the course of his judgment, Baron Watson said at p. 784:\nBut an annuity means where the income is purchased with a sum of money, and the capital is given and has ceased to exist, the principal having been converted into an annuity.\nThis definition has never been departed from in England.\nIt is perfectly clear upon the authorities that, merely because a payment is described as an annuity, the question as to whether it is to be regarded as capital or income is not thereby concluded. The question in every case is only to be determined upon a careful analysis of the particular contract. In such analysis, the assistance to be gained from the decided cases is thus expressed by Lord Green M.R., as he then was, in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. 36\/49 Holdings Limited (in Liquidation) 31:\nIn so far as, in the cases which have been decided, certain of those circumstances have been regarded as of importance, the authorities no doubt are of assistance, because they at any rate go as far as this: They say that elements such as those are elements which may legitimately be taken into consideration; but when you come down to an individual case, taking such guidance as you can on that basis from the authorities and any general expression of principle, the matter must be decided by reference to the circumstances of the particular case.\nAt p. 182 he had said:\nThe true nature of the sum is not necessarily its nature in law, but its nature in business or in accountancy whichever way one like to put it, because from the legal point of view there may be no difference whatsoever as between the parties between a capital and an income sum. It may be totally irrelevant to the legal relationships into which they are proposing to enter.\nI therefore turn to a consideration of the authorities.\nIn Secretary of State v. Scoble 32, the appellant, having the right, under the contract there in question, to purchase a railway for the value of all the shares of the company, had also the option, instead of paying the gross amount in one sum, of discharging his liability by the payment, for a certain number of years, of an \"annuity\", the annual payments being calculated with respect to the gross sum and interest at a specific rate. This option was exercised and it was held that these annual payments were composed in part of capital and in part of interest, the interest content of each alone being taxable. As expressed by Lord Davey, the one important fact which determined the case was that for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of the so-called annuity, the gross sum payable by the appellant had to be ascertained.\nThe fact, however, that the purchase price may not, in any given case, be definitely fixed for all purposes by the terms of the contract, does not necessarily indicate that the annual payments are not to be regarded as capital payments. This is well illustrated by the decision in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Ramsay 33. In that case, the respondent agreed to purchase a dental practice for a \"primary price\" of \u00a315,000. \u00a35,000 was to be paid down, and for a period of ten years the purchaser, who was to carry on the practice, would pay the vendor annually a sum equal to 25 per cent of the net profits. Such payments were to constitute full payment of the balance, regardless of whether they should amount to more or less than \u00a310,000. \u00a35,000 of this balance was to be secured by a charge upon a policy of life insurance on the life of the purchaser, and it was also provided that if the purchaser should die before the expiration of the full period of ten years, the vendor should accept the proceeds of the policy and the annual payments up to that time, in full discharge of all liability under the contract. It was held by the Court of Appeal that the annual payments were capital and not subject to tax. In the course of his judgment, Lord Wright M.R. pointed out that the mere statement in the contract itself that the annual payments should be paid and received as capital sums paid in respect of the \"purchase price\" was not conclusive of anything. Whether or not they were capital sums had to be determined by a consideration of the substance of the transaction. He approved of the statement of principle laid down by Walton J. in Chadunck v. Pearl Life Insurance Company 34, as follows:\nIt is obvious that there will be cases in which it will be very difficult to distinguish between an agreement to pay a debt by instalments, and an agreement for good consideration to make certain annual payments for a fixed number of years. In the one case there is an agreement for good consideration to pay a fixed gross amount and to pay it by instalments; in the other there is an agreement for good consideration not to pay any fixed gross amount, but to make a certain, or it may be an uncertain, number of annual payments. The distinction is a fine one, and seems to depend on whether the agreement between the parties involves an obligation to pay a fixed gross sum.\nIn Ramsay's case, the essence of the contract was that It contained a code which, if it operated during the whole ten years, would have the result that the remaining debt of \u00a310,000 would be discharged by payment of a number of instalments which might amount to either more or less than that sum. Lord Wright said that he could not see why a creditor who has sold property \"for a particular price\" should not, in discharge of that price, agree to accept a fluctuating sum if there are sufficient reasons of convenience or other considerations which make it desirable to adopt that method of payment. In his Lordship's view, the purchase price of \u00a315,000 was\nA figure which permeates the whole of the contract and upon which the whole contract depends.\nHe therefore thought that the payments in discharge of that sum were all capital payments.\nGreene L.J., as he then was, points out that the argument for the respondent was based upon the view that the sum of \u00a315,000 mentioned in the contract had no real existence at all, in the sense that the contract would be exactly the same if all reference to that sum had been omitted. Greene L.J. rejected that argument, being of the view that, upon the contract, the primary obligation was to pay that sum which would only be varied in the events mentioned in the contract.\nIt has also been held that, merely because the annuity or annual payments constitute part of the price or consideration of a contract does not stamp them as capital payments.\nRowlatt J., in Jones v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue 35, a case of a contract providing for the payment of a \"royalty\" on the sale of certain inventions, said at p. 714:\nIt has been urged by Mr. Latter that the annual payment now in question being 10 per cent upon the sales of machines for ten years is part of the consideration which was paid for the transfer from the appellant of his property. So it is, but there is no law of nature or any invariable principle that because it can be said that a certain payment is consideration for the transfer of property it must be looked upon as price in the character of principal. In each case, regard must be had to what the sum is. A man may sell his property for a sum which is to be paid in instalments, and when that is the case the payments to him are not income; Foley v. Fietcher, 3 H. & N. 769. Or a man may sell his property for an annuity. In that case the Income Tax Act applies. Again, a man may sell his property for what looks like an annuity, but which can be seen to be not a transmutation of a principal sum into an annuity but is in fact a principal sum payment of which is being spread over a period and is being paid with interest calculated in a way familiar to actuaries\u2014in such a case income tax is not payable on what is really capital: Secretary of State for India v. Scoble (1903) A.C. 299.\nThere are cases, again, which illustrate that in a particular contract, the consideration on the sale of property may consist in part of capital items and in part of income items, and it is necessary, as in other cases, to ascertain where the line is to be drawn.\nIn the 36\/49 Holdings Limited case, ubi cit., Lord Greene said at p. 183:\nNow it is plain to my mind that where you have a purchase consideration built up in that way, the fact that some of the elements are of a capital nature does not the least bit point to the periodical payments being also of a capital nature. Then again there are cases in the books where the two elements in the purchase price have appeared, one of a capital nature and one of an income nature. The presence, therefore, of these elements of a capital nature here does not in any way assist me in the problem in which I am engaged.\nIn East India Railway Company v. Secretary of State 36, the contract was similar to that in question in Scoble's case except that it provided, as to one-fifth of the capital of the vendor company, that the Secretary of State might arrange with the company that these shareholders, called \"deferred annuitants,\" should receive, for a period determinable by the Secretary, interest at 4 per cent per annum on their interest in the capital, and in addition one-fifth of the net profits of the railway, instead of the annual payment of capital and interest to be received by the remaining shareholders. The contract provided that on termination, the deferred annuitants should thenceforth receive the annual payments on the same basis as the other shareholders. It was held that no part of the deferred annuities represented repayment of capital, but that under the arrangement, part of the capital of the annuitants had been used to purchase the right to the interest and profits which they had received. With respect to these shareholders, the consideration was made up in part of payments composed purely of an income nature, namely, interest and profits, and latterly of annual payments composed, as in Scoble's case, of both capital and interest.\nIn the case already referred to, 36\/49 Holdings Limited, the respondent company had sold certain shares belonging to it in another company for a consideration composed of various items including certain sums in respect of each machine which should be sold by the company whose shares formed the subject matter of the contract.\nNoting that the payments in question were to be perpetual unless the right given by the contract to commute them were exercised, Lord Greene thought it very difficult to class a perpetual payment under the category of capital, and he added:\nThe length of time during which a payment is to endure may be a very important factor in determining its character. It is obviously much easier to treat a payment which is only going to extend over two years as really a payment of purchase price by instalments, than it is to treat a payment which it is contemplated may continue in perpetuity.\nHe also observed that the sums payable under the subparagraph of the contract with which he was dealing were\nnot tied in any way or related in any way to any special sum whatsoever.\nIn the case at bar, there is no gross sum mentioned or ascertainable, and the two annuities are not in any way related to any such amount. The annuities are periodic payments, indefinite in number. In my opinion, the present case is essentially of the same nature as the East India Railway Company case, where part of the appellant's capital was, on the sale of his assets, used to purchase an income of $1,000 per month, the capital itself ceasing to exist, being converted into an annuity. I do not think it could be suggested, as to the annuity payable to Mrs. Puffer, that the situation was any other than that part of the appellant's capital had been used to purchase an income for her, and there are no indicia, in my opinion, which can properly lead to a different view with respect to the annuity payable to the appellant himself.\nThe appellant relies upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in Dott v. Brown 37. The contract in that case provided for the settlement of a debt due from the respondent to the appellant of about \u00a310,000, which had been the subject of proceedings in bankruptcy, a compromise having been arrived at which was made an order of the court. Under this compromise, the petitioner agreed to accept \"in full satisfaction of his judgment debt\" various considerations including items undoubtedly of a capital nature and also the Particular item in question, namely, the covenant of the debtor to pay certain annual sums as long as the petitioner should live. In the view of Lord Roche, the stipulation of the petitioner that the plaintiff was \"to accept in full satisfaction of his judgment debt\" was language applicable to the acceptance of a sum short of the full sum rather than to any contemplated sum larger than the judgment debt being received. Lord Roche was of opinion that it would have been open to the defendant, if he had thought fit, to offer evidence on this point as well as other points as to the surrounding circumstances, to remove, this natural inference from the document. No such evidence, was offered, and for that reason the prima facie construction remained. This circumstance immediately places the case in the category of those to which I have referred in which, in the words of Lord Greene, the repayments were \"tied in\" to a capital sum. In the case at bar, this element is entirely lacking.\nFurther, the covenant in Dott v. Brown was contained in a single clause by which the debtor was \"to pay \u00a31,000 on the 31st of March, 1933, \u00a31,000 on the 31st of March, 1934, and \u00a3250 on each succeeding 31st of March so long as the petitioner should live.\" Scott L.J. in coming to the conclusion that the annual payments of \u00a3250 were capital payments, was influenced by the fact that, in his view, the two annual payments of \u00a31,000 were clearly capital, and it was to be assumed that the payments of \u00a3250, being contained in the same clause, were also capital payments in the absence of some reason to the contrary. That this conclusion was not based upon the view that because one finds included in the consideration in a contract, capital items, that fact is of assistance in arriving at the conclusion that other items are also capital, is borne out by the judgment of the learned Lord Justice himself in the 36\/49 Holdings Limited case, where he agreed with the judgment of the Master of the Rolls to which I have already referred on this point. The circumstance to which Scott L.J. attached importance in Brown\u2019s case is not present in the case at bar which, for the reasons given, is, in my opinion, quite distinguishable from that case.\nThere was no objection taken on the part of the appellant upon the ground that the payments in the present case are monthly payments. That point is, in any event, concluded by the decisions in In Re Cooper [ 88 L. Jo. Ch. 195. ] and In Re Janes\u2019 Settlement [ (1918) 2 ch. 54. ], both of which have been approved by the Court of Appeal in Smith v. Smith [ [1923] P. 191. ], and I would adopt the reasoning in these judgments.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Walker, Martineau, Chauvin, Walker and Allison.\nSolicitors for the respondent: E.S.

The action was dismissed in the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nHeld (Locke J. dissenting), that the judgment appealed from be affirmed and the appeal dismissed, since there was no anticipation and since the patent in suit contributed substantially to the solution of the problem of breakage and did involve the taking of an inventive step which the respondent was the first to take. Per Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: In an invention which consists in a combination as in the present case, it matters not whether the elements thereof are old and were already known in the art as separate entities, the only point is whether the actual combination is new. The invention lies in the particular combination, provided it is not a mere aggregation or a juxtaposition of known contrivances.\nWhether there is invention in a new thing is a question of fact for the judgment of whatever tribunal has the duty of deciding.\nEx post facto analysis of an invention is unfair to the inventors and is not countenanced by the patent law.\nBaldwin International Radio Co. of Canada Ltd. v. Western Electric Co. [1934] S.C.R. 94; Samuel Parkes & Co. v. Cocker Bros. 46 R.P.C. 241; British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. Braulik 27 R.P.C. 209 and Non-Drip Measure Co. Ltd. v. Stranger's Ltd. 60 R.P.C. 135 referred to.\nPer Locke J. (dissenting): Since the essence of the alleged invention as disclosed by the evidence lay not in attaching the temple supporting arm to the lens edge engaging portion or shoe of the strap, but rather to the nose-engaging, means at the point where the strap was soldered to it, for the very purpose described in the specification of transferring any pressure from the temples to the nose-engaging means and the bridge; and since, having regard to the common knowledge in the art at the time of the alleged invention, there was nothing new in such a construction or in any of the parts or in the idea, the relief claimed should be granted.\nThe slight change made from the prior disclosure by Savoie in securing the temple-bow holder to the strap by solder rather than to the ear of the strap by a screw, did not involve the exercise of the inventive faculties; the commercial success of the mounting, although extensive, cannot be regarded as in any sense conclusive on the question in view of the evidence of the lack of invention.\nNatural Colour Kinematograph v. Bioschemes Ltd. 32 R.P.C. 256; Pugh v. Riley Cycle Co. 31 R.P.C. 266; Pope Appliance Corp. v. Spanish River Pulp and Paper Mills [1929] A.C. 269; Crosley Radio Corp. v. Canadian General Electric Co. [1936] S.C.R. 551; Vanity Fair Silk Mills v. Commissioner of Patents [1939] S.C.R. 245 and Longbottom v. Shaw 8 R.P.C. 333 referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Thorson P. 1, dismissing the Crown's action for a declaration of invalidity of the respondent's patent 381,380.\nE. G. Gowling K.C. and G. F. Henderson for the appellant. The patent in suit is attacked on the grounds of anticipation, lack of subject matter and ambiguity.\nIn construing the prior document to determine if it constitutes an anticipation, the Court has regard to the effect of the disclosure upon one skilled in the art namely one who is deemed to be familiar with the common knowledge 1951 in the art: King Brown & Co. v. The Anglo American Brush Corp. 2 and Gillette Safety Razor Co. v. Anglo American Trading Co. 3. The case of Rice v. Christiani 4 is also relied upon.\nThe prior publication must disclose invention claimed to the extent that the skilled technician faced with the problem, would find the answer obvious from examining the document: Electric and Musical Industries Ltd. 5. A drawing alone can constitute an anticipatory document.\nThe claim here is invalid since there is something old within it and since it is not a combination patent within the case of Baldwin International Radio v. Western Electric 6. The cases of Smith Incubator Co. v. Seiling 7 and The King v. Smith Incubator 8 are also relied upon.\nIt is not essential that the same problem be envisaged in the anticipatory document. It is critical that the construction has been disclosed to and is open to the public to use: John Summers & Sons Ltd. v. The Cold Metal Process Co. 9.\nApplying the foregoing principles, it is submitted that the claims of the patent in suit are anticipated by Stevens U.S. patent 953,304, Savoie U.S. patent 988,666 and Nerney U.S. patents 1,984,541 and 1,987,701.\nEven if the prior documents should not be found to constitute an anticipation or a disclosure of the invention, the degree of advance in the art made by the patentee over the disclosures cannot constitute invention. Any difference is in the matter of non-essentials structurally and functionally. Every advance over the prior disclosures cannot constitute invention or the grant of the patent monopoly would arrest rather than encourage development in the arts and science: British Ore Concentration Syndicate Ltd. v. Minerals Separation Ltd. 10. The cases of Vanity Fair Silk Mills v. Commissioner of Patents 11 and Crosley Radio Corp. v. Canadian General Electric Co. Ltd. 12 are relied on as cases dealing with advances which did not constitute patentable advance over the prior publication. All the advantages flowing from the alleged invention resulted from features which were old in the art. All that the inventor did was to make a non-essential contribution. The principle enunciated in Clyde Nail Co. v. Rusesll 13 is applicable. Reliance is also placed on the case of Morgan & Co. v. Windover & Co. 14.\nTo the extent that there is a diversity between the claims of the patent in suit and the prior art, it is merely one of form which does not constitute an advance in the art to warrant the grant of a valid patent: Mauck v. Dominion Chain Co. Ltd. 15. Similarly if the change over the prior art is purely a matter of design, no invention has resulted: Safveans Aktie Bodag v. Ford Motor Co. 16 and Wood v. Raphael 17.\nIt is therefore submitted that the claims of the patent in suit fail to disclose a patentable advance over the Stevens, Savoie and Nerney patents.\nIt is further submitted that the patent in suit did not lead to an unexpected result or the solution of a long existent problem. There was no evidence of the existence of a problem. Rather than the satisfaction of a long felt want, the patent in suit merely constituted a style change accepted by the public for reasons of commerce rather than invention.\nThe trial judge placed too much weight on the commercial success of the mounting. The success of the mounting was attributable to causes other than the invention. The case of Niagara Wire Weaving Co. Ltd. v. Johnson Wire Works Ltd. 18 is relied on. The case of Western Electric Co. v. Baldwin International Radio 19 at page 595 is relied on to show the danger of looking at the evidence of witnesses on the article in the market rather than looking at the specifications and claims.\nThe term \"lens edge engaging portion of the strap\" is ambiguous. It is not defined in the patent. There is no evidence that the phrase has any technical meaning to any one skilled in the art. It would appear to have been a phrase chosen by the inventor and should, therefore, have been defined with precision by him, if it constitutes the 1951 essence of the invention as defined by the trial judge. Uncertainty relating to the meaning of the phrase is particularly objectionable since it relates to the very essence of the invention as found by the trial judge. Moreover, it is an obscurity that could easily have been avoided by a more precise description in the specification. In the circumstances, the principle of the decision in Unifloc Reagents Ld. v. Newstead Colliery Ld. 20 is applicable. There is an obligation upon the inventor to provide the public with the subject matter of his advance in the art without avoidable obscurity: Natural Colour Kinematograph Co. Ld. v. Bioschemes Ld. 21.\nChristopher Robinson K.C. and Rusesll S. Smart for the respondent. Considered by the tests in Canadian General Electric v. Fada 22 and Pope Appliance Corp. v. Spanish River Pulp and Paper Mills 23, none of the prior patents or publications is an anticipation of the invention covered by the patent in suit.\nAs to the propriety of looking at prior patents, the cases of Non-Drip Measure Co. v. Strangers 24 and Fiberglas Canada Ltd. v. Spun Rock Woods 25 are cited.\nHaving regard to the findings of fact by the trial judge, which are fully supported by the evidence, the respondent submits that this case is similar to the cases of Non-Drip Measure Co. v. Strangers (supra) and Samuel Parkes & Co. 1. Cocker Bros. 26, and that the mounting of the patent in suit was no mere workshop improvement which was obvious to any workman faced with the problems of the old rimless mountings, but was, on the contrary, an invention.\nThere was a problem and the existence of that problem plus the commercial success is a strong evidence of an invention: Longbottom v. Shaw 27, Howaldt v. Condrup Ltd. 28, Albert Wood and Amcolite Ltd. v. Gowshall Ltd. 29 and John Wright and Eagle Range Ltd. v. General Gas Appliances Ltd. 30. There is no ambiguity in the expression \"lens edge engaging portion\". It means the base edge of the U.\nIt is a combination invention and not a new invention in the sense that there are no new parts.\nE. G. Gowling K.C. replied.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014This action was instituted under the provisions of Section 60 of The Patent Act, S. of C. 1935, c. 32. The information of the Attorney-General of Canada sought to impeach patents 381,380 and 392,449 as well as industrial design registration 58\/12138; but the respondent withdrew its defence in respect of patent 392,449 and the industrial design, so that the trial of this appeal relates only to the validity of patent 381,380.\nThe disclosure of the nature of the invention of the respondent and of the best mode of realizing the advantages thereof is expressed as follows in the specification:\nMy invention relates to eyeglasses, and more specifically it relates to a mounting means for the temple.\nOne of the objects of my invention is to provide an improved temple mounting which prevents strain from being transmitted to the lenses.\nA further object of my invention is to provide a temple mounting that requires a minimum amount of labor in attaching the mounting.\nA further object of my invention is to provide an improved temple mounting which will be inconspicuous in appearance.\nA further object of my invention is to provide an improved temple mounting which will result in a saving of material.\nThe attacks made on the patent are its lack of novelty (sometimes called anticipation) and lack of invention (usually referred to as lack of subject matter), and the conclusions of the information were that the letters patent be declared invalid or void and that the same be cancelled and set aside.\nThe specification is dated the 28th day of February, 1938, and the patent was granted to William R. Uhlemann on the 16th day of May, 1939. It was subsequently assigned to the respondent.\nThe learned President of the Exchequer Court 31 dismissed, with costs, the appellant's action for a declaration of invalidity. The learned President arrived at the conclusion, on the evidence submitted by the plaintiff, that it was shown that at an early date efforts were made to improve rimless spectacles. He said:\nThe problem was to overcome their defects, namely, the high rate of breakage of the lenses and their tendency to loosening, and at the same time retain their advantageous features, namely, their lightness, wide range of vision and comparative inconspicuousness. The problem was primarily that of breakage and next that of loosening. It was also desired to reduce the inconspicuousness of rimless spectacles still further. There was certainly a clear recognition of the problem to be solved in the specifications of several of the patents such as, for example, the Stayman, Ferris and Nerney patents.\nHe adds:\nWithout discussing the patents in detail, I think that it may fairly be said that up to the time when the defendant's 2-point Numont mounting came on the market no satisfactory solution of the problem had been found.\nWhen the defendant's mounting came into production in 1938 there was an immediate and wide demand for it and it almost swept other types of rimless spectacles mountings off the market. This was admitted by Mr. Elliott for the plaintiff who said that when it first came it was about 90 per cent of the optician's business. Mr. Goodwin for the defendant also stated that it was the greatest revolution in the optical frame business.\nThe judgment appealed from finds that:\nThe evidence establishes that there was no practical contribution to the solution of the problem prior to the 2-point Numont mounting. The inventions covered by the patents (filed as Exhibits) were in the main paper proposals or, where that was not so, had no commercial success.\nThe judgment also states that:\nThe evidence establishes that the 2-point Numont mounting went a considerable distance towards solving the problem to which the inventor had addressed himself. There was really no substantial dispute of this fact;\nand that\nthe evidence is conclusive that the defendant's mounting made a substantial contribution to the solution of the problem of breakage.\nThe learned President then addresses himself to the question whether the change from the prior art made by Uhlemann was a patentable invention, and after having stated that \"there was no novelty in any of the parts, all of which were well known in the art prior to 1930,\" he adds:\nSo that whatever invention there may be in the defendant's mounting lies, not in any part or parts, but in the manner of attachment of some of them \u2026 The inventive idea lay in having a mounting in which there is a single point connection with the lens and the temple arms are connected at a specific place near the nasal edge of the lens, namely, to the lens edge engaging portion of the strap. It was the essence of the invention to have the temple arms so connected.\nPerhaps it may be said at once that counsel for the appellant suggested that the idea so described was not incorporated in the claims at the end of the specification, but the answer of the judgment to that objection was that:\nIt is to the securing of the temple arm at the lens edge engaging portion of the strap that all the claims are directed \u2026 The thread which runs through all the claims is the connection of the temple arm to the lens edge engaging portion of the strap at the nasal edge of the lens. In my opinion, counsel for the defendant has correctly set out the essence of the alleged invention. I do not think that any person skilled in the art who read the specification would have had any doubt about it or how to carry it into effect.\nIt may be said that, at bar, Mr. Robinson, counsel for the respondent, accepted this interpretation of the claims.\nWith this interpretation of the specification and of the claims it is clearly shown that Uhlemann's invention consists in a combination and it matters not, therefore, whether, as contended by counsel for the appellant, the elements thereof are old and were already known in the art as separate entities. As was pointed out by this Court in Baldwin International Radio Co. of Canada Ltd. v. Western Electric Co. Inc. et al 32, \"On this branch of the case, viz.: anticipation, the only point is whether the actual combination is new\" \u2026 \"It is idle to repeat that anticipation is not established by what may be qualified the 'imaginary assemblage' of separate elements gathered from glosses selected here and there in several and distinct anterior specifications.\" The invention lies in the particular combination, provided it is not a mere aggregation or a juxtaposition of known contrivances.\nWe have here a group of co-acting parts achieving a combined result or, as was said in British United Shoe Machinery Company Ltd. v. A. Fussell & Sons Ltd. 33, \"a collocation of intercommunicating parts so as to arrive at (what may be called) a simple and not a complex result.\" As was found in the Baldwin case supra, that satisfies the definition of a combination for the purposes of the patent law. After having examined the several prior patents claimed by the appellant to be anticipatory to the patent in issue, the judgment found that no anticipation had been established because none of these anterior patents, for purposes of practical utility, were equal to that given by the patent in suit; that nothing essential to the invention and necessary or material for its practical working and real utility could be found substantially in the prior publications, nor were there in them clear directions to use it in order to produce the particular result brought about by Uhlemann's discovery. In that connection, Lord Dunedin's reference to a \"mosaic\" in the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Pope Appliance Corporation v. Spanish River Pulp and Paper Mills, Ltd. 34 was referred to.\nWe agree that the judgment appealed from cannot be disturbed on that ground.\nThat leaves only the issue of subject matter; and the ground upon which it is suggested that the invention in the present case was not patentable is that the advantages \"would be obvious as a workshop improvement to a person skilled in the art and did not involve any inventive step.\"\nOn that point, the judgment is to the effect that the result accomplished by Uhlemann did involve the taking of an inventive step and that he was the first to take it. That was the finding of the learned trial judge, and with that conclusion we agree. Whether there is invention in a new thing is a question of fact \"for the judgment of whatever tribunal has the duty of deciding.\" (Lord Moulton's dictum, quoted by Terrell on Patents, 7th edition, page 71). The learned author adds:\u2014\nIt would seem to be necessary to fix upon some definition of invention, but this has never been done, and in my opinion no definition of invention can be found which is of the slightest assistance to anyone in a case of difficulty \u2026 When you approach the dividing line it is so impossible to get a test that it becomes, more or less, a matter of personal opinion. Some of the elements of a combination are altered so as to improve, but not essentially change its working. Is that a new invention? If it is only the substitution of mechanical elements which are notoriously the equivalents of the old elements the law is clear, but in any other case it is treated as being a question of fact for the judgment of whatever tribunal has the duty of deciding. As Tomlin J. (as he then was) said in Samuel Parkes & Co. v. Cocker Bros. 35:\nNobody, however, has told me, and I do not suppose anybody ever will tell me, what is the precise characteristic or quality the presence of which distinguishes invention from a workshop improvement. Day is day, and night, but who shall tell where day ends or night begins? \u2026 The truth is that, when once it had been found, as I find here, that the problem had waited solution for many years, and that the device is in fact novel and superior to what had gone before, and has been widely used, and used in preference to alternative devices, it is, I think, practically impossible to say that there is not present that scintilla of invention necessary to support the Patent.\nIn British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. Braulik 36, Fletcher Moulton L.J. remarked that \"ex post facto analysis of invention is unfair to the inventors, and in my opinion it is not countenanced by English Patent Law.\"\nThis was approved by the House of Lords in Non-Drip Measure Company, Limited v. Stranger's Limited et al 37, where Lord Russell of Killowen remarked:\nNothing is easier than to say, after the event, that the thing was obvious and involved no invention;\nand Lord Macmillan said (at p. 143):\nIt might be said ex post facto of many useful and meritorious inventions that they are obvious. So they are, after they have been invented.\nSee, also, the remarks of Fletcher Moulton L.J. in Hickton's Patent Syndicate v. Patents and Machine Improvements Company Ld. 38:\nTo say that the conception may be meritorious and may involve invention and may be new and original, and simply because when you have once got the idea it is easy to carry it out, that that deprives it of the title of being a new invention according to our patent law, is, I think, an extremely dangerous principle and justified neither by reason, nor authority.\nWe have it, therefore, in the present case that there was a problem to be solved and a want to be supplied. The 2-point Numont mounting made a substantial contribution to the solution of the problem. The commercial success of the invention, if not conclusive, is, at least in this case, an element to establish the clear recognition that the patent in suit met the problem and the want; that the advantages therein involved an inventive step, which Uhlemann was first to take, and that the appellant's action for a declaration of invalidity was rightly dismissed by the judgment a quo.\nThe appeal should therefore be dismissed, with costs.\nLocke J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment delivered in the Exchequer Court 39 dismissing a claim advanced in His Majesty's name for a declaration that Canadian Patent No. 381,380 issued to one Wm. R. Uhlemann on May 16, 1939, and assigned by the latter to the respondent, be cancelled and set aside. The information filed claimed the same relief in respect of Canadian Patent No. 392,499 and an industrial design registration, but as to these the defence filed was withdrawn and the issues thus restricted to the letters patent first above mentioned.\nOf the grounds for the relief claimed disclosed in the amended Particulars of Objection, those principally relied upon were: firstly, that there was no invention, having regard to the common knowledge in the art, and secondly, that the alleged inventions were not new and were known and used by others before the date when the said inventions were alleged to have been made. The patent in question was issued in Canada on the application of Uhlemann on May 16, 1939. In advance of this, however, he had applied on April 22, 1937, for a United States patent and, pursuant to such application, letters patent had been issued relating to the same matter under date of February 22, 1938. In the present proceedings the date of the filing of the application for the American patent is claimed as the date of the invention.\nThe invention claimed relates to rimless eye-glasses and by the specification it is stated that specifically it relates to a mounting means for the temple. The objects of the invention are stated to be:\u2014\n(a) to provide an improved temple mounting which prevents strain from being transmitted to the lenses;\n(b) to provide a temple mounting that requires a minimum amount of labour in attaching the mounting; (c) to provide an improved temple mounting which will be inconspicuous in appearance; and\n(d) to provide an improved temple mounting which will result in a saving of material.\nand this is followed by a further statement that other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and the claims.\nThe construction in question, to adopt the language of the specification, comprises:\na pair of channel-like straps having a lens-edge engaging portion with ears extending therefrom for embracing the edges and adjacent surface portions of the lenses, a bridge secured to these straps, a pair of temple-supporting wires having an anchorage portion thereof also secured to the straps, in general extending along, adjacent, and in the rear of the edges of the lenses, and a pair of temples pivotally connected with the ends of the wires, the axes of said hinge connections being substantially vertical, whereby the temples will fold compactly.\nThis description does not include any reference to nose guards, an essential part of any such construction, but later in the specification it is said that \"the usual nose guards are secured to the straps in any suitable manner.\"\nThe straps so called are in general small \"U\" shaped pieces of metal designed to receive the edge of the lens, the ears or sides engaging the surface of the lens and the inner bottom portion or shoe bearing against the edge. The lens is secured in this position either by means of a screw passing through both ears of the strap or by cement, or by so constructing the inner surface of the ears as to cause them to engage slots cut into the side or the edge of the lens for that purpose. Samples of rimless spectacles said to have been made in accordance with the specification of the patent were filed at the trial. It is not apparent from the exhibits filed as to the exact manner in which the mountings are put together. In the exhibit marked 31 (but which, it would appear from the evidence, was exhibit 30) the inner extremity of the so-called temple-supporting wires, the metal portion which carries the nose guards, the outer side of one ear of the strap and the bridge appear to be soldered together. In this exhibit the metal portion carrying the nose guards does not appear to be an integral part of the bridge, but in Exhibit H, produced by Uhlemann and also said to be made in accordance with the specification, the bridge and the metal portion supporting the nose guards appear to be one unit, to which the rear of the shoe of the strap and the temple-supporting wires are soldered. It is, in my opinion, unfortunate, in view of the nature of the issues, that the witness Uhlemann did not disclose the manner in which exhibits 30 and 31 were assembled, these apparently being the mountings which are commonly in use. The witness Elliott, an optician and optometrist of long experience, called on behalf of the plaintiff, said in reference to Exhibit 30 (incorrectly referred to as Exhibit 31 in the evidence) that it looked as if the temple arm was soldered to the base of the \"U\" from which the straps project and to the nose guard arm and the base of the bridge. In view of the great importance said to attach to the fact that the temple arm was attached to the \"lens engaging portion of the strap\", it would have been helpful if Uhlemann, who presumably knew, had dealt with the matter.\nFurther statements in the specification illustrated by reference to the drawings filed with it were to the effect that the temple-supporting wires were secured to the \"lens-edge engaging portion of the lens-supporting strap\" in the construction shown in two of the drawings, and again that it was secured, as shown in another of the figures \"in the plane of the lens-edge engaging portion thereof as by welding, soldering, or the like.\" Again referring to two of the illustrative figures it is said that the straps are secured in any suitable manner as by soldering or the like to the wire adjacent the junction of the bridge and the temple-supporting wire, and that:\nThe temple-supporting wires extend from the portions secured to the lens\u2013engaging portions rearwardly and angularly to follow the contour of the lens adjacent to and along the rear surface thereof.\nwhich may perhaps be intended to indicate a direct physical connection between the temple-supporting wire and a portion of the strap. These various descriptions of the nature of the mounting conclude with the following paragraph:\nIt will be seen that in all of the forms disclosed the temple-supporting wire follows the contour of the edge of the lens so as not to interfere with the vision and so as to be inconspicuous. It will also be noted that in all of the forms the temple-supporting wire is supported by the nose-engaging means. Before discussing the claims it should be noted that the practice of affixing the lenses in rimless spectacles by the use of straps of the nature referred to by Uhlemann in his specification was not new. In early types of such spectacles the inner edges of the lenses were secured by these straps which were soldered to the bridge or to the nose guards, while the spectacles were held in place by wires extending rearward which were attached by similar straps to the upper and outer edges of the lens and which engaged the ears of the wearer. The types of spectacles theretofore commonly in use employed frames in which the lenses were held and the elimination of such frames obviously produced problems in breakage, which was much less with the older type of framed spectacles. An examination of these early types of rimless glasses employing the above described method of holding them in place upon the nose makes it perfectly apparent that outward pressure upon the wires which engaged the ears would endanger the lens at the point where the straps were attached and cause breakage. Since of necessity a firm bridge and nose pieces of the nature referred to in Uhlemann's specification as the \"nose-engaging means\" were necessary component parts of any rimless spectacles, these obviously afforded the only point where the temple-supporting wires could be attached if direct strain upon the lenses, by reason of the movement of such wires and their temple-bows or extensions which engaged the ears of the wearer, was to be avoided. While to attach the temple-supporting wire directly to the inner side of the lens in the immediate proximity of the strap attached to the bridge, or the metal of the nose-engaging portion, might reduce the danger of breakage from pressure from the temple wires, some risk would undoubtedly remain.\nUhlemann made six claims for his invention, these being in the following terms:\n1. A spectacle construction comprising a pair of lenses, a pair of channel-like straps embracing the edges of said lenses, respectively, at the nasal edge of the lenses, each of said straps including a lens-edge engaging portion, a bridge member for connecting said straps, and a pair of temple\u2013 supporting wire members each having an anchorage portion extending therefrom and being secured directly to the lens-edge engaging portions of the strap and extending rearwardly and angularly therefrom and following the contour of the lens adjacent to and along the rear surface thereof for connection with the temple of the spectacle. 2. A spectacle construction comprising a pair of lenses, a pair of channel-like straps embracing the edges of said lenses, respectively, at the nasal edge of the lenses, each of said straps including a lens-edge engaging portion, a bridge member for connecting said straps, and a pair of temple\u2013 supporting wire members each having an anchorage portion extending therefrom and being secured directly to the lens-edge engaging portions of the strap intermediate the ends thereof and extending rearwardly and angularly therefrom and following the contour of the lens adjacent to and along the rear surface thereof for connection with the temple of the spectacle.\n3. A spectacle construction comprising a pair of lenses, a pair of channel-like straps embracing the edges of said lenses, respectively at the nasal edge of the lenses, each of said straps including a lens-edge engaging portion, a wire bridge member connecting said straps, and a pair of temple-supporting wire members each being formed integrally with said wire bridge member and being secured to the lens-edge engaging portions of the strap and extending rearwardly and angularly therefrom to follow the contour of the lens adjacent to and along the rear surface thereof for connection with the temple of the spectacle.\n4. A spectacle construction comprising a pair of lenses, a pair of channel\u2013like straps embracing the edges of said lenses, respectively, at the nasal edge of the lenses, each of said straps having a lens-edge engaging portion, a bridge member for connecting said straps, and a pair of temple-supporting wire members each having an anchorage portion extending therefrom parallel to the lens-edge engaging portion of said channel-like straps and being secured directly to said straps, there being offsets extending from said portions in the direction of the lenses, said temple\u2013supporting wire members extending from said offset portions and following the contour of the lens adjacent to and along the rear surface thereof for connection with the temple of the spectacle.\n5. A spectacle construction comprising a pair of lenses, a pair of channel-like straps embracing the edges of said lenses, respectively, at the nasal edge of the lenses, each of said straps including a lens-edge engaging portion, a bridge member for connecting said straps, and a pair of temple-supporting wire members each being secured to the lens-edge engaging portions of the strap and extending rearwardly and angularly therefrom and following the contour of the lens adjacent to and along the rear surface thereof for a substantial distance, the free end portions of said temple-supporting wire having a rearwardly extending portion terminating in a hinge for pivotally receiving the temple of the spectacle.\n6. A spectacle construction comprising a pair of lenses, a pair of channel-like straps embracing the edges of said lenses, respectively, at the nasal edges of the lenses, each of said straps including a lens\u2013edge engaging portion, a bridge member for connecting said straps, and a pair of temple\u2013supporting wire members each having an anchorage portion extending therefrom and being secured to said straps in the plane of the lens-edge engaging portions thereof, said temple-supporting wire member extending therefrom to follow the contour of the lens adjacent to and along the rear surface thereof for connection with the temples of the spectacles.\nIn each of the claims the shoe of the strap is referred to as \"the lens-edge engaging portion.\" The portion of the shoe which engaged the edge of the lens was of necessity the inner portion forming the base of the \"U\". Obviously the expression could not refer to this portion of it. Presumably what was intended to be indicated was the exterior of the shoe and in claims 1, 2 and 3 the construction described involves an anchorage portion extending from the temple-supporting wire being secured directly to the lens-edge engaging portion of the strap. Claim 4 describes the temple-supporting wire members as each having an anchorage portion \"extending therefrom parallel to the lens\u2013edge engaging portion of said channel\u2013like strap and being secured directly to said straps,\" but does not specify whether the attachment shall be to the shoe or to the ear of the strap. In Claim 5 there is no reference to an anchorage portion of the temple\u2013supporting wire, the connection being described as directly between the temple\u2013supporting wires and the shoe of the strap. In Claim 6 the temple\u2013supporting wire members are described as each having an anchorage portion \"secured to said straps in the plane of the lens\u2013edge engaging portions thereof\", which apparently contemplates that the attachment may be to one or other of the ears of the strap.\nReading the claims together with the specification that:\nin all of the forms the temple-supporting wire is supported by the nose\u2013 engaging means.\nthe inventor sought by attaching the temple\u2013supporting wire at some point on the strap, which strap in turn was connected by solder or otherwise to the metal of the nose\u2013 engaging means, to transfer the pressure to this portion of the structure and avoid any pressure on the lens itself.\nThe idea of a construction in which the pressure from the temple\u2013supporting wires was exerted upon the bridge rather than upon any part of the lens was far from new. On July 14, 1908, Joseph Savoie applied for a United States patent, for improvements in the class of spectacles having frameless or rimless lenses described in the third of his claims as being:\nthe combination with a pair of frameless lenses and a central nose-piece having said lenses mounted therein, of a pair of suitably bent resilient holding wires rigidly secured to the rear portion of the nose-piece and extending outwardly therefrom in a plane substantially parallel with that of the lenses, and means connected with the free ends of said holding wires adapted when in use to engage the head of the wearer. A patent was issued for the invention on March 16, 1909.\nOn February 23, 1909, Savoie applied for a Canadian patent for a structure of almost identical form, except that the wires which connected with the temple-supporting wires and extended rearward to engage the ears of the wearer were of more rigid construction than those described in the American application. Spectacles said to have been constructed in accordance with the specification of Savoie's American patent were filed as exhibit A at the trial and show the temple-supporting wires as being rigidly affixed to the bridge in a manner rendering it impossible that any pressure from the temple wires could be transmitted to the lenses. The latter were secured in straps similar to those employed by Uhlemann and which were either an integral part of the bridge or soldered to portions of the bridge projected forward to the point where the temple-supporting wires were connected.\nBy an application for a United States patent filed February 19, 1910, Savoie applied for a patent for an improvement in frameless spectacles, the object of which was to produce an improved temple holder constructed so as to be:\neasily, quickly and firmly attached or fixed to the usual or ordinary nose-piece, and also capable of being as readily disconnected from it.\nIn the explanatory part of the specification the following appears:\nBy means of my improvement herewith frameless spectacles as usually constructed, that is, spectacles having the temple-bows jointed to the lenses, may be quickly and cheaply converted into spectacles having, when in use, the general appearance of frameless eye-glasses. That is to say, the temple-bow members will then be jointed to bent wire holders having enlarged head portions superimposed upon and conforming to the back faces of the rear straps or ears of the well-known nose-pieces as devised for frameless spectacles, all the members being secured together by means of the usual fastening screw.\nUhlemann's \"temple-supporting wire member\" was described by Savoie as a \"temple-bow holder\" and the first of his claims which were allowed describes the invention thus:\nThe improved one-piece temple-bow holder member herein described, comprising a curved shank or body part having one end constructed for a co-operative engagement with a temple-bow and having the other or head end portion of the member elongated and extending inward toward the other end of the holder, its wall being quite thin and resilient and concave-convex in form cross-sectionally and adapted when in use to bear against and cover the outer or convex face of an elongated aperture ear or strap of a nose-piece, the said head part having a hole therethrough registering with that of the ear for receiving the usual holding screw. The drawings attached to the application show the temple-bow holder member fitted over the exterior of the ear of a strap similar to that used by Uhlemann and secured by the screw which secured the lenses in the strap. There was no contact in this construction between the temple-bow holder member and the lens. The strap appears to have been either part of the bridge or attached to it, as in the case of Uhlemann, by solder. It will be observed that this connection, like that described in Claim 6 of Uhlemann's patent, was \"in the plane of the lens edge engaging portion\" of the strap. The method of attachment to be employed in the structure described in Claim 6 of Uhlemann is not, however, specified.\nOn October 11, 1909, Frederick A. Stevens applied for a United States patent for improvements in frameless spectacles, a patent issuing pursuant to the application of March 29, 1910. Stevens' structure employed a wire member similar to Savoie's temple bow-holder which followed generally the lines of the lower edges of the lens rather than the upper, as in the case of Savoie's design. The nose-piece was provided at each end with straps into which the lenses were fitted and the connection between the wire members, according to the specification, was as follows:\nIn the present invention the bent connection or member (the temple-bow holder) is constructed and adapted to be readily positioned with respect to the lens and nose-piece while at the same time being secured to the lens and practically interlocking with the nose-piece, thereby, in co-operation with the lens-screw, serving to maintain the several parts in position.\nand further:\nThe inner end portions of said member are enlarged so as to provide a substantially flat thin head, adapted in use to register with the integral ear or ears of the nose-piece and also to lay flatwise snugly against the rear side of the lens. In Figs. 1 to 4 the said head portion is represented as having an open transverse notch or recess formed between the upper and lower lugs shaped to receive therein the adjacent shank part of the nose-piece.\nIn Stevens' construction, while apparently the head of the temple-supporting wire or temple-bow holder was in direct contact with the side of the lens at the point of attachment, it also was designed to engage the shank part of the nose-piece. As in the case of Savoie's design, a screw was employed which passed through the ears of the strap and the head of the supporting wire and the lens, to secure the latter in its place. Evidence as to other patents obtained after those of Savoie and Stevens and in advance of that obtained by Uhlemann was given on behalf of the Crown but, in my opinion, it is unnecessary to deal with these in detail to dispose of the issues in the present action. Of these, the United States patent obtained by Ferris on September 4, 1934, one of the objects of which was stated to be the provision of a mounting adapted for use in spectacles for eliminating strain upon the lenses, in which the temple-bows or wires which engaged the ears of the wearer were attached at either extremity of the bridge or an extension thereof and the lenses were secured from above in straps attached to the bridge, and that granted to Bishop in the United States on March 26, 1936, may be mentioned. Bishop's construction differed from that of Ferris in that, while the temple-bows were affixed in like manner to the extremities of the bridge or an extension of it and the lenses were similarly affixed in straps soldered to the bridge, the nose guards were affixed to the lenses by straps rather than to the bridge, as contemplated by Ferris.\nConsidering first the contention of the plaintiff that there was no invention, having regard to the common knowledge in the art. The Patent Act 1935, s. 2(d), defines invention as meaning:\nany new and useful art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new or useful improvement in any art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter.\nS. 26 provides that, subject to certain defined terms, a patent may issue to an inventor of an invention which was, inter alia, not known or used by any other person before he invented it. S. 35 requires the applicant, by his specification, to correctly and fully describe the invention and its operation or use as contemplated by the inventor and set forth clearly the method of constructing the machine or manufacture in \"such full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which it appertains, or with which it is most closely connected, to make, construct, compound or use it.\" In Natural Colour Kinematograph v. Bioschemes Ld. 40, Earl Loreburn, dealing with the duty of a patentee to state clearly and distinctly either in direct words or by clear and distinct reference the nature and limits of what he claims, said that if he uses language which when fairly read is avoidably obscure or ambiguous the patent is invalid, whether the defect be due to design, or to carelessness or to want of skill. In the present matter, the expression \"lens-edge engaging portion of the strap\" used both in the specification and the claims is, in my opinion, ambiguous in the sense of being capable of more than one meaning, as has been pointed out above. While the objection of ambiguity is made against both the specification and the claims, it appears to me unnecessary to consider the point since, even if it be given the meaning apparently adopted by the defendant as describing the rear of the shoe, the patent cannot, in my opinion, be sustained.\nThe learned President of the Exchequer Court 41 in his judgment at the trial has found that the inventive idea lay in having a mounting in which there was a single point connection with the lens and the temple arms were connected at a specific place near the nasal edge of the lens, namely, to the lens-edge engaging portion of the strap, it being of the essence of the invention that the temple arm should be so connected. In view of the statement in the specification that in all of the forms exhibited by the illustrations and referred to in the specification the temple-supporting member is to be supported by the nose-engaging means, and of the fact that the outer portion of the case of the strap is soldered to the nose-engaging means, it is necessary to examine with some care the evidence of the manner in which this so-called invention has been used in practice, since the manner of its use should lead to a sound conclusion as to what was the essence of the invention.\nFour exhibits were filed at the trial and numbered 30, 31, 32 and 36 and it is common ground that these illustrated the manner in which Uhlemann's invention was put to use. In the exhibit marked 30 the lens-edge engaging portion of the strap, which I will continue to refer to hereafter as the shoe, consists of a narrow piece of metal approximately three-eighths of an inch in length, the inner portion of which engages, and is the only part that engages, the edge of the lens. The only evidence given at the trial as to the manner in which the mounting was assembled is that of Elliott, which is above referred to, but an examination of the exhibit shows that there is no connection between the temple-supporting arm and the shoe. In the case of the exhibits marked 31, 32 and 36, the shoe consists of three small thin pieces of metal of differing lengths, the longer of which is approximately three-eighths of an inch in length and the shorter of which bears against and is attached to or constitutes the bottom of the \"U\" shaped strap. In none of these exhibits is the temple-supporting arm attached to the shoe. In the absence of any evidence on the point, and Uhlemann apparently decided to give none, it is necessary to rely on what is disclosed by an examination of the three exhibits, and in each of them the temple-supporting arm appears to be soldered to the side of one of the straps and at the same point to the metal of the nose-engaging means.\nUhlemann gave evidence at length at the trial and a fifth exhibit marked \"H\" was introduced during his examination-in-chief and his evidence directed mainly to it. In this exhibit the strap differed materially from those used in the mountings theretofore produced, being apparently of solid construction, the ears being in breadth practically double their length and the shoe being of the same breadth as the ears. According to Uhlemann, this type of strap was made in accordance with a patent developed by his father some fifteen years ago and was so constructed that diagonally angled slots within the lens engaged lugs inside the strap, creating a dove-tail construction and this eliminated the necessity of drilling a hole in the glass. In this exhibit the temple-supporting arm is soldered both to the side of one ear and the rear of the shoe of the strap as well as to the metal of the nose-engaging means, which is an integral part of the bridge. According to Uhlemann, straps of this nature have not been sold \"except through our own distribution,\" and in cross-examination he said that they did not go into general use. The spring type of straps, as used in Exhibits 31, 32 and 36, he said, were acknowledged to be a better construction and tended to reduce breakage.\nIt is, in my opinion, the only proper inference to be drawn from the evidence that the method of attachment of the temple-supporting arm to the so-called nose-engaging means shown in Exhibits 30, 31, 32 and 36 show the manner in which the mounting described in the patent has been put to use. With great respect for the contrary opinion of the learned President of the Exchequer Court, this demonstrates, in my opinion, that the inventive idea, if there was one, lay not in attaching the temple-supporting arm to the shoe of the strap but rather to the nose-engaging means at the point where the strap was soldered to it, for the very purpose described in the specification of transferring any pressure from the temples to the nose-engaging means and the bridge.\nIn order to determine whether \"Uhlemann's construction was new, it is necessary to determine what was the state of the public knowledge on April 22, 1937. Savoie had in July 1908 obtained his patent for a form of mounting in which the temple-supporting wires were attached to a projection from the bridge, and in 1909 had obtained a Canadian patent. In 1910 he had obtained his United States patent for the construction above described, in which the temple-supporting wire was secured to the exterior of the strap. In both of these mountings the pressure from the temples was conveyed to the bridge and diverted from the lens. These patents were, in my opinion, for combinations and, as said by Lord Moulton in Pugh v. Riley Cycle Co. 42, the publication of a proper and sufficient specification of an invention of a combination is a publication of each subordinate integer of that combination. From the moment of its publication, each subordinate integer therefore passes into the domain of public knowledge as fully and as certainly as does the whole combination of which they are parts. Uhlemann by his specification said that his construction provided a pair of temple-supporting wires having an anchorage portion thereof secured to the straps, and that in the construction shown in his Figures 1 to 3 the supporting-wire was secured to the lens-edge engaging portion of the lens supporting strap, while in Figure 6 it was secured to the rear edge of the strap in the plane of the lens-edge engaging portion. It is only in Claims 1, 2, 3 and 5 that the temple-supporting arm is stated to be attached to the shoe of the strap. Claim 4 refers to the anchorage portion of the temple-supporting wire as being secured directly to the straps, while Claim 6 adopts the language of the specification in saying that the anchorage portion is \"secured to said straps in the plane of the lens-edge engaging portion thereof.\" The manner of attachment employed in actual use, as shown by the exhibits, is that described in Claim 4 and appears to me to fall within the language of the specification. How soldering the temple-supporting wire to the shoe, which was in turn soldered to the metal of the nose-engaging means, could be more effective in diverting pressure from the lens than soldering it to the side of the ear of the strap and to the nose-engaging means is not explained. The manner in which the mounting was put to use and continues to be used shows conclusively, in my opinion, what was the essence of the so-called invention. The learned trial judge has found that there was no novelty in any of the parts, all of which were well-known prior to 1930, and that the desirability of having a single point connection with the lens and the temple arms connected somewhere near the nasal edge of the lens was not new. It may also be said that the idea of attaching the temple-supporting wires in a manner which would transmit the pressure from the temple-bows to the bridge was not new, having been disclosed in both of Savoie's patents.\nThe change made by Uhlemann from Savoie's construction disclosed in the 1910 patent was to secure his temple-bow holder to the strap by solder rather than to the ear of the strap by a screw. According to the witness Uhlemann, while he had not constructed a mounting according to Savoie's 1910 patent, in use there would have been difficulty caused by the strain on the temple-bow holder loosening the screw. Was it invention to guard against any such movement by attaching the temple-bow holder to the side of the strap in this manner to prevent this? In Pope Appliance Corporation v. Spanish River Pulp and Paper Mills 43, Viscount Dunedin said that what constituted invention was finding out something which has not been found out by other people. It was Savoie's idea that the strain from the temples should be transmitted to the bridge by attaching his temple-bow holder either in the manner disclosed by his 1908 or 1910 patent. The strap to one ear to which Savoie secured his temple-bow holder in his 1910 patent was either a part of, or soldered to, the bridge, as was that of Uhlemann. Both constructions transferred the pressure from the temples to the bridge. Did the slight change made involve the exercise of the inventive faculties, or can it be said that it showed a degree of ingenuity which must have been the result of thought and experiment (Crosley Radio Corporation v. Canadian General Electric Company 44, Rinfret J. at 556). In my opinion, Uhlemann's construction was merely an application of the ideas disclosed by Savoie \"which anybody familiar with and skilled in the art might be expected to arrive at without the exercise of invention in the sense of the patent law\", to adopt the language of Sir Lyman Duff C.J. in Vanity Fair Silk Mills v. Commissioner of Patents 45.\nMuch was made at the trial of the Success in the market of mountings made in accordance with Uhlemann's patent. That, of course, is a matter to be taken into consideration but, as pointed out by Lord Herschell in Longbottom v. Shaw 46, it is obvious that it cannot be regarded as in any sense conclusive on the question we are here considering. That mountings made in accordance with Uhlemann's patent were very extensively sold is undoubted but this is not to say that the advance made on previous knowledge has been sufficient to constitute invention.

M. le Juge Gibsone, devant qui la cause s'est instruite \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, a rejet\u00e9 l'action. La Cour d'Appel 2 l'a accueillie, et a accord\u00e9 au demandeur un montant de $2,424.01.\nLa cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9e devant cette Cour, et de part et d'autre les parties ont assum\u00e9 que nous avions jurisdiction pour l'entendre, vu que le montant en litige \u00e9tait apparem- ment sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 $2,000.00. Au cours de l'argument cependant, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu'il y avait eu erreur dans la computation des chiffres en Cour d'Appel, et l'appelant aussi bien que l'intim\u00e9 s'entendent sur ce point.\nL'erreur provient du fait que la Cour d'Appel, se basant sur les chiffres du demandeur, non contest\u00e9s par le d\u00e9fen-deur, a tenu compte des items suivants:\u2014\nPerte de salaire du demandeur \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. $ 378.00\nPerte de salaire de la femme du demandeur \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 175.00\nIncapacit\u00e9 du demandeur \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 200.00\nIncapacit\u00e9 de son \u00e9pouse \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 500.00\nTotal \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 $ 1,153.00\nComptes de m\u00e9decins, h\u00f4pitaux, automobiles,\ngarages, etc., produits en liasse \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 $ 1,271.01\nGrand total \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. $ 2,424.01\nOr, il arrive que l'addition de ces divers items n'est pas exacte, car les comptes de m\u00e9decins, h\u00f4pitaux, automobiles, garages, ne forment pas un total de $1,271.01 mais seulement de $657.01. Il r\u00e9sulte que le montant v\u00e9ritable des dommages subis, n'est pas de $2,424.01 mais bien de $1,810.01. M\u00eame, si l'on ajoute l'int\u00e9r\u00e9t \u00e0 cette somme, tel qu'autoris\u00e9 par l'article 43 de l'Acte de la Cour Supr\u00eame, elle serait encore insuffisante pour conf\u00e9rer juridiction \u00e0 cette Cour, car elle se trouve inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 $2,000.00.\nL'article 36 de la Loi de la Cour Supr\u00e9me du Canada se lit ainsi:\u2014\nSous r\u00e9serve des articles quarante et quarante-quatre, il peut \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada d'un jugement d\u00e9finitif ou d'un jugement accordant une motion de non-lieu (nonsuit) ou ordonnant un nouveau proc\u00e8s, de la plus haute cour de dernier ressort dans une province, ou de l'un de ses juges, pranono\u00e9\na) Dans une proc\u00e9dure judiciaire o\u00f9 le montant ou la valeur de la mati\u00e8re en litige dans l'appel d\u00e9passe deur mille dollars.\nIl est plus que douteux que la juridiction de cette Cour soit subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 une erreur de calcul, reconnue par tous, surtout quand l'intention du tribunal dont le jugement est frapp\u00e9 d'appel, est aussi manifeste que dans le cas qui nous occupe. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, un jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectivement rendu par la Cour d'Appel pour la somme de $2,424.01, en vertu duquel le demandeur peut apparemment ex\u00e9cuter pour ce montant. Il ne me semble pas n\u00e9cessaire cependant, de d\u00e9terminer si oui ou non, cette Cour a juridiction, car un autre rem\u00e8de appartient aux parties. C'est \u00e0 elles qu'il incombe avant de venir devant cette Cour, de faire d\u00e9terminer le jugement final. Ce pouvoir appartient a la Cour d'Appel, dont la juridiction \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard n'est pas \u00e9puis\u00e9e, m\u00eame si le jugement est enregistr\u00e9.\nComme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans une cause de Major v. La Ville de Beauport 3, la Cour Supr\u00eame n'accorde la permission d'appeler, que lorsque tous les moyens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9puis\u00e9s dans la province pour obtenir une d\u00e9termination finale. Il doit en \u00eatre ainsi dans le cas qui nous est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9. Il ne s'agit pas \u00e9videmment d'une demande de permission d'appeler, mais on peut dire par analogie, je crois, que lorsqu'il s'agit d'une erreur de calcul, qui affecte notre juridiction, tous les recours que la loi donne aux parties pour la rectifier, doivent \u00eatre exerc\u00e9s devant la plus haute cour provinciale, o\u00f9 jugement peut \u00eatre rendu, avant que nous ne soyons saisis de plano du litige, \u00e0 moins que le droit d'appel n'existe ind\u00e9pendamment de cette erreur. Autrement, il ne s'agirait pas d'un jugement dont la \"finalit\u00e9\" est l'une des conditions essentielles \u00e0 notre droit statutaire et par cons\u00e9queunt restreint, d'en prendre connaissance.\nLe Code de proc\u00e9dure civile pourvoit \u00e0 la correction des erreurs cl\u00e9ricales. L'article 546 nous dit:\u2014\n546. Le juge peut, en tout temps, \u00e0 la demande d'une des parties, corriger les erreurs cl\u00e9ricales entachant un jugement.\nEt l'article 1248, plac\u00e9 dans le chapitre relatif \u00e0 la Cour d'Appel, se lit ainsi:\u2014\n1248. La Cour d'Appel peut exercer tous les pouvoirs n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 sa juridition, et rendre les ordonnances qu'elle juge convenables pour suppl\u00e9er aux d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9s du dossier, pour arr\u00eater toute proc\u00e9dure en cour inf\u00e9rieure dans une cause port\u00e9e en appel, pour r\u00e9gler les cas o\u00f9 un cautionnement doit \u00eatre donn\u00e9 ou renouvel\u00e9, et pour pr\u00e9voir a tous les cas o\u00f9 la loi ne fournit pas un rem\u00e9de sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 la partie.\nAinsi qu'on peut le voir, la Cour d'Appel est rev\u00eatue de pouvoirs tr\u00e8s vastes pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la situation. Si en vertu de 1'article 546 C.P., un seul juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure peut corriger une erreur cl\u00e9ricale entachant l'un de ses jugements, il me semble \u00e9vident que la Cour d'Appel est investie des m\u00eames pouvoirs. \u00c9videmment, la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada pourrait corriger une erreur cl\u00e9ricale dans une cause dont elle serait l\u00e9galement saisie, mais avant de l'\u00eatre, elle n'a pas plus de juridiction pour le faire, que pour d\u00e9terminer finalement l'issue du litige.\nLa conclusion qui logiquement s'impose, est que le dossier doit \u00eatre retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour d'Appel du District de Qu\u00e9bec, afin que le montant soit \u00e9tabli par ce tribunal. C'est apr\u00e9s cela seulement qu'il sera possible de constater s'il s'agit d'un jugement dont le montant en litige d\u00e9passe $2,000.00, l'une des conditions essentielles \u00e0 notre juridiction. Dans l'intervalle, la cause sera mise hors du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, avec permission aux parties de revenir devant cette Cour pour d\u00e9termination finale de leurs droits sur le pr\u00e9sent appel et adjudication sur les frais de cette ordonnance.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gagnon & de Billy.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Arthur B\u00e9langer.\n1 Q.R.

By order of the Court it was re-argued before the full bench on Oct. 2.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCriminal Law\u2014Theft\u2014Receiving\u2014Retaining\u2014Recent Possession\u2014Whether where explanation rejected but accused acquitted of receiving conviction on retaining charge maintainable\u2014Whether doctrine of recent possession applies to retaining\u2014Cr. Code s. 399.\nThe accused was charged with (a) receiving and (b) retaining stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. The evidence established that the goods were found in the recent possession of the accused. He gave no evidence but his wife, called as a witness on his behalf, gave an explanation as to how the goods came into her husband\u2019s possession. The trial judge, sitting without a jury, found that the explanation was not a reasonable one but acquitted the accused on the receiving charge and convicted him on the charge of retaining. An appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was dismissed but leave to appeal to this Court was granted on the following questions of law: (a) The doctrine of recent possession does not apply to a charge of retaining stolen goods; (b) The learned trial judge having acquitted the accused on a charge of receiving could not in the circumstances of the case convict him on a charge of retaining; (c) An accused person cannot be convicted of both of the offences of receiving and retaining.\nHeld: Rinfret C.J., Rand, Kellock, Estey, Locke and Cartwright JJ., (Kerwin, Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. dissenting):\n1. The appeal should be allowed.\n2. An accused person cannot be convicted both of receiving and of retaining. R. v. Yeaman 42 Can. C.C. 78; R. v. Searle 51 Can. C.C. 128; Frozocas v. The King 60 Can. C.C. 324; Ecrement v. The King 84 Can. C.C. 349.\n3. The accused having been acquitted on a charge of receiving, could not in the circumstances of the case be convicted of retaining.\nPer Rand, Kellock, Locke and Cartwright JJ. The accused having been acquitted on the receiving charge it was for the Crown to establish subsequent guilty knowledge which it failed to do. There was accordingly no evidence or no sufficient evidence upon which a charge of retaining could be supported.\nPer Kerwin J. contra. The rejection of the explanation permits the doctrine of recent possession to apply to the charge of retaining. Not only was there evidence to determine that the explanation was not reasonable but it appeared that was the only proper conclusion.\nPer Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. contra. In acquitting the accused on the charge of receiving the trial judge said he did not accept the explanation and therefore the presumption was not rebutted and it was open to him to decide as he did.\nHeld: also, Rinfret C.J. Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey and Fauteux JJ., (Rand, Kellock, Locke and Cartwright JJ. dissenting). The doctrine of recent possession applies to a charge of retaining. The King v. Lum Man Bo 16 Can. C.C. 274; Lopatinsky v. The King [1948] S.C.R. 220.\nPer Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. S. 399 provides for two distinct offences \u201creceiving\u201d or \u201cretaining\u201d knowing it to have been so obtained. It matters not then since when on a charge of retaining, or how long after on a charge of receiving, the guilty knowledge co-exists with possession, provided it does at any time during retention on the former, and at the time of reception on the latter. To import into the section any question as to the duration of the guilty knowledge is to add to the word \u201cknowing\u201d, the most essential word in the entire section, a qualification expressly rejected from the provision by the very word itself.\nPer Estey J. The language adopted by Parliament indicates it contemplated the application of the doctrine to the offence of retaining, and this view finds support in that Parliament has not since Lum Man Bo supra was decided in 1910, enacted any amendment to the section.\nPer Rand, Kellock, Locke and Cartwright JJ. contra. The doctrine does not apply, the Crown must establish not only possession but knowledge subsequently acquired of the stolen character of the goods. R. v. Cohen 8 Cox C.C. 41 and R. v. Sleep 1 Le. & Ca. 44, applied. The King v. Lum Man Bow supra, Richler v. The King [1939] S.C.R. 101 and Lopatinsky v. The King, supra, distinguished. APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming his conviction by Forsyth County Court Judge in the County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court for the County of York on a charge of retaining stolen goods in his possession. Reversed.\nC.L. Dubin K.C. for the appellant. The doctrine of recent possession does not apply to a charge of retaining. The theory upon which the doctrine evolved was that a person who was in possession of goods recently stolen was likely to be the thief and he was called upon for an explanation as to the manner in which they came into his possession. It had been the law that the so-called presumptive inference from which a jury might convict related only to theft and not receiving. R. v. Langmeand[2] apparently for the first time extended that charge to receiving because receiving also contemplates a guilty knowledge at the time of receipt. Receiving recently stolen goods brings into question only the initial possession of the goods whereas on a charge of retaining the initial possession is presumed to be innocent and a person is guilty of retaining as distinguished from receiving when having come by the goods honestly he later acquires knowledge that they are stolen and keeps them. On such a charge an accused is not called on to explain his initial possession because it is presumed innocent and the entire doctrine of recent possession only calls upon the accused to explain his initial possession. R. v. Searle[3]; R. v. Jones[4]; R. v. Carmichael[5]; R. v. Powell[6]; R. v. Lamoureux[7]; R. v. Scott[8]; R. v. Watson[9].\nThe judgment in R. v. Lum Man Bow[10] to the contrary was wrongfully decided and it will be noted that the argument now submitted was not made in that case, The contrary view in Richler v. The King[11] is obiter and the Court was not dealing with the argument now submitted.\nIn the alternative, assuming that the doctrine of recent possession applies to a charge of retaining, the learned trial judge having acquitted the accused of receiving could not properly in the circumstances have convicted him of retaining and the verdict is inconsistent. Assuming the doctrine did apply all that is thereby required was an explanation that might be reasonably true that the accused came by the goods honestly. Roach J.A. in the Court of Appeal held that the doctrine only required an explanation of how the accused came by the goods and that an explanation which rebuts the presumption on the receiving charge also rebuts it on the retaining charge and in the absence of other evidence establishing guilty knowledge at the time of receiving he is entitled to an acquittal. By an acquittal on the charge of receiving the accused has rebutted the presumption of guilty knowledge at the time he initially came into possession of the goods and any adverse inference from recent possession of stolen goods has been met. The Court of Appeal failed to give any effect whatever to the acquittal on the charge of receiving. Having been acquitted of receiving the accused is in the same position as if his explanation had been accepted and he could not properly be convicted unless there was evidence that after his initial possession of the goods he subsequently learned they were stolen. There is no such evidence. Neither the trial judge nor the Court of Appeal made any such finding and the conviction was made and affirmed solely on the doctrine of recent possession. The conviction on the charge of retaining was inconsistent with the acquittal on the receiving charge. R. v. Cook[12]; R. v. Mondt[13]; R. v. Hayes and Pallante[14]; R. v. Christ[15].\nThe accused cannot be convicted of both the offences of receiving and retaining. The Court of Appeal held that the accused should have been convicted of receiving but having been acquitted on the receiving charge all the evidence could be considered on a retaining charge as if there had been no acquittal on the charge of receiving, and that the accused could be convicted of both offences, but the offences are alternative offences and an accused cannot be guilty of both. Where the accused has knowledge of the goods being stolen at the time of their reception, he is guilty of receiving and that offence is complete. If he continues to hold them he is still only guilty of receiving. It is only where he realizes some time after he initially received them that the goods are stolen and then retains them that he is guilty of retaining. R. v. Brown[16]; R. v. Yeamen[17]; R. v. McClennan[18]; Ecrement v. The King[19]; R. v. Ungaro[20].\nC.P. Hope K.C. for the respondent. \u201cReceiving\u201d and \u201cretaining\u201d in s. 399 relate to two different offences. R. v. Searle[21]. This statement of the law applies here as the appellant was acquitted of \u201creceiving\u201d and convicted of \u201cretaining\u201d. The appellant contends the doctrine of recent possession does not apply to a charge of retaining. It has long been held that it applies to the offence of receiving. R. v. Langmead[22]. The Court of Appeal of British Columbia held that it applied to the offence of retaining. R. v. Lum Man Bow[23] and R. v. Davis[24]. The latter case proceeded on the basis that the Crown must prove that the goods were in fact stolen. In R. v. Parker[25] McDonald J.A. at p. 12 says that in cases of receiving and retaining the question is not whether the explanation is believed but whether it is a reasonable one. O\u2019Halloran J.A. in R. v. Mandzuk[26] at 290 \u201cLack of proof that the appellant knew the nature of the property and that it was stolen, fail to take into consideration that when a person is found in possession of recently stolen goods (in this case slightly under two months) that fact may be regarded as circumstantial evidence of his knowledge (and cf. R. v. Wilson[27] Martin J.A. at 67) that they were stolen, unless he gives a reasonable explanation of his possession of them.\u201d Bird J.A. at 295 \u201cThere being evidence of recent possession of stolen goods, a prima facie presumption arises that the accused is either the thief or the retainer of the stolen property.\u201d In R. v. Tuck[28] the accused convicted of retaining appealed, one ground being misdirection as to recent possession. Roach J.A. who wrote the judgment of the Court says at p. 52 \u201cThe proper direction on the trial of an accused charged with receiving or retaining has been settled, if there was previously any doubt about it by the Supreme Court of Canada in Richler v. The King[29].\u201d At 103 the learned Chief Justice, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said: \u201cThe question, therefore, to which it was the duty of the learned trial judge to apply his mind was not whether the explanation might be reasonably true, or to put it in other words, whether the Crown had discharged the onus of satisfying the learned trial judge beyond a reasonable doubt that the explanation of the accused could not be accepted as a reasonable one and that he was guilty\u201d, and at p. 54 \u201cIt is true that the learned trial judge in those parts of his charge which I have quoted refers to the doctrine of recent possession in cases where the charge is receiving. But since the doctrine of recent possession applies similarly to a charge of retaining there was no misdirection\u2026\u201d In R. v. Lopatinsky[30] Estey J., who wrote the judgment of the Court, applies the doctrine to the offence of retaining.\nAs to the appellant\u2019s second point that the trial judge having acquitted on the receiving charge could not convict on the retaining charge. He was entitled to convict on both or either of them according to the way in which he viewed the evidence. R. v. Langmead supra per Pollock C.B. at 467, Martin B. at 468. In the instant case it was just as logical to convict of the retaining on an acquittal of receiving as it was in the Langmead case to acquit of theft and convict of receiving. It is for the jury to decide what is the proper verdict having regard to the facts. R. v. Lincoln[31]. The reasoning of Roach J.A. who wrote the judgment of the Court of Appeal[32] is the correct reasoning, that of Martin J.A. in R. v. Brown[33] appears to be based on fallacious reasoning.\nAs to the appellant\u2019s third point that an accused person can not be convicted of both the offences of receiving and retaining, the point is irrelevant as the appellant was convicted only of retaining.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE: Leave to appeal was granted on the following questions of law:\n(a) The doctrine of recent possession does not apply to a charge of retaining stolen goods; (b) The learned trial judge having acquitted the accused on a charge of receiving could not in the circumstances of the case convict him on a charge of retaining;\n(c) An accused person cannot be convicted of both offences of receiving and retaining.\nIn my humble view, the answer to Question (b) is sufficient to dispose of the appeal.\nThere is no doubt that the weapons were stolen goods; that the accused received them and that he had acquired recent possession of them. The only other element necessary to be proved in order to justify conviction on the charge of receiving was that the accused, at the time he received them, knew they were so stolen.\nTo establish that necessary element \u201cthe Crown relied on the doctrine of recent possession by the application of which the burden rested on the accused to give an explanation that he came by these weapons innocently\u201d, which explanation might reasonably be true, and, because it might reasonable be true, would raise a doubt as to his guilt.\nSuch explanation was given by the wife of the accused. The trial judge analyzed that explanation, examined every fact or element of same and came to the conclusion that it was not reasonable; but, when he came to apply that conclusion to the charge of receiving, he nevertheless acquitted the accused of that charge. On the same explanation, which he did not believe, he found the accused guilty of retaining.\nAs the only ground upon which he could acquit the accused of receiving was the explanation given by the wife, one must come to the conclusion that he believed it and found it reasonable with regard to the charge of receiving; while he stated in his judgment that he did not believe it with regard to the charge of retaining.\nIn my opinion that is incompatible. He could not at the same time believe the explanation or find it reasonable and disbelieve it and find it unreasonable.\nAll the facts considered by him with regard to that explanation, which led him to state that he thought the latter unreasonable, were all facts having to do with the charge of receiving. None were fresh facts which happened subsequent to the receiving and relating only to the charge of retaining. That is precisely the interpretation of Roach J.A., who delivered the reasons for the Court of Appeal:[34]. \u201cThe trial judge held that the explanation was not reasonable but he nevertheless acquitted him\u201d. There was only one explanation given and it applied to the charge of receiving. There was no distinct explanation given as regard to the charge of retaining.\nThere were no new facts put in evidence whereby a distinction could be made between the receiving and the retaining.\nVery respectfully I think that the trial judge having acquitted the accused on the charge of receiving could not, in the circumstances of the case, convict him on a charge of retaining.\nIn my view, there is an absolute contradiction between the two findings of the trial judge.\nFor that reason, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the conviction set aside.\nHowever, I understand that the reason for submitting de novo the appeal to the full Court was mainly to have the Court pronounce upon the question whether the doctrine of recent possession does or does not apply to a charge of retaining stolen goods; and on that additional point I wish to state that I concur with the other members of the Court who express the opinion that the doctrine does apply equally to a charge of retaining as to a charge of receiving stolen goods.\nKERWIN J. (dissenting)\u2014This is an appeal, by leave granted under section 1025 of the Criminal Code as enacted by s. 42 of c. 39 of the Statutes of 1948. The appellant was convicted in the County Court Judge\u2019s Criminal Court of the County of York, on June 7, 1950, of retaining in his possession, in the months of January and February, 1950, a Remington repeating shot gun and a Remington repeating rifle, the property of Grayson D. Burruss and therefore stolen, knowing the same to have been so stolen. This charge was the fourth count in a charge sheet which charged the appellant, first, with breaking and entering by day in January, 1950, the dwelling house of Grayson D. Burruss and stealing three guns and other articles, second, with breaking and entering by night in January, 1950, the same dwelling house with intent to commit theft, third, with receiving in his possession in the months of January and February the shot gun and rifle theretofore stolen, knowing the same to have been so stolen.\nIt was proved that on January 16, 1950, the gun and rifle were stolen from Mr. Burruss\u2019 house. The gun was found in the possession of the accused in his house on February 25, 1950. The rifle had on some earlier date in February been handed by the accused to one Enge for sale by the latter on terms that it would be sold for at least twenty dollars and that anything over that could be kept by Enge. There is no question about the identity of the gun and rifle and of the fact of their having been stolen. The accused did not give evidence but an explanation as to how these two articles came into his possession was given by his wife, which to some extent was corroborated by the testimony of Enge who had been called on behalf of the Crown. The County Court Judge found the explanation not reasonable and he found the appellant guilty on the fourth count, that is, of retaining, but endorsed the charge sheet with a verdict of not guilty on counts 1, 2 and 3.\nUnder these circumstances the first point argued was that the doctrine of recent possession does not apply to a charge of retaining. The applicable provision of the Criminal Code is s. 399, which reads as follows:\n399. Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to fourteen years\u2019 imprisonment, who receives or retains in his possession anything obtained by any offence punishable on indictment, or by any acts wheresoever committed, which, if committed in Canada would have constituted an offence punishable upon indictment, knowing such thing to have been so obtained.\nThe offence of retaining was unkown to the common or statute law of England but was introduced in Canada when the Criminal Code was first enacted in 1892. It is an entirely separate offence from receiving. The doctrine of recent possession, as to both theft and receiving, was clearly established in Reg. v. Langmead[35]. There, Langmead had been indicted and tried for stealing sheep, and on a second count, for receiving the sheep knowing them to have been stolen. The jury convicted him on the latter count. It was argued that upon an indictment for receiving stolen goods, there should be some evidence to show that the goods were in fact stolen by some other person, and that recent possession of the stolen property was not alone sufficient to support such an indictment as such possession was evidence of stealing and not of receiving. That argument was not accepted. Chief Baron Pollock pointed out that the distinction between the presumption as to felonious receiving and stealing is not a matter of law. Blackburn J. stated that as a proposition of law, there was no presumption that recent possession points more to stealing than receiving. He continued:\nIf a party is in possession of stolen property recently after the stealing, it lies on him to account for his possession, and if he fails to account for it satisfactorily, he is reasonably presumed to have come by it dishonestly; but it depends on the surrounding circumstances whether he is guilty of receiving or stealing. Whenever the circumstances are such as render it more likely that he did not steal the property, the presumption is that he received it.\nOf course, he was concerned only with the charges of stealing and receiving as there was no such offence as retaining known to the law at that time.\nLogically there is as much reason to apply the doctrine to a charge of retaining as to a charge of receiving. It was so held by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in The King v. Lum Man Bow[36], and by this Court in Lopatinsky v. The King[37]. The point may not have been raised in those cases in the same manner as it was presented on this appeal but it was distinctly mentioned in the factum for the Crown, filed in this Court in the Lopatinsky appeal. I agree with the view of Roach J.A. in the Court of Appeal[38] in the present case where he states:\nWhere the charge is retaining the explanation relates to the period of retention in this way and to this extent, that if at the time the accused received the goods he had knowledge that they were stolen, he continued thereafter to have that knowledge, but if at the time he received them he had not that guilty knowledge, there is no presumption that he thereafter acquired it. There is no burden on the accused who is charged with the offence of retaining to do more than give an explanation which might reasonably be true that at the time of receiving the goods he had not the guilty knowledge that they were stolen. Indeed, it is not difficult to think of a case in which a party innocently obtained possession of stolen goods and, apart from giving an explanation of the circumstances in which those goods came into his possession, he could do no more.\nFrom the foregoing it follows that if an accused stands charged with both receiving and retaining stolen goods an explanation which rebuts the presumption on the receiving charge also rebuts it on the retaining charge and in the absence of other evidence establishing guilty knowledge at the time of receiving, he is entitled to an acquittal on that charge and in the absence of evidence establishing that after having received them he acquired knowledge that they were stolen, he is entitled to an acquittal on the retaining charge.\nThe second point raised by the appellant is that the trial judge having acquitted the accused of the charge of receiving could not, in the circumstances, convict him of retaining. However, it is not as if the trial judge had stated that he had accepted the explanation offered on behalf of the accused and therefore dismissed the charge of receiving, in which case it might be argued that there was nothing upon which he could base the conviction for retaining. In the circumstances existing in the present case, the fact that for some unexplained reason the appellant was found not guilty of receiving does not prevent a verdict of guilty of retaining. The rejection of the explanation permits the doctrine of recent possession to apply to the charge of retaining. It should be added that not only is there evidence upon which the trial judge could determine that the explanation was not reasonable but it appears that was the only proper conclusion.\nThe third point raised, that an accused person cannot be convicted of both offences, receiving and retaining, does not arise since the appellant was found not guilty of receiving.\nThe appeal should be dismissed. The judgment of Taschereau and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014It appears necessary, in view of the arguments raised in this appeal, to deal, at first, with the true legal notion of the offence or offences, created by the Canadian Parliament, in s. 399 of the Criminal Code, and then, consider the evidence on record and the conviction of retaining which is questioned by this appeal.\nAs to the first point.\nBy\u2014and ever since\u2014the enactment of the Criminal Code of Canada, retaining, as well as receiving, goods obtained by theft, knowing them to have been so obtained, constitutes a criminal offence in Canada. In this respect and since 1892, the Canadian law is at variance with the English law, wherein only the act of receiving, and not the act of retaining, constitutes an offence.\nOne of the consequences of this change and this difference in the two laws is that the cases decided in England,\u2014where the occasion to discuss and apply a provision similarly worded as s. 399 never arose,\u2014do not and cannot offer a precise and exhaustive definition of receiving and of retaining, both standing in relation to one another, as they do in s. 399.\nBut an important feature of the change, with respect to the real import of the section, stems from the very process by which it was accomplished. For this change in the law was not achieved by amendment, but by a codification of what became the main body of the Canadian Criminal Law, a law flowing from sources different in nature and origin. This very fact brings to the fore the rule of interpretation related to codification, according to which resort must not be had to the law pre-existing the codified law, unless the provisions of the latter be obscure and ambiguous.\nThus, to gather the true legal notion of the provisions of s. 399, the \u201cproper course\u201d\u2014in the very words of Lord Halsbury, L.C., in Bank of England v. Vagliano Brothers[39], at page 151:\n* * * is in the first instance to examine the language of the statute and to ask what is its natural meaning, uninfluenced by any considerations derived from the previous state of the law, and not to start with inquiring how the law previously stood, and then, assuming that it was probably intended to leave it unaltered, to see if the words of the enactment will bear an interpretation in conformity with this view.\nBut whether or not this rule is applied\u2014and I can think of no reasons why it should not in the case under consideration\u2014I fail to see what the difficulty is with respect to the first point, i.e., what facts may constitute an offence under the provisions of the section.\nIn the very terms of the provision under our law, everyone commits an indictable offence who:\n(a) \u201cRECEIVES or RETAINS in his possession * * *\u201d\n(b) \u201c* * * anything obtained by any offence punishable on indictment, or by any acts wheresoever committed, which, if committed in Canada, would have constituted an offence punishable upon indictment\n(c) \u201c* * * KNOWING such thing to have been so obtained.\u201d\nThe natural meaning of this language is clear and non-ambiguous.\nIn (a):\u2014If the evidence indicates the reception, on a charge of receiving, or the retention, on a charge of retaining, the first element, respective to each case, is fully established. This conclusion is equally true if, on either charge, both the reception and the retention are shown in the evidence; for\u2014as far as the evidence is concerned\u2014the question in each case, is not related to superabundance but only to sufficiency of the proof. Indeed, and in fact, less frequent may be the cases\u2014but there are\u2014where the one who receives does not retain, at least for some measurable time. The case of Milton v. The King[40] is a case in point. Equally, accidental may be the cases where a person who retains dishonestly, has received honestly, even though he had throughout the knowledge that the goods were stolen. This is illustrated by the case of Rex v. Matthews[41]. Again and by the mere operation of s. 69 or others, one may in law, if not in fact, retain without having first received. The difficulty there may be in certain cases,\u2014where, as an illustration, the reception and the retention amount to one single transaction\u2014to determine when the reception ceases and when the retention begins, is one related to evidence and not to substantive law.\nIn my view, this element in (a), while being worded in all-embracing, but not obscure nor confusing terms, is clear evidence of the will of the Canadian Parliament to cover in the most complete and effective manner the case of possession, at both reception and retention time.\nIn (b):\u2014No discussion arises in this case.\nIn (c):\u2014The third element which, as the second, is common to receiving and retaining, is the guilty knowledge. The words in the enactment are \u201cknowing such thing to have been so obtained\u201d. The guilty knowledge must then co-exist with possession,\u2014and this statutory requirement is fully satisfied if it does\u2014(1) at the time of reception, on a charge of receiving, or (2) at any time during the period of retention, on a charge of retaining. In this respect, receiving and retaining are distinguishable as criminal offences. And once an accused is proved to have received or retained anything, obtained in any of the manners indicated in (b), the question is:\u2014Did he, (1) at the time of receiving or (2) at any time during the period of retaining, or (3) throughout the whole period of his possession, have the knowledge that the thing was so illegally obtained?\nAn affirmative answer to (1), or (2), or (3) undoubtedly establishes clear guilt and certainly makes the accused amenable to justice, for receiving in (1), for retaining in (2), or either of them in (3); for in each case, the elements of guilt, as enacted by Parliament, are present.\nIndeed and in the third alternative, guilty knowledge co-exists with both the reception and the retention of the possession. The fact that the evidence on a charge of retaining would indicate that the guilty knowledge proven to exist during the retention, would have equally preexisted to it, or the fact that the evidence on a charge of receiving would indicate that the guilty knowledge, proven to exist at the time of reception, would not have ceased to exist but continued thereafter, cannot alter but only strengthen, in each case, the proof of the co\u2011existence of the guilty knowledge with possession. For the enactment merely says \u201cknowing the same to have been so obtained\u201d. No matter then, since when, on a charge of retaining, or how long after, on a charge of receiving, does the guilty knowledge co-exist with possession, provided it does at any time during retention, on the former, or at the time of reception, on the latter. To import in the section any like questions as to the duration of the knowledge is, in my view, adding to the word \u201cknowing\u201d\u2014the most essential word in the entire section\u2014a qualification expressly rejected from the provision by the very word itself.\nIn brief, the section provides, as it was decided in several Canadian cases, for two distinct offences, the first being receiving and then the second being retaining anything illegally obtained, knowing it to have been so obtained.\nWith respect to punishment, the inescapable consequence of the distinction between the two offences is that the sentence stated in the section is the authorized punishment for the commission of either of the two offences therein created.\nIt is from the latter conclusion\u2014which is not disputed\u2014that stem the following argument and conclusion made on behalf of the appellant.\nIt is said that Parliament never intended that, in addition to a penalty for receiving, the accused should be liable to a further penalty if, after so acquiring stolen goods, he retains them. On the basis, and as a result of this assumption, another and a new concept of the offence of retaining is advanced and concluded to be the one meant by the language of the section. It is suggested that retaining stolen goods, knowing them to have been stolen, ceases to be the offence of retaining once the evidence, establishing a guilty knowledge during retention, also indicates that this guilty knowledge was gained at the time of reception of the stolen goods or, to put it with more precision, that the guilty knowledge in retaining must be\u2014and, therefore, must be proved to be\u2014not only subsequent to reception but exclusively so.\nOne would observe, at first, that this concept of retaining\u2014in support of which no precedent has been found to exist\u2014rests on the limited consideration of a case where receiving and retaining amount to a continuous or a single transaction. It would nevertheless, if accepted, affect the infinite variety of cases where retaining or receiving may, in fact and in law, not amount to a continuous or single transaction. This, particularly in view of the clear language of the section, calls for the necessity of examining both the assumption and the conclusion advanced on behalf of the appellant.\nAs to the first.\nWhether or not Parliament intended, in the particular case above stated, that an accused should be liable to two penalties, is a matter that we are not called upon to decide in this case. In all the reported cases where the occasion to decide the question could have arisen, one penalty only was given, or if two were stated, they were made concurrent. I fail nonetheless to appreciate how a negative answer to the question could afford a valid criterion for the interpretation of the section. For the fact that a man may not be punished twice for the same offence does not necessarily import that he may not twice be prosecuted on a different charge setting up another legal aspect of the same facts. S. 15 of the Criminal Code supports that proposition.\nAs to the conclusion of the new definition.\nWith deference, I am unable to agree with the view that while, admittedly, the offence of retaining must, as one of its elements, include the guilty knowledge at some time while the possession is being retained, it must also exclude it at the time when possession is gained. I can think of no case where Parliament states\u2014except in express language\u2014the elements of a crime in maximum or exclusive terms and where, as a consequence, evidence must be made to exclude certain facts in order to reach the degree of certainty required for a conviction in criminal matters. Receiving and retaining, in s. 399, are certainly not described in such a manner. Strange and most technical, I think, it would be (a) if a person accused of retaining, could, having admitted the existence of the guilty knowledge during the retention, plead successfully that this knowledge had been already gained by him at the very time the goods were received; or, conversely, (b) if a person, accused of receiving, could plead successfully on that charge, that the guilty knowledge existing, at the time he gained possession, continued thereafter with the retention of the possession. Under the authorities where possession is proved to be recent in relation to theft, a presumption arises that the possessor came by the goods dishonestly. If, consequently, the above definition of retaining is accepted, this presumption of fact could, by itself, defeat the case of the prosecution on a charge of retaining, where the evidence indicates recent possession.\nThat the evidence, in some cases, may, on either charge, indicate the elements of both crimes is certain, but, if it does, I can find no justification to say that one of either the charge of receiving or the charge of retaining should have been preferred, by preference to the other.\nFor these reasons, I am not only unable to conclude that the above contention, made on behalf of the appellant, casts any obscurity or ambiguity on the natural meaning of the provision, but I am convinced that, if accepted, it would directly defeat the only import of the word knowing.\nDealing now with the second point, i.e., the evidence on record with respect to the conviction of retaining in the present appeal.\nIn the present case, the evidence revealed particularly the following facts: On the 16th of January 1950, the residence of one Burruss was broken into and entered; certain chattels, including a Remington repeating shot-gun and a Remington repeating rifle were stolen therefrom; having gained possession of these weapons, the appellant gave the rifle\u2014valued at sixty-eight dollars\u2014to an immediate neighbour, one Enge, with instructions to sell it, at a price left at the latter\u2019s discretion, provided that out of the proceeds of the sale, twenty dollars would be remitted to the appellant; the other gun was still in the possession of the latter, on the 25th of February 1950, when it was seized in execution of a search warrant.\nThus the appellant\u2014even on the theory of a defence\u2014did, as a fact, receive and retain possession of stolen goods. Of this there is no dispute.\nThe only point in issue is related to the third element, i.e., the guilty knowledge of the appellant.\nOne cannot in fact\u2014even if he may in law\u2014retain possession of a thing without having first gained possession of the same. Thus, on a charge of retaining, in order to decide whether the retaining is honest or dishonest, it becomes not only pertinent and material but essential to consider whether there is any admissible evidence in the case indicating that the accused had or had not the guilty knowledge when he gained possession.\nFor once the character of this original possession is, in a given case, ascertained by direct or circumstantial evidence, as being dishonest or not proved to be such, the character of this original possession cannot suddenly change without further evidence of some subsequent intervening fact altering it. Thus, and in the absence of any such subsequent fact, if the knowledge is shown by the evidence to be dishonest at the time when possession is gained, no presumption arises that it becomes honest during retention; and conversely, if the knowledge is proved to be honest\u2014or not proved to be dishonest\u2014at the time the accused gained possession, no presumption can either arise, without such subsequent fact, that this knowledge at the time possession was gained became dishonest during the period possession was retained.\nKnowledge is a matter of fact and the proof of its character is not dependent on the nature of the charge laid but on the very nature of the facts disclosed in the evidence.\nAmongst the methods of proving the guilty knowledge, the doctrine of recent possession must be considered. Thus, any person, found in possession of stolen goods, is presumed to have come by them dishonestly if such possession is recent in relation to the theft; or, as was said by the Lord Chief Justice in Rex v. Powell[42], at page 2:\u2014\nThe possession of recently stolen property throws on the possessor the onus of shewing that he got it honestly.\nThe presumption being applied in the case of an indictment with a count of theft and a count of receiving, the jurisprudence is that in the absence of any explanation which might reasonably be true, the accused may\u2014but must not necessarily\u2014be found guilty of either theft or receiving. But the presumption itself is one of fact and not one of law. Again, it is not dependent on the charge laid, but it rests solely on the fact that the possession of the stolen goods is recent in relation to the theft thereof. The guilty knowledge is then presumed. The fact that there are no authorities in England indicating that the presumption arising from recent possession would apply to what is a case of retaining under the Canadian law, is of no significance in the present discussion but is only consistent with the other fact that the offence of retaining as we have it under the Code, is not known in England.\nThat the complete doctrine of recent possession has been applied in Canada on a charge of retaining, is clearly evidenced by the following decisions: The Supreme Court of Canada in Lopatinsky[43]; The Ontario Court of Appeal in Rex v. Tuck[44]; The British Columbia Court of Appeal in The King v. Lum Man Bow[45]. And in no reported cases, anywhere in Canada, was it said that the presumption is inapplicable on a charge of retaining.\nIn the present case, it is granted that the possession by the appellant of the stolen guns was recent in relation to the theft thereof. Thus, this sole fact, conditioning the play of the presumption, being established, the appellant is therefore presumed to have come by these guns dishonestly. This is a rule of evidence and not of substantive law.\nFurther, there is nothing in the evidence indicating that this original guilty knowledge was subsequently changed to become honest during the period of time covered by the count of retaining, in the charge sheet.\nThe accused was jointly tried on four counts, the third being for receiving and the fourth for retaining. At no time did he ask for a separate trial on each or any of these counts. And, in the evidence common to all counts and admissible in each, appears an explanation, not only as to how the appellant gained possession of the stolen guns but how he dealt with each of them thereafter. This explanation was not accepted by the trial judge, and was qualified as \u201cpreposterous\u201d by all the members of the Court of Appeal. In the views of both Courts, the presumption that the accused came by these guns dishonestly had not been rebutted. It was open, therefore, to the trial judge to decide, as he did, that the guilty knowledge existing at the time the appellant gained possession of these guns continued while he retained them, for there was no evidence of any subsequent fact affecting the dishonest character of the original possession. On the contrary, the facts subsequent to the time the accused gained possession of the guns, added to the presumption, resulting from the recent possession, that he came by them dishonestly, were only capable of strengthening this guilty knowledge during the time of retention. Thus, (a) the appellant sold one of the two guns which the alleged unknown hunters were supposed to claim back, (b) the sale was made at a ridiculous price left, besides, to the discretion of a neighbour to whom the gun was entrusted; (c) these alleged hunters unknown to the appellant were never heard of though two months had elapsed when the seizure of the last gun took place.\nIt is true that the learned trial judge acquitted the appellant on the charge of receiving\u2014one is not bound to convict on the strength of the presumption alone, the rule is \u201cmay\u201d but not \u201cmust\u201d find guilt,\u2014and found him guilty on the charge of retaining. This leads the appellant to argue that, there being no other evidence as to the guilty knowledge but the presumption arising from recent possession, the acquittal on receiving was evidence that the trial judge accepted the explanation of the defence as to recent possession.\nNo doubt that, having been acquitted of receiving, the appellant could, on a fresh indictment for the same offence, plead autrefois acquit. But to say that, on the basis of this acquittal on receiving, one must conclude that on the consideration of the charge of retaining, the trial judge accepted the explanation of the appellant when, in too concise oral reasons for judgment but yet in unmistakable terms, he effectively said he did not, does not follow. It may be that, had the verdict been given by a jury or had the trial judge given no reasons, the appellant could have invoked the decision rendered in the Quinn case[46], a decision resting on what is still a conflicting view of the law in Canada. See Rex v. Bayn[47]; L. v. The King[48]. But again, and in the present instance, the trial judge plainly said he did not accept the explanation. The presumption was not rebutted and it was open to the trial judge to decide as he did. In support of the appellant\u2019s contention on this last point, the case of Leonard Edward Ernest Christ[49], was quoted. In my view, this case is not only distinguishable from the present one, but is rather conclusive against the theory advanced on behalf of the appellant. The ratio decidendi in that appeal is to be found behind the verdict. It rests on a consideration of the evidence made in the light of the summing up. It is expressed in these terms by Devlin J.: \u201cIt is impossible to believe that the jury could have accepted the evidence of the police, upon which alone they would be justified in convicting him of receiving, and that at the same time rejected it, or not accepted it, in the case of larceny.\u201d In that case, there was no alternative. The police could not, at the same time, be believed and disbelieved.\nOn the contrary, there is an alternative open to a judge or a jury when the presumption of guilt, arising from recent possession, is actually found to be unrebutted. Upon such unrebutted presumption, there may, or may not, be a verdict of guilty. Again, the doctrine is not that the judge \u201cmust\u201d but that he \u201cmay\u201d convict upon it. The essential point in the present appeal is that there is no place for speculation as to what the finding of fact of the trial judge was in this respect for he clearly stated he did not accept the explanation. This was a finding of fact and even if it may be stated that his conclusion or the verdict he rendered on the charge of receiving, did not follow from this finding of fact, this can hardly supply a valid reason to adopt, on the consideration of the charge of retaining, a conclusion which, again, would not follow from this particular finding of fact further supplemented with evidence of circumstances subsequent to the time of reception of the guns.\nFurthermore, even on the basis of the proposition propounded on behalf of the appellant,\u2014a proposition which, with deference, I do not accept\u2014that in a case of retaining, the guilty knowledge must be exclusively subsequent to receiving, the oral judgment of the trial judge fully justifies the conclusion that on his view of the evidence, there was no doubt that the appellant had the guilty knowledge during the period of retention of the guns, even if he did not have it at the time he received them. While each case must be determined according to its own factual and legal features, in the circumstances of the instant case I agree with the conclusion reached in the unanimous judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal that the conviction on the count of retaining should stand.\nThe appeal, consequently, should be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock, Locke and Cartwright, JJ. was delivered by:\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014The appellant was charged in the County Court Judge\u2019s Criminal Court with (a) breaking and entering by day the dwelling house of one Grayson D. Burruss and the theft therefrom of certain guns and other articles, (b) breaking and entering by night the said dwelling house with intent to commit theft therein, (c) receiving a shotgun and rifle, property of the said Burruss, knowing the same to have been stolen, and (d) retaining in his possession the said shotgun and rifle, knowing the same to have been stolen.\nHe was acquitted on the first three charges but was convicted on the charge of retaining, his appeal with respect to this charge being dismissed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The appellant now appeals to this court, by leave, upon the following questions of law:\n(a) The doctrine of recent possession does not apply to a charge of retaining stolen goods.\n(b) The learned trial judge, having acquitted the accused on a charge of receiving, could not, in the circumstances of the case, convict him on a charge of retaining.\n(c) An accused person cannot be convicted on both the offences of receiving and retaining.\nThe charge of receiving of which he was acquitted was as follows:\nThat the said John Clay, at the Township of North York and elsewhere within the County of York, in the months of January and February in the year 1950, received in his possession a Remington repeating shotgun and a Remington repeating rifle, the property of Grayson D. Burruss, and therefore stolen, knowing the same to have been so stolen, contrary to the Criminal Code. The charge which is the subject matter of this appeal is\nAnd further, that the said John Clay, at the Township of North York and elsewhere within the County of York, in the months of January and February in the year 1950, retained in his possession a Remington repeating shotgun and a Remington repeating rifle, the property of Grayson D. Burruss, and theretofore stolen, knowing the same to have been stolen, contrary to the Criminal Code.\nThis last mentioned offence was for the first time made an offence in Canada under that name in 1892 when the Criminal Code was first enacted by 55-56 Vict. c. 29, s. 314 (now s. 399). The words, \u201cor retains in his possession,\u201d were not in the bill as originally drafted, but were apparently added between second and third readings. The same words were also placed in s. 315 (now s. 400) and in the early part of s. 316 (now 401), but were omitted, perhaps by oversight, in the latter part of that section.\nAs to the offence of receiving stolen property with knowledge that it had been stolen, it was said by Avory J. in Rex v. Norris[50], that the offence of \u201creceiving\u201d is one of the most simple in the criminal law. \u201cThe essence of the charge is that the defendant should be proved to have known at the time\u201d that the property had been stolen. The learned judge also said that, \u201cGenerally, it is enough to say that it is not a crime merely to be in possession of stolen property.\u201d So much is this so, even with knowledge of their stolen character, that in R. v. Tennet[51], the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed a conviction on the charge of receiving because the trial judge, in the course of his summing up to the jury, had said that the Crown had to prove that the accused knew the goods were stolen at the time he received them \u201cor had them in his possession.\u201d\nKnowledge, then, at the time the accused person comes into possession of the goods is the essence of the charge of receiving, and if the element of knowledge at that time be lacking, it will not do, in order to support a charge of receiving, to show that the goods were kept after guilty knowledge subsequently acquired; R. v. Johnson[52]. In fact, even though at the very time of receipt the accused person knows that the goods are stolen, but then intends to turn them over to the police, although he subsequently changes his mind, the offence of \u201creceiving\u201d is not made out; R. v. Matthews[53].\nAs s. 402 provides, the act of receiving is complete as soon as the offender has possession or control over the goods, or aids in concealing or disposing of them. Merely because, however, the goods may remain in the possession of the offender, does not render the offence any the less that of receiving, the essence of the offence being, as already pointed out, not length of possession but knowledge of the stolen character of the goods at the time possession is acquired. It is of interest to observe in this connection that the old form of indictment against a receiver, as set out in Taschereau\u2019s Criminal Acts (1888) p. 444, was\n\u201cthat A.B.,\u2026 did receive and have\u2026\u201d\nWhen, therefore, Parliament added the words, \u201cretains in his possession\u201d anything obtained by any offence punishable on indictment \u201cknowing such thing to have been so obtained,\u201d it could hardly have intended to have constituted a new and additional offence to be made out by mere continuance of possession for some \u201cmeasurable interval of time\u201d (to use the language of Roach J.A. in the court below) after receipt, as this ground was already covered by the offence of \u201creceiving.\u201d Parliament must have intended to create an offence distinct from that of receiving, and as the latter includes all cases in which guilty knowledge was acquired at the time of the receipt of the goods, the offence of \u201cretaining\u201d can only arise where that element is lacking but where knowledge of their stolen character is subsequently acquired and the goods are kept thereafter. It has been so held in R. v. Yeaman[54], a decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal; R. v. Searle[55], a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta; Frozocas v. The King[56], and Ecrement v. The King[57], both decisions of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, of the Province of Quebec. I think the offence of retaining is correctly described in R. v. Searle by Harvey C.J.A. at p. 128:\nSection 399 makes one \u201cwho receives or retains\u201d guilty of an offence. One may receive stolen goods not knowing them to be stolen and subsequently learning that they were stolen may retain them and thereby become guilty of \u201cretaining\u201d though he could not be found guilty of \u201creceiving\u201d.\nThese two different offences are very clearly described by Walsh J. in the Frozocas case at p. 331, as follows:\nIt is true that an accused may be guilty of receiving goods stolen; he may also innocently receive the stolen goods, and become guilty of retaining them later, when he will have acquired knowledge of their unlawful source. Section 399, Cr. Code, was amended to cover the latter offence.\nIn the case with which the court was there concerned, it was contended that the conviction of the appellant was illegal because it condemned him for having committed two distinct offences; first, for having received the goods knowing them to have been stolen, and second, for having retained them with the same knowledge. Notwithstanding the form of the information and conviction, the evidence in the case was all directed to establishing guilty knowledge at the time of the actual receipt of the goods. With respect to the objection to the conviction, Walsh J. had this to say:\nThough s. 399 speaks of receiving and retaining, and though these may indicate at times separate offences, yet there are also times, and the present case is to the point, when retaining is a continuation of the act of receiving. In this instance, to have said that the accused retained the goods in question was only surplusage. Howard J. put the point another way at p. 327, referring to the judgment of Harvey C.J.A. in Searle\u2019s case:\nI concur in the opinion expressed by the learned Chief Justice that s. 399 deals with two offences in a case such as he describes, but I have serious doubt that, where an accused has received goods which he knew at the time were stolen and retained them, an indictment to that effect can be said to contain two distinct counts. I am rather disposed to the opinion that in such circumstances, there is but one offence charged\u2014that the acts of receiving and retaining constitute \u201cin substance one transaction, one continuous set of transactions:\u201d Weinbaum v. The King 53 Que. KB. 270.\nLetourneau J. at p. 329 dealt with the matter as follows:\nThe appellant is right in alleging irregularity in the indictment for having received, concealed and kept stolen goods (Rex v. Searle, 51 Can. C.C. 128) in fine when s. 399 of the Cr. Code says, \u201cwho receives or retains in his possession\u2026\u201d but then again it must be said that if we come to the conclusion that a crime of having \u201creceived\u2026 knowing\u201d etc., was committed, this plea in regard to a defect in the form of the complaint, is without any bearing.\nTellier C.J. and Dorion J. concurred.\nIt is plain, therefore, that the difference between these two offences is that, in the case of the offence of retaining, there is an interval of time, however short, between the actual receipt of the goods and receipt of knowledge of their stolen character, during which interval the possession is either an honest possession or the character of this interval is not in question. The answer to the third question of law raised on the appeal is, therefore, that an accused person cannot be convicted of both the offence of receiving and that of retaining the same goods. They are distinct offences and mutually exclusive. No one would suggest, I think, that the thief may be convicted of retaining merely because he keeps possession. I think a similar contention as to the receiver is equally unsound.\nWith respect to the presumption arising from possession of recently stolen goods, Pollock C.B., in his charge to the jury in Regina v. Exall[58], put the matter this way:\nProperty recently stolen, found in the possession of a person, is always presumptive evidence against that person, unless the possession can be accounted for and explained consistently with innocence.\nThe question which arises is as to the offences with respect to the commission of which, such possession is evidence, and that is answered by the learned Chief Baron in the passage immediately following that above quoted, namely,\nThe principle is this, that if a person is found in possession of property recently stolen, and of which he can give no reasonable account, a jury are justified in coming to the conclusion that he committed the robbery.\nAnd so it is of any crime to which the robbery was incident, or with which it was connected, as burglary, arson or murder. For, if the possession be evidence that the person committed the robbery, and the person who committed the robbery committed the other crime, then it is evidence that the person in whose possession the property is found committed that other crime.\nExamples of the application of the presumption in connection with the crimes mentioned are referred to in Taylor on Evidence, 12th Edition, p. 135, and Archbold, 32nd Edition, p, 404.\nThe offence of receiving is, of course, \u201cincident to\u201d or \u201cconnected with\u201d robbery, burglary or theft, as may be also arson and murder, but that is not true of the offence of retaining stolen goods, as the latter is separated from knowledge of the character of the goods by reason of the interval of time already referred to. There is a complete break between the commission of these other offences and that of retaining, while in the case of receiving it is directly connected by reason of the guilty knowledge existing from the moment when the possession of the accused commences. In other words, recent possession implies association with the thief in the particular case. Any such connection in respect of a charge of retaining is, however, excluded by the elements of that offence.\nThe close connection between the offences of theft and receiving is indicated in East\u2019s Pleas of the Crown, Vol. 2, p. 744, in the author\u2019s discussion of earlier legislative attempts to deal with these offences, where he says that the receiver was generally the employer and patron of the thief. In fact, 29 Geo. II c. 30, s. 1, recites that \u201cbuyers or receivers are the principal cause of the commission of such theft.\u201d It may be that this fact entered into the reason for the rule under discussion.\nIn Regina v. Langmead, which is best reported in 1 Le. & Ca. 427, the defendant was indicted on two counts, one for theft and the other for receiving, knowing the goods to have been stolen. Blackburn J. at 437 stated the presumption which arises from the fact of possession, as follows:\nI should have said that recent possession was evidence either of stealing or receiving, according to circumstances, and that, as soon as it was proved that the person in whose possession they were found did not steal them, his possession, if unaccounted for, was evidence that he had received them knowing them to be stolen.\nWhile, as already stated, the offence of retaining stolen goods does not exist in England, the following from the same learned judge in the above case is pertinent with respect to the inapplicability of the presumption to an offence such as retaining. Blackburn J. said at p. 438:\nIf you start with the datum that the prisoner was in possession of the sheep, then, his possession being dishonest, he must have been the receiver, if he was not the thief. As soon as it was shown that the prisoner could not have been the thief, it followed that he was the receiver.\nThis renders the point, in my opinion, very clear. In the case of theft and receiving, the possession of an accused can only be a dishonest possession, the only question to be answered so far as guilt is concerned being whether the accused actually stole the goods himself or received them from another person knowing them to be stolen. But if the character of the original receipt of the goods by the accused is not in question, but he is charged only with having subsequently acquired guilty knowledge, there is no room for the operation of the presumption with which the court in Langmead\u2019s case was concerned, and the Crown must establish affirmatively that such knowledge was in fact acquired. Just as the offence of retaining is itself the creation of statute, a statute would also be required to raise a presumption of guilty knowledge acquired after a receipt the character of which is not in question.\nWhile, as already mentioned, there is no offence in England of retaining stolen goods generally, there has been for a great many years the offence of having possession of military or naval stores marked with His Majesty\u2019s mark. The statute 9-10 Wm. III c. 41 recites by s. 1 that it rarely happens that direct proof can be made that such goods have been stolen, but only that goods so marked were found in the possession of the accused. Section 2 goes on to provide that \u201csuch person or persons in whose custody, possession or keeping such goods or stores, marked as aforesaid\u201d are found, should be liable to conviction. In Regina v. Cohen[59], the defendant was charged on indictment under s. 2 with unlawfully having in his possession certain naval stores marked with the broad arrow. It was held that it was necessary for the Crown to show, not only that the defendant was possessed of the articles, but also that he knew they were marked. Watson B. said at p. 42:\nI am of opinion that it is necessary, in order to convict a person under this statute of having naval stores marked with the broad arrow in his possession, to show not only that he had them in his possession, but that he also knew the nature of the articles, and that they were marked with the broad arrow. The statute is no doubt couched in very general terms; it does not state in so many words that he must have them in his possession \u201cknowingly,\u201d but that must be the true meaning of the statute.\nHill J. said at p. 43 that\nno offence is committed under the second section unless it is shown that the individual in whose possession or custody the goods were knew that they were marked with the broad arrow.\nA similar case under the same statute arose in Regina v. Sleep[60], in which the decision in Cohen\u2019s case was specifically approved. In Sleep\u2019s case, the Crown contended that upon the true construction of the statute a prima facie case was made out by showing that the stores were found in the prisoner\u2019s possession, and that the onus was then cast upon him of \u201cshowing that his possession is innocent.\u201d This contention was negatived, it being held that it was for the Crown to show that the defendant knew that the goods were marked goods. Notwithstanding that the statute said nothing about knowingly, the well settled principle of the criminal law that the defendant must have a guilty mind, rendered it necessary that the principle should be imported into the statute. The principle of this decision is embodied in s. 434 of the Code.\nIn a case such as the present, namely, retaining possession of goods recently stolen, the Crown must prove (a) that the goods were recently stolen, (b) that they were found in the possession of the accused, and (c) that after the accused acquired possession he learned of their stolen character. Just as, in a case arising under 9-10 Wm. III, there is no onus upon the accused to explain anything until the Crown has established not only possession of the marked goods but that the accused knew they were so marked, equally in the case of an offence of retaining stolen goods, the Crown must establish not only possession in the accused but knowledge subsequently acquired of their stolen character. As Roach J.A. himself says in the court below, there is no presumption establishing such knowledge.\nIf it be said that the presumption here under discussion is applicable to a charge of retaining stolen property knowing it was stolen, and that the person accused of that offence must go into the witness box and explain how it was \u201ccome by,\u201d it seems to me that those who so say are also saying something else, namely, that in every charge of retaining there is included a count of receiving, with respect to which the accused must clear himself before the Crown will be called upon to do anything in the way of establishing that after the receipt of the goods the accused learned of their stolen character. From this it follows that if the explanation of the accused as to how he \u201ccame by\u201d the goods is not accepted, he will be convicted, and, as the charge is that of retaining, the conviction will also be called retaining, although in reality, it will be for receiving. Such a procedure merely confuses the two charges which by definition are separate and distinct. If this view were permissible, it is difficult to see why the Crown would lay a charge of receiving in any case.\nAs the Quebec Court of Appeal pointed out in the case of Frozocas, a charge of receiving has nothing added to it by words alleging that the accused retained the goods. On the other hand, if a charge of retaining were drawn expressly so as to include a charge of receiving, it would be bad for multiplicity. I come back to the point that on a charge of retaining as distinct from receiving, the state of mind of an accused person when he received possession of the goods is not in issue. In Rex v. Bond[61], Kennedy J. said at p. 397:\nIt may be laid down as a general rule in criminal as in civil cases that the evidence must be confined to the point in issue: Roscoe\u2019s Digest of the Law of Evidence in Criminal Cases, 12th Ed. (1898) pp. 78, 79. When a prisoner is charged with an offence it is of the utmost importance to him that the facts laid before the jury should consist exclusively of the transaction which forms the subject of the indictment which alone he can be expected to come prepared to answer. It is therefore a general rule that the facts proved must be strictly relevant to the particular charge and have no reference to any conduct of the prisoner unconnected with such charge; therefore, it is not allowable to shew on the trial of an indictment that the prisoner has a generel disposition to commit the same kind of offence as that for which he stands indicted.\nIt is said that the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in The King v. Lum Man Bow[62], was decided in a contrary sense. It is true that the charge in that case was that the accused did \u201cunlawfully retain stolen property in their possession\u201d knowing the same to have been stolen, but when the report is examined, it is plain that the case was treated as one of receiving and that the distinction between the two offences was not in the mind of any of the members of the court. The goods there in question which were stolen on the night of December 3-4, were found, on the afternoon of the 4th, in the possession of the accused who failed, in the language of the stated case, \u201cto give a satisfactory account of how they came by the property.\u201d\nMacdonald C.J.A., with whom Galliher J. concurred, referred, in the course of his judgment, to the argument on behalf of the accused that the only presumption which arose on the facts stated was a presumption that the accused had stolen the property, which excluded the presumption that they had retained it knowing it to be stolen. The learned Chief Justice negatived the contention, stating that in his opinion, the question was fully covered by the decision in Langmead\u2019s case where, he said, \u201cprecisely the same question arose and where the judges were unanimously of the opinion that whenever circumstances are such as to render it likely that the accused did not steal the property, the presumption is that he received it.\u201d The learned Chief Justice went on to say that in the case he was discussing, the charge was for retaining, not receiving, and that he thought the principle, so far as the presumption was concerned, was the same. He said that he adopted the contention of the Crown that the extension of the Code to the offence of retaining \u201cwas, I think, intended, as Mr. Maclean argued, to remedy a defect in the law which failed to reach persons who were indicted for the offence of receiving, but who afterwards were proven to be the thieves. The same person could not be the thief and the receiver, but under the present section he may be convicted notwithstanding that it should turn out on the trial that he had actually stolen the goods.\u201d It is quite evident from this what the idea of the offence of retaining was in the mind of the learned Chief Justice, and that it was not the offence which, in my view was created by the provisions of s. 399. The learned Chief Justice was making two offences out of theft merely from the fact that the person taking the goods did not immediately pass them on. This is the same contention applied to \u201creceiving\u201d with which I have already dealt.\nIt is also quite plain from the judgments of both Irving and Martin JJ.A. that they treated the case with which they were dealing as one of receiving. The latter expressly says that he had no doubt that the conviction of the accused \u201cas receivers\u201d was justified.\nThis case cannot, therefore, be said to be authority for the proposition contended for by the Crown in the case at bar.\nOn behalf of the Crown, we were referred to the decision of this Court in Richler v. The King[63]. A reference to that case shows that the conviction there was for \u201creceiving or retaining,\u201d and there is no discussion in the judgment of retaining as a separate offence. The point here in question was not raised. The Crown also referred us to Lopatinsky v. The King[64], where the conviction was for retaining. Again, however, the distinction between the two offences was not raised, and the evidence in the case was directed entirely to establishing guilty knowledge at the time the goods were received. While the charge there under discussion was one of retaining, the offence actually proved was receiving, and no point was made in the case of any distinction between the two offences. The same is to be said of Rex v. Pomeroy[65]. The appeal to this court was dismissed, but is unreported. I think, therefore, that this court is not hampered by anything said in any of the decisions cited, and that the answer to the first question of law with respect to which leave to appeal was granted should be that the doctrine does not apply. This brings me to the second question.\nIn Regina v. Sleep, ubi cit., appeal was from a conviction under 9-10 Wm. III c. 41, s. 2, for having been found in possession of naval stores marked with the broad arrow. The jury, in answer to questions, found (a) that the goods were so marked, (b) that the prisoner had reasonable means of knowing they were so marked, but (c) that there was not sufficient evidence he did know. The conviction was set aside, notwithstanding that in the opinion of the court on appeal, there was abundant evidence of guilty knowledge, and that the jury ought to have so found.\nIn the case at bar, the appellant has been acquitted on the charge of receiving. In my opinion, he ought to have been convicted on that charge, but there is no appeal as to it, and that being so, there is no longer any question as to the state of mind of the appellant when he obtained possession of the guns here in question. It was for the Crown, therefore, to establish that subsequently, guilty knowledge as to the character of the goods was acquired by the appellant. In my opinion, the respondent failed to do so. It was contended that the fact that the name of the owner was on the case in which one of the guns was contained, was sufficient. Even if this could be said to be sufficient evidence, which I doubt, it is not to be assumed that this fact came to the attention of the accused at all, or did not come to his attention at the time he obtained possession originally. While the learned trial judge was entitled to give consideration to all the evidence when dealing with the charge of retaining, there was, in my opinion, no evidence or no sufficient evidence upon which a conviction on that charge could be supported. I would therefore allow the appeal and set aside the conviction.\nESTEY J.:\u2014The appellant was tried before a judge, sitting without a jury, upon an indictment containing four counts: first, breaking and entering by day and stealing; second, breaking and entering by night with intent to steal; third, that he did receive a shot gun and a rifle, knowing they were stolen; and fourth, that he did retain in his possession the shot gun and rifle, knowing the same to have been stolen. He was found not guilty under counts one, two and three, but guilty under count four of retaining the shot gun and rifle. This conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Court of Ontario.\nThe evidence established the theft of the shot gun and rifle and that they were found in the recent possession of the appellant. The appellant did not give evidence, but his wife was called as a witness on his behalf and gave an explanation as to how the shot gun and rifle had come into the possession of her husband. At the conclusion of the trial the learned trial judge stated, in part:\nI do not think that the explanation offered by the defence, in this matter, is a reasonable explanation and am therefore finding the accused guilty on the evidence, guilty of retaining, and that is guilty on count four.\nCounsel for the accused contends that the presumption arising out of recent possession does not apply to a charge of retaining. S. 399 of the Criminal Code, under which counts three and four were laid, reads as follows:\nEvery one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to fourteen years\u2019 imprisonment, who receives or retains in his possession anything obtained by any offence punishable on indictment, or by any acts wheresoever committed, which, if committed in Canada would have constituted an offence punishable upon indictment, knowing such thing to have been so obtained.\nThe offence of retaining was not known to the common law, nor is it included in any of the British statutory offences. In Canada it was first made an offence by the insertion of the words \u201cor retains\u201d in the section of our Code of 1892 (S. of C. 1892, c. 29, s. 214). The language \u201creceives or retains\u201d in s. 214 (now 399) would indicate an intention on the part of Parliament to treat these offences as separate and distinct. Such an intention is emphasized by the provision in s. 402 in which it is provided that the act of receiving is completed as soon as the person has possession or control over the property. This section has been so construed in Canada. Rex v. Yeaman[66]; Rex v. Searle[67]; Frozocas v. The King[68]; Ecrement v. The King[69].\nThe issue here raised was decided adversely to the contention of counsel for the appellant by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in The King v. Lum Man Bow[70]. The Court of Appeal of Ontario, in affirming the conviction of the appellant, expressly concurred in the view expressed in The King v. Lum Man Bow. The British Columbia Court of Appeal based its conclusions largely upon the decision in Reg. v. Langmead[71]. In the Langmead case the accused was charged with both stealing and receiving and his counsel submitted that, as the evidence proved no more than recent possession by the prisoner, the jury should have been directed that they could not lawfully find the prisoner guilty of receiving. This contention was rejected. Pollock, C.B. stated:\n* * * the distinction taken by Mr. Carter between a charge of stealing and one of receiving, with reference to the effect of evidence of recent possession, is not the law of England. If no other person is involved in the transaction forming the subject of the inquiry, and the whole of the case against the prisoner is that he was found in the possession of the stolen property, the evidence would, no doubt, point to a case of stealing rather than a case of receiving; but in every case, except, indeed, where the possession is so recent that it is impossible for any one else to have committed the theft, it becomes a mere question for the jury whether the person found in possession of the stolen property stole it himself or received it from some one else. If, as I have said, there is no other evidence, the jury will probably consider with reason that the prisoner stole the property; but, if there is other evidence which is consistent either with his having stolen the property, or with his having received it from some one else, it will be for the jury to say which appears to them to be the more probable solution.\nBlackburn, J. stated:\nI do not agree with Mr. Carter in thinking that recent possession is not as vehement evidence of receiving as of stealing. When it has been shewn that property has been stolen, and has been found recently after its loss in the possession of the prisoner, he is called upon to account for having it, and, on his failing to do so, the jury may well infer that his possession was dishonest, and that he was either the thief or the receiver according to the circumstances.\nIn Great Britain where, as already stated, there is no offence of retaining, the courts have held that recent possession of stolen property raises a prima facie case or a presumption to the effect that the accused knew the goods were stolen when he received them. The further question of whether recent possession should raise a presumption to the same effect when the offence charged is retaining has, in Great Britain, never been considered. It would appear, therefore, that in Canada, where the offence of retaining is contained in the Criminal Code, the answer to the question must be found in an examination of the nature and character of the presumption as well as the offence of retaining, and the purpose and object Parliament had in enacting the same, with a view to ascertaining whether the presumption should be applied to the offence of retaining as well as to that of receiving, just as in Reg. v. Langmead it was held that the presumption applied to receiving as well as to theft. In Reg. v. Exall[72], the charge was burglary. Pollock, C.B. stated to the jury:\nThe principle is this, that if a person is found in possession of property recently stolen, and of which he can give no reasonable account, a jury are justified in coming to the conclusion that he committed the robbery. And so it is of any crime to which the robbery was incident, or with which it was connected, as burglary, arson or murder. For, if the possession be evidence that the person committed the robbery, and the person who committed the robbery committed the other crime, then it is evidence that the person in whose possession the property is found committed that other crime.\nThe law is, that if, recently after the commission of the crime, a person is found in possession of the stolen goods, that person is called up to account for the possession, that is, to give an explanation of it, which is not unreasonable or improbable.\nWills on Circumstantial Evidence, 7th Ed., pp. 93 and 94:\nSince the desire of dishonest gain is the impelling motive to theft and robbery, it naturally follows that the possession of the fruits of crime recently after it has been committed, affords a strong and reasonable ground for the presumption that the party in whose possession they are found was the real offender unless he can account for such possession in some way consistent with his innocence * * * The force of this presumption has been recognized from the earliest times; and it is founded on the obvious consideration, that if such possession had been lawfully acquired, the party would be able, at least shortly after its acquisition, to give an account of the manner in which it was obtained; and his unwillingness or inability to afford such explanation is justly regarded as amounting to strong self-condemnatory evidence.\nRoscoe\u2019s Criminal Evidence, 15th Ed., p. 22:\nIt has already been stated that possession is presumptive evidence of property; but where it is proved, or may be reasonably presumed, from the proved circumstances, that the property in question is stolen, the onus probandi is shifted, and the possessor, to rebut an accusation, is bound to explain reasonably that he came by it honestly; and if he fail to do so, the presumption is that he is the thief or the receiver, according to the circumstances.\nThe foregoing quotations indicate that the presumption of recent possession has no statutory origin, but has developed in the common law on the basis that reason and experience may justify a conclusion of guilt where the recent possession of stolen property remains unexplained. The nature and purpose of such a presumption is emphasized by Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence, p. 314:\nPresumptions are aids to reasoning and argumentation, which assume the truth of certain matters for the purpose of some given inquiry. They may be grounded on general experience, or probability of any kind; or merely on policy and convenience.\nThis presumption of recent possession is applied where a party has been found in possession of stolen property so recently in relation to the time of the theft thereof that reason and experience lead to the conclusion that he may either be a party to the theft or has possession of the property with knowledge of its theft. It is of the utmost importance to keep in mind that the Crown must first prove that the property has been stolen and then that it was found in possession of the accused. It is not, however, the mere possession, but rather the recent possession in relation to the time of the theft, that raises the presumption and which presumption is rebutted by a reasonable explanation of honest possession. If the possession of stolen property is not found to be recent, the presumption does not arise, no matter what the offence charged may be.\nThis presumption of fact has not been restricted in its application to theft and receiving. In Regina v. Exall[73], it was extended to burglary and, as Pollock, C.B. stated, it applies to \u201cany crime to which the robbery was incident, or with which it was connected, as burglary, arson or murder.\u201d In Taylor on Evidence it is pointed out that \u201cThe presumption\u2026 applies to all crimes, even the most penal,\u201d and reference is there made to cases of arson, burglary and murder. Taylor on Evidence, 12th Ed., 135, para. 142. See also Archibald\u2019s Cr. Pl. Evid. & Pr., 32nd Ed., 404.\nIt would appear, having regard to the language of Pollock, C.B. in the Exall case supra, that the offence of retaining, in relation to this presumption, is as \u201cincident\u201d to, or as immediately \u201cconnected\u201d with the theft as receiving. The issues at a trial of theft and receiving are quite different. The Queen v. Lamoureux[74]; R. v. Lincoln[75]. A thief cannot receive from himself\u2026 R. v. Langmead supra; R. v. Exall supra. R. v. Carmichael,[76]; R. v. Brown[77]. The offence of receiving contemplates a person receiving the property after the theft has been completed. Retaining is in exactly the same position except that the retention contemplates an innocent receiving, then subsequently, in any appreciable time, however short, the acquisition of knowledge that the property was stolen, and thereafter a retention of same. When the importance of recent possession in relation to the time of the theft is kept in mind, retaining is as \u201cincident\u201d to, or as \u201cconnected\u201d with the theft as receiving.\nIt has been emphasized that at common law it was only the initial possession to which the presumption was applied, not, however, because of the nature and character of the presumption, but because in the offence of receiving it was only the knowledge at the moment of the initial receipt that was in issue. Upon a charge of receiving an accused might have any amount of subsequent knowledge that the goods were stolen, but, if he received them innocently, at common law he was not guilty of that or of any other offence. This was because of the definition of the offence of receiving and not the nature and character of the presumption, under which an accused found in recent possession of stolen property might be found guilty in the absence of any reasonable explanation on his part. In other words, the presumption was raised against an accused charged with receiving, whether he received the property with knowledge that it had been stolen, or whether he acquired that knowledge subsequently to receiving it and then continued to retain the goods, or, indeed, whether he received and at all times held the property innocently. He could at common law, however, be found guilty only if he acquired the possession with guilty knowledge.\nThe offence under s. 399, without the words \u201cor retaining,\u201d is the common law offence of receiving stolen property. One who was charged with receiving at common law and whose evidence was accepted that he had received the stolen goods innocently, but that subsequently, in no matter how short a time, he acquired knowledge that the property was stolen and still retained it, was not guilty of receiving. Re Richard Johnson[78]; Rex v. Tennet[79]; Rex v. Matthews[80]. The Parliament of Canada concluded that one who retained stolen property, knowing it to have been stolen, committed an offence against society as great as that of the receiver and in 1892, while the bill was passing through Parliament, inserted the words \u201cor retaining\u201d after the word \u201creceiving\u201d in s. 214 (now 399) and placed that offence on the same basis and provided the same punishment therefor as that of one who received the goods knowing they were stolen. It would seem that Parliament, by such an enactment, would intend that the same rules of evidence and presumption should apply to both offences.\nAs already stated, the British Columbia Court of Appeal, in 1910, decided that the presumption of recent possession applied where the indictment charged that the accused retained stolen property knowing the property was stolen. The King v. Lum Man Bow supra. While apparently the question has never been raised in a subsequent case with the clarity here presented by Mr. Dubin, it appears that in all of the reported cases subsequent thereto it has been more or less assumed that the presumption did apply to both receiving and retaining. Rex v. Mandzuk[81]; Rex v. Davis[82]; Rex v. Parker[83]; Rex v. Sullivan and Godbolt[84]; Rex v. Tuck[85]; Rex v. Richler[86]; Rex v. Lopatinsky[87]. It would appear that if Parliament had not intended that this well known presumption, so long established in our law, should apply to retaining as well as to receiving that it would, at some date since 1910, have amended the section by the addition of apt words to that effect.\nReceiving and retaining, as already stated, just as theft and receiving, are separate and distinct offences and an accused, even when the evidence of guilty knowledge is found only in the presumption, can only be found guilty of either theft or receiving, but not both. Upon the same basis an accused cannot be found guilty of receiving and retaining. The Criminal Code contemplates that upon the same facts an accused shall be convicted and suffer but one punishment. If an accused party receives the guilty knowledge coincident with possession of the stolen property, he is guilty of the offence of receiving and not of retaining. If, however, he receives the property and subsequently acquires knowledge that the property was stolen, and thereafter continues to retain same, he is guilty of the offence of retaining. The presumption of recent possession applies to all three of these offences and if counts covering each one are included in the indictment it is for the jury, at the conclusion of the hearing, to find the accused guilty of one or other, or not guilty of all of these offences. Pollock, C.B., in Reg. v. Langmead supra, expresses this view as to theft and receiving, and, following his analogy, if the evidence of guilty knowledge adduced by the prosecution is restricted to that arising out of the presumption of recent possession and no further evidence is adduced, a jury would probably conclude that the accused was guilty of receiving. If, however, there is other evidence, it will be for the jury to say whether the accused be guilty of either receiving or retaining, or not guilty of either.\nWhile the offences of receiving and retaining are separate and distinct, the essential difference is the time of the acquisition of knowledge on the part of the accused. In all other essentials there is no great difference. The existence of the motive for dishonest gain referred to in Wills on Circumstantial Evidence supra as a basis for the presumption is of no greater significance in relation to receiving than to retaining.\nIt would appear, therefore, that the submission that the presumption applies to retaining as well as to receiving is justified in principle. The language adopted by Parliament would seem to have contemplated its application to the offence of retaining, and this view finds support in that Parliament has not, since Lum Man Bow supra was decided in 1910, enacted any amendment in respect of this section.\nThe explanation here given related to the initial reception of the stolen property and was disbelieved by the learned trial judge. With great respect, upon that finding the accused should have been found guilty of receiving. There was no evidence that justified the conclusion that he received the goods without knowledge of their having been stolen and subsequently acquired such knowledge and thereafter continued to retain same. Learned counsel for the Crown suggests that, because the accused sold the rifle for $20, when the evidence disclosed that its replacement cost would be $68, therefore there was an inference of subsequent knowledge, but this he may well have done, because he knew it was stolen when he received it. Certainly there is no fact here established to suggest he received it at any other time. He next drew attention to the fact that the purchaser of the rifle found the owner\u2019s name thereon, which aroused his suspicion and caused him to communicate with the police. The evidence establishes that the name was not at all conspicuous and was only found by the purchaser when he was cleaning the rifle, nor is it suggested throughout the evidence that the accused knew of the presence of that name. Counsel then referred to the fact that the hunters never came back. The difficulty with regard to the hunters is that the only evidence of their existence forms a part of the explanation which the learned trial judge did not believe.\nIn my opinion, with great respect, the evidence here adduced on the part of the Crown justified a conviction for receiving, upon which the learned trial judge acquitted and from which no appeal has been taken and which is, therefore, not before this Court. The evidence does not support a conviction of retaining, as that offence is constituted under s. 399.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed.\nAppeal allowed and conviction set aside.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Kimber & Dubin.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C.P.

Strauss (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nJohn Bowser (Defendant) Defendant.\n1951: June 4; 1951: October 2.\nPresent: Kerwin, Kellock, Estey, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nSale of Goods\u2014Warranty on sale of bull for breeding purposes\u2014Whether related to time of sale or to future.\nThe respondent in November 1948 sold a bull to the appellant under the following written warranty: \u201cThis bull is right and sound in every way to the best of my knowledge, and I guarantee him to be a breeder for you.\u201d The appellant took delivery in Ontario and transported the animal by truck to Virginia, some 800 miles. In April 1949 the appellant for the first time employed the bull for breeding purposes and found it to be suffering from a deformity rendering such use impossible. In an action by the purchaser against the vendor for damages for breach of warranty\nHeld: (Affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario), that the appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin and Estey JJ.\u2014While a warranty may expressly relate to the future, unless it is so expressly stated, the warranty relates to facts as they were at the time of the sale. Ldddard v. Kain, 2 Bing. 183, 130 E.R.; McGill v. Harris, 36 N.S.R. 414; Eden v. Parkison 2 Doug. K.B. 732, 99 E.R. 468; Chapman v. Gwyther L.R. 1 Q.B. 463. Kyle v. Sim [1925] S.C. 425, distinguished. To divide the warranty into the past, present and future, as the appellant sought to do, was not the correct way in which to read it. The words \u201cI guarantee him to be a breeder for you\u201d were not to be viewed as anything more than a warranty that at the date of the sale there was nothing to prevent the bull being a breeder for the appellant. The rejection by the trial judge of the opinion evidence of appellant\u2019s witnesses in favour of the factual evidence and that of respondent\u2019s expert witness, was fully justified. On the proper construction of the warranty, even if the onus were upon the respondent of establishing that any injury was not suffered prior to the sale, and that there was no congenital defect, that onus was met.\nPer Kellock J. The appellant\u2019s contention that the guarantee would have been effective as to the defect in question, if congenital, although becoming patent after the date of the sale, was well founded but appellant failed on the evidence to exclude the possibility of the condition having been brought about by injury subsequent to the sale.\nPer Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. It was not necessary to decide whether on its true construction the warranty related to the future or whether, if it did, it extended so far into the future as April 1949. The breach of warranty which the appellant pleaded and on which he based his case at the trial was not merely that the bull was not a breeder in April 1949, but that the congenital deformity from which it was then suffering made it impossible that it could have ever have served a cow or been a breeder. The respondent met this case by evidence that the bull had served a number of cows in a normal manner and that it had sired a number of calves. There was thus ample evidence to support the finding of the trial judge that the bull conformed to the warranty when delivery was made.\nAPPEAL by special leave of the Court of Appeal for Ontario from the judgment of that Court[1](Henderson and Bowlby JJ.A., Hogg J.A. dissenting) dismissing an appeal by the appellant from the judgment of Barlow J.1.\nJ.D. Arnup K.C. and A.H. Young K.C. for the appellants\u2014The trial judge erred in his interpretation of the warranty and did not consider whether it extended into the future. While a warranty ordinarily applies to conditions existing at the time of the sale, it may also, either by express terms or by implication from the facts, apply to a future time. Benjamin on Sale 7th Ed. (1931) 698; Kyle v. Sim[2]; Natrass v. Nightingale[3]; Wood v. Anderson[4]; Liddard v. Kain[5]. Since the respondent knew the purpose for which the bull was being purchased, the warranty he gave was intended to guarantee the animal\u2019s capacity as a breeder in the future. The words \u201cI guarantee him to be a breeder for you\u201d are not a warranty of a present condition (which was adequately covered by the words \u201cThis bull is right and sound in every way to the best of my knowledge\u201d); they are intended to be a warranty of future performance and to relate to a future time.\nThe learned trial judge did not direct his mind to these implications of the warranty but was content merely to find that the bull conformed to it at the time of the sale. The appellant, having proved the warranty given, and the inability of the bull to serve cows as warranted, established a prima facie case and the onus then shifted to the respondent to show the bull\u2019s incapacity was due to a subsequent accident or some other supervening cause. No evidence was put in by the respondent to satisfy this onus and the trial judge\u2019s statement that \u201cThe bull may very well have suffered an injury resulting in the deformity found by the plaintiff on the long trip to Virginia\u201d, is mere conjecture. The majority in the Court of Appeal made the same error in law in finding that \u201cthe case made for the plaintiff before the learned trial judge was met by the case of the defendant\u201d. The trial judge erred in finding that the bull conformed to the warranty at the time of the delivery and that the deformity might have been caused by injury.\nThe appellant\u2019s witnesses gave expert testimony that the deformity was not and could not have been caused by injury but that it was congenital, rendering the bull incapable of ever serving a female animal. The trial judge was unwilling to accept these statements and the only reason he gave was that they were only opinions, based on premises he did not find impressive. In preference he accepted the evidence of the defendant, his employees and neighbours as to the bull\u2019s breeding capacity, only one of whom could testify that he had ever known of a calf sired by the bull. The proper conclusion was that the bull was incapable of breeding and did not conform to the warranty even at the date of delivery. The evidence of the two veterinaries, the appellant\u2019s expert witnesses, was based on actual examination and was not shaken in cross-examination. The veterinary who gave evidence for the respondent did not see the bull but gave evidence based on certain pictures filed as exhibits and on a summary of the evidence of the two veterinaries who testified for the appellant.\nA.A. Macdonald K.C. for the respondent.\u2014The appellant\u2019s contention that the condition of the animal here in question was congenital signally failed on the evidence. The language used in the warranty is of a kind that a person such as the respondent would normally and naturally use to express a guarantee as to the then existing condition of the animal and such warranty properly interpreted is limited to such a guarantee and is not operative in futuro. The language should be so unequivocal in order to express a guarantee in futuro that the document should not be capable of any other meaning. Chapman v. Gwyther[6]. The normal meaning and effect to be attached to a guarantee, subject to its expressly stipulating otherwise, is that it is limited to the condition of the animal at the time of the sale and delivery. Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England 2nd Ed. Vol. 1, 561; Chapman v. Gwyther (supra); Eden v. Parkison[7]; McGill v. Harris[8]; Cameron v. Mclntyre[9]. On the facts and circumstances shown, it is not reasonable or equitable that the respondent should be taken to have guaranteed or intended to guarantee that the animal would be a good breeder five months after the sale and delivery despite anything that could or might happen to it, either in transit or afterwards. The onus was on the appellant to establish that any injury suffered by the bull occurred prior to the sale and delivery to the appellant, and no evidence of any such injury was adduced. Long v. Byers[10]; Westwood v. McMillan[11]. The order appealed from is right, and the judgment of the trial judge for the reasons given by him, and this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nJ.D. Arnup K.C. in reply.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Estey JJ. was delivered by:\nKERWIN J.:\u2014This is an action for damages for breach of a written warranty dated November 20, 1948, given by the respondent to the appellant on the sale, at that date, of an Aberdeen\u2011Angus bull. The warranty is as follows:\nThis is to certify that the Aberdeen-Angus bull, Blackcap of Maple Gables 23rd\u201485813\u2014has sired calves on my farm. This bull is right and sound in every way to the best of my knowledge, and I guarantee him to be a breeder for you.\nThe appellant immediately took delivery of the bull at the respondent\u2019s farm near Newmarket, Ontario, and transported it and two other animals in a truck to his farm in Virginia, a distance of 700 or 800 miles, arriving there November 27, 1948. The bull was purchased for breeding but was not used for the purpose until about April 1, 1949, when it was discovered that it then had a deformity which prevented its use as intended.\nWhile a warranty may expressly relate to the future, as when the seller undertakes to deliver horses sound at the end of a fortnight, unless it is so expressly stated, the warranty relates to facts as they were at the time of sale: Liddard v. Kain[12]. Counsel for the appellant did not deny that a warranty ordinarily applied to conditions existing at the time of the sale but contended that the warranty in the present case applied to the future, relying upon the decision of the Court of Session in Kyle v. Sim[13]. There the warranty upon the sale of a dairy cow read as follows:\u2014\u201dDairy cattle are warranted to calve at their proper time and correct in their teats only.\u201d The cow calved at her proper time but, owing to disease which appeared in her teats, her milk supply was defective. That was an entirely different case. He also referred to Natrass v. Nightingale[14], where the defendant sold the plaintiff a stallion warranting him to be a good coverer and foal-getter, and the animal turned out useless as a foal-getter.\nOn the other hand, counsel for the respondent cited three cases. In McGill v. Harris[15], the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on appeal affirmed the judgment for the defendant on an action on a warranty which warranted a horse:\u2014\nto be sound, and without vice fault or tricks, and a good driving horse in harness for the purposes for which plaintiff desired said horse, which purposes were made known to the defendant at the time of said sale, and before said sale was completed.\nThere the evidence showed that for a period of eight years prior to the sale, the horse was without fault or tricks but that immediately afterwards, in the hands of the plaintiff, it balked and kicked when in harness and was useless for the purpose for which it was purchased. It was held that the warranty applied only to conditions existing at the time of the sale. In Eden v. Parkison,[16], Lord Mansfield remarked that there was no doubt that you might warrant a future event but that the question was what was the meaning of the policy of insurance there in question and he concluded that the warranty was that \u201cthings stand so at the time; not that they shall continue.\u201d\nThe third case is Chapman v. Gwyther[17], where the warranty read:\u2014\u201cWarranted sound. Warranted sound for one month,\u201d and it was held that the last sentence meant not that the horse was warranted to continue sound for a month but that the duration of the warranty was limited to one month, and that complaint of unsoundness must be made within one month of sale: At page 467, Blackburn J. states:\u2014\nThe words clearly admit of that construction, and taking the general rule, we are to consider what the intention is as expressed by the words used, not as used by anybody, but as used by parties dealing in transactions like the present.\nHe had already pointed out that the opposite construction would make the bargain a most improvident one and a very unlikely one for any one to enter into.\nAll of these cases recognize the general rule but were determined upon their particular circumstances. However, I think the remarks of Blackburn J. in Chapman v. Gwyther are applicable to the present case. The appellant sought to divide the warranty into three separate parts, the past, the present, and future. That is not the correct way in which to read it as I am unable to view the words \u201cI guarantee him to be a breeder for you\u201d as anything more than a warranty that at the date of sale there was nothing to prevent the bull being a breeder for the appellant. Read in that way, these words are not surplusage.\nTwo experts called by the appellant were of opinion that the deformity was congenital and that, therefore, the animal had always been incapable of penetration. On the latter point these witnesses are contradicted by the evidence of the respondent and his herdsman, and of a neighbour who kept the bull from July, 1948, to about the time of sale. From this evidence it appears that for some time prior to November 20, 1948, the bull had performed its function, and had sired calves on the respondent\u2019s farm. As a matter of fact and opinion these witnesses testified that the bull was \u201cright and sound\u201d as of the date of sale. These experts were clearly wrong in their opinion as to the animal\u2019s capabilities up to the time of sale and delivery, and the trial judge\u2019s rejection of their evidence in favour of the factual testimony and that of Dr. McIntosh, an expert called by the respondent, is fully justified. Although Dr. McIntosh had never seen the animal, he gave cogent reasons which the trial judge found compelling, and with which I agree. In his opinion the condition found could have been caused by an injury. In the absence of any evidence as to the conditions under which the bull was transported from Newmarket, and in view of the mistake as to facts on the part of the appellant\u2019s experts, an injury on the trip to Virginia cannot be ruled out.\nOn the proper construction of the warranty, even if the onus were upon the respondent of establishing that any injury was not suffered prior to the sale and that there was no congenital defect, that onus has been met. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014At the time of the sale of the animal here in question on November 20, 1948, the respondent undertook in writing with the appellant that:\n\u201cThis bull is right and sound in every way to the best of my knowledge, and I guarantee him to be a breeder for you.\u201d\nThe appellant did not have occasion to use the bull for the purpose for which he acquired it until April of 1949, when the condition of which he complained at the trial was discovered. The evidence establishes that the condition which was later seen in September 1949 and May 1950 by both the experts called on behalf of the appellant was the same as that observed in April 1949.\nThe case put forward by the appellant in his pleading was that at the date of the sale, the bull was not \u201cthen\u201d sound, but was suffering from the condition complained of, which the pleadings describe as congenital. At the trial the appellant called two professional witnesses who stated that, in their view, the defect was congenital and that the animal had never been capable of siring calves. Both stated that in their opinion the defect was not the result of an injury. On the other hand, an expert called by the respondent, although he had never seen the animal in question and had never seen a condition similar to the defect in question, said that such a condition could be a congenital condition or the result of an injury. He also stated that a bull could suffer from a congenital defect which might not at first render him incapable of siring calves. Evidence called on behalf of the respondent, and accepted by the learned trial judge, established that while in the ownership of the respondent, the animal had in fact sired calves. The appellant\u2019s argument, as disclosed in his factum, was that on the proper construction of the document above set out, the guarantee was not confined to the date of the sale but operated for the future. Counsel contended that it should be found that the condition was not due to injury and, on the basis of Dr. McIntosh\u2019s evidence the defect was congenital even though its operation was delayed until after the appellant had acquired ownership.\nIn my opinion, the statement that \u201cThis bull is right and sound in every way to the best of my knowledge\u201d, means what it says, namely, that so far as the respondent knew, there was no defect in the animal. The additional words \u201cI guarantee him to be a breeder for you\u201d, in my opinion, takes away the effect of the qualification in the earlier language and constitutes an undertaking that, regardless of the respondent\u2019s knowledge, the animal was not in fact suffering from any defect at the date of the sale which could prevent him from being a breeder for the appellant.\nI think, therefore, that the contention of counsel for the appellant referred to above, would be effective but for the fact that I do not think that the evidence sufficiently excludes the possibility of the condition in question having been brought about by injury subsequent to the date of the sale.\nI think, therefore, that the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of Barlow J. whereby the action was dismissed with costs.\nThe action is for damages for breach of a warranty given on the sale of a bull by the respondent to the appellant. The warranty is in writing. It is dated November 20, 1948, the date of the sale. It is addressed to the agent of the appellant, signed by the respondent, and reads as follows:\u2014\nThis is to certify that the Aberdeen-Angus bull, Blackcap of Maple Gables 23rd\u201485813\u2014has sired calves on my farm. This bull is right and sound in every way to the best of my knowledge, and I guarantee him to be a breeder for you. The appellant\u2019s representative took delivery of the bull at the respondent\u2019s farm on or about the date of the sale and title thereupon passed to the appellant. The appellant caused the bull to be transported by truck to his farm in Virginia, a distance of between seven hundred and eight hundred miles. Two other animals were carried in the same truck. The appellant did not attempt to use the bull for breeding purposes until April 1, 1949. Commencing on that date repeated attempts were made but all were unsuccessful. On April 18, 1949, the appellant wrote to the respondent complaining that the bull was not as warranted and was useless as a breeder owing to a malformation of its penis. The respondent\u2019s solicitor replied denying any liability. His letter reads in part:\u2014\nAny guarantee that may have been given concerned the condition of the animal at the time of the purchase by you. Almost six months have elapsed and you will appreciate the fact that much can happen to an animal during this period of time. The animal, in question, was in good condition at the time of its purchase by you. Mr. Bowser has definite evidence that the animal was satisfactory for breeding purposes immediately prior to you purchasing same. It seems to me that the animal must have been injured, either in it being transported from here to your farm or it must have received injury sometime during the past six months.\nThe action was commenced on February 11, 1950.\nThe appellant\u2019s cause of action is put as follows in the statement of claim:\u2014\n3. At the time of the sale the respondent gave a certificate of warranty as to the fitness of the bull for breeding purposes, in these words:\nThis bull is right and sound in every way to the best of my knowledge, and I guarantee him to be a breeder for you.\n4. When purchased, the bull was in a \u201chighly-fitted condition\u201d, i.e. fattened for the show ring, and it was necessary to reduce his weight by 300 pounds, to a normal breeding condition. As the appellant\u2019s breeding season did not begin until April, 1949, the services of the bull were not required at any time until that month.\n5. On the first day of April, 1949, and every day thereafter for two weeks, cows were offered to the bull for service, without success, as the bull was unable to make entry.\n6. On April 14th and September 15th, 1949, and on May 5, 1950, the bull was examined by three veterinary surgeons, all of whom stated that the bull was and had always been incapable of serving cows because of a congenital deformity. In the statement of defence it is alleged that the bull was sound and had no congenital defects and was a breeder at the time of the sale. The statement of defence continues:\n5. The Defendant states that if the Aberdeen-Angus bull, which he sold to the Plaintiff, is not now sound and has congenital defects and is not a breeder, all of which the Defendant does not admit but denies, such conditions arose in the said animal after it was placed in the custody and control of the Plaintiff and consequently are not the responsibility of the Defendant.\n6. The Defendant further submits that if he was notified on or about April 15, 1949 of the said bull being unsound, which the Defendant does not admit but denies, the Plaintiff had released the Defendant from any guarantee or warranty, which he may have made in consequence of the eflux of time between the purchase of the said bull and the time of such notice.\nIn my opinion, it is not necessary to decide whether on its true construction the warranty related to the future or whether, if it did so, it extended so far into the future as April, 1949. The breach of warranty which the appellant assigned in the pleadings and put forward at the trial was not merely that the bull was not a breeder in April, 1949 but that it was then suffering from a congenital deformity which made it impossible that it could ever have served a cow or been a breeder. It at once becomes obvious that if this proved to be the fact the bull could not have complied with the warranty at the date of the sale and could not then, or indeed ever, have been right and sound or a breeder. This was the case which the respondent was called upon to meet. He met it by the evidence of several witnesses, expressly accepted by the learned trial judge, to the effect that the bull had served a number of cows in a normal manner, that it had sired a number of calves including one born as a result of service on November 1, 1948, which was the latest occasion of service deposed to, and that its penis was \u201cperfectly normal\u201d.\nThe learned trial judge found that the bull conformed to the warranty when delivery was made. There was ample evidence to support this finding and it is destructive of the theory that the bull had always been incapable of breeding on which the appellant based his case at the trial.\nThere was no contradiction of the evidence given on behalf of the appellant that from April 1, 1949, the bull had proved incapable of breeding. The explanation suggested by the learned trial judge is that the bull may very well have suffered an injury on the trip by truck to Virginia or during the period between November, 1948, and April 1949. No witness suggested that the condition could have arisen spontaneously during the life of the bull. Only two possible explanations were put forward, one that the condition was congenital, the other that it was the result of injury. While the two veterinary surgeons called by the appellant were of opinion that the condition was not caused by injury and must be congenital it is clear that the learned trial judge did not accept their views. Dr. McIntosh, a veterinary surgeon called by the respondent, was of the opinion that the condition could have resulted from injury. Neither the trucker who transported the bull to Virginia nor the veterinary surgeon who examined the bull in April, 1949, and to whom reference is made in the statement of claim and in the appellant\u2019s letter of April 18, 1949, were called as witnesses. One of the veterinary surgeons called by the appellant had first examined the bull on September 15, 1949, and the other on May 5, 1950. Whatever may be the true construction of the warranty, I do not think that the respondent could be charged with a breach thereof if the bull was \u201cright and sound in every way\u201d and \u201ca breeder\u201d at the time of delivery but later ceased to be so because of an injury suffered after delivery when it was owned by and in the possession of the appellant, and this is the only theory on which its condition at the time of the trial can be reconciled with the finding of the learned trial judge that it conformed with the warranty at the time of delivery.\nOn conflicting evidence the learned trial judge has found that the breach of warranty which the appellant pleaded and on which he based his case at the trial has not been established. This finding has been concurred in by the Court of Appeal, and, in my opinion, it should be upheld. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.H. Young.\nSolicitor for the respondent: L.C.

In the immediate locality were then already located three like establishments operated by different competitor companies. The application was rejected by a resolution of the Council of the City, notwithstanding that all the requirements of s. 76 had been fully complied with and that the Building Inspector of the City had transmitted to the Council a favourable certificate. Proceedings were then instituted by way of mandamus to challenge the validity of s. 76 in so far as it purported to give the Council a discretionary power to grant or refuse the permit, to ask that that portion of s. 76 be declared ultra vires the powers of the City as delegated to it under the Cities and Towns Act (R.S.Q. 1941, c. 233), and to compel the granting of the permission. In the Superior Court, the City was successful, but the majority in the Court of Appeal for Quebec declared null and void, as ultra vires, the above mentioned portion of s. 76.\nHeld, dismissing the appeal, that the portion of s. 76 of by-law 128 of the City of Verdun, purporting to give the Council a discretionary power to grant or refuse the permit, was ultra vires the powers of the City as delegated to it by s. 426 of the Cities and Towns Act. The municipalities, deriving their legislative powers from the provincial Legislature, must frame their by-laws strictly within the scope delegated to them; but the City, by enacting s. 76, effectively transformed its delegated authority to regulate by legislation into a mere administrative and discretionary power to grant or cancel by resolution the permit provided for in the by-law. (Phaneuf v. Corp. du Village de St-Hughes (1) and Corp. du Village de Ste-Agathe v. Reid (2) referred to).\nHeld further, that the City, having fought its case on the assumption, sufficiently justified by the record, that the plaintiff had a legal interest in the action, is now bound by the manner in which it conducted its defence and cannot therefore gain a new ground in law. (The Century Indemnity Co. v. Rogers (3) and Sullivan v. McGillis (4) followed). APPEAL from the judgment of the court of King\u2019s Bench, Appeal side, province of Quebec 1, reversing St-Jacques and Barclay JJ.A. dissenting, the decision of the trial judge and holding that part of s. 76 of by-law 128 of the city of Verdun was ultra vires.\nL. J. de la Durantaye K.C. and Maurice Fauteux K.C. for the appellant. The principle laid down in Phaneuf v. Corp. du Village de St-Hughes 2 is undisputed except as to the use of the word \"strictly\". The legislator cannot anticipate every case down to its smallest details. Therefore, in order to be intra vires, a by-law need only to be within the general powers given by the Legislature.\nUnder the terms of Art. 426 of the Cities and Towns Act, if the Council could determine by by-law the locality for a particular industry, it certainly could authorize the Council to do so by resolution. If Art. 426 did not authorize the Council to enact s. 76, then Art. 424 gives the municipality powers general enough to enact it. This authority can also be found under Art. 429(22) of the Cities and Towns Act. The good administration of the City requires such a discretion which, the evidence reveals, was properly exercised. Furthermore, if the Building Inspector, under the terms of Art. 426 of the Act, has a discretion in the granting or refusing of the permit, why not the Council?\nAssuming then that the Council could, in its discretion, grant or refuse the permit, the Courts cannot intervene and substitute their discretion to the Council's: No\u00ebl v. Cit\u00e9 de Quebec 3 and Quinlan v. City of Westmount 4.\nSubsidiarily, even if the City had exceeded its jurisdiction, the respondent could not by way of mandamus ask that the portion of s. 76 be declared null. There is no act or duty incumbent upon the City by-law to grant the permit (Art. 992 C.P.C.). Quite the contrary, s. 76 leaves it to the discretion of the Council. Even if that part of s. 76 is erased, there is still no stipulation of the law to oblige the Council to grant the permit. The mandamus was not the most effectual remedy as required by Art. 992 C.P.C. (Kearns v. Corp. of Low 5 relied on). Furthermore, in order to proceed by mandamus, the respondent needed to have at least an eventual interest which had to exist at the time of the taking of the action. The respondent was not at that time owner nor lessee. (Perron v. Corp. du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur de J\u00e9sus 6, No\u00ebl v. Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec 7, Clegg v. MacDonald 8 and Re Workmen's Compensation Act 9 relied on).\nG. C. Papineau-Couture K.C. and R. C. Harvey for the respondent. A power to grant or refuse at will the permit is ultra vires. So soon as an applicant has established fulfilment of all the requirements of the by-law, the municipality is in duty bound to grant the permit by the provisions of Art. 426 of the Cities and Towns Act. It matters not whether the power to issue permits is given by by-law to a designated officer or to the Council, the principle is the same. Clearly the City must proceed not by resolution but by by-law. It must follow its prescriptions and cannot alter or disregard the same. Otherwise, the Council administers and legislates by simple resolution where the governing statute orders this to be done by by-law and specifically forbids any change or alteration unless a modifying by-law is adopted by the secret vote of the interested proprietors. (Phaneuf v. Corp. du Village de St-Hughes supra). Such an arrogation of discretionary powers was condemned in clear, strong and definite language in Corp. du Village de Ste-Agathe v. Reid supra. The same principle was upheld in Baikie v. City of Montreal 10 and Murray v. District of Burnaby 11.\nThe City has the right to regulate and locate establishments, but this can only be done by a general by-law and not by a so-called discretion under a building by-law. When the conditions of the by-law have been complied with, a mandamus will lie to compel the granting of the permit: Rosenfelt v. Biron 12. The way s. 76 has been interpreted, it opens every door to arbitrariness, discrimination and injustice. The cases of Jaillard v. City of Montreal 13 and Phaneuf supra are also relied on. The respondent's interest in obtaining a permit clearly appears from a perusal of the petition and from the evidence. The appellant never raised the ground up to now of lack of interest. By-law 128, s. 76, does not restrict applications for a permit to any category of individuals. The appellant knew that an option had been obtained on the site and that considerable time and money had been spent in negotiating for the purchase of the property. The interest of the respondent is evidenced by the prejudice caused by the refusal of the permit: Quebec Paving Co. v. Senecal 14; Gingras v. Corp. du Village de Richelieu 15 and Hyde v. Webster 16.\nL. J. de la Durantaye K.C. replied.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux J.\u2014The respondent, hereinafter also called \"the Company\", carries on business throughout Canada and more particularly in the judicial district of Montreal, as vendor and distributor of motor fuels and oils, auto accessories, and as operator of motor vehicle service station, both as owner and lessee thereof.\nTowards the end of December 1949, and pursuant to section 76 of by-law 128 of the by-laws of the appellant, hereinafter also referred to as \"the City\", the Company applied to the latter for permission to erect a service station and sales shop on an emplacement at the intersection of Bannantyne and Fifth Avenues in the city of Verdun. In this immediate locality were then already located three like establishments operated by different competitor companies.\nSection 76 is entitled \"Specially Restricted Buildings\". Briefly, paragraph (a) thereof prescribes that\nAny person wishing to erect or use a building or any premises or to occupy a lot of land for \u2026 gasoline stations \u2026 shall make an application in writing to the City to do so.\nParagraphs (b), (c) and (d), in which the parts more relevant to this issue are underlined, may conveniently be quoted in full:\u2014\n(b) Any person who wishes to obtain such permission shall make an application to that effect to the Building Inspector who shall transmit a copy of such application to the City Clerk. The latter shall give at least ten (10) days public notice of said application by means of an advertisement in at least two local newspapers, one English and one French, in which the City usually publishes its advertisements, the said notice to be also posted by the applicant in a conspicuous place on the lot of land, building or premises proposed to be used for such purpose, so that the neighboring proprietors or residents or other parties interested may have an opportunity of opposing the granting of such a permission. The above mentioned poster shall be supplied by the Building Inspector Department. No such application shall be entertained by the City unless notice thereof be previously given as hereinabove provided nor unless applicant binds himself, in writing, to equip the boilers, engines, motors or furnaces which he proposes to set up with smoke and gas consumers such as will efficiently free the same from smoke and all that may, in their use, be harmful to the public.\n(c) Upon the receipt of any such application the Building Inspector shall inspect the lot of land, building or premises, or examine the plan of the building or premises proposed to be used for any of the purposes set forth in Section 76 of this By-Law and, if satisfied that such building or lot of land meets the requirements of this By-Law and that the permission applied for may be granted without in any way endangering life or property, he shall transmit a certificate to this effect to the City Council, which may, at its discretion, grant or deny the permission applied for.\n(d) Whenever any such application is made to the Building Inspector, the applicant shall deposit at the City Treasurer's Office a sum of ten dollars ($10) to cover the cost of advertisements and other expenses incurred by the City in connection with such application.\nFirst considered on the 14th of February 1950, and again\u2014the Company having protested the first decision\u2014on April 2, 1950, the application of the latter was, on each occasion, rejected by a resolution of the Council of the City. No reason for such refusal was expressed in the resolutions or, then, otherwise conveyed to the Company. It was however conceded, before this Court, by counsel for the appellant, that all the requirements of the section had been fully complied with by the Company and that the Building Inspector of the City had issued and transmitted to the Council a favourable certificate, i.e., a certificate attesting that the requirements of the by-law were met and that the permission applied for could \"be granted without, in any way, endangering life or property.\" The refusal of the Council of the City rested, therefore, solely on the exercise of such discretion as it may have under paragraph (c) to grant or deny the permission applied for. The respondent thereupon instituted proceedings by way of mandamus, challenging the validity of the section insofar as it purports to vest in the Council of the City the right to grant or deny, at its discretion, the permission applied for notwithstanding that, admittedly, all the requirements of the by-law had been met, prayed the Court to declare the same ultra vires the powers of the City as delegated to it under the Cities and Towns Act (R.S.Q. 1941, c. 233), and requested an order for the issue of a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel the granting of the permission.\nBefore the Superior Court, the City successfully contested these proceedings. Briefly it was held that the Court could not declare section 76 ultra vires the City, the evidence, in the premises, failing to reveal any abuse of powers, or unlawful or arbitrary action on behalf of the Council of the City; that the reasons\u2014traffic density and hazards\u2014given in defence by the City for such refusal, were well founded; and that, in the circumstances, the discretion was properly exercised.\nBy a majority judgment (Gagn\u00e9, McDougall and Bertrand JJ.A.), the Court of King's Bench (Appellate Division) 17 declared null and void, as ultra vires, that portion of section 76 of by-law 128, which purports to give a discretion to the Council to grant or deny permission under the said by-law; annulled likewise the two resolutions of the Council refusing to grant a permit to the Company; and ordered the issue of a peremptory writ of mandamus. St-Jacques and Barclay JJ.A., dissented; holding, the former, that the Company had not established its right to the issue of a permit, and the latter, that the Company had not established any right or interest entitling it to bring the action.\nChallenging the judgment of the Court of Appeal, counsel for the appellant rested his case on only two grounds.\nAs to the first: Counsel contented himself with asserting that, under paragraph (c) of the section, the Council had discretion to grant or deny the permission. Of that there can be no doubt. But the real point, successfully pleaded by the Company before the Court of Appeal, is that\u2014and precisely for that reason and to that extent\u2014the section is ultra vires of the City. In this respect, the Judges of the minority in the Court below said nothing, nor did counsel for the appellant, before us, make any attempt, though invited, to challenge the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal. In the appellant's factum, however, this point is dealt with and must, therefore, be considered.\nThat the municipalities derive their legislative powers from the provincial Legislature and must, consequently, frame their by-laws strictly within the scope delegated to them by the Legislature, are undisputed principles. In the very words of Sir Mathias Tellier, the then Chief Justice of the Province of Quebec, in Phaneuf v. Corporation du Village de St-Hughes 18:\nEn mati\u00e8re de l\u00e9gislation, les corporations municipales n'ont de pouvoirs que ceux qui leur out \u00e9t\u00e9 formellement d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s par la L\u00e9gislature; et ces pouvoirs, elles ne peuvent ni les \u00e9tendre, ni les exo\u00e9der.\nIn the present issue, it appears, from the factum of the appellant, that sections 424, 426 and 429 of the Cities and Towns Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 233\u2014admittedly governing the City of Verdun\u2014are the only ones upon which any reliance is placed as authority, delegated by the Legislature to the City, to enact the portion, here in issue, of section 76 of by-law 128. The parts of the sections relied on are:\u2014\n424.\u2014The Council may make by-laws:\n1. To secure the peace, order, good government, health, general welfare and improvement of the municipality, provided such by-laws are not contrary to the laws of Canada, or of this Province, nor inconsistent with any special provision of this Act or of the charter;\n426.\u2014The Council may make by-laws:\n1. To regulate the height of all structures and the materials to be used therein; to prohibit any work not of the prescribed strength and provide for its demolition; to prescribe salubrious conditions and the depth of cellars and basements; to regulate the location within the municipality of industrial and commercial establishments and other buildings intended for special purposes; to divide the municipality into districts or zones of such number, shape and area as may appear suited for the purpose of such regulation and, with respect to each of such districts or zones, to prescribe the architecture, dimensions, symmetry, alignment and use of the structures to be erected, the area of lots, the proportion which may be occupied by and the distance to be left between structures; to compel proprietors to submit the plans of proposed buildings to a designated officer and to obtain a certificate of approval; to prevent or suspend the erection of structures not conforming to such by-laws and to order the demolition, if necessary, of any structure erected contrary to such by-laws, after their coming into force. 429.\u2014The Council may make by-laws:\nSubsection 22. To remove and abate any nuisance, obstruction, or encroachment upon the side-walks, streets, alleys and public grounds, and prevent the encumbering of the same with vehicles or any other things;\nIn the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal, it is stated that section 426 above is the only provision, under the Cities and Towns Act, from which the authority to enact section 76 of the by-law, or a one similar, may be derived. And there is no doubt that amongst the sections quoted above and invoked in the appellant's factum, it is the only one which specially deals with the subject matter of the questioned by-law. It is common ground, it may be added, that, except in the measure in which it purports to have done so under section 76 of by-law 128, the City has not seen fit to adopt any by-law regulating the location, within the municipality, of industrial and commercial establishments, and other buildings intended for special purposes, nor did it, in any manner, attempt to divide the municipality into districts or zones.\nThe mere reading of section 76 is sufficient to conclude that in enacting it, the City did nothing in effect but to leave ultimately to the exclusive discretion of the members of the Council of the City, for the time being in office, what it was authorized by the provincial Legislature, under section 426, to actually regulate by by-law. Thus, section 76 effectively transforms an authority to regulate by legislation into a mere administrative and discretionary power to cancel by resolution a right which, untrammelled in the absence of any by-law, could only, in a proper one, be regulated. This is not what section 426 authorizes. Furthermore, the second paragraph of the latter section prescribes that \"no by-law made under this paragraph 1 may be amended or repealed except by another by-law approved by the vote, by secret ballot, of the majority in number and in value of the electors who are owners of immoveable property situated in each district or zone to which the proposed amendment or repeal applies.\" This provision supports the proposition that, once exercised, the delegated right to regulate, in the matters mentioned in paragraph 1 of section 426, is to be maintained at the legislative level and not to be brought down exclusively within the administrative field, as it was in the present instance. If it was within the power of the City to do what it did, this prohibition, prescribed in the second paragraph of section 426, would be nugatory.\nThe comments of Sir Melbourne Tait, then A.C.J., in Corporation du Village de Ste-Agathe v. Reid 19, quoted by Gagn\u00e9 J.A., and approved by McDougall and Bertrand JJ.A., are to the point. At page 337, the learned jurist, speaking for the Court of Review, said:\nA by-law is passed after certain formalities, and while in force is general in its application; it is published and is known to the ratepayers of the municipality, whereas a resolution may be passed without such publicity. Moreover, the composition of the council changes from time to time, the conditions might be changed from, meeting to meeting, and the council would then have it in its power to permit one person to erect a saw-mill propelled by steam, upon certain conditions, and in a certain locality, and refuse the same rights to others.\n* * *\nThe permission to erect and conditions would thus be subject to the mere whim of the persons who might form the council of any particular meeting \u2026 It (the by-law) opens the door to discrimination and arbitrary, unjust and oppressive interference in particular cases. It is not really a by-law at all, but a declaration that the council may permit the erections referred to in art. 648 upon such conditions as it may think proper to make at any particular meeting. The rights of those who may desire to erect such manufactories or machinery are left uncertain, and it appears to me this so-called by-law is drawn contrary to the elementary principles upon which an ordinance of that kind ought to be made, \u2026 For this reason alone, \u2026 I am of opinion that the judgment should be reversed \u2026\nThese considerations are sufficient to dismiss the first ground raised by the appellant.\nThe second ground, advanced against the judgment of the Court of Appeal, appears in the reasons of the minority Judges 20. Briefly, it was argued before us that, there being no allegation in the declaration nor any evidence on record that it had any kind of property rights within the territory of the City and particularly on the lot of land upon which it proposes to erect a gasoline station, the Company was denuded of the legal interest required under section 77 of the Civil Code of Procedure to bring the action.\nThe section reads:\u2014\nNo person can bring an action at law unless he has an interest therein.\nSuch interest, except where it is otherwise provided, may be merely eventual.\nAs stated in the reasons for judgment of Gagn\u00e9 J.A., with whom McDougall and Bertrand JJ.A., agreed, this ground was never raised by the City at trial or even in its factum before the Court of Appeal, nor was it dealt with in the judgment of the trial Judge, but appeared for the first time in the reasons for judgment of the minority. Indeed, and having disposed of the other points in the case, Mr. Justice Gagn\u00e9 says:\u2014\nDepuis que ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de est \u00e9crit, j'ai re\u00e7u les notes de M. le Juge St-Jacques et M. le Juge Barcley o\u00f9 l'on soul\u00e8ve, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, la question d'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la requ\u00e9rante.\nIt is quite true that, the provisions of section 77 of the Civil Code of Procedure being provisions of public order, the absence of interest to bring an action may be raised at any stage of the proceedings by the parties, or even by the Court proprio motu. The City, however, has fought the case on the manifest assumption that the plaintiff had a legal interest in the action, and the appropriateness of this assumption is further sufficiently justified by the material in the record. Thus, amongst other facts, it appears: that the Company has \"spent considerable time and money in negotiating the purchase\" of the property; that on its application for the permit, it described itself as \"future owner\"; that through counsel, it protested in a lengthy letter to the City the first refusal of its application and thus obtained a reconsideration of it; that the second refusal was followed by the present action. A reasonable inference of all these facts is that the Company had, when it brought its action, a jus ad rem with respect to the land. And there is nothing in the pleadings or on the evidence suggesting that this inference was not common ground between the parties. The City cannot now adopt, before this Court, a different view on the facts to gain a new ground in law; it is bound by the manner in which it conducted its defence. (The Century Indemnity Company v. Rogers 21. Sullivan v. McGillis and others 22).\nI would dismiss the appeal, maintain and re-affirm the conclusions of the formal judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appellate Division); the whole, with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fauteux, Blain & Fauteux.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Campbell, Weldon, McFadden & Rinfret.\n1 Q.R.

The evidence for the prosecution was that Bunyk, an officer of the R.C.M.P., saw the accused, who was already known to him, sitting at a table in a restaurant. Bunyk, who was at the time accompanied by an. informer, one Powell, could not say whether Powell saw the accused or not. Bunyk entered the restaurant alone and sat down beside the accused at whose table one Lowes was also sitting, and thereupon purchased the drug from the accused. Neither Powell nor Lowes was called as a witness. The accused denied that he was the man from whom the purchase was made and testified that he was not present, he also denied any knowledge of any person named Lowes. The proceedings were by way of speedy trial, and the trial judge, although stating that he disbelieved the accused, acquitted him because of the failure of the prosecution to call Lowes or account for his absence. The appeal taken by the Crown was allowed and a conviction entered.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed (Cartwright J., dissenting in part, would have ordered a new trial).\nHeld, that counsel acting for the prosecution has full discretion as to what witnesses should be called for the prosecution and the Court will not interfere with the exercise of that discretion unless it can be shown that the prosecutor has been influenced by some oblique motive (of which there is here no suggestion). This is not to be regarded as lessening the duty of the prosecutor to bring forward evidence of every material fact known to the prosecution whether favourable to the accused or otherwise. The appeal should be dismissed since there was no obligation on the Crown to call either Powell or Lowes at the trial. (Adel Muhammed El Dabbah v. A.G. for Palestine [1944] A.C. 156 applied; Rex v. Seneviratne [1936] 3 All E.R. 36 explained).\n(Rex v. Lemay (100 Can. C.C. 367), a decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in an appeal by the same accused from his previous conviction on the same charge and ordering a new trial, overruled).\nPer Locke J.: Since the Criminal Code is silent, the Criminal Law of England as it existed on the 19th day of November, 1858, governs the matter. If what appears to have been considered as a rule of practice prior to 1858 had become part of the common law of England, the principle applicable was as stated in R. v. Woodhead (1847) 2 C. & K. 520, and R. v. Cassidy (1858) 1 F. & F. 79, and the Crown was under no obligation to call either Powell or Lowes as a witness. (R. v. Sing (1932) 50 B.C.R. 32 and R. v. Hop Lee (1941) 56 B.C.R. 151 referred to).\nHeld also, that since it is not expressed either explicitly or inferentially in s. 1013(4) of the Criminal Code that the Attorney General should personally sign the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal, there is no substance to the objection that the notice was signed by B. as agent for the Attorney General of British Columbia. (Locke J. agreed with Robertson J.A. that the signature by the agent was sufficient since the appeal was substantially and actually in the name of, and for, the Attorney General of British Columbia).\nHeld further, following Beleyea v. The King [1932] S.C.R. 279, that the Court of Appeal had the power to enter a conviction, it appearing that not only did the trial judge not accept or believe the accused's testimony but he believed and accepted the evidence of the R.C.M.P. officer, and that he dismissed the charge only because he considered wrongly that the Crown had to call Lowes or account for his absence. (Cartwright J., dissenting in part, would have ordered a new trial on the ground that it did not appear certain but only probable that the trial judge would have convicted but for his erroneous ruling on the point of law).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1], allowing, O'Halloran J.A. dissenting, the Crown's appeal from the accused's acquittal at trial on a charge of unlawful sale of drugs.\nJ. Stevenson Hall for the appellant. S. 1013(4) of the Criminal Code gives the right of appeal to the Attorney General and the power to appeal cannot be delegated by the Attorney General. Therefore the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal signed by B. as agent for the Attorney General of British Columbia was not proper in farm and in accordance with s. 1013(4) of the Code (Rex v. Gallant [2]and Rex v. Perry [3].\nPowell and Lowes were essential Crown witnesses who were present throughout the major part of the transaction of selling between Lemay and Bunyk, and should, therefore, have been called as witnesses. The appellant relies in this respect upon the dissenting judgment of O'Halloran JA. and the cases therein referred to, and specially to Rex v. Seneviratne [4] and Rex v. Guerin[5]. The Court of Appeal erred in directing a conviction to be entered. If the setting aside of the acquittal is upheld, a new trial should be directed, since it does not appear from the judgment of the trial judge that he was satisfied of facts which proved the accused guilty. He stated that he disbelieved the accused but does not state expressly, nor does it follow by irresistible inference from anything he does say, that he accepted the evidence of Bunyk. He does not say that, but for the rule of law which he applied, he would have found the accused guilty. It is not certain that he would have convicted the accused. (Rex v. Gun Ying[6] and Rex v. Tonelli[7].\nDouglas McKay Brown for the respondent. The narrative had been completely unfolded by Bunyk. The evidence of Lowes was not essential to the unfolding of the narrative and under the circumstances of the evidence, the Crown was not obliged to call him as a witness. There was no duty on the part of the Crown to call Lowes, who was associating with the accused, a known criminal engaged in the drug traffic. From the principles laid down in Rex v. Seneviratne (supra) and Rex v. Hop Lee[8]), it is clear: (a) There is no general obligation on the part of the Crown to call every available witness; (b) Their Lordships refused to lay down any rule to fetter discretion on a matter such as this which is so dependent on the particular circumstances of each case; (c) That, speaking generally, they could not approve of an idea that the prosecution must call witnesses irrespective of consideration of number, and of reliability, or that 'the prosecution ought to discharge the functions both of prosecution and defence; (d) Witnesses essential to the unfolding of the narrative on which the prosecution is' based must be called by the prosecution whether in the result the effect of their testimony is for or against the case for the prosecution. Under the circumstances of the present case, it was not mandatory on the part of the Crown to call Lowes or Powell as a witness. In the case of Adel Muhammed El Dabbah v. A.G. for Palestine [9], it was stated that the prosecutor has a discretion as to what witnesses should be called for the prosecution, and the Court will not interfere with the exercise of that discretion unless, perhaps, it can be shown that the prosecutor has been influenced by some oblique motive. There is no suggestion of such a motive here. The Crown, therefore, exercised that discretion in not calling Powell or Lowes as witnesses.\nThere is a distinction to be made between the Crown's duty of calling witnesses and the question of identification.\nIn view of the decision of this Court in Beleyea v. The King[10], the Court of Appeal had the power to convict the accused. Since the trial judge would have convicted if he had not considered that in law he could not, therefore the Court of Appeal was right in doing what it did.\nS. 1013(4) of the Criminal Code does not say that the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal must be signed personally by the Attorney General. It is sufficient if the appeal is substantially and 'actually taken in the name of the Attorney General. The present case is different from that of Rex v. Gallant (supra) cited by the appellant.\nThe ease of Rex v. Lee Fong Shee[11] is cited to show the clandestine nature of the drug traffic and the difficulty to obtain a conviction.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Taschereau, Kellock, Estey and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.:-The appellant Lemay was charged with having sold 'a drug to Steven Bunyk, on September 21, 1950, at Vancouver contrary to the provisions of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, as amended. Lemay was tried on that charge and acquitted by His Honour Judge Sargent in the County Court Judges' Criminal Court. On an appeal by the Crown to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [12] that acquittal was set aside, a conviction entered, and the case remitted to the trial judge for sentence. Under subsection 2 of section 1023 of the Code as enacted by section 30 of chapter '55 of the Statutes of 1947, Lemay now appeals to this Court alleging that his conviction was erroneous on two grounds (a) the Court of Appeal erred in finding that it was not essential that the Crown call as a witness one Henry Powell, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police informer, and one Art Lowes, both of whom it was alleged were present throughout the major part of the transaction of selling between the appellant and Bunyk; (b) the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal, which was signed \"Douglas McKay Brown, Agent for the Attorney General of British Columbia\", was not proper in form or in accordance with section 1013(4) of the Criminal Code as enacted by section 28 of chapter 11 of the Statutes of 1930. These grounds will be considered in order.\nSteven Bunyk, who is 'a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, testified that he had known Lemay by sight for some time previous to 21st September, 1950, having seen him on about twelve occasions and having seen his picture several times. He described Henry Powell as a coloured boy used by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and paid by them as an informer. Powell had pointed Lemay out to Bunyk on the street, and on September 20, the two of them went to see Lemay in room 10 in a rooming house in Vancouver known as the Beacon Rooms. Failing to find Lemay there, Bunyk, still 'accompanied by Powell, proceeded to depart when he saw Lemay at the head of the stairs leading to the ground floor, whereupon Lemay said to Bunyk : \"I thought you were coming as I saw you pass the cafe several times.\" Nothing else was said upon that occasion.\nOn the next day, September 21 (the date of the alleged offence), Bunyk and Powell walked in a westerly direction, on the south side of Hastings Street, towards the Malina Cafe. The door to the cafe is on the east side of the cafe with a window immediately to the west. Bunyk looked through that window and saw Lemay sitting in a booth on the west side of the cafe. Bunyk could not say that Powell saw the accused. Bunyk entered the cafe and sat down near Lemay in the booth and there the transaction occur-red, which is the basis of the charge. It is not denied that on that 'occasion Bunyk paid three dollars and received the drug but Lemay denied that he was the man from whom the purchase was made and testified that he was not present. Also sitting in the booth was the other man referred to, known to Bunyk as Art Lowes. The accused denies any knowledge of such a person. He denies knowing Bunyk or seeing or speaking to him on September 20 or 21. He admits that he lived in room 10 in the Beacon Rooms for some time prior to September 20 but states he moved from there on that date. While he says he was away from Vancouver during parts of August and September, he admits being in the city on September 20 and 21 and that on some occasions he had taken his meals at the Malina Cafe.\nNeither Powell nor Lowes was called as a witness. For some time prior to September 20, Bunyk was acting as an under cover agent and he stated that Powell came from the United States and that he did not know where he was. Then the following question and answer appear in the record:\u2011\nQ. Do you know of any inquiries which have been made to locate him?\nA. Inquiries were made to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in Seattle but they have failed to locate him.\nAs to Lowes, Bunyk 'testified that he knew him to see him but that he had no idea how Lowes happened to be with Lemay on September 21 and that Lowes had no connection with the case as far as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police was concerned and that Lowes was not an operator for that organization.\nPrior to the hearing before His Honour Judge Sargent, Lemay had been convicted on the same charge by His Honour Judge Boyd, but that conviction was set aside by the Court of Appeal [13], consisting of O'Halloran, J.A., Robertson, J.A., and Sidney Smith, J.A. (dissenting), on the ground that Powell had not been called as a witness. On the Crown's appeal from the acquittal on the new trial, Sidney Smith, J.A., adhered to the view that he had ex-pressed on the prior appeal, while Robertson, J.A., decided that on the second trial it appeared that Powell had not looked through the window. As to Lowes, he considered that 'the fact that that individual was associated with a drug pedlar, as Lemay was found to be, probably convinced the Crown that his evidence would not be reliable. He pointed out that the fact that Lowes was present was made known at the preliminary hearing and, notwithstanding this, counsel for Lemay did not ask that Lowes be subpoenaed or for an 'adjournment to permit him to have him before the Court, and that the Court was not bound to discharge the functions of the defence. O'Halloran J.A. dissented. He retained the view he had held on the prior appeal as to Powell because he considered the explanation of Powell's absence was of a vague and general character. That view was to the effect that there is a rule whereby the Crown was bound to call Powell as a witness essential to the unfolding of the narrative. He also considered that it was difficult to avoid the reflection that if Lowes could have identified Lemay, the Crown would not have failed to call him, particularly since the Crown knew from the first trial that Lemay denied being in the cafe and, there-fore, on the same basis, that the Crown was bound to call him as a witness. He proceeded further to deal with what he described as a fundamental aspect, viz., the trial judge's attitude towards Lemay's testimony. These views of the learned Justice ,of Appeal cannot be accepted since it is plain upon a reading of the reasons of the trial judge that he believed the evidence of Bunyk and certainly he categorically stated that he did not believe the evidence of Lemay. The trial judge had the witnesses before him and it was not necessary that he itemize the reasons which led him to conclude that Lemay's evidence was not to be believed.\nWhile certain decisions in the British Columbia Courts are referred to in the reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal, as well on the first appeal as on the second, all the arguments on behalf of Lemay in connection with the first ground of appeal are garnered from the following statement in the judgment of Lord Roche, speaking on behalf of the Judicial Committee in Seneviratne v. Rex[14]. \"Witnesses essential to the unfolding of the narrative on which the prosecution is based must, of course, be called by the prosecution whether in the result the effect of their testimony is for or against the case for the prosecution.\" Now, in addition to this statement being obiter as Lord Roche clearly stated, it also appears from page 48 of the first report and page 377 of the second, that he was dealing with the case of the maid Alpina (and similar cases) whose good faith was not questioned by the Crown, and pointed out that what she had said was given apparently without previous cross-examination as to other and previous oral statements It was pointed out that this was both undesirable and not permitted by any sections of the Ceylon Law of Evidence Ordinance. Lord Roche continued:\nIt is said that the state of things above described arose because of a supposed obligation on the prosecution to call every available witness on the principle laid down in such a case as Ram Ranjan Roy v. R. ((1914) 1 L.R. 42 Cale., 422: 14 Digest 273, 2816 (ii)) to the effect that all available eye-witnesses should be called by the prosecution even though, as in the case cited, their names were on the list of defence witnesses. Their Lordships do not desire to lay down any rules to fetter discretion on a matter such as this which is so dependent on the particular circumstances of each case. Still less do they desire to discourage the utmost candour and fairness on the part of those conducting prosecutions; but at the same time they cannot, speaking generally, approve of an idea that a prosecution must call witnesses irrespective of considerations of number and of reliability or that a prosecution ought to discharge the functions both of prosecution and defence. If it does so confusion is very apt to result, and never is it more likely to result than if the prosecution calls witnesses and then proceeds almost automatically to discredit them by cross-examination.\nThen follows the statement relied on. In truth Lord Roche was dealing with an entirely different matter, and reading the whole of his reasons it is clear that not only was he not laying down any such rule as that here asserted but one directly contrary to it.\nIt is made abundantly plain from the subsequent decision of the Judicial Committee in Adell Muhammed v. A.G. for Palestine[15], delivered by Lord Thankerton (which was not brought to the attention of the Court of Appeal), that no such rule as has been contended for, and apparently applied by the majority of that Court on the first appeal and by the dissenting judge on the second appeal, has ever been laid down. The earlier cases are referred to in the argument of counsel for the accused in the Palestine case but Seneviratne v. Rex is not mentioned. At pages 167, 168 and 169, Lord Thankerton deals with the contention that the accused had a right to have the witnesses whose names were on the information but who were not called to give evidence for the prosecution, tendered by the Crown for cross-examination by the defence. Their Lordships agreed with the trial judge and the Court of Criminal Appeal in Palestine that there was no obligation on the prosecution to tender these witnesses. However, while the Court of Criminal Appeal had held that that was the strict position in law, they expressed the opinion that the better practice was that the witnesses should be tendered at the close of the case for the prosecution so that the defence might cross-examine them if they wished, and the Court desired to lay down as a rule of practice that in future this practice of tendering witnesses should be generally followed. Their Lordships of the Judicial Committee doubted whether that rule of practice as expressed by the Court of Criminal Appeal sufficiently recognized that the prosecutor has a discretion and that the Court will not interfere with the exercise of that discretion unless perhaps it could be shown that the prosecutor had been influenced by some oblique motive. Lord Thankerton referred to the judgment of Baron Alderson in Reg. v. Woodhead[16], that the prosecutor is not bound to 'call witnesses merely because their names are on the back of the indictment; that they should be in Court but that they were to be called by the party who wanted their evidence. Lord Thankerton also referred to Reg. v. Cassidy[17] where Baron Parke, after consultation with Cresswell J. stated the rule in similar terms. Lord Thankerton does go on to say that it is consistent with the discretion of counsel for the prosecutor, which is thus recognized, that it should be a general practice of prosecuting counsel, if they find no sufficient reason to the contrary, to tender such witnesses for cross-examinaion by the defence, but it remains a matter for the prosecutor's discretion. Reference was also made to an interlocutory remark by Lord Hewart in Rex v. Harris[18] : \"in criminal cases the prosecution is bound to call all the material witnesses before the court, even though they give inconsistent accounts, in order that the whole of the facts may be before the jury.\" Lord Thankerton said that in their Lordships' view, the Chief Justice could not have intended to negative the long-established right of the prosecutor to exercise his discretion to determine who the material witnesses are.\nIn the present case there did not appear on the back of the charge sheet the name of any witness but that fact is unimportant. Powell and Lowes did not give evidence at the preliminary inquiry. There was no obligation on the Crown to call either of them at the trial and we are therefore not concerned with the question whether the explanation of Powell's absence was satisfactory or not. Of course, the Crown must not hold back evidence because it would assist an accused but there is no suggestion that this was done in the present case or, to use the words of Lord Thankerton, \"that the prosecutor had been influenced by some oblique motive.\" It is idle to rely upon such expressions as this or the one used by Lord Roche without relating them to the matters under discussion but the important thing is that unless there are some particular circumstances of the nature envisaged, the prosecutor is free to exercise his discretion to determine who are the material witnesses.\nThe second ground of appeal may be disposed of in a few words. Subsection 4 of section 1013 of the Code enacts:\n(4) Notwithstanding anything in this Act contained, the Attorney General shall have the right to appeal to the court of appeal against any judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court in respect of an indictable offence on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law alone.\nIt is not contended that Mr. Brown was not the agent of the Attorney General of British Columbia or that he did not have the latter's authority to institute the appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal but it is said that at least the Attorney General personally should have signed the notice of appeal. It is sufficient to say that it is not so expressed in the subsection, either explicitly or inferentially, and that there is no substance to the objection.\nIn registering a conviction, the Court of Appeal had the authority of this Court in Belyea v. The King[19]. It was there pointed out that by section 1014 of the Criminal Code, the powers of a Court of Appeal on hearing 'an appeal by a person convicted are, under subsection 3, in the event of the appeal being allowed, to\n(a) quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered, or\n(b) direct 'a new trial; and in either case may make such other order as justice requires.\nThis section is made applicable on an appeal by the Attorney General against an acquittal by the provisions of subsection 5 of section 1013 as enacted by section 28 of chapter 11 of the Statutes of 1930, that mutatis mutandis (1) on the appeal thereby given, the Court shall have the same powers as it has on an appeal by the accused. Chief Justice Anglin pointed out that while it seemed rather a strong thing to hold that the effect of the words mutatis mutandis is that that clause must be made to read \"on an appeal by the Attorney General to\n(a) quash the acquittal and direct a judgment and verdict of conviction to be entered;\"\nyet that apparently was the construction put upon the provision by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario. Chief Justice Anglin continued by stating that while it had occurred to some members of this Court that the correct course would be to apply clause (b) and to direct 'a new trial, the Court was merely affirming the facts found by the trial judge and upon them reached the conclusion that the only course open to the Appellate Division was to allow the appeal and convict the accused.\nUpon reading the reasons for judgment of His Honour Judge Sargent, I am convinced that not only did he not accept or believe the 'appellant's testimony but he believed and accepted the evidence of Bunyk and it was only be-cause he considered himself bound by the previous decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia that he dismissed the charge.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nRAND J.:-I think it clear from the authorities cited that no such absolute duty rests on the prosecution as the Court of Appeal in the earlier proceeding held. Material witnesses in this context are those who can testify to material facts, but obviously that is not identical with being \"essential to the unfolding of the narrative.\" The duty of the prosecutor to see that no unfairness is done the accused is entirely compatible with discretion as to witnesses; the duty of the Court is to see that the balance between these is not improperly disturbed.\nOn the other two points also, I concur, and the appeal must be dismissed. LOCKE J. :The appellant, Paul Lemay, was in the month of September 1950 charged with having, at the City of Vancouver, sold a narcotic drug to one Stephen Bunyk, contrary to the provisions of the Opium and Narcotic Drugs Act, and on that charge, after a preliminary enquiry, was committed for trial by the Deputy Police Magistrate on October 6, 1950.\nAt the preliminary hearing, evidence for the Crown was given by Bunyk, an officer in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, to the effect that he had on September 21, 1950, proceeded to ,a restaurant on Hastings Street in Vancouver, in company with one Powell, and entering the restaurant alone purchased the drug from Lemay in the presence of one Art Lowes.\nThereafter, having elected to take a speedy trial before His Honour Judge Bruce Boyd, a judge of the County Court at Vancouver, he was found guilty and sentenced to a term of imprisonment and a fine. Powell, an informer in the employ of the Mounted Police, who had not entered the restaurant with Bunyk, was not called by the Crown at the trial before the learned County Court Judge, though the fact that he had accompanied Bunyk to the restaurant was mentioned. I would infer from the reasons for judgment delivered upon this appeal that the name of Lowes was not mentioned at the trial and it is clear that he was not called as a witness. The present Appellant appealed to the Court ,of Appeal for British Columbia [20] and that court, by ,a decision of the majority (Sidney Smith J.A. dissenting), set the conviction aside upon the ground that as, apparently, Powell had seen the accused in the restaurant his evidence was material on the question of identification, and that there was an obligation on the prosecution to call him. Adopting an expression used by Lord Roche, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Rex v. Seneviratne[21], that witnesses essential to the \"unfolding of the narrative on which the prosecution is based\" must be called by the prosecution, O'Halloran J.A., with whom Robertson J.A. agreed, said in part:\nIf all material witnesses are not called by the prosecution, the defence is thereby deprived of the opportunity for cross-examination, and to that extent an accused is denied the right of full defence which our courts have long recognized as essential to a fair trial. Lemay appeared for trial again before His Honour Judge R. A. Sargent of the County Court of Vancouver on. February 8, 1951, and was represented by counsel. Bunyk gave evidence that Powell had accompanied him to the restaurant and had not entered and, while not mentioning in his evidence in chief the presence of Lowes, did so in cross-examination, saying that Lowes was sitting in a booth in the restaurant with Lemay when he had purchased the drug. Describing th\u00e9 transaction he said that Lemay had in his hand a fingerstall containing capsules wrapped in silver paper when he (Bunyk) sat down opposite him in the booth and asked if he could get one, whereupon Lemay took .one of the capsules and placed it on the table in front of him and he thereupon paid Lemay $3.00. Some evidence was given at the hearing of efforts made by the Crown to locate Powell and of their failure but, in the view that I take of this matter, it is unnecessary to consider its sufficiency since if the Crown was .under .a legal obligation to call Powell or account for his absence, clearly there was the same obligation in respect of Lowes who saw the whole transaction, and no effort was made to account for the failure to call him.\nIt is of importance to note that while the appellant had known from the date of the preliminary hearing before the Deputy Police Magistrate that Bunyk had, according to his story, been accompanied by Powell to the restaurant and had purchased the drug in the presence of Art Lowes, no request was made at the commencement of the trial before His Honour Judge Sargent or during the course of the trial for a direction that the Crown should either call them or assist the defence in locating them, or for an adjournment so that they could be located. The only evidence of identification was that of Constable Bunyk who, while .a police officer, had been working under cover in Vancouver and who had during a period of weeks before the date of the purchase seen Lemay a number of times. Lemay's defence was simply a complete denial of the whole affair and he swore that he had never seen Bunyk before the latter appeared in the Police Court to give evidence. As to Lowes, he said that while he might know him he did not know him by that name. On the question of credibility, the learned trial judge, in giving judgment, said in part :\nThe accused went into the box and categorically denied any sale of narcotics and the testimony of Bunyk in toto. He further states that he did not know Lowes, at least by name. These denials I do not accept, nor do I believe his testimony.\nThen saying that he did not feel that there was sufficient evidence to make a finding as to whether Powell did or did not see the transaction, that the evidence had shown that Lowes was not connected with Bunyk or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and that no explanation had been given as to why he had not been called or what, if any, attempts had been made to find him, after quoting from the judgment of O'Halloran J.A. as to the obligation of the Crown to call all material witnesses, dismissed the charge against the prisoner.\nThe Attorney-General of the Province of British Columbia appealed to the Court of Appeal[22] under the provisions of subsection 4 of section 1013 of the Criminal Code and that Court, by a decision of the majority (O'Halloran J.A. dissenting) allowed the appeal, set the acquittal aside and directed that a conviction be entered and the case remitted to the trial judge for sentence.\nThe appellant alleges two errors in the judgment appealed from : the first, that the notice of appeal to the 'Court of Appeal which was signed by Douglas Mackay Brown, agent for the Attorney-General of British Columbia, was an insufficient compliance with section 1013(4) of the Code, and the second, in finding that it was not essential to the Crown to call Powell and Lowes as witnesses at the trial.\nAs to the first of these points there was no disagreement in the Court of Appeal and I respectfully agree with Mr. Justice Robertson that the signature by the agent of the Attorney-General was sufficient.\nThe contention of the appellant upon the second point is that, as stated by Mr. Justice O'Halloran, Lowes and Powell were material witnesses on the question of the identification of Lemay and there was an obligation in law upon the Crown to call them. For the Crown it is said that it is for the Crown prosecutor, as the representative of His Majesty, to decide what evidence is to be called for the prosecution and that, subject to something in the nature of bad faith on his part, such as endeavouring to obtain a conviction by suppressing the truth (in which event the trial judge could properly intervene), his decision in the matter may not be interfered with. It is perhaps unnecessary to say that there is no suggestion of any such impropriety on the part of those representing the Crown at the preliminary hearing and the trial of this matter.\nSince the Criminal Code is silent on. the matter, the obligation contended for by the appellant, if it exists, must be part of the common law of British Columbia. The question, or one closely allied to it, has been considered in a number of decisions in England. In R. v. Simmonds[23], where counsel for the Crown declined to call a witness whose name appeared on the back of the Indictment, Hui-lock B. said that, though the prosecution were not bound to call every witness whose name was on the indictment, it was usual to do so and, if it was not done, he as the judge would call the witness so that the prisoner's counsel might have an opportunity to cross-examine him. In a note to this case there is a reference to R. v. Witebread, where on 'a trial for larceny the prosecution omitted to call an apprentice of the prosecutor who had been implicated in the theft and who had been examined at the police office and before the grand jury and whose name was on the back of the indictment. Counsel for the prisoner contended that the witness ought to be called but counsel for the prosecution declined, saying that the prisoner's counsel might himself call him if he chose. Holroyd and Burrough JJ. held that the prosecutor's counsel was not bound to call all the witnesses whose names were on the indictment merely to let the other side cross-examine them. The note further reports, however, that in the case of R. v. John Taylor, tried in the same year, Park J. called all the witnesses whose names appeared on the back of the indictment whom the prosecutor had not called, merely to allow the prisoner's counsel to cross-examine them. In R. v. Beezley[24], Littledale J. said that counsel for the prosecution who had closed his case without calling all of the witnesses whose names were on the indictment should call all of them, in order to give the prisoner's counsel an opportunity of cross-examining them. In R. v. Bodle [25], where the charge was murder and counsel for the Crown declined to call the father of the prisoner whose name was on the back of the indictment, Gaselee J., having conferred with Mr. Baron Vaughan, said that they were both of the opinion that if counsel for the prosecution declined to call a witness whose name is on the back of the indictment it is in the discretion of the judge who tries the case to say whether the witness should be called for the prisoner's counsel to examine him, before the prisoner is called on for his defence. In R. v. Holden[26], the charge was murder. The Crown did not call the daughter of the deceased person who, apparently had been present when the offence was committed, whose name was not on the back of the indictment and who was in court. Patteson J. said that she should be called and that every witness who was present at a transaction of that kind, even if they give different accounts, should be heard by the jury so as to draw their own conclusion as to the real truth of the matter. There had been a postmortem examination of the body of the deceased in the presence of three surgeons but, of these, only two were called to give evidence for the Crown, though the third was in court. Patteson J. said that he was aware that the name of this person was not on the back of the indictment but that as he was in court he would insist on his being examined and said :\nHe is a material witness who was not called on the part of the prosecution and as he is in court I shall call him for the furtherance of justice.\nIn R. v. Bull[27], counsel for the Crown said that there was one witness examined before the grand jury whom, on account of information he had since received, it was not his intention to call as a witness for the prosecution; on counsel for the prisoner objecting that it was unfair not to examine all those whose names were on the back of the bill and Crown counsel saying that his intention was to put the witness into the box, Vaughan J. said that the proper course was to put the witness into the box and that: every witness ought to be examined. In cases of this kind counsel ought not to keep back a witness because his evidence may weaken the case for the prosecution.\nIn R. v. Stroner[28], Pollock C.B. directed the prosecution to call two persons as witnesses for the prosecution whose evidence he considered to be material and whose names were not on the back of the indictment but who were in court as witnesses for the accused. In R. v. Barley[29], where the prosecution did not call two witnesses whose names were on the back of the indictment, Pollock C.B. after consulting with Coleridge J. intimated that the witnesses ought to be called by counsel for the prosecution, whereupon the witnesses were placed in the box and sworn on the part of the Crown and cross-examined on behalf of the prisoner.\nThe practice in the matter appears to have been clarified in 1847 when in R. v. Woodhead[30], where counsel for the Crown, after stating the case for the prosecution, had observed that he did not deem it necessary to call all the witnesses whose names were on the back of the indictment, unless counsel for the prisoner should desire it, Alderson B. said:\nYou are aware, I presume, of the rule which the judges have lately laid down, that a prosecutor is not bound to call witnesses merely because their names are on the back of the indictment. The witnesses, however, should be here, because the prisoner might otherwise be misled; he might, from their names being on the bill, have relied on your bringing them here, and have neglected to bring them himself. You ought, there-fore, to have them in court, but they are to be called by the party who wants their evidence. This is the only sensible rule.\nCounsel for the prisoner then asked whether if he called these persons he would make them his own witnesses, to which Alderson B. replied :\nYes, certainly. That is the proper course, and one which is consistent with other rules of practice. For instance, if they were called by the prosecutor, it might be contended that he ought not to give evidence to shew them unworthy of credit, however falsely the witnesses might have deposed.\nIn R. v. Cassidy[31], where the prosecutor refused to call a witness whose name was on the back of the indictment and counsel for the prisoner contended that \"according to the usual practice\" he ought in fairness to do so, Baron Parke said that while the usual course was for the prosecutor to call the witness and, if he declined to examine, the prisoner might cross-examine him, he thought the practice did not stand upon any very clear or correct principle and was supported only on the authority of single judges on criminal trials, and he should, therefore, follow what he considered the correct principle, that the counsel for the prosecution should call what witnesses he thought proper, and that, by having had certain witnesses examined before the grand jury whose names were on the back of the indictment, he only impliedly undertook to have them in court for the prisoner to examine them as his witnesses; for the prisoner, on seeing the names there, might have abstained from subpoenaing them. He then said that he would follow the course said to have been pursued by Campbell C.J. in a recent case, who ruled that the prosecutor was not bound to call such a witness and that, if the prisoner did so, the witness should be considered as his own. Upon counsel for the prisoner saying that he believed that Creswell J. had acted differently, Parke B. consulted with the latter and then said that Creswell J. had informed him that he had always allowed the prosecutor to take his own course in such circumstances, without compelling him to call the witness if he did not think fit to do so, and that he entirely agreed with what Baron Parke proposed to do.\nThe judgment of Baron Parke in Cassidy's case was delivered in March 1858. Section 11 of the Criminal Code declares that the criminal law of England as it existed on November 19, 1858, in so. far as it has not been repealed by any ordinance or act, still having the force of law, of the colony of British Columbia, or the colony of Vancouver Island, passed before the union of the said colonies, or by this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, and as altered, varied, modified or affected by any such ordinance or Act, shall be the criminal law of the Province of British Columbia. Prior to the enactment of the Code the matter had been dealt with and the same date fixed by a proclamation issued under the public seal of the colony of British Columbia by Governor Douglas on November 19, 1858, and by an Ordinance to assimilate the general application of English Law (30 Viet. o. 70) adopted by the Legislative Council of British Columbia on March 6, 1867. In substantially the same form, the provisions of the Ordinance are continued in the English Law Act, c. 111, R.S.B.C.. 1948, section 2. The matter we are considering has not been dealt with by statute. If, therefore, what appears to have been considered as a rule of practice prior to 1858 had become part of the common law of England, the principle was as stated by Baron Alderson in R. v. Woodhead and Baron Parke in R. v. Cassidy. That these decisions are to be regarded as correctly stating the law of England as it was in 1858 is settled by the decision of the Judicial Committee in Adel Muhammed v. Attorney-General for Palestine[32] . Lord Thankerton, it will be noted, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, said in part:\nWhile their Lordships agree that there was no obligation on the prosecution to tender these witnesses, and, therefore, this contention of the present appellant fails, their Lordships doubt whether the rule of practice as expressed by the Court of Criminal Appeal sufficiently recognizes that the prosecutor has a discretion as to what witnesses should be called for the prosecution, and the court will not interfere with the exercise of that discretion, unless, perhaps, it can be shown that the prosecutor has been influenced by some oblique motive.\nWhile the case was an appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal of Palestine and the conviction had been made under the Criminal Code Ordinance 1936 of that State, it is apparent that the matter had not been dealt with by statute and that the law of Palestine was in this respect the same as that of England.\nIn delivering the judgment in the appeal taken by Lemay to the Court of Appeal from his conviction, O'Halloran J.A. refers to two decisions of the courts of British Columbia in which the matter was considered. In R. v. Sing [33], where the Crown did not call certain witnesses whose names were on the back of the indictment, Macdonald J., referring to R. v. Woodhead and R. v. Cassidy and to a more recent decision in R. v. Wiggins [34], ruled that, unless the Crown saw fit to do so, it was not necessary to call all of the witnesses whose names appeared. Counsel for the prisoner contended that there were two other witnesses called at the preliminary who should be called, in order that he might cross-examine them, but the report of the matter does not indicate that any such order was made. In R. v. Hop Lee[35], where the charge was selling narcotic drugs,\nthe Crown did not call a Chinese witness who was in the employ of the police and who had been a witness to the sale. The accused was convicted and appealed to the Court of Appeal and the report shows that counsel for the Crown there took the attitude that the Crown was under no obligation to call all, the witnesses and that this particular man was a \"stool pigeon\" whose evidence could not be relied upon. The Court unanimously dismissed the appeal and it may be noted that McDonald J.A. (afterwards C.J.B.C.) quoted a length from the judgment of Lord Roche in Rex v. Seneviratne, which has been so much discussed in the present matter, including that passage where it is said that their Lordships could not, speaking generally, approve of an idea that a prosecution must call witnesses irrespective of considerations of number and of reliability, or that a prosecution ought to discharge the functions both of prosecution and defence.\nIn the present matter 'the prisoner, who was tried before His Honour Judge Sargent in February 1951, had known since the previous September that Bunyk would give evidence that he had been accompanied to the restaurant by Powell and that Lowes was sitting in the booth with him when the sale was made to the constable. The proceedings following the committal were, by reason of the election of the appellant, by way of speedy trial and there was thus no indictment upon which the names of the witnesses proposed to be called would be endorsed and there is no suggestion that any step was taken on the part of the prosecution which would lead counsel for the accused to expect that they would be in court when the matter came up for hearing and thus available to give evidence, as was the case in R. v. Woodhead. Powell was an informer in the employ of the police and, even had he been available, counsel for the Crown might well have decided not to call him as a witness for the prosecution, as was done in the case of Hop Lee. As to Lowes, the only information concerning him in the record is that Constable Bunyk on re-examination said that he (Lowes) had no connection with the matter \"as far as the R.C.M.P. is concerned\" and that he was not an operator for the R.C.M.P. From the fact that Lowes was, according to Bunyk, sitting at the table in the restaurant with Lemay when the latter produced the finger-stall containing the small packages of the drug and made the sale to Bunyk, it might be inferred that Lowes was a confederate of the latter, since, otherwise, he would be unlikely to commit a criminal offence in his presence. If this be the proper inference to draw, is it to be said that, as a matter of law, the Crown was required to call Lowes as a witness for the prosecution and thus, assuming he should join with Lemay in denying that any such trans-action had taken place, assist 'a guilty person to escape? From a practical view point, if that was the law, far from furthering the due administration of justice it would, in my opinion, actively retard it. In the case of those engaged in the illicit drug traffic, by working in pairs, the one making the sale would be assured at all times of having a witness with him available, in the case of a prosecution, to join in denying that anything of the kind had taken place and whom the Crown would be bound to call. For the appellant, reliance is placed upon that portion of the judgment of Lord Roche, hereinbefore referred to, where it was said that the witnesses essential to the \"unfolding of the narrative on which the prosecution is based\" must be called. This language must, however, be read together with its context, as was done by McDonald J.A. in Hop Lee's case, and so read it does not, in my opinion, sustain the contention of the appellant. If, indeed, there were any difference between what was said by Lord Roche in that case, which, as the report indicates, was obiter, and what was said by Lord Thankerton in the case of Adel Muhammed (and I think there is not), it is, in my opinion, the latter view that should be accepted.\nThe reasons for judgment delivered by His Honour Judge Sargent satify me that he believed the evidence of the witness Bunyk and that, had he not considered that he was bound to acquit the accused by reason of the failure of the Crown to call Lowes as a witness or account for his absence, he would have found the accused guilty.\nAs to the contention that there was error in the judgment appealed from, in that the appellant was found guilty and the case remitted to the trial judge for sentence, the matter appears to me to be determined against the appellant by the decision of this court in Rex v. Belyea[36]\nI would dismiss this appeal. CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting in part) :-This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [37] dated March 22, 1951, setting aside the judgment of acquittal of a charge of unlawfully selling a drug contrary to the provisions of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act pronounced on the 27th February, 1951, by His Honour Judge Sargent, ordering a conviction to be entered and remitting the case to the trial judge to impose sentence.\nThe respondent was first tried for the said offence before His Honour Judge Boyd and was convicted on November 2, 19'50. On December 22, 1950, this conviction was set aside by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[38] (O'Halloran, Robertson and Sidney Smith, JJ.A.) the last named learned Justice of Appeal dissenting, and a new trial was directed.\nThe evidence mainly relied on by the Crown at the trial with which we are concerned, before His Honour Judge Sargent, was that of Constable Bunyk of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who testified in chief that on the 21st of September, 1950, at about 9.15 a.m. accompanied by one Powell he approached the Malina 'Caf\u00e9 in Vancouver; that he looked through the window and saw the appellant, who was already known to him, seated at a table in about the fifth booth on the west side of the caf\u00e9; that he can not tell whether Powell also looked through the window or saw the appellant; that he (Bunyk) entered the caf\u00e9 alone and sat down beside the appellant; that the appellant had in his hand a grey finger-stall containing several capsules wrapped in silver paper and was trying to remove an elastic band from around the top of the finger-stall; that he said to the appellant-\"Can I get one?\" and the appellant replied \"Yes\"; that the appellant took one of the capsules from the finger-stall and placed it on the table in front of Bunyk; that he (Bunyk) picked it up and put it in his pocket and handed the appellant three dollars; that he left the caf\u00e9 and rejoined Powell about two doors east of the caf\u00e9. In cross-examination and re-examination Bunyk testified that throughout the trans-action which he had described in chief one Art Lowes was sitting in the booth with the appellant and that Lowes was known to him (Bunyk). The following questions and answers are found in the re-examination:\nQ. How did Lowes happen to be with LeMay at the time of this transaction?\nA. I have no idea.\nQ. Did the Art Lowes who was with LeMay at the time of the transaction have any connection with this case as far as the R.C.M.P. is concerned?\nA. None whatever.\nQ. Is Lowes an operator for the R.C.M.P.?\nA. No, he is not.\nThe Crown proved that the capsule purchased by Bunyk contained the drug mentioned in the charge.\nThe appellant gave evidence. He denied having had anything to do with the matter; stated that he had never seen Bunyk prior to the preliminary hearing; that he did not use drugs and that he had never sold ,a drug to Bunyk or to anyone else. The learned trial judge reserved judgment and later dismissed the charge.\nIn examining the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge it is necessary to know something of the earlier trial of the appellant ,and of the reasons which moved the Court of Appeal to set aside that conviction and direct a new trial.\nThe only substantial differences between the evidence given at the first trial and that given at the second which were suggested to be relevant to the determination of this appeal appear to be: (i) At the first trial the evidence in the view of the Court of Appeal indicated that Powell was in a position to see what occurred in the caf\u00e9 at the time Bunyk purchased the drug, while the effect of the evidence in this regard at the second trial is summarized by the learned trial judge as follows:\nI do not feel that there is sufficient evidence before me upon which to make any finding, either that Powell did or did not see the transaction between the accused and Bunyk.\n(ii) At the first trial no evidence was given to shew why counsel for the Crown did not call Powell as a witness, while at the second trial evidence was received to the effect that he had disappeared and that inquiries as to his whereabouts were unproductive of result. (It should be mentioned that Mr. Hall argued that the evidence as to the making of these inquiries was inadmissible on the ground that it was hearsay, but as, in my view, this evidence has no bearing on the result of the appeal I do not deal with this question.) (iii) At the first trial there was no evidence of the presence of Art Lowes at the time of the sale, indeed, Lowes was not mentioned at all.\nThe reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal on the appeal from the conviction at the first trial are set out in full in the reasons of O'Halloran J.A. in the present case and are reported as LeMay (No. 1) in 100 C.C.C. pages 367 and 368. The question whether that judgment was right in the result is not before us and I express no opinion. That appeal was brought by the accused and under section 1014(c) of the Criminal Code it was the duty of the Court of Appeal to allow the appeal if of opinion that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice.\nThe learned judge presiding at the second trial appears to me to have interpreted the reasons of the Court of Appeal in LeMay (No. 1) as laying down as a rule of law that the unexplained omission on the part of the Crown to call a witness shewn by the evidence to have been in a position to give relevant and material evidence as to the guilt or innocence of the accused necessitates an acquittal. The learned trial judge appears to have inclined to the view that the failure to call Powell was sufficiently explained. He then proceeds:\nHowever, there is one other piece of evidence which came out in cross-examination, namely, that a ,third person, Lowes was present at the sale to Bunyk. Evidence was led by the Crown to show that Lowes was not connected with Bunyk or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, but no explanation was given as to why he had not been called, or what, if any, attempts were made to find him.\nOn these facts I am faced with the principle laid down by the Court of Appeal in Rex v. Lemay. In that case, Mr. Justice O'Halloran said in the course of his judgment:\nIf all material witnesses are not called by the prosecution, the defence is thereby deprived of the opportunity for cross-examination, and to that extent an accused is denied the right of full defence which our Courts have long recognized as essential to a fair trial.\nThe judgment is binding on me in. this case. Therefore, the motion to dismiss will be allowed and the charge dismissed.\nThe right of appeal against a judgment of acquittal is given to the Attorney-General by section 1013(4) and is, of course, restricted to grounds of appeal which involve a question of law alone. In my respectful opinion the learned trial judge erred in law in instructing himself that there is a rule of law such as he deduced from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in LeMay (No. 1) viz: that the unexplained omis\nsion on the part of the Crown to call a witness shewn by the evidence to have been in a position to give relevant and material evidence as to the guilt or innocence of the accused necessitates an acquittal.\nI do not propose to examine the authorities at length. I think it sufficient to refer to the judgment of their Lordships of the Judicial Committee delivered by Lord Thankerton in Adel Muhammed El Dabbah v. Attorney-General for Palestine[39] and particularly at pages 167 to 169, where it is laid down that the Court will not interfere with the exercise of the discretion of the prosecutor as to what witnesses should be called for the prosecution unless, perhaps, it can be shewn that the prosecutor has been influenced by some oblique motive. I find no conflict between this judgment and that pronounced by Lord Roche, also speaking for the Judicial Committee in Rex v. Seneviratne[40]). Counsel for the appellant laid emphasis on the following passage at page 378:\nWitnesses essential to the unfolding of the narrative on which the prosecution is based must, of course, be called by the prosecution, whether in the result the effect of their testimony is for or against the case for the prosecution.\nIt must be remembered that Rex v. Seneviratne was a ease in which the accused had been convicted of murder on purely circumstantial evidence. In the passage just quoted it appears to me that Lord Roche Was referring to the duty which clearly rests upon the prosecutor to place before the Court evidence of every material circumstance known to the prosecution including, of course, those circumstances which are favourable to the accused. It must also be remembered that Lord Roche was not dealing with an argument of counsel for the accused that the prosecutor had failed to call witnesses that he should have called, but with the reply of counsel for the Crown to the argument of counsel for the defence that the prosecutor had called a number of witnesses who gave irrelevant and inadmissible evidence and whose evidence ought not to have been received.\n[Page 257].\nI wish to make it perfectly clear that I do not intend to say anything which might be regarded as lessening the duty which rests upon counsel for the Crown to bring for-ward evidence of every material fact known to the prosecution whether favourable to the accused or otherwise; nor do I intend to suggest that there may not be cases in which the failure of the prosecutor to call a witness will cause the tribunal of fact to come to the conclusion that it would be unsafe to convict. The principle stated by Avory J. in Rex v. Harris[41]), that in a criminal trial where the liberty of a subject is at stake, the sole object of the proceedings is to make certain that justice should be done between the subject and the State, is firmly established.\nWhile it is the right of the prosecutor to exercise his discretion to determine who the material witnesses are, the failure on his part to place the whole of the story as known to the prosecution before the tribunal of fact may well be ground for quashing a conviction. Such a case is that of Edward Guerin [42]).\nFor the above reasons I am of opinion that the learned trial judge erred in directing himself that he was bound as a matter of law to acquit the appellant because of the fact that the Crown did not call Art Lowes as a witness; and that the Court of Appeal were right in deciding that the judgment of acquittal should be set aside.\nAs to the second ground of appeal argued before us-that the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal was not in accordance with section 101'3(4) of the Criminal Code-I agree with what has been said by my brother Kerwin.\nIt remains to consider Mr. Hall's final argument that the Court of Appeal erred in directing a conviction to be entered ,and that if the setting aside of the acquittal is upheld a new trial should be directed.\nWe are bound by the judgment of this Court in Rex v. Belyea [43], which decided that the wording of section 1013(5) of the Criminal Code is apt to confer jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal in an appeal brought by the Attorney-General under section 1013(4) not only to set aside the judgment of acquittal and to direct a new trial but, in a proper case, to direct a conviction to be entered, and it is irrelevant to inquire whether, if the matter were res integra I would have found the wording of the section sufficiently plain and unambiguous to effect so revolutionary a change in the pre-existing law.\nIn my opinion the power to direct that a conviction be entered after an acquittal by 'a trial judge has been set aside can be exercised only if it appears to the Court of Appeal from the judgment of the trial judge that he must have been satisfied of facts which proved the accused guilty of the offence charged. In the case at bar I do not think that this appears. It is quite true that the learned trial judge says:\nThe accused went into the box and categorically denied any sale of narcotics, and the testimony of Bunyk in tote. He further states that he , did not know Lowes, at least by name. These denials I do not accept, nor do I believe his testimony.\nbut he nowhere states expressly, nor does it follow by irresistible inference from anything he does say, that he accepts the evidence of Bunyk. He does not say that, but for the supposed rule of law which he applied, he would have found the accused guilty. He does not indicate that he is left without any reasonable doubt as to his guilt. In the view he took of the law, it was, indeed, no more necessary for the learned trial judge to express himself upon any of these vital matters than it would have been fora jury to da so after being directed that in view of a point of law taken by the defence they must return a verdict of \"not guilty\". It is not, I think, sufficient that, from the reasons of the learned trial judge, it should appear to the Court of Appeal in the highest degree probable that he would have convicted but for his erroneous ruling on the point of law; it must appear certain that he would have done so.\nI would allow the appeal to the extent of setting aside that part of the order of the Court of Appeal which directs a conviction to be entered and would order a new trial.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.

Jardine, deceased Respondent.\n1951: May 28, 29; 1951: October 10.\nPRESENT:\u2014Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand, Kellock and Cartwright JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.\nWill\u2014Admitted to probate in solemn form\u2014Power of Supreme Court of PM1. in banco to order new trial\u2014The Probate Act, 1939, c. 41 and amendments, ss. 37, 42, 43\u2014The Judicature Act, 1940, c. 35 and amendments, s. 26(1), O. 68 rules 1, 4 and 5.\nThe Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island sitting in banco, set aside the judgment of Palmer J. of the Court of Probate whereby he admitted to probate in solemn form the will and codicil of the late William Faulkner Jardine, and ordered a new trial before the Probate Court. An appeal was taken from that part of the judgment directing a new trial. As to that part which set aside the judgment of the Probate Court, the appellant contended that the Appeal Court having found the documents submitted not proved, and no other document of a testamentary nature having been offered for probate, this was a finding of intestacy and the Appeal Court had no power to direct a new trial and further, since the evidence clearly established testamentary incapacity, a direction for a new trial was unnecessary.\nHeld: By the majority of the Court, Rand J. expressing no opinion and Cartwright J. accepting the reasons of Kerwin J. (concurred in by Taschereau J.) and of Kellock J., the Supreme Court in banco had power to direct a new trial.\nHeld: also, Rand and Cartwright JJ. dissenting, that in the circumstances of the case, a new trial should be had.\nRand J. would have allowed the appeal and pronounced against both the will and codicil. Cartwright J. would have dismissed the appeal, allowed the cross-appeal and restored the judgment of the trial judge.\nPer Kerwin and Taschereau JJ.\u2014Section 43 of The Probate Act stating that if the appeal is allowed the Court of Appeal shall make such order as shall seem fit is sufficient for that purpose. If there be any doubt then\nPer Kerwin, Taschereau and Kellock JJ.\u2014Such authority is to be found in The Judicature Act, 1940, c. 35, s. 26(1); 0.58 r. 5 passed thereunder, and 1941, c. 16, s. 2.\nPer Kerwin and Taschereau JJ.\u2014Without deciding whether such evidence would be admissible or not, on the new trial to be had, no one appearing as counsel for any party should give evidence. Per Cartwright J.:\u2014While the earlier English and Canadian cases decided that the fact of counsel acting as a witness on behalf of his client was in itself a ground for ordering a new trial, such evidence is now legally admissible in Canada, but agreement is expressed with he statement of Ritchie C.J. in Bank of British North America v. McElroy, 15 N.B.R. 462 at 463 that the tendering of such evidence \"is an indecent proceeding and should be discouraged\".\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island in Banco ([1]) setting aside the Judge of Probate's judgment admitting to probate in solemn form the last will and codicil of the late William Faulkner Jardine, and ordering a new trial in proof of the said documents per testes or in solemn form to be held before the Probate Court.\nK. M. Martin, K.C., for the appellants. This appeal is taken from that part of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island en banc which directs a new trial and not from that part of the judgment which sets aside the judgment of the Probate Court. The appellants contend as to the latter that the Court found that the documents which the Probate Court declared were proved before it as the last will and codicil of a competent testator had not been so proved, and as no other document of a testamentary nature was offered for probate the judgment is a finding that the decedent died intestate and therefore no new trial could be directed. Under the law of Prince Edward Island and under the rules and practice relating to appeals to the Supreme Court thereof from a judgment or decree of the Probate Court allowing an instrument of a testamentary nature alleged to have been executed by a decedent, the Supreme Court after setting aside the Probate Court's judgment has no power to direct a new trial before the latter with respect to the same matter or question which the Probate Court had already decided; and (subject to any appeal that might be taken from the Supreme Court's judgment setting aside that of the Probate Court) the Supreme Court's judgment setting aside the Probate Court's judgment allowing the documents, is final. The evidence before the Court clearly established incompetence and testamentary incapacity and a direction for a new trial of proof in solemn form was unnecessary. The respondent's application in the Probate Court and the proceedings taken to prove in solemn form or per testes were proceedings in rem and not inter partes. After pronouncement of the Probate Court in such proceedings there is not and never has been any provision in the practice of the Probate Court of P.E.I. for a new trial of the matters dealt with in such application.\nThe judge of Probate having issued a citation to all persons interested to show cause, having heard the evidence and found for the alleged will, his judgment thereupon became res judicata and final and conclusive with respect to the said application, except the right of appeal therefrom, and no further or other trial of the issues upon which the judgment was pronounced could afterward be directed either by the Probate Court itself or by the Court of Appeal. The Probate Court of P.E.I. has been the only court in which wills have been proved and filed since the Island was made a separate colony in 1769. It was and is entirely independent of the Supreme Court with a practice and procedure all its own. By c. 21 of the Acts of 1873 the Supreme Court of the Province became the Court of Appeal from the Probate Court and the practice and procedure in such appeal was therein set out. In 1939 the acts relating to the Surrogate and Probate Court were repealed by the present Act, c. 41, which Act with its amendments, and which Act alone regulates and governs appeals from the Probate Court to the Supreme Court.\nThe Act regulating the Supreme Court practice is The Judicature Act, 4 Geo. VI c. 35, 1940, and amendments thereto and the Rules of Court made thereunder. Neither the Act nor the rules enacted under its provisions purport to affect the practice with respect to appeals from the Probate Court, nor with the power of the Supreme Court on such appeals; all of which are matters dealt with and regulated by The Probate Act alone. Neither does The Probate Act adopt any of the provisions of The Judicature Act other than that by s. 37 it adopts the Supreme Court practice with regard to the manner of giving Notice of Motion when an appeal is taken. No where is the right given to the Court of Appeal to direct a new trial, except where that Court has directed an issue for the trial of a question arising upon the appeal. No such question arises here. No issue was directed. No claim can therefore be made that the power of granting new trials given by s. 42 of The Probate Act was or could be exercised here. The questions arising under this appeal are the questions which were the issues which the Probate Judge decided and which upon such appeal the Supreme Court was called upon to decide and cannot for that reason be referred to some other court for decision. The power which the Supreme Court purported to exercise in making an order directing a new trial was a power which neither The Probate Act nor any other Act had given the Supreme Court, nor did it have any inherent power, it therefore acted without jurisdiction.\nThe right of appeal to the Supreme Court from the Probate Court, first granted in 1873 was a statutory right, and the powers given the Supreme Court re such appeals were statutory, to be found only in the Act regulating the practice and procedure of the Probate Court. Such a proceeding as a new trial by the Probate Court in a proceeding taken in that Court to prove a will In solemn form was unknown and although appeals have been taken from the Probate Court decisions many times, not once has a new trial been previously ordered.\nThe respondent's application in the Probate Court and the proceedings taken to prove in solemn form documents alleged to be the last will and codicil were proceedings in rem, not inter partes: after pronouncement of the Probate Court in such proceedings, there is not, and never has been any provision in the practice of the Probate Court for a new trial of the matters dealt with.\nThe difference between an action in rem and an action in personam or inter partes is material and has been emphasized in admiralty actions. The Cella (1888) P.D. 82 at 87; The Longford (1889) 14 P.D. 34 at 37; The Burns [1907] P. 137 at 149.\nThe authorities show that proceedings which are, or are equivalent to, proceedings in rem, as in this case, are regulated by rules of procedure differing materially from those of the Common Law courts with respect to actions inter partes, and that the Court appealed from erred when it directed such latter procedure to apply to the Probate Court in its direction for a new trial. In England it is neither the practice of the Admiralty Court nor the Court of Chancery to allow a new trial. The Constitution (1864) 2 Moo P.C. N.S. 453 at 461; Dollman v. Jones (1879) 12 C.D. 553 at 555.\nThe Court of Chancery had power to direct issues, as under s. 42 of the P.E.I. Probate Act the Court of Appeal might have done, but the Court directed no issue. The order made was that the judge of the Probate Court should try over again issues he had already decided, a direction not in accordance with the practice and beyond the powers of the Supreme Court.\nBesides the objections taken to the direction for a new trial on the ground of lack of jurisdiction and upon the ground that the order made directed a mode of procedure unknown to the Probate Court in the proving of wills, the Appellants say that the Supreme Court had before it uncontradicted evidence of an incontrovertible nature which proved conclusively the testator's lack of testamentary capacity; that it was the duty of the Court to evaluate and pass upon such evidence and the law applicable thereto, and that the evidence was such, had it been given effect to, as would have resulted in the will and codicil being disallowed. It was incumbent upon the respondent when the evidence in the Probate Court showed the testamentary capacity was open to grave question, to adduce evidence to show the testator knew and understood the extent of the property of which he was disposing and the claims to which he ought to give effect. The respondent failed to do so. There was a still graver defect, not touched upon at all, except by way of inference by the Court of Appeal and that was evidence of the deceased's incapacity by reason of his lacking the moral sense, the sense of moral obligation and of moral responsibility, the lack of which disqualified the testator and rendered him incapable of making a will. Banks v. Goodfellow (1870) L. R. 5 Q.B. 549 at 563 per Cockburn C.J. at 563.\nCartwright J. \"This might apply to the codicil but how would it apply to the will where he makes provision for the granddaughter?\"\nThere were circumstances of suspicion inviting inquiry as both Courts below admit. It was the duty of the proponent of the will and codicil to adduce evidence to remove such suspicion. Leger v. Poirier [1944] S.C.R. 152; Fulton v. Andrew L.R. 7 H.L. 448; Tyrell v. Painton [1894] P. 151. This finding of suspicious circumstances by the Court of Appeal, should have been the finding of the trial judge whose judgment it set aside. The appellants submit that the respondent having failed to discharge the onus probandi, this Court should declare the documents referred to not well proven and that the deceased died intestate.\nJ. A. Bentley K.C. and Malcolm McKinnon K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the Appeal Court cannot be divided into separate parts and that part, which directs that the pronouncement for the Will and Codicil be set aside, cannot be regarded as a judgment in itself without the order for a new trial. The Appeal Court did not set aside the will and codicil but left them for further proof per testes and in solemn form before the Judge of Probate by a new trial and that was the only finding it made. The Judicature Act and the Rules of Court made thereunder govern all appeals to the Appeal Court including appeals from the Probate Court, and the Appeal Court acted within its jurisdiction in the present case.\nThe Judicature Act, 1929, and rules of Court made in pursuance thereof, were consolidated and revised in 1940 by c. 35 and came into force on Jan. 2, and Feb. 3, 1941 respectively. Section 37 of The Probate Act (1939) allows appeals from the Probate Court regulated by The Judicature Act, 1929 and Rules of the Supreme Court. These rules, including the rule to grant a new trial (0.58 r. 5), were confirmed in 1941 after the passing of The Probate Act (1939) and sub-sec. (f) added to sub-sec. 1 of s. 26 of The Judicature Act expressly made the Supreme Court Rules apply to appeals from the Probate Court. Whether or not no new trial has ever before been directed in such a case as the present one, the Appeal Court has had the power to so direct since 1939 and acted under s. 37 of The Probate Act and in the manner prescribed by 0.58 r. 5 of The Judicature Act relating to appeals. The Respondent asks that the appellants' appeal be dismissed with costs of this Court and of the Court of Appeal below.\nOn the cross-appeal the respondent objected to the Court of Appeal ordering a new trial and submitted that the respondent having proved the capacity of the testator and the due execution of the will and codicil to the satisfaction of the judge of Probate was under no further onus, and that the learned Chief Justice had misconstrued the trial judge's pronouncement as to the preponderance of evidence of capacity. The learned Chief Justice had quoted Viscount Dunedin in Robins v. National Trust [1927] A.C. 519, but respondent submitted there was no even balance in the instant case and the Probate judge had held the onus was fully met by the propounders of the will so that the ruling of Viscount Dunedin at 520 was squarely in favour of no interference with the pronouncement of the trial judge. Colonial Securities Trust Ltd. v. Massey [1896] 1 Q.B. 38 Re Uz King (1931) 3 M.P.R. 367 at 371. The appellants failed to meet the onus resting on them of proving undue influence. Badenach v. Inglis 29 O.L.R. 168 per Riddle J. at 192; Craig v. Lamoureux, 50 D.L.R. 10 at 14; Riach v. Ferris [1934] S.C.R. 725; [1935] 1 D.L.R. 118.\nThe respondent did not dispute the authority of the Court to order a new trial but submitted that there was no evidence of incapacity sufficient to warrant such an order. Faulkner v. Faulkner 60 S.C.R. 386, followed in Manges v. Mills 64 D.L.R. 1; Re McGuire [1935] 3 D.L.R. 734.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Taschereau, JJ. was delivered by:\nKerwin J.:\u2014This is an appeal against a judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island in banco ([2]) setting aside the judgment or pronouncement of the Judge of Probate which had declared that two certain documents were the last will and codicil thereto, respectively, of a competent testator, the late William F. Jardine, and ordering a new trial in proof of the said documents per testes or in solemn form be held before the Probate Court. The appellants are two of the heiresses at law and next of kin of the deceased, and the respondent is the executor of the said will and codicil.\nWilliam F. Jardine died January 2, 1949, and on January 5 of that year the appellants filed a caveat in the Probate Court requiring proof of the will to be made before the Court per testes or in solemn form of law. On the same day the respondent filed a petition in pursuance of which a citation was issued citing all the heirs and next of kin of the deceased and all persons interested in the estate to appear before the judge of the Probate Court on February 17, 1949, to show cause, if any they could, why the said will and codicil should not be proved testes and in solemn form and why probate should not be granted. The trial took place at a subsequent date when the only appearances were on behalf of the executor and the present appellants. This procedure was adopted under s. 50 of The Probate Act, c. 41 of the Prince Edward Island Statutes of 1939, and a 50a, added thereto by c. 15 of the Statutes of 1942. Since there was no allegation of undue influence or fraud, under Probate Rule 10 the respondent as the propounder of the will proceeded and was in the position of a plaintiff in a civil action and the caveator was in the position of a defendant.\nIt was in pursuance of s. 37 of The Probate Act that the respondent appealed \"to the Court of Appeal by Notice of Motion in the manner prescribed by The Judicature Act, 1929, and Rules of the Supreme Court\". By s. 2(c) the \"Court of Appeal\" means the Supreme Court sitting in banco. S. 43 provides in part as follows:\n43. If the appeal is allowed, the Court of Appeal shall make such order, touching the same, and the costs thereto, as, under the circumstances of the case, shall seem fit; ...\nThe appellants contend that the Supreme Court in banco could dismiss the appeal, or could allow the appeal and declare that it had not been proved that the documents were the last will and codicil of a competent testator, but that it could not order a new trial. For the respondent it is argued that s. 43 of The Probate Act quoted above, either by itself or when taken in conjunction with certain provisions of The Judicature Act and the rules passed thereunder clearly establish such right. In my view both of the respondent's contentions are correct. S. 43 of The Probate Act in stating that if the appeal is allowed the Court of Appeal shall make such order as shall seem fit is sufficient for that purpose. If there should be any doubt on that score, then the power is conferred under The Judicature Act and Rules.\nThe present Judicature Act is c. 35 of the 1940 Statutes, which with the exception of s. 11, was proclaimed as coming into force on January 2, 1941. The Rules of Court made in pursuance of s. 26 of that Act came into force on February 3, 1941. By s. 3 of The Judicature Act, the Supreme Court of Judicature of Prince Edward Island as constituted before the Act a Court * * * possessing original and appellate jurisdiction is to continue. By s. 10, the jurisdiction of the Court includes the jurisdiction which immediately preceding the coming in force of the Act was vested in, or capable of being exercised by all or any one or more of the judges of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island. By s. 29:\n29. In all cases of appeal to the Court from the decision, judgment, order or decree of any Court or tribunal in the Province over which the Court has appellate jurisdiction, the appellant may proceed by notice of motion pursuant to the provisions of \"The Rules of the Supreme Court\" respecting appeals; * * *\nBy s. 2 of c. 16 of the Statutes of 1941, it was provided:\n2. The Rules of Court made and published under Section 26 of the Judicature Act are hereby confirmed, and, insofar as any of the said Rules of Court purport to deal with substantive law, the same are hereby ratified and confirmed and declared to be within the jurisdiction of the Judges and Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, as mentioned in said Section 26 of the Judicature Act.\nBy virtue of this section, even if the rules had not been confined to what was authorized under s. 26 of the Act as amended in 1941 and had dealt with substantive law, such rules were ratified and confirmed. Under rule 1 of order 58, all appeals to the Supreme Court shall be by way of rehearing and under rule 4 the Court has power inter alia to make such further or other order as the case requires. Rule 5 provides:\n5. If upon the hearing of an appeal it shall appear to the Court that a new trial ought to be had, it shall be lawful for the said Court, if it thinks fit, to order that the verdict and Judgment be set aside and a new trial shall be had.\nWhile on an appeal, strictly so called such a judgment can only be given as ought to have been given at the original hearing per Jessel M.R. in Quilter v. Mapleson ([3]), wider and more extensive powers are conferred when an appeal is by way of rehearing. Under rule 1 of order 58 appeals to the Supreme Court are by way of rehearing. When one adds to this the power conferred by rule 5 of order 58, it appears to me that the Supreme Court in banco had the jurisdiction and power to order a new trial in the present case as an appeal from the Probate Court is included in the expression \"all appeals\" in rule 1 of order 58. The appellants attempted to draw an analogy with proceedings in the Court of Chancery and referred to the statement of Lord Justice James in Dollman v. Jones ([4]). \"In the Court of Chancery there was no such thing as a motion for a new trial * * * I should be sorry to establish a rule which would make every case in the Chancery Division subject to a motion for a new trial.\" This was said at a time when rule 1 of Order 34 of the English Rules referred to actions in the Queen's Bench, Common Pleas or Exchequer Divisions. This is quite apparent from the decision in Krehl v. Burrell ([5]), upon which the subsequent decision in Dollman v. Jones was based. The rules in England have been amended several times since then and in reading the older cases the distinction must be borne in mind between appeals and motions for a new trial, which latter were to be made to a Divisional Court.\nSimilarly the decisions under the Admiralty practice must be read in the light of the jurisdiction and procedure provided for at the time. The decision of the Privy Council in \"The Constitution\" ([6]), was given before The Judicature Act was enacted. In \"The Fred\" ([7]), Sir Francis Jeune was apparently of the view that the High Court had power to grant a new trial if it appeared that the parties never had a clear decision of the trial judge.\nWe were told that no record could be found of any case in the Island where a new trial had been ordered on an appeal from the decision of the Probate Court allowing, or rejecting an alleged testamentary document but in Riding v. Hawkins ([8]), the Court of Appeal granted a new trial on the ground of surprise at the trial of a probate suit to establish a will and codicil.\nCircumstances must arise from time to time as in my opinion they did in this case, where the proper disposition of an appeal is to order a new trial. Since in my view this appeal should be dismissed, I do not propose to go over the evidence or what occurred at the trial. I am content to agree with the Chief Justice of the Island that for the reasons given: by him a new trial should be had. I would add only that, without deciding whether such evidence would be admissible or not, on such new trial no one appearing as counsel for any party should give evidence. The appeal and the cross-appeal should be dismissed but under the circumstances without costs.\nRAND J. (dissenting):\u2014In the presence of uncontradicted evidence which, in my opinion, raised a grave suspicion of the competency of the testator, there rested upon the proponents the onus of satisfying the conscience of the Court that the documents were those of a man capable of appreciating the nature and extent of his property, not in piecemeal as in a dissociated mind but substantially in its entirety and of appreciating in the same manner those nearest him whose claims to his bounty, as it is described, are normally influential upon men. This I think they did not do and I would allow the appeal and pronounce against both the will and codicil. As the matter is to go to a new trial, however, I refrain from any examination of the facts.\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014The first and main contention of the appellants is that the court below, in directing a new trial, was without jurisdiction so to do, and that that part of the order, from which alone appeal is taken, must be deleted, with the effect of declaring that the testator died intestate.\nIt is not necessary to consider whether there is to be found within the four corners of The Probate Act itself any provision conferring such power upon the Supreme Court. S. 26(1) of The Judicature Act, c. 35 of the Statutes of 1940, authorizes the making of rules not inconsistent with the Act,\n(b) For regulating the pleading, practice and procedure in the Court;\n(c) Generally for regulating the conduct of the business coming within the cognizance of the Court for which provision is not expressly made by this Act.\nSubsequently, and effective from February 3, 1941, Order 58, Rule 5 was passed. This reads as follows:\nIf upon the hearing of an appeal it shall appear to the court that a new trial ought to be had, it shall be lawful for the said court, if it thinks fit, to order that the verdict and judgment be set aside and that a new trial shall be had.\nIn 1941, by 5 Geo. VI c. 16, assented to on April 10th of that year, it was enacted by s. 2 that\nThe Rules of Court made and published under s. 26 of the Judicature Act are hereby confirmed, and, insofar as any of the said Rules of Court purport to deal with substantive law, the same are hereby ratified and confirmed and declared to be within the jurisdiction of the Judges and Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council as mentioned in said s. 26 of the Judicature Act.\nIt is therefore no objection that the rule, when passed, may not have been within the power conferred by either paragraph (b) or (c) of s. 26(1) of the Act of 1940. Accordingly, in my opinion, the court below had authority to direct a new trial. I think, however, that the trial was so unsatisfactory as to render the direction with respect to a new trial the proper direction. The appeal and cross-appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island en banc setting aside the decree of the Judge of the Probate Court whereby a will bearing date October 14, 1948, and a codicil thereto bearing date November 3, 1948, were admitted to probate as the last will and a codicil thereto of William Faulkner Jardine who died on the 2nd January, 1949, and directing a new trial. The appellants, two daughters of the testator, ask that that part of the order of the Supreme Court en banc which directs a new trial be set aside and that in effect it be declared that the testator died intestate. The respondent, the executor named in the will, cross-appeals and asks that the judgment of the Court of Probate, upholding the will and codicil, be restored.\nThe Supreme Court set aside the decree of the Court of Probate on the ground that the cumulative effect of three considerations led them to the conclusion: \"that the evidence, as presented in this case, was not in a satisfactory form to enable the trial judge to assess the factual elements at their real value, or to enable an Appellate Court to decide whether or not the pronouncement of the Court below was a proper one.\"\nAfter consideration of all the evidence and of the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge and bearing in mind the advantage which he enjoyed of seeing and hearing the witnesses I have formed the opinion, although not without hesitation, that an Appellate Court could not say that he had reached a wrong conclusion. I am further of opinion that the considerations which moved the Supreme Court, weighty though they be, were not sufficient to warrant the setting aside of the judgment admitting the documents to probate; but as the majority of this Court are of opinion that the order directing a new trial should be affirmed I will refrain from discussing the evidence.\nI do, however, wish to say something about the third consideration which moved the Supreme Court to direct a new trial lest it should be inferred from the disposition which I think should be made of the appeal that I do not regard it as serious. The senior counsel for the respondent had been the draftsman of the testator's will and codicil. He was called as a witness in support of the will. His evidence was of importance. Notwithstanding the objections of counsel for the appellants he continued as counsel thereafter, cross-examining several witnesses and giving evidence in reply. This was not one of those cases which occasionally, although very rarely, arise in which some quite unexpected turn of events in the course of a trial makes it necessary to hear a counsel in the case as a witness. It must have been obvious at all times that the counsel in question was an essential witness and it was \"irregular and contrary to practice\"\u2014to use the words of Humphrey J., concurred in by Singleton and Tucker JJ. in Rex v. Secretary of State for India ([9])\u2014that he should act as counsel and witness in the same case. The fact that one of the counsel for the appellants followed the same course does not render what was done less objectionable.\nThere is no doubt but that the earlier cases in this country and in England decided that the fact of counsel also acting as a witness on behalf of his client was in itself a ground for ordering a new trial. It was so held by Patteson J. in Stones v. Byron ([10]) and by Erle J. in Deane v. Packwood ([11]), 395 n, although in the latter case it appears from the report in 8 L.T. (O.S.) 371, that counsel conceded that a new trial must be granted on the authority of Stones v. Byron. A similar view was expressed in New Brunswick in Shields v. McGrath ([12]) and in Ontario in Benedict v. Boulton ([13]) and Cameron v. Forsyth ([14]). It may be that in England the matter is still in doubt. I have found no case there which expressely overrules Stones v. Byron. With great respect for the contrary view expressed by Harrison C.J. in Davis v. The Canada Farmers Mutual Insurance Co. ([15]), at page 481 it appears to me that Cobbett v. Hudson ([16]), may not be of general application as in that case the plaintiff who, it was held, should have been allowed to testify was acting as his own advocate. In Halsbury 2nd Edition, Vol. 2 at page 523 the learned authors say:\nIt is doubtful whether a person who appears as counsel can give evidence in the same proceeding; such a course is very unusual.\nIn Eastland v. Burchall ([17]) there is a dictum of Lush J. concurred in by Mellor J. indicating that in the view of those learned judges such evidence is admissible but it was clearly obiter. The form of expression employed by Humphreys J. in Rex v. Secretary of State for India (supra) would appear to shew rather that counsel ought not to give evidence than that such evidence is legally inadmissible.\nHowever the matter may stand in England, it appears to me that such evidence is at present legally admissible in Canada.\nIn Brett v. Brett ([18]) Ewing J. after careful consideration, and under special circumstances, admitted such evidence. His judgment was affirmed ([19]), in a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Alberta delivered by Harvey C.J. who said at page 372:\nMuch criticism is offered to the evidence of Mr. Goodall, who acted as counsel throughout the major part of the trial, which evidence was received only as the result of an application made after the evidence was all thought to have been concluded. The plaintiff appeals from the order allowing the evidence to be given but it was clearly a matter for the discretion of the trial Judge, and he quite properly considered that the matter of first importance was the right of the litigants which should not be jeopardized by any oversight or mistake on the part of solicitor or counsel. Certainly the trial Judge should, and no doubt did, examine the evidence with much care, but the weight to be given to it was entirely for his consideration and if he thought proper to accept it as truthful, as he did, we would not be justified in differing from him..\nIn Ward v. McIntyre ([20]), Hazen C.J. delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for New Brunswick approved the following statement from Wigmore on Evidence:\nThere is then, in general, no rule, but only an urgent judicial reprobation forbidding counsel or attorney to testify in favour of his client. To the same effect is the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Davis v. The Canada Farmers Mutual Insurance Co. (supra) in which, at pages 477 to 483, Harrison C.J. reviews the earlier cases in England and this country.\nIn Major v. Higgins ([21]), Howard J. after a full review of the authorities concludes at page 283:\nBut, although it is widely acknowledged and authoritatively asserted to be contrary to the ethics and against the best interests of the profession for an advocate to testify on behalf of his own client in a case which he is conducting, I can find no rule of law that forbids him to do so. A canon of legal ethics, no matter how strongly approved by the members of the profession, and by the public too for that matter, has not the force of a rule of evidence and cannot be applied as such.\nIn Prince Edward Island in Grady v. Waite ([22]) Arsenault V.C. reaches a similar conclusion.\nWhile these decisions bring me to the conclusion that the evidence of counsel in the case at bar was legally admissible, each of them contains, as indeed does every case which I have read in which the matter is discussed, a clear expression of judicial disapproval of counsel following such a course. Nothing would be gained by quoting these expressions at length. An example is that of Ritchie C.J. in Bank of British North America v. McElroy ([23]):\nIt is the privilege of the party to offer the counsel as a witness: but that it is an indecent proceeding, and should be discouraged, no one can deny * * *\nIf such expressions of judicial opinion extending over a century, coupled with the repeated pronouncements of the representatives of the Bar to the same effect, have not availed to prevent counsel following such a course it is perhaps idle to hope that a further similar expression will prove effective and I shall only say that I am in agreement with the statement of Ritchie C.J., quoted above.\nHaving formed the opinion that the judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored it becomes unnecessary for me to decide whether the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island had power to direct a new trial, but the reasons of my brothers Kerwin and Kellock satisfy me that it has such power. I would dismiss the appeal, allow the cross-appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge including his order as to costs. The respondent should have his costs of this appeal, of the cross-appeal and of the appeal to the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island out of the estate and there should be no other order as to costs.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: K.

The action for damages for libel and slander was dismissed by the trial judge following the verdict of the jury but the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan ordered a new trial. The claim for slander was withdrawn from the jury by the trial judge after he had ruled out the innuendo assigned to the words by the respondent. These two rulings were not questioned before this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe words complained of, in their natural and ordinary meaning, are capable of a defamatory meaning as they appear to impute to the respondent that he has been accused of fraud.\nIn order to justify the statement that respondent was alleged to have acted fraudulently and deprived persons of their property by fraud, it must be pleaded and proved that he did in fact act fraudulently and did in fact deprive persons of their property by fraud; it is of no avail to plead that some person or persons other than the defendant had in fact made such allegations. (Watkin v. Hall (1868) L.R. 3 Q.B. 396).\nAssuming, without deciding, that a motion to strike out a Statement of Claim heard in Chambers by the Local Master is a judicial proceeding in open Court within the rule in Kimber v. Press Association Ltd. [1893] 1 Q.B. 65), it is clear that the words complained of do not purport to be a report of such proceeding, nor can they be fair comment since they do not purport to be comment or expressions of opinion.\nAppellant, although entitled to reply to the charge that he had publicly made a false and unfounded statement, lost the protection of qualified privilege by stating that the respondent was facing a suit for fraud and was said to have deprived certain persons of their property by fraud, all of which went beyond, matters reasonably germane to the charge made by the respondent. It is for the judge to rule as a matter of law whether the occasion was privileged and whether the defendant published something beyond what was germane and reasonably appropriate to the occasion so that the privilege had been exceeded. (Adam v. Ward [1917] A.C. 309).\nThe privilege of an elector is lost if the publication is made in a newspaper, and the view that a defamatory statement relating to a candidate for public office published in a newspaper is protected by qualified privilege by reason merely of the facts that an election is pending and that the statement, if true, would be relevant to the question of such candidate's fitness to hold office is untenable and is not contemplated by s. 8(2) of the Libel and Slander Act, R.S.S. 1940, c. 90.\nThere was evidence upon which, on a proper charge, the jury could decide that the defendant, in what occurred between him and the reporter, knew and intended that the report would be published in the newspaper and that such publication was publication by the defendant. (Hay v. Bingham 11 O.L.R. 148).\nThe variance between the words pleaded and the words published in the newspaper is not fatal to this action as there appears to be no substantial difference between the words as pleaded and as proved. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 1 reversing the dismissal of the respondent's action for defamation by the trial judge, following the verdict of a jury, and ordering a new trial.\nE. C. Leslie, K.C., for the appellant. On the evidence, it is submitted that the appellant was not a publisher of the libel nor in any way responsible for its publication. It is further submitted that the appellant was not in law responsible for the publication: Gatley \"On Libel and Slander\", 3rd Ed. at p. 102. The appellant relies upon the case of Parkes v. Prescott 2 to say that whether he hoped or not that his speech would be published, he made no request to have it done. The authorities show that there must be some act on the part of the defendant whereby express authorisation or indeed a request can be made out on the part of the defendant to have the statement published. It is not sufficient to prove that the publication was the natural and probable consequence of the alleged statement having been made; that sort of evidence is not relevant in determining whether or not the defendant was a publisher. The appellant did not constitute the newspaper his agent for the publication: he had no control over the newspaper nor the reporter: On this point, the cases of Ward v. Weekes 3 and Weld-Blundell v. Stephens 4 are relied on and the case of Hay v. Bingham 5 is distinguished as being obiter. There was therefore no request to publish and furthermore the natural and probable result does not here amount to a request.\nThere was between the words pleaded and those proved a variance, and as there was no difficulty in ascertaining the exact words used, the relaxation of the old strict rule respecting variance does not apply. See Gatley (supra) p. 609.\nThe statement made was not the repetition of a rumour nor was it analogous. There is no libel to say of a man that he is being sued for fraud, if it is true. The contents of the Statement of Claim was not disclosed to the public. There are no cases holding a defendant liable for merely stating that the plaintiff has been sued or that a charge has been laid against him. When such a statement is made, it is sufficient to justify the allegation that such a suit has been brought and that it is not necessary to justify the truth of the allegations contained therein: Hennessy v. Wright 6 and Fitch v. Lemon 7.\nIndependently of any question of privilege that may attach to the publication of judicial documents, such as pleadings, it is not defamatory to say that a person has been sued for fraud or charged with a criminal offence. Even if that be wrong, such a statement may be made after the Statement of Claim or charge has been referred to in Court or Chambers: Gazette Printing Co. v. Shallow 8 distinguished. Proceedings in Chambers before the Local Master are proceedings in open court. The words \"open court\" mean proceedings both at trial and in Chambers and are used in contradistinction to the words \"in camera\". See Gatley (supra) p. 332.\nThe trial judge did not mis-directed himself when he held that the statement was made on a privileged occasion. Reliance is placed on two grounds of privilege: (a) on the ground that the statement was a reply to an attack and (b) on the ground that a candidate has a right to bring to the public notice the fitness or otherwise of a candidate: Laughton v. Bishop of Sodor and Man 9, Turner v. M.G.M. Pictures Ltd. 10, Adam v. Ward 11 and Gatley (supra) p. 250.\nThe direction for a new trial was an error for the following reasons: (a) the charge was fair to the plaintiff and adverse to the defendant, (b) to rely upon non-direction, one must raise it at the trial, which was not done here and (c) a new trial should not be lightly granted.\nG. H. Yule, K.C., for the respondent. There was sufficient grounds for the Court of Appeal to order a new trial. Relies on the reasons for judgment of the Court appealed from. The appellant is responsible for the publication of the defamatory statements which appeared in the newspaper. This is a matter for the jury and had no bearing on the matter of the judgment for a new trial. As the words do not purport to be a report of any judicial proceedings, the plea of truth of the matter cannot be sustained.\nThe claim of the qualified privilege of a candidate fails in view of the evidence of the appellant that he had no intention of trying to influence the electors.\nThe sting of the libel is that the respondent obtained a farm by fraud, and the defence is not that he was guilty of fraud but that it was true that he had been sued for fraud. That is not a defence to the action: The Gazette case (supra).\nChambers is not open Court: Scott v. Scott 12.\nIt is contempt of Court to publish statements of claims before the case is decided: Chesshire v. Strauss 13 and Bowden v. Russell 14.\nThe statement of Gatley (supra) p. 430 is relied on as to the question of variation between the words pleaded and the words proved.\nIt was prejudicial to the plaintiff and contrary to public policy and fair administration of justice to admit in evidence the Statement of Claim in the action for fraud. The evidence shows that the appellant had had long ago the idea of using the press to libel the respondent.\nThe charge of the trial judge was most unfair in that he told the jury that the defendant had the privilege to defame the plaintiff.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nCartwright J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Province of Saskatchewan 15 setting aside the judgment dismissing the action pronounced by Taylor J. following the verdict of a jury and directing a new trial limited to certain issues.\nA somewhat detailed statement of the relevant facts is necessary to make clear the questions which have to be determined.\nThe action is for damages for libel and slander. The alleged slander was published in a speech made by the appellant to a public meeting at Rosthern on June 11, 1948, in the course of an election campaign. The appellant was at that time, and still is, Premier of Saskatchewan. He was seeking re-election in an election called for June 24, 1948. The respondent was also seeking election in his own constituency of Rosthern and was the Leader of the Opposition.\nIn the course of the election campaign the respondent had made public statements to the effect that it was the intention of the appellant and his party, if returned to office, to socialize the farm lands in the Province and there seems to be no doubt that the question of the socialization of farm lands was one of the issues being debated in the campaign. On the 8th of June, 1948, at a public meeting in the village of Caron in the Province, the appellant made a statement the effect of which was that the respondent and the party which he was leading were in fact those responsible for taking their lands and homesteads from the farmers in Saskatchewan, that the respondent had signed, as an officer of an investment company, a document dated January 24, 1930, stipulating for interest at the rate of 15 per cent per annum and that as a result of such document and other transactions relating to the land therein described to which the respondent was a party, a farmer and his wife had lost their lands to the investment company, its officers and agents.\nOn the 10th of June, 1948, the respondent addressed a public meeting at the city of North Battleford in Saskatchewan and referred to the allegations made by the appellant at the public meeting at Caron as being \"entirely without foundation.\"\nOn the 11th of June, 1948, in addressing a public meeting at the Town of Rosthern the appellant is alleged to have spoken the words on which the claim for slander is founded, and which are set out in the Statement of Claim as follows:\n\"Walter Tucker is facing a charge of fraud laid before the courts in August last year and which the presiding Judge very conveniently adjourned hearing until after the Provincial election,\" and the following words, namely: \"and at this time, Tucker, Goble and Giesbrecht are being sued for depriving by fraud these people of their property\", and the following words, namely: \"there is this much foundation for my remarks that incidentally Tucker got the mortgage and a second party involved in the agreement lost their farm to Tucker and the defunct Investment Company in 1939,\" and the following words, namely: \"I am sorry this was introduced but Tucker should not infer my remarks are without foundation.\"\nIt appears that the appellant did not originally plan to refer in his address at Rosthern to the statement made by the respondent at North Battleford intending to reply thereto by publishing a prepared statement in the press; but owing to being asked questions about the respondent's statement that he, the appellant, had made a charge which was entirely without foundation, he decided he ought not to delay but should deal with it in addressing the meeting.\nPrior to making this last-mentioned decision the appellant had handed to a newspaper reporter, with whom he was personally acquainted, notes summarizing the speech which he intended to make. These notes, for the reason just mentioned, contained no reference to the respondent's statement made the day before at North Battleford. The reporter, after hearing that part of the appellant's speech, quoted above, left the meeting, typed his report and returned to the meeting. The appellant had finished his speech but it is not clear on the evidence whether the meeting was still in progress. The reporter showed the appellant what he had typed and proposed to send to his paper, the Star-Phoenix. The appellant read the report and suggested a few changes which were made by the reporter who then telephoned the story to his paper. It was published the following day in the Star-Phoenix. It is on this publication, which the respondent claims was, in law, publication by the appellant, that the claim for libel is based.\nThe words which appeared in the Star-Phoenix differ somewhat from those quoted above from the Statement of Claim. The corresponding passages are as follows:\nPremier T. C. Douglas Friday night said in an address here that Walter Tucker, Liberal party leader, was facing a suit of alleged fraud laid before the court August 14 last year, and which the presiding judge \"very conveniently adjourned hearing until after the provincial election.\" \"And at this time,\" he said \"Tucker, Goble and Giesbrecht are being sued for allegedly depriving by fraud these people of their property.\" \"There is this much foundation for my remarks\", said Premier Douglas, \"that incidentally Mr. Tucker got the mortgage, and a second party involved in the agreement lost their farm to Tucker and the defunct investment company in 1939.\" \"I am very sorry this was introduced but Mr. Tucker should not infer my remarks are without foundation.\" Some time before the events set out above, one Parania Warowa had commenced an action in the Court of King's Bench, Judicial District of Prince Albert, against the respondent and others. The amended Statement of Claim in such action consists of eleven pages, contains allegations of fraud against all the defendants and makes reference to the document of January 24, 1930, mentioned above. A motion launched by the defendants to strike out substantially the whole of this pleading was heard in Chambers before the learned Local Master in January, 1948. Judgment was reserved and the Local Master was requested by counsel for the plaintiff, Warowa, to delay giving judgment to permit the filing of further material. Judgment on this motion had not been given at the date of the publication of the alleged libel, June 12, 1948.\nIt is next necessary to consider the pleadings in the case at bar. The Statement of Claim sets out that the respondent was on the 11th of June, 1948, a solicitor practising at Rosthern, Saskatchewan, and that he is still so practising, that on such date he was Provincial Leader of the Liberal party in Saskatchewan and was a candidate for the constituency of Rosthern in the election to be held on June 24, 1948 and that the appellant on the 11th of June, 1948, at a meeting in the town of Rosthern, falsely and maliciously spoke and published of and concerning the respondent to the persons at the said meeting, the words quoted above.\nAn innuendo is pleaded but the learned trial judge ruled that the words were not capable of bearing the meaning assigned to them in the innuendo. This ruling was not questioned in the Court of Appeal or before us and the action must be determined on the words as pleaded in their natural and ordinary meaning without the assignment of any innuendo.\nThere follows an allegation that the appellant knew that what he said at the meeting of June 11, 1948, would be published in the Star-Phoenix, a newspaper published at Saskatoon, that such publication was the natural and probable consequence of the speaking of the said words by the appellant, that after the meeting a newspaper reporter of the Star-Phoenix showed the appellant a transcript of the notes which he had made at the meeting and told the appellant that he proposed to have such transcript published in the Star-Phoenix and that the appellant approved the transcript and authorized its publication in the said newspaper. Damages for both slander and libel are claimed.\nThe Statement of Defence denies the speaking or publishing of the words complained of and sets up that such words are incapable of bearing the meanings assigned in the innuendo.\nThere are then set out a number of defences pleaded in the alternative in the event of its being held that the appellant did speak, or publish the alleged libel. Those which require consideration are as follows:\nFirst, a plea of justification.\nSecond, a plea (contained in paragraph 7 of the Statement of Defence) that the words published in so far as they consist of allegations of fact formed part of a fair and accurate report of proceedings publicly heard before a Court exercising judicial authority, namely before the Local Master of the Court of King's Bench of Saskatchewan sitting in Chambers at Saskatoon on or about the 15th of January, 1948, on a motion to strike out the Statement of Claim in an action brought against the respondent and others by one Parania Warowa, that the report was published in good faith for the information of the public and without any malice towards the respondent and was therefore privileged, and that in so far as the words consist of expressions of opinion they are fair comment on a matter of public interest, namely, the said judicial proceedings.\nThird, a plea of qualified privilege in which is set out a statement of the facts as to the pending election and the public statements and addresses referred to above, with emphasis on the statement made by the respondent that the appellant had made allegations which were entirely without foundation. The plea concludes:\n\u2026 If the said words set out in the Statement of Claim were spoken by the Defendant, which he does not admit but denies, then he says they were spoken under the circumstances hereinbefore set out and that as a consequence thereof the occasion was privileged since they were spoken:\n(a) by way of refutation of an allegation by the plaintiff which would injure the defendant, his Government, and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and with the sole desire of protecting as it was the defendant's duty to protect, the interests of his Government, those of the party of which he is leader, and his own interests. (b) to citizens of the Province of Saskatchewan who had a legitimate interest in the election campaign then proceeding and in the matter referred to by the defendant which was one of its principal issues. The words were spoken in good faith and in the honest belief that they were true and without malice toward the plaintiff.\nThere followed a statement of certain events, alleged to have occurred after the publication of the words complained of, which were said to be pleaded in mitigation of damages but the learned trial judge ruled that such matters were inadmissible and his ruling in that regard was not questioned in the Court of Appeal or before us.\nAt the trial the learned trial judge ruled that insofar as the respondent's claim was based on slander the words pleaded, without the innuendo, did not fall within any of the classes of spoken words which are actionable without proof of special damage and that there was neither plea nor proof of special damage. He accordingly withdrew the claim based on slander from the jury. This ruling was upheld in the Court of Appeal and was not questioned before us. We are concerned, therefore, only with the claim for libel.\nI do not think it necessary to go at length into the question whether the words as pleaded are capable of a defamatory meaning. I agree with the statement in Odgers on Libel and Slander, 6th Edition, page 16, that \"any printed or written words are defamatory which impute to the plaintiff that he has been guilty of any \u2026 fraud, dishonesty \u2026 or dishonourable conduct, or has been accused or suspected of any such misconduct,\" and the words complained of in their natural and ordinary meaning appear to me to fall within this statement. I am in agreement with the Court of Appeal that at the new trial the presiding judge should instruct the jury as a matter of law that the words are capable of being defamatory.\nThe grounds mainly relied upon by counsel for the appellant were those raised in the first, second and third alternative pleas referred to above and the following:\n(i) Lack of evidence on which it could be found that the defendant was responsible in law for the publication in the Star-Phoenix, and\n(ii) Variation between the words of the alleged libel as pleaded and as actually published. The plea of justification was contained in paragraph 6 of the Statement of Defence and was in general words as follows:\nThe defendant \u2026 says that the said words in their natural and ordinary meaning are true in substance and in fact.\nPursuant to an order of the Court, the appellant delivered the following particulars of this plea:\nWith reference to paragraph 6 of the Statement of Defence, the defendant says that he intends to prove only that in the judicial proceedings referred to in the Statement of Defence one Parania Warowa made allegations of fraud against the plaintiff, particulars of which allegations are set out in paragraph 7 of the Statement of Defence.\nIn my opinion paragraph 6 of the Statement of Defence as clarified by the particulars given is not a plea of justification at all. The sting of the words complained of being that the respondent is alleged to have acted fraudulently and to have deprived persons of their property by fraud they could be justified only by pleading and proving that he did in fact act fraudulently and did in fact deprive persons of their property by fraud. It is of no avail to plead that some person or persons other than the appellant had in fact made such allegations. This appears to me to be so well settled as to render it unnecessary to refer to the authorities other than the judgments of Blackburn J. and Lush J. in Watkin v. Hall 16. The circumstance that a libel, which a defendant has repeated rather than originated, was first published in some legal proceeding can have no effect on the plea of justification although it may become relevant to a plea that the publication by the defendant was protected by privilege.\nAs to the second plea mentioned above, there is no doubt that as stated by Lord Esher in Kimber v. Press Association Ltd. 17:\nThe rule of law is that, where there are judicial proceedings before a properly constituted judicial tribunal exercising its jurisdiction in open Court, then the publication, without malice, of a fair and accurate report of what takes place before that tribunal is privileged.\nThe question whether the motion to strike out the Statement of Claim in the Warowa action heard in Chambers by the Local Master was a judicial proceeding in open court falling within this rule was fully argued before us but does not appear to me to require decision in this case. Assuming, without deciding, that such question should be answered in the affirmative, it is clear that the words complained of do not purport to be a fair and accurate report of the proceeding before the Local Master. They do not purport to be a report of such proceeding at all. For the same reason the concluding portion of this plea is not maintainable. The words complained of cannot be fair comment for they do not purport to be comment or expressions of opinion. They are simply statements of fact.\nThe third plea mentioned above, that of qualified privilege, is made on two distinct bases.\nThe first of these is that the respondent in his address at North Battleford and in the public press had attacked the appellant, that the words complained of were published by the appellant in answer to such attack, and that the appellant was entitled in making such reply to address the same audience, as that which the respondent had selected, this is to say, the whole world. It is argued that the appellant was attacked by the respondent when the latter referred to statements made by the former as being \"entirely without foundation\", that this amounted to a charge that the appellant had publicly made a statement which was false and unfounded. In my view the appellant was entitled to reply to such a charge and his reply would be protected by qualified privilege, but I think it clear that this protection would be lost if in making his reply the appellant went beyond matters which were reasonably germane to the charge which had been brought against him. It is for the judge alone to rule as a matter of law not only whether the occasion is privileged but also whether the defendant has published something beyond what was germane and reasonably appropriate to the occasion so that the privilege does not extend thereto. See Adam v. Ward 18 at pages 318, 321, 328, 329, 332 and 340.\nIn my view the claim of qualified privilege made on this basis in the case at bar fails. It is true as was said by Lord Shaw of Dunfermline in Adam v. Ward (supra) at page 347, that the whole question of the repudiation of a charge claimed to be false has not to be weighed in nice scales; but it was, I think, going entirely beyond anything that was necessary to the refutation of the charge made by the respondent to state that he was facing a suit for fraud and was said to have deprived certain persons of their property by fraud. The charge which the respondent had made against the appellant was in substance that the appellant had falsely stated that he, the respondent, had been a party to the exaction of 15 per cent interest on a mortgage. It was open to the appellant in replying to this charge to bring forward any matter going to shew that his statement was true but the allegation that the plaintiff had been sued for fraud and had taken other persons' property by fraud was unconnected with the matters in controversy.\nThe second basis on which qualified privilege is asserted is that the defendant as an elector, a candidate for election and the leader of his party had a duty to communicate to those having a legitimate interest in the result of such election facts which he honestly believed to be true, relevant to the fitness, or otherwise, for office of other candidates offering themselves for election.\nIt has often been held that qualified privilege attaches to communications made by an elector to his fellow electors of matters regarding a candidate which he honestly believes to be true and which, if true, would be relevant to the question of such candidate's fitness for office. See, for example, Gatley on Libel and Slander, 3rd Edition, pages 250 and 251 and cases there cited. It is unnecessary on this appeal to decide whether such privilege is limited to publications made by an elector and to an elector or electors all of whom have a right to vote for the candidate about whom the communication is made and, if it is not so strictly limited, what is its extent. It is settled that whatever may be the extent of such a privilege it is lost if the publication is made in a newspaper.\nDuncombe v. Daniell 19 was an action for libel based on publication in a newspaper of statements defamatory of a candidate for election. There was a plea of qualified privilege. At page 102 of the last-mentioned report, Lord Denman C.J. said:\nHowever large may be the privileges of electors, it would be extravagant to suppose, that they can justify the publication to all the world of facts injurious to the character of any person who happens to stand in the situation of a candidate. The other members of the Court, Littledale, Williams and Coleridge, JJ. concurred. It is clear from the judgment in this case and also from expressions in De Crespigny v. Wellesly 20 and in Adam v. Ward (supra), that publication in a newspaper is publication to the world.\nDuncombe v. Daniell is cited as an authoritative statement of the law in Gatley on Libel and Slander (supra) at pages 251 and 278 and in Odgers on Libel and Slander, (supra), at pages 171 and 246. The principle which it enunciates, that the privilege of an elector will be lost if the publication is unduly wide, has been applied repeatedly, see for example: Anderson v. Hunter 21, Bethell v. Mann 22 and Lang v. Willis 23.\nThe view that a defamatory statement relating to a candidate for public office published in a newspaper is protected by qualified privilege by reason merely of the facts that an election is pending and that the statement, if true, would be relevant to the question of such candidate's fitness to hold office is, I think, untenable. The terms of section 8 of the Libel and Slander Act, R.S.S. 1940, c. 90, and particularly subsection 2 thereof would seem to indicate that such a view was remote from the contemplation of the Legislature of Saskatchewan.\nIn my opinion, the plea of qualified privilege on this basis also fails.\nFor these reasons I am respectfully of opinion that the learned trial judge should have ruled before the case went to the jury that no case of qualified privilege had been made out. I can not find that the learned trial judge made a clear and definite ruling on this point but the effect of his charge was to give the jury to understand that the statements complained of were protected by privilege and that such protection would be lost only if the jury found that the appellant had acted with express malice.\nIt is next necessary to consider whether there was evidence on which the jury could find that the publication in the Star-Phoenix was publication by the defendant. As there is to be a new trial it is not desirable to discuss the evidence but the law should be made clear to the new jury. Gatley on Libel and Slander, (supra) at pages 439 and 440 states the position correctly\nA man who writes a libellous article or letter, and sends it to the editor of a newspaper is liable for the damage caused by such publication. An express request to publish the article or letter need not be proved; the fact that he sent it to the editor is sufficient evidence that he authorized or intended it to be published \u2026 If a man hands a copy of a slanderous speech to a reporter to publish or requests a reporter to take the speech down and publish it, or an outline or summary of it, he will be taken to constitute the reporter an agent for the purpose of publication, and be answerable for the result.\nIn Odgers on Libel and Slander (supra) it is put thus at page 141:\nThus, it (a request to print or publish) may be inferred from the defendant's conduct in sending his manuscript to the editor of a magazine, or making a statement to the reporter of a newspaper, with the knowledge that they will be sure to publish it, and without any effort to restrain their so doing.\nIn Hay v. Bingham 24, the Court of Appeal for Ontario decided:\nThere was evidence from which the jury might infer that the defendant knew that he was speaking to a reporter and speaking for publication, and that he authorized what he said to be published in a newspaper. It was not necessary that there should have been an express request to publish: Odgers on Libel and Slander, 4th ed. p. 161. The defendant's object, as he admits, was to put himself right, as he thought, with the public. He must have known that this was not likely to be accomplished by a mere private explanation to the person he was speaking to; and his visit to the newspaper office on the following morning, and his conversation there with the reporter plainly suggest the inference that he had authorized the report and was substantially satisfied with it.\nIt is true that in that case the Court also decided that the words complained of were not capable of the meaning ascribed to them and therefore dismissed the action but the extract quoted is part of the ratio decidendi and with it I agree. A jury would be entitled to consider all the circumstances and I agree that there was evidence upon which, on a proper charge, they could decide that the defendant, in what occurred between him and the reporter, knew and intended that the report would be published. There remains the defence that the alleged libel, as pleaded, varied from the words actually published in the newspaper which, owing to the claim for slander having been disposed of, is the only publication with which we are concerned. There were two variations between the words as published and as pleaded: (i) The opening words of the alleged libel as pleaded are: \"Walter Tucker is facing a charge of fraud laid before the courts \u2026\". As published, the corresponding words were: \"that Walter Tucker, Liberal Party Leader was facing a suit of alleged fraud laid before the court \u2026\". (ii) The next words, as pleaded, are: \"And at this time Tucker, Goble, and Giesbrecht are being sued for depriving by fraud these people of their property.\" In the corresponding words as published, the word, \"allegedly\" appears before the word \"depriving.\"\nCounsel for the respondent did not ask at the trial to have the statement of claim amended to make the words pleaded conform exactly to the words as published and we therefore have to consider whether the variance set out above is fatal to the action. In my opinion it is not. The statement in Gatley on Libel and Slander (supra) at page 609: \"If the words proved convey to the mind of a reasonable man practically the same meaning as the words set out, the variance will be immaterial,\" is supported by the cases there cited. The sting of the words as pleaded is that the respondent is charged with fraud and is being sued for depriving certain people of their property by fraud. As these words clearly import that the charge and suit are pending the addition or omission of the words \"alleged\" or \"allegedly\" is, I think, of little significance. A pending charge or a pending suit partakes of necessity of the nature of an allegation as yet not established and there appears to be no substantial difference between the words as pleaded and as proved.\nFor the above reasons I am of opinion that the order of the Court of Appeal directing a new trial limited to the issues set out in the formal order of that Court should be affirmed. At the trial, against the objection of counsel for the plaintiff, the learned trial judge admitted in evidence the document of January 24, 1930 and the Statement of Claim in the Warowa action and permitted them to be marked as exhibits. I agree with the Court of Appeal that both these documents should be excluded at the new trial. Neither is relevant to any of the issues to which such new trial is limited by the order of the Court of Appeal.\nNo other question having been argued before us, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacPherson, Milliken, Leslie & Tyerman.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Gilbert H.

After his death in November 1948, the will was probated.\nThe respondent, deceased's only child, brought action in annulment of the will on the grounds of lack of essential formalities, of mistake as to the nature of the document signed and of non-competency of the testator. Subsidiarily, the respondent alleged that this will had been expressly revoked on 29 April, 1947\u2014seven days after its completion\u2014 by an holograph will in her favour which could not be found but which she claimed to be entitled to prove by oral evidence.\nThe trial judge found that the formalities essential to the validity of the first will had been complied with. He further found that a second will revoking the first had been made, but since it could not be found he presumed that it had been destroyed animus revocandi and that therefore the first was revived. The Court of Appeal for Quebec found that the deceased did not give to the first document the free adhesion of an enlightened will.\nHeld (Taschereau J. dissenting), that the appeal should be dismissed and that the deceased died intestate.\nPer Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. (Taschereau and Kellock JJ. dissenting) (Rand J. expressing no opinion): When the deceased affixed his signature to the first document, he did not realize that he was signing a will and, furthermore, his mind and will did not accompany the physical act of execution; and in the determination of that question, the circumstances surrounding the making of the second will must be taken into account. (Mignault v. Malo 1 followed).\nRinfret C.J. was of the opinion that the holograph will could be proven by oral testimony, but the ratio of his disposition of the case rested on the nullity of the first will.\nPer Rand, Kellock and Cartwright JJ.: It was possible under the law of Quebec to prove by oral testimony that the holograph will\u2014which was not found\u2014had been made and contained a revoking clause.\nPer Kerwin, Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: The respondent having failed to establish the precise fact as a result of which the holograph will was fortuitously lost or destroyed as required by Art. 860 of the Civil Code, this will could not be proven by oral testimony and, furthermore, it was not possible to divide it so as to treat it only as a writing revoking the first will within the meaning of Art. 892(2) since the revocation contained in a will not legally proved is null.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 2, reversing the decision of the trial judge and holding that the contested will was void.\nGuy Hudon K.C. and Pierre Letarte K.C. for the appellant. The will of April 22, 1947, was valid. All the formalities essential to the validity of that will made, in the form derived from the laws of England, as listed in Art. 851 C.C., had been complied with. Reliance was placed on Wynne v. Wynne 3 and Gingras v. Gingras 4.\nThe evidence shows that the testator was sane and nothing justifies the suggestion that he did, at any time up to his death, show any signs of mental weakness. It was therefore, in view of that, incumbent upon the respondent to establish precise, concording and conclusive facts showing that at the time of the making of the will, he was not competent to make a valid will. Respondent did not allege nor prove any one fact to show that the testator was not fully in possession of all his mental faculties.\nThe respondent, furthermore, has failed to establish without any doubt that the testator committed an error and signed the document not knowing that it was his will. The statements of fact on which the Court of Appeal based its conclusion that there had been error are contrary to the evidence and to the findings of the trial judge and do not justify the judgment appealed from. Baptist v. Baptist 5 and Faulkner v. Faulkner 6 referred to.\nThere is no evidence whatsoever of any undue influence, pressure or fraudulent manoeuvres or suggestions which would amount to same: Mayrand v. Dussault 7 and Kaulbach v. Archbold 8.\nEven had the testator made the second will mentioned by the respondent, the latter would not be receivable to prove it by testimony. Para. 6 of Art. 1233 C.C. fixes the general conditions under which a writing which has been lost by unforeseen accident may be proved by testimony. The respondent did not allege nor prove any fact that constitutes or might constitute an unforeseen accident and nothing in the evidence heard on either side proves an unforeseen accident, which expression excludes a voluntary act of the testator and implies a material fact or an exterior event completely distinct from the voluntary destruction of the instrument by the testator. The unforeseen accident must be a fact which it was impossible to foresee and the evidence shows the existence of no such fact. In our law there is no presumption of loss resulting from the failure to produce the will after the death of the testator. The expression \"unforeseen accident\" in 1233 C.C. has definitively a broader meaning than \"fortuitous event\" in 860 C.C.\nThe provisions of Art. 860 C.C. are precise and they limit the general rule as set out in Art. 1233 C.C. The former deals with three circumstances but respondent's action only alleges the loss before the death of the testator and without his knowledge. Under that article, it was incumbent upon the respondent to prove: (a) The destruction or loss. Failure to produce the will at the time of the death of the testator does not in itself constitute a shadow of evidence of such loss or destruction; (b) the fortuitous event; (c) the relation causa causans between the loss or destruction on one hand and the fortuitous event on the other; (d) a date sufficiently exact on which such destruction or loss would have taken place in order to determine if such destruction or loss took place before the death of the testator; (e) the ignorance of the testator. Neither the destruction, loss, fortuitous event, date or ignorance of the testator have been proved.\nFurthermore, secondary evidence is a matter of exception and the conditions for its admissibility must be previously established: Beaudry-Lacantinerie 3rd Ed., Vol. XV, p. 328 and Mignault Vol. VI, p. 7.\nArts. 892, 895 and 896 C.C. deal with the revocation. In order that the contention of the respondent that even if the second will did not avail as a will, the cancellation clause contained therein could stand by itself and be admitted in evidence, be sound, it is pointed out that to be cancelled, the first will should be revoked by a notarial act or by an other written act in which the testator's change of intention is expressly stated (892 C.C. para. 2). It is again pointed out that such written act should be legally proved and that Art. 1233 para. 6 requires, in case of loss of this written act, evidence of an unforeseen event which brought about such loss. The first will was not destroyed nor was it torn or erased, and it was regularly probated. (892 C.C. para. 3). Neither is there any question of alienation or of judicial revocation. (892 C.C. para. 4 and 893 C.C). It was not revoked by a posterior will which was legally proved. (892 C.C. para. 1). It is expressly enacted by Art. 895 C.C. that if the will is valid, properly proved, but remains without effect in its execution, the revocation remains. On the other hand, if the will is null on account of a defect of form, the revocation is null, that is, it is indivisible from the will itself, and if the will is non-existent as a will because it is not proved, the cancellation clause is non-existent for the same reason. (Demolombe, Vol. 22, Tome V, p. 131, Laurent, Vol. 14, p. 202 and Aubry et Rau, 5th Ed., Vol. 11, p. 511). Furthermore, under reserve and assuming proper proof of the second will, it was itself revoked by the destruction thereof by the testator with the indication of his intention to revive the former instrument. There are in the evidence sufficient grounds to conclude with the trial judge that the testator had decided to destroy the second will in order to revive the first. Art. 896 C.C. gives the trial judge the widest discretionary powers and authorizes him to take into consideration not only the circumstances, but even the indications of the testator's intention. The legislator does not mention formal proof of the testator's intention, it is sufficient that there be indications of this intention to empower the Court to make a decision. (Beaudry-Lacantinerie, Vol. XI, 3rd. Ed., p. 386 and Moreau v. Ogilvie Flour Mills 9.\nGustave Monette K.C., Maurice Gagn\u00e9 and Jacques Flynn for the respondent. The contested will was not executed by the testator with the full knowledge and appreciation of what he was doing and is void under Art. 831 C.C. for lack of a valid consent thereto. Art. 831 C.C. which requires the testator to be of sound intellect does not provide only for the nullity of the will made by the insane proper but also of the will made by a testator whose weakness of mind does not permit him to appreciate the character and the consequences of the act which he makes. (Baptist v. Baptist 10 and Jeannotte v. Jeannotte 11) On the other hand, whatever be the reason for the error, if a person signs a will believing that he signs something else, it will also be void under 992 C.C. The evidence, when the question of error is raised after the death of the testator, may be made by way of presumptions resulting directly from the acts, the declarations and the behaviour of the testator before, during and after the execution of the will. The three following propositions are submitted on this point: (a) The testator was exposed to temporary derangements of intellect and to weakness of understanding, propitious to an error or confusion; (b) the testator did not give a valid consent to the contested will and (c) the nature of the disposition contained in the contested will is not one which a man with the full knowledge of what he was doing, would have reasonably made under the circumstances.\nThe contested will is also void for lack of certain formalities required by Art. 851 C.C.: the testator did not personally request the witnesses to sign the will and did not in their presence acknowledge the document as his will nor attest his signature as having been subscribed thereto. All the formalities required by 851 C.C are essential and are not only a question of form. (Gingras v. Gingras supra and Mignault, Vol. 4, p. 302).\nThe contested will is void under Art. 892 C.C, having been revoked by the subsequent holograph will of April 29, which could not be found and which the respondent claims to be entitled to prove by verbal evidence. This second will is only relied upon by the respondent as a revocation of the contested will. In view of the fact that the revoking will could not be found, the respondent, in order to succeed, has to satisfy the Court that: (a) This holograph will has existed; (b) The verbal evidence of the contents of this revoking will is admissible (860, 1233 C.C.); (c) The lost will was a valid revocation of the contested one (892, 894 C.C.); (d) The contested will has not revived (896 C.C).\nAs to (a), the evidence is clear on that point and also that it was valid as to form.\nAs to (b), Art. 860 C.C is concerned with the final proof of a lost will. It determines first, the rules of admissibility of verbal evidence and then, creates certain presumptions resulting from the loss or destruction of a will. The Codifiers and Mignault are of the opinion that the rule of admissibility of verbal evidence of a lost will is the same as the one provided for any other document. According to the authors and the jurisprudence, the meaning of \"fortuitous event\" in 860 C.C. and \"unforeseen accident\" in 1233 C.C. is the same. The rule is exactly the same under both dispositions, and the general rule is to the effect that the claiming party must establish that the non production of the document of which he seeks to adduce verbal evidence, is not due to his fault. Further, the impossibility to produce the document because of the act of a third person is equivalent to an unforeseen acci- dent or fortuitous event. (Demolombe, Vol. 30, No. 202, Mignault, Vol. 6, p. 75, Ball v. Roland 12, Bienvenue v. Lacaille 13, Ren\u00e9 v. Mallette 14, Brown v. Brown 15 and Barkwell v. Barkwell 16). The searches made were sufficient to discharge the onus. It is quite clear that the fact that the will cannot be produced is not the result of the respondent's fault or negligence. Since respondent never had control of the document, there is no obligation to establish without doubt the date and the manner or accident in which the will may have been lost or destroyed. The loss is one which occurred by inexplicable circumstances while the document was in the hands of another and such loss is equivalent to an unforeseen or fortuitous event.\nSince the respondent is not asking for the probate of the lost will and is not seeking a declaration that she is the universal legatee thereunder, she is entitled to prove the contents of the will for purposes of revocation of a prior will, even if the will, by reason of its loss or destruction, is to be presumed to be itself revoked. There is nothing in para. 3 of Art. 860 C.C. that can be construed as meaning that a will presumably revoked as a result of its loss, cannot be proved by verbal evidence for any legal purpose, such as the proof of a revocation therein contained. Mignault takes the same view at p. 278, Vol. 4. To say that a will, presumably revoked as a result of its loss or destruction can never be proved by verbal evidence leads to ridiculous consequences and brings Art. 860 C.C. into conflict with many well settled principles of our law as well as with Arts. 892 and 896 C.C.\nEven if it should be true that paras. 2 and 3 of Art. 860 C.C. contain rules of evidence with the consequence that the respondent would have the further onus of establishing that the will was lost without the knowledge of the testator or alternatively that he manifested his intention of maintaining its provisions, the respondent has satisfied such onus.\nAs to (c), the dispositions of Arts. 892 and 895 C.C. are to the effect that a will may be revoked by another will either expressly or impliedly and the revoking will must be valid as to form. These two conditions were established in the evidence and also that it was made subsequently to the contested will.\nAs to (d), the meaning of Art. 896 C.C. is that a will once it is revoked, remains without effect unless the testator should have made some express disposition to the contrary or unless there be in evidence circumstances and indications of the intention of the testator to the effect that the prior will should be revived. Therefore, assuming the verbal evidence of the contents of the lost will to be admissible, the contested will has been revoked and cannot revive in the absence of such evidence. Moreover once the revocation was established, the onus was on the appellant. That onus was not satisfied. The respondent, without prejudice to its position, has even undertaken to prove that the testator never had the intention to revive his first will.\nHudon K.C. replied.\nThe Chief Justice: M. J. A. F. Langlais, qui habitait Lancaster, aux \u00c9tats-Unis, vint demeurer dans la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec deux ans avant sa mort. Il a fait son testament le 22 avril 1947 en faveur de sa soeur, qui est l'appelante. Ce testament fut contest\u00e9 par sa fille, qui est l'intim\u00e9e.\nLes motifs de la contestation sont que:\n(1) Le testament en faveur de l'appelante, fait suivant la forme d\u00e9riv\u00e9e de la Loi d'Angleterre, n'est pas rev\u00eatu des formalit\u00e9s exig\u00e9es par l'article 851 du Code Civil;\n(2) Lorsque ce testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, M. Langlais ne jouissait pas de toutes ses facult\u00e9s mentales, et, dans ces conditions, l'\u00e9crit invoqu\u00e9 comme testament \"n'a pas re\u00e7u l'adh\u00e9sion libre d'une volont\u00e9 \u00e9clair\u00e9e\".\n(3) Le testateur ne s'est pas rendu compte qu'il signait un testament, mais qu'il aurait cru signer autre chose;\n(4) Sept jours apr\u00e8s le testament contest\u00e9, Langlais l'a r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 par un testament olographe valide et qui doit pr\u00e9valoir. Sur ce point, l'explication est que, inform\u00e9 par un ami que, sans le savoir, il avait r\u00e9ellement sign\u00e9 un testament le 22 avril, il s'empressa, le 29 avril, de faire un testament olographe pour mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le testament qui est maintenant contest\u00e9. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis que toutes les formalit\u00e9s requises par la loi \u00e9taient remplies et observ\u00e9es dans l'ex\u00e9cution du testament du 22 avril 1947.\nElle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement d'avis que Langlais savait qu'il avait fait un testament, le 22 avril 1947, mais elle ne pr\u00e9cise pas qu'il s'en rendait compte au moment o\u00f9 il l'a sign\u00e9.\nComme le fait remarquer particuli\u00e8rement l'honorable Juge Pratte, de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) 17, dans ses notes, \"il convient de noter que le premier juge ne s'est pas prononc\u00e9 express\u00e9ment sur la sanit\u00e9 d'esprit du testateur.\"\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9galement \u00e9cart\u00e9 le motif que Langlais aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 la victime d'une erreur. Cette erreur eut pu se d\u00e9duire des d\u00e9claration faites, d\u00e8s le soir m\u00eame, par le testateur \u00e0 mademoiselle Ouellet, qui avait servi de t\u00e9moin au testament du 22 avril, et \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'abb\u00e9 Brochu, quelques jours apr\u00e8s. Mais, de l'avis de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, \"les preuves de l'accomplissement des formalit\u00e9s requises pour le testament du 22 avril 1947 sont tellement pr\u00e9cises et certaines qu'elles ne pourraient \u00eatre mises de c\u00f4t\u00e9 par cette question et r\u00e9ponse dont parle mademoiselle Ouellet.\"\nEnfin, sur l'existence du second testament (qui n'a pu \u00eatre retrouv\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la mort de Langlais), la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure s'est prononc\u00e9 en d\u00e9cidant que ce testament avait exist\u00e9, qu'il revoquait le testament du 22 avril 1947, \"pourvu toutefois qu'il laissait subsister la r\u00e9vocation; mais s'il d\u00e9truisait le document qui r\u00e9voquait, il devait savoir que la r\u00e9vocation projet\u00e9e devenait caduque.\"\nCe second testament avait d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 \u00e0 la garde de l'abb\u00e9 Brochu. Un an apr\u00e8s, savoir: en juin 1948, Langlais vint le reprendre en disant qu'il d\u00e9sirait y faire des modifications; mais, ajoute le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, personne ne l'a vu apr\u00e8s cela. Le juge en conclut que \"le fait de reprendre le document pour le modifier, impliquait qu'il allait d\u00e9truire le premier, et le remplacer par un autre; s'il n'y avait que des modifications tout en laissant subsister les premi\u00e8res dispositions, il n'avait qu'\u00e0 ajouter par codicile; du moment qu'il d\u00e9truisait le premier (N.B.\u2014le juge ici veut dire le testament olographe qui r\u00e9voquait le testament en la forme d\u00e9riv\u00e9e de la Loi d'Angleterre), Langlais mit fin \u00e0 tout son contenu, et s'il d\u00e9sirait remettre en vigueur quelque partie de ce qu'il avait d\u00e9truit, il devait le faire express\u00e9ment; il n'a pas fait \u00e7a, et ne faut-il pas conclure qu'il ne d\u00e9sira pas revivre ce qu'il avait d\u00e9truit \u2026 si, lors de sa mort, cinq mois plus tard, ce testament n'existait plus, il y a \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer qu'il l'a d\u00e9truit; de l'avis de cette Cour (Sup\u00e9rieure), le dossier n'autorise pas d'autre pr\u00e9somption de fait, et des intentions qu'il aurait exprim\u00e9es verbalement ne pourraient constituer un testament, et ne pourraient constituer une r\u00e9vocation de testament.\"\nAvec ces consid\u00e9rations l'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance en vint \u00e0 la conclusion que le testament du 22 avril 1947 devait \u00eatre reconnu comme l\u00e9gal et valable, et qu'il devait \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ledit testament n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9voqu\u00e9.\nL'action de l'intim\u00e9e fut donc rejet\u00e9e.\nLe jugement formel de la Cour d'Appel 18 fait remarquer d'abord \"que le premier juge a trouv\u00e9 que les formalit\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 du testament attaqu\u00e9 auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplies ; et que c'est de cela seulement qu'il a conclu que le testateur avait d\u00fb comprendre ce qu'il faisait en signant ce testament; \u2026 que tout en reconnaissant que le testateur avait, le 29 avril 1947, fait un second testament qui r\u00e9voquait le premier, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le fait que ce dernier testament n'avait pu \u00eatre retrouv\u00e9 faisait pr\u00e9sumer que le testateur l'avait volontairement d\u00e9truit dans l'intention de laisser subsister le testament du 22 avril 1947.\"\nMais la Cour du Banc du Roi, suivant ce que Langlais avait lui-m\u00eame d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 garde Ouellet quelques minutes apr\u00e8s qu'il eut sign\u00e9 le testament attaqu\u00e9, consid\u00e9ra que Langlais ne se serait pas rendu compte qu'il avait sign\u00e9 un testament, mais qu'il aurait cru signer autre chose; d'autant plus que, par la suite, il fit d'autres d\u00e9clarations, au m\u00eame effet, \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, ainsi qu'\u00e0 l'abb\u00e9 Brochu devant qui il avait fait, le 29 avril, le testament olographe invoqu\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e. Puis, le jugement formel contient le consid\u00e9rant suivant:\nCONSID\u00c9RANT qu'il ressort de l'ensemble de la preuve qu'au moment o\u00f9 il a fait le testament du 22 avril, Firmin Langlais ne s'est pas rendu compte de ce qu'il faisait, mais qu'il croyait faire autre chose; et que l'\u00e9crit sign\u00e9 dans ces conditions n'a pas re\u00e7u l'adh\u00e9sion libre d'une volont\u00e9 \u00e9clair\u00e9e, et que, partant, il doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9.\nEt, comme l'intim\u00e9e est la seule h\u00e9riti\u00e8re l\u00e9gale de Firmin Langlais, la Cour du Banc du Roi fit droit \u00e0 l'appel, annula le testament fait par Firmin Langlais, le 22 avril 1947, d\u00e9clara l'intim\u00e9e la seule h\u00e9riti\u00e8re l\u00e9gale de ce dernier et ordonna \u00e0 l'appelante de rendre compte des biens d\u00e9laiss\u00e9s par Langlais et de les remettre \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nD'apr\u00e8s moi, le testament du 29 avril a effectivement r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 celui du 22 avril; et, en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance, qui a reconnu l'existence du testament du 29 avril, ainsi que le fait de la r\u00e9vocation, qui y \u00e9tait contenue, du testament du 22 avril, a commis une erreur de droit manifeste en d\u00e9cidant que la destruction (que, d'ailleurs, il a pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e) du second testament avait eu pour effet de faire revivre le premier.\nDevant la Cour Supr\u00eame, le savant avocat de l'appelante n'a pas contest\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du juge de premi\u00e8re instance sur le fait de l'existence du testament du 29 avril et le fait que ce testament contenait la r\u00e9vocation du testament du 22 avril, sauf qu'il a discut\u00e9 l'admissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\nSur cette question, il y a lieu d'abord de voir ce que dit l'article 1233 du Code Civil, en vertu duquel la preuve testimoniale est admise \"dans les cas o\u00f9 la preuve \u00e9crite a \u00e9t\u00e9 perdue par cas impr\u00e9vu, ou se trouve en la possession de la partie adverse, ou d'un tiers, sans collusion de la part de la partie r\u00e9clamante, et ne peut \u00eatre produite\" (sous-paragraphe 6).\nIci, il fut prouv\u00e9 et accept\u00e9 par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure que le testament du 29 avril avait exist\u00e9, qu'il contenait la r\u00e9vocation du testament ant\u00e9rieur, mais que le document lui-m\u00eame ne pouvait \u00eatre produit \"sans collusion de la part de la partie r\u00e9clamante.\" La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 la suite de la mort de Langlais, toutes les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, m\u00eame celles qui n'avaient pas vu le testament olographe, firent une recherche diligente pour le trouver dans tous les endroits o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait possible ou probable que ce testament pouvait \u00eatre. Elles ne le trouv\u00e8rent pas. D'apr\u00e8s la jurisprudence constante, c'est l\u00e0 tout ce qui peut \u00eatre exig\u00e9 pour \u00e9tablir la perte d'une preuve \u00e9crite et pour donner ouverture \u00e0 la preuve testimoniale. Le savant procureur de l'appelante a beaucoup insist\u00e9, au cours de son argumentation, pour signaler que le sous paragraphe 6 contient les mots: \"Dans les cas o\u00f9 la preuve \u00e9crite a \u00e9t\u00e9 perdue par cas impr\u00e9vu\", et il en d\u00e9duisait qu'il fallait, pour l'intim\u00e9e, prouver que le testament du 29 avril avait \u00e9t\u00e9 perdu \"par cas impr\u00e9vu\". Mais cette exigence est exag\u00e9r\u00e9e et n'est pas admise par la doctrine; d'autant plus que, si l'on peut supposer des cas o\u00f9 celui qui invoque un document perdu peut \u00e9tablir de quelle fa\u00e7on il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9, comme, par exemple, perdu au cours d'un incendie, ou perdu parce qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9chapp\u00e9 \u00e0 la mer ou dans un fleuve, dans la majorit\u00e9 des cas le fait m\u00eame qu'il est perdu implique qu'il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 par cas impr\u00e9vu. La plupart du temps, la perte n'en est constat\u00e9e que parce que l'on ne peut pas le retrouver. Ce n'est pas au moment m\u00eame o\u00f9 la perte s'effectue que l'on s'en aper\u00e7oit, ce n'est que plus tard, et, quelquefois, beaucoup plus tard que, lorsqu'on proc\u00e8de \u00e0 le chercher, il devient impossible de le retracer et qu'il faut alors se rendre \u00e0 l'\u00e9vidence que le document est perdu. Cela m\u00eame constitue le cas impr\u00e9vu dont parle le Code, car, dans ces circonstances, il est \u00e9vident que celui qui a eu le document en mains et \u00e0 qui il est devenu impossible de le retrouver n'a, en aucune fa\u00e7on, pr\u00e9vu le cas.\nIl me para\u00eet donc que si l'article 1233 (6) constitue la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale concernant la preuve testimoniale d'un document \u00e9crit qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 perdu, l'intim\u00e9e, dans le cas qui nous occupe, a justifi\u00e9 des conditions exigibles pour que le testament olographe du 29 avril 1947 put \u00eatre prouv\u00e9 verbalement. C'est, d'ailleurs, ce qu'admet, en l'esp\u00e8ce, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que ce testament avait exist\u00e9 et qu'il contenait la r\u00e9vocation du testament ant\u00e9rieur.\nMais l'article 860 du Code Civil traite \u00e9galement du cas o\u00f9 la minute ou l'original d'un testament ont \u00e9t\u00e9 perdus ou d\u00e9truits par cas fortuit, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du testateur, ou sont d\u00e9tenus sans collusion par la partie adverse ou par un tiers. Il \u00e9dicte que, pour ce cas, la preuve de ce testament peut \u00eatre faite en la mani\u00e8re r\u00e9gl\u00e9e pour le cas quant aux autres actes et \u00e9crits au titre Des obligations. Il r\u00e9f\u00e8re donc pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 1233 (6). Le m\u00eame article 860 C.C. pourvoit au cas o\u00f9 le testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truit ou perdu avant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du testateur, sans qu'il ait connu le fait, et, alors, la preuve peut \u00e9galement s'en faire comme si l'accident n'\u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9c\u00e8s. Enfin, si le testateur a connu la destruction ou la perte du testament et s'il n'y a pas suppl\u00e9\u00e9, il est cens\u00e9 l'avoir r\u00e9voqu\u00e9, \u00e0 moins d'une manifestation post\u00e9rieure de sa volont\u00e9 d'en maintenir les dispositions.\nCet article se trouve dans la Section III du chapitre des testaments qui est intitul\u00e9e: \"De la V\u00e9rification et de la Preuve des Testaments.\"\nLe savant avocat de l'intim\u00e9e a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que l'on aurait pu se demander si l'article 860 ne s'applique pas uniquement \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification d'un testament. Sur ce point, le Rapport des Commissaires lui donne tort. Il d\u00e9clare, au contraire, que cet article \"ne s'occupe pas de la v\u00e9rification, mais de la preuve finale m\u00eame du testament perdu, d\u00e9truit ou rec\u00e9l\u00e9; il est conforme aux autorit\u00e9s des deux origines, et aussi \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 quant aux actes en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral au titre des obligations.\" Le Rapport des Commissaires ajoute: \"La distinction entre le cas o\u00f9 le testateur a connu la perte de l'acte et celui o\u00f9 il ne l'a pas connue, forme le caract\u00e8re particulier de la pr\u00e9sente disposition.\"\nEn effet, le premier paragraphe de l'article 860 C.C. suppose le cas o\u00f9 la minute ou l'original d'un testament ont \u00e9t\u00e9 perdus ou d\u00e9truits apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du testateur. Dans ce cas, il est \u00e9vident que le testateur n'y a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour rien et la preuve peut en \u00eatre faite \"en la mani\u00e8re r\u00e9gl\u00e9e pour le cas quant aux autres actes et \u00e9crits au titre Des Obligations.\" (C.C. article 1233 (6)).\nLe second paragraphe de l'article 860 suppose le cas o\u00f9 le testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truit ou perdu avant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du testateur, mais, hors la connaissance de ce dernier. Dans ce cas, \"la preuve peut \u00e9galement s'en faire comme si l'accident n'\u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\"\nMais le troisi\u00e8me paragraphe de l'article 860 dispose du cas o\u00f9 le testateur a connu la destruction ou la perte du testament. Dans ce cas s'il n'y a pas suppl\u00e9\u00e9, \"il est cens\u00e9 l'avoir r\u00e9voqu\u00e9, \u00e0 moins d'une manifestation post\u00e9rieure de la volont\u00e9 d'en maintenir les dispositions.\" La distinction faite dans l'article m\u00eame entre les diff\u00e9rents cas qu'il suppose \u00e9claire, \u00e0 mon avis, la question qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e devant cette Cour dans la pr\u00e9sente cause et qui est de savoir si les mots \"par cas fortuit\", qui se trouvent dans le premier paragraphe, s'appliquent \u00e0 la fois au mot \"perdus\" et au mot \"d\u00e9truits\", ou s'ils ne s'appliquent, au contraire, qu'\u00e0 ce dernier mot seulement.\nL'on constate que tout l'article 860 fait r\u00e9ellement la distinction entre le cas o\u00f9 le testateur lui-m\u00eame a connu la perte ou la destruction et le cas o\u00f9 il ne l'a pas connue. Et c'est bien sur cela que les codificateurs ont attir\u00e9 l'attention dans leur Rapport. Il est, en effet, parfaitement logique de supposer que, si le testateur a connu la perte ou la destruction (ainsi, d'ailleurs, que l'\u00e9dicte le troisi\u00e8me paragraphe), on doit en conclure qu'il a eu l'intention de le r\u00e9voquer; \"\u00e0 moins\", ajoute ce paragraphe, \"qu'il ait post\u00e9rieurement manifest\u00e9 la volont\u00e9 d'en maintenir les dispositions.\"\nEn ce sens, les mots \"par cas fortuit\", dans le premier paragraphe de l'article 860 \u00e9taient essentiels, puisqu'ils ont pour but de faire la distinction entre une destruction qui r\u00e9sulterait de l'acte du testateur lui-m\u00eame et une destruction qui r\u00e9sulterait d'un \u00e9v\u00e9nement ext\u00e9rieur hors du contr\u00f4le du testateur. Il n'est pas facile de voir comment les mots \"par cas fortuit\" pourraient s'appliquer au mot \"perdus\". Sans doute, ainsi que je l'ai dit plus haut, il y a des cas o\u00f9 la perte est due \u00e0 un cas fortuit et peut \u00eatre v\u00e9rifi\u00e9e, mais l'id\u00e9e m\u00eame que comporte le mot \"perdus\" implique un cas qui ne peut \u00eatre expliqu\u00e9. L'on sait que l'\u00e9crit existait; l'on ne se rappelle plus o\u00f9 on l'a plac\u00e9; l'on ne peut plus le retrouver. De toute fa\u00e7on, il est perdu, mais l'on ne saurait dire qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 perdu \"par cas fortuit.\" En fait, l'on ignore absolument comment il a \u00e9t\u00e9 perdu. C'est sans doute un \"cas impr\u00e9vu\", ainsi qu'y pourvoit le sous-paragraphe 6 de l'article 1233, mais ce n'est pas un \"cas fortuit\", ainsi que le d\u00e9finit le Code Civil lui-m\u00eame au sous-paragraphe 24 de l'article 17. Cette d\u00e9finition est certainement loin d'\u00eatre satisfaisante, parce que, t\u00e2cher de faire comprendre le \"cas fortuit\" en l'accolant \u00e0 la notion de force majeure, n'aide gu\u00e8re, surtout si l'on consid\u00e8re qu'\u00e0 travers tout le Code le \"cas fortuit\" et la force majeure sont pour ainsi dire assimil\u00e9s dans leurs effets. Mais, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, si la minute ou l'original d'un testament ont \u00e9t\u00e9 perdus dans les conditions pr\u00e9vues par l'article 860 (1), et, c'est-\u00e0-dire, de fa\u00e7on qu'ils ne puissent pas \u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, c'est l'article 1233 (6) qui pourvoit \u00e0 la preuve testimoniale, pourvu que le testateur n'ait pas connu le fait de leur perte.\nIci, \u00e0 mon humble avis, l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9tabli toutes les circonstances qui pouvaient justifier l'admission de la preuve testimoniale et je partage l'opinion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance qui a conclu \u00e0 cette admissibilit\u00e9.\nSur cette question, je ne vois pas comment on peut s'en rapporter \u00e0 la jurisprudence ou \u00e0 la doctrine fran\u00e7aise. L'article 860 du Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e9dicte les conditions d'admissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve testimoniale en les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant des mots: \"Lorsque la minute ou l'original d'un testament ont \u00e9t\u00e9 perdus ou d\u00e9truits par cas fortuit.\" Et, d'autre part, l'article 1233 (6) parle des \"cas o\u00f9 la preuve \u00e9crite a \u00e9t\u00e9 perdue par cas impr\u00e9vu.\"\nIl en est autrement du seul article correspondant du Code Napol\u00e9on (1348) qui est exprim\u00e9 comme suit: \"Au cas o\u00f9 le cr\u00e9ancier a perdu le titre qui lui servait de preuve litt\u00e9rale par suite de cas fortuit, impr\u00e9vu, r\u00e9sultant d'une force majeure.\"\nOn ne saurait interpr\u00e9ter un article qui exige \"un cas fortuit, impr\u00e9vu, r\u00e9sultant d'une force majeure\" de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que l'article 1233 (6) qui ne parle que du \"cas impr\u00e9vu.\" Ici, le cas fortuit et la force majeure sont \u00e9limin\u00e9s, et, en plus, l'article fran\u00e7ais exige m\u00eame, pour le cas impr\u00e9vu, qu'il r\u00e9sulte d'une force majeure.\nLe m\u00eame raisonnement s'impose \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'article 860 qui n'a pas de texte correspondant dans le Code Napol\u00e9on et qui, pour l'admissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve testimoniale, exige que la minute ou l'original d'un testament aient \u00e9t\u00e9 \"perdus ou d\u00e9truits par cas fortuit.\"\nAu surplus, l'article 1348 du Code Napol\u00e9on parle seulement du cr\u00e9ancier qui a perdu le titre qui lui servait de preuve litt\u00e9rale et, dans ce cas \u00e9videmment, la doctrine qui \u00e9carte la preuve testimoniale, \u00e0 raison de la n\u00e9gligence que comporterait de la part du cr\u00e9ancier la perte de son titre, ne saurait s'appliquer \u00e0 un l\u00e9gataire qui n'a jamais eu le testament en sa possession. Si, comme le supposent certains auteurs, le fait de la perte d'un document doit \u00eatre imput\u00e9 \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence de celui qui le d\u00e9tenait, cela ne peut jamais s'appliquer \u00e0 un l\u00e9gataire. Ce raisonnement ne vaudrait qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du testateur ou d'un tiers qui aurait eu le document en sa possession et, d\u00e8s lors, l'argument bas\u00e9 sur la n\u00e9gligence ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 contre le l\u00e9gataire.\nTout cela est bien soulign\u00e9 par la Cour de R\u00e9vision, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, dans le jugement de Filiatrault v. Feeny 19. Au cours de ce jugement, l'on fait remarquer que les expressions du Code Napol\u00e9on d\u00e9notent une s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 beaucoup plus grande dans la latitude donn\u00e9e aux parties de prouver la perte d'un document et son contenu. Dans cette affaire, les parties avaient conclu un contrat devant notaire. La loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec exige que le notaire conserve avec grande pr\u00e9caution un document qu'il re\u00e7oit; mais, par quelque circonstance inexpliqu\u00e9e, la minute ou l'original du document avait disparu sans la faute des parties. Le notaire prouva qu'il avait fait des recherches diligentes et continues pour retrouver l'original et qu'il ne pouvait pas le trouver; il ne pouvait que constater sa disparition.\nLa Cour de R\u00e9vision commen\u00e7a par citer Greenleaf, On Evidence, p. 558:\nIf the instrument is lost, the party is required to give some evidence that such a paper existed, though slight evidence is sufficient for this purpose, and that a bona fide and diligent search has been unsuccessfully made for it in the place where it was most likely to be found; after which his own affidavit is admissible to the fact of its loss. It must be recollected that the object of the proof is merely to establish a reasonable presumption of the loss of the instrument, and that this is a preliminary inquiry addressed to the discretion of the judge \u2026 Satisfactory proof being thus made of the loss of the instrument, the party will be admitted to give secondary evidence of its contents.\nEn pareil cas et appliquant l'autorit\u00e9 ainsi cit\u00e9e, la Cour d\u00e9cida que, dans les circonstances, \"this constitutes a 'cas impr\u00e9vu', or unforeseen accident sufficient to justify secondary proof.\" En l'esp\u00e8ce, ce jugement confirmait celui de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Plus tard, en 1926, l'honorable juge Albert de Lorimier, dans l'affaire de Ren\u00e9 v. Mallette 20, d\u00e9cida que \"la preuve de l'existence et subs\u00e9quemment de la suppression ou de la perte d'un testament olographe ne doit pas n\u00e9cessairement se faire d'une fa\u00e7on directe, mais elle peut r\u00e9sulter d'un ensemble de pr\u00e9somptions graves, pr\u00e9cises et concordantes.\"\nEt il est tr\u00e8s important de noter que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, en plus d'avoir admis la preuve testimoniale, a appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 cette preuve dans le sens que l'existence du testament olographe \u00e9tait prouv\u00e9e et qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e9galement prouv\u00e9 que ce dernier testament contenait la r\u00e9vocation du premier.\nSur ce point, la Cour du Banc du Roi 21 ne s'est pas prononc\u00e9e parce qu'elle a trouv\u00e9 que les autres motifs de mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le testament du 22 avril \u00e9taient suffisants.\nMais, il est \u00e9galement important de remarquer que l'article 860 C.C. parle du testament initial, alors que sur la question de r\u00e9vocation, le Code Civil contient toute une s\u00e9rie d'articles qui s'y appliquent sp\u00e9cialement. Ce sont les articles 892 et suivants.\nOr, un testament, et, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, celui du 22 avril, pouvait \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 par le testateur \"par un testament post\u00e9rieur qui le r\u00e9voque express\u00e9ment ou par la nature de ses dispositions.\" C'est l\u00e0 le premier paragraphe de l'article 892 C.C.\nL'on peut \u00e9galement citer le deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de cet article, en vertu duquel un testament peut \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 \"par un acte devant notaire ou autre acte par \u00e9crit, par lequel le changement de volont\u00e9 est express\u00e9ment constat\u00e9.\"\nIl s'ensuit que du moment qu'il est admis, comme l'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le juge de premi\u00e8re instance (et il avait dans la preuve toute la justification n\u00e9cessaire pour appuyer cette d\u00e9cision), que le testament olographe du 29 avril a exist\u00e9 et que son contenu \u00e9tait prouv\u00e9, \u00e0 savoir, qu'il contenait une r\u00e9vocation du testament en la forme d\u00e9riv\u00e9e de la Loi d'Angleterre, du 22 avril 1947, l'on a donc ici soit, suivant les exigences du premier paragraphe, un testament post\u00e9rieur qui a r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 express\u00e9ment le testament du 22 avril, soit au moins un acte par \u00e9crit par lequel le changement de volont\u00e9 de Langlais a \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment constat\u00e9. Que l'on choisisse l'un ou l'autre cas, la r\u00e9vocation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\nEt c'est l\u00e0 suivant moi, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a erron\u00e9ment interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la loi en d\u00e9cidant que la destruction du testament olographe, qu'il a pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e simplement parce que ce testament n'avait pas pu \u00eatre retrouv\u00e9 et produit, constitue, de la part de Langlais, l'intention de faire revivre le premier testament en date du 22 avril 1947. C'est l\u00e0 exactement le contraire de ce qui est pourvu aux articles 895 et 896 du Code Civil \u00e0 l'effet que \"la r\u00e9vocation faite dans un testament post\u00e9rieur conserve tout son effet, quoique ce nouvel acte reste sans ex\u00e9cution par l'incapacit\u00e9 du l\u00e9gataire ou son refus de recueillir.\" A quoi l'article 896 ajoute: \"A d\u00e9faut de disposition expresse, c'est par les circonstances et les indices de l'intention du testateur qu'il est d\u00e9cid\u00e9 si la r\u00e9vocation du testament qui en r\u00e9voque un autre, est destin\u00e9e \u00e0 faire revivre le testament ant\u00e9rieur.\"\nLe jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, apr\u00e8s avoir pris pour acquis que si on n'avait pu retrouver le testament olographe du 29 avril, il \u00e9tait \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer que le testateur l'avait d\u00e9truit (une pr\u00e9somption qui ne r\u00e9sulte nullement des circonstances et des indices que l'on peut d\u00e9duire de la preuve), prenant cette d\u00e9duction pour acquise, en a conclu que le testateur avait voulu faire rena\u00eetre le premier testament. Telle n'est pas la loi.\nQue l'on envisage le testament olographe du 29 avril comme un testament post\u00e9rieur qui r\u00e9voquait express\u00e9ment le testament du 22 avril (fait qui est d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance), ou qu'on l'envisage comme \"un autre acte par \u00e9crit par lequel le changement de volont\u00e9 est express\u00e9ment constat\u00e9\", dans l'une comme dans l'autre hypoth\u00e8se la r\u00e9vocation, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans un testament post\u00e9rieur, a conserv\u00e9 tout son effet (C.C. 895).\nLa r\u00e9vocation n'e\u00fbt pu \u00eatre nulle que si elle eut \u00e9t\u00e9 \"contenue dans un testament nul par d\u00e9faut de forme.\"\nIci, il n'est nullement pr\u00e9tendu que le testament olographe du 29 avril \u00e9tait nul par d\u00e9faut de forme. Il n'y a, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, ni all\u00e9gation ni preuve. Mais, en plus, \u00e0 supposer que le testament olographe du 29 avril ne puisse \u00eatre maintenu comme testament, il resterait qu'il constitue au moins \"un acte par \u00e9crit par lequel le changement de volont\u00e9 est express\u00e9ment constat\u00e9\" de la part du testateur, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 2 de l'article 892 C.C. La r\u00e9vocation contenue dans cet acte par \u00e9crit aurait pour effet d'annuler le testament du 22 avril, vu qu'il n'est pas \u00e9tabli de disposition expresse qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 destin\u00e9e \u00e0 faire revivre ce testament ant\u00e9rieur. Au surplus, on ne saurait trouver dans le dossier des circonstances ou des indices de l'intention du testateur de faire revivre le testament ant\u00e9rieur, si m\u00eame l'on admet qu'il a d\u00e9truit le testament olographe du 29 avril.\nBien respectueusement, c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de cette situation dont le juge de premi\u00e8re instance ne para\u00eet pas s'\u00eatre avis\u00e9.\nTout d'abord, il n'avait aucune justification pour pr\u00e9sumer de la destruction du testament du 29 avril par le seul fait que ce testament ne pouvait pas \u00eatre retrouv\u00e9. Et, m\u00eame si cette destruction devait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e, il ne s'ensuit pas, d'apr\u00e8s les articles 895 et 896 C.C. que, par cette pr\u00e9tendue destruction, Langlais avait l'intention de faire revivre le testament en la forme d\u00e9riv\u00e9e de la Loi d'Angleterre du 22 avril.\nVoil\u00e0 pour la question l\u00e9gale. Si cela \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire, j'ajouterais que les circonstances et les indices que l'on peut d\u00e9duire de la preuve \u00e9tablissent, au contraire, que Langlais n'a jamais eu l'intention de faire revivre son premier testament.\nCe que je viens de dire me para\u00eet suffisant pour arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que l'appelante ne saurait r\u00e9ussir et il devient donc inutile d'examiner les autres moyens soulev\u00e9s en cette cause.\nMais, depuis que j'ai \u00e9crit les notes qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, j'ai eu l'avantage de prendre connaissance de celles de mon coll\u00e8gue, le juge Fauteux, et je dois dire que je concours enti\u00e8rement avec l'opinion qu'il exprime quant \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 que l'on doit accorder au testament du 22 avril 1947, et dans lesquelles il accepte, en substance, l'avis de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en appel) sur l'efficacit\u00e9 de ce premier testament. Cependant, il m'incombe de choisir entre les deux alternatives qui se pr\u00e9sentent et d\u00e9cider si l'intim\u00e9e doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme l\u00e9gataire, en vertu du testament du 29 avril 1947 (le second), ou comme h\u00e9riti\u00e8re, \u00e0 la suite du jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en appel) qui s'est content\u00e9 de d\u00e9clarer que le testament du 22 avril (le premier) devait \u00eatre mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9. Ce choix est n\u00e9cessaire pour permettre \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de savoir si elle doit faire v\u00e9rifier le second testament ou s'il sera suffisant qu'elle produise une d\u00e9claration d'h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9.\nComme c'est \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re alternative que s'est ralli\u00e9 le jugement dont est appel, ainsi que la majorit\u00e9 des juges de notre Cour; et comme il ne s'agit, en somme, que de d\u00e9terminer en vertu de quelle proc\u00e9dure l'intim\u00e9e pourra prendre possession des biens de la succession de son p\u00e8re, je crois que pour toutes fins pratiques je devrais adopter le r\u00e9sultat auquel en est venue la majorit\u00e9 de mes coll\u00e8gues, et je d\u00e9clare donc qu'elle doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme venant aux biens de son p\u00e8re en sa qualit\u00e9 d'h\u00e9riti\u00e8re en vertu de la loi. C'est d'ailleurs l'unique conclusion de la d\u00e9claration en cette cause. Dans les circonstances, j'adopte, sur la disposition du pr\u00e9sent appel, les conclusions exprim\u00e9es dans les raisons de M. le juge Fauteux.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nKerwin J.: For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Fauteux, I agree that when the deceased affixed his signature to the document dated April 22, 1947, he did not realize that he was signing a will and, furthermore, that his mind and will did not accompany the physical act of execution. If there were nothing more in the case, that would be sufficient to dismiss the appeal but it is alleged that, in any event it has been legally proved, on April 29 the deceased executed a holograph will revoking the document of April 22 and bequeathing everything he owned to the respondent and that therefore it should be declared that the respondent took under that will.\nFor all that appears in the record the testator may have destroyed the holograph will, either with the intention, which was never carried out, of making a new will, or without such intention. Under Article 892 of the Quebec Civil Code a will may be revoked:\u2014\n2) By means of a notarial or other written act by which the change of intention is expressly stated.\nIf the document of April 29 be taken merely as an \"act\" and not a will, then Article 860 has no application as it refers only to wills. We must then refer to Article 1233 (6) in the 3rd Title \"Of Obligation\", Sec. III \"Of Testimony\":\u2014\n1233. Proof may be made by testimony: \u2026\n6. In cases in which the proof in writing has been lost by unforeseen accident, or is in the possession of the adverse party or of a third person without collusion of the party claiming, and cannot be produced.\nThere is no proof that the writing has been lost by unforeseen accident because despite the testimony as to the searches that were made for the holograph will, there is, as stated above, nothing to show that the testator did not destroy it.\nIf, on the other hand, the document be taken as a will, Article 860 would apply:\u2014\nIf the will have been destroyed or lost before the death of the testator, without the fact ever having come to his knowledge, it may be proved in the same manner as if the accident had occurred after his death.\nAgain there is no evidence that the will was destroyed or lost without the fact coming to the knowledge of the testator. On each of these points therefore, I agree with the reasons of Mr. Justice Taschereau.\nI should add that I am unable to obtain any assistance in the construction of the relevant articles of the code from the reports of the codifying Commissioners because I find it impossible to say what part of any article was taken from French sources and what part from English sources. On this point I think the statement of Sir Montague Smith, speaking for the Judicial Committee in Symes v. Cuvillier 22 is appropriate to the present appeal:\u2014\nThis authority (i.e. the reports of the Commissioners) is no doubt entitled to respect; but the opinion of the Commissioners has not the weight of a judicial opinion pronounced after discussion and argument.\nIn accordance with the dispositif of the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal, the respondent is therefore the sole legal heiress of Joseph Alfred Firmin Langlais and the appeal should be disposed of as proposed by Mr. Justice Fauteux.\nTaschereau J. (dissenting) : Il s'agit dans la pr\u00e9sente cause d'un appel d'un jugement rendu par la Cour du Banc du Roi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec 23, renversant le jugement de l'honorable Juge Gibsone. Le montant en litige est d'environ $100,000.00 et nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s'il doit \u00eatre attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelante, Marie-Anna Langlais, s\u0153ur du de cujus, Alfred Firmin Langlais, ou \u00e0 sa fille El\u00e9anora G\u00e9raldine Langlais, qui est intim\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente cause.\nFirmin Langlais, le testateur, est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 Beauport, pr\u00e8s de Qu\u00e9bec, le 29 novembre 1948, \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 82 ans et trois mois. Il avait pass\u00e9 une grande partie de sa vie \u00e0 Lancaster, Pennsylvanie, mais revenait de temps en temps \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, o\u00f9 il se retirait chez sa soeur madame Thivierge. Il \u00e9tait veuf depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, et durant cette m\u00eame p\u00e9riode de trente-cinq ans, il n'a jamais revu sa fille l'intim\u00e9e, sauf lorsqu'il est revenu \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, en avril 1947, pour assister aux fun\u00e9railles de sa s\u0153ur madame Thivierge. L'intim\u00e9e en effet \u00e9tait partie \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 16 ans pour New York, o\u00f9 elle passa plusieurs ann\u00e9es, et ensuite se rendit \u00e0 Toronto, o\u00f9 elle \u00e9pousa un monsieur Phillips maintenant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, et avec qui elle eut un fils qui, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de l'instruction de la cause, \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de 25 ans. En novembre 1943, madame Phillips ainsi que son fils, par jugement de la Cour de Comt\u00e9 d'Ontario, firent changer leur nom en celui de Langley.\nMadame Thivierge, s\u0153ur de Firmin Langlais, est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec le 14 avril 1947, laissant une succession \u00e9valu\u00e9e \u00e0 $250,000.00. Par son testament re\u00e7u devant les notaires Jos. Sirois et Laurent Lesage, elle nomma M. F. St-Pierre de Montr\u00e9al, ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, et Marie-Anna Langlais et Firmin Langlais, ses s\u0153ur et fr\u00e8re, l\u00e9gataires universels par parts \u00e9gales. Apr\u00e8s paiement des legs particuliers et des dons de charit\u00e9, chaque l\u00e9gataire touchait environ $100,000.00. Avant d'h\u00e9riter ainsi, Firmin Langlais ne poss\u00e9dait rien, et il semble que ses voyages \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec \u00e9taient pay\u00e9s par madame Thivierge. Firmin Langlais vint de Lancaster pour assister aux fun\u00e9railles de sa soeur \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, et l'intim\u00e9e, qui n'avait pas vu ses tantes madame Thivierge et Marie-Anna Langlais, ni son p\u00e8re depuis trente-cinq ans, vint \u00e9galement de Toronto. Durant quelque temps, M. Langlais habita la maison de sa s\u0153ur dont il avait h\u00e9rit\u00e9, et plus tard il demeura \u00e0 l'Hospice Du Fargy \u00e0 Beauport, refuge pour les vieillards, o\u00f9 il mourut le 28 novembre 1948. Par son testament fait le 22 avril 1947, d'apr\u00e8s le mode d\u00e9riv\u00e9 de la loi d'Angleterre, il nommait le mis-en-cause, M. G\u00e9rard Bornais, ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, et l'appelante, Marie-Anna Langlais, s\u0153ur du de cujus, \u00e9tait l\u00e9gataire universelle.\nDans son action institu\u00e9e devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, l'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que ce testament est nul, parce qu'il n'est pas rev\u00eatu des formes pr\u00e9vues par la loi, parce que le testateur n'\u00e9tait pas compos mentis au moment o\u00f9 il l'a sign\u00e9, ou qu'\u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement il l'aurait sign\u00e9 sous l'empire de l'erreur, croyant ex\u00e9cuter un autre document. \u00c9videmment, si ce testament est nul, l'intim\u00e9e, unique fille du testateur, h\u00e9rite de la totalit\u00e9 de la succession par suite des dispositions de l'article 625 C.C. Mais l'intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue subsidiairement que si le testament du 22 avril 1947 est valide, elle h\u00e9rite tout de m\u00eame de son p\u00e8re, en vertu d'un second testament olographe, fait le 29 avril 1947, l'instituant l\u00e9gataire universelle, et r\u00e9voquant le premier. Ce testament d'apr\u00e8s elle, et que quelques t\u00e9moins ont vu, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 perdu, et elle a tent\u00e9 d'en faire la preuve secondaire.\nL'honorable Juge Gibsone a rejet\u00e9 ces pr\u00e9tentions. Il en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que toutes les formalit\u00e9s requises pour la validit\u00e9 du premier testament ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies, que Langlais connaissait la nature de l'acte juridique qu'il avait pos\u00e9 le 22 avril 1947, et qu'il y a lieu de pr\u00e9sumer qu'il a d\u00e9truit le second, rendant caduque la r\u00e9vocation qui y \u00e9tait contenue. La Cour d'Appel 24 a renvers\u00e9 ce jugement. Elle en est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la conclusion que le testateur \u00e9tait sain d'esprit, mais qu'il a sign\u00e9 le premier testament sous le coup d'une double \u00e9motion caus\u00e9e \u00e0 la fois par la mort tr\u00e8s r\u00e9cente de sa s\u0153ur, et par le fait d'avoir revu sa fille, la demanderesse, apr\u00e8s trente-cinq ans de s\u00e9paration. La Cour est d'opinion que Langlais ne se serait pas rendu compte qu'il aurait sign\u00e9 un testament, mais qu'il aurait cru signer un autre document, et que par cons\u00e9quent, ce qu'il a sign\u00e9 n'a pas re\u00e7u l'adh\u00e9sion libre d'une volont\u00e9 \u00e9clair\u00e9e. En arrivant \u00e0 cette conclusion, la Cour d'Appel \u00e9videmment n'a pas eu \u00e0 se prononcer sur la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la preuve offerte pour l'admissibilit\u00e9 du second testament, car en annulant le premier, elle instituait l'intim\u00e9e h\u00e9riti\u00e8re ab intestat.\nIl importe en premier lieu de se demander si le premier testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 rev\u00eatu des formes que la loi requiert. L'article concernant les formalit\u00e9s dont doivent \u00eatre entour\u00e9s les testaments faits suivant la forme d\u00e9riv\u00e9e de la Loi d'Angleterre, est le suivant:\u2014\n851. Le testament suivant la forme d\u00e9riv\u00e9e de la loi d'Angleterre (soit qu'il affecte les biens meubles ou les immeubles) doit \u00eatre r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par \u00e9crit et sign\u00e9, \u00e0 la fin, de son nom ou de sa marque par le testateur, ou par une autre personne pour lui en sa pr\u00e9sence et d'apr\u00e8s sa direction expresse (laquelle signature est alors ou ensuite reconnue par le testateur comme appos\u00e9e \u00e0 son testament alors produit, devant au moins deux t\u00e9moins idoines pr\u00e9sents en m\u00eame temps et qui attestent et signent de suite le testament en pr\u00e9sence et \u00e0 la requisition du testateur.)\n(Les r\u00e8gles qui concernent la capacit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins sont les m\u00eames que pour le testament en forme authentique.)\nIl n'y a pas de doute que ces formalit\u00e9s sont imp\u00e9ratives. L'article 855 ne pr\u00eate \u00e0 aucune confusion:\u2014\n855. Les formalit\u00e9s auxquelles les testaments sont assujettis par les dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente section doivent \u00eatre observ\u00e9es \u00e0 peine de nullit\u00e9, \u00e0 moins d'une exception \u00e0 ce sujet.\nCes formalit\u00e9s ont-elles \u00e9t\u00e9 suivies? Le Mis-en-cause G\u00e9rard Bornais a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le testament, et le soir du 22 avril, il est venu chez le testateur et lui en a donn\u00e9 lecture, en pr\u00e9sence des deux t\u00e9moins sp\u00e9cialement requis, garde Ouellet et M. Ren\u00e9 Lachance, comptable. Imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s, en pr\u00e9sence des deux t\u00e9moins, le testateur qui venait d'affirmer que le tout \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 ses d\u00e9sirs, signa son testament, et garde Ouellet et M. Lachance y appos\u00e8rent ensuite leur signature. C'est la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9e que deux formalit\u00e9s essentielles n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suivies. En premier lieu, le testateur n'aurait pas reconnu le testament ni sa signature comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 appos\u00e9e en pr\u00e9sence des deux t\u00e9moins; et deuxi\u00e8mement, le testateur n'aurait pas personnellement requis les t\u00e9moins d'attester et de signer le testament. Je ne crois pas que ces deux objections soient fond\u00e9es.\nPour les maintenir, il faudrait que cette Cour mette de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le jugement rendu en 1921 dans Wynne v. Wynne 25. Dans cette cause, le testateur instituait sa femme sa l\u00e9gataire universelle dans un testament fait suivant la forme d\u00e9riv\u00e9e de la loi d'Angleterre. Quand le testament lui fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, il le signa sans parler \u00e0 aucun des deux t\u00e9moins pr\u00e9sents, et n'a pas reconnu sa signature comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 appos\u00e9e par lui, et il n'y eut pas de demande formelle aux t\u00e9moins de signer. Le testament a cependant \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu valide. La Cour en est venue \u00e0 la conclusion que comme les deux t\u00e9moins avaient vu le testateur signer, il \u00e9tait inutile que ce dernier reconnaisse de nouveau sa signature. De plus, comme l'explique M. le Juge Mignault, aucun mandat expr\u00e8s n'est requis pour obtenir la pr\u00e9sence des t\u00e9moins. Si quelqu'un les fait venir \u00e0 sa connaissance, comme dans le cas qui nous occupe, les prescriptions de la loi sont remplies. Dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, d'apr\u00e8s la preuve, il appert que les deux t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 requis par Bornais de signer en pr\u00e9sence de Langlais qui a donn\u00e9 sa compl\u00e8te adh\u00e9sion.\nLa cause de Gingras v. Gingras 26 est bien diff\u00e9rente. Il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'un testament fait suivant la forme d\u00e9riv\u00e9e de la loi d'Angleterre. L'article 851 exige que la signature du testament soit reconnue par le testateur comme appos\u00e9e \u00e0 son testament, et cette connaissance doit avoir lieu devant au moins deux t\u00e9moins comp\u00e9tents, qui sont pr\u00e9sents en m\u00eame temps, et qui signent ensuite en pr\u00e9sence et \u00e0 la r\u00e9quisition du testateur. Gingras avait sign\u00e9 en premier son testament devant un t\u00e9moin, et plus tard, un second t\u00e9moin qui n'avait jamais vu Gingras signer, y apposa sa signature. Il est clair que tel n'est pas le cas qui se pr\u00e9sente dans la cause sous consid\u00e9ration. Je suis donc d'avis que les formalit\u00e9s requises ont \u00e9t\u00e9 suivies, et que ce premier point soulev\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nEn second lieu, quelle \u00e9tait la capacit\u00e9 mentale du testateur? \"Tout majeur sain d'esprit et capable d'ali\u00e9ner ses biens, peut en disposer librement par testament\", dit l'article 831 C.C. Il est d'abord important de noter que dans son t\u00e9moignage, le mis-en-cause M. G\u00e9rard Bornais, avocat de Qu\u00e9bec, nous raconte dans quelles circonstances ce testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Il nous dit d'abord qu'il connaissait tr\u00e8s bien Marie-Anna Langlais parce qu'il y a au del\u00e0 de 25 ans, elle lui avait avanc\u00e9 l'argent n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la poursuite de ses \u00e9tudes, et que depuis ce temps, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 en relation assez \u00e9troite avec la famille, et qu'il a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 heureux, en reconnaissance de ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9, de rendre \u00e0 mademoiselle Langlais tous les services qu'elle lui demandait. Il allait de temps en temps prendre le d\u00eener, et \u00e0 la mort de madame Thivierge, dont le testament nommait Firmin Langlais et Marie-Anna Langlais l\u00e9gataires universels, ces derniers lui ont demand\u00e9 de les repr\u00e9senter pour le r\u00e8glement de la succession. Tous deux ont sign\u00e9 une procuration en faveur de M. Bornais, mais dont il n'avait pas encore eu l'occasion de se servir \u00e0 la date de l'instruction de la cause.\nComme Bornais parlait un soir avec Firmin Langlais de la succession de madame Thivierge, Langlais, qui venait d'h\u00e9riter d'un substantiel montant quelques jours auparavant, dit \u00e0 Bornais qu'il n'avait pas fait de testament. Bornais a alors sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Langlais de voir le notaire Sirois qui, depuis longtemps, \u00e9tait le notaire de la famille Langlais, mais Langlais a refus\u00e9, et a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Bornais s'il \u00e9tait capable de lui en r\u00e9diger un. Bornais a expliqu\u00e9 alors qu'il y avait trois sortes de testaments, et on semble avoir convenu d'adopter celui qui serait fait suivant la forme d\u00e9riv\u00e9e de la loi d'Angleterre. Sur une question de Bornais, Langlais a exprim\u00e9 le d\u00e9sir qu'il voulait laisser tous ses biens \u00e0 sa soeur Marie-Anna Langlais, et que Bornais, d\u00e9j\u00e0 porteur d'une procuration pour le r\u00e8glement de la succession de madame Thivierge, soit ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire. Bornais est alors reparti, a consult\u00e9 les notaires Turgeon et Labrecque sur la r\u00e9daction du testament, et est revenu vers huit heures le soir du 22 avril \u00e0 la maison de madame Thivierge o\u00f9 Langlais demeurait. L\u00e0, dans le salon, en pr\u00e9sence du testateur, de Marie-Anna Langlais, l'appelante, et deux t\u00e9moins sp\u00e9cialement requis, garde Blandine Ouellet qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 au service de madame Thivierge pendant douze ans, et un M. Lachance qui \u00e9tait venu aider \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer son rapport d'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. Bornais a lu le testament. Langlais a sign\u00e9 le premier, et ensuite les deux t\u00e9moins. Avant et apr\u00e8s la lecture du testament, toujours en pr\u00e9sence des t\u00e9moins, mais avant que les signatures ne soient appos\u00e9es, les explications les plus claires, les plus pr\u00e9cises, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es \u00e0 Langlais. Je laisse de c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour le moment les t\u00e9moignages de Bornais qui a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 le testament, et celui de l'appelante qui est b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, pour rappeler seulement ceux de deux t\u00e9moins ind\u00e9pendants, garde Ouellet et Ren\u00e9 Lachance. La premi\u00e8re explique que lorsque les t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus dans la chambre, M. Bornais leur a dit: \"M. Langlais vient de faire son testament, si vous voulez signer comme t\u00e9moins.\" Il a ajout\u00e9: \"Je vais vous le lire.\" \"M. Bornais s'est lev\u00e9, il a lu le testament, bien distinctement \u00e0 haute voix; quand il eut fini de le lire, il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Langlais s'il voulait signer; il s'est retourn\u00e9 vers moi, il m'a demand\u00e9 de signer; puis il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Ren\u00e9 Lachance s'il voulait signer.\"\nRen\u00e9 Lachance, l'autre t\u00e9moin, est encore plus sp\u00e9cifique. Il dit que Bornais a expliqu\u00e9 que Langlais l'avait requis de pr\u00e9parer un testament, et a demand\u00e9 aux deux t\u00e9moins s'ils avaient objection \u00e0 signer en cette qualit\u00e9. Bornais a alors dit \u00e0 Langlais: \"Un testament \u00e7a ne fait pas mourir\" \"c'est une pr\u00e9caution.\" Puis il a ajout\u00e9: \"Vous allez \u00e9couter attentivement, je vais lire votre testament.\" En pr\u00e9sence de tout le monde, Bornais a alors lu le testament, et a dit en s'adressant \u00e0 Langlais: \"S'il y avait quelque chose; si \u00e7a rencontrait ses d\u00e9sirs, ses id\u00e9es, si c'\u00e9tait bien ce qu'il voulait;\" et enfin que \"ceci ne l'obligeait en rien, et que s'il voulait faire un autre testament, qu'il \u00e9tait parfaitement libre d'annuler celui-l\u00e0, et d'en faire un autre en n'importe quel temps.\" Toujours d'apr\u00e8s Lachance, Langlais aurait dit que c'\u00e9tait \"all right.\"\nBornais confirme ces t\u00e9moignages. Voici ce qu'il dit: \"J'ai dit que monsieur Langlais m'avait demand\u00e9 de pr\u00e9parer un projet de testament, qu'il donnait ses biens \u00e0 mademoiselle Langlais, que je l'avais pr\u00e9par\u00e9;\u2014j'ai dit: \"Il va falloir deux t\u00e9moins. Si vous n'avez pas d'objection \u00e0 l'\u00eatre, je vais lire le testament.\" On n'est pas oblig\u00e9 de le lire; l\u00e0, j'ai lu le testament. J'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 monieur Langlais si c'\u00e9tait bien ses volont\u00e9s, s'il y avait autre chose \u00e0 ajouter; il m'a dit: \"non.\" J'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 monsieur Langlais s'il voulait mettre sa signature au bas du testament; ensuite, j'ai lu la formule, \u00e0 gauche, aux t\u00e9moins, les t\u00e9moins ont appos\u00e9 leur signature eux autres m\u00eames.\"\nQuand les t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 partis, Bornais est rest\u00e9 seul avec Langlais pour quelques instants, et Langlais a confi\u00e9 \u00e0 Bornais la garde de son testament. Apr\u00e8s, ils sont all\u00e9s dans la salle \u00e0 d\u00eener o\u00f9 un verre de vin a \u00e9t\u00e9 offert. Langlais s'est inform\u00e9 de la famille de Bornais, de ses enfants, et a parl\u00e9 de ses projets d'avenir, durant une demi-heure ou trois quarts d'heure.\nLanglais savait-il \u00e0 ce moment qu'il faisait un testament? Je n'en puis douter un seul instant, et je crois qu'il comprenait parfaitement la port\u00e9e de l'acte juridique qu'il posait. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que Firmin Langlais, malgr\u00e9 son \u00e2ge quelque peu avanc\u00e9, avait la jouissance compl\u00e8te de ses facult\u00e9s intellectuelles, et qu'il savait \u00e0 la date du 22 avril 1947, qu'il disposait de ses biens en faveur de sa soeur Marie-Anna Langlais.\nEn premier lieu, Marie-Anna Langlais nous dit que son fr\u00e8re \u00e9tait bien lucide; et d'apr\u00e8s Bornais, Langlais \u00e9tait \"un gar\u00e7on d'affaire, un gar\u00e7on intelligent.\" Le docteur Georges-Henri Larue, psychiatre de Qu\u00e9bec, appel\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de M. Langlais vers la fin du mois d'avril 1947, avant qu'il n'entreprenne un voyage \u00e0 Lancaster dans la Pennsylvanie, jure que Langlais lui paraissait en \u00e9tat de s'occuper de ses affaires, et que sa m\u00e9moire semblait bien fid\u00e8le au moment o\u00f9 il l'a vu. \"Il n'a pas pu mettre en \u00e9vidence des signes d'affaiblissement intellectuel.\" Le Docteur dit: \"Il a r\u00e9pondu tr\u00e8s bien aux questions,\" et \u00e0 la question qui lui est demand\u00e9e si lui, le Docteur Larue, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 justifiable de donner un certificat recommandant l'interdiction de Langlais, il r\u00e9pond dans la n\u00e9gative. Il dit enfin: \"Au point de vue d'affaiblissement intellectuel, de baisse de jugement, de l'orientation, j'ai constat\u00e9 absolument rien.\"\nLe Docteur Gustave Ferland, m\u00e9decin de Beauport, a soign\u00e9 Langlais alors que celui-ci \u00e9tait \u00e0 la maison de pension de Du Fargy dans le cours de l'ann\u00e9e 1948, et a constat\u00e9 que M. Langlais \u00e9tait un individu \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s normal pour son \u00e2ge au point de vue mental. Le Docteur Reid, m\u00e9decin de madame Thivierge pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, a rencontr\u00e9 Langlais \u00e0 maintes reprises depuis 1926, mais c'est surtout en 1947 qu'il l'a vu. Il causait avec lui tr\u00e8s souvent et t\u00e9moigne que Langlais r\u00e9pondait bien aux questions, qu'il causait bien. Il a vu Langlais au moment de la mort de madame Thivierge, soit le ou vers le 15 avril 1947, quelques jours avant qu'il ne signe son testament. \"Il r\u00e9pondait bien\u2014dit-il\u2014souvent avec beaucoup d'esprit, d'\u00e0 propos.\" Il jure ceci: \"Je n'ai pas trouv\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait un homme ali\u00e9n\u00e9 du tout, il savait ce qu'il voulait, et le faisait. Quelquefois, il avait de petites absences de m\u00e9moire, mais il m'a fait l'effet d'un homme qui pouvait suivre une id\u00e9e, y penser longtemps, et revenir le lendemain sur la m\u00eame chose.\"\nLanglais voyait personnellement \u00e0 ses affaires de banque, vaquait \u00e0 ses propres occupations. Il se promenait souvent en automobile, et le chauffeur qui le conduisait affirme qu'il parlait tr\u00e8s bien. Vers la fin d'avril 1947, quelques jours apr\u00e8s avoir fait le testament en question, il s'est rendu en automobile \u00e0 Lancaster avec Bornais, le Docteur Reid et le fils de ce dernier, pour y chercher les effets qu'il y avait laiss\u00e9s. Malgr\u00e9 qu'il f\u00fbt un peu soup\u00e7onneux du Docteur Reid, rien ne d\u00e9montre aucune faiblesse intellectuelle qui puisse laisser croire qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas en possession de toutes ses facult\u00e9s. Quelque temps plus tard, il s'est m\u00eame rendu jusqu'aux Trois-Pistoles en automobile, en compagnie de quelques amis.\nSi j'ai relat\u00e9 ces faits, peut-\u00eatre trop longuement, ce n'est pas tant pour \u00e9tablir la sanit\u00e9 d'esprit de Langlais, que reconnaissent d'ailleurs et la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour d'Appel, que pour d\u00e9montrer que je ne puis admettre, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 toutes ces circonstances, la possibilit\u00e9 qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 induit en erreur, et qu'il ait cru en signant ce testament, signer un document qui n'\u00e9tait pas l'expression de ses derni\u00e8res volont\u00e9s. L'\u00e9motion caus\u00e9e par la mort de sa soeur et par le retour de sa fille El\u00e9anora, aurait tellement embrouill\u00e9 et obscurci son esprit, dit-on, qu'il aurait perdu la facult\u00e9 de discernement et toute sa libert\u00e9 d'action. Quatre faits sont invoqu\u00e9s au soutien de cette pr\u00e9tention. Garde Ouellet raconte en effet qu'environ vingt minutes apr\u00e8s qu'il eut sign\u00e9 son testament, Langlais est mont\u00e9 dans sa chambre, et elle lui a dit: \"Savez-vous ce que vous venez de signer M. Langlais?\" Sur sa r\u00e9ponse affirmative, la garde a dit: \"Qu'est-ce que c'est?\" Il a r\u00e9pondu: \"C'est des formules pour Ti-Noir.\" Ti-Noir \u00e9tait un surnom donn\u00e9 \u00e0 madame Thivierge. La garde a alors dit : \"C'est votre testament que vous venez de signer.\" La garde ajoute qu'il a fait quelques pas en arri\u00e8re, et qu'il s'est mis \u00e0 rire, et est parti. Le second incident se serait produit le 29 avril 1947, au presbyt\u00e8re St-Roch, sept jours apr\u00e8s qu'il e\u00fbt fait son testament. En cette occasion, il aurait, \u00e0 la suggestion de l'abb\u00e9 Brochu, d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire un testament olographe, et aurait affirm\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas de testament. Au bureau du notaire Lavery Sirois en automne 1947, ce dernier lui a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de faire un testament, et Langlais n'a pas r\u00e9pondu. Et lors d'une seconde visite, plus tard, en octobre 1948, il a dit qu'il avait un testament, \"et que ses biens allaient \u00e0 sa fille madame Phillips.\" Enfin, il aurait dit \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e dans le cours du mois d'ao\u00fbt 1947, \"on m'a jou\u00e9 un sale tour, on m'a fait signer quelque chose, et moi je pensais que c'\u00e9tait pour des billets et de l'argent am\u00e9ricain pour aller \u00e0 Lancaster;\" et il aurait ajout\u00e9 : \"Apr\u00e8s cela, j'ai fait un autre testament, o\u00f9 j'ai r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 cette esp\u00e8ce de papier; je t'ai mise dans le chemin une fois, je ne veux pas le faire deux fois.\"\nAvec respect, je ne vois rien dans ces d\u00e9clarations qui ait la force probante voulue, pour me permettre de conclure que Langlais n'a pas volontairement et librement sign\u00e9 son testament. Le testament est un acte solonnel de libre disposition de ses biens pour prendre effet \u00e0 cause de mort. C'est le privil\u00e8ge inviolable du testateur de choisir ses h\u00e9ritiers, de leur donner la totalit\u00e9 ou partie de ses biens, et c'est aussi son droit de modifier ou r\u00e9voquer \u00e0 volont\u00e9 ses dispositions testamentaires. Toutes sortes de raisons, que seul le testateur conna\u00eet, dont il est le juge unique, peuvent l'induire \u00e0 agir dans un sens ou dans l'autre. Il n'est pas tenu de rien r\u00e9v\u00e9ler \u00e0 personne; c'est un secret qu'il garde pour lui.\nIl est assez facile, je pense, d'expliquer ces r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es \u00e0 garde Ouellet, \u00e0 l'abb\u00e9 Brochu, au notaire Sirois et \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, et de les concilier avec la signature librement appos\u00e9e \u00e0 son testament. La preuve d\u00e9montre qu'apr\u00e8s avoir h\u00e9rit\u00e9 d'une somme de $100,000.00 de sa soeur madame Thivierge, Langlais qui jusqu'\u00e0 l\u00e0 \u00e9tait sans le sou, est devenu m\u00e9fiant, que quand on lui parlait d'argent, il d\u00e9tournait la conversation, qu'il n'aimait pas qu'on le questionne sur ses affaires personnelles, et garde Ouellet dit aussi que vis-\u00e0-vis elle, il ne montrait pas de dispositions bienveillantes et que parfois, \"il \u00e9tait plus ou moins poli envers elle.\" Ce sentiment qui animait Langlais \u00e0 ne pas parler de questions financi\u00e8res personnelles, de la disposition qu'il avait faite de ses biens, se rencontre chez bien des hommes qui, avec raison, veulent garder ces choses pour eux, et craignent souvent en les r\u00e9v\u00e9lant, de provoquer des conflits familiaux toujours d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ables.\nEst-il surprenant que Langlais ait dit \u00e0 garde Ouellet d'une fa\u00e7on polie, de se m\u00ealer de ses affaires, et qu'il soit parti en souriant, imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s, sans continuer la conversation? Peut-on le bl\u00e2mer de ne pas avoir r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 \u00e0 l'abb\u00e9 Brochu l'existence d'un testament ant\u00e9rieur, dans lequel il donnait tout \u00e0 sa soeur et rien \u00e0 sa fille, et faire na\u00eetre ainsi des discussions auxquelles il ne tenait pas? Son refus en automne 1947, de r\u00e9pondre au notaire Sirois, qui lui demande s'il a un testament, alors qu'il en a deux, confirme bien l'existence de cette r\u00e9pugnance qu'il professe \u00e0 parler de ces choses personnelles. Ce qu'il a dit \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e est une simple tentative de cacher le fait qu'il l'avait un jour d\u00e9sh\u00e9rit\u00e9e. Toutes ces contradictions sont autant d'excuses qu'il cherche pour voiler l'acte qu'il a pos\u00e9 et qu'il regrette. Dans les circonstances difficiles o\u00f9 il se trouvait, on s'explique ais\u00e9ment cette absence de logique. Qu'il n'ait pas dit la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, que d'ailleurs il n'\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9 de dire, qu'il ait eu des r\u00e9ticences qu'il avait le droit d'avoir, ceci ne signifie nullement que quand il a sign\u00e9 son premier testament, alors qu'il \u00e9tait sain d'esprit de l'aveu de tous, l'\u00e9motion, dont personne alors ne s'est aper\u00e7u, avait tellement obscurci son intelligence et affaibli sa volont\u00e9, qu'il croyait signer un document qui n'\u00e9tait pas son testament. Il aurait fallu qu'il f\u00fbt en proie \u00e0 une \u00e9motion bien vive et bien profonde pour qu'il ne r\u00e9alis\u00e2t pas ce qu'il faisait, quand il demande lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 Bornais le 19 avril de lui pr\u00e9parer un testament, quand il le signe trois jours plus tard devant quatre personnes pr\u00e9sentes, apr\u00e8s que les explications les plus compl\u00e8tes lui sont fournies, au cours desquelles le mot \"testament\" revient \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, et quand l'on sait qu'apr\u00e8s avoir sign\u00e9, il confie la garde du document \u00e0 Bornais, en lui disant: \"Vous pouvez le garder.\" Encore, si ce document eut comport\u00e9 quelque difficult\u00e9, mais il \u00e9tait d'une simplicit\u00e9, d'une clart\u00e9 qu'un enfant eut pu comprendre sans effort. Comme l'a dit le Juge Idington dans la cause de Wynne v. Wynne (supra) \u00e0 la page 78:\u2014\nMoreover there was such a simplicity in the words used in question herein that all that which needed to be understood by him signing was so susceptible of comprehension at the slightest glance that, if any consciousness at all were left, they must have been understood by any one capable of executing the document as undoubtedly the deceased was.\nDans la cause de Craig v. Lamoureux 27, le Conseil Priv\u00e9 a confirm\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 d'un testament, dans des circonstances beaucoup plus douteuses que celles qui se pr\u00e9sentent dans la cause actuelle. Je crois donc que le testament du 22 avril 1947 a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par Langlais avec plein consentement de sa volont\u00e9, et qu'il doit \u00eatre tenu pour valide, comme l'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le juge au proc\u00e8s. Il faut des raisons bien graves pour mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 les derni\u00e8res volont\u00e9s d'un testateur.\nLanglais entretenait des relations cordiales avec sa s\u0153ur Marie-Anna. Celle-ci, apr\u00e8s la mort de madame Thivierge, \u00e9tait sa seule s\u0153ur, et sa plus proche parente, \u00e0 part sa fille El\u00e9anora, l'intim\u00e9e, qui avait quitt\u00e9 sa famille, et n'avait pas revu son p\u00e8re depuis au del\u00e0 de trente-cinq ans. Il ne me para\u00eet pas \u00e9tonnant que lors de l'ouverture du testament de madame Thivierge, le 15 avril 1947, Langlais subitement devenu riche, et \u00e2g\u00e9 de 80, eut song\u00e9 \u00e0 faire son testament, et \u00e0 instituer Marie-Anna Langlais, son unique h\u00e9riti\u00e8re. L'intim\u00e9e ne voyait ni madame Thivierge, ni Marie-Anna Langlais, ni son p\u00e8re. Dans les r\u00e9unions de famille on n'en parlait jamais, et m\u00eame Bornais, le mis-en-cause, ami des Langlais depuis vingt-cinq ans, ignorait son existence.\nMais, apr\u00e8s la mort de madame Thivierge, au retour de l'intim\u00e9e, venue \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec pour assister aux fun\u00e9railles, il ne fait pas de doute que Langlais commence \u00e0 entretenir pour sa fille des sentiments diff\u00e9rents. D'abord, \u00e0 la veille des fun\u00e9railles, il la voit quelques minutes dans le salon mortuaire, et plus tard, une seconde fois au d\u00e9but de mai, \u00e0 l'H\u00f4tel St-Roch, o\u00f9 elle se retirait. Pouss\u00e9 par un sentiment d'affection paternelle, il se r\u00e9concillie avec elle, et apr\u00e8s avoir fait un premier testament, le 22 avril, instituant l'appelante sa l\u00e9gataire universelle, alors qu'on lui dit \"qu'un testament peut toujours \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9\", il se ravise, et avant de partir pour Lancaster, il demande conseil \u00e0 l'abb\u00e9 Brochu. Le 29 avril, en pr\u00e9sence de ce dernier, il \u00e9crit et signe un testament olographe qui, d'apr\u00e8s l'abb\u00e9 Brochu, se lisait substantiellement ainsi:\u2014\nJe r\u00e9voque tous autres testaments que l'on aurait pu jusqu'ici me faire signer dans un moment de fatigue ou de lassitude et je l\u00e8gue tous les biens que je d\u00e9laisserai \u00e0 mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s, \u00e0 ma fille El\u00e9anora Langlais.\nIl est impossible de douter de l'existence de ce second testament dont la garde a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9e \u00e0 l'abb\u00e9 Brochu, qui l'a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans un coffret de s\u00fbret\u00e9, au presbyt\u00e8re de St-Roch, jusqu'en juin 1948. D'ailleurs, en mai 1947, l'abb\u00e9 Brochu, en pr\u00e9sence du testateur, en a donn\u00e9 lecture \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e. Plus tard, Langlais a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs personnes qui le rapportent, qu'apr\u00e8s sa mort, tous ses biens iraient \u00e0 sa fille. Dans le mois de janvier 1948, il lui donne $25,000.00 et en mars de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, $5,000.00, soit un total de $30,000.00. L'intim\u00e9e lui en demande davantage, mais Langlais dit qu'elle n'aurait plus rien. Dans le cours du mois de juin 1948, Langlais va au presbyt\u00e8re, reprend son testament disant \u00e0 l'abb\u00e9 Brochu qu'il voulait y apporter des modifications, et \u00e0 la fin de septembre 1948, apr\u00e8s avoir affirm\u00e9 au notaire Sirois qu'il avait un testament, il lui dit qu'il reviendrait le voir pour le faire modifier. Le notaire Sirois n'a jamais revu Langlais subs\u00e9quemment, et apr\u00e8s cette date, personne ne sait ce qu'est advenu du testament. Apr\u00e8s la mort de Langlais en novembre 1948, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9.\nC'est la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9e qu'elle peut en faire la preuve secondaire. La loi permet en certains cas, de faire la preuve orale de documents perdus ou d\u00e9truits, et cette r\u00e8gle s'applique en France et dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Les textes varient cependant quelque peu. En France, le seul article qui puisse autoriser cette preuve secondaire est l'article 1348, paragraphe (4) du Code Napol\u00e9on. Il se lit ainsi:\u2014\nArt. 1348. Elles re\u00e7oivent encore exception toutes les fois qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 possible au cr\u00e9ancier de se procurer une preuve litt\u00e9rale de l'obligation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e envers lui.\nCette seconde exception s'applique:\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n4\u00b0. Au cas o\u00f9 le cr\u00e9ancier a perdu le titre qui lui servait de preuve litt\u00e9rale, par suite d'un cas fortuit, impr\u00e9vu et r\u00e9sultant d'une force majeure. Il est admis par la jurisprudence et les auteurs fran\u00e7ais que cet article est applicable aux testaments aussi bien qu'\u00e0 tout autre titre. (Vide Demolombe, Vol. 21, page 29; Laurent, Vol. 13, page 112; Dalloz, Nouveau Code Civil annot\u00e9, Vol. 3, art. 1348, No. 191).\nL'on voit \u00e0 la lecture de ce paragraphe (4), que ce n'est pas dans tous les cas que l'on peut faire l\u00e9galement la preuve du contenu d'un testament perdu. Il faut que le testament ait \u00e9t\u00e9 perdu, par suite d'un cas fortuit, impr\u00e9vu et r\u00e9sultant d'une force majeure. Il n'est pas suffisant que celui qui r\u00e9clame un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice en vertu d'un pr\u00e9tendu testament, dise qu'il est perdu, que des recherches ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, et qu'il demeure introuvable. Ce serait mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 les termes pr\u00e9cis de l'article 1348. Les auteurs sont tous unanimes, et en France aujourd'hui pour qu'il soit permis de faire la preuve orale d'un testament perdu, il faut prouver l'existence de l'acte, le fait, ind\u00e9pendant de la volont\u00e9 du testateur, et ignor\u00e9 de lui, qui en a caus\u00e9 la destruction, la teneur du testament et sa date pr\u00e9cise. (Dalloz, Nouveau R\u00e9pertoire, Vol. 4, verbo \"Testaments\", page 499).\nVoici ce que disait Pothier (Oeuvres de Pothier, Ed. Bugnet, page 435):\u2014\nSi celui qui demande \u00e0 \u00eatre re\u00e7u \u00e0 la preuve testimoniale, all\u00e8gue seulement qu'il a perdu ses titres, sans qu'il y ait aucun fait de force majeure constat\u00e9, par lequel il les ait perdus, il ne peut \u00eatre re\u00e7u \u00e0 la preuve testimoniale que ces titres ont exist\u00e9; autrement l'ordonnance, qui d\u00e9fend la preuve par t\u00e9moins, pour pr\u00e9venir la subornation des t\u00e9moins, deviendrait illusoire; car il ne serait pas plus difficile \u00e0 quelqu'un qui voudrait faire la preuve par t\u00e9moins de quelque pr\u00eat ou de quelque paiement qu'il n'aurait pas fait, de suborner des t\u00e9moins, qui diraient qu'ils ont vu entre ses mains des obligations ou des quittances, comme d'en suborner qui diraient qu'ils ont vu compter l'argent.\nDemolombe s'exprime dans le m\u00eame sens (Vol. 30, No 201) :\u2014\nil faut que le demandeur fournisse la preuve: 1\u00b0 du cas fortuit qu'il all\u00e8gue; 2\u00b0 de l'existence ant\u00e9rieure du titre instrumentaire de la convention ou du fait juridique contest\u00e9, et de la perte de ce titre par suite du cas fortuit; 3\u00b0 de la convention elle-m\u00eame ou du fait juridique sur lequel il fonde sa demande.\nEt le m\u00eame auteur (Vol. 21, page 29, Donations entre vifs et Testaments) dit:\u2014\nCe que l'on demande \u00e0 prouver en effet ce n'est pas un testament verbal; tout au contraire! C'est un testament \u00e9crit qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait avec toute la solennit\u00e9 prescrite; et l'article 1348 C.C. ne fait que consacrer cette r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de bon sens et d'\u00e9quit\u00e9. Seulement, bien entendu, il faudra, dans ce cas, prouver d'abord l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement pr\u00e9cis et d\u00e9termin\u00e9 de force majeure, par suite duquel le testament aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truit.\nEt ensuite, il faudra prouver non seulement que le testament a exist\u00e9 et quel en \u00e9tait le contenu, mais encore qu'il a exist\u00e9 avec toute \" la solennit\u00e9 requise et que des t\u00e9moins, suffisamment en \u00e9tat d'appr\u00e9cier sa r\u00e9gularit\u00e9, l'ont vu et lu sans y remarquer aucun vice.\nLaurent est aussi explicite: (Droit Civil, Vol. 13, page 112):\u2014\nSi nous admettons avec la Cour de Cassation que l'article 1348, No. 4, est applicable aux actes de derni\u00e8re volont\u00e9, c'est qu'il ne fait qu'appliquer un principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de droit; on peut et on doit l'\u00e9tendre par analogie \u00e0 la perte d'un testament. La loi donne sa sanction aux actes juridiques qui se font en vertu de ces dispositions; c'est un principe \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire. Or le testateur, on le suppose, a fait un testament dans les formes voulues par la loi; donc sa volont\u00e9 doit recevoir son ex\u00e9cution. On oppose au l\u00e9gataire qu'il ne produit par le testament; il r\u00e9pond en prouvant que le testament a exist\u00e9 et qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truit par un \u00e9v\u00e9nement de force majeure.\nAubry et Rau (Droit Civil, Vol. 7, 4\u00e8me Ed., page 10) expriment les vues suivantes:\u2014\nBien que le testament soit un acte solennel, rien n'emp\u00eache qu'en cas de perte d'un testament par suite d'un \u00e9v\u00e9nement rest\u00e9 inconnu au testateur, ou de sa suppression par un autre individu que ce dernier, les personnes au profit desquelles il renfermait des dispositions, ne puissent en poursuivre l'ex\u00e9cution, ou r\u00e9clamer, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, en prouvant, d'une part, le fait de la suppression du testament ou de sa perte par suite d'un accident de force majeure, d'autre part, le contenu de cet acte, et m\u00eame, en principe, sa compl\u00e8te r\u00e9gularit\u00e9.\nBaudry-Lacantinerie partagent les m\u00eames vues (Droit Civil, Vol. 2, 4\u00e8me Ed., page 375):\u2014\nM\u00eame si un testament r\u00e9gulier dans la forme a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truit par cas fortuit, la preuve de l'existence du testament, de son contenu et de sa r\u00e9gularit\u00e9, pourra \u00eatre faite par t\u00e9moins.\nDalloz (Code Annot\u00e9, Nouveau Code Civil, Vol. 3, sous-article 1348, No. 191) :\u2014\n191.\u2014L'article 1348, No. 4, qui admet la preuve testimoniale de l'existence de titres perdus ou d\u00e9truits par cas fortuit ou de force majeure, est applicable au testament aussi bien qu'\u00e0 tout autre titre.\n192.\u2014D\u00e8s lors, celui qui se pr\u00e9vaut de dispositions de derni\u00e8re volont\u00e9 faites en sa faveur dans un testament qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truit par cas fortuit ou de force majeure, est recevable \u00e0 \u00e9tablir par t\u00e9moins l'existence du testament, sa teneur, sa validit\u00e9 et le fait accidentel par suite duquel sa destruction est survenue.\nEnfin, Planiol et Ripert (Droit Civil, Vol. 5, page 544) \u00e9crivent:\u2014\nLes dispositions derni\u00e8res d'une personne d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e peuvent cependant \u00eatre prouv\u00e9es par t\u00e9moins lorsque le testament a exist\u00e9 et qu'il a p\u00e9ri fortuitement. Cette solution ne contrarie en rien l'exigence de la loi relativement \u00e0 l'emploi de l'\u00e9criture pour la confection d'un testament. Le pr\u00e9tendu l\u00e9gataire doit prouver l'existence d'un testament, son contenu, sa destruction par cas fortuit ou fait d'un tiers, l'ignorance de ce fait par le testateur, et la persistance de la volont\u00e9 du testateur.\nDans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, sur ce point, deux articles doivent retenir notre attention. Ce sont 860 et 1233 (6) C.C. Ils se lisent ainsi:\u2014\n860. Lorsque la minute ou l'original d'un testament ont \u00e9t\u00e9 perdus ou d\u00e9truits par cas fortuit, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du testateur, ou sont d\u00e9tenus sans collusion par la partie adverse ou par un tiers, la preuve de ce testament peut \u00eatre faite en la mani\u00e8re r\u00e9gl\u00e9e pour le cas quant aux autres actes et \u00e9crits au titre Des obligations.\nSi le testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truit ou perdu avant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du testateur et qu'il n'ait pas connu le fait, la preuve peut \u00e9galement s'en faire comme si l'accident n'\u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nSi le testateur a connu la destruction ou la perte du testament et s'il n'y a pas suppl\u00e9\u00e9, il est cens\u00e9 l'avoir r\u00e9voqu\u00e9, \u00e0 moins d'une manifestation post\u00e9rieure de la volont\u00e9 d'en maintenir les dispositions.\n1233. La preuve testimoniale est admise:\n6. Dans les cas o\u00f9 la preuve \u00e9crite a \u00e9t\u00e9 perdue par cas impr\u00e9vu, ou se trouve en la possession de la partie adverse, ou d'un tiers, sans collusion de la part de la partie r\u00e9clamante, et ne peut \u00eatre produite.\nL'article 860 qui traite de la preuve secondaire des testaments perdus ou d\u00e9truits, ne correspond \u00e0 aucun article du Code Napol\u00e9on. En France, pour les fins de preuve secondaire, on place les testaments et les autres \u00e9crits sur un pied d'\u00e9galit\u00e9, tandis qu'ici, on semble exiger davantage pour \u00e9tablir l'existence d'un testament perdu, que pour prouver tout autre \u00e9crit. En effet, lorsqu'il s'agit de testaments, le Code parle de \"perdus ou d\u00e9truits par cas fortuit\", et il se contente de \"cas impr\u00e9vu\" pour les autres documents. C'est en s'appuyant sur cette distinction que l'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que l'article 860 C.C. ne s'applique qu'\u00e0 la v\u00e9rification des testaments, et que lorsque l'on veut, au cours d'une instance judiciaire, faire la preuve secondaire d'un testament perdu, il faut avoir recours \u00e0 l'article 1233 (6). On trouve la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9tention dans Mignault (Vol. 4, page 315) et dans Langelier (Vol. 3, page 145). Les deux auteurs affirment le contraire, et signalent que pour la v\u00e9rification des testaments, c'est l'article 861 C.C. qui trouve son application, et que pour la preuve secondaire d'un testament au cours d'un proc\u00e8s, c'est 860 C.C. qui s'applique. C'est aussi ce que disent les codificateurs dans leur cinqui\u00e8me rapport, article 116, page 178. S'il faut donc \u00eatre guid\u00e9 par l'article 860 C.C., il faut que celui qui invoque le testament, dont il veut \u00e9tablir la preuve secondaire, d\u00e9montre qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 perdu ou d\u00e9truit par \"cas fortuit\", tel que l'exige l'article. Et c'est sur celui qui all\u00e8gue ce cas fortuit que repose le fardeau de le prouver. (C.C. art. 1200; Deschenes v. C.P.R. 28; Lemieux v. Ruel 29). Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 l'argument que les mots \"cas fortuit\" ne s'appliquent qu'\u00e0 la destruction du testament, et non \u00e0 sa perte, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, la preuve secondaire doit \u00eatre admise, parce qu'en prouvant qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9, il doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 perdu. Je ne puis admettre cette pr\u00e9tention, et je croix que les mots \"cas fortuit\" se rapportent et \u00e0 la perte ou \u00e0 la destruction du testament. Cette distinction n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 faite nulle part, et si l'on r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 l'article 892 C.C, l'on verra que l\u00e0 le Code interpose les mots et parle \"de la destruction ou de la perte par cas fortuit.\" J'\u00e9prouve de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 voir pourquoi les mots \"cas fortuit\" ne s'appliqueraient qu'\u00e0 la destruction du testament dans l'article 860 C.C, et seulement \u00e0 sa perte dans l'article 892 C.C. Je ne m'explique pas davantage pourquoi le l\u00e9gislateur exigerait, en vertu de l'article 1233 (6), la preuve \"de la perte par cas impr\u00e9vu\", lorsqu'il s'agit d'un document ordinaire, et simplement la preuve de la \"perte\" lorsqu'il s'agit d'un testament qui pourtant est un acte solennel.\nEn droit anglais la r\u00e8gle est moins s\u00e9v\u00e8re. Elle est exprim\u00e9e ainsi dans Greenleaf \"On Evidence\", (15\u00e8me Ed., Vol. 1, section 558) :\u2014\nIf the instrument is lost, the party is required to give some evidence that such a paper once existed though slight evidence is sufficient for this purpose, and that a bona fide and diligent search has been unsuccessfully made for it in the place where it was most likely to be found, if the nature of the case admits such proof; after which, his own affidavit is admissible to the fact of its loss. The same rule prevails where the instrument is destroyed. What degree of diligence for the search is necessary it is not easy to define, as each case depends much on its peculiar circumstances; and the question, whether the loss of the instrument is sufficiently proved to admit secondary evidence of its contents, is to be determined by the Court and not by the jury. But it seems that, in general, the party is expected to show that he 'has in good faith exhausted, in a reasonable degree, all the sources of information and means of discovery which the nature of the case would naturally suggest and which were accessible to him. Chez-nous c'est pratiquement la r\u00e8gle du droit fran\u00e7ais qui s'applique, et celui qui pr\u00e9tend qu'un testament est perdu ou d\u00e9truit, doit \u00e9tablir non seulement qu'il a fait les recherches raisonnables pour le trouver, mais le fait pr\u00e9cis comme cons\u00e9quence duquel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fortuitement perdu ou d\u00e9truit. C'est alors seulement qu'il pourra en faire la preuve secondaire. Discutant les dispositions du paragraphe 6 de l'article 1233 du Code Civil, qui pourtant para\u00eet moins s\u00e9v\u00e8re que l'article 860 C.C., la Cour de Revision qui avait \u00e0 juger de l'admissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve orale d'un contrat, a cependant d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans Masson v. Fournier 30 que:\u2014\nLa partie qui exerce un recours fond\u00e9 sur un acte sous seing priv\u00e9 est tenue de le produire avec exploit d'assignation. Elle n'est pas admise \u00e0 en faire la preuve testimoniale sur sa simple d\u00e9claration qu'elle l'a perdu. Pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier du paragraphe 6 de l'article 1233 C.C. il faut \u00e9tablir, non seulement l'existence du titre perdu, mais encore le cas impr\u00e9vu qui a caus\u00e9 sa perte.\nQu'est-il arriv\u00e9 du second testament de Langlais? Nous n'en savons rien. L'intim\u00e9e s'est content\u00e9e de d\u00e9montrer qu'elle ne peut pas le produire, et qu'elle a fait des recherches pour le trouver. Sans vouloir entrer dans le champ des hypoth\u00e8ses et des sp\u00e9culations, il est permis de penser que le testateur a pu le d\u00e9truire d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment avec intention de le r\u00e9voquer; qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truit par cas fortuit avec sa connaissance, sans qu'il y ait suppl\u00e9\u00e9, ce qui \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 r\u00e9vocation (C.C. 892) ; qu'il l'ait perdu, et que le sachant, il n'en a pas fait d'autre (C.C. 860). Autant de possibilit\u00e9s qui sont du domaine de l'imagination. Mais dans tout le dossier il n'y a rien qui puisse nous mettre m\u00eame sur un piste \u00e9loign\u00e9e, d'un fait pr\u00e9cis de perte ou de destruction par cas fortuit. (Demolombe, 30, p. 194, n\u00b0 201; Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, 9, vo. Preuve, p. 465, No. 1261 et autorit\u00e9s; Idem, Jurisprudence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Nouveau C.C, 3, sous art. 1348, p. 513, No. 192; Idem, 2, p. 565, No. 120 et autorit\u00e9s; Juris-Classeur Civil art. 1348, No. 84 et s. et autorit\u00e9s; Larombi\u00e8re, 6 p. 579, No. 40, p. 582, No. 42; Bienvenue & al. v. Lacaille 31; Desruisseaux v. Poulin 32).\nAucune pr\u00e9somption de droit ou de faits ne peut nous aider \u00e0 arriver \u00e0 une conclusion. On ne peut pas plus supposer la destruction ou la perte du testament par cas fortuit, sa destruction par un tiers avec ou sans la connaissance du testateur, la perte par ce dernier du document contenant l'expression de ses derni\u00e8res volont\u00e9s, ou sa destruction volontaire avec intention de r\u00e9vocation. Les conjectures ne sont pas permises, et il faut un fait pr\u00e9cis, prouv\u00e9, qui permette la preuve secondaire. En droit anglais, Jarman \"On Wills\" enseigne que si un testament n'est pas retrouv\u00e9 \u00e0 la mort du testateur, et qu'il \u00e9tait en possession de ce dernier, il existe une pr\u00e9somption qu'il l'a d\u00e9truit avec intention de le r\u00e9voquer, mais je ne crois pas que cette pr\u00e9somption soit reconnue dans le droit de Qu\u00e9bec.\nLa seule pr\u00e9somption admise dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec n'est pas une pr\u00e9somption de \"destruction volontaire\" du testament, quand il ne peut \u00eatre retrac\u00e9. La pr\u00e9somption qui existe est que la \"destruction\" une fois prouv\u00e9e, doit \u00eatre attribu\u00e9e au testateur s'il \u00e9tait en possession, ou \u00e0 un tiers, si c'est ce dernier qui avait la garde du testament. Mais, la destruction, la lac\u00e9ration ou la rature, doivent \u00eatre pr\u00e9alablement \u00e9tablies, et c'est ensuite seulement que joue la pr\u00e9somption pour aider \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer qui en est l'auteur. (Mignault, Vol. 4, page 420; Langelier, Vol. 3, page 190; Planiol, Vol. 3, 4\u00e8me \u00e9dition, page 665; Colin et Capitant, Vol. 3, 2\u00e8me \u00e9dition, page 904). Rien de tel ne se rencontre dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le seulement qu'on ne sait pas ce qui est advenu de ce testament.\nDans ces conditions, je suis d'opinion que ce second testament ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme l\u00e9galement prouv\u00e9, et qu'il ne contient pas l'expression des derni\u00e8res volont\u00e9s de Langlais. Le r\u00f4le des tribunaux n'est pas de sanctionner un testament nuncupatif, cette forme orale de tester autrefois reconnue chez les Romains de l'antiquit\u00e9.\nMais, pr\u00e9tend encore l'intim\u00e9e, si ce testament n'est pas l\u00e9galement prouv\u00e9, et si on doit le mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 comme tel, il contient toujours une clause de r\u00e9vocation qui subsiste (C.C. 892(2)) et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e suivant les dispositions de 1233(6) C.C. Le premier testament serait alors r\u00e9voqu\u00e9, et comme nous serions vis-\u00e0-vis une succession ab intestat, l'intim\u00e9e serait la seule h\u00e9riti\u00e8re. Pour admettre cette pr\u00e9tention, il faudrait conc\u00e9der que le testament est divisible, et que l'h\u00e9ritier qui ne peut l\u00e9galement le prouver, peut tout de m\u00eame en retenir une partie qui r\u00e9voquerait un testament ant\u00e9rieur. La doctrine ne permet pas une semblable division. Le testateur en effet n'a pas fait deux dispositions diff\u00e9rentes, un testament nouveau, et une r\u00e9vocation qui puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e s\u00e9par\u00e9ment.\nLe Code Napol\u00e9on n'a pas d'article correspondant au second paragraphe de notre article 895 C.C. Cependant, les auteurs sont tous d'opinion que la r\u00e9vocation contenue dans un testament nul par d\u00e9faut de forme est nulle. Demolombe (Vol. 22, No. 155, page 123, Donations entre vifs) dit ce qui suit:\u2014\nIl n'y a pas dans ce testament deux parties distinctes et ind\u00e9pendantes l'une de l'autre; il n'y a qu'un tout indivisible. Le testateur n'a pas fait deux sortes de dispositions diff\u00e9rentes, savoir: 1\u00b0. Un testament nouveau; 2\u00b0. une r\u00e9vocation qui puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e s\u00e9par\u00e9ment per se comme formant aussi l'objet principal de l'acte. L'objet orincipal de l'acte, ou plut\u00f4t son unique objet, c'est un testament nouveau renfermant des dispositions nouvelles. Et la clause de r\u00e9vocation n'en est qu'une de d\u00e9pendance accessoire, clause le plus souvent banale et de style, qui s'y trouve intimement subordonn\u00e9e.\nEt par suite, en droit, il est impossible d'appliquer ici la maxime: utile per inutile non vitiatur; car cette maxime est applicable qu'autant que les diverses clauses du m\u00eame acte n'ont entre elles de liaison intime et que l'une n'est pas la condition ou m\u00eame seulement la cons\u00e9quence de l'autre. C'est qu'en effet on ne pourrait pas scinder cet acte unique sans s'exposer \u00e0 m\u00e9conna\u00eetre l'intention du testateur, qui n'a pas fait une r\u00e9vocation pure et simple, mais qui, voulant seulement remplacer un testament ant\u00e9rieur par un autre testament, a pu subordonner la r\u00e9vocation du premier \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 du second.\nExpliquant l'article 1037 C.N. qui valide la r\u00e9vocation faite dans un testament post\u00e9rieur rest\u00e9 sans ex\u00e9cution par l'incapacit\u00e9 de l'h\u00e9ritier ou par son refus de recueillir, Demolombe ajoute: (page 125):\nQuant \u00e0 l'argument, que l'on a d\u00e9ruit de l'article 1037, il suffit, pour y r\u00e9pondre, de remarquer que la diff\u00e9rence, qui en r\u00e9sulte, a toujours exist\u00e9! En Droit romain, et dans notre ancien Droit fran\u00e7ais, la r\u00e9vocation d'un testament ant\u00e9rieur, par un testament post\u00e9rieur valable, avait son effet, lors m\u00eame que ce dernier testament demeurait sans ex\u00e9cution par l'incapacit\u00e9 ou le refus de l'h\u00e9ritier institu\u00e9 ou du l\u00e9gataire; tandis que la r\u00e9vocation ne r\u00e9sultait pas d'un testament nul en la forme (comp. les 2 et 7, Inst. Quib. mod. testam, infirm.; Ricard, loc. supra; Furgole, chap. IX, n\u00b0 40) ; c'est que, en effet, l'inex\u00e9cution du testament post\u00e9rieur valable ne lui enl\u00e8ve pas sa force probante; \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence du testament nul, qui, n'existant pas aux yeux de la loi, ne saurait prouver ni les dispositions nouvelles, ni la r\u00e9vocation!\nLaurent, \"Principes de Droit Civil\", Vol. 14, No. 188, \u00e0 la page 202, exprime la m\u00eame opinion:\u2014\nOn ne peut donc pas diviser la volont\u00e9 et dire: le testateur est cens\u00e9 n'avoir pas voulu tester, puisque le testament est nul, mais il est cens\u00e9 avoir voulu r\u00e9voquer, puisque l'acte r\u00e9vocatoire est valable. Il faut dire: le testateur a voulu tout ensemble tester et r\u00e9voquer, l'acte par lequel il a manifest\u00e9 sa volont\u00e9 est nul, donc il est cens\u00e9 n'avoir rien voulu, ni tester ni r\u00e9voquer. Ce que nous disons de la volont\u00e9 s'applique naturellement \u00e0 l'\u00e9crit, qui est l'expression de la volont\u00e9. Si la volont\u00e9 est indivisible, l'\u00e9crit l'est aussi.\nAubry et Rau, \"Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais\", Vol. 11, page 511, s'expriment ainsi:\u2014\nLa clause de r\u00e9vocation n'est valable qu'autant que l'acte qui la contient r\u00e9unit les formes particuli\u00e8res que cet acte requiert d'apr\u00e8s sa nature. Il en r\u00e9sulte que, si un acte dress\u00e9 en la forme des testaments par acte public contenait, non seulement r\u00e9vocation de dispositions ant\u00e9rieures, mais encore des dispositions nouvelles, la nullit\u00e9 de cet acte pour vice de forme par exemple, pour incapacit\u00e9 de l'un des t\u00e9moins, entra\u00eenerait la nullit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9vocation, tout aussi bien que celle des dispositions nouvelles; et cela, quand bien m\u00eame cet acte r\u00e9unirait d'ailleurs toutes les formalit\u00e9s exig\u00e9es pour les actes notari\u00e9s.\nIl est vrai que ces expressions d'opinion se rapportent aux cas de testaments nuls pour d\u00e9faut de forme, mais l'on voit pour les raisons donn\u00e9es que la r\u00e8gle qui r\u00e9git ces cas doit \u00e9galement s'appliquer \u00e0 une clause de r\u00e9vocation dans un testament dont l'existence n'est pas l\u00e9galement prouv\u00e9e. Qu'il s'agisse en effet d'un testament nul pour d\u00e9faut de forme, ou d'un testament qui n'est pas l\u00e9galement prouv\u00e9, le principe est le m\u00eame; et vu que ni l'un ni l'autre de ces documents n'a de force probante, la clause de r\u00e9vocation ne peut avoir d'effets. Il en est diff\u00e9remment ici comme en France, de la r\u00e9vocation d'un testament faite dans un testament post\u00e9rieur qui reste sans ex\u00e9cution, par suite de l'incapacit\u00e9 du l\u00e9gataire, ou son refus de recueillir (895 C.C.). Dans ce dernier cas, le testament est valide et par cons\u00e9quent la clause de r\u00e9vocation aussi, et la succession \u00e9choit \u00e0 un autre. Il faut donc conclure que si une clause de r\u00e9vocation dans un testament nul pour d\u00e9faut de forme est nulle, il s'ensuit logiquement, et par analogie, qu'une clause de r\u00e9vocation dans un testament non prouv\u00e9 est \u00e9galement nulle. Les deux testaments sont inexistants.\nJe suis donc d'opinion que ce second pr\u00e9tendu testament de Langlais est indivisible, et que s'il est vrai que l'on peut r\u00e9voquer un testament par un testament post\u00e9rieur, ou par un autre acte par \u00e9crit par lequel le changement de volont\u00e9 est express\u00e9ment constat\u00e9, il est \u00e9galement vrai, comme dans le cas qui nous occupe, qu'un testament post\u00e9rieur qui contient une r\u00e9vocation et de nouvelles dispositions, ne peut pas \u00eatre divis\u00e9, et que si la disposition n'est pas prouv\u00e9e, \u00e0 cause de la nullit\u00e9 de la forme de l'acte ou de l'absence de preuve l\u00e9gale, la r\u00e9vocation qui est l'accessoire tombe \u00e9galement. Qui en effet peut dire que le testateur aurait r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 le premier testament, s'il n'avait pas eu en vue de faire de nouvelles dispositions testamentaires?\nAdmettre le principe qu'un testament puisse ainsi \u00eatre divis\u00e9 serait enlever tout sens \u00e0 l'article 895 C.C. qui veut que la r\u00e9vocation contenue dans un testament nul pour d\u00e9faut de forme est nulle. Il serait \u00e9trange de dire en effet qu'une clause de r\u00e9vocation dans un testament nul est inexistante, et que cependant une semblable clause dans un testament non l\u00e9galement prouv\u00e9 est valide. Enfin, m\u00eame s'il fallait admettre la th\u00e9orie de la divisibilit\u00e9 des testaments perdus, et s'il \u00e9tait permis comme le sugg\u00e8re l'intim\u00e9e, de ne consid\u00e9rer qu'une clause isol\u00e9e de r\u00e9vocation, je suis loin d'\u00eatre certain dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, que la perte du document qui r\u00e9voque a \u00e9t\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat d'un \"cas impr\u00e9vu\", tel que l'exige 1233 (6) C.C.\nDe plus, en vertu des dispositions de l'article 892 du Code Civil, les testaments peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9s par un testament post\u00e9rieur qui les r\u00e9voque express\u00e9ment ou par la nature de ses dispositions. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, l'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que le premier testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 par un second testament qui contient une clause expresse de r\u00e9vocation. Ce serait contredire les termes pr\u00e9cis de l'article 756 du Code Civil, qui dit qu'un testament ne peut avoir effet qu'apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du testateur, que de soutenir que la clause de r\u00e9vocation qui y est contenue, a pris effet au moment o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite, et qu'elle aurait ainsi r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 le premier testament, eo instanti.\nAucun jugement n'a jamais sanctionn\u00e9 cette pr\u00e9tention, et aucun auteur n'a enseign\u00e9 cette doctrine. Un testament est indivisible. On ne peut donner effet \u00e0 aucune de ses clauses durant la vie du testateur. Comme le dit Langelier (Cour de Droit Civil, Vol. 3, page 8):\u2014\nIl r\u00e9sulte de l\u00e0 que, tant que le testateur vit, le testament reste d\u00e9pourvu de tout effet.\nPour appuyer la th\u00e8se de la divisibilit\u00e9 du testament, on invoque l'article 896 C.C, qui dit qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut de dispositions expresses, c'est par les circonstances et les indices de l'intention du testateur, qu'il est d\u00e9cid\u00e9 si la r\u00e9vocation du testament qui en r\u00e9voque un autre, est destin\u00e9e \u00e0 faire revivre un testament ant\u00e9rieur. Il s'ensuivrait que dans le cas de destruction volontaire d'un testament par un testateur, (ce qui en vertu de 892(3) C.C. est une cause de r\u00e9vocation), il serait permis de consid\u00e9rer isol\u00e9ment une clause de r\u00e9vocation d'un testament ant\u00e9rieur, et de lui donner effet au moment o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite.\nJe ne puis admettre cette pr\u00e9tention. En France, la destruction volontaire par le testateur n'est pas reconnue par le Code comme un mode de r\u00e9vocation, mais les auteurs et la jurisprudence l'ont toujours admise, et lui ont donn\u00e9 effet, parce que, dit-on, c'est tellement \u00e9vident, qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de le consigner dans le texte de l'article 1035 du Code Napol\u00e9on. De plus, le Code Fran\u00e7ais n'a pas d'article correspondant \u00e0 notre article 896. Cependant, cet article n'est pas de droit nouveau, et quand ils l'ont incorpor\u00e9 dans notre Code, les codificateurs ne faisaient que s'inspirer de la doctrine fran\u00e7aise. (2 Bourjon, 390; Troplong, Donations, 2065). Vide \u00e9galement (Dupuis et al v. Dupuis 33.\nIl faut donc conclure qu'en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9vocation des testaments, notre loi est pratiquement semblable \u00e0 la loi fran\u00e7aise, et que pour en pr\u00e9ciser le sens et la port\u00e9e, on peut s'inspirer des commentateurs fran\u00e7ais. Or en France, un testament d\u00e9truit volontairement par le testateur est inexistant. Il faut le consid\u00e9rer comme n'ayant jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit, et on ne peut donner effet \u00e0 aucune de ses clauses. (Ripert, Trait\u00e9 de Droit Civil, 4\u00e8me Ed., Vol. 3, p. 665 ; Planiol et Ripert, Trait\u00e9 Pratique de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, Vol. 5, p. 765; Colin et Capitant, Vol. 3, Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, p. 904; Pandectes Fran\u00e7aises, Donations et Testaments, Vol. 26, p. 303; Aubry et Rau, Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, Vol. 10, p. 457; Demolombe, Cours de Droit Civil, Vol. 18, p. 28; Laurent, Principes de Droit Civil, Vol. 11, p. 130).\nLe testament en effet est une disposition \u00e0 cause de mort, un acte de derni\u00e8re volont\u00e9. Durant toute la vie de son auteur, il n'est qu'un simple projet qu'il peut modifier ou d\u00e9truire \u00e0 son gr\u00e9. Seule la mort du testateur transforme ce projet en disposition. Ceci doit n\u00e9cessairement s'appliquer \u00e0 toutes les clauses de l'\u00e9crit. (Baudry-Lacantinerie, Droit Civil, Vol. 2, page 250).\nC'est \u00e9videmment pour cela que Troplong, (Droit Civil, Donations et Testaments, Vol. 3, page 565) enseigne que la reconnaissance d'une dette dans un testament ne serait pas un titre du vivant du testateur, car un testament ne produit d'effet qu'apr\u00e8s la mort, et que Merlin (R\u00e9p. de Jurisprudence, Vol. 34, page 216) a \u00e9crit que celui au profit duquel a \u00e9t\u00e9 consign\u00e9e dans un testament, la reconnaissance d'une dette, est sans action, apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9vocation de ce testament, pour exiger sa pr\u00e9tendue cr\u00e9ance. (Vide \u00e9galement Toullier, Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, Vol. 5, page 588). Si tel est le cas, comme je le crois, il s'ensuivrait qu'un testament est indivisible de sa nature, et qu'une clause de r\u00e9vocation dans un testament que d\u00e9truit son auteur, ne peut avoir plus d'effet juridique que le testament lui-m\u00eame.\nJe crois donc que l'article 896 C.C. ne peut aider \u00e0 la solution de la pr\u00e9sente cause. Cet article ne trouve son application que lorsqu'il s'agit d'interpr\u00e9ter la port\u00e9e de certaines clauses de r\u00e9vocation contenues dans les testaments existants, ou l\u00e9galement prouv\u00e9s, qui produisent leur effet, mais non pas dans un testament d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment d\u00e9truit par son auteur, car alors il n'y a plus de testament. C'est ce que semblent dire implicitement les codificateurs dans leur quatri\u00e8me rapport \u00e0 la page 184, quand ils notent que l'article 896 C.C. \"expose ce qui a rapport \u00e0 la r\u00e9vocation, quand il y a plus d'un testament.\"\nD'ailleurs, m\u00eame si cet article pouvait \u00eatre l\u00e9galement invoqu\u00e9, il ne pourrait trouver son application, car ni le testament olographe, ni la clause de r\u00e9vocation ne sont l\u00e9galement prouv\u00e9s.\nUne derni\u00e8re observation s'impose. Je n'oublie pas ce qu'a dit le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Mignault v. Malo 34. Il est vrai que la loi qui a introduit dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec le testament fait suivant la forme d\u00e9riv\u00e9e des lois anglaises, a \u00e9galement, d'apr\u00e8s le Conseil Priv\u00e9, introduit les incidents qui s'y rattachent, mais m\u00eame si ce jugement rendu sur des faits ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la promulgation du Code, doit encore nous guider, ce dont je doute fort, (Vide 2613 C.C.) je ne crois pas que l'on puisse consid\u00e9rer comme incident d'un testament anglais, la preuve d'un testament olographe ou notari\u00e9 ou d'une clause de r\u00e9vocation qui y est contenue. Le mot \"incident\" tel qu'employ\u00e9 par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 n'a pas cette \u00e9tendue qu'on pr\u00e9tend lui donner. Il ne doit comprendre que les accessoires du testament lui-m\u00eame, et non pas les clauses ni la preuve de ces clauses dans un testament post\u00e9rieur olographe ou notari\u00e9, qui doivent \u00eatre prouv\u00e9es suivant les dispositions du Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nPour toutes ces raisons, je crois que l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours, et le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure r\u00e9tabli.\nRand J.: I find it unnecessary to pass upon the question of competency or of mistake as to the nature of the document signed and duress was not argued. I shall deal only with the question of the effect of the holographic will upon the prior will.\nUpon the death of a person, a document executed by him is either a will or it is not and either it is then in physical existence or it is not: if it does exist but cannot be found, we say that it is or has been lost. In its primary meaning \"lost\" signifies that the whereabouts of the document are or have become unknown relatively to a person interested in its custody: the notion in law is referred ordinarily to the present time when the document is sought to be used as a fact of legal significance. The initial and general question is not whether, during the life of the testator and unknown to him, it had been or became lost: he might have placed it in what he thought a safe place which to his successors is an undiscoverable place, and as to them it is lost: as to him and them also, the document might, unknown to both, be in the possession of third persons, and so far lost. On the other hand, if the document is not physically in existence, its destruction may have been due to accident or mishap known or unknown to the testator; or to his own intentional act or to another person's act known or unknown to him.\nAll those possibilities are envisaged by the language, as I read it, of art. 860. That article deals with the case of a document claimed to be the last will of a deceased person which for various reasons cannot be produced before the Court. It is as follows:\u2014\nWhen the minute or the original of a will has been lost or destroyed by a fortuitous event, after the death of the testator, or has been withheld without collusion, by an adversary or by a third party, the will may be proved in the manner provided in such case for other acts and writings in the title Of Obligations. If the will have been destroyed or lost before the death of the testator, without the fact ever having come to his knowledge, it may be proved in the same manner as if the accident had occurred after his death. If the testator knew of the destruction or loss of the will and did not provide for such destruction or loss, he is held to have revoked it, unless he subsequently manifests his intention of maintaining its provisions.\nThat a document has been \"lost or destroyed by a fortuitous\" event must, I think, extend to every case of loss or destruction of which the testator remains unaware. If destruction has been effected by a third person and is unknown to the testator, it must be taken to be within the article for otherwise there would be the absurdity that a retention by a third person would open the way to oral proof of the contents but that his act of destruction during that detention would not: that act would, therefore, be a \"cas fortuit.\" Where an act of the other person causing or the event of accidental loss or destruction was or has become known to the testator, it is seen to be deemed to be the act of the testator and prima facie a revocation.\n\"Lost\" can have a more extended meaning to include destruction as in the expression \"lost his life\" and art. 1233 would appear to bear the broader signification.\nWhat art. 860 in part does, then, is to declare that where it can be shown that through an unknown accident or mishap or the unknown act of a third person a will has been lost or destroyed before the death, its contents can be proved by oral testimony for the purpose of establishing its provisions as testamentary dispositions. When the destruction is by an act from which the presumption of revocation arises, the article has no application.\nIn the latter case art. 896 comes into play. It reads:\u2014\nIn the absence of express dispositions, the circumstances and the indications of the intention of the testator determine whether, upon the revocation of a will which revokes another will, the former will revives.\nThe condition of its application is the revocation of a testament by any means permitted by the Code. Art. 892 expressly provides for revocation by destruction. When, therefore, such a revocation is shown, art. 896, to prevent its purpose from being defeated, necessarily implies that the revocation by the destroyed will of a previous will may likewise be proved by parol evidence.\nThe effect of these two articles, 860 and 896, is, then, that if, on the death of a testator, a testamentary document shown to have previously existed cannot be found, the actual circumstances causing that undiscoverability lie necessarily within one of them, and that a common minimum proof in both cases is provided for. If those circumstances here are within 860, the entire contents of the holograph will can be proved for all testamentary purposes; and if within 896, likewise the fact that the lost instrument revokes absolutely the previous will. Proof of the fact of revocation is thus seen to arise under both articles; and because the case is necessarily within one of them, that fact may, in any event, be so established. It may be that the express preliminary proof required for each article prevents the case from being brought specifically within either; but what can be shown is that, so far, an unqualified revocation of the first will was effected at the moment of the making of the second; and that there is nothing in the circumstances from which an intention to revive the first could be drawn. In that situation the original will remains revoked, and the second document remains unprovable as a testamentary instrument until the actual circumstances of its loss or destruction can be established.\nIn the meantime, there is no testamentary disposition standing in the way of the heir. Should either document later appear in proof as a will, the case would be the not infrequent one of an initial assumption of fact being later superseded by proof of another actual fact; but in neither case is the initial revocation of the first will in any manner or degree affected. The position of the heir may be said to be provisional, but it is the same as in any case where a will subsequently appears and supersedes action taken on the other assumption.\nThis result, apart from the question of revivor, is that reached under the English law by the use of a presumption of fact that if a document is traced to the possession of the testator and at his death cannot be found, it is presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have been destroyed by him animo revocandi. If that were applied here, art. 896 would likewise open the way to proof that the second will revoked the first.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKellock J.:\u2014I agree with my brother Taschereau that the requirements of Article 851 of the Civil Code, as to execution of the first will, were met, and that the ground upon which the Court of Appeal 35 proceeded in setting aside the first will is not sufficiently made out by the evidence. The question remains as to the effect, if any, to be given to the second will.\nSubject to the question as to admissibility of the evidence, the making of the second will was established to the satisfaction of the learned trial judge and, by reason of Article 892(1), the first will was thereby revoked, eo instanti. This is implicit in Article 896 which provides that evidence may be given to establish whether, upon the revocation of a will which revokes an earlier will, the latter revives.\nIt is, however, contended for the appellant, upon the basis of Article 860, that, as the second will is not forthcoming and the reason therefor is not known with certainty, proof of its contents is not admissible for any purpose. Before considering this Article, it is, as will subsequently appear, important first to consider Article 1233 (6) which is the general rule dealing with proof by oral evidence. Article 1233(6) reads as follows:\u2014\n1233. Proof may be made by testimony:\n(6) In cases in which the proof in writing has been lost by unforeseen accident, or is in the possession of the adverse party or of a third person without collusion of the party claiming, and cannot be produced.\nThis paragraph appears in Article 252 of the First Report of the Codifiers, and its antecedents are set out immediately following the Article itself, on p. 127 of the First Volume. Included in these references is para. 815 of Pothier which deals with the admission of oral evidence where the document relied upon is not forthcoming \"par cas fortuit et impr\u00e9vu.\" The author says that if the person seeking to adduce oral testimony alleges only that he has lost his documents without establishing force majeure, such proof is not admissible because of the possible danger of perjured evidence. The Codifiers also refer to s. 558 of the American work, Greenleaf on Evidence, which reads, in part, as follows:\nIf the instrument is lost, the party is required to give some evidence, that such a paper once existed, though slight evidence is sufficient for this purpose, and that a bona fide and diligent search has been unsuccessfully made for it in the place where it was most likely to be found, if the nature of the case admits such proof; after which, his own affidavit is admissible to the fact of its loss. The same rule prevails where the instrument is destroyed \u2026 the question, whether the loss of the instrument is sufficiently proved to admit secondary evidence of its contents, is to be determined by the Court, and not by the Jury. But it seems, that, in general, the party is expected to show that he has in good faith exhausted, in a reasonable degree, all the sources of information and means of discovery which the nature of the case would naturally suggest, and which were accessible to him. It should be recollected, that the object of the proof is merely to establish a reasonable presumption of the loss of the instrument; and that this is a preliminary inquiry addressed to the discretion of the Judge. \u2026 Satisfactory proof being thus made of the loss of the instrument, the party will be admitted to give secondary evidence of its contents.\nIn the language actually used by the Codifiers in the Article,\nhas been lost by unforeseen accident,\nit is clear, in my opinion, that the standard laid down in Pothier and other authorities to the same effect, was not adopted, but the standard laid down in Greenleaf. While the Codifiers include among the sources of Article 1233, Article 1341 of the Napoleonic Code, they do not include Article 1348 (4) which uses the words, \"par suite d'un cas fortuit, impr\u00e9vu et r\u00e9sultant d'une force majeure.\" At p. 30 of their First Report, the Codifiers say that Article 252 \"enumerates the cases in which proof may be made by testimony. They are carefully collated from the authorities cited under the Article, and are believed to shew all the exceptions introduced by legislation or jurisprudence to the general rule requiring proof by writing.\"\nThere is, of course, no question but that whatever may have been the intention of the Codifiers, it is the actual language used in the Code which governs, and in my opinion, the words actually used, \"lost by unforeseen accident\" (\"cas impr\u00e9vu\") mean simply loss by chance as opposed to design. Accordingly, where, as in the case at bar, a document has once been proved to have existed but cannot be found after the requisite search called for by the circumstances, it is permitted by the terms of Article 1233 (6) to prove its contents by secondary evidence. This view has, long since, been accepted by the Court of Appeal of the province.\nIn Ball v. Rolland 36, a letter had been an exhibit in a previous action but was not forthcoming at the time of the trial of the action in the case under consideration. Secondary evidence of its contents having been refused in the Superior Court, this decision was set aside on appeal. The court, consisting of Archibald, Mercier and Greenshields, JJ., held that the case came within the provisions of Article 1233 (6). Greenshields J., as he then was, after referring to the view of the learned trial judge that the matter in question was not within para. 1 of the Article, said, at p. 184:\nOur law, under Art. 1233, sub-par. 6, makes no distinction between a writing evidencing a commercial contract and one containing proof of a civil contract. In both cases, and with equal force proof may be made by testimony, providing the foundation is laid, viz.: the loss or disappearance of the document \u2026 If it had not been lost; no proof would be required, and it is for the reason that it is lost, through no fault of the plaintiff, that the law gives him the right to establish, if he can, that the contract did exist, and existed in the very terms alleged.\nAnd at p. 185:\nThe circumstances attending its loss or disappearance can certainly be made by verbal testimony, it cannot be otherwise, and when this has been made, it follows, as night follows day, that the contents can be proved, and proved by parole testimony.\nThis decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nA similar view was taken by the Court of Review in Filiatrault v. Feeny 37. In that case, a deed had disappeared from the office of a notary and, although a search had been made, it could not be found. The court admitted secondary evidence. The reasons for judgment of Archibald J. at p. 17 are pertinent. In part, they are as follows:\nThe defendant was, therefore, obliged to attempt secondary proof of the contents of the deed. To this the plaintiff objected on the ground that the mere loss of a document for a reason which cannot be explained, as, for example, through the fault and negligence of the notary, without proof of any occurrence of inevitable accident, does not justify secondary proof. Defendant practically admits that under the jurisprudence founded on the Code Napol\u00e9on, this view would be probably supported, but defendant claims that our Code has introduced a change in the position. After referring to the difference in wording between Article 1348 C.N. and Article 1233 (6), Archibald J. continued at p. 18:\nI am of opinion that when parties go before a notary and make an authentic contract which the law requires the notary to preserve with great care, and by some inexplicable circumstance the minute has disappeared without the fault of the parties, this constitutes a cas impr\u00e9vu, or unforeseen accident sufficient to justify secondary proof.\nAccordingly, were Article 1233 (6) to govern the question as to the admissibility of secondary evidence to prove the contents of the will of April 29, 1947, it is clear, in my opinion, that the provisions of the Article authorize such proof. I think, however, that Article 860, being a special provision, is the one which applies where the document sought to be proved is a will, rather than Article 1233 (6). It reads as follows:\n860. When the minute or the original of a will has been lost or destroyed by a fortuitous event, after the death of the testator, or has been withheld without collusion, by an adversary or by a third party, the will may be proved in the manner provided in such case for other acts and writings in the title Of Obligations.\nIf the will have been destroyed or lost before the death of the testator, without the fact ever having come to his knowledge, it may be proved in the same manner as if the accident had occurred after his death.\nIf the testator knew of the destruction or loss of the will and did not provide for such destruction or loss, he is held to have revoked it, unless he subsequently manifests his intention of maintaining its provisions.\nGrammatically, the words, \"by a fortuitous event,\" do not necessarily modify the word \"lost,\" but only the word \"destroyed.\" It is contended, however, that they apply to both and that in order that secondary proof may be given of the later will, it must be established that its non-production is due to an event \"unforeseen and caused by superior force which it was impossible to resist,\" which is the meaning given by Article 17 (24) to the words, \"fortuitous event\" or \"cas fortuit,\" used in Article 860. In my opinion, this contention is not well founded.\nIt is not difficult to think of a \"destruction\" of the character described in Article 17 (24), but difficult if not impossible, to imagine a \"loss,\" as distinct from a \"destruction,\" of that character. While, as I have already said, it is the language actually found in the Code and not what the Codifiers say in their reports which is to govern, one experiences the more confidence in his opinion as to the construction of the language used in the Code when one finds that opinion was also apparently the opinion of the Codifiers themselves. In their Fifth Report, Vol. II, p. 179, the Codifiers state with respect to Article 860 that, in the first place,\nit is in accordance with the authorities taken from both sources of law,\ni.e. both French and English sources.\nAs already pointed out in discussing the effect of Article 1233 (6), the requirements laid down by Pothier which must be met before secondary evidence of the contents of non-produced documents may be given, are quite foreign to English law, the rule of that law being as already quoted from Greenleaf. Accordingly, if Article 860 is at all in accordance with \"the authorities taken from\" English law, it can be so only if the words, \"by a fortuitous event,\" do not apply to the word \"lost\" as used in that Article.\nThere is further clear evidence that this was the intention of the Codifiers, as they also state on the same page mentioned above, that Article 860 is in accordance with\nwhat has been adopted concerning acts in general in the title \"Of Obligations\".\nThis is a clear reference to the law as adopted in Article 1233 (6), and that law can only be in accordance with Article 860 if the last-mentioned Article is to be read as already indicated. At the end of Article 860 (116 in their draft Code) the Codifiers themselves list Article 252 as well as 236 (1217), 237-a (1218) and 10 (51). The first makes use of the words, \"lost by unforeseen accident,\" the second, \"destroyed by fire or other accident or otherwise lost,\" and the last simply, \"lost.\" These references would be quite meaningless if it were necessary in every case of loss or destruction to establish an event occurring by force majeure before Article 860 is to be satisfied.\nA non-produced will is either in existence or it is not. If destroyed, it may have been destroyed (a) by the testator himself or by his direction, or (b) by some other agency. If (a), then Article 892 (3) will apply and the will is to be considered revoked, subject to evidence of the character provided for in Article 896. If (b), then Article 860 becomes relevant and the question of revocation appears to depend upon whether or not the testator knew of the destruction. If the will is still in existence, it may be in the hands of some third person, or it may have been \"lost\" in the sense that it is not forthcoming and cannot be found. Article 860 deals with both.\nWhere one finds, as in Article 860, both words, \"lost\" and \"destroyed,\" used, I do not know, as I have already said, what significance can be given to the former by attaching to it the words by which Article 17 (24) defines \"fortuitous event.\" A document which has \"gone astray\" or is \"no longer to be found\" by reason of an event \"caused by superior force which it was impossible to resist,\" involves a conception which to my mind is self-contradictory. If a document has \"gone astray\" or \"cannot be found,\" that would appear to exhaust the situation. If one is able to specify the event responsible for the non-production, it seems to me that the document becomes \"lost,\" not in the sense of having gone astray, but as having perished, that is, \"destroyed.\" Accordingly, while the phrase, \"lost or destroyed,\" in Article 860 becomes \"destruction or loss\" in the reference in Article 892 (3) to Article 860, the change in order involves no change in the meaning which can be given to the words.\nAt this point, the provisions of Article 861 may also be referred to. That Article provides for probate \"in conformity with\" Article 860 of \"a non-produced will\" upon \"positive proof both of the facts which justify such a proceeding and of the contents of the will.\" The Article goes on to provide that in such case, proof of the will will be held to be established \"according to the proof deemed sufficient and to whatever modifications may be found in the judgment.\"\nAmong the references given by the Codifiers under the Article is Greenleaf, Vol. 11, s. 688 (a), which reads as follows:\nIf the will is proved to be lost, it may still be admitted to probate, upon secondary evidence, as in the case of lost deeds and other writings. And though, as we have seen, if the will, shown once to have existed, cannot be found after the death of the testator, the presumption is that he destroyed it, animo revocandi, yet this presumption may be rebutted by evidence. But if it be so rebutted, yet the contents of the will cannot be proved, unless by the clearest and most stringent evidence.\nTo what extent this statement of English law may be considered to have been embodied in the Code it is not necessary to determine in the present case. This much is, however, in my opinion, clear from the terms of Articles 860 and 861 themselves, that both contemplate proof of the contents of a will proved to have been made but which those claiming under it are unable to produce because it is \"lost,\" in the sense already explained.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the facts as found by the learned trial judge enable the court to say that the proof of the making and contents of the second will establish the revocation of the first will. In the existing state of the record, there is no evidence upon which the court could find that this will remained an effective instrument and was not revoked. In these circumstances, I concur in the view that the deceased died intestate. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nCartwright J.: For the reasons given by my brother Fauteux I agree with him that the Court of Appeal 38 rightly concluded that, when he executed the instrument of the 22nd of April, 1947, the deceased, Langlais, did not realize what he was signing and that his will did not go along with the signing of the document.\nAt the risk of repetition, it appears to me that no adequate explanation has been offered of the fact that garde Ouellet some minutes after she had signed as a witness to the instrument of April 22, 1947, asked the deceased:\u2014 \"Savez-vous ce que vous venez de signer l\u00e0?\" The fact of the question being asked at all by this witness who knew that the document just signed purported to be a will is of the utmost significance. She must surely have been prompted to ask it by something in the appearance or manner of Langlais which caused her to believe that he did not realize what he was doing. His reply to her and his subsequent statements to L'Abb\u00e9 Brochu indicate that such belief was well founded.\nWhile this is sufficient to dispose of the appeal I wish also to deal with another aspect of the matter. As is clearly shown in the reasons of my brother Fauteux, the evidence (always subject to the question of its admissibility) established beyond peradventure that the deceased did on the 29th of April write out and sign a will in holograph form which expressly revoked the will of the 22nd of April. The learned trial judge had no doubt as to this. He says, in part:\u2014\n\u2026certainement il l'a r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 par le testament du 29 avril, pourvu toutefois qu'il laissait subsister la r\u00e9vocation;\nHe was however of the opinion that the will of the 29th of April had in its turn been revoked and that the result of such revocation was to revive the earlier will of the 22nd of April. He puts the matter as follows:\u2014\n\u2026 mais s'il d\u00e9truisait le document qui r\u00e9voquait, il devait savoir que la r\u00e9vocation projet\u00e9e devenait caduque; le fait de reprendre le document pour le modifier, impliquait qu'il allait d\u00e9truire le premier, et le remplacer par un autre; s'il n'y avait que des modifications tout en laissant subsister les premi\u00e8res dispositions, il n'avait qu'\u00e0 ajouter par codicile; du moment qu'il d\u00e9truisait le premier, il mit fin \u00e0 tout son contenu, et s'il d\u00e9sirait remettre en vigueur quelque partie de ce qu'il avait d\u00e9truit, il devait le faire express\u00e9ment; il n'a pas fait \u00e7a, et ne faut-il pas conclure qu'il ne d\u00e9sira pas revivre ce qu'il avait d\u00e9truit;\nHaving taken this view it was perhaps unnecessary for the learned trial judge to consider whether the execution of the will of the 29th of April was sufficiently proved by admissible evidence and he does not deal with this expressly but it seems to me to be implicit in his reasons that he regarded the execution of the will of the 29th as properly proved, by which I mean proved by legally admissible evidence. The learned judges of the Court of Appeal, having reached the same conclusion as my brother Fauteux, did not find it necessary to examine this question.\nIt was, however, argued before us with great force that under the law of Quebec, differing in this respect from the Common Law, it was not permissible to prove that the will of the 29th of April had been executed and contained a clause of revocation. It was urged that the Court must therefore decide the case as if the only evidence before it was that of the execution of the document of the 22nd of April, 1947, and that if on the evidence it were held that at the time of its execution it was the free act of a competent testator it must be admitted to probate.\nOn this branch of the matter I agree with the conclusion of my brother Rand. The relevant sections of the Civil Code when read together and applied to the facts of this case appear to me to indicate that the fact that the will of the 22nd of April, 1947, if otherwise valid, was effectively revoked by the holograph will of the 29th of April, 1947, may be proved by oral testimony.\nI am in agreement with the learned trial judge that the destruction of the will of the 29th of April by the testator animo revocandi has been sufficiently proved as a fact by the evidence of L'Abb\u00e9 Brochu coupled with the proof that after the death of Langlais the will could not be found. If authority is needed to shew that the fact of such destruction may be proved in this manner reference may be made to Laurent, Principes de Droit Civil (1878) Vol. 14, pages 268 to 269:\u2014\nTandis que la r\u00e9vocation par le destruction de l'acte n'est certes pas un acte solennel, c'est un fait mat\u00e9riel; il s'agit de prouver le fait et, s'il y a lieu, l'intention du testateur. Ici c'est une question de preuve, et par cons\u00e9quent il faut appliquer le droit commun. Or, il est de principe, comme nous le dirons au titre des Obligations, que les faits mat\u00e9riels se prouvent par t\u00e9moins, donc par pr\u00e9somptions.\nI am unable to agree with the learned trial judge that this revocation had the effect of reviving the earlier will. Whether or not this would be so must be determined under the provisions of section 896 of the Code by the circumstances (which I take to mean, all the circumstances of the case) and by the indications of the intention of the testator. I can find no circumstance and no indication of the intention of the testator which suggests that he intended by revoking the second will to revive the first. Indeed, all the evidence that has any bearing on this question seems to me to point clearly to the contrary conclusion.\nThe fact of destruction animo revocandi having been established it is next necessary to consider the effect of the relevant sections of the Civil Code. In doing so it is well to bear in mind the provisions of section 12 of the Code:\u2014\nWhen a law is doubtful or ambiguous, it is to be interpreted so as to fulfil the intention of the legislature, and to attain the object for which it was passed.\nand also the elementary rule that construction is to be made of all the relevant parts of the statute together and not of one part only by itself. \"Incivile est nisi tota lege perspecta una aliqua particula ejus proposita judicare vel respondere.\" Dig. 1, 3, 24, Corpus Juris Civilis 11th Edition, Volume 1, page 34. The result appears to me to be as follows:\u2014\n(i) The instrument of the 22nd of April (assuming that it was the free act of a competent testator) was valid under section 842 (3) of the Civil Code.\n(ii) The instrument of the 29th of April was valid by virtue of section 842 (2).\n(iii) The last-mentioned instrument effectively revoked that of the 22nd of April by virtue of section 892 (1).\n(iv) The instrument of the 29th of April was in turn effectively revoked by destruction animo revocandi by virtue of section 892 (3).\n(v) Whether upon the revocation of the will of April 29th the will of April 22nd revived, then fell to be determined under the provisions of section 896 reading as follows:\u2014\nIn the absence of express dispositions, the circumstances and the indications of the intention of the testator determine whether upon the revocation of a will which revokes another will, the former will revives.\nIt appears to me that the effect of holding that the fact of the execution of the second will and the fact that it contained a clause revoking the first cannot be proved by oral testimony would be to nullify the provisions of section 896 in every case in which the second will was either in holograph form or in the form derived from the laws of England and was revoked by destruction animo revocandi. To so hold would be to construe section 896 as if there were added to it a clause to the following effect:\u2014\nProvided, however, that if the second will was in holograph form or in the form derived from the laws of England and was revoked by destruction animo revocandi then it shall be conclusively presumed that the former will revives.\nIt appears to me that to adopt such a construction would be to defeat the intention of the legislature expressed in section 896, rather than to fulfil it as section 12 requires us to do. No counterpart of section 896 is found in the Code Napol\u00e9on. It is a provision of great importance and to give it effect it is necessary that oral proof of the second will should be received whenever it is shown that such document has been destroyed by the testator animo revocandi. It is a special provision and if such proof is apparently prohibited by the general provisions of section 1233 then such general provisions must yield; generalia specialibus non derogant. It must be remembered that what is to be proved by oral and circumstantial testimony is not a document to which testamentary effect is to be given. Ex hypothesi the testamentary effect of the second will has gone because it has been destroyed not \"par cas fortuit\" or \"par cas impr\u00e9vu\" but deliberately and with the intention of revoking it. It appears to me to be implicit in the wording of section 896 that the earlier will is gone eo instanti when the later one, which revokes it, is executed, subject only to the possibility of its being revived not merely by the revocation of the later will but by such revocation coupled with circumstances and indications of intention shewing that the testator intended to revive the earlier. To accept the appellant's argument on this point would render section 896 nugatory. It would bring about the result that the earlier will, if still in existence, would ipso facto revive on the destruction of the later and the determination of the question which under section 896 is to be made in accordance with the circumstances and indications of the intention of the testator would become a mere matter of chance depending upon the means of revocation of the second will adopted by the testator.\nFor all of the above reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be disposed of as proposed in the judgment of my brother Fauteux.\nFauteux J.: Appelante et intim\u00e9e se disputent les biens laiss\u00e9s par Joseph Firmin Langlais \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, survenu \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, le 27 novembre 1948.

C'est l'admissibilit\u00e9 de cette preuve, faite par t\u00e9moins, qui est sous question.\nC'est l'intim\u00e9e qui a pris l'initiative de l'action en justice pour demander l'annulation du premier testament et la reconnaissance de son titre d'h\u00e9riti\u00e8re l\u00e9gale.\nCette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure laquelle, pour le motif que les formalit\u00e9s requises par la loi avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 suivies, a affirm\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 du premier testament et, quant au second, a conclu \u00e0 sa destruction animo revocandi et, de ce fait, \u00e0 la remise en vigueur du premier.\nLa Cour d'Appel 39 a cass\u00e9 ce jugement. A l'unanimit\u00e9, elle en est venue \u00e0 la conclusion qu'en signant le premier testament, Langlais a cru signer autre chose, et que cet \u00e9crit n'a pas re\u00e7u \"l'adh\u00e9sion libre d'une volont\u00e9 \u00e9clair\u00e9e.\" En cons\u00e9quence, l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e seule h\u00e9riti\u00e8re l\u00e9gale de Firmin Langlais et les questions relatives au second testament n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9es au jugement de cette Cour.\nDevant nous, l'appelante a plaid\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 du premier testament et l'absence de preuve l\u00e9gale du second.\nSur le testament olographe du 29 avril 1947. Il n'y a aucun doute que Langlais, sept jours \u00e0 peine apr\u00e8s la confection du premier testament, a fait un testament olographe. Le fait est affirm\u00e9 par l'abb\u00e9 Brochu; ce testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en sa pr\u00e9sence et, pendant plus d'un an, il en est rest\u00e9 en possession, \u00e0 la demande de Langlais. Ce testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement vu par d'autres personnes et, quelques quinze mois apr\u00e8s sa confection, Langlais l'a repris pour le refaire. Plus tard, et apr\u00e8s en avoir repris possession, il affirma au notaire Sirois que ses biens allaient \u00e0 sa fille, l'intim\u00e9e, qu'il avait fait un testament \u00e0 cet effet mais qu'il entendait y ajouter des legs particuliers. Tous ces faits sont accept\u00e9s comme prouv\u00e9s par le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, lequel a, de plus, accept\u00e9 que, suivant ses termes, ce testament r\u00e9voquait le premier et constituait l'intim\u00e9e h\u00e9riti\u00e8re. Mais, conc\u00e9dant d'une part que la disparition de ce testament restait inexpliqu\u00e9e, le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance n'en a pas moins conclu qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truit par Langlais animo revocandi. Ce testament olographe du 29 avril 1947\u2014le dernier en date\u2014serait, par ses dispositions, d\u00e9cisif du litige, r\u00e9voquerait le premier testament et constituerait clairement l'intim\u00e9e seule h\u00e9riti\u00e8re des biens de Langlais, n'\u00e9tait-ce le jugement qu'il faut rendre sur l'objection faite \u00e0 l'admissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve orale. En effet, pour lui donner tous les effets juridiques qui lui sont propres, i.e., r\u00e9voquer le premier testament et d\u00e9clarer l'intim\u00e9e h\u00e9riti\u00e8re testamentaire, il faut d'abord que ce testament olographe ait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement prouv\u00e9. Et c'est l\u00e0 la seule et v\u00e9ritable question qui se pose sur ce testament. Comme mon coll\u00e8gue, le Juge Taschereau, j'en suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que les facteurs conditionnant l'admissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve testimoniale faite pour donner effet aux dispositions de ce testament, n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9s en cette cause et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, l'intim\u00e9e ne peut h\u00e9riter en vertu du testament olographe du 29 avril 1947. De plus, et outre la clause de r\u00e9vocation y contenue, ce document comportant des dispositions expresses de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s, je ne puis le diviser pour le traiter comme un simple \u00e9crit de r\u00e9vocation au sens du paragraphe 2 de l'article 892.\nSur le premier testament, celui du 22 avril 1947. Le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de ce premier testament sur la base des deux consid\u00e9rants suivants:\u2014\nDe l'avis de cette Cour, les preuves de l'accomplissement des formalit\u00e9s requises pour le testament du 22 avril 1947 sont tellement pr\u00e9cises et certaines qu'elles ne pourraient \u00eatre mises de c\u00f4t\u00e9 par cette question et r\u00e9ponse dont parle Mademoiselle Ouellet;\nDe l'avis de cette Cour, il appert que toutes les formalit\u00e9s requises par la loi \u00e9taient remplies et observ\u00e9es dans l'ex\u00e9cution du testament du 22 avril 1947.\nL'accomplissement des formalit\u00e9s, \u00e9tabli par des preuves claires et pr\u00e9cises\u2014preuves que \"la question et r\u00e9ponse dont parle Mademoiselle Ouellet\" ne saurait \u00e9carter\u2014 constitue donc l'unique raison sur laquelle se fonde le jugement affirmant la validit\u00e9 de ce premier testament.\nD'autre part, le jugement de la Cour d'Appel 40, cassant celui de premi\u00e8re instance, repose sur le motif que cet \u00e9crit du 22 avril 1947 \"n'a pas re\u00e7u l'adh\u00e9sion libre d'une volont\u00e9 \u00e9clair\u00e9e et que, partant, il doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9.\"\nCes deux consid\u00e9rants du jugement de premi\u00e8re instance sugg\u00e8rent les observations suivantes. En premier lieu, la preuve de l'accomplissement des formalit\u00e9s d'un acte, solennel ou non, ne saurait, sans un texte pr\u00e9cis \u00e0 cet effet\u2014et il n'en existe pas en l'esp\u00e8ce\u2014 \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une pr\u00e9somption juris et de jure de sa validit\u00e9. Autrement, ce serait couvrir par des formalit\u00e9s, l'erreur, l'absence de volont\u00e9, la fraude, \u2026 autant de causes qui vicient dans son essence l'apparente adh\u00e9sion du signataire d'un acte.\nOutre l'inaccomplissement des formalit\u00e9s, l'intim\u00e9e en la pr\u00e9sente instance a plaid\u00e9, particuli\u00e8rement au paragraphe 16 de la d\u00e9claration, que Langlais n'a pas r\u00e9alis\u00e9 ce qu'il signait et qu'il n'a jamais voulu signer un testament dans les termes du document du 22 avril 1947. On a donc invoqu\u00e9 deux faits d\u00e9finitivement subjectifs et, comme tels, susceptibles l'un et l'autre d'\u00eatre soustraits, non seulement \u00e0 l'observation des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 l'acte, mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 la conscience de celui qui l'ex\u00e9cutait au moment m\u00eame o\u00f9 l'acte \u00e9tait sign\u00e9. Si donc l'un ou l'autre, ou ces deux faits sont prouv\u00e9s, l'accomplissement le plus parfait des formalit\u00e9s ne saurait autoriser la conclusion de validit\u00e9. A cet \u00e9gard, il faut aussi imm\u00e9diatement observer que la \"question et r\u00e9ponse dont parle Mademoiselle Ouellet\" est loin d'\u00eatre le seul \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer, tel que je me propose de l'indiquer.\nUne derni\u00e8re observation. Celle-ci porte pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment sur le point m\u00eame de la preuve en pareille mati\u00e8re et est sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e par les r\u00e8gles suivantes, venant du droit anglais, et applicables, suivant la d\u00e9cision de Mignault et Malo 41 \u00e0 l'examen de la validit\u00e9 d'un testament fait dans Qu\u00e9bec suivant la forme d\u00e9riv\u00e9e de la loi d'Angleterre. Ces r\u00e8gles, formul\u00e9es par le baron Parke, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment r\u00e9affirm\u00e9es par le comit\u00e9 judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans Harmes & others v. Hinkson 42. On le trouve \u00e0 la page 446:\u2014\n1\u00b0. The onus probandi lies in every case upon the party propounding a will; and he must satisfy the conscience of the Court that the instrument so propounded is the last will of a free and a capable testator and, 2\u00b0. if a party writes or prepares a will, under which he takes a benefit, that is a circumstance that ought generally to excite the suspicion of a Court and calls upon it to be vigilant and jealous in examining the evidence in support of the instrument in favour of which it ought not to pronounce unless the suspicion is removed and it is judicially satisfied that the paper propounded does express the true will of the deceased. Sans doute, ce testament avait \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 avant l'action mais ceci ne constitue par res judicata sur le point. (Dugas et Amyot 43).\nIl suffira d'ajouter que les faits, conditionnant le jeu de la r\u00e8gle en second lieu pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e dans Harmes & others v. Hinkson, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et prouv\u00e9s en la pr\u00e9sente cause. A la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, ce testament du 22 avril 1947 a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00e0 l'instigation de la personne qui en r\u00e9clame tout le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice, i.e., l'appelante, par son conseiller personnel, son prot\u00e9g\u00e9 et son oblig\u00e9, le mis-en-cause qui en a, d'ailleurs, \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire. Et la jurisprudence, r\u00e9affirmant en quelque sorte le principe qui per alium facit per seipsum facere videtur, affirme que la r\u00e8gle de preuve ci-dessus s'applique \u00e9galement en de telles circonstances.\nAutant de questions qui, dans mon humble opinion, affectent fondamentalement la d\u00e9cision de ce litige et qui, je le dis avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, ont \u00e9chapp\u00e9 \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration judiciaire en premi\u00e8re instance.\nSans qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire de relater au long tous les faits \u00e9tablis, il convient donc de consid\u00e9rer les circonstances imm\u00e9diatement contemporaines \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de ce testament, soit celles qui l'ont imm\u00e9diatement pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, ou suivi, comme celles qui l'ont accompagn\u00e9.\nD'abord, les rapports et relations entre Langlais, l'appelante et l'intim\u00e9e.\nEntre Langlais et l'intim\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9e est la fille de Langlais. Mari\u00e9e, elle est devenue et reste veuve avec un enfant. Financi\u00e8rement, elle a peu ou pas de moyens. Elle est son h\u00e9riti\u00e8re l\u00e9gale et elle et son fils sont ses h\u00e9ritiers naturels. Il est vrai qu'\u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de sa femme, que, pour des raisons non clairement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es mais de cons\u00e9quences non moins p\u00e9nibles, Langlais fut s\u00e9par\u00e9 de son enfant, l'intim\u00e9e, et, ce, pour une p\u00e9riode de trente-cinq ans. Qu'une r\u00e9conciliation, par voie de correspondance, ait \u00e9t\u00e9 acquise entre les deux, bien avant la date du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Madame Thivierge, le fait est probable. Il est nettement affirm\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e. Chose certaine, c'est qu'\u00e0 la premi\u00e8re opportunit\u00e9, subs\u00e9quente \u00e0 ce d\u00e9c\u00e8s, Langlais qui, pendant cette longue s\u00e9paration, gardait sur sa personne la photographie de sa fille et l'exhibait \u00e0 ses intimes, lui ouvre ses bras. D\u00e8s son arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec pour les fun\u00e9railles, il l'invite \u00e0 monter imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 la maison sachant bien, d'autre part, que l'appelante vient \u00e0 peine d'indiquer \u00e0 sa fille la volont\u00e9 de lui refuser l'entr\u00e9e de la maison.\nEntre Langlais et l'appelante. L'appelante est la s\u0153ur de Langlais. Elle n'est pas son h\u00e9riti\u00e8re naturelle, ni l\u00e9gale. Financi\u00e8rement, c'est une personne en moyens et, ce, avant m\u00eame le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Madame Thivierge. Elle vient, au surplus, elle-m\u00eame d'h\u00e9riter d'une fortune consid\u00e9rable.\nRien dans la preuve ne sugg\u00e8re aucune raison invitant Langlais \u00e0 la constituer son unique h\u00e9riti\u00e8re et, encore moins, et pour arriver \u00e0 ce faire, \u00e0 aller jusqu'\u00e0 d\u00e9sh\u00e9riter sa fille, aussi bien que son petit-fils.\nEntre l'appelante et l'intim\u00e9e. Les sentiments de la premi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'endroit de la seconde ne font aucun doute. Ils manifestent d'une hostilit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te et irr\u00e9ductible au point qu'aucun \u00e9v\u00e9nement, m\u00eame un d\u00e9c\u00e8s dans cette famille, aux membres limit\u00e9s\u2014\u00e9v\u00e9nement qui, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement et tout naturellement, favorise les r\u00e9conciliations entre tous les parents\u2014ne saurait faire tr\u00eave \u00e0 cette hostilit\u00e9. Elle d\u00e9fend m\u00eame l'entr\u00e9e de la maison \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e.\nTels sont les rapports et relations entre ces trois personnes au moment o\u00f9, quatre jours \u00e0 peine apr\u00e8s les fun\u00e9railles de Madame Thivierge, d\u00e9j\u00e0 s'ex\u00e9cute le document du 22 avril 1947, pour assurer la disposition des biens dont Langlais vient d'h\u00e9riter de cette derni\u00e8re.\nLa volont\u00e9, aussi bien que l'empressement de l'appelante de mettre la main sur l'h\u00e9ritage de Langlais est manifeste. Dans son esprit, ces biens appartiennent aux Langlais\u2014ce qui, pour elle, \u00e9limine l'intim\u00e9e\u2014et son fr\u00e8re, Firmin Langlais, n'a pas la libert\u00e9 d'en disposer \u00e0 son gr\u00e9.\nLanglais n'a pas, lui, \u00e0 ce temps, la volont\u00e9 de faire un testament. C'est bien l'appelante qui l'a pouss\u00e9 \u00e0 faire ce testament. Quant \u00e0 lui, c'est l'appelante elle-m\u00eame qui le rapporte, il disait: \"Des papiers, je ne veux pas en faire.\" \u2014\"Il le disait, de lui laisser la paix.\"\nDisons, en passant, que, d\u00e9j\u00e0, on avait obtenu de Langlais une procuration en faveur du mis-en-cause et, ce, sous le vain pr\u00e9texte de r\u00e9gler les affaires de la succession, dont le r\u00e8glement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9, par le testament de Madame Thivierge, \u00e0 un M. St-Pierre. Procuration qui, d'ailleurs, n'a jamais servi, sauf, peut-\u00eatre, comme en a conclu la Cour d'Appel, qu'\u00e0 jeter, avec les autres papiers qu'on a fait signer \u00e0 Langlais, de la confusion dans son esprit.\nPar une r\u00e9ponse en son t\u00e9moignage, le mis-en-cause semble sugg\u00e9rer que l'id\u00e9e du testament a germ\u00e9 chez Langlais, en affirmant que Langlais s'est inform\u00e9 si l'appelante avait fait un testament. Mais, dans une autre r\u00e9ponse, le m\u00eame t\u00e9moin nous dit que c'est lui qui, \"incidemment\" a inform\u00e9 Langlais du fait que l'appelante avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait son testament.\nDe toutes fa\u00e7ons, le t\u00e9moignage de l'appelante ne laisse aucun doute que c'est elle qui, nonobstant les dispositions clairement contraires de Langlais, a press\u00e9 ce dernier \u00e0 faire le testament par lequel elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie.\nSur les instructions donn\u00e9es par Langlais au mis-en-cause pour les fins de ce testament. D'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de ce dernier, Langlais aurait sans ambages d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il laissait tout \u00e0 l'appelante. Au cours de l'enqu\u00eate, on a demand\u00e9 au mis-en-cause pourquoi, \u00e0 son titre de conseiller, il n'avait pas attir\u00e9 l'attention de Langlais sur le fait qu'il d\u00e9sh\u00e9ritait sa fille. A cela, il r\u00e9pond, en substance, que ceci ne le regardait pas et qu'au surplus, il ignorait le fait que Langlais avait une fille et m\u00eame le fait qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mari\u00e9. La r\u00e9ponse surprend. Le mis-en-cause connaissait Langlais et Madame Thivierge depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, et l'appelante, depuis vingt-cinq ans. Mais, si tel est le cas et si, au moment de ces instructions donn\u00e9es par Langlais au mis-en-cause, ce dernier \u00e9tait encore ignorant du fait que Langlais avait une fille et un petit-fils, ce fait ne pouvait manquer de hanter l'esprit de l'appelante qui s'est bien gard\u00e9e de le d\u00e9voiler au mis-en-cause.\nSur l'ex\u00e9cution du testament. Du r\u00e9cit qu'en font les t\u00e9moins, on doit conclure que la c\u00e9r\u00e9monie fut tr\u00e8s br\u00e8ve. La version qu'ils en donnent d\u00e9montre que les formalit\u00e9s ext\u00e9rieures de la loi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 substantiellement suivies. Mais si, comme on l'a pr\u00e9tendu, Langlais avait, quelques jours \u00e0 peine auparavant, clairement et librement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire un testament et d'instituer l'appelante sa seule h\u00e9riti\u00e8re sans, au surplus, aucunement commenter sur le fait qu'il d\u00e9sh\u00e9ritait ainsi sa fille et son petit-fils, on peut se demander pourquoi, ainsi que le rapporte le t\u00e9moin, Ren\u00e9 Lachance, le mis-en-cause aurait dit \u00e0 Langlais avant la lecture du testament: \"Un testament, \u00e7a ne fait pas mourir.\" Et on peut se demander \u00e9galement pourquoi, au moment m\u00eame o\u00f9, la lecture termin\u00e9e, on invite Langlais \u00e0 signer, le mis-en-cause, toujours d'apr\u00e8s le m\u00eame t\u00e9moin, aurait dit \u00e0 Langlais \"que ceci ne l'obligeait \u00e0 rien et que, s'il voulait faire un autre testament, il \u00e9tait parfaitement libre d'annuler celui-l\u00e0 et d'en faire un autre en n'importe quel temps.\"\nPourquoi ces repr\u00e9sentations diminuant l'importance des cons\u00e9quences de cette signature recherch\u00e9e avec tant d'empressement par l'appelante? Ou bien, ces deux commentaires ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9s au mis-en-cause par des discussions, ou des repr\u00e9sentations faites ant\u00e9rieurement et que la preuve ne rapporte pas?\nMais les faits suivants sont prouv\u00e9s et non contredits, et, en cela, rendent cette cause singuli\u00e8re, car ce sont les actions et les paroles d'un t\u00e9moin essentiel \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de l'acte du 22 avril 1947, garde Ouellet, et du signataire lui-m\u00eame, Langlais, qui sont rapport\u00e9es.\nMoins de vingt minutes apr\u00e8s la signature du testament et d\u00e8s apr\u00e8s avoir quitt\u00e9 l'appelante et le mis-en-cause, Langlais monte \u00e0 la chambre de garde Ouellet. Cette derni\u00e8re est en quelque sorte de la famille. Elle en conna\u00eet tous les membres et, sans aucun doute, la nature de leurs relations respectives, aussi bien pass\u00e9es qu'actuelles. Elle vivait chez Madame Thivierge depuis douze ans. C'est l\u00e0 que Langlais se retirait durant ses voyages annuels \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. D\u00e9j\u00e0, elle, qui vient d'\u00eatre t\u00e9moin \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du testament, manifeste les appr\u00e9hensions qu'elle en a apport\u00e9es et demande \u00e0 Langlais: \"Savez-vous bien ce que vous venez de signer?\" Langlais lui-m\u00eame confirme ses appr\u00e9hensions par une r\u00e9ponse dont le sens naturel d\u00e9montre qu'il n'a pas r\u00e9alis\u00e9 avoir sign\u00e9 un testament. Il affirme, au contraire, avoir sign\u00e9 un tout autre document.\nQuelques jours plus tard, Langlais lui-m\u00eame encore, et, cette fois, de fa\u00e7on expresse, pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 un autre t\u00e9moin, l'abb\u00e9 Brochu, que ce n'est pas un testament qu'il a sign\u00e9 le 22 avril 1947, mais r\u00e9affirme qu'il s'agissait d'autres sortes de papiers. Inform\u00e9 par son ami, l'abb\u00e9 Brochu, que tel n'est pas le cas mais que c'est bien v\u00e9ritablement un testament qu'il a sign\u00e9 le 22 avril 1947, il en fait imm\u00e9diatement un autre r\u00e9voquant le premier, donnant tous ses biens \u00e0 sa fille, et confie ce document \u00e0 la garde de l'abb\u00e9 Brochu, entre les mains duquel il demeure pour une p\u00e9riode de plus d'un an.\nSans doute, ce testament olographe n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 l\u00e9galement, ne peut produire les effets juridiques qui lui sont propres. Rien n'emp\u00eache, cependant, mais tout commande, au contraire, qu'il soit tenu compte de tout l'incident comme circonstance qui, en la pr\u00e9sente cause, se rattache n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de la validit\u00e9 du premier.\nL'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 et la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de garde Ouellet et de l'abb\u00e9 Brochu sont av\u00e9r\u00e9es. Ni le Juge au proc\u00e8s, ni le dossier n'indiquent aucun motif d'en douter. L'examen minutieux de ces t\u00e9moignages confirme cette int\u00e9grit\u00e9 et cette cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Et la substance de ce qu'ils rapportent s'harmonise avec le poids de la preuve testimoniale admissible o\u00f9 apparaissent, de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante, l'existence et le maintien d'une volont\u00e9 chez Langlais bien oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 celle qui est exprim\u00e9e au document du 22 avril 1947.\nPour ces raisons, il faut tenir pour av\u00e9r\u00e9 que Langlais lui-m\u00eame a clairement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne s'\u00e9tait pas rendu compte qu'il signait un testament en signant le document du 22 avril 1947. C'est la preuve.\nEn faisant pareille d\u00e9claration, Langlais \u00e9tait-il sinc\u00e8re ou a-t-il, dans chacune des circonstances, \u00e0 l'endroit de garde Ouellet comme \u00e0 l'endroit de l'abb\u00e9 Brochu, et comme en faisant ce testament olographe dont il assura la conservation pendant plus d'un an, voulu simuler s'\u00eatre tromp\u00e9?\nSauf preuve au contraire, une personne est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e exprimer sa pens\u00e9e par ce qu'elle dit et sa volont\u00e9 v\u00e9ritable par ce qu'elle fait. La simulation ne se pr\u00e9sume pas. Elle doit donc \u00eatre prouv\u00e9e par celui qui l'invoque. Aussi bien, et sans la preuve des dires et actes de Langlais subs\u00e9quents \u00e0 la signature du document du 22 avril 1947, il serait difficile de ne pas tenir cet \u00e9crit comme exprimant et la pens\u00e9e et la volont\u00e9 de Langlais. Mais en la pr\u00e9sente cause, cette preuve existe. Et le sens ordinaire et naturel de ces d\u00e9clarations \u00e0 garde Ouellet et \u00e0 l'abb\u00e9 Brochu, et la port\u00e9e de l'acte qu'il a pos\u00e9 en faisant le second testament, sept jours \u00e0 peine apr\u00e8s le premier, est qu'il n'a pas compris, et n'a pas voulu faire le premier, celui du 22 avril 1947.\nOn veut \u00e9luder le sens naturel de la r\u00e9ponse de Langlais \u00e0 garde Ouellet en sugg\u00e9rant que le premier a voulu gentiment faire comprendre \u00e0 la seconde l'empertinence de sa question. Avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je dois dire que, dans mon humble opinion, c'est l\u00e0 une conjecture. Si, \u00e0 ce moment, Langlais avait v\u00e9ritablement la conscience d'avoir sign\u00e9 l'expression libre et voulue de ses derni\u00e8res volont\u00e9s, n'\u00e9tait-il pas \u00e9galement naturel pour lui de dissiper d\u00e8s lors les appr\u00e9hensions de garde Ouellet, ce t\u00e9moin essentiel \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'acte solennel qu'il venait, suivant la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelante, \u00e0 peine et volontairement de signer?\nLanglais a-t-il voulu, chez l'abb\u00e9 Brochu, simuler s'\u00eatre tromp\u00e9? Le r\u00e9cit que l'abb\u00e9 Brochu fait de cette visite ne sugg\u00e8re aucune simulation. Comment se justifier de la pr\u00e9sumer? L'abb\u00e9 Brochu visitait Madame Thivierge de son vivant. Il \u00e9tait visit\u00e9 par Langlais lors des visites de ce dernier \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. Il avait la confiance des deux. Rien n'indique que les paroles que Langlais a prononc\u00e9es dans ces circonstances n'aient pas fid\u00e8lement traduit sa pens\u00e9e. Et il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il s'\u00e9tait m\u00e9pris sur la nature du document du 22 avril 1947.\nMais on sugg\u00e8re que Langlais a voulu cacher le fait qu'il avait volontairement d\u00e9sh\u00e9rit\u00e9 sa fille par ce document. Mais, pourquoi cacher ce fait \u00e0 l'abb\u00e9 Brochu? Encore ici, c'est, je crois, une conjecture.\nIncidemment, on peut ajouter que l'appelante elle-m\u00eame, au proc\u00e8s, r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 ce testament du 22 avril 1947, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait: \"Oui, bien sign\u00e9, bien arrang\u00e9; c'est connu, \u00e7a.\" D\u00e9claration ayant un sens susceptible de parfaitement se r\u00e9concilier avec cette autre d\u00e9claration de Langlais \u00e0 sa fille, faite en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au m\u00eame document: \"On m'a jou\u00e9 un sale tour\u2026 .\"\nOn peut ajouter la preuve de toute une s\u00e9rie de circonstances prouv\u00e9es et ind\u00e9pendantes de ces d\u00e9clarations de Langlais et fournissant dans leur ensemble une cause plausible sinon certaine, comme en ont jug\u00e9 les Juges de la Cour d'Appel 44, de l'erreur affirm\u00e9e par Langlais. La preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas que Langlais souffrait d'ali\u00e9nation mentale, mais comment peut-on se justifier de l'avoir fait examiner, quelques jours \u00e0 peine apr\u00e8s la signature du premier testament, par un sp\u00e9cialiste en maladies mentales, \u00e0 moins que dans l'esprit de ceux qui ont provoqu\u00e9 ou concouru \u00e0 cet examen, Langlais ait pu, par sa conduite, ses agissements ou ses d\u00e9clarations, donner crainte \u00e0 ce sujet? Victime d'une h\u00e9morragie c\u00e9r\u00e9brale l'automne pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, fatigu\u00e9 par de r\u00e9cents et longs voyages, atterr\u00e9 par la mort d'une s\u0153ur qu'il aimait particuli\u00e8rement et qui lui t\u00e9moignait de toutes fa\u00e7ons de l'affection, affect\u00e9 sans aucun doute par le retour de sa seule enfant qu'il n'avait vue depuis trente-cinq ans, autant de circonstances qui, ajout\u00e9es au poids de son \u00e2ge, \u00e9taient susceptibles de jeter, \u00e0 certains moments, quelque confusion dans son esprit.\nEn somme, je dois conclure que la preuve n'\u00e9tablit pas que Langlais ait simul\u00e9, mais indique, par pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance, qu'il \u00e9tait sinc\u00e8re quand, dans les quelques minutes, aussi bien que dans les quelques jours apr\u00e8s l'ex\u00e9cution du document du 22 avril 1947, il a affirm\u00e9 n'en avoir pas r\u00e9alis\u00e9 la port\u00e9e, et, comme les membres de la Cour d'Appel, je ne puis dire que cet \u00e9crit a re\u00e7u l'adh\u00e9sion libre d'une volont\u00e9 \u00e9clair\u00e9e.\nJe renverrais le pr\u00e9sent appel, maintiendrais le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi si\u00e9geant en appel, et r\u00e9affirmerais les conclusions du jugement formel de cette derni\u00e8re Cour; le tout avec d\u00e9pens des trois Cours.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Letarte & Ferland.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Pr\u00e9vost, Gagn\u00e9 & Flynn.\n1 (1872) L.R. 4 P.C. 123.\n2 Q.R.

The appellants, holders of an air transport license from the Air Transport Board of Canada, secured an option on land within the respondent municipality for the purpose of a licensed air strip. Before the transaction was completed the respondent under authority of s. 921 passed a by-law prohibiting the establishment of an aerodrome within that part of the municipality in which the optioned lands were situate.\nHeld: The subject of aeronautics is within the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament consequently section 921 of The Municipal Act and the by-law in question passed thereunder are ultra vires.\nIn re The Regulation and Control of Aeronautics in Canada [1932] A.C. 54; In re Regulation and Control of Radio Communication in Canada [1932] A.C. 304; Attorney General for Ontario v.

P. Varcoe K.C., A. G. Eggertson, K.C. and D. W. Mundell, K.C. for the Attorney General of Canada, Intervenant. The trial judge erred in holding that the authority of Parliament in relation to \"aeronautics\" arose only under s. 132 of the B.N.A. Act. He and the judges in the majority in the Court of Appeal erred in holding (a) that control of the selection or location of aerodromes and the rights of persons to engage in aeronautical activities are not part of the subject matter of \"aeronautics\" within the authority of Parliament and outside s. 92; (b) that even if these are within the subject matter of \"aeronautics\" the legislature of a province may legislate in relation to them from the aspect of property and civil rights and the legislation will be operative so long as it is not overridden by federal legislation; (c) that s. 921 is not overridden by the Aeronautics Act.\nS. 921 of The Municipal Act, R.S.M. 1940, c. 141 is ultra vires. If a provincial statute is not authorized under any legislative head of s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act, (or ss. 93 and 95 not relevant here), then it is ultra vires. Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons 3. S. 921 is not legislation in relation to \"Municipal Institutions,\" but to a power of control and regulation conferred on them. It is not legislation in relation to any other head in s. 92. The decision in the Aeronautics Reference, 4 that Parliament may enact legislation in relation to \"aeronautics\" is a decision that as a legislative subject matter \"aeronautics\" does not fall in s. 92. The heads of s. 92 must, therefore, be interpreted as not including any part of \"aeronautics\" within the enumeration in s. 91. John Deere Plow Co. Ltd. v. Wharton 5; Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King 6 ; A.G. of Alta. v. A.G. of Can. (Debt Adjustment case), 7; A. G. of Can. v. A.G. of Que. (Bank Deposits Case) 8; Postal Reference 9. Further, since it was held that Parliament's authority also rests on the opening words of s. 91, this is a decision that the subject matter \"aeronautics\" as a whole falls outside s. 92 since authority to legislate under these words is \"in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces\". Moreover, it was expressly stated that \"aeronautics\" does not fall within either head 13 or head 16. Further, as a matter of fact, \"aeronautics\" as a subject matter of legislation is clearly one that from its inherent nature is of national concern Re Canada Temperance Act 10. Control and regulation of the use of the air for transportation and control of the earth's surface for the use of the air for transportation is indivisible. Regulation for local purposes cannot be separated from regulation for the purposes of the heads of s. 91 or for interprovincial or international purposes, which are clearly of national concern. The Attorney General also relies on the judgments of the judges in the Court of Appeal that \"aeronautics\" is a subject matter for which Parliament may legislate under s. 91. Since \"aeronautics\" is a subject matter on which Parliament can legislate it falls outside s. 92 and the authority of the province. S. 921 must therefore be outside the authority of the Legislature of Manitoba since it is legislation in relation to the subject matter of \"aeronautics\". To ascertain the \"matter\" in relation to which legislation is enacted, regard must be had to the \"pith and substance\" or \"the true nature and character\" of the legislation. To determine this, regard is to be had to the effect and the object or purpose of the legislation. The question is\u2014At what subject matter is the legislation \"aimed\" or \"directed\"? A.G. of Ont. v. Reciprocal Insurers 11; A.G. for Alta. v. A.G. for Canada (Bank Taxation case) 12; A.G. for Can. v. A.G. for Que. (Bank Deposits case) 13. The purpose and effect of s. 921 are to control and regulate the use of part of the surface of the earth for the landing and taking off of aircraft and to abrogate rights and liberties of persons to use their property for aeronautical activities. It is, therefore, directed at \"aeronautics\". These are matters that fall within \"aeronautics\". It was so held in the Aeronautics Reference. Moreover, apart from authority, \"aeronautics\" must necessarily include control of use of the earth's surface in connection with the use of the air and of rights of persons for such purposes and the control and regulation of the use of the air and of the means of using it as a mode of transport. Control in every respect of the places where airplanes may land and take off, including the location of such places, is quite as essential a part of the control of aeronautics as control of where and the conditions under which airplanes may fly. In legal terms, this means that Parliament may legislate to vary or abrogate existing rights, powers or liberties or to create new rights, powers or liberties with respect to the ownership or operation of aircraft in the air or on the ground with respect to the use of property in connection with the operation of aircraft and aeronautical activities. This is the legal content of the subject matter \"aeronautics\". It follows that these rights, powers and liberties are not within the rights of \"Property\" and \"Civil Rights\" in the Province as these terms are used in s. 92. The trial judge and the judges in the majority in the Court of Appeal erred in holding that control of the location of aerodromes is not included in the subject matter \"aeronautics\" and in holding that the use of property for an airport is a \"Civil Right\" in the Province that falls in s. 92. The Provincial Legislature cannot enact legislation to control or regulate for any purpose the use of the earth's surface for aeronautical activities or the rights and liberties of persons to engage in aeronautical activities even though it might appear that the legislation is enacted from an aspect other than \"aeronautics\". Such legislation deals with an essential part of the subject matter \"aeronautics\". It is therefore wholly outside s. 92. Postal Reference 14. The judges in the court below erred in holding that control of locations for airports or of the right to use property for airports is not an essential part of the subject matter \"aeronautics\". Even if s. 921 could be enacted by the Legislature from some aspect other than aeronautics, it is overridden by s. 4 of the Aeronautics Act, which is valid federal legislation. A.G. for Alta. v. A.G. for Can. (Debt Adjustment Reference) 15 since s. 921 confers power to obstruct and interfere with the powers conferred by s. 4 of the Aeronautics Act. The judges in the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the powers conferred by s. 921 are not overridden by s. 4. They relied on cases where it had been held that there might be a dual requirement under provincial and federal legislation for obtaining licenses. In such cases, however, the licenses were not directed at exercising a control for the same purpose or to achieve the same effects, but were required for different purposes and the discretions, if any, to grant or refuse the licenses involved different considerations. The Aeronautics Act and the Regulations made pursuant to its authority are valid federal legislation, within the authority of Parliament in relation to the subject matter \"aeronautics\". Even if Parliament had no authority in relation to \"aeronautics\" as a subject matter outside of s. 92, the Aeronautics Act is valid legislation for the carrying out of the International Civil Aviation Convention of 1944. Parliament has authority to carry out this Convention under s. 91. Radio Reference 16. Conventions of this kind, including the International Civil Aviation Convention, are distinguishable from the very exceptional type of conventions under consideration in the Labour Conventions Reference 17. The International Civil Aviation Convention, falls under the decision in the Radio Reference. Parliament has, therefore, legislative authority to carry out its terms. This being so, the Aeronautics Reference is an authority showing that the Aeronautics Act is within Parliament's authority to carry out the Convention.\nC. I. Keith K.C. for the appellants. The importance of this appeal is that the power to prohibit the creation of aerodromes which the judgment appealed from holds is possessed by the Province of Manitoba will be a serious obstacle to the development of aeronautics if allowed to stand, and particularly if similar legislation is passed by the other provinces. It has been assumed that the effect of the judgment in the Aeronautics Reference (supra) was to place every phase of aeronautics as dealt with in the Aeronautics Act in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. On no reported judgment prior to this case has doubt been cast on this conclusion and in at least three subsequent judgments of the Privy Council, it has been commented on as having this effect. The Radio case, the Labour case and the Canada Temperance Federation case (supra). Once it is acknowledged that aeronautics is within the exclusive power of Parliament, the principles which have been applied to railways within the Dominion jurisdiction are applicable to the subject of aeronautics. C.P.R. v. Notre Dame de Bonsecours Parish 18. The appellants rely generally on the dissenting judgment of Coyne J.A. and the authorities there cited.\nW. J. Johnston, K.C. for the Attorney General of Manitoba, Intervenant. There are two points in issue (a) Does the decision in the Aeronautics Reference 19 place the subject of aeronautics in all its aspects within the legislative competence of the Dominion? (b) Assuming that such is the case, is the Province precluded from enacting and enforcing zoning regulations with respect to the location of airports? Coyne J.A. in his dissenting judgment 20 erred in finding that the Aeronautics Reference placed the subject matter of aeronautics solely and exclusively within the legislative competence of the Dominion. The correct interpretation is to be found in the judgment of the trial judge, Campbell J. 21\u2014In the alternative, even if the Dominion derives legislative power from sources other than s. 132 it is not such a power as would preclude the Province from dealing with the location of airports as a zoning regulation since that could hardly be classed as legislation on aerial navigation. The Intervenant relies upon the reasons of Dysart and Adamson J.J.A. concurred in by McPherson C.J.M. and Richards J.A. 20 and submits that the appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Aeronautics case goes no further than to hold that the Dominion's power to pass the aeronautics legislation then under review was derived from s. 132 of the B.N.A. Act and not under an express delegation of legislative power over the subject \"aeronautics.\" The Province relies upon subsequent decisions of the Privy Council in which the judgment in the Aeronautics case has been explained and clarified. The first case was the Radio case 22. The judgment delivered by Viscount Dunedin, a member of the Board in the Aeronautics case, gave the chief ground of the decision in the latter case as s. 132 of the B.N.A. Act. In A.G. Can. v. A.G. Ont 23 (Reference re labour legislation). Lord Atkin, a member of the Board in the Aeronautics case, also confined it to s. 132 (pp. 350 A.C.; p. 309 W.W.R.). In the Labour Legislation Reference the conventions under review were made by Canada under its new status as a Sovereign State and s. 132, which relates to treaties made by Great Britain, did not apply. It was therefore contended by the Dominion that the subject matter of the legislation had become one of national concern and, in support of the contention, the Radio and Aeronautics cases were relied on. The contention was rejected by the Board, (p. 352 A.C. and p. 311 W.W.R.). In Reference re Natural Products Marketing Act, 24 accepted as the locus classicus on the \"peace, order and good government\" clause, Duff, C.J.C. at p. 425 pointed out that the Aeronautics case did not hold that the Dominion's jurisdiction over aeronautics came within the above clause. In making this submission the decision in A.G. Ont. v. Canada Temperance Federation 25 where a casual reference is made to the decisions in the Aeronautics and Radio cases, has not been overlooked. The legislation there under review was the Canada Temperance Act as re-enacted in 1924. The original 1878 Statute was considered by the Privy Council in Russell v. The Queen, 26 and upheld under the \"peace, order and good government\" clause as being legislation, the subject matter of which had attained national concern as affecting the body politic of the nation. The Canada Temperance Act survived on the pronouncement in the Russell case and its constitutional validity was not again challenged until the Temperance Federation case. While the Russell case has stood as the basis for Dominion competence in the temperance field, the reasoning behind the decision based on the \"peace, order and good government\" clause has undergone a marked change in subsequent judgments of the Board. The Board of Commerce case 27; Snider's case 28. The Temperance case cannot be considered as over-ruling the well established principles on the interpretation of the \"peace, order and good government\" clause. The present interpretation to be placed on that clause still remains the pronouncement of Lord Atkin previously referred to in A.G. Can. v. A.G. Ont. at pp. 352-3. The law on that matter as pronounced by Duff C.J. and adopted by Lord Atkin is to be found in the Marketing Act case 29 that, except in those instances where the subject matter of legislation has under extraordinary circumstances acquired aspects of such paramount significance as to take it into the national field, the \"peace, order and good government\" clause can have no application in a field assigned exclusively to the Province under s. 92. The clause can usurp the provincial field only where the subject matter is one of paramount national importance or in case of emergency. Lord Atkin's pronouncement was adopted and reaffirmed as late as 1949 in C.P.R. v. A.G. of B.C. 30.\nThe effect of the decision in the Aeronautics case is to give to the Dominion an overriding power to enact such legislation as may be necessary to fulfill an obligation under the Aerial Navigation Treaty and hence to encroach on the Provincial Legislative field for such purpose. The grounds of the decision having been reduced to this single proposition it can no longer be taken to have overruled the judgment of the Supreme Court 31 insofar as the judges of that Court may have assigned legislative jurisdiction to the Dominion or to the Provinces.\nThe Dominion's power to license and regulate airports cannot be supported as incidental or ancillary to any of the enumerated heads of s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act. Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway 32; L'Union St. Jacques de Montreal v. Belisle 33. Even assuming that licensing and regulation of commercial airports is incidental or ancillary to the legislative power of the Dominion under s. 132; as licensing and regulation of airports, particularly with respect to location, clearly falls within s. 92 the double aspect rule will apply and unless the Dominion has occupied the field, provincial legislation is competent. A.G. Ont. v. A.G. Can. 34; Forbes v. A.G. Man. 35. Under s. 4 of the Aeronautics Act regulations have been passed relating to airports, (See Part II of Air Regulations 1948), but the Dominion has not occupied the field in so far as location of airports is concerned and in so far as it has dealt with licensing and regulation of airports, it has not exceeded the limited power referred to by Duff J. in his judgment in [1930] S.C.R. 663 at 690. The licensing and regulatory provisions of the Regulations are merely to enforce compliance with those regulations which have been enacted to carry out treaty obligations and are not an occupation of the whole field to the exclusion of the Province.\nS. 921 of The Municipal Act which deals with location does not clash with Dominion legislation in respect to licensing and regulation. It has not been superseded by Dominion legislation and is therefore valid and existing legislation under the Province's licensing powers contained in s. 92(9), raising revenue, and as ancillary to its legislative powers under s. 92 (13), property and civil rights, and 92(16), matters of local interest. Hodge v. The Queen 36; R. v. Cherry 37; Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board 38.\nAssuming that the Dominion has jurisdiction over the subject of aeronautics generally by virtue of the \"peace, order and good government\" clause, the Province is not precluded from enacting s. 921, since in pith and substance it is nothing more than a zoning regulation, within the legislative competence of the Province under 92(13), property and civil rights, or 92(16), matters of local or private nature.\nUnder the \"peace, order and good government\" clause the Dominion derives legislative power under two propositions: 1. That matter is not within any of the enumerated heads of s. 92; or 2. That the matter has attained such paramount national importance as to affect the body politic of the nation. Leaving aside the question of aeronautics generally and dealing only with the subject matter of s. 921, what is there dealt with is directly within 92(13) or (16) and the Dominion could therefore acquire no authority under the first proposition. Dealing with the second proposition, jurisdiction under it can arise only when Parliament has legislated on a matter and thus by inference indicated that it has acquired such proportions as to be of paramount national importance. Therefore, where there is no Dominion legislation and the matter is otherwise within s. 92, provincial legislation must be intra vires. McLean v. Pettigrew 39, per Taschereau J. at 79.\nThat a particular operation is subject to Dominion control does not mean that it is never subject to provincial legislation. Both may legislate on the same subject matter in different aspects and so long as there is no clash both may stand side by side. Hodge v. The Queen 40; Reg. v. Wason 41; G.T.R. v. A.G. Can. 42; R. v. Magid 43.\nS. 921 of The Municipal Act is legislation which in pith and substance is zoning regulation and hence a local matter dealing with property and civil rights. It is not in pith and substance legislation on aerial navigation.\nW. P. Fillmore, K.C. for the Respondent. The respondent relies upon the judgment of the trial judge and the majority judgments in the Court of Appeal. There is nothing in the Aeronautics Act or in the Regulations, or in the Convention discussed in the Aeronautics case, which either expressly or by necessary implication takes away or restricts the right of the Province to authorize a local body to pass by-laws relating to health or safety or any other matter of a local or private nature which is a proper subject of municipal by-law. Encroachment on provincial rights in this case cannot be justified as a measure of peace, order or good government in Canada or otherwise.\nThe Minister may exercise the widest control over aerial navigation and the licensing, inspection and regulation of aerodromes consistently with the right of the Province to designate where they may or may not be located. In any event until the Dominion invades this field a Province may continue to do so. It cannot be assumed by the Court that a municipality would pass by-laws in bad faith or with an ulterior motive. A.G. for Ont. v. A.G. for Can. 44; City of Montreal v. Beauvais 45; Stengel v. Crandon et al 46, (Florida S.C. 1945), annotation at p. 1232.\nThe questions involved in this appeal are to a certain extent academic in that the appellants had not obtained a license from the Minister, and the Minister might not grant a license where the aerodrome is located in defiance of local by-laws. The Aeronautics Act does not purport to give any person or company the right to locate an airport in breach of local by-laws. Assuming that the Dominion has ample power in this regard, it has not exercised the power. In the case of railways the Railway Act gives the railway power, subject to the approval of the Board of Transport Commissioners, to locate the line of a railway and to expropriate property. In City of Toronto v. Bell Telephone Co. 47, it was held that the scope of the respondent's business contemplated by the Act involved its extension beyond the limits of any one province, and was therefore within the express exception made by s. 92(10) (a) of the B.N.A. Act from the class of local works and undertakings assigned thereby to provincial legislatures. It is obvious from the facts here that the aerodrome contemplated by the appellants is designed and is only suitable for operations of a very local and private nature.\nAs the constitutional problems and cases are carefully reviewed in the appeal of the A.G. for Manitoba the respondent will not cover that ground.\nThe Dominion has not invaded, and cannot, and need not, invade the whole field: The Provincial Secretary v. Egan 48; Reference re Validity of s. 31 of the (Alta.) Municipal District Act Amendment Act, 1941 49. There is nothing in the Aeronautics Act or the Regulations which intereferes with provincial jurisdiction over property and civil rights or matters of a local or private nature in the province. The right of the Province to legislate in respect of zoning regulations is also an exercise of the right of control over municipal institutions in the province. Ladore v. Bennett 50; The King v. Eastern Terminal Elevator Co. 51; Reference re Dairy Industries Act 52.\nVarcoe K.C. and Keith K.C. replied.\nThe Chief Justice\u2014Notwithstanding that the International Convention under consideration in the Aeronautics case 53, was denounced by the Government of Canada as of April 4, 1947, I entertain no doubt that the decision of the Judicial Committee is in its pith and substance that the whole field of aerial transportation comes under the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament. In the language of their Lordships at p. 77:\u2014\nAerial navigation is a class of subject which has attained such dimensions as to affect the body politic of the Dominion.\nIn those circumstances it would not matter that Parliament may not have occupied the field. But, moreover, the convention on International Civil Aviation, signed at Chicago on December 7, 1944, has since become effective; and what was said in the Radio Reference 54 by Viscount Dunedin at p. 313, applies here. Although the convention might not be looked upon as a treaty under s. 132 of the British North America Act, \"it comes to the same thing\".\nI fail however to see how it can be argued that the Dominion Parliament has not occupied the field. The Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 3, as amended by c. 28 of the Statutes of 1944-45, c. 9 of the Statutes of 1945, and c. 23 of the statutes of 1950, makes it the duty of the Minister \"to supervise all matters connected with aeronautics * * * to prescribe aerial routes * * * to prepare such regulations as may be considered necessary for the control or operation of aeronautics in Canada * * * and for the control or operation of aircraft registered in Canada wherever such aircraft may be * * * for the licensing of navigation and the regulation of all aerodromes and air-stations, etc.\"\nSuch regulations have been passed under the authority of the Aeronautics Act by P.C. 2129, part of which deals with the subject matter of airports and provides for the issuing of licenses by the Minister. In the circumstances, the Dominion legislation occupies the field, or at least so much of it as would eliminate any provincial legislation, and, more particularly, that here in question.\nI think, therefore, that the provincial legislation under discussion is ultra vires and the by-law adopted by the respondent, the Rural Municipality of West St. Paul, falls with it. The appeal, therefore, should be allowed with costs in this Court against the respondent, but without costs to either intervenant. As the parties had agreed that there would be no costs awarded in the Courts below, this agreement, of course, should stand.\nKerwin J. :\u2014This is an appeal by Mr. and Mrs. Johannesson against a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba affirming an order of Campbell J. dismissing their application for an order declaring that s. 921 of The Municipal Act, R.S.M. 1940, c. 141, was ultra vires as not being within the legislative competence of the Legislature, and that by-law 292 of the rural municipality of West St. Paul, passed May 27, 1948, in pursuance of such section, was, therefore, null and void.\nSection 921 of The Municipal Act appears in Division II \"Public Safety and Amenity\" under the sub-head \"Aerodromes\" and reads as follows:\n921. Any municipal corporation may pass by-laws for licensing, regulating, and, within certain defined areas, preventing the erection, maintenance and continuance of aerodromes or places where aeroplanes are kept for hire or gain.\nThis section first appeared in 1920, being enacted by s. 18 of c. 82 of the statutes of that year as paragraph (y) of s. 612 of The Municipal Act, R.S.M. 1913, c. 133. That s. 612 was one of a group of sections appearing in Part IX of the Act \"Legislative Powers of Councils\", under the sub-head \"Various Trades and Occupations.\" It next appeared in s. 97 of the Consolidated Amendments to the Municipal Act, 1924, and then, in 1933, as s. 910 in Division II of The Municipal Act, 1933, c. 57, \"Public Safety and Amenity\" under the sub-head \"Aerodromes\" the same relevant position that the present s. 921 now occupies.\nThe enacting parts of By-law No. 292 of the rural municipality of West St. Paul provide :\n1. No aerodrome or place where aeroplanes are kept for hire or gain shall be erected or maintained or continued within that part of The Rural Municipality of West St. Paul, in Manitoba, bounded as follows: All those portions of River Lots One (1) to Thirty-three (33) both inclusive, of the Parish of Saint Paul, in Manitoba, according to a plan of same registered in the Winnipeg Land Titles Office as No. 3992, which lie to the East of the Eastern Limit of the Main Highway as said Highway is shewn on said Plan No. 3992. 2. No aerodrome or place where aeroplanes are kept for hire or gain shall be erected or maintained or continued in any other part of the said Rural Municipality of West St. Paul, unless and until a license therefor shall first have been obtained from the said Municipality.\n3. No building or installation of any machine shop for the testing and\/or repairing of air-craft shall be erected or maintained or continued in that part of The Rural Municipality of West St. Paul in Manitoba described in paragraph One (1) hereof.\n4. No building or installation of any machine shop for the testing and\/or repairing of air-craft shall be erected or maintained or continued in any other part of the said Municipality unless and until a license therefor shall first have been obtained from the said Municipality.\nSection 921 of The Municipal Act does not confer powers to provide generally for zoning, or for building restrictions; the powers are specifically allotted with reference to \"aerodromes or any places where aeroplanes are kept for hire or gain.\" The by-law follows the section so that, if the latter is ultra vires the Provincial Legislature, the former cannot be upheld.\nThe circumstances which give rise to the present dispute are important as showing the far-reaching effect of the provisions of the section. The appellant Johannesson had been engaged in commercial aviation since 1928 and held an air transport licence, issued by the Air Transport Board of Canada, to operate an air service at Winnipeg and Flin Flon. The charter service which he operated under this licence covers territory in central and northern Manitoba and northern Saskatchewan, and had substantially increased in volume over the years. This service was operated with light and medium weight planes, which in the main were equipped in summer with floats and in winter with skis in order to permt landing on the numerous lakes and rivers in this territory, and these planes had to be repaired and serviced in Winnipeg, which was the only place within the territory where the necessary supplies and any facilities were available for that purpose. The use by small planes of a large airfield, such as Stevenson Airport near Winnipeg which was maintained for the use of large transcontinental airplanes, was impractical and would eventually be prohibited. No facilities existed on the Red River in Winnipeg for the repairing and servicing of planes equipped with floats, and repairs could only be made to such planes by dismantling them at some private dock and transporting them, by truck, through Winnipeg to Stevenson Airport. After a long search by Johannesson in the suburbs of Winnipeg for a site that would combine an area of level land of sufficient area and dimensions and location to comply with the regulations of the Civil Aviation Branch of the Canadian Department of Transport relating to a licensed air strip with access to a straight stretch of the Red River of sufficient length to be suitable for the landing of airplanes equipped with floats, he found such a location (but one only) in the rural municipality of West St. Paul and acquired an option to purchase it but, before the transaction was completed By-law 292 was passed. Title to the land was subsequently taken in the name of both appellants and these proceedings ensued. The Attorney General of Canada and the Attorney General of Manitoba were notified but only the latter was represented before the judge of first instance and the Court of Appeal. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the latter.\nOn behalf of the appellants and the Attorney General of Canada, reliance is placed upon the decision of the Judicial Committee in the Aeronautics case 55.. Irrespective of later judicial comments upon this case, in my view it is a decision based entirely upon the fact that the Dominion Aeronautics Act there in question had been enacted pursuant to an International Convention of 1919 to which the British Empire was a party and, therefore, within s. 132 of the British North America Act, 1867:\n132. The Parliament and Government of Canada shall have all Powers necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada or of any Province thereof, as part of the British Empire, towards foreign countries arising under treaties between the Empire and such foreign countries.\nHowever, in the subsequent decision in the Labour Conventions case (A.G. for Canada v. A.G. for Ontario 56), Lord Atkin, who had been a member of the Board in the Aeronautics case, said with reference to the judgment therein:\nThe Aeronautics case 57 concerned legislation to perform obligations imposed by a treaty between the Empire and foreign countries. Sect. 132, therefore, clearly applied, and but for a remark at the end of the judgment, which in view of the stated ground of the decision was clearly obiter, the case could not be said to be an authority on the matter now under discussion. The remarks of Viscount Simon in A.G. for Ontario v. Canada Temperance Federation 58, must be read when considering the words of Lord Sankey in the Aeronautics case in another connection. At the moment all I am concerned with emphasizing is that the Aeronautics case decided one thing, and one thing only, and that is that the matter there discussed fell within the ambit of s. 132 of the British North America Act.\nAt this stage it is necessary to refer to a matter that was not explained to the Courts below. According to a certificate from the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Convention of 1919 was denounced by Canada, which denunciation became effective in 1947. This was done because on February 13, 1947, Canada had deposited its Instrument of Ratification of the Convention on International Civil Aviation signed at Chicago December 8, 1944, and which Convention came into force on April 4, 1947. With the exception of certain amendments that are not relevant to the present discussion, the Aeronautics Act remains on the statute books of Canada in the same terms as those considered by the Judicial Committee in the Aeronautics case. Section 132 of the B.N.A. Act, therefore ceased to have any efficacy to permit Parliament to legislate upon the subject of aeronautics.\nNevertheless the fact remains that the Convention of 1919 was a treaty between the Empire and foreign countries and that pursuant thereto the Aeronautics Act was enacted. It continues as c. 3 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, as amended. Under s. 4 of that Act, as it stood when these proceedings were commenced, the Minister, with the approval of the Governor in Council, had power to regulate and control aerial navigation over Canada and the territorial waters of Canada, and in particular but not to restrict the generality of the foregoing, he might make regulations with respect to * * * (c) the licensing, inspection and regulation of all aerodromes and air stations. Pursuant thereto regulations have been promulgated dealing with many of the matters mentioned in the section, including provisions for the licensing of air ports. If, therefore, the subject of aeronautics goes beyond local or provincial concern because it has attained such dimensions as to affect the body politic of Canada, it falls under the \"Peace, Order and Good Government\" clause of s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act since aeronautics is not a subject-matter confined to the provinces by s. 92. It does not fall within head 8, \"Municipal Institutions\", as that head \"simply gives the provincial legislature the right to create a legal body for the management of municipal affairs * * * The extent and nature of the functions\" the provincial legislature \"can commit to a municipal body of its own creation must depend upon the legislative authority which it derives from the provisions of s. 92 other than No. 8\": Attorney General for Ontario v. Attorney General for Canada 59. Nor, on the authority of the same decision is it within head 9: \"shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer, and other licences in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial, local, or municipal purposes.\" Once it is held that the subject-matter transcends \"Property and Civil Rights in the Province\" (head 13) or \"Generally all matters of a merely local or private nature in the Province\" (head 16), these two heads of s. 92 have no relevancy.\nNow, even at the date of the Aeronautics case, the Judicial Committee was influenced (i.e. in the determination of the main point) by the fact that in their opinion the subject of air navigation was a matter of national interest and importance and had attained such dimensions. That that is so at the present time is shown by the terms of the Chicago Convention of 1944 and the provisions of the Dominion Aeronautics Act and the regulations thereunder referred to above. The affidavit of the appellant Johannesson, from which the statement of facts was culled, also shows the importance that the subject of air navigation has attained in Canada. To all of which may be added those matters of everyday knowledge of which the Court must be taken to be aware.\nIt is with reference to this phase of the matter that Viscount Simon's remarks in A.G. for Canada v. Canada Temperance Federation 60, must be read. What was there under consideration was the Canada Temperance Act, originally enacted in 1878, and Viscount Simon stated: \"In their Lordships' opinion, the true test must be found in the real subject matter of the legislation: if it is such that it goes beyond local or provincial concern or interests and must from its inherent nature be the concern of the Dominion as a whole (as, for example, in the Aeronautics case 61 and the Radio case 62, then it will fall within the competence of the Dominion Parliament as a matter affecting the peace, order and good government of Canada, though it may in another aspect touch on matters specially reserved to the provincial legislatures.\" This statement is significant because, while not stating that the Aeronautics case was a decision on the point, it is a confirmation of the fact that the Board in the Aeronautics case considered that the subject of aeronautics transcended provincial legislative boundaries.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the orders below set aside, and judgment should be entered declaring s. 921 of the Act ultra vires and By-law 292 of the rural municipality of West St. Paul null and void. By agreement there are to be no costs in the Courts below but the appellants are entitled to their costs in this Court against the municipality. There should be no order as to costs for or against either intervenant.\nThe judgment of Kellock and Cartwright, JJ. was delivered by:\nKellock J.:\u2014The question in this appeal is as to the constitutional validity of the following section of The Municipal Act, R.S.M. 1940, c. 141, namely,\n921. Any municipal corporation may pass by-laws for licensing, regulating, and, within certain definite areas, preventing the erection, maintenance and continuance of aerodromes or places where aeroplanes are kept for hire or gain.\nPurporting to act under this legislation, the respondent municipality enacted a by-law prohibiting aerodromes in a defined area in the municipality and permitting aerodromes elsewhere in the municipality only upon license. The appellant, who holds an air transport license issued by the Air Transport Board of Canada to operate an air service at both the City of Winnipeg and the town of Flin Flon, has been operating a charter aeroplane service in Manitoba and Saskatchewan for some years, using mainly float and ski planes. For the purposes of his business, the appellant acquired an area in the respondent municipality having access to a stretch of the Red River. These premises were acquired having in view the requirements of the Department of Transport with respect to aerodromes, and it was subsequent to the appellant's acquisition that the by-law in question was passed. The appellant's motion for an order declaring the above legislation and by-law ultra vires was dismissed by the judge of first instance, and this order was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, Coyne J. A. dissenting.\nIn this court, we were informed on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada that the convention under consideration in the Aeronautics case 63, was denounced by the Government of Canada as of April 4, 1947, on which date also the convention on International Civil Aviation, signed at Chicago on December 7, 1944, became effective. Insofar, therefore, as the above decision depends for efficacy upon s. 132 of the British North America Act, that foundation has ceased to exist.\nIn the Aeronautics case, the Privy Council held that the \"whole field of legislation in regard to aerial navigation belongs to the Dominion\" by virtue of s. 132, s. 91 heads 2, 5 and 7, and the residuary power in s. 91 to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada. Their Lordships expressed the view also, at p. 73, that aeronautics was not a class of subject within property and civil rights, and at p. 77, that it was not a subject vested by specific words in the provinces. On the latter page, their Lordships went on to say:\nFurther, their Lordships are influenced by the facts that the subject of aerial navigation and the fulfilment of Canadian obligations under s. 132 are matters of national interest and importance; and that aerial navigation is a class of subject which has attained such dimensions as to affect the body politic of the Dominion.\nIt is true, as the judgment itself shows, and as later pronouncements of the judicial committee have repeated, that s. 132 was the leading consideration in the judgment. In the Radio Reference 64, the convention there in question was not one to which s. 132 was applicable, but, as pointed out by Lord Atkin in 1937 A.C. at p. 351, that convention dealt with classes of matters which did not fall within s. 92 but entirely within subject matters of Dominion jurisdiction under s. 91. In these circumstances, their Lordships said in the Radio case that, although the convention there in question was not such a treaty as fell within s. 132, it came to the same thing. At p. 313 Viscount Dunedin said:\nThe result is in their Lordships' opinion clear. It is Canada as a whole which is amenable to the other powers for the proper carrying out of the convention; and to prevent individuals in Canada infringing the stipulations of the convention it is necessary that the Dominion should pass legislation which should apply to all the dwellers in Canada.\nTo the extent, therefore, to which the subject matter of the Chicago convention of 1944 falls within s. 91, the language of Viscount Dunedin is equally apt. In my opinion, that subject matter is exclusively within Dominion jurisdiction.\nIn my opinion, the subject of aerial navigation in Canada is a matter of national interest and importance, and was so held in 1932. In the Canada Temperance Federation case 65, Viscount Simon said at p. 205:\nIn their Lordships' opinion, the true test must be found in the real subject matter of the legislation: if it is such that it goes beyond local or provincial concern or interests and must from its inherent nature be the concern of the Dominion as a whole (as, for example, in the Aeronautics case 66 and the Radio case 67), then it will fall within the competence of the Dominion Parliament as a matter affecting the peace, order and good government of Canada, though it may in another aspect touch on matters specially reserved to the provincial legislatures.\nThis statement is a recognition of the situation which is well known and understood in this country. It was quite frankly and quite properly admitted by Mr. Fillmore for the respondent, whose argument was merely that the Dominion had not in fact legislated in the field of s. 921 of the provincial statute.\nIt is no doubt true that legislation of the character involved in the provincial legislation regarded from the standpoint of the use of property is normally legislation as to civil rights, but use of property for the purposes of an aerodrome, or the prohibition of such use cannot, in my opinion, be divorced from the subject matter of aeronautics or aerial navigation as a whole. If that be so, it can make no difference from the standpoint of a basis for legislative jurisdiction on the part of the province that Parliament may not have occupied the field.\nOnce the decision is made that a matter is of national interest and importance, so as to fall within the peace, order and good government clause, the provinces cease to have any legislative jurisdiction with regard thereto and the Dominion jurisdiction is exclusive. If jurisdiction can be said to exist in the Dominion with respect to any matter under such clause, that statement can only be made because of the fact that such matters no longer come within the classes of subject assigned to the provinces. I think, therefore, that as the matters attempted to be dealt with by the provincial legislation here in question are matters inseparable from the field of aerial navigation, the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament extends thereto. The non-severability of the subject matter of \"aerial navigation\" is well illustrated by the existing Dominion legislation referred to below, and this legislation equally demonstrates that there is no room for the operation of the particular provincial legislation in any local or provincial sense.\nThe Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 3, as amended by c. 28 of the statutes of 1944-45, c. 9 of the statutes of 1945, and c. 23 of the statutes of 1950, provides in part as follows:\n3. It shall be the duty of the Minister\n(a) to supervise all matters connected with aeronautics.\n* * *\n(f) to prescribe aerial routes.\n* * *\n(1) to consider, draft and prepare for approval by the Governor in Council such regulations as may be considered necessary for the control or operation of aeronautics in Canada or within the limits of the territorial waters of Canada and for the control or operation of aircraft registered in Canada wherever such aircraft may be.\n* * *\n4. (1) Subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, the Minister may make regulations to control and regulate air navigation over Canada and the territorial waters of Canada and the conditions under which aircraft registered in Canada may be operated over the high seas or any territory not within Canada, and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, may make regulations with respect to\n* * *\n(c) licensing, inspection and regulation of all aerodromes and air-stations.\n(d) the conditions under which aircraft may be used or operated.\n(e) the conditions under which goods, mails and passengers may be transported in aircraft and under which any act may be performed in or from aircraft or under which aircraft may be employed.\n(f) the prohibition of navigation of aircraft over such areas as may be prescribed, either at all times or at such times or on such occasions only as may be specified in the regulation, and either absolutely or subject to such exceptions or conditions as may be so specified. (g) the areas within which aircraft coming from any places outside of Canada are to land, and the conditions to be complied with by any such aircraft.\n(h) aerial routes, their use and control.\n(i) the institution and enforcement of such laws, rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary for the safe and proper navigation of aircraft in Canada or within the limits of the territorial waters of Canada and of aircraft registered in Canada wherever such aircraft may be.\n* * *\n(3) Every person who violates the provisions of a regulation is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both fine and imprisonment.\n(4) Every person who violates an order or direction of the Minister made under a regulation is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both fine and imprisonment.\n12. (1) Subject to the approval of the Minister, the Board may issue to any person applying therefor a license to operate a commercial air service.\n* * *\n(5) In issuing any license the Board may prescribe the routes which may be followed or the areas to be served and may attach to the license such conditions as the Board may consider necessary or desirable in the public interest, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Board may impose conditions respecting schedules, places of call, carriage of passengers and freight, insurance, and subject to the Post Office Act, the carriage of mail.\n* * *\n15. (1) No person shall operate a commercial air service unless he holds a valid and subsisting license issued under section twelve.\nRegulations were passed under the authority of the above statute by P.C. 2129 of May 11, 1948. Part III deals with the subject matter of \"airports.\" The following paragraphs are pertinent:\n1. No area of land or water shall be used as an airport unless it has been licensed as herein, provided.\n2. Licenses to airports may be issued by the Minister and may be made subject to such conditions respecting the aircraft which may make use of the airport, the maintenance thereof, the marking of obstacles in the vicinity which may be dangerous to flying and otherwise, as the Minister may direct.\n4. The license of an airport may be suspended or cancelled by the Minister at any time for cause and shall cease to be valid two weeks after any change in the ownership of the airport, unless sooner renewed to the new owner.\n5. Every licensed airport shall be marked by day and by night as may be from time to time directed by the Minister. 7. (1) No person shall without authority of the Minister\u2014\n(a) mark any unlicensed surface or place with any mark or display any signal calculated or likely to induce any person to believe that such surface or place is a licensed airport;\n(b) knowingly use or permit the use of an airport for any purpose other than those for which it has been licensed.\n(2) The onus of proving the existence of any authority or license shall be upon the person charged.\n8. No water-craft shall cross or go upon that part of the water area forming part of any airport which it is necessary to keep clear of obstruction in order that aircraft may take off and alight in safety, having regard to the wind and weather conditions at the time, and every person in charge of a water-craft is guilty of a breach of these regulations if such craft crosses or goes upon such area after reasonable warning by signal or otherwise.\n9. There shall be kept at every licensed airport a register in which there shall be entered immediately after the alighting or taking off of an aircraft a record showing the nationality and registration marks of such aircraft, the name of the pilot, the hour of such alighting or taking off, the last point of call before such alighting and the intended destination of the aircraft.\n10. (1) Every licensed airport, and all aircraft and goods therein shall be open to the inspection of any customs officer, immigration officer, officer or person holding or named in any Writ of Assistance or any officer of or other person authorized by the Minister, but no building used exclusively for purposes relating to the construction of aircraft or aircraft equipment shall be subject to inspection except upon the written order of the Minister.\n(2) All state aircraft shall have at all reasonable times, the right of access to any licensed airport, subject to the conditions of the license.\nIn my opinion, just as it is impossible to separate intra-provincial flying from inter-provincial flying, the location and regulation of airports cannot be identified with either or separated from aerial navigation as a whole. The provincial legislation here in question must be held, therefore, to be ultra vires, and the by-law falls with it.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed. By agreement, no costs were asked or awarded in the courts below. I think, however, that the appellant should have his costs in this court as against the respondent, but that there should be no other costs. The judgment of Taschereau and Estey, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nEstey J.:\u2014The appellants submit that s. 921 of the Municipal Act (R.S.M. 1940, c. 141) is legislation in relation to aeronautics and, therefore, beyond the competency of the Legislature of Manitoba to enact.\n921. Any municipal corporation may pass by-laws for licensing, regulating, and, within certain defined areas, preventing the erection, maintenance and continuance of aerodromes or places where aeroplanes are kept for hire or gain.\nThe facts out of which this issue arises are as follows:\nThe appellant, Konrad Johannesson, has been engaged in commercial aviation in northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan since 1928. He desired an airport at Winnipeg and on September 27, 1947, obtained an option upon, and on April 20, 1948, purchased a portion of River Lot 33 Pl. 3992 in the respondent municipality for the purpose of equipping and maintaining it as an aerodrome.\nThe respondent municipality, under date of May 27, 1948, passed By-law No. 292, by virtue of the foregoing s. 921. The effect of this by-law may be briefly expressed: (a) As to lots 1 to 33, Pl. 3992, in the respondent municipality, the erection or maintenance of any aerodrome or machine shop for testing or repairing aircraft is entirely prohibited; (b) in the remaining portion neither of the foregoing may be erected or maintained without a licence from the respondent municipality.\nThe appellants, on October 22, 1948, asked the Court to declare s. 921 ultra vires of the Legislature of Manitoba and the enactment of By-law 292 by the respondent municipality a nullity.\nMr. Justice Campbell held that the Provincial Legislature had jurisdiction to enact s. 921 and that the by-law was valid. His judgment was affirmed by a majority of the Court of Appeal in Manitoba, Mr. Justice Coyne dissenting.\nThe Attorneys-General for Manitoba and the Dominion (the latter for the first time in this Court) have intervened and contended respectively that the Province has and has not competent authority to enact s. 921.\nThe judgments in the Court below proceed upon the basis that the Aeronautics Convention in Paris, ratified on behalf of the British Empire on June 1, 1922, was still in effect. Mr. Varcoe, on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada, however, informed the Court that this convention had been abrogated by the Civil Aviation Convention in Chicago in 1944, and became binding on Canada on April 4, 1947. This is important as the Chicago Convention, unlike the Paris Convention, is signed by Canada in her own right and, therefore, s. 132 of the British North America Act has no application in determining the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada and the Provincial Legislatures in relation thereto. Radio case 68; Labour Convention case 69. This does not, however, mean that the Aeronautics case 70, is of no importance in a consideration of the present issue. In that case the Judicial Committee considered three questions:\n(1) Have the Parliament and Government of Canada exclusive legislative and executive authority for performing the obligations of Canada, or of any province thereof, under the convention entitled \"Convention relating to the Regulation of Aerial Navigation?\"\n(3) Has the Parliament of Canada legislative authority to enact, in whole or in part, the provisions of s. 4 of the Aeronautics Act, c. 3, R.S.C. 1927?\n(4) Has the Parliament of Canada legislative authority to sanction the making and enforcement, in whole or in part, of the regulations contained in the Air Regulations, 1920, respecting: * * * (c) the licensing, inspection and regulation of all aerodromes and air stations?\nThe Paris Convention, drawn up at the Peace Conference in Paris and dated October, 1919, was ratified by His Majesty on behalf of the British Empire June 1, 1922. Canada already had enacted in 1919 the Air Board Act (S. of C. 1919, c. 11, 1st Session), amended it in 1922 (S. of C. 1922, c. 34) and styled it the \"Aeronautics Act\" (R.S.C. 1927, c. 3). It will be observed that the Air Board Act was enacted in the same year that the Paris Convention was drawn up, no doubt with the convention in mind, but the latter is not mentioned and the comprehensive language of the statute deals with aeronautics in all its phases. This is evident from the following provisions:\n3. It shall be the duty of the Air Board\u2014\n(a) to supervise all matters connected with aeronautics;\n* * *\n(f) to prescribe aerial routes;\n* * * (k) to investigate, examine and report on all proposals for the institution of commercial air services within or partly within Canada or the limits of the territorial waters of Canada;\n(l) to consider, draft, and prepare for approval by the Governor in Council such regulations as may be considered necessary for the control or operation of aeronautics in Canada or within the limits of the territorial waters of Canada; and,\n(m) to perform such other duties as the Governor in Council may from time to time impose.\nIt was this legislation that the Privy Council had before it in the Aeronautics case. Moreover, it should be noted that while question (1), as submitted by the Governor in Council, dealt with the legislative jurisdiction of Canada in relation to the Paris Convention, questions (3) and (4) concerned the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada to enact s. 4 of the Aeronautics Act and the regulations thereunder without regard to the Convention.\nIn the course of the judgment itself their Lordships sated at p. 64:\nThe determination of these questions depends upon the true construction of ss. 91, 92 and 132 of the British North America Act.\nTheir Lordships suggest that it may come under s. 91(2), (5) and (9), but expressly state that it does not come under (10) (Navigation and Shipping). They also point out that it does not come under Property and Civil Rights (92 (13)) and then state:\n* * * transport as a subject is dealt with in certain branches both of s. 91 and of s. 92, but neither of these sections deals specially with that branch of transport which is concerned with aeronautics.\nThen, after discussing s. 132, they conclude :\nTo sum up, having regard (a) to the terms of s. 132; (b) to the terms of the Convention which covers almost every conceivable matter relating to aerial navigation; and (c) to the fact that further legislative powers in relation to aerial navigation reside in the Parliament of Canada by virtue of s. 91, items 2, 5 and 7, it would appear that substantially the whole field of legislation in regard to aerial navigation belongs to the Dominion. There may be a small portion of the field which is not by virtue of specific words in the British North America Act vested in the Dominion; but neither is it vested by specific words in the provinces. As to that small portion it appears to the Board that it must necessarily belong to the Dominion under its power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of Canada. Further, their Lordships are influenced by the facts that the subject of aerial navigation and the fulfilment of Canadian obligations under s. 132 are matters of national interest and importance; and that aerial navigation is a class of subject which has attained such dimensions as to affect the body politic of the Dominion. Their Lordships, apart from s. 132, and in support of their answers to questions (3) and (4), were of the opinion that legislation in relation to aeronautics was within the competence of the Parliament of Canada. The remark of Viscount Dunedin, in the Radio case supra, (at 311) that\nthe leading consideration in the judgment of the Board was that the subject fell within the provisions of s. 132 of the British North America Act, 1867,\nand that of Lord Atkin in the Labour Convention case supra (at 351) that\nThe Aeronautics case concerned legislation to perform obligations imposed by a treaty between the Empire and foreign countries,\nparticularly when read in relation to their context, do not detract from the foregoing, while the observations of Viscount Simon in the Canada Temperance Federation case 71, would appear to support the foregoing view when, at p. 205, he states :\nIn their Lordships' opinion, the true test must be found in the real subject matter of the legislation: if it is such that it goes beyond local or provincial concern or interests and must from its inherent nature be the concern of the Dominion as a whole (as, for example, in the Aeronautics case and the Radio case), then it will fall within the competence of the Dominion Parliament as a matter affecting the peace, order and good government of Canada, though it may in another aspect touch on matters specially reserved to the provincial legislatures.\nThe Judicial Committee having decided that legislation in relation to aeronautics is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion, it follows that the province cannot legislate in relation thereto, whether the precise subject matter of the provincial legislation has, or has not already been covered by the Dominion legislation.\nIt is then submitted that if aeronautics is within the legislative competence of the Parliament of Canada, including the power to license and regulate aerodromes, it would not include the location and continuation of aerodromes, which would be a provincial matter under Property and Civil Rights. With great respect, it would appear that such a view attributes a narrower and more technical meaning to the word \"aeronautics\" than that which has been attributed to it generally in law and by those interested in the subject. Indeed, the definition adopted by Mr. Justice Dysart, as he found it in Corpus Juris, 2 C.J.S. 900,\nThe flight and period of flight from the time the machine clears the earth to the time it returns successfully to the earth and is resting securely on the ground,\ncontemplates the operation of the aeroplane from the moment it leaves the earth until it again returns thereto. This, it seems, in itself makes the aerodrome, as the place of taking off and landing, an essential part of aeronautics and aerial navigation. This view finds support in the fact that legislation in relation to aeronautics and aerial navigation, not only in Canada, but also in Great Britain and the United States, deals with aerodromes, as well as the conventions above mentioned. Indeed, in any practical consideration it is impossible to separate the flying in the air from the taking off and landing on the ground and it is, therefore, wholly impractical, particularly when considering the matter of jurisdiction, to treat them as independent one from the other.\nThe submission that in the granting of the licence the sufficiency of the location will always be considered and might even be the controlling factor in the granting or refusing of a licence, in so far as it may be of assistance, emphasizes the importance of the location of the aerodrome and of the essential part the aerodrome plays in any scheme of aeronautics. Legislation which in pith and substance is in relation to the aerodrome is legislation in relation to the larger subject of aeronautics and is, therefore, beyond the competence of the Provincial Legislatures.\nIt is submitted that s. 921 is zoning legislation, as that term is now understood in municipal legislation. The general provisions for the enactment of zoning by-laws are contained in ss. 904, 905 and 906 of this statute. As notwithstanding this general provision such legislation may be enacted under other sections, it is necessary to determine the nature and character of the provisions of s. 921. The foregoing ss. 904, 905 and 906 are typical of legislation authorizing zoning by-laws. The end and purpose of zoning legislation, as the name indicates, is to authorize the municipality to pass by-laws in respect of certain areas and make those areas subject to prohibitions and restrictions designed to provide uniformity within those particular areas. The Legislature, in enacting s. 921, provided that, without regard to the nature and character or the use and purpose made of the area, the municipality may prohibit entirely, or permit only under a licence issued by it, an aerodrome within certain areas. Such legislation is in pith and substance in relation to aerodromes and, therefore, in relation to aeronautics rather than to zoning.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs to the appellants, Konrad Johannesson and Holmfridur M. E. Johannesson, against the respondent municipality.\nLocke J.:\u2014The proceedings in this matter were initiated by notice of a motion to be made in the Court of King's Bench for an order declaring s. 921 of The Municipal Act (R.S.M., 1940, c. 141) to be ultra vires and the respondent municipality's by-law No. 292, enacted in part under the authority of that section, to be of no effect. On the hearing before Campbell J., the Attorney-General for Manitoba appeared and supported the position for the municipality and the application was dismissed.\nSection 921 provides that any municipal corporation may pass by-laws for licensing, regulating, and, within certain defined areas, preventing the erection, maintenance and continuation of aerodromes or places where airplanes are kept for hire or gain. The terms of the by-law are quoted verbatim in other judgments delivered in this matter and need not be repeated.\nOn the appeal, Dysart, J.A. considered that s. 921 in so far as it authorizes a municipal corporation to prohibit the erection, within a described area, of an aerodrome intended for other than Dominion Government use, was intra vires and that the by-law was valid to that extent. He decided also that the requirement that a licence (in the sense of a building permit) should be obtained was within provincial powers and the by-law, accordingly, effective to this further extent. As to the remainder of the by-law, he considered it to be ultra vires.\nAdamson J.A. was of the opinion that s. 921 of the Municipal Act would be within provincial powers if the words \"licensing and regulating\" and the words \"continu- ance and maintenance\" were deleted. With these amendments, the section would read :\nAny municipal corporation may pass by-laws within certain defined areas preventing the erection of aerodromes or places where airplanes are kept for hire or gain.\nAs to the by-law, he considered paragraphs 1 and 3 to be intra vires if the words \"and continued\" were eliminated but that paragraphs 2 and 4 in their present form, were ultra vires as requiring a licence from the municipality to operate an aerodrome after location. He expressed the further view that if these paragraphs were amended to require merely a building permit prior to licensing by the Minister under the Aeronautics Act, they would be valid. Coyne J.A. dissented, considering s. 921 to be ultra vires the province. The formal certificate of the Registrar of the Court of Appeal says that the Chief Justice of Manitoba and the late Mr. Justice Richards concurred in the result. While two members of the Court thus considered both the section and the by-law to be in part ultra vires, since neither the learned Chief Justice nor the late Richards J.A. expressed their views on these matters, the appeal was dismissed in toto. In the result, both the section and the by-law have been found intra vires the province and the municipality respectively.\nThe material filed by the appellants on the motion shows that Konrad Johannesson, described as a flying service operator, has been engaged in commercial aviation since 1928 and holds a licence issued by the Air Transport Board of Canada to operate an air service at Winnipeg and Flin Flon: that the service which he operates under this licence covers territory in central and northern Manitoba and northern Saskatchewan, and is conducted with light and medium planes mainly equipped in summer with floats and, in the winter, with skis in order to permit landing on the numerous lakes and rivers in this territory and that these planes have to be repaired and serviced at Winnipeg, the only place within the territory where the necessary supplies and facilities are available for that purpose. It is said that there are no existing facilities on the Red River in Winnipeg for the repairing and servicing of planes equipped with floats and that repairs can only be made for such planes by dismantling them at some private dock and transporting them by trucks to the Stephenson Airport. According to Johannesson's affidavit, he searched the areas surrounding Winnipeg for an area of level land having access to a straight stretch of the Red River of a sufficient length for the landing of airplanes equipped with floats, which would comply with the regulations of the Civil Aviation Branch of the Department of Transport relating to a licensed air strip, and the only portion of land which he had found was that purchased by him and his wife in the rural municipality of West St. Paul. The material does not state, and it was apparently assumed, that the Court would take judicial notice of the fact that there is no body of water in the area between Emerson on the south and Selkirk on the north, other than the Red River, on which planes equipped for alighting on water could land or take off. The material further discloses that, due to the lack of suitable facilities for their servicing and repair, float-equipped planes from the United States and other provinces of Canada are by-passing Winnipeg.\nThe question to be determined is one of far-reaching importance. Johannesson apparently contemplated the establishment of an aerodrome, within the meaning of that term as defined by the Air Regulations hereinafter referred to, where light and medium weight planes not equipped with radio but with suitable equipment for alighting either upon land or water, could land and take off and where they could be repaired and otherwise furnished with service.\nThe control of aeronautics in Canada was first dealt with by statute by Parliament, by c. 11 of the Statutes of 1919. During the sittings of the Peace Conference in Paris at the close of the Great War, a convention relating to the regulation of aerial navigation was drawn up which was subsequently ratified by His Majesty on behalf of the British Empire and it was with a view to performing the obligations of Canada as part of the Empire under this convention, then in course of preparation, that the Air Board Act of 1919 was passed. That statute set up a board whose duties included that of supervising all matters connected with aeronautics, constructing and maintaining all government aerodromes and air stations, prescribing aerial routes, licensing and regulating all aerodromes and air stations and prescribing the areas within which aircraft coming from any places outside of Canada were to land. By c. 34 of the Statutes of Canada 1922 the Act of 1919 was repealed and all the powers and functions vested by it in the Board were directed to be exercised by or under the direction of the Minister of National Defence. The duties and powers of the Minister were further defined by c. 3, R.S.C. 1927, and include duties similar to those of the Air Board under the Act of 1919. Under powers contained in the statute as originally enacted, Air Regulations dealing in detail with the control of aerial navigation were enacted, and the right of Parliament to sanction the making of certain of these regulations and the matter of the exclusive legislative and executive authority of Parliament to perform the obligations of Canada or of any province thereof under the convention and the matter of its legislative authority to enact, in whole or in part, the provisions of s. 4 of the Aeronautics Act, c. 3, R.S.C. 1927, were referred to this Court by the Governor-General in Council under s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act. An appeal was taken to the Judicial Committee from the answers made in this Court to the questions submitted. The judgment of the Board allowing the appeal found that exclusive legislative and executive authority for performing the obligations of Canada or of any province under the convention was in the Parliament of Canada, that s. 4 of the Act was intra vires and that it was within the power of Parliament to sanction the making and enforcement of the said Air Regulations (1932 A.C. 54).\nWe were informed upon the argument of this matter that the Convention, the terms of which were considered on the appeal to the Privy Council, had been denounced by Canada and a new International Convention entered into by this country with other States in the year 1944, by which substantially similar international obligations were assumed. This fact was not drawn to the attention of the Court of Appeal but, in my opinion, it does not affect the questions to be determined here. Apart from the fact that, as I understand the arguments addressed to us, it is not contended on behalf of any of the respondents that the Aeronautics Act is ultra vires the Parliament of Canada or that it was without authority to sanction the Air Regulations in force at the time of the commencement of this litigation, if, as was found by the Judicial Committee, it was within the legislative competence of Parliament to enact c. 3, R.S.C. 1927, it would not become invalid by this circumstance (A.G. Ontario v. Canada Temperance Federation 72.\nParliament had thus dealt generally with the matter of aeronautics when in the years following the Great War the Manitoba Legislature, by s. 18 of c. 82 of the Statutes of 1920 of Manitoba, passed an amendment to s. 612 of The Municipal Act, R.S.M. 1913, c. 133, assuming to empower municipal councils to make by-laws:\nfor licensing, regulating and within certain defined areas, preventing the erection, maintenance and continuance of aerodromes and places where airplanes are kept for hire or gain.\nWith a slight change in the phraseology which does not affect the present matter, the present s. 921 of c. 141, R.S.M. 1940, is to this effect. Neither the word \"aerdromes\", as it was spelled in the statute of 1920, or the word \"aerodromes\" as it appears in the present statute, were defined. Neither word appears in the Oxford English Dictionary, but in the shorter Oxford Dictionary the word \"aerodrome\" is defined as:\nA course for the use of flying machines: a tract of level ground from which airplanes or airships can start.\nIn the Supplement to Murray's New English Dictionary issued in 1933 the word is defined as:\nA course for practice or contest with flying machines: a tract of level ground from which flying machines (airplanes or airships) can start.\nThe area within which the prohibition of the erection, or maintenance, or continuation of an aerodrome is contained in the by-law is the portions of river lots 1 to 33 lying to the east of the main highway running to the west of the Red River and includes property such as Johannesson's fronting upon the river. Whether in view of the decision in Patton v. Pioneer Navigation & Sand Co. 73, dealing with the rights of the owners of lands fronting upon the Assiniboia River, also a navigable non-tidal stream, it was intended by the by-law to prevent planes equipped with floats from alighting upon and taking off from the waters of the Red River adjoining Johannesson's property, does not appear. Since, however, the right to alight and take off without the right to maintain facilities upon the shore where the planes might be serviced and repaired would be presumably valueless, the prohibition in the by-law against the building or installation of any machine-shop for the testing or repairing of aircraft in the defined area is effective in preventing the operation by Johannesson of a commercial airport or aerodrome for planes designed to alight upon the water.\nIn my opinion, the position taken by the province and by the municipality in this matter cannot be maintained: Whether the control and direction of aeronautics in all its branches be one which lies within the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament, and this I think to be the correct view, or whether it be a domain in which Provincial and Dominion legislation may overlap, I think the result must be the same. It has been said on behalf of the respondents that the by-law is merely a zoning regulation passed in exercise of the powers vested in the municipality elsewhere in the Municipal Act and I understand the section referred to is that portion of section 896 which, under the heading \"Zoning trades\", empowers a municipal corporation to pass by-laws for preventing the erection of certain specified buildings and the carrying on of certain occupations within defined areas, these including the erection, establishment or maintenance of machine shops which would presumably cover those designed for the repair of aircraft. The by-law, in so far as it prohibits the erection, maintenance or continuation of aerodromes, must depend for its validity upon s. 921: subsec. 3 is apparently based upon subsec. (h) of s. 896. The inclusion of the prohibition of the erection or maintenance of a machine-shop, however, is obviously for the purpose of preventing the use either of the strip of land fronting upon the river or the surface of the river adjoining to the east as an effective aerodrome. Section 921 was undoubtedly passed for the purpose of enabling municipal corporations to prohibit or to license or regulate the activity of aeronautics in and upon the lands and the waters within their boundaries, and not merely as an addition to the powers of zoning trades assumed to be given by s. 896. Had this been intended and irrespective of any question as to its validity, no doubt it would have been done by amendment to subsec. (f) or (h) of s. 896. The powers sought to be conferred upon the Municipal Council appear to me to be in direct conflict with those vested in the Minister of National Defence by the Aeronautics Act. Section 3(a) of that statute imposes upon the Minister the duty of supervising all matters connected with aeronautics and prescribing aerial routes and by s. 4 he is authorized, with the approval of the Governor in Council, to make regulations with respect to, inter alia, the areas within which aircraft coming from any place outside of Canada are to land and as to aerial routes, their use and control. The power to prescribe the aerial routes must include the right to designate where the terminus of any such route is to be maintained, and the power to designate the area within which foreign aircraft may land, of necessity includes the power to designate such area, whether of land or water, within any municipality in any province of Canada deemed suitable for such purpose.\nIf the validity of the Aeronautics Act and the Air Regulations be conceded, it appears to me that this matter must be determined contrary to the contentions of the respondent. It is, however, desirable, in my opinion, that some of the reasons for the conclusion that the field of aeronautics is one exclusively within Federal jurisdiction should be stated. There has been since the First World War an immense development in the use of aircraft flying between the various provinces of Canada and between Canada and other countries. There is a very large passenger traffic between the provinces and to and from foreign countries, and a very considerable volume of freight traffic not only between the settled portions of the country but between those areas and the northern part of Canada, and planes are extensively used in the carriage of mails. That this traffic will increase greatly in volume and extent is undoubted. While the largest activity in the carrying of passengers and mails east and west is in the hands of a government controlled company, private companies carry on large operations, particularly between the settled parts of the country and the North and mails are carried by some of these lines. The maintenance and extension of this traffic, particularly to the North, is essential to the opening up of the country and the development of the resources of the nation. It requires merely a statement of these well recognized facts to demonstrate that the field of aeronautics is one which concerns the country as a whole. It is an activity, which to adopt the language of Lord Simon in the Attorney General for Ontario v. Canada Temperance Federation 74, must from its inherent nature be a concern of the Dominion as a whole. The field of legislation is not, in my opinion, capable of division in any practical way. If, by way of illustration, it should be decided that it was in the interests of the inhabitants of some northerly part of the country to have airmail service with centres of population to the south and that for that purpose some private line, prepared to undertake such carriage, should be licensed to do so and to establish the southern terminus for their route at some suitable place in the Municipality of West St. Paul where, apparently, there is an available and suitable field and area of water where planes equipped in a manner enabling them to use the facilities of such an airport might land, it would be intolerable that such a national purpose might be defeated by a rural municipality, the Council of which decided that the noise attendant on the operation of airplanes was objectionable. Indeed, if the argument of the respondents be carried to its logical conclusion the rural municipalities of Manitoba through which the Red River passes between Emerson and Selkirk, and the City of Winnipeg and the Town of Selkirk might prevent the operation of any planes equipped for landing upon water by denying them the right to use the river for that purpose.\nIt is true that the decision in the Aeronautics Reference 75, really turned upon the point that by virtue of s. 132 of the British North America Act it was within the power of Parliament to enact s. 4 of the Aeronautics Act, c. 3, R.S.C. 1927, and to authorize the adoption of the Air Regulations referred to in the questions submitted to the Court. There were, however, expressions of opinion on other aspects of the matter in the judgment delivered by Lord Sankey L.C. which are of assistance. At page 70 of the report His Lordship, in referring to the respective field assigned to Parliament and the Legislatures, said in part:\nWhile the Courts should be jealous in upholding the charter of the Provinces as enacted in s. 92 it must no less be borne in mind that the real object of the Act was to give the central government those high functions and almost sovereign powers by which uniformity of legislation might be secured on all questions which were of common concern to all the provinces as members of a constituent whole.\nAgain, in the conclusions of the judgment, it is stated that their Lordships were influenced by the facts that the subject of aerial navigation and the fulfilment of Canadian obligations under s. 132 are matters of national interest and importance and that aerial navigation is a class of subjects which has attained such dimensions as to affect the body politic of the Dominion. In A.G. for Ontario v. A.G. for Canada 76, Lord Watson, referring to the authority given to Parliament by the introductory enactment of s. 91 to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the class of subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces, said that the exercise of these powers ought to be strictly confined to such matters as are unquestionably of Canadian interest and importance. This passage from Lord Watson's judgment is incorporated in the second of the four propositions stated by Lord Tomlin in A.G. for Canada v. A.G. for British Columbia 77. The passage from the judgment of Lord Simon in A.G. for Ontario v. Canada Temperance Federation 78, reads:\u2014\nIn their Lordships' opinion the true test must be found in the real subject matter of the legislation: if it is such that it goes beyond local or provincial concern or interests and must from its inherent nature be the concern of the Dominion as a whole (as, for example, in the Aeronautics case 79, and the Radio case 80, then it will fall within the competence of the Dominion Parliament as a matter affecting the peace, order and good government of Canada, though it may in another aspect touch on matters specially reserved to the provincial legislatures.\nWhile the statement of Lord Sankey in the Aeronautics Reference that aerial navigation is a class of subjects which has attained such dimensions as to affect the body politic of the Dominion as a whole, and that of Lord Simon in the Canada Temperance matter in referring to that case and the Radio case, were perhaps unnecessary to the decision of those matters, they support what I consider to be the true view of this matter that the whole subject of aeronautics lies within the field assigned to Parliament as a matter affecting the peace, order and good government of Canada; S. 921 of The Municipal Act (R.S.M. 1940 c. 141) clearly trespasses upon that field and must be declared ultra vires the province. As to the by-law I am unable, with respect, to agree with the contention that it is a mere zoning regulation or that, even if it were, it could be sustained. On the contrary, I consider it to be a clear attempt to prevent the carrying on of the operation of commercial aerodromes within the municipality. As the right to do this must depend upon s. 921, the by-law must also be declared ultra vires.\nIf this matter were to be considered as dealing with a legislative field where the powers of Parliament and of the Provincial Legislature overlap, I think the result would necessarily be the same since for the reasons above stated it appears to me that the Aeronautics Act, and in particular s. 4, is legislation in this field with which s. 921 of The Municipal Act clearly conflicts.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and a declaration made that s. 921 of The Municipal Act and the municipal by-law are each ultra vires.

It was also established that during the time in which the child must have been conceived, the appellant and his wife had had sexual intercourse but that contraceptives were used, and further that the child\u2019s birth was registered pursuant to The Vital Statistics Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 88. Two qualified medical practitioners, whose evidence was uncontradicted, testified to having had tests made of the blood of the appellant, of his wife and of the child, and that the tests indicated that if the child was born of the wife, which was admitted, it was not merely improbable but impossible that the appellant was its father.\nHeld: (1) that there was ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of adultery.\n(2) that on the evidence the case should be treated as one in which it was established that the appellant had had sexual intercourse with his wife during the period within which the child must in the course of nature have been conceived, and if the matter ended there it would have followed that the child must be held to be legitimate, but that the uncontradicted evidence of two qualified medical practitioners to the effect that tests carried out with samples of blood of the appellant, of his wife and of the child, indicated that if the child was born of the wife, as was admitted, then it was not merely improbable but impossible that the appellant was the father: rebuts the presumption of legitimacy. R. v. Luffe 8 East 193; Preston-Jones v. Preston-Jones [1951] 1 All. E.R. 124.\n(3) that under the circumstances of the case the failure of the trial judge to deal with the presumption of legitimacy could not have occasioned any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. (4) that the presumption of legitimacy referred to in The Vital Statistics Act, 1948 (Ont.) c. 97, is a rebuttable presumption of law in Ontario since the enactment of s. 5a of The Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 119 (now s. 6 of R.S.O. 1950, c. 119).\n(5) that since the sufficiency of proof that the samples of blood tested came respectively from the appellant, his wife, and the child, was not called in question at the trial, it must be taken as being established. Earnshaw v. Dominion of Canada Insurance Co. [1943] O.R. 385 at 395-96.\n(6) that evidence of certain conversations between the appellant and his wife in the absence of the respondent (in which the wife confessed to adultery with the respondent and declared him father of the child) was properly admitted: (i) on the principle the letters of the Countess of Aylesford were admitted in the Aylesford Peerage Case 11 App. Cas. 1; (ii) to show consistency. Phipson on Evidence 8 Ed. 480; R. v. Coyle 7 Cox 74 at 75; Flanagan v. Fahy [1918] 2 Ir. R. 361 at 381.\nPer: Kerwin J.: A charge of conspiracy having been made by the respondent in his pleadings, evidence was admissible upon this branch of the case, if for no other reason.\n(7) that evidence that the child resembled the defendant (respondent) was admissible. Doe Marr v. Marr 3 U.C.C.P. 36.\n(8) that the failure of the trial judge to advise the wife of the appellant of the protection afforded her by the proviso in s. 7 of The Evidence Act was, since it was obvious that the wife had decided to give evidence as to her adultery, unimportant. Elliot v. Elliot [1933] O.R. 206 at 212 approved. Allen v. Allen and Bell [1894] p. 248 at 255, Laffin v. Laffin [1945] 3 D.L.R. 595 and Waugh v. Waugh [1946] 2 D.L.R. 133, distinguished.\nAppeal allowed and judgment at trial restored.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] allowing an appeal by the defendant from the judgment of Gale J. after a trial with a jury.\nJ.J. Robinette K.C. and Benjamin Laker for the appellant. Evidence of conversations between the plaintiff and his wife in which she is said to have admitted her misconduct with the defendant and declared him the father of the child, was admissible evidence: (i) on the ground that it was res gestae. (ii) If the evidence was inadmissible, there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice by reason of the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s wife was called and gave evidence of the same matter which the plaintiff gave in his evidence, (iii) Counsel for the defendant did not object to such evidence, but cross-examined both the appellant and his wife thereon, and thereby waived the rule excluding the said evidence.\nThe Court of Appeal erred in penalizing the plaintiff in costs of the trial and of the Appeal, for a reason which had no foundation in fact, i.e. that the trial was abortive due to the persistence of counsel for plaintiff in offering testimony which was inadmissible as evidence; no objection thereto was offered by counsel for the defence, nor by the trial judge, nor was there persistence by the plaintiff thereon.\nThe Court of Appeal erred in holding that no evidence was produced to prove the identity of the plaintiff, his wife or the child as being the persons whose blood was tested, and that they were in fact the plaintiff, his wife and the child. (a) There was sufficient identification by the evidence of Dr. Fremes. (b) Exhibit 8 sufficiently identified the plaintiff, his wife, and the infant Susan Welstead, as the persons whose blood was tested. (c) In the absence of any evidence to the contrary or any suggestion that the said persons were not the plaintiff, his wife and the infant Susan Welstead, the plaintiff made a prima facie case of identity. (d) There was sufficient identification of the persons having in mind that the action is a civil one and not a criminal case.\nThe Court of Appeal erred in setting aside the trial judgment on the basis that the trial judge failed to tell the jury that the fact that the birth of the child was registered raised a presumpion of legitimacy under s. 6(3) of The Vital Statistics Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 88.\n(a) That Act was repealed by The Vital Statistics Act, 1948, c. 97. The latter Act was in force at the date of the issue of the writ and at the date of trial. The learned justice in Appeal proceeded on the basis the 1937 Act was still in force. The birth certificate was put as corroborative evidence of the place and date of birth only.\n(b) The gist of the action of criminal conversation being damages for adultery, the jury was entitled to find that adultery had taken place irrespective of the question as to illegitimacy. (c) There was direct evidence of adultery, and further evidence of opportunity and of familiarity sufficient to conclude that the appellant\u2019s wife and the defendant had engaged in sexual intercourse. The jury so found, as they were entitled to, irrespective as to whether a child was or was not born as a result thereof.\nThe Court of Appeal erred in setting aside the trial judgment on the ground that the trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that in considering the legitimacy or illegitimacy of the child as evidence of adultery there is a strong presumption of law in favour of legitimacy.\n(a) The presumption as to illegitimacy is a rebuttable one, and there was medical evidence, re the blood tests, which a jury acting reasonably, could have found rebutted the presumption.\n(b) Apart from the presumption of legitimacy there was a finding by the jury of adultery based upon a preponderance of credible evidence.\n(c) The jury was entitled to find that adultery had been committed whether the child in question was legitimate or not and counsel for the defendant did not ask that a question as to legitimacy be put to the jury.\n(d) There was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice by reason of the fact that the trial judge did not tell the jury of the presumption as to legitimacy and counsel for the defendant did not ask the trial judge to tell the jury of the common law presumption of legitimacy.\nC.L. Dubbin K.C. for the respondent. The Court of Appeal for Ontario were right in holding that the trial was unsatisfactory and that the verdict could not stand and must be set aside. The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that in considering the legitimacy of the child, Susan, on the issue of adultery, that there was a presumption in favour of legitimacy. He left the question of legitimacy or illegitimacy as if no presumption existed and erred in failing to direct the jury that the child is conclusively proven legitimate where the evidence disclosed that the husband and wife co-habited together, and where no impotency is proved. Russell v. Russell[2]; Gordon v. Gordon[3]; Brown v. Argue[4].\nThe trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that the fact that the child born to Mrs. Welstead, was registered in the name of the plaintiff, was prima facie evidence of legitimacy, and misdirected the jury on that issue when that very question was asked of him by a juror. Smith v. Smith[5]; Crone v. Crone[6]; R.S.O. 1950, c. 412, s. 41.\nThe learned trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury on the issue of legitimacy or illegitimacy that the presumption of legitimacy could only be overcome by producing in the minds of the tribunal of fact a moral certainty. Clark v. The King[7]; Morris v. Davies[8]. Non\u2011access not having been shown, but in fact the contrary having been proved, the other evidence which was submitted which tended to bastardize the child was inadmissible. It is contrary to public policy to admit such evidence save and except where non-access is first established. Wigmore on Evidence 3rd Ed. Vol. 1 s. 134.\nParents are not permitted in order to bastardize a child, from which adultery can be inferred, to give evidence that although they carried on normal marital relations they practiced birth control devices. Here both so testified. They cannot give evidence tending to bastardize a child born in lawful wedlock from which adultery could be inferred, even though the judgment sought for did not result in a declaration of illegitimacy. It may be that a wife\u2019s admission as to adultery is admissible and even perhaps she may be permitted to say that she is pregnant by a man other than her husband, so long as her evidence stops there, since that is merely evidence of misconduct, but does not tend to bastardize the child. Warren v. Warren[9]. The spouses cannot go further and try to prove the child illegitimate by suggesting that birth control methods used by them made conception impossible. It is contrary to public policy to permit a jury to be the forum to determine the effectiveness of birth control devices. Russell v. Russell, supra at 700,726; Goodright v. Moss[10]. Since the amendment to the Evidence Act (1946 Ont. c. 25, s. 1) certain hardships that the rule in Russell v. Russell imposed with respect to the evidence of non-access have been removed and spouses pursuant to the amendment can now give evidence of non-access but apart from that exception the common law provision against a married person giving evidence tending to bastardize a child remains unimpaired. Crone v. Crone supra at 574. The evidence of the plaintiff as to what his wife told him was inadmissible and could not under any circumstances be evidence against the defendant.\nNeither the plaintiff nor his wife gave any evidence as to a blood test or that they took the baby in question to Dr. Fremes. The doctor was called and told of examining a Mr. and Mrs. Welstead and a baby, Susan, but he did not identify either of them, who were in the court room at the time, as the persons who had been to see him and, even more significant, there was no evidence tendered that the baby he examined was the baby in question. There was no suggestion in the evidence that he knew the Welsteads prior to the time of the visit. His evidence was inadmissible; there being an essential gap in the required proof. The effect of his evidence was merely to give an opinion that the child in question was illegitimate and was inadmissible by reason of it being contrary to the policy of law to embark on such an investigation unless non-access is first proved; furthermore, the only effect of his evidence being to bastardize the child and not to advance the adultery, it was irrevelant and inadmissible.\nThe trial judge erred in permitting Mrs. Welstead to be examined by counsel for the plaintiff without first advising her of the protection afforded by the Evidence Act and it is not at all clear from the evidence that if she had been so advised, that she would have testified. The Evidence Act R.S.O. 1937, c. 119, s. 8: Laffin v. Laffin[11]; Waugh v. Waugh[12]; Elliot v. Elliot[13]. The trial judge erred in directing the jury as to the onus of proof to establish adultery. He ought to have directed the jury that before they could find adultery they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed adultery with the wife of the plaintiff. Ginesi v. Ginesi[14]; DeVoin v. DeVoin[15]; Campbell v. Campbell[16]; George v. George[17].\nThe Court of Appeal were right in setting aside the verdict on the ground that the trial was not satisfactory, and having rightfully come to that conclusion had a judicial discretion to direct a new trial on such terms as they saw fit and proper and no appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada from the exercise of such discretion. The Supreme Court Act 1927 R.S.C. c. 35, s. 44 as amended.\nThe plaintiff having resumed co-habitation with Mrs. Welstead at the time of the issue of the writ, did not suffer any damages and even if the Court of Appeal erred in setting aside the judgment herein, this appeal should be dismissed.\nKERWIN J.:\u2014This is an action for damages for criminal conversation tried before Gale J. and a jury. Three questions were submitted to the jury which, together with the answers, are as follows:\u2014\n1. Was adultery committed between the defendant Charles Brown and the plaintiff\u2019s wife, Lucy Irene Welstead?\nA. Yes.\n2. If your answer to question 1 is \u201cyes\u201d, where and when was such adultery committed?\nA. On the Base Line Road between Whitby and Pickering Beach on or about February 17th, 18th or 19th, 1948.\n3. If your answer to question 1 is \u201cyes\u201d, at what amount do you assess the damages of the plaintiff Fitzroy Ashley Welstead?\nA. $4,000.\nOn these answers judgment was entered for the plaintiff for $4,000 and costs. On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that judgment was set aside but a new trial was permitted the plaintiff on condition that within a fixed time he pay the costs of the abortive trial and of the appeal. As this was not done, the Court ordered that the appeal be allowed and the action dismissed, with costs. It is from that judgment that the present appeal is taken. The adultery testified to by the appellant\u2019s wife was denied by the defendant respondent. A child was born to the wife on November 28, 1948. This birth was registered on December 21, 1948, at which time the Vital Statistics Act of the Province of Ontario was R.S.O. 1937, c. 38, and by s. 24 thereof it was provided that no child born in wedlock should be registered as illegitimate. The action was commenced in 1949 and the trial commenced February 21, 1950, and in the meantime the 1948 Vital Statistics Act, c. 97, had been proclaimed to be in force as of January 1, 1949. By s. 38 thereof a birth certificate shall contain only the name of the child, date and place of birth, sex, date of registration, and registration number. The following certificate was issued pursuant to s. 39 and was filed as an exhibit at the trial:\u2014\nPROVINCE OF ONTARIO\nTHE VITAL STATISTICS ACT, 1948.\nName: Welstead, Susan Margaret.\nDate of Birth: Nov. 28, 1948. Sex F.\nPlace of Birth: Pickering Twp. Ontario.\nRegistration: Dec. 21, 1948. 48-05-098516\nIssued at Toronto, Ontario.\nThe 22 Day of Feb. 1950.\nG.W. DUNBAR\nRegistrar-General.\nSubsections 1 and 4 of s. 41 provide:\u2014\n41(1). A certificate purporting to be issued pursuant to section 39 and signed by the Registrar\u2011General shall be admissible in any court in Ontario as prima facie evidence of the facts certified to be recorded, and it shall not be necessary to prove the signature or official position of the person by whom the certificate purports to be signed.\n(4). Notwithstanding subsections 1 and 3, no birth certificate and no certified copy of a registration of birth or still-birth shall be admissible in evidence to affect a presumption of legitimacy.\nThe presumption of legitimacy referred to in subsection 4 of s. 41 is a rebuttable presumption of law that a child born during lawful wedlock is legitimate and that access occurred between the parents. Under the decision of the House of Lords in Russell v. Russell[18], the evidence of the parents would not have been admissible to prove their access or non-access during marriage with the object or possible result of bastardizing a child born during wedlock but in 1946 the Ontario legislature intervened to alter this rule by enacting s. 5a of The Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 119, in the following terms:\u2014\n5a. Without limiting the generality of section 5, a husband or a wife may in any action, give evidence that he or she did or did not have sexual intercourse with the other party to the marriage at any time or within any period of time before or during the marriage.\nBoth the appellant and his wife testified that at the time the child Susan could have been conceived they did not have sexual intercourse except with the use of contraceptives. Under s. 5a. of The Evidence Act (now s. 6 of R.S.O. 1950, c. 119) this evidence is admissible, its effect being, of course, an entirely different matter. However, it also appears in evidence that samples of the blood of the child and of the appellant were taken and that in the opinion of the medical men called on behalf of the appellant, and whose evidence was not contradicted, the appellant could not have been the father of the child. This evidence is also admissible: Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd edition, vol. 1, para. 165a.\nThis is not an action for divorce so that we are not faced with the problem whether the word \u201csatisfy\u201d in sections 29 and 30 of the British Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857, or in section 178 of the British Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925, as amended by section 4 of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1937, connotes something less than proof beyond reasonable doubt: George v. George[19]; Preston-Jones v. Preston-Jones[20]. The present is a civil action as is an action for dissolution of marriage: Mordaunt v. Moncrieffe[21]. However, in proceedings to establish legitimacy Lord Lyndhurst in Morris v. Davies[22] stated as follows:\u2014\nThe law was laid down by the learned Judges in the Banbury Peerage case in these terms: \u201cThat in every case where a child is born in lawful wedlock, the husband not being separated from his wife by sentence of divorce, sexual intercourse is presumed to have taken place between the husband and wife, Until that presumption is encountered by such evidence as proves, to the satisfaction of those who are to decide the question, that such sexual intercourse did not take place at any time, when, by such intercourse the husband could, according to the law of nature, be the father of such child.\u201d and, again, when sitting in the House of Lords, at page 265:\u2014\nIt (the presumption of legitimacy) is not to be broken in upon, or shaken, by a mere balance of probability; the evidence for the purpose of repelling it must be strong, distinct, satisfactory and conclusive.\nThe same rule applies where \u201cthe result of a finding of adultery in a case such as this is in effect to bastardize the child. That is a matter in which from time out of mind strict proof has been required\u201d per Lord Simonds in Preston-Jones v. Preston-Jones. In the same case Lord MacDermott states: \u201cThe evidence must no doubt be fair and satisfy beyond a mere balance of probabilities, and conclusive in the sense that it will satisfy what Lord Stowell, when Sir William Scott, described in Loveden v. Loveden[23], as \u201cthe guarded discretion of a reasonable and just man.\u201d\nIn Baxter v. Baxter[24], the House of Lords had to construe s. 7(1) (a) of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1937:\nIn addition to any other grounds on which a marriage is by law void or voidable, a marriage shall be voidable on the ground (a) that the marriage has not been consummated owing to the wilful refusal of the respondent to consummate the marriage; * * *\nIt was held that a marriage may be consummated within that section although artificial methods of contraception are used. To say, however, that the parties to a marriage could not testify that they did not have sexual intercourse except with the use of contraceptives is another matter. If neither the appellant nor his wife testified as they did, the evidence of the doctors would have been admissible; although the spouses did testify, the doctors\u2019 evidence is still evidence, and the effect of their evidence was for the jury to determine.\nThe trial judge said to the jury that the appellant must show by a preponderance of credible evidence the adultery charged, that it should be \u201cstrictly proved\u201d, that \u201cyou should exercise a cautious discretion\u201d, that \u201cyou should proceed with caution before you decide that adultery had been established. So that to that extent there is a rather heavy duty cast upon the plaintiff to establish his case.\u201d\nThe jury should have been charged in accordance with the authorities cited as to the presumption of legitimacy and as to the kind of evidence there must be in order to overcome that presumption. However, s. 28(1) of The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 190, provides:\u2014\nA new trial shall not be granted on the ground of misdirection * * * unless some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned.\nIn view of the uncontradicted evidence of the doctors, I am unable to say that any miscarriage of justice has occurred, and unless the respondent is able to justify the other reasons of the Court of Appeal for setting aside the verdict, the order complained of cannot stand.\nThat Court determined that there was no evidence to prove the identities of the appellant and the child as being the persons whose blood was tested. However, upon a reading of the record, I am satisfied that there was such evidence and that in fact the trial proceeded upon the basis that there was no question about such matters. The Court of Appeal also considered that the evidence of conversations between the appellant and his wife, in which she is said to have admitted her misconduct with the respondent was inadmissible but a charge of conspiracy was made by the respondent in his pleadings, and such evidence was admissible upon that branch of the case if for no other reason. Henderson J.A. stated that there were a number of other instances of inadmissible evidence but only two were mentioned before us. One was as to what was said to have been the likeness of the child to the respondent. This evidence was admissible: Wigmore, 3rd Ed. para. 166; Doe Marr v. Marr[25]. The other was that the trial judge should have advised the wife of the appellant of the protection afforded her by s. 7 of the Ontario Evidence Act. On this point I agree with what my brother Cartwright has said.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and the judgment at the trial restored.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Locke and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014In this case the appellant claimed damages for criminal conversation. At the trial before Gale J. the jury found that the respondent had committed adultery with the wife of the appellant on or about the 17th, 18th or 19th of February, 1948, and assessed the damages at $4,000. Judgment was entered accordingly but was set aside by the Court of Appeal, a new trial being directed on terms. The appellant asks that the judgment at trial be restored.\nOn the 28th of November, 1948, the appellant\u2019s wife gave birth to a daughter. The appellant pleaded that the respondent was the father of such daughter. No question as to this was put to the jury, but it would seem probable from the amount of the verdict that the jury were of the view that this fact was proved.\nIt may be stated at once that there was ample admissible evidence to support the finding of adultery. The appellant\u2019s wife testified to the commission of an act of adultery between herself and the respondent. There was evidence of other witnesses as to familiarities between them and as to opportunity. The defence was a complete denial of this charge. In addition it was alleged in the statement of defence that the appellant and his wife had \u201cschemed, connived, planned and conspired to concoct circumstances to give rise to this fictitious action\u201d for the purpose of enabling them to become possessed of a property which the appellant had purchased under agreement from the respondent.\nThe following four grounds for setting aside the judgment at the trial are mentioned in the reasons of the Court of Appeal delivered by Henderson J.A.:\u2014\n(i) Failure to charge the jury that there is a strong presumption of the legitimacy of a child born of a married woman.\n(ii) Failure to charge the jury that the registration of the child\u2019s birth raised a presumption of her legitimacy.\n(iii) Lack of evidence that three samples of blood submitted to certain tests came respectively from the plaintiff, his wife and the child.\n(iv) The wrongful admission of evidence of certain conversations between the appellant and his wife in the absence of the respondent in which the wife confessed adultery with the respondent and stated that he was the father of the child.\nThe learned justice of appeal added that there were a number of other instances of the admission of inadmissible evidence but did not specify what these were. Before us counsel for the respondent sought to support the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the following grounds in addition to the four mentioned above.\n(v) That, it having been admitted that sexual intercourse between the appellant and his wife had taken place during the period within which the child must, in the course of nature, have been conceived, no evidence should have been received tending to bastardize the child and particularly the evidence of the doctors as to certain blood tests should have been rejected.\n(vi) Falure to charge the jury correctly as to the degree of proof required to establish adultery.\n(vii) Failure of the learned trial judge to advise the wife of the appellant of the protection afforded her by section 7 of the Ontario Evidence Act.\n(viii) Wrongful admission of evidence that the child resembled the respondent.\nAs to the first ground, above set out, the learned trial judge did not in his charge make any reference to the presumption of legitimacy. Counsel for the respondent directed attention to this in the course of his objections to the charge which occupy several pages of the transcript but the learned trial judge declined to recall the jury. There is no doubt that the presumption exists. The following statements in Halsbury (2nd Edition) Vol. 2, sections 766 and 768 are fully supported by the authorities there cited:\n766. Every child born of a married woman during the subsistence of the marriage is prima facie legitimate, and the presumption of legitimacy arises also where the child is born not more than nine months after the dissolution of the marriage by death or otherwise. But in every case the husband and wife must have had opportunity of access to each other during the period in which the child could be begotten and born in the course of nature, and they must not be proved to be impotent. The presumption, however, is not a presumption juris et de jure, which cannot be rebutted, but a presumption only, which may be rebutted by evidence of circumstances proving the contrary, and such evidence must not be slight in its nature, but strong and satisfactory.\n768. The presumption of legitimacy continues notwithstanding that the wife is shown to have committed adultery with any number of men. The law will not permit an inquiry whether the husband or some other man is more likely to be the father of the child, and it must be affirmatively proved, before the child can be bastardized, that the husband did not have sexual intercourse with his wife at the time when it was conceived.\nIn the case at bar both the appellant and his wife testified that they had had sexual intercourse from time to time during the period within which the child must have been conceived but had used artificial means designed to prevent conception, such means being used sometimes by the husband, sometimes by the wife and sometimes by both. No medical evidence was tendered to indicate how effective such precautions were likely to be but it would appear that the appellant did not himself regard them as being certain to accomplish their purpose for he testified that he was \u201cstunned\u201d when his wife first told him that the child was not his. In my view on the evidence in this record the case should be treated as one in which it is established that the appellant had sexual intercourse with his wife during the period within which the child must in the course of nature have been conceived, and if the matter ended here it would have followed that the child must be held legitimate. In this case, however, the evidence of two qualified medical practitioners was to the effect that tests carried out with samples of the blood of the appellant, of his wife, and of the child indicated that if the child were born of the wife, as is admitted, then it was not merely improbable but impossible that the appellant was the father. It is not necessary to go at length into the details of the evidence. The salient feature was that the blood of the child contained a certain factor, that it was a scientific certainty that such factor must have been present in the blood of at least one of her parents, that it was not present in the blood of her mother, that it must therefore have been present in the blood of her father, that it was not present in the blood of the appellant and therefore he could not be the father. This medical evidence was not contradicted nor was it shaken or weakened in cross-examination. The doctors testified that the test described is a comparatively recent development in the science of genetics and counsel did not refer us to any case in the courts of this country or of England in which the admissibility or effect of such evidence has been considered. It appears to me to be admissible and, if accepted, to be effective to bastardize the child. No case suggests that the presumption of legitimacy will not yield to proof that it was impossible, in the course of nature, that the husband could be the father of the child. I do not think that any case prescribes a higher degree of proof in order to rebut the presumption than that required in R. v. Luffe[26]. In that case it was proved that the husband had no access to his wife from the 9th April, 1804, until two weeks before the birth of her child on 13th July, 1806. The Court,\u2014Lord Ellenborough and Grose, Lawrence and Le Blanc, JJ. were unanimous in upholding the decision that the child was illegitimate. At page 207 Lord Ellenborough said:\u2014\n* * * And therefore, if we may resort at all to such impediments arising from the natural causes adverted to, we may adopt other causes equally potent and conducive to shew the absolute physical impossibility of the husband\u2019s being the father: I will not say the improbability of his being such; for upon the ground of improbability, however strong, I should not venture to proceed.\nand further at the same page:\u2014\n* * * the general presumption will prevail, except a case of plain natural impossibility is shewn.\nAt pages 209 and 210 Lawrence J. said:\u2014\nNow without going over the whole ground of the argument again, the doctrine of the quatuor maria has been long exploded; and it has been shewn by the authorities mentioned by my lord, that imbecility from age, and natural infirmity from other causes, have always been deemed sufficient to bastardize the issue; all which evidence proceeds upon the ground of a natural impossibility that the husband should be the father of the child. Then why not give effect to any other matter which proves the same natural impossibility?\nand at page 212 Le Blanc J. said:\u2014\nBut where it can be demonstrated to be absolutely impossible, in the course of nature that the husband could be the father of the child, it does not break in upon the reason of the current of authorities, to say that the issue is illegitimate. If it does not appear but what he might have been the father, the presumption of law still holds in favour of the legitimacy. But if, as in this case, it be proved to be impossible that he should have been the father, then, within the principle of the modern cases, there is nothing to prevent us from coming to that conclusion.\nIt may be that the phrase \u201cdemonstrated to be absolutely impossible\u201d requires some modification in view of the judgments recently delivered in the House of Lords in Preston\u2011Jones v. Preston-Jones[27], but even if it were accepted without modification the evidence of the doctors in this case would appear to fall within it. The question put by Lawrence J. in R. v. Luffe (supra) \u201cThen why not give effect to any other matter which proves the same natural impossibility?\u201d appears to me when applied to this evidence to be unanswerable. I wish to make it plain that what I regard as being decisive is the fact that the evidence was to the effect that the appellant could not be the father of the child. Had the doctors testified that the result of the tests indicated that it was in the highest degree improbable, but not impossible, that the appellant be the father of the child it would, in my opinion, have been the duty of the trial judge to direct the jury that as a matter of law such evidence could not avail against the presumption. Had the learned trial judge charged the jury as to the presumption of legitimacy, as, with respect, I think he should, it would have been necessary for him to instruct the jury that if they accepted the evidence of the doctors it effectively rebutted the presumption. I can find no ground on which acting reasonably, the jury could have rejected this evidence. The witnesses were possessed of high professional qualifications and their testimony was neither contradicted by other evidence nor weakened on cross-examination. Under these circumstances, I am of opinion that the failure of the learned trial judge to deal with the presumption can not have occasioned any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. For these reasons I think that the grounds of attack upon the trial judgment numbered (i) and (v) above can not be sustained.\nFor the reasons given by my brothers Kerwin and Kellock I agree that the argument that the learned trial judge should have told the jury that the fact of the registration of the child\u2019s birth gave rise to a presumption of legitimacy can not succeed.\nAs to ground (iii), mentioned above, I am of opinion that the evidence of Dr. Fremes was sufficient to establish that the samples of blood tested came respectively from the appellant, his wife and the child. Certainly the sufficiency of their identification was not called in question at the trial. The following passage from the judgment of Robertson C.J.O. in Earnshaw v. Dominion of Canada Insurance Company[28] appears to me to be applicable:\u2014\nIn these circumstances, if counsel for appellant desired to contend that the evidence of identification was defective or insufficient because the means or method of identification was not stated, or because there was none, in my opinion the time to raise that question was when these witnesses were giving their evidence. No objection was taken that evidence of the result of the test was inadmissible because the witnesses did not state how they identified the sample, and I do not think that objection can be taken now. The evidence which the Court of Appeal regarded as inadmissible to which reference is made in ground (iv) above, was that of statements made to the appellant by his wife the effect of which may be briefly summarized as follows. On the morning after the wife\u2019s return from the nursing home some ten days after the birth of the child she was feeling upset and unhappy. The appellant was treating her with kindness and consideration and endeavouring to encourage and console her. He was either about to get her some tea or had just done so. Up to this time any thought that the child was not his was completely absent from his mind. In these circumstances the wife \u201cblurted out\u201d that she did not deserve his sympathy or kindness, that she had been unfaithful to him and that the child was not his but the respondent\u2019s. An account of this conversation was given in chief by both the appellant and his wife. No objection was taken by counsel for the respondent. In cross-examination of each of these witnesses counsel for the respondent went fully into the details of the conversation and it became apparent that he had explored the subject matter fully on his examination for discovery of the appellant. I think it may properly be inferred that even if counsel for the appellant had not dealt with the conversation in chief, it was the intention of counsel for the respondent to do so in cross-examination. Under that circumstance and in view of the fact that there was ample other admissible evidence to fully support the verdict I do not think that it could be held that any substantial wrong or miscarriage had resulted from the admission of this evidence in chief. I am, however, of opinion that the evidence was admissible on two grounds, although not, of course, as evidence of the truth of the matter stated. I think the evidence of the wife\u2019s statement was admissible on the principle on which the letters of the Countess of Aylesford stating that an adulterer was the father of her child were admitted in The Aylesford Peerage[29]. At page 10 of the report of that judgment the Earl of Selborne said:\u2014\nThese declarations are facts as well as statements. It is a fact that for some purpose or other the mother wrote a letter containing such statements at such a time. Your Lordships will not take them as proving the fact; but the fact that the mother did write such a letter, at such a time and for such a purpose, as it appears to me, is a thing which, on the principles which were certainly acted upon in Morris v. Davies[30] (and which appear to me to be sound principles, and quite consistent with the rule), ought not to be excluded from consideration.\nIn the case at bar the fact that the wife made such a statement to her husband at such a time and under such circumstances was, I think, a relevant item of circumstantial evidence falling within the reasoning of the passage just quoted.\nThe second ground on which I consider the evidence was admissible is that stated in Phipson on Evidence (8th Edition) at page 480, where after stating the rule that evidence that a witness had made a previous statement similar to his testimony in court is now generally inadmissible to confirm his testimony the learned author lists certain exceptions, the first being:\u2014\nSuch statements are, however, receivable in the cases mentioned below, not to prove the truth of the facts asserted, but merely to show that the witness is consistent with himself: (1) where the witness is charged with having recently fabricated the story, e.g., from some motive of interest or friendship, it may be shown both by the witness himself and the person to whom it was addressed, that he had made a similar statement before such motive existed.\nIn my opinion this extract is supported by the authorities cited and is a correct statement of the law. In R. v. Coyle[31], Erie J. said:\u2014\nThe point is to prevent the observation that the witness has now invented the story.\nIn Flanagan v. Fahy[32] at pages 381 and 382, Sir Ignatius O\u2019Brien expressly approved the statement from Phipson on Evidence, quoted above, which had appeared ipsissimis verbis in an earlier edition. In the case at bar the respondent pleaded that the charge of adultery made against him was a fiction concocted in pursuance of a conspiracy to obtain damages from him. He led evidence in an endeavour to support this allegation. This plea was apparently pressed by counsel for the respondent in addressing the jury for the learned trial judge deals with it at some length in his charge and refers to it as having been \u201calleged most strongly\u201d. It would have been proper for the learned trial judge to point out to the jury that the statements made by the wife to the appellant were not in themselves direct evidence of the truth of the facts stated, but he was not asked to do so, and the omission appears to me to be of little importance in the circumstances of this particular case, the wife having given evidence at the trial and having testified as to the truth of all the facts which she had related in the conversation in question. I cannot think that the omission referred to could have caused any substantial wrong or miscarriage.\nThe next ground of attack upon the trial judgment, numbered (vi) above, is that the learned trial judge should have charged the jury that before they could find that the respondent had committed adultery with the appellant\u2019s wife they must be satisfied of that fact not on a mere preponderance of evidence but beyond a reasonable doubt. This point was taken in the notice of appeal and was fully argued before us but the Court of Appeal did not find it necessary to deal with it. We were assisted by an able argument on the question as to the degree of proof of adultery required in Ontario in an action for divorce and the question whether the same degree of proof is required in an action such as this for damages for criminal conversation in which proof of adultery is an essential part of the cause of action but neither the status of the defendant nor the legitimacy of a child are directly affected by the judgment in the sense that either would be res judicata if, for example, the wife of the defendant were to bring action against him for divorce or the child should claim to inherit on the death intestate of the appellant. I do not find it necessary to decide these questions.\nIn the case at bar if the jury accepted the medical evidence, as in my opinion they must have done, the facts that the appellant\u2019s wife had committed adultery with someone and that the child was illegitimate were proved; beyond all reasonable doubt. The learned trial judge made it plain to the jury that the medical evidence in no way implicated the respondent. He explained to them that to succeed the plaintiff must prove that the respondent had committed adultery with his wife. As to the degree of proof required he put the matter as follows:\u2014\n* * * Now, summing up what I have just said to you, and having regard to the evidence that has been given here, the two issues to be determined by you gentlemen, as I understand it, are these: first, has the plaintiff established by a preponderance of credible evidence that Charlie Brown committed adultery with the plaintiff\u2019s wife and, secondly, if so, has Welstead sustained a loss or damage or injury as a result of the commission of that adultery. That is why, gentlemen, the questions are framed in the manner in which they are, and which I read to you. The third issue is, what is the amount of the damage. I will come to that later.\nIn all these issues the burden of proof rests upon the plaintiff Welstead to show a preponderance of evidence in favour of what he asserts. Adultery should be strictly proved, and when you come to consider whether or not it has been established you should exercise a cautious discretion in the matter, because,\u2014apart from some of the matters which I will mention to you briefly\u2014really the only evidence of adultery comes from the lips of Mrs. Welstead. Since it is a serious matter charged, as I say, you should proceed with caution before you decide that adultery has been established. So that to that extent there is a rather heavy duty cast upon the plaintiff to establish his case.\nAssuming, without deciding, that the learned trial judge should have instructed the jury that a somewhat heavier burden lay upon the plaintiff in this regard, I am of opinion, after a consideration of all the evidence, that it can not be said that any miscarriage of justice resulted from the use of the language which he in fact employed.\nDealing with ground (vii) above, it does not appear in the record that the learned trial judge advised the wife of the appellant of the protection afforded to her by the proviso in s. 7 of the Ontario Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 119, reading as follows:\u2014\nThe parties to any proceeding instituted in consequence of adultery and the husbands and wives of such parties shall be competent to give evidence in such proceeding; provided that no witness in any proceeding whether a party to the suit or not, shall be liable to be asked or bound to answer any question tending to show that he or she is guilty of adultery unless such witness shall have already given evidence in the same proceeding in disproof of his or her alleged adultery.\nCounsel referred us to two divorce cases, Laffin v. Laffin[33], and Waugh v. Waugh[34], in which the Court of Appeal for Nova Scotia decided that evidence of a witness as to his own adultery given without objection in answer to questions put to him was inadmissible. It is not necessary to consider whether those cases were rightly decided. The relevant statutory provision is not identical with the Ontario section quoted above, or the corresponding statutory provision in force in England. The Nova Scotia section is s. 38 of the Evidence Act of that Province as amended by 1936 c. 35, s. 1, and reads as follows:\u2014\nThe parties to an action or proceeding instituted in consequence of adultery, and their husbands and wives, shall be competent, but not compellable to give evidence; but the husband or wife, if competent only under this Chapter, shall not be asked or bound to answer any question tending to show that he or she has been guilty of adultery, unless he or she shall have already given evidence in the same action or proceeding in disproof of his or her alleged adultery or unless permission to ask such question is given by the Presiding Judge.\nIt will be observed that this section in terms forbids the asking of any question tending to show that the witness has been guilty of adultery unless one of the prescribed conditions exists, while the Ontario section relieves the witness from liability to be asked such questions.\nIn my opinion the law of Ontario is correctly stated by Logie J. in Elliott v. Elliott[35], particularly at page 212 where he says:\u2014\nNevertheless the privilege is the privilege of the witness, and if not taken advantage of by him or her, the evidence both at the trial and upon examination is admissible.\nThis is supported by the unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal in England in Allen v. Allen and Bell[36], where Lindley L.J. says:\u2014\nThe evidence with regard to the adultery is not rendered inadmissible, but protection is afforded to the witness from being questioned on the subject if the witness claims protection; but it is for the witness, and the witness only, to make the claim.\nI am in agreement with the statement of Logie J. in Elliott v. Elliott (supra) at page 211:\u2014\nAs a matter of practice, the Judge, before any evidence is given, should inform the witness of the privilege given to him or her by sec. 7, and it would be well for counsel to advise the witness before he or she goes into the box at the trial or before the party is sworn in an examination for discovery, that he or she is not liable to be asked or bound to answer any question tending to show that he or she is guilty of adultery unless such witness falls within the exception provided by the section itself.\nIn the case at bar it was, I think, obvious that the wife had decided to give evidence as to her own adultery, and I regard the omission to call her attention to the terms of the statute as unimportant. As to ground number (viii), referred to above, I think it clear that evidence that the child resembled the defendant was admissible. In Doe Marr v. Marr[37], Macaulay C.J., with the concurrence of McLean and Sullivan JJ. stated that such evidence is admissible when relevant to the issue. In the case at bar it was clearly relevant. In Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Edition, section 166, page 624, the learned author says:\u2014\nThe English practice seems always to have admitted this evidence without question.\nSince, in my opinion, all the grounds of attack upon the trial judgment fail it becomes unnecessary to deal with the terms on which the Court of Appeal directed a new trial, but I think it proper to say that I Have been unable to find in the record justification of the criticism of counsel who appeared for the plaintiff at the trial. Even had the order for a new trial been upheld, in my opinion, the terms imposed upon the plaintiff could not have been allowed to stand. There was no room for any suggestion that the action was frivolous or vexatious and I know of no precedent for the order made. Cases arise from time to time in which the Court of Appeal in ordering a new trial will order a party to pay the costs of the former trial and of the Appeal in any event, but to make payment of such costs a condition precedent of the plaintiff\u2019s right to have his action tried might well result in a denial of justice.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge with costs throughout.\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014The first ground upon which the Court of Appeal acted in setting aside the judgment at trial was misdirection in their view, on the part of the learned trial judge, in failing to direct the jury with respect to the presumption of legitimacy and that the burden resting upon the appellant, in order to the displacement of the presumption was to adduce evidence producing in the minds of the jury a moral certainty.\nIn order to establish adultery in fact on the part of his wife, the appellant adduced evidence as to the blood analysis of himself, his wife and the child, thus directly challenging the legitimacy of the child. On that issue the law is, I think, clear. In Morris v. Davies[38], Lord Cottenham L.C., quoting the unanimous opinion of the judges in the Banbury Peerage case, said at p. 215:\u2014\nThat in every case where a child is born in lawful wedlock, the husband not being separated from his wife by a decree of divorce, sexual intercourse is presumed to have taken place between the husband and wife, until that presumption is encountered by such evidence as proves to the satisfaction of those who are to decide the question, that such sexual intercourse did not take place at any time, when by such intercourse the husband could, according to the laws of nature, be the father of such child.\nLord Cottenham went on to say:\nIn the absence of all evidence, either on the one side or on the other, the law would presume that such sexual intercourse did take place.\nAfter referring to the case of Head v. Head[39], he also said:\n* * * all that is said by the present Master of the Rolls is, that the Court which is to be satisfied that sexual intercourse did not take place, must be so satisfied, not upon a mere balance of probabilities, but upon evidence which must be such as to exclude all doubt, that is, of course, all reasonable doubt, in the minds of the Court or jury to whom that question is submitted.\nWhile it is now provided by R.S.O. 1950, c. 119, s. 6 that\n* * * a husband or a wife may in any action, give evidence that he or she did or did not have sexual intercourse with the other party to the marriage at any time or within any period of time before or during the marriage,\nI find nothing in this legislation which destroys the existence of the presumption on the one hand, or lowers the standard of proof as laid down in the authorities referred to. In my view, a child born in lawful wedlock is still presumed to be a legitimate child, and the presumption is to be overborne only by evidence excluding reasonable doubt. All that the statute does is to admit certain evidence which was previously excluded. The presumption is based upon a rule of public policy and its application is not limited, as argued by the appellant, to cases involving status of the parties.\nIt is argued for the respondent that, unless non-access be proven, all evidence directed to establishing the illegitimacy is inadmissible, but I find no such implied condition in the statute. Moreover, the statute has nothing to say as to the admissibility or otherwise of the medical evidence which was adduced on behalf of the appellant and in my opinion it is not to be excluded on the basis of the rule of the common law. That rule grew up because of the then state of scientific knowledge, in which condition of things, a jury would, as pointed out by Lord Dunedin in Russell\u2019s case[40] at pp. 726\u20117, be faced with an impossible task. For that reason the law refused to permit any entry upon such an inquiry. If such evidence had not been given in the case at bar, then the evidence with respect to the question of legitimacy, even taking into consideration the evidence of the spouses themselves, might very well not have been, in the opinion of the jury, sufficient to remove all reasonable doubt. But with the medical evidence, if accepted by the jury, there could be no question of reasonable doubt. The illustration put forward by Lord Sumner in his dissenting opinion in Russell\u2019s case at p. 741 is apt:\u2014\nIf, both spouses being white themselves and of indubitably white ancestry on both sides, the wife bears a mulatto child of marked negro paternity, I do not see what need there is of further testimony about access, and I suppose (at least I hope) that common sense would prevail over presumption.\nIn my opinion, the medical evidence in the case at bar, if accepted by the jury, was of equal cogency with that suggested by Lord Sumner, and the omission of a direction to the jury as to their being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt does not call for a new trial. If the evidence was in fact not accepted by the jury, then the direction actually given by the learned trial judge was adequate with relation to the other evidence on the issue of adultery. The evidence as to the paternity of the child was, of course, negative evidence and did not go further than to make out adultery in fact on the part of the wife of the appellant. In my opinion, therefore, it is not shown that there was any substantial wrong or miscarriage occasioned by the misdirection complained of, such as is required by R.S.O. 1950, c. 190, s. 28(1) before a verdict may be set aside.\nI do not think effect ought to be given to the objection as to lack of proof that the appellant, his wife and the child were the subject of the blood tests as to which the medical evidence was given. In view of the course of the trial where no such objection was there raised, I think it is to be taken that the question of identity was, by both parties, treated as established.\nThe Court of Appeal was further of the view that the trial judge erred in failing to tell the jury that the fact that the birth of the child was registered under The Vital Statistics Act, raised a presumption of legitimacy under s. 6, subsection (3) of R.S.O. 1937, c. 88.\nIn the first place, the statute referred to by the court below is not the relevant statute, but rather c. 97 of the statutes of 1948. By s. 38, subsection (1) of that statute, a birth certificate shall contain only (a) the name of the child, (b) the date of birth, (c) place of birth, (d) sex, (e) date of registration, and (f) registration number. The exhibit here in question contained no more. By s. 41 subsection (1), such a certificate is admissible as prima facie evidence \u201cof the facts certified to be recorded.\u201d Such facts do not bear upon the parentage of the child, and moreover it is provided by subsection (4) of s. 41 that notwithstanding subsection (1), no birth certificate shall be admissible in evidence to affect a presumption of legitimacy.\nThe last ground on which the judgment below was placed was error in the admission of conversations between the appellant and his wife with respect to the latter\u2019s misconduct. This evidence, given by both the appellant and his wife when called as a witness for the appellant, was not objected to. Not only so, but the respondent cross-examined both witnesses with respect to this subject matter, and there is ground for the inference that the respondent did not fail to object through inadvertence. The respondent had obtained, on examination of the appellant for discovery, his evidence on this subject in which he had stated that he had been informed by his wife that the adultery had taken place in March. This part of the discovery was used in the cross-examination of the appellant for the purpose of discrediting the evidence adduced on behalf of the appellant to the effect that the adultery had taken place in February. In addition, counsel for the respondent at the trial expressly agreed with the learned trial judge that the evidence of the wife as to what the appellant had said to her after her disclosure was admissible although not in proof of the act of adultery itself.

Kulchar, [1952] 1 S.C.R. 330\nDate: 1951-12-17\nHarry Marsh (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nAlex Kulchar (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1951: October 15, 16; 1951: December 17.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kellock, Estey, Locke and Cartwright JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN.\nAutomobile\u2014Master and servant\u2014Car entrusted by owner to wife who put employee in charge for limited purpose not including driving\u2014Whether possession given employee\u2014Negligence of employee in driving\u2014Whether owner has statutory liability\u2014Whether car wrongfully taken out of wife's possession\u2014Vehicles Act, 1945 (Sask.), c. 98, s. 141(1).\nBy virtue of s. 141(1) of the Vehicles Act, 1945 (Sask.), c. 98, the owner of a car is liable for damage caused by the driver's negligence \"unless the motor vehicle had been stolen from the owner or otherwise wrongfully taken out of his possession or out of the possession of any person entrusted by him with the care thereof\".\nAppellant's wife was entrusted by him with the care of his truck for a trip in which she was accompanied by their farm hand. At her destination, she left the key in the ignition and told the farm hand \"to look after the car so no kids could touch it\". Although the latter had never driven a car for his employer nor did he have an operator's licence, he decided to drive it to a coffee shop a short distance away. He stated that his reason for driving it there was so that he might continue to watch it. Owing to his negligence, a pedestrian was injured. The action against the appellant was dismissed by the trial judge but maintained by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan.\nHeld (Estey and Cartwright JJ. dissenting), that the appeal should be allowed as the appellant has met the burden placed upon him by the statute.\nPer Rinfret C.J., Kellock and Locke JJ.: The farm hand was in the position of a watchman or guard and not that of one to whom possession had been given. When he moved the car for purposes of his own convenience, he took actual physical possession of it, and that was a wrongful taking of possession within the exception in s. 141(1) of the Act.\nPer Estey J. (dissenting) : The section Contemplates that the owner is to be relieved of liability only where the driver has exercised a dominion or control inconsistent with the possession of a person in the position of the wife. No such case was made here. Not only did he not deprive the wife of possession but, on the contrary, he sought to continue his supervision in order that her possession would neither be disturbed nor damaged.\nPer Cartwright J. (dissenting) : The farm hand was not given possession of the truck but only the custody of it. The truck was never taken out of the wife's possession, since the farm hand's lawful custody could be converted into wrongful possession only if there was an intention on his part to hold the truck as his own and to the wife's exclusion, and no such finding would be consistent with the facts. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 1, reversing the decision of the trial judge and holding; the appellant, as owner of the car, liable for the damages caused by the negligent driving of his employee.\nG. H. Yule K.C. and E. M. Woolliams for the appellant. The contention of the appellant is that there was no finding by the trial judge that the wife gave any instructions to the farm hand with respect to the truck. The trial judge only assumed that there had been instructions. If there were no instructions as contended, then the truck was stolen. There is express denial that such instructions were ever given. Assuming that there had been instructions, there is no evidence that the farm hand ever agreed to carry them out. The fact that he was in the general employment of the appellant is not relevant.\nBut even if there were such instructions, the owner cannot be held liable since the farm hand was not put in possession but only given the custody. Smith v. Webb 2 is relied on. When he started to drive he took possession away or out of the owner. The word \"wrongfully\" in the section, means that there was no consent express or implied. He never had possession within the concept of that word in Vancouver Motors-U Drive Ltd. v. Terry 3.\nThe true interpretation of the section is that if an owner delivers possession to anyone for the purpose of the vehicle being driven, then he is liable for the damage and it makes no difference if the person so entrusted drives in violation of the instructions of the owner.\nCases at common law as to liability of the master for the acts of the servant are not helpful, since under the section, the master would have been liable no matter for what purpose the servant drove the vehicle.\nBut cases more pertinent at comman law are cases where the servant improperly took the master's vehicle, such as: Halperin v. Bulling 4, Limpus v. London General Omnibus Co. 5, and Beard v. London General Omnibus Co. 6. If, at common law, there would have been no liability on the appellant for the reason that the servant wrongfully drove the vehicle, then the language of the section cannot be strained to impose liability, in virtue of the rule of strict construction of a statute that tends to modify the common law.\nNo argument can be advanced that when he moved the truck, he was acting in the interests of the master, as there is no such finding by the trial judge. Even if he decided to take it to where he was going in breach of his duty to watch it where it was, he still would be taking it improperly if his reason for taking it was to watch it at a new location to which he wished to go for his own private purposes.\nF. B. Zurowski for the respondent. A perusal of the various amendments of the Act discloses that the legislature has been enlarging on the common law liability of the owners of vehicles. Therefore, the common law is not of assistance to this case. The question of the extent of the owner's liability, once it is clear the driver was placed in possession was dealt with in Sebda v. Hupka & Buchkowski 7. Asking somebody to watch the car amounted to giving possession of it, in the circumstances here. There is no evidence to contradict the evidence of the farm hand respecting the instructions. The trial judge has held that he exceeded his instructions and that he had no authority to drive the car. That is a finding of credibility which is supported by the evidence and by the circumstances.\nThere is an essential difference in law between the liability of the owner for the acts of one who has been placed in possession of the vehicle and exceeds his authority by moving it, and his liability for the acts of one who obtains possession of the vehicle either by theft or wrongful means (Bailey v. Manchester Sheffielf & Lecolnshire Ry. Co. 8.\nThe following authorities are submitted on the question of the owner's liability: Vancouver Motors-U Drive Ltd. v. Terry (supra), Volkert v. Diamond Truck Co. 9, Lloyd v. Dominion Fire 10, Bobby v. Chodiker 11 and Smith v. Drewrys Ltd. 12. The case of Smith v. Webb cited by the appellant (supra) is of no assistance here. The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kellock and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nKellock J. :\u2014This appeal arises under the provisions of sub-s. (1) of s. 141 of the Saskatchewan Vehicles Act, 1945, c. 98, the material part of which reads as follows:\n\u2026 when any loss, damage or injury is caused to any person by a motor vehicle \u2026 the owner thereof shall also be liable to the same extent as the driver unless at the time of the incident causing the loss, damage or injury, the motor vehicle had been stolen from the owner or otherwise wrongfully taken out of his possession or out of the possession of any person intrusted by him with the care thereof.\nThe respondent was injured by a motor vehicle driven by one Beukert, a farm hand in the employ of the appellant, the owner of the car. So far as his employment is concerned, however, Beukert had nothing to do with the motor car, and had no license to drive. On the evening in question, he had merely accompanied the appellant's wife in the car to a supper in the village of Mistatim, which was to be followed by a dance. On arriving at the village, Mrs. Marsh left the key of the car in the ignition for the reason that, as she explains, she had not her purse with her and was afraid she might lose the key if she took it with her. While Mrs. Marsh denies she spoke to Beukert about the car at all, he says she did, and that the substance of what she said was,\nshe told me to look after it so no kids \u2026 could touch it.\nMrs. Marsh and one or two friends who had accompanied her, went into the supper, as did Beukert, and some time later, it is suggested when Mrs. Marsh was at the dance, Beukert got into the car and drove it a short distance to a restaurant, in front of which the accident in which the respondent was injured, occurred.\nThe learned trial judge accepted Beukert's version of what had been said by Mrs. Marsh with respect to the car on their arrival at the village, and on that evidence, held that Beukert had not been given possession of the car and that in driving it as he did, he had wrongfully taken it out of her possession. In the Court of Appeal 13, Proctor J.A., who delivered the judgment of himself, Gordon, McNiven and Culliton JJ.A., construed this judgment as proceeding on the ground that possession of the car had been given by Mrs. Marsh to Beukert, and that the latter in driving it, had merely exceeded his authority. Martin C.J.S., who delivered a separate judgment, took a similar view.\nWith respect, I do not think the trial judgment is open to such a construction. The finding of the learned judge is an express one that Beukert \"wrongfully took the truck out of the possession of Mrs. Marsh,\" which presupposes that possession had never in fact been delivered to him. He says that on the basis of what was said by Mrs. Marsh, all Beukert had to do was to \"keep his eye on the truck and leave it where it was.\" In my view, the evidence is not open to any other interpretation, and Beukert's position, on his own story, was that of a watchman or guard, and not that of one to whom possession had been given. Accordingly, when he drove the car, that was, as against Mrs. Marsh and the appellant, a wrongful taking of possession.\nRespondent's counsel contended that it was within the contemplation of Mrs. Marsh that the car should be driven by Beukert. In my opinion, this contention is not open upon the words used. Moreover, Beukert admits that, to him, they had no such implication. It is worth while quoting, on this point, a further extract from his evidence:\nQ. But you got in the truck?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Knowing that you should not drive it?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And where were you going with it?\nA. Going over to the cafe and have coffee.\nComing to the statute, the owner is not liable if it be shown that the motor vehicle had been stolen from him or \"otherwise wrongfully taken out of his possession,\" or \"out of the possession of any person entrusted by him with the care thereof.\"\nThe word \"possession\" in English law is, as has often been pointed out, a most ambiguous word. As most often used, however, it imports actual physical possession. As stated by Erie C.J. in Bourne v. Fosbrooke 14,\n\"In most instances, it is considered to import the manual custody of the chattel.\" In The Tubantia 15, Sir Henry Duke, P., said:\nI have also taken this to be a true proposition in English law: a thing taken by a person of his own motion and for himself, and subject in his hands, or under his control, to the uses of which it is capable, is in that person's possession.\nWhen a motor car is stolen from the owner, the thief takes actual physical possession, and thus takes it out of the possession of the owner, although the right to possession remains with the latter. That this is the idea in contemplation of the statute is shown by the use of the phrase, \"or otherwise \u2026 taken out of his possession.\" The statute also contemplates that the person to whom the care of the car has been entrusted, has been put into possession by the owner, as it deals with the wrongful taking out of the possession of such person. When actual physical possession is taken of a motor car by the wrongful act of another, it is, in the contemplation of the statute, taken out of the possession of the owner or such other person.\nThere is no doubt that when Beukert moved the car for purposes of his own convenience, he took actual physical possession as above described, thereby depriving Mrs. Marsh of possession. In my opinion, this was a wrongful taking.\nIn Pollock and Wright on \"possession in the Common Law,\" the authors deal at p. 120 with the case of a person having a right to a particular chattel which may or may not coincide with the right of ownership, and secondly with the case of mere physical possession without either ownership or right to possession. They point out at p. 121 that a violation of the first of these relations is a conversion or \"wrongful detention,\" while a violation of the second is a trespass. In the latter case, if a stranger take the chattel away without leave, the possession is \"wrongfully\" changed and the former possessor, whether he be owner or not, can bring either trover or trespass de bonis asportatis, and if the trespass be committed animo furandi, the trespasser may be prosecuted for theft from the possessor. A wrongful taking in circumstances such as are here present is also rendered a crime by s. 285(3) of the Criminal Code. The difference between such wrongful taking and theft is, of course, the presence in the latter case of fraudulent intent. I think, therefore, the appellant met the burden placed upon him by the statute, and that the action was properly dismissed at the trial. I would therefore allow the appeal with costs here and below, and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nEstey J. (dissenting):\u2014The appellant, owner of a 1940 Ford truck, appeals from a judgment of the Court of Appeal in Saskatchewan 16 under which, by virtue of the provisions of sec. 141(1) of the Vehicles Act (S. of Sask. 1945, c. 98), he has been held liable for damage suffered by the respondent when an employee of his, Beukert, was driving the truck. The contention of appellant is that Beukert had wrongfully taken the truck and, therefore, that he, as the owner, is not liable within the exception to sec. 141(1). Sec. 141(1) reads as follows:\n141(1) 1. Subject to the provisions of subsection (2), when any loss, damage or injury is caused to any person by a motor vehicle, the person driving it at any time shall be liable for the loss, damage or injury, if it was caused by his negligence or improper conduct, and the owner thereof shall also be liable to the same extent as the driver unless at the time of the incident causing the loss, damage or injury the motor vehicle had been stolen from the owner or otherwise wrongfully taken out of his possession or out of the possession of any person intrusted by him with the care thereof.\nThe accident occurred about 8:30 Saturday evening, September 6, 1947. Beukert had been employed for a month prior thereto upon appellant's farm, where it was no part of his duty to drive, nor did he drive, this truck or any motor vehicle. In fact, he did not have a driver's licence. On the evening in question the appellant's wife drove the truck, with her sister-in-law and Beukert as passengers, into Mistatim to attend a fowl supper and social evening. When she parked the truck in Mistatim, having left her purse at home, she left the keys in the ignition because she thought they were safer there than in her pocket. Beukert deposed that Mrs. Marsh, as she parked the truck, asked him to look after it and, at another time, added \"so no kids could touch it.\" This was denied by Mrs. Marsh and, in effect, by her sister-in-law. Beukert, when the truck was parked, separated from the women. About 8:30 he decided to have a cup of coffee and, as he says, was moving the truck about 125 feet to a spot where he could watch it from the inside of the coffee shop. It was in the course of so moving the truck that he struck and seriously injured the respondent.\nMr. Yule contended that the learned trial judge did not make a finding of fact to the effect that Mrs. Marsh had requested Beukert to keep the \"kids\" away from the truck. The learned trial judge first stated his conclusion to the effect that Beukert had wrongfully taken the truck and then stated: \"The evidence is this,\" and went on to state certain facts, including \"Mrs. Marsh said to Beukert to take care of the truck and keep the kids away or something to that effect.\" The learned trial judge did not suggest that he was summarizing the evidence, or in any way reviewing it, and, when read as a whole, it appears that he was setting forth the facts which he found in support of the conclusion he had already stated. I am, therefore, in agreement with Mr. Justice Procter, with whom Mr. Justice McNiven and Mr. Justice Culliton agreed, that \"the trial judge accepted Beukert's story.\"\nThat the injury resulted from the negligent driving of Beukert there is no question and no appeal is taken from the judgment rendered against him.\nSection 141(1) imposes upon appellant liability \"to the same extent\" as upon Beukert for the latter's \"negligence or improper conduct\" in driving the truck. It then provides, by way of an exception, that the appellant may be relieved of that liability if it be established that Beukert had \"stolen\" or \"otherwise wrongfully taken\" the truck \"out of the possession of any person intrusted by him with the care thereof.\"\nThat the appellant, as owner, had intrusted Mrs. Marsh with the care of the truck and that she was, therefore, a person in possession thereof, within the meaning of the section, was not contested.\nMrs. Marsh, when she requested Beukert to take care of the truck, as found by the learned trial judge, retained possession thereof. The appellant's contention is that Beukert, in moving the truck as aforesaid, took it out of her possession within the meaning of sec. 141(1).\nThat Beukert had neither a licence nor permission to drive the truck, and, therefore, in doing so acted wrongfully is apparent. That his conduct in this regard ought not to be condoned must be conceded. That he acted wrongfully, however, is not sufficient. It must be established, in order for the appellant to succeed, that Beukert's conduct was such that it brought him within the section as one who had \"otherwise wrongfully taken\" the truck \"out of the possession of\" Mrs. Marsh. The words \"otherwise wrongfully taken \u2026 out of the possession of\" are words, apart from any context, sufficiently wide and comprehensive to include many wrongs, but, as here used in association with the word \"stolen,\" they must be given a more restricted meaning. \"Theft\" is defined in sec. 347 of the Criminal Code as\nthe act of fraudulently and without colour or right taking \u2026 with intent,\n(a) to deprive the owner \u2026\nThe specific intent essential in sec. 347 of the Criminal Code is not required under that portion of sec. 141(1) with which we are here concerned. In both sections there must be a taking. The Legislature, by its language in sec. 141 (1), contemplates more than an interference with possession sufficient to constitute a mere trespass, even if that include a moving of the motor vehicle. It would rather appear that in using the words \"wrongfully taken \u2026 out of the possession of\" the Legislature intended the owner should be relieved of liability only where the driver has exercised a dominion or control inconsistent with the possession of a person in the position of Mrs. Marsh. The evidence accepted by the learned trial judge does not support such a taking.\nWhether, within the meaning of sec. 285(3), Beukert's moving of the truck constituted a taking with intent to operate or drive need not be here ascertained. It is sufficient to observe that a prosecution under that section does not raise any question of taking out of possession, but rather of a taking without the consent of the owner. The owner's consent is an essential factor under that section and as it is in sections corresponding to sec. 141(1) in some of the other provinces. In the statute here in question it is the wrongfully taking out of the possession which involves quite distinct issues.\nBeukert was employed by Mrs. Marsh. He had been requested to give supervision to the truck by Mrs. Marsh and when, in the course of the evening, he desired a cup of coffee he decided not to neglect, but rather continue, his supervision of the truck by moving it. That in the course of so moving it he inflicted the unfortunate injuries for which damages are here claimed does not alter or affect his conduct in relation to the question of whether Mrs. Marsh was deprived of her possession of the truck. Beukert, in moving the truck, did not assert any control or dominion over it inconsistent with the possession of Mrs. Marsh; nor did he, in fact, deprive her of her possession. On the contrary, he sought to continue his supervision in order that her possession would neither be disturbed nor damaged. It cannot, therefore, be said that the conduct of Beukert constituted him as one who had \"otherwise wrongfully taken\" the truck \"out of the possession of\" Mrs. Marsh, within the meaning of sec. 141(1).\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nCartwright J. (dissenting) :\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 17 allowing an appeal from a judgment of McKercher J. and directing judgment to be entered in favour of the respondent for the amount of damages assessed by the learned trial judge.\nThe detailed facts of the case are stated in the judgment of my brother Estey and certain relevant portions of the evidence are set out in the judgment of Procter J.A. but in order to make plain the grounds upon which my opinion is based it is desirable that I should summarize what I regard as material.\nIt was not contested that the respondent's injuries were caused by the negligence of Beukert in driving a motor truck owned by the appellant or that the possession and care of such truck had been entrusted by the appellant to his wife on the evening of the accident. The following findings of fact appear to me to have been made by the learned trial judge and concurred in by the Court of Appeal and to be supported by the evidence, (i) Beukert was at the time of the accident and had been for some weeks prior thereto employed by the appellant, (ii) During this time he had not operated the motor vehicle which injured the respondent or any other motor vehicle belonging to the appellant. (iii) Beukert was not licensed to drive a motor vehicle, (iv) On the evening of the accident the wife of the appellant had left the key in the truck and had told Beukert \"to look after the truck so that no kids could touch it.\" (v) While Beukert was taking care of the truck he wanted a cup of coffee and decided to get this at a coffee shop, distant 125 feet from where the truck was standing. (vi) He decided to drive the truck to the coffee shop so that he could continue to keep the truck in his sight through the window while having his coffee, (vii) Beukert thought he was justified in doing this, (viii) The respondent was struck by the truck just as Beukert was completing the journey of 125 feet.\nIt was not seriously suggested that under these circumstances Beukert could be said to have stolen the truck but the learned trial judge was of the view that the result in law of the facts stated was that Beukert at the moment of the accident had wrongfully taken the truck out of the possession of a person (Mrs. Marsh) entrusted by the appellant with the care thereof, within the meaning of section 141(1) of the Vehicles Act, S. of Sask., 1945, c. 98.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Procter J.A., with whom McNiven and Culliton JJ.A. agreed, proceeds on the basis that Mrs. Marsh had given possession of the truck to Beukert and that consequently although he had exceeded his authority in driving it he could not be said to have taken it wrongfully out of her possession. The learned Chief Justice of Saskatchewan, with whom Gordon J.A. agrees, speaks of Beukert having been \"put in charge of the truck for a limited purpose by Mrs. Marsh\" and also says in part: \"Beukert was in possession of the truck and in a position to drive it.\" The Court were unanimous in allowing the appeal.\nI am in agreement with the Court of Appeal as to the result and, bearing in mind the often repeated statement that \"possession is a word of ambiguous meaning\" (vide e.g., Halsbury, 2nd Edition, Vol. 25, pages 194 et seq), I am not prepared to differ from the reasons given, but it seems to me that I should have reached the same conclusion on a somewhat different view as to the legal result of the facts found. I incline to the view that Mrs. Marsh did not give Beukert possession of the truck but only the custody of it. As is said in Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law, 9th Edition, at page 304 : \"A moveable thing is in the possession of \u2026 the master of any servant, who has the custody of it for him, and from whom he can take it at pleasure.\" If this be the right view, in my opinion, Beukert at no time took the truck out of Mrs. Marsh's possession at all. In order that Beukert's lawful custody should be converted into wrongful possession it would be necessary to find an intention on his part to hold the truck, at least temporarily, as his own and to the exclusion of Mrs. Marsh. Such a finding would, I think, be quite inconsistent with the facts stated above. Beukert's intention in moving the truck was not to take it from Mrs. Marsh's possession but rather to enable him to continue to keep the custody of it with which he had been entrusted while at the same time enjoying the cup of coffee which he desired.\nIt seems to me that there is danger of confusion arising from the facts that the moving of a truck by an inexperienced driver is always attended with the possibility of causing damage and that Beukert was not licensed to drive. As was pointed out by Fisher J.A. speaking for the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Thompson v. Bourchier 18, the operation of an automobile is not necessarily synonymous with the possession of an automobile. It could not, I think, be successfully argued that if instead of committing the truck to Beukert's care Mrs. Marsh had handed him her suit-case to look after and he had carried it less than fifty paces to purchase a cup of coffee that he would have thereby wrongfully taken the suit-case out of her possession.\nFor the appellant it was argued that when Beukert commenced to drive the truck he thereby deprived Mrs. Marsh of the \"actual physical possession\" thereof and that this was wrongful as he had neither the consent of the owner nor the license to drive required by law. The fallacy of this argument is that at the moment when Beukert commenced to drive Mrs. Marsh did not have the \"actual physical possession\"; she was physically absent; and if the word \"possession\" in section 141(1) is synonymous with the words \"actual physical possession\" as used in this argument then Mrs. Marsh had transferred such possession to Beukert when she committed the truck to his care and went about her business. Unless and until it appears that the truck had been taken out of her possession an inquiry as to whether the conduct of the alleged taker was wrongful is irrelevant.\nIt was further submitted on behalf of the appellant that Beukert took the car out of Mrs. Marsh's possession because he drove it solely for his own purposes thereby evidencing an intention to hold it, at least for a time, as his own. But this argument fails on the evidence and on the findings of fact. Beukert's reason for moving himself to the coffee shop was for his own purpose of drinking a cup of coffee. He could and normally would have fulfilled that purpose' without moving the truck. His reason for driving the truck to the coffee shop, instead of temporarily abandoning it, was so that he might continue to watch it while having the coffee.\nIn my opinion on the facts as found the appellant is not within the exception from liability which the section provides.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Van Blaricom & Woolliams.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

The city undertook in return to convey the lands upon which the depot was to be built and to issue to the company debentures for the sum of $200,000. The agreement further provided that upon the fulfilment by the C.P.R. of the conditions stipulated in the by-law, all property then owned or that might thereafter be owned by the company \"within the limits of the City of Winnipeg for railway purposes, or in connection there-with shall be forever free and exempt from all municipal taxes, rates, and levies, and assessments of every nature and kind.\"\nThe obligations assumed by both parties were fulfilled and no question arose until 1948 when the City assessed all the lands and buildings, including a hotel and restaurant, owned by the company, for realty and business taxes.\nIn this action brought to restrain the assessment, four main questions arose :\n(1) Is the said agreement valid and binding?\nIf valid\u2014\n(2) Is the exemption operative only within the limits of the city as these existed at the time the agreement was made or as those limits may have been from time to time constituted?\n(3) Is the exemption applicable to the hotel and restaurant?\n(4) Does the exemption include business tax?\nAll questions were decided by the trial judge in favour of the company. On appeal, his decision on question one was affirmed, but reversed on the others.\nHeld: The appeal of the C.P.R. should be allowed, the appeal of the City of Winnipeg dismissed, and the trial judgment restored. Rand and Kellock JJ. would have varied the judgment so as to exclude the hotel and restaurant from the exemption.\nPer: Rinfret C.J., Kerwin, Taschereau, Locke and Fauteux JJ.\u2014It was unnecessary to determine whether the company was a common law corporation; by virtue of 1881 (Can.) c. 1 and s. 4 of the Letters Patent, the company had the power to enter into the agreement. Per: Rand and Kellock JJ.\u2014The powers of the company were not those of a common law corporation. Assuming that the company could not bind itself to maintain the works in the city forever, but considering that (1) the company might in fact maintain them indefinitely, (2) the city, having up to the present time received the entire current consideration for which it had bargained, (3) recission having been virtually impossible from the completion of the works, and (4) for any failure in the future, security by way of recoupment from future tax exemptions will be available, the city should be restrained from repealing the by-law, upon the company undertaking, in the event of any future removal of the works, to recoup the city for such damages, not to exceed the amount of the benefits enjoyed under the tax exemption hereafter, as might be found to be suffered by the city by reason of the removal.\nPer: Estey and Cartwright JJ.\u2014The power to execute the contract here in question was, in any event, necessarily incidental to the express powers.\nAPPEAL by the city of Winnipeg, and a further appeal by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba 1 allowing in part an appeal by the city from a judgment of Williams C.J.K.B. 2 in favour of the C.P.R. in an action to enjoin the city of Winnipeg from imposing certain taxation.\nC. F. H. Carson, K.C., H. A. V. Green, K.C. and Allan Findlay for the Appellant. As to whether the exemption is applicable to the part added to the City The City's contention is that the phrase \"the City of Winnipeg\", even though used without qualification, should be construed as meaning the City of Winnipeg as it existed at the time By-law 148 was passed. In the absence of such a qualification and of clear evidence to be derived from the facts and circumstances existing at the time or from subsequent conduct of the parties that such a qualification was intended, the phrase should be given its natural meaning, that is, the City as from time to time constituted. The facts and circumstances existing at the time of the By-law and the subsequent conduct of the parties indicate that it was not intended to give the phrase a restricted meaning but that it should have its natural meaning. Charrington & Co. Ltd. v. Wooder 3; River Wear Commsrs. v. Adamson 4. By-law 148 was submitted to and approved by the ratepayers of the city as then constituted on August 24, 1881, and less than a year later, on May 30, 1882, a considerable area was added to the city by c. 36 (Man.). On Sept. 20, 1882, By-law 195, the sole purpose of which was to amend By-law 148, was referred to the ratepayers of the city as extended. Had it been intended that the \"City of Winnipeg\" in By-law 148 was to have the restricted meaning, it might fairly be expected that this would have been indicated in the amending By-law. It was not. Similarly when the City became subject to the general Municipal Act of the Province, 1886, (Man.) c. 52, if the exemption was to be limited to the City as it existed prior to the 1882 extension, it might be expected that the City would have required some qualification to be inserted in the Act to make that clear.\nAccording to the majority of the Court of Appeal the provision in clause 4(9) of By-law 148 that \"this by-law shall take effect from and after\" Sept. 21, 1881, indicated that the exemption was to be limited to the area of the City as it existed on the date the by-law came into effect. No such interpretation can be fairly put or any such inference drawn. There are at least two reasons why the by-law contained an express provision as when it was to take effect. 1st\u2014the by-law recited that the debentures to be given by the City were to be payable in \"twenty years from the date this by-law is to take effect\"; 2nd\u2014 S. 931 of the City's charter 1875 (Man.) c. 50, provided that any by-law for contracting debts by borrowing money would only be valid if the by-law \"shall name a day in the financial year in which the same is passed, when the bylaw shall take effect\". The subsequent conduct of the parties and the practices they followed under the agreement constitute a useful guide in determining the construction to be placed on the phrases in the agreement which are ambiguous. Ottawa v. C.N.R. 5. If the exemption clause had not been operative in the added area prior to the time when The Railway Taxation Act, 1900 (Man.) c. 57, came into force the City would have had the power and the duty to tax the property of the Company in that area. Realizing the exemption applied to it the City did not, except for an unsuccessful attempt to levy school taxes, attempt to tax the Company's property-situated either within the City's limits as constituted in 1881 or as subsequently enlarged. The fact that the property of the Company in the area added by the City after 1881 was not taxed from 1882 to 1900 and like other property of the Company was shown on the assessment rolls with the notation \"exempt by By-law 148\", is cogent evidence of the City's own interpretation of the phrase \"within the limits of the City of Winnipeg\".\nPursuant to the bond and covenant given by the Company it duly built its principal workshops for Manitoba in the City of Winnipeg as it existed at the date of By-law 148 whereby it was bound to \"forever continue the same within the said City of Winnipeg.\" In 1903 it moved the workshops to a location in the area added to the City in 1882 and has continued them there ever since. No complaint was made by the City. This indicates that neither the Company nor the City regarded the phrase \"within the limits of the City of Winnipeg\" as used in clause 4(3) to have the restricted meaning now contended for. If it was not used in the restricted sense in clause 4(3) of By-law 148, it can hardly be suggested that the same phrase was used in a restricted sense in the exemption clause 4(8). In City of Winnipeg v. C.P.R. 6, the City did not contend that the exemption was inapplicable to the part of the City added after 1881, and therefore, that at the very least the property of the Company in that part of the City was liable for school taxes. This again indicates that the City regarded the agreement as meaning that the exemption applied to the added areas. Assistance may be furnished by other cases in which the court had to deal with a similar problem. In City of Calgary v. Canadian Western Natural Gas Co. 7, it was held that \"the city\" referred to in a franchise agreement was not restricted to the limits of the City as it existed when the franchise was granted. Other cases are: Toronto By Co. v. Toronto 8; Union Natural Gas Co. v. Chatham Gas Co. 9; United Gas & Fuel Co. of Hamilton v. Dominion Natural Gas Co. 10. The question of whether the exemption is restricted in application to the City as it existed in 1881 is now res judicata by virtue of the School Tax case 11. The decision of the Court that the \"property of the Company is exempt from any liability to contribute toward the support of the city schools\", must be taken to have decided that the property of the Company in the area added to the City in 1882 was subject to exemption. Hoystead v. Commissioner of Taxation 12.\nAs to whether the exemption is applicable to the hotel and restaurant of the Company. The exemption as set out in clause 148 of By-law applies to \"all property now owned or that hereafter may be owned\" by the Company \"\u2026 for railway purposes or in connection therewith\". The question raised in the Empress Hotel case 13 was quite different. What was decided there was that that hotel within the meaning of s. 92(10) (a) of the B.N.A. Act and of ss. 2 (21) and 6(c) of The Railway Act 1919 (Can.) c. 68 was not part of the Company's \"railway\" as the expression \"railway\" was used in those sections. In the present case the question is whether the hotel is owned by the Company \"for railway purposes or in connection therewith\". In other words is the hotel owned by the Company for the purposes of the railway or in connection with the purposes of the railway. Even if the question had been the same in both cases, what the Privy Council decided as to the Empress Hotel could not bind this Court in considering the position of the Royal Alexandra Hotel. The decision of the Privy Council must be considered in the light of the facts of the case. The position here is different. The evidence as to the nature and functions of the hotel establishes clearly that it is owned \"for railway purposes and in connection therewith.\"\nThe agreement dated August 4, 1906, whereby the Company agreed to make certain payments to the City, expressly recites that \"the Company has built and constructed in the City of Winnipeg (in connection with its railway and the operation thereof) an hotel building \u2026\" Thus while the City had claimed that the hotel \"was not originally included within the meaning of a railway or railway enterprise\" it recognized by the terms of the recital that the hotel was constructed \"in connection with\" the railway and its operation, a recognition that the hotel was owned \"for railway purposes or in connection therewith\" within the meaning of the exemption in By-law 148. The Railway Taxation Act up to 1909 exempted \"the property of every nature and kind\" of the Company, with certain exceptions not relevant, and there could be no doubt the exemption included the hotel. By the 1909 amending Act an additional exception was made namely \"all lands and property held by the Company not in actual use in the operation of the railway.\" In 1914 and 1942 the Company was called on and agreed to make larger payments to the City, on neither occasion did the City base its claim for payment on the ground that the hotel and restaurant were not \"in actual use in the operation of the railway\" and that because of the change in the Act the conditions which existed when the agreement of 1906 was entered into no longer existed. Not only on the evidence of fact but also on the interpretation placed on the terms of the exemption by the parties to the agreement the hotel and restaurant constitute property owned for railway purposes and in connection with railway purposes and are thus within the exemption. As to whether the business tax is within the exemption. The majority of the Court of Appeal were of the opinion that under the terms of the City's charter the assessment for business tax was not an assessment of property and the tax itself was a tax on the person and not on property, and therefore that the exemption did not apply. Their decision was reached before judgment was delivered in C.P.R. v. A.G. for Saswatchewan 14. It is submitted that for the reasons given in the majority judgment in that case the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal in the present case on the question of business tax should be reversed.\nWhether the agreement between the City and the Company set forth in By-law 148 as amended by By-law 195 is valid and binding is raised by the appeal of the City from the judgment of the Court of Appeal. So far as this question is concerned the City is the appellant and the Company the respondent. It is clear that all necessary steps were taken to render By-law 148 and amending By-law 195 valid and binding upon the City. If there was any doubt as to the powers of the City when the agreement was made to enter into the agreement and to enact the two by-laws, such doubt was removed by the Legislature of Manitoba. By statute, 1883 (Man.) c. 64, s. 6, the two by-laws were declared to be \"legal, binding and valid upon the said Mayor and Council of the City of Winnipeg\". The Supreme Court of Canada in School Tax Case 15 held that \"the whole and every part of the by-law was in express words confirmed\" by the validating act. The question has therefore been concluded against the City.\nAnother question arising out of the City's appeal is whether the Company had power to enter into the agreement. It is submited (i) That the Company had the status of a common law company and as such had power to enter into the agreement. (ii) It also had such power by virtue of its expressly enumerated powers. The following cases are submited in support of the first proposition. Baroness Wenlock v. River Dee Co. 16; Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Co. v. The King 17. As to the second submission, the Company had the power to enter into and perform the agreemnt by virtue of the expressly enumerated powers granted it by the charter. Even if it were held to have the status of a statutory company with powers restricted to those expressly enumerated, it is submitted that the Company had power to enter into and perform the obligations contained in the Contract. Vide para. 4 of the Charter; clause 7 and 8 of the Contract.\nThe agreement with the City was intra vires the Company as being expressly authorized by its charter or as being reasonably incidental to the business expressly authorized by its charter. A. G. v. Mersey Ry. 18; A. G. v. Great Eastern Ry. Co. 19; Deuchar v. Gas Light & Coke Co. 20. As to Whitby v. G.T.R. Co. 21, the facts and the conditions imposed differ and the case is to be distinguished.\nW. P. Fillmore, K.C., F. J. Sutton, K.C., and G. F. D. Bond, K.C., for the respondent. While the Company delivered to the City a form of bond and covenant in pur- ported compliance with the conditions and stipulations set out in By-law 148, s. 4 (3) and (4) such bond and covenant was of no force or effect as the Company had no power either expressly or by implication to give it. The fact that it was soon found necessary to remove the workshops outside the original limits of the City shows that the original site was not suitable and that the covenant to forever continue them within the City as then constituted was incompatible with the efficient operation and management of the railway. The directors of the railway had no power to enter into an agreement so onerous on the Company and binding on it for all time. It amounted to a covenant not to exercise its statutory powers. It was in conflict with the Company's contractual obligations to the government to forever efficiently maintain and operate the C.P.R. To ascertain the statutory powers of the Company it is necessary to turn to the Consolidated Railway Act, 1879 (Can.) c. 9, to which the charter is subject. The following sections appear material, ss. 2(2), 5 (1),(16), 6, and 7(1), (2), (8), (10) and (19). Nowhere in 1881 (Can.) c. 1, the incorporating Act or charter of the Company, nor in the Consolidated Ry. Act, 1879, is there any express power conferred on the Company to enter into a perpetual covenant to forever maintain their principal workshops for the main line at any designated location. On the contrary, there are clear implications that the Company had no such right or authority. The Company has not been able to point to any express power but it is argued that the Company has all the powers of a common law company on account of the charter having been dealt with under the Great Seal. As to the powers of the Company to enter into a perpetual covenant relating to the operation of the railway, the City relies upon Whitby v. G.T.R. 22; Montreal Park & Island Ry. Co. v. Chateauguay & Northern Ry. Co. 23; Town of Eastview v. R. C. Episcopal Corporation of Ottawa 24. The Company had no express or implied power to fetter or part with its statutory powers by entering into the covenant which was a condition precedent to tax exemption. Further any implications to be found in the charter and relevant statutes are to the contrary. The agreement must be construed as if the controversy had arisen the day after the agreement was executed. You cannot test the question of ultra vires by waiting to see whether the corporation which acted beyond its express powers made a good bargain. Re North Eastern Ry. v. Hastings 25; Charrington v. Wooder 26. The agreement must be evaluated in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it was entered into. Bank of N.Z. v. Simpson 27; River Weir Commsrs. v. Adamson 28.\nThe City contends that the incorporating Act, the contract thereby approved and the schedule annexed together with the Consolidated Ry. Act, 1879, exhibit all the powers Parliament granted or authorized to be granted the Company and the doctrine of ultra vires applies. It submits in particular that (a) The incorporating Act was a special Act. (b) The recitals in the incorporating Act and in the charter show that the Governor in Council carried out the directions of Parliament, acted as its delegate in issuing the prescribed charter and did not purport to exercise and did not exercise the royal prerogative in that behalf. (c) The Governor in Council could not by royal prerogative create a railway company with all the powers, privileges and property rights granted the Company and the charter would have been invalid without the Act of Parliament. (d) Any intention to create a common law corporation is excluded by necessary implication.\nThe incorporating Act was not only a special Act but a special Act for a special purpose and the Company derives its legal existence wholly from the incorporating statute and the charter thereby prescribed and authorized. 1881 (Can.) ss. 21, 22, The Railway Act, 1879, s. 5 (1) and (16). Corresponding sections of The Railway Act, 1919, were discussed in C.P.R. v. A.G. of B.C. 29. It was there held that it was only by virtue of this Act that the Company had power to acquire hotels, etc., and it was the opinion of the Court or some members thereof that the C.P.R. Act of 1902 was a special Act. (Estey J. at 386, 87). This opinion is in line with Elve v. Boyton 30. In the Bonanza Creek case 31 Lord Haldane at 584: \"In the case of a company the legal existence of which is wholly derived from the words of a statute the company does not possess the general capacity of a natural person and the doctrine of ultra vires applies\".\nThe recitals in the incorporating Act and in the charter show that the Governor-in-Council carried out the directions of Parliament and acted as its delegate in issuing a charter to the Company and did not purport to exercise and did not exercise the Royal Prerogative in that behalf. Vide s. 2 of the Act and the recital in the charter. Cobalt v. Temiskaming Telephone Co. 32. As the exact form of charter was prescribed by statute and agreed upon by the approved contract it is clear that the authority conferred upon the Governor General was merely to bring into existence the entity to be known as the Canadian Pacific Railway. The Governor General could not and did not purport to over-ride the Act of Parliament or the approved agreement by conferring additional powers on the railway company. The Governor-in-Council could not by Royal Prerogative create a railway company such as the C.P.R. and the charter would have been invalid if not authorized by an Act of Parliament. The Canada Joint Stock Companies Act, 1877 (Can.), c. 43, s. 3. C.P.R. v, Notre Dame de Bonsecours Parish 33.\nAny intention to create a common law corporation is excluded by necessary implication. The Company derived its entire existence from the act and will of Parliament and did not require and did not receive any grant from the Crown either directly or through the Governor General as its delegate. It was brought into existence by direct legislative action. Cobalt v. Temiskaming Telephone Co. supra at 74, 75. A.G. v. De Keyer's Royal Hotel 34, B.C. Coal Corp. v. The King 35, Canadian Bank of Commerce v. Cudworth Telephone Co. 36, where the Bonanza Creek case was distinguished. In Re Northwestern Trust Co. and the Winding-up Act 37, the Cudworth case was followed and the Bonanza Creek case distinguished. Toronto Finance Corp. v. Banking Corp. 38 is also relied on.\nThe powers of the C.P.R. and the C.P.R. Act of 1902 are discussed at length in C.P.R. v. A.G. for B.C. 39 but the contention that the C.P.R. possessed all the powers of a common law corporation was apparently not made in the argument or referred to in any of the judgments. On this point the City refers to and relies on the judgment of Dysart J.A. in the court below, concurred in by Richards J.A. The majority of the judges in the court below failed to appreciate that the Company was not incorporated under a Joint Stock Companies Act but was a company incorporated for a special purpose and pursuant to a contract between the government and the promoters. They failed to appreciate that the Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Co. was incorporated by letters patent under the Ontario Joint Stock Companies Act and in the opinion of Lord Haldane purported to derive its existence from the Act of the sovereign and not merely from the words of the regulating statute and therefore possesed a status resembling that of a corporation at common law.\nIn the event of the Court holding that it was beyond the power of the Company to give the bond and covenant mentioned in By-law 148 as amended by By-law 195, the question arises whether the City is estopped from setting this up by reason of the judgment in C.P.R. v. Winnipeg 40. The power of the Company to give the bond and covenant was not discussed or even mentioned in the pleadings or judgment or reasons for judgment in the Supreme Court or in the Court below, and it is submitted that no issue was raised in the pleadings upon which this question could have been determined. It is submitted there can be no estoppel by res judicata unless everything in controversy in the proceedings where the question of estoppel is raised was also in controversy in the litigation which resulted in the judicial decision relied upon as an estoppel. Outram v. Morewood 41; Notes to the Duchess of Kingston's case 42 Spencer Bower's Res Judicata at p. 121 citing Moss v. Anglo Egyptian Navigation Co. 43; 13 Hals. pp. 411-12, s. 466 (2nd ed.) Langmead v. Maple 44; Johanesson v. C.P.R. 45; Howlett v. Tarte 46. All that the court decided in the first action between the City and the Company was that by-law No. 148 as amended by by-law 195 was a valid by-law and that school taxes were included in the phrase \"municipal taxes, rates and levies and assessments of every nature and kind.\" The question of whether it was ultra vires the company to give the bond and covenant was not fundamental to the decision in the first action, and it is not res judicata in the present action.\nIf the agreement set forth in By-law 148 was ultra vires the Company it cannot become intra vires by reason of estoppel, lapse of time, ratification, acquiesence or delay. York Corp. v. Henry Leetham & Sons Ltd. 47; Toronto Electric Light Co. v. City of Toronto 48. It is also submitted for the reasons mentioned in para. 341 of the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge, the agreements between the City and the Company relating to the Royal Alexandra Hotel in 1906, 1914 and 1942, do not operate as an estoppel as contended by the plaintiff.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice, Kerwin, Taschereau and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:\nKerwin J.:\u2014The Canadian Pacific Railway Company appeals and the city of Winnipeg cross-appeals against a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba. The dispute between the parties hinges upon clause 8 of by-law 148 of the city, passed September 5, 1881, which clause reads as follows:\n8. Upon the fulfilment by the said Company of the conditions and stipulations herein-mentioned, by the said Canadian Pacific Railway Company all property now owned, or that hereafter may be owned by them within the limits of the City of Winnipeg, for Railway purposes, or in connection therewith shall be forever free and exempt from all municipal taxes, rates and levies, and assessments of every nature and kind.\nThe conditions and stipulations referred to are contained in preceding clauses of the by-law by which the company undertook to build, construct and complete, on certain property in the city, a substantial and commodious general passenger railway depot, and particularly clause 3, reading as follows:\n3. The said Canadian Pacific Railway Company, shall immediately after the ratification of this by-law as aforesaid, make, execute and deliver to the mayor and Council of the City of Winnipeg a Bond and Covenant under their Corporate Seal, that the said company shall with all convenient and reasonable dispatch establish and build within the limits of the City of Winnipeg, their principal workshops for the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway within the Province of Manitoba, and the branches thereof radiating from Winnipeg, within the limits of the said province, and for ever continue the same within the said City of Winnipeg.\nThis by-law and an amending by-law No. 195 passed September 20, 1882, were ratified and confirmed by an Act of the Manitoba Legislature. It is admitted that the company fulfilled its obligations and with the exception of an abortive attempt by the city to impose school taxes, Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. City of Winnipeg 49, no question arose between the parties as to the company's liability to taxation until, in the year 1948, the city attempted to assess and levy realty and business taxes, when this action was brought for a declaration that the company was not so liable.\nThe company succeeded at the trial but the judgment in its favour was set aside by the Court of Appeal by a majority, although there a majority were in agreement with the conclusions of the trial judge upon the first question involved, viz., the capacity of the company to enter into the agreement evidenced by by-laws 148 and 195. The trial judge considered that the company had the status of a common law corporation with powers analogous to those of a natural person and in that view the Chief Justice of Manitoba and Coyne J.A. and Adamson J.A. agreed. The latter also held, as had the trial judge, that in any event the expressly enumerated powers of the company gave it authority to make the agreement, and on this additional ground held the agreement intra vires. Richards J.A. and Dysart J.A. held that the company's powers were limited to those set forth in a special Act authorizing its charter but the former held that the agreement was within such powers and intra vires the company so that the latter was the only member of the court dissenting on the question as to the company's power to enter into the agreement. On this first point I find it unnecessary to determine whether the city was incorporated by Royal Charter and hence had all the powers of a natural person, and therefore it is inadvisable to say anything upon the subject. The enumerated powers of the company, which appear in the reasons for judgment of several of the members of this court, and in the reasons for judgment in the courts below are sufficient in my view to authorize the company to do as it agreed, and as was subsequently carried out. Decisions like Whitby v. Grand Trunk Railway Co. 50 relied upon by the city, depend upon the terms of the enactments conferring the particular powers there in question. I might add that I have found it unnecessary in the consideration of this point, or any of the others, to deal with the company's argument that because of the decision in C.P.R. v. City of Winnipeg (supra), several of the matters now raised by the city are res judicata.\nThe second question is whether the exception is confined to property within the limits of the city existing at the date of by-law 148. Upon a review of all the terms of the by-law, and in view of the circumstances that existed at the time of its enactment, I have come to the conclusion that this question should be answered in the negative. If there be any ambiguity in the construction of those terms, which I do not think there is, the company's contention would be advanced by the fact that by the time by-law 195 was passed the company had executed part of its obligation on land that had been taken into the city subsequent to the enactment of by-law 148.\nThe third question, whether business taxes are included in the exemption is settled by the decision of this court in C.P.R. v. Attorney General of Saskatchewan 51.\nThe fourth question, whether the exemption is applicable to the company's Royal Alexandra Hotel and the restaurant in the railway station should be answered in the affirmative. Whatever bearing the company's enumerated powers under its charter might have upon the point as to the power of the company to build hotels need not be considered in view of the Act of 1902. Undoubtedly since then the company has such power and the Royal Alexandra Hotel and the restaurant fall in my opinion within the words of the exemption: \"all property owned or that hereafter may be owned \u2026 for railway purposes, or in connection therewith.\" The hotel property or restaurant need not be owned exclusively either for railway purposes or in connection with railway purposes. Other cases decided upon other provisions are not helpful but in connection with the point as to the limits of the city, as well as the point now under discussion, the arrangement set forth in by-law 148 as amended should be construed as is said by Lord Sumner in City of Halifax v. Nova Scotia Car Works, Limited 52, as \"one of bargain and of mutual advantage.\" The decision of the judicial committee in Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Attorney General for British Columbia 53, depended upon the construction of the British North America Act, 1867.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed, both with costs, the judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside and that of the trial judge restored. The appellant should have its costs in the Court of Appeal.\nRand J.:\u2014Of the several points raised, I shall deal with only one: the authority of the company to bind itself forever to maintain the principal workshops for the province in the city and the legal situation resulting from its absence.\nOn the first branch of the argument, that is, whether the company, from its incorporation by letters patent under the Great Seal of Canada, possesses all the powers of a common law corporation, the controlling consideration, as decided by the judicial committee in the Bonanza Creek Co. case 54, is the source from which the incorporating efficacy is drawn, whether from the statute or from the prerogative. On this, I should say that that source cannot be the prerogative alone for the reason that the authority to construct a railway, as given to the company, could not arise from it. The incorporation not only creates the capacities of the company but clothes it with essential powers and some of these latter impinge on common law rights and liberties for which legislation is essential. Nor can I infer from the statute an intention to authorize faculties proceeding from both sources: the incorporation was of an entirety of objects, capacities and powers; and although special powers can by legislation be conferred on a common law corporation, I know of no authority under the prerogative to add capacities to a statutory corporation.\nThen it is argued that the scope of the statutory endowment was sufficient for the covenant given. Viewing the question from the standpoint of the interest of the company as a private enterprise, it is difficult to see the creation of any obligation that violates the original compact of the shareholders inter se; but the principle of ultra vires, in addition to the general public interest in the authorization of corporate action, has public aspects of special significance in enterprises of the nature of that before us. Here was an undertaking conceived primarily for a high national purpose; it was designed as a bond to complete the scheme and organization of a Dominion extending from ocean to ocean by furnishing the essential means for the settlement and the utilization of the resources of its western half; and the company was made the beneficiary of substantial assistance from the public in money, lands and privileges. That object indeed exemplifies the importance of the initial construction; once permanent works were established, they would tend to draw to themselves an adjustment of other services and arrangements and the system of operations would become a settled accommodation which, in ordinary circumstances, would deepen its rigidity with the years. All this, in turn, would have its reflex in shaping the course and development of the social and business life of the community which it was to serve. But unusual circumstances, as at times eventuated in the early days of railway projects, might necessitate changes in transportation plans and arrangements and we might have such a situation as was presented to the courts of Ontario in Whitby v. Grand Trunk Railway Co. 55.\nI do not find it necessary, however, to decide the question. I will assume that the company could not bind itself to continue forever the workshops, and the question is, what follows from that. The entire transaction must be kept in view, and for that purpose it is desirable to summarize the details. By-law No. 148 (later embodied in by-law No. 195) was passed by the city on September 5, 1881 and its provisions were to take effect from September 21, 1881. Along with others it was confirmed by c. 64, Statutes of Manitoba, 1883, and by c. 52 of the Statutes of 1886. It was to become effective as a contractual obligation of the city on the performance by the company, to which it is to be observed the company did not bind itself, of certain conditions. These were the construction of the Pembina branch line to the southwest on or before February 1, 1883; the construction of a passenger depot in the city within the same time; and the giving of a covenant forthwith after the passing of the by-law to build within the city and with all reasonable despatch and forever to continue the principal workshops of the railway within Manitoba, and as soon as convenient to erect suitable stockyards. Upon the fulfillment of those three conditions, bonds of the city in the sum of $200,000 were to be delivered to the company and all property of the company within the city was thereafter and forever to be free and exempt from municipal taxation.\nA deed of the land on which the station was to be built was to be delivered to the company upon the delivery of the covenant. On April 18, 1882 that deed was executed and it recites in the preamble that \"the said bond (covenant) has been by the said company made, executed and delivered as required in the said by-law mentioned\". Upon the further completion of the branch line and the depot within the time stated, the bonds were delivered under the authority of by-law No. 219 passed on March 30, 1883. In its preamble it is recited:\nAND WHEREAS the Canadian Pacific Railway Company mentioned in said by-law No. 195 have completed and performed all the conditions mentioned in the said by-law and in all other respects complied with the same: and it is desirable that the said trustee should be instructed to deliver the bonds mentioned therein, with the coupons still unmatured, to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company or their proper officer on that behalf.\nLater, pursuant to the covenant, the workshops and the stockyards were constructed and the former have at all times since then been maintained. As from the same time, that is, the time for the delivery of the bonds, the exemption from taxation has been respected until 1948. The language of by-law No. 148 dealing with the furnishing of the covenant should be noticed:\n(3) The said Canadian Pacific Railway Company shall immediately after the ratification of this by-law as aforesaid, make, execute, and deliver to the mayor and council of the City of Winnipeg a bond and covenant under their corporate seal * * *\nThe company was clearly within its powers in building the branch line, depot, workshops and stockyards as it did; it would be absurd to say that the city could object to any part of that performance on the ground that the obligation to make it was invalid: and the remaining obligation to continue the workshops is clearly severable from that for their construction. But on the assumption I am now making the instrument cannot be said to furnish the entire consideration to which the city was entitled and there is, to that extent, a partial failure of a promissory character, although the performance has to this moment been completely and validly maintained.\nThe question of law then is this: whether a partial and severable failure of promissory consideration, followed by an entirety of irrevocable execution of the remaining consideration to the benefit of the other party, can be the ground on which a continuing and substantial obligation on the part of the latter can be repudiated. Rescission is obviously impossible as it has been from the moment the first work was completed. As early as 1888 the city could have taken the ground it now takes: and it is only the accident of the present search for grounds of escaping taxation exemptions that discloses the flaw today.\nThe significance of the contract to the city lay in the location of the railway and its centres of administration. The city was at the beginning of its life: it was seeking to establish itself as a focal point in the massive development of the West which was then in prospect. At that stage the action of the railway was of controlling importance. Transportation was the paramount agency in creating and promoting business and population groupings and probably no single factor has contributed so largely to the growth and wealth of what is now a great metropolis than the measures dealt with in the contract before us. The railway system is now too deeply integrated with the settled life of the province and the entire West to permit of any major readjustment: the city has attained a dominant position on the prairies, and the removal of the workshops could have no more than a minor effect on its economic life or interest. In other words, the city having absorbed irrevocably the substance of the benefit under the contract seizes upon this item which may never manifest itself in default, and which even in actual breach would create little more than a ripple on the surface of its economy, to justify repudiation notwithstanding that the courts, as I shall endeavour to show, could deal effectively with such a default should it ever arise.\nBoth parties assumed the capacity of the company to make the covenant and acted under a common mistake of law; as executed it was in the precise form stipulated by the by-law; and it was accepted as a fulfilment of one of the conditions upon which the exemption from taxation became effective. On the strength of that acceptance, the construction of the workshops and stockyards was carried out. In these circumstances, the city is now estopped from taking the position that the exemption clause in the by-law never became effective; the coming into force of that provision is in the same category as to effectiveness as was the delivery of the bonds to the company: it is the same as if a new by-law had then been passed. The exemption provision became therefore and remains in effect, and in the absence of its repeal, there is today no authority in the city to tax the company's property.\nThe principle of enforcement in equity of contractual obligations with compensation is long established, and its employment here is dictated by the reasons on which it is based. Its general application has been confined to contracts for the sale of land. But the sale of land was part of the consideration here; the remainder was and is an indirect interest in and a beneficial consequence resulting from the operation of works on land. The controversy is broadly, then, within the scope of matters in which the principle has in the past been employed: there is not merely a close analogy, the actual items of land and interest constitute the basic subject-matter.\nThe circumstance that differentiates the situation here from the generality of ultra vires contracts is the characteristic of time attached to the physical acts of performance. Those acts by both parties are intra vires: the exemption was confirmed by the legislature; the workshops may, in the discretion of the company, be continued within the city limits forever, indeed the existing circumstances may in fact compel that performance, and the city would then receive from the company the whole of what, by the contract, it sought. It is only the substitution of obligation for discretion in that continuance that raises the difficulty.\nThe company could, at the outset, have validly accepted and can today accept the future tax exemption on the condition that if at any time the workshops should be removed, the amount of the taxes so saved would be recouped to the city to the extent of damages it might suffer from the removal: it would be the return of a benefit conditioned on a failure to maintain a work within the power of the company to create, maintain, or abandon. Such an arrangement would, I think, be clearly within the company's powers expressly or impliedly conferred by the incorporating statute as well as the Railway Act.\nThat is closely analogous to one case of specific performance with compensation. When a vendor seeks to enforce an agreement, compensation is a voluntary condition of relief; the vendor enters Court offering to give up a portion of the price of what he promised to and cannot fully convey. This may, roughly, be equivalent to damages, but it is not in law of that character.\nSuch a mode of adjustment may here be said to substitute a conditional for a promissory term in the contract: instead of mutual promises to maintain and exempt, the obligations would be, to exempt so long as the workshops are maintained and to recoup should that cease. It is modifying the legal situation no doubt, but that would not be novel in equitable administration: all equitable relief modifies the legal situation; and since, at law, the parties would now be left as they are, that neither of the outstanding obligations would be enforced, it is just such a result that the principle of relief against unjust enrichment is in every case called in to redress.\nIn this exceptional conjunction of circumstances, to carry a rule of ultra vires to an ultimate logic would, in the presence of the institution of equity, be its reduction to absurdity. At such a point, logic must yield to common sense as well as to justice. The city, by reason of these matters, has drawn upon itself an equity of obligation; it would be inequitable and unjust while it is enjoying to the full the actual benefits for which it bargained to refuse to pay the price for them. There is no question of enforcing an ultra vires promise against the company nor of exacting performance by the city as the consideration of an ultra vires promise. The position of the city before any step was taken to withdraw the exemption, a position of full current but unenforceable performance on both sides, can in substance, from now on, be preserved by the application of established principles; and as equity looks at the substance and not the form of what is presented to it, to maintain that position would accord with the basic reason for equitable interposition at any time.\nAs the company asserts the covenant to be good, it is as if it were proffering an undertaking, in the event of the removal of the workshops from the city, to recoup to the city out of the benefit received through the future tax exemption, such amount of compensation as the Court might determine to be the loss the city might thereby sustain; on that basis, the declaration and injunction asked for should go.\nIn all other respects, I concur in the views reached by my brother Kellock whose reasons I have had the privilege of reading.\nKellock J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba in an action brought by the appellant for a declaration that certain property owned by it in the respondent municipality is entitled to exemption from municipal assessment under by-law No. 148 as amended by by-law No. 195 of the city, both having been validated by provincial legislation. The appellant succeeded at the trial, but, while the agreement evidenced by the by-laws was upheld on appeal, it was construed so as to deprive the appellant of the essential relief claimed. Four questions are involved:\n(1) the capacity of the appellant to enter into the agreement evidenced by the by-laws;\n(2) whether the exemption is confined to property within the limits of the city existing at the effective date of the by-law;\n(3) whether business taxes are included in the exemption; and\n(4) whether the exemption is applicable to the appellant's Royal Alexandra Hotel. As to the first question, it was held by the Chief Justice, Coyne and Adamson JJ.A., in agreement with the learned trial judge, that the appellant has all the powers of a common law corporation and accordingly had capacity to enter into the agreement in question. Dysart and Richards JJ.A. were, however, of opinion that the appellant had only statutory powers. The former considered that the agreement was not within those powers. The latter was of a contrary opinion.\nWith respect to the other questions, the opinion of Richards, Dysart and Adamson JJ.A. was in favour of the respondent. The Chief Justice and Coyne J.A. dissented.\nBy-law No. 148, passed September 5, 1881, recites that it is desirable that a line of railway southwesterly from the city should be built for the purpose of developing and advancing the traffic and trade between the city and the southern and southwestern portions of Manitoba; that it is also desirable to secure the location of the workshops and stockyards of the company for the province of Manitoba at the city of Winnipeg, as a central point on the main line of the railway and the several branches thereof, and that it is expedient for the city, in consideration of the agreement of the company to do these things, to lend their aid to the company by granting to the company debentures of the city to the amount of $200,000, and by exempting property of the company\nnow owned or hereafter to be owned by the said Railway Company for Railway purposes within the City of Winnipeg from taxation forever.\nA suitable site for a station was also to be conveyed by the city to the company.\nThe by-law authorizes the issue and delivery of the debentures upon fulfilment by the railway company of certain conditions, namely,\n1. Construction of the railway mentioned in the recital by February 1, 1883;\n2. Construction by the same date of a station on the lands to be conveyed to the company by the city;\n3. Delivery by the company, upon ratification of the by-law by the ratepayers, of a formal covenant that the company would, with all convenient and reasonable dispatch, establish and build \"within the limits of the city of Winnipeg\" their principal workshops for \"the main line within the province of Manitoba, and the branches radiating from the city,\" and \"forever continue the same within the said city of Winnipeg\"; 4. The covenant should extend also to the erection within the \"city of Winnipeg\" of stock or cattle yards suitable for the central business of the main line and the said branches.\nThe covenant does not of itself stipulate the continued maintenance of the stockyards within the city, but the recital states that the company had so agreed.\nWith respect to the question of capacity, I agree with the conclusion of Richards and Dysart JJ.A. that the appellant has not the powers of a common law corporation. Appellant was incorporated by letters patent under the Great Seal issued pursuant to s. 2 of the statute of Canada, 44 Vict. c. 1, assented to on February 15, 1881. The statute approved of a contract dated October 21, 1880, for the construction of \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" as described in the Act of 1874, 37 Vict. c. 14, in part by the company and in part by the government, the whole of which was to become the property of the company, which obligated itself forever thereafter to \"efficiently maintain, work and run\" the same. Paragraphs 21 and 22 of the contract read as follows:\n21. The company to be incorporated, with sufficient powers to enable them to carry out the foregoing contract, and this contract shall only be binding in the event of an Act of incorporation being granted to the company in the form hereto appended as Schedule A.\n22. The Railway Act of 1879, in so far as the provisions of the same are applicable to the undertaking referred to in this contract, and in so far as they are not inconsistent herewith or inconsistent with or contrary to the provisions of the Act of incorporation to be granted to the company, shall apply to the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nThe schedule referred to in para. 21 above provides by para. 1 that certain individuals,\nwith all such other persons and corporations as shall become shareholders in the company hereby incorporated, shall be and they are hereby constituted a body corporate and politic, by the name of the \"Canadian Pacific Railway\".\nPara. 4 reads as follows:\nAll the franchises and powers necessary or useful to the company to enable them to carry out, perform, enforce, use, and avail themselves of, every condition, stipulation, obligation, duty, right, remedy, privilege, and advantage agreed upon, contained or described in the said contract, are hereby conferred upon the company. And the enactment of the special provisions hereinafter contained shall not be held to impair or derogate from the generality of the franchises and powers so hereby conferred upon them. Para. 17 contains provisions similar to para. 22 of the contract, and by paragraphs 18 to 23 inclusive, certain sections of the Consolidated Railway Act are varied in their specific application to the company. The schedule, in subsequent sections, bestows further specific powers.\nWith respect to the enacting provisions of the statute itself, s. 2 reads as follows:\nFor the purpose of incorporating the persons mentioned in the said contract, and those who shall be associated with them in the undertaking, and of granting to them the powers necessary to enable them to carry out the said contract according to the terms thereof, the Governor may grant to them in conformity with the said contract, under the corporate name of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, a charter conferring upon them the franchises, privileges and powers embodied in the schedule to the said contract and to this Act appended, and such charter, being published in the Canada Gazette, with any order or Orders in Council relating to it, shall have force and effect as if it were an Act of the Parliament of Canada, and shall be held to be an Act of incorporation within the meaning of the said contract.\nThe appellant contends that in the change from the method of incorporation provided for by the contract, namely, by special Act in the form of the schedule appended to the contract, to the method provided for by s. 2 of the statute, namely, by letters patent under the Great Seal, Parliament had in mind the decision in Ashbury v. Riche 56, decided some six years earlier, and intended that the ambit of the powers of the appellant company should not be restricted in accordance with the principle which had been applied in that case, but should be those of a common law corporation. Appellant stresses that the letters patent recite that they are granted not only under the authority of the Special Act, but also under the authority of\n\"any other power and authority whatsoever in us vested in this behalf,\"\nand counsel refers to the judgment of the judicial committee in the Bonanza Creek case 57.\nAs stated by Viscount Haldane in the course of his judgment in that case, the question thus raised is simply one of interpretation of the language employed by Parliament. The words employed, to which the corporation owes its legal existence, must have their natural meaning, whatever that may be. Their Lordships, after tracing the prerogative power as to the incorporation of companies by the Governor General and the Lieutenant Governors respectively, considered the question whether there was, in the case before them, any legislation of such a character that the power to incorporate by charter from the Crown had been abrogated or interfered with to the extent that companies so created no longer possessed the capacity which would otherwise have been theirs. Reference is made to the Act of 1864, 27-28 Vict. c. 23, which authorized the Governor to grant charters for incorporation of companies for certain purposes named in the statute. S. 4 provided that every company so incorporated should be a body corporate \"capable forthwith of exercising all the functions of an incorporated company as if incorporated by a special act of Parliament.\"\nTheir Lordships construed this provision as enabling, and not as intended to restrict the existence of the company to what could be found in the words of the Act as distinguished from the letters patent granted in accordance with its provisions. They therefore held that the doctrine of Ashbury v. Riche does not apply where the company purports to derive its existence from the act of the Sovereign and not merely from the words of a regulating statute.\nIt is to be observed that the Act of 1864 and the Dominion and provincial Companies Acts in question in the Bonanza case were each enacted at a time when the prerogative power to incorporate was unaffected by other legislation. In the case at bar, however, when the Act of 1881 was passed, any power to incorporate a company for the construction and working of railways by virtue of the prerogative, had previously been expressely abrogated by s. 3 of the Joint Stock Companies Act of 1877, 40 Vict. c. 43, and prior thereto by s. 3 of the Act of 1869, 32-33 Vict. c. 13. Accordingly, the language in para. 1 of the letters patent, so much relied upon by counsel for the appellant company, namely, \"and of any other power and authority whatsoever in us vested in this behalf,\" is meaningless, there being in 1881 no power vested in the Governor General in Council with respect to the incorporation of a railway company, apart from that bestowed by the statute of 1881 itself. One must therefore find in that Act, or not at all, an intention to revive the prerogative for the purpose of the incorporation of the appellant company; Attorney General v. De Keyser's Royal Hotel 58, particularly at pp. 526 and 539-540.\nBefore considering the language of the statute, it is not irrelevant to observe that had it been the intention of Parliament to create the appellant company with the powers of a common law corporation, one would have expected, at that date at least, that something in the nature of express language would have been used. That the decision in Ashbury v. Riche had nothing to do with the form of s. 2 of the statute is, I think, indicated by the provisions of ss. 14 and 15 of the Canadian Pacific Railway Act of 1872, 35 Vict. c. 71, which make provision for incorporation by letters patent, in the circumstances there mentioned, of a corporation for the construction and operation of the railway later to be the subject of the contract with the appellant. In the case of these sections, it is not possible, in my opinion, to say that by the letters patent so authorized, a common law corporation would have emerged.\nMoreover, in my opinion, it is not possible to construe s. 2 of the statute of 1881 as enabling in relation to a coexistent power to incorporate, existing apart from the statute. Such a power did not then exist. Further, the authority given by s. 2 of the Act of 1881 for the purpose of incorporating the persons named in the contract, and of granting to them \"the powers necessary to enable them to carry out the said contract according to the terms thereof\", was to grant to them \"in conformity with the said contract\" a charter conferring upon them\n\"the franchises, privileges and powers embodied in the schedule to the said contract.\"\nPausing there, I find nothing in this language which operates to constitute such letters patent, letters issued by virtue of any royal prerogative or any authority apart from the statute itself, and in my opinion, the following language,\nand such charter, being published * * * shall have force and effect as if it were an Act of the Parliament of Canada, and shall be held to be an Act of incorporation within the meaning of the said contract,\nextends in no way the effect of the preceding language. The contract itself contemplates nothing more than a statute of incorporation with the powers mentioned in the schedule to the contract. The contractors themselves contracted with the government on that basis, and it surely cannot be supposed that it was in the minds of any of the contractors, or of the government, that the capital of the corporation to be created could be devoted to any purpose but the construction and continued operation of the railway therein described. It was an express term of the contract (para. 21) that the contractors were to be bound only in the event of an Act of incorporation being granted to the company \"in the form herein appended as Schedule A.\" That schedule contemplates no powers being granted to the company apart from those contained within the four corners of the schedule itself. Accordingly, in my opinion, it was intended, by the words last quoted above, to satisfy the terms of para. 21 of the contract and to do no more. I think it is impossible to read into the legislation some bestowal of power upon the company outside of that which was contracted for.\nIt would no doubt be speculation as to why incorporation by letters patent was adopted rather than by a special statute. It is to be observed, however, that the letters patent were issued the very day after assent was given to the statute, so that time seems to have been an important factor. It may have been thought that to have incorporated all the terms of the letters patent in 44 Vict. c. 1 itself would have been awkward from a drafting standpoint and that an additional statute would have consumed more time, and getting on with the business of the transcontinental railway was an urgent matter. However that may be, it would seem, if the appellant's contention on this point be correct, that under a statute approving of a contract, a very large departure from the contract was at the same time effected in a very unobtrusive way. In my opinion, however, upon the true construction of the language of the statute, no such intention can fairly be gathered.\nThe subsequent legislative history of the appellant company, for what it may be worth, is consistent with this interpretation. It may be said, and it was said on behalf of the appellant, that the subsequent legislation granting additional powers to the appellant company, was merely obtained ex abundanti cautela. Such a theory, however, is rather negatived by the preamble to the Act of 1890, 53 Vict. c. 47 to which no reference was made on the argument. That Act recites inter alia,\nand whereas several other railway companies are duly empowered to enter into agreements whereby the Canadian Pacific Railway Company may work, lease, or obtain running powers over their respective lines, and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, not having the requisite legislative authority for taking part in such an agreement, has prayed that the necessity for special legislation, giving such authority in each case in which it may find it expedient to do so, be avoided, and that Parliament give it the general authority hereinafter mentioned * * *\nIt might be said that this recital refers not to the creation of further capacity on the part of the appellant company, but to the granting of further rights, and such an answer might account sufficiently for s. 6 of the statute which authorized the appellants to enter into certain arrangements with Canadian companies. Such an explanation cannot account, however, for s. 7 which authorizes the appellant to make similar arrangements with companies outside Canada. Parliament can only create capacity to receive rights outside Canada. It cannot create the rights themselves. While the above recital may not be conclusive, and while it cannot control, if on a proper construction of the Act of 1881 the situation were otherwise, the position clearly appearing on the recital indicates that the conclusion to which I have come as to the proper construction of the incorporating Act is the one entertained by the appellant itself.\nReduced to its essence, the contract, for the performance of which the appellant was incorporated, was for the construction by the company of certain parts of the railway, and, upon the completion and conveyance to the company of the parts constructed by the government, for the permanent operation of the whole by the company. Apart from certain specific powers which are not relevant, the powers actually conferred upon the company by para. 4 of the letters patent were all the franchises and powers necessary or \"useful\" to the company to enable it to cary out, perform, enforce, use, and avail itself of every condition, stipulation, obligation, duty, right, remedy, privilege and advantage agreed upon, contained or described in the contract. It is the contention of the respondent that the covenant of the appellant with respect to the maintenance of the shops at Winnipeg amounts to a covenant not to exercise its statutory powers.\nIt is said for the respondent that the removal in fact of the appellant's shops from their original location to a point outside the 1881 boundaries of the city, and the establishment of additional stockyards outside those boundaries, shows that the covenant in question is incompatible with the efficient operation and management of the railway required by the contract with the Crown. It is said that other unforeseen events, such as excessive floods, might not only interfere with or prevent efficient operation, but might even yet render necessary the entire removal of the shops and yards from the city.\nThe respondent also points to para. 13 of the contract which reads,\nThe company shall have the right, subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, to lay out and locate the line of railway hereby contracted for, as they may gee fit, preserving the following terminal points, namely: from Callander station to the point of junction with the western section at Kamloops by way of Yellow Head Pass.\nand contends that a later event of the character already mentioned might have resulted in the establishment of the centre of population at Selkirk instead of at Winnipeg, and that the obligation to build and forever maintain the shops for the main line at Winnipeg, involving as it did an obligation (I quote from respondent's factum) \"by necessary implication to establish Winnipeg as a terminus of the railway in lieu of preserving the same at Selkirk,\" or to establish Winnipeg as a \"central point\" on the main line, was in conflict with para. 13.\nIt may be pointed out, however, that the obligation of the appellant under the covenant was not to establish Winnipeg as a \"central point\" on the main line. What the appellant covenanted to do was to establish and build within the city limits their \"principal workshops for their main line of railway within the province of Manitoba, and for the branches thereof, radiating from the said city\" and to continue them forever within the city, and it would seem obvious that shops for the branches radiating \"from\" the city at least, could hardly, from a practical point of view, be located elsewhere than at Winnipeg. I do not think, either, that the covenant involved any implied obligation upon the appellant to substitute Winnipeg for Selkirk as a \"terminal point\" of the main line. There appears to be involved in this contention of the respondent that the maintenance of the principal workshops at Winnipeg necessarily involved Winnipeg as a \"terminal\" or \"divisional\" point from the standpoint of the operation of the railway, and that as Selkirk and Winnipeg are only some twenty miles apart, the latter would be elbowed out of its position as such a point, contrary to the statute. This argument is, in my opinion, founded on a misconception of the statute.\nPara. 1 of the contract defines four sections of the main line, with Selkirk as the western end of the Lake Superior section, which was to be built by the government, and the eastern end of the central section which was to be completed by the appellant. The \"terminal points\" mentioned by para. 13 have nothing to do, in my opinion, with the operation of the railway but only with construction.\nIt may perfectly well have been, and probably was intended when the statute was passed, that from Selkirk west the main line would run north of Winnipeg, but under the terms of para. 13, the appellant with the concurrence of the Governor in Council, was free to construct the central section of the main line from Selkirk to Winnipeg and then west if it saw fit.\nAs appears from para. 15 of the letters patent, there was already in existence, at the time of the contract, a branch line of railway from Selkirk to Pembina. It appears also from the schedule to c. 13 of the Act of 1879, 42 Vict., that this line was in course of building, and by para. 2 of the contract contained in the schedule to the Act, the government had undertaken to complete the line by August 3rd of that year. Winnipeg or Fort Garry was, of course, on this line. Chapter 14 of 42 Vict, establishes this, if it needs to be established.\nP.C. 1458, dated November 19,1881, shows that the main line had by that time been routed through Winnipeg. That this in no way interfered with the position of Selkirk is clear from the Act of 1882, 45 Vict. c. 53. This statute amends the very paragraph of the contract under consideration, viz., para. 13, with respect to a change in the location of the railway through the Yellow Head Pass, but the statute, by s. 1, shows clearly that Selkirk was still on the main line.\nIf it were necessary to decide as to whether or not the covenant to build and forever maintain the workshops at Winnipeg was a covenant which the company could validly enter into, regard should be had to the principle laid down by Lord Selborne in Attorney General v. Great Eastern Ry. Co. 59, namely, that whatever may fairly be regarded as incidental to, or consequential upon, those things which the legislature has authorized ought not, unless expressly prohibited, to be held by judicial consideration to be ultra vires. However, I do not consider it necessary to decide the question for the reason that, assuming the covenant to have been beyond the power of the company, the respondent, in the circumstances here present, is not now entitled to take the position that its obligation with respect to the exemption from taxation, is no longer binding upon it.\nThe position of the respondent, as set out in its factum, is that the \"purported agreement\" between the parties is void for want of mutuality and that no consideration for the tax exemption was received by the respondent for the agreement or bylaw or the granting of the exemption from taxation, and that the plaintiff did not as a result of or in reliance upon said agreement or any term or terms thereof, exercise any forbearance or change its plans or incur any expense or make any investment or in any way change or alter or prejudice its position or the location, construction or operation of its railway or of any works connected with its railways, or give any consideration. It is said that the giving of the bond and covenant amounted to a covenant by the appellant not to exercise its statutory powers which it had no right to do.\nIn my opinion, it is plain that both parties contracted on the basis that the appellant had the power to give the covenant in question, and each was in as good a position as the other to ascertain whether or not that was so. The contract has been fully executed except as to the future performance on the part of the city as to the maintenance of the tax exemption, and on the part of the appellant as to the maintenance of its shops at their present location. With respect to the point taken as to the lack of power on the part of the company, the view expressed by Lord Cairns L.C. in Ashbury's case at p. 672, is, in my opinion, applicable. There is nothing involved in the covenant, in my view, which \"involves that which is malum prohibitum or malum in se or is a contract contrary to public policy and illegal in itself.\" The question is not \"as to the legality of the contract; the question is as to the competency and power of the company to make the contract.\" The covenant here in question, on the assumption it was beyond the powers of the company, which I make for present purposes, was simply void. Being ultra vires the appellant, and therefore void, there can be no question of damages. Otherwise, the case would fall, in my opinion, within the principle of Boone v. Eyre 60. In that case, the plaintiff had conveyed to the defendant by deed the equity of redemption of a plantation together with the stock of negroes upon it in consideration of \u00a3500 and an annuity of \u00a3160 per annum for his life; and covenanted that he had a good title to the plantation, was lawfully in possession of the negroes, and that the defendant should quietly enjoy. The defendant covenanted, that the plaintiff well and truly performing all and everything therein contained on his part to be performed, he, the defendant, would pay the annuity. The breach assigned was the non-payment of the annuity, while the plea was that the plaintiff was not, at the time of making the deed, legally possessed of the negroes on the plantation, and so had not a good title to convey. On demurrer, it was held by Lord Mansfield that where mutual covenants go to the whole of the consideration on both sides, they are mutual conditions, the one precedent to the other. But where they go only to a part, where a breach may be paid for in damages, there the defendant has a remedy on his covenant and shall not plead it as a condition precedent. Lord Mansfield went on to say,\nIf this plea were to be allowed, any one negro not being the property of the plaintiff would bar the action.\nIn Carter v. Scargill 61, there was in question an agreement between the parties for the sale and purchase of a business the estimated profit of which was \u00a37 per week, and it was agreed that in the event of it being proved by the books of the vendor that the profit should be as stated, the purchaser was to pay the purchase price in specified installments. Possession was taken of the business by the defendant and resold, but in an action to recover the balance of the installments, the position was taken that the plaintiff had not established that the business was as profitable as stated. It was there held by Cockburn C.J., Quain and Field JJ. that that which might have been a condition precedent had ceased to be so by the defendant's subsequent conduct in accepting less than his bargain, with the result that the condition went only to a portion of the consideration and that not a substantial portion.\nWhile the present case is not one in which the respondent may be compensated in damages should it suffer any in the event that the assumed obligation of the appellant to maintain the shops at Winnipeg cannot be enforced against it, I think that the view more fully expressed by my brother Rand as to the proper relief in equity is the correct one. It is past question, in my view, that the case is one for equitable relief rather than that the respondent, having obtained to date everything for which it originally stipulated with the exception of a binding agreement in which the existing status of the shops will be maintained, cannot in conscience be allowed to take the position that its agreement with respect to the tax exemption is no longer to be enforced against it. I think the facts are eminently such as to call for the application of the principle of compensation insofar as performance on the part of the appellant may fall short of that which it would have been obliged to provide if the covenant on its part, and which it asserts to be binding, were binding in law. I therefore agree on this branch of the case with the order proposed by my brother Rand.\nIt is next argued for the respondent that the obligation to maintain the workshops and stockyards \"within the city of Winnipeg\" means within the limits of the city as they existed at the date of the by-law, and that the removal of the workshops in 1903 from their location within the original city to a location outside that area but within the limits of the city at the time of removal, was a breach of contract. It is contended that even if this did not put an end to the exemption in toto, no lands of the appellant company outside the existing limits at the date of the contract are entitled to the exemption.\nIn my opinion, this contention is without merit. Under the terms of para. 8 of the by-law, the exemption was to extend to\nall property now owned, or that hereafter may be owned by them (the company) within the limits of the city of Winnipeg, for railway purposes, or in connection therewith.\nThis provision itself looks to the future, and on the natural reading of the language employed, the words \"within the limits of the city of Winnipeg\" should be held to mean within the limits of the city as they shall from time to time exist. The whole object of the agreement was to induce the continued development and growth of the city, and that being so, it would be in contradiction to the plain meaning of the language to restrict the paragraph to the limits then existing. That that is not even a plausible contention is, I think, borne out by reference to the first recital of the by-law, which is as follows:\nWhereas it is desirable that a line of railway southwesterly from the city of Winnipeg, towards the westerly limit of the province of Manitoba, through the Pembina Mountain District should be built for the purpose of developing and advancing the traffic and trade between the city of Winnipeg and the southern and south western portions of the province.\nWhen one looks at the words \"the city of Winnipeg\" where they secondly appear in the above recital, it is plain, in my opinion, as in the case of para. 8, that the city spoken of there, with respect to which traffic and trade was to be \"developed and advanced,\" meant the city of Winnipeg as it should from time to time develop and expand.\nIt is pointed out on behalf of the respondent that while by-law 148 was passed on September 5, 1881, and the amending by-law on October 30, 1882, the amended by-law was to take effect from September 21, 1880, and it is contended that had the agreement been intended to apply to any territory not within the city at the effective date of the by-law, some express language to that effect would have been employed. In my opinion, this is not the situation to which these provisions were directed.\nIn the first place, the by-law provides for the issue of debentures payable in twenty years from the day \"this by-law takes effect.\" By para. 1, the debentures were made payable on September 20, 1901, and accordingly, the date upon which the by-law should come into operation had to be fixed, as it was fixed by para. 9, on September 21, 1881. In addition, the provincial Act of 1875, 38 Vict. c. 50, provided by s. 931 that any by-law for contracting debts by borrowing money would be valid only if the by-law should name a day in the financial year in which the same was passed when the by-law should take effect. I think it is clear, therefore, that the contention under consideration is not well founded.\nIt is also contended on behalf of the appellant that the exemption extends to so-called business taxes. As this point is concluded in this court by our decision in Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Attorney General for Saskatchewan 62, effect must be given to this contention.\nThe remaining question is as to whether or not the exempting provision extends to the Royal Alexandra Hotel and restaurant of the appellant company. The hotel is a modern, high class structure of a well known type, having six floors with 445 rooms available for guests. It is one of a system maintained by the appellant company across the country. While it serves to draw traffic to the appellant's railway, it is not only available to the travelling public generally, but serves the local community in providing suitable space for entertainment and public functions as well as for more or less permanent guests. It is also used by the appellant to lodge employees from time to time, and it is a convenient place for the holding of railway conferences, and passengers are, at times, accommodated there in emergencies. The hotel laundry looks after some of the laundry for the railway.\nIt is to be observed that the only property which the by-law exempts is property owned by the appellant for \"railway purposes or in connection therewith,\" i.e. in connection with \"railway\" purposes. As pointed out by their Lordships in Canadian Pacific Railway v. Attorney General for British Columbia 63, a company may be authorized to carry on, and may in fact carry on, more than one undertaking, but merely because the company is a railway company, it does not follow that all its activities must relate to its railway undertaking. As shown by the evidence, the first Canadian Pacific hotels were established in the Rocky Mountains. Because of the very heavy grades existing in the early days, the trains were not able to have diners, and it was necessary that they be stopped at convenient points to enable the passengers to take food and rest. That day has long since passed, and hotels of the type at present under consideration do not owe their existence to any necessity in connection with the operation of the railway proper.\nAs pointed out earlier in this judgment, the company was incorporated for the purpose of carrying out the contract of October 21, 1881, and for no other purpose. The power to erect the mountain hotels was no doubt incidental to the powers conferred upon the company at its incorporation, but until 1902 the company did not have the power to go into the hotel business in connection with such hotels as the Royal Alexandra at Winnipeg and the Empress at Victoria.\nTheir Lordships in the Empress case state that the case with which they were dealing was not the case of an hotel conducted solely or even principally for the benefit of travellers on the system of the appellant company, and that there was little to distinguish the Empress Hotel from an independently owned hotel in a similar position. The same applies with equal force to the Royal Alexandra. No doubt, the fact that there is a large and well managed hotel at Winnipeg does tend to increase traffic on the appellant system, and it may be that the appellant's railway business and hotel business help each other, but that does not prevent them from being separate businesses or undertakings which, in my view, is the case so far as the Royal Alexandra is concerned.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the conduct of such an hotel as the Royal Alexandra was not within the contemplation of the contracting parties at the time of the passing of by-law 148, and I do not think that such an hotel is. owned by the company for \"railway\" purposes or \"in connection therewith\" within the meaning of the by-law. The fact that the business of the hotel may be operated in connection with the business of the railway does not, in my opinion, make the hotel exempt property within the meaning of para. 8 of the by-law. That the hotel is in physical connection with the appellant's Winnipeg railway station does not affect the matter.\nBy an agreement of August 4, 1906, entered into between the appellant and the respondent at a time when, by c. 57 of the Statutes of Manitoba, 63-64 Vict. (1900) s. 18, the property of the appellant company within the city was exempt from municipal taxation, it was arranged that the appellant should pay a stated sum to the respondent in lieu of taxation in respect of the hotel \"if the same were anyway liable to any taxation.\" The appellant points to the first recital in the agreement which states that the company has built \"in connection with its railway and the operation thereof\", as a recognition that the hotel is owned by the company in connection with \"railway purposes\" within the meaning of by-law 148. The agreement contains a further recital, however, that the \"city has claimed that said hotel property should be made subject to municipal taxation on the grounds that an hotel was not originally included within the meaning of a railway\" enterprise. In view of this, I think that the first recital cannot be taken as a recognition that the hotel was to be considered as within the meaning of the agreement of 1881, but rather the contrary.\nI further think that the words in the first recital, \"in connection with its railway and the operation thereof,\" have not the same meaning as the words, \"property owned for railway purposes or in connection therewith,\" in by-law 148. In the case of the latter, the property dealt with was property owned for the purpose of the construction and operation of the railway described in the statute of 1881, while the property referred to in the first recital of the agreement of 1906 was property acquired by virtue of the express power granted to the appellant by s. 8 of its Act of 1902 by which it was authorized to conduct an hotel business \"for the purposes of its railway and steamships and in connection with its business\" of operating the railway, which in 1881 had been its exclusive business. The first recital in the agreement of 1906 is evidently based on this legislation. Moreover, as by-law 148 and the amending by-law required and received validation at the hands of the provincial legislature, it was not competent for the city, without further legislation, to vary by any act or conduct, the terms of the agreement evidenced by the by-law.\nIn my opinion, therefore, appellant derives no assistance from anything contained in the agreement of 1906. In 1909, amending legislation was passed, by the provincial legislature which deprived the hotel of its exemption from municipal taxation, following which, in 1914 and 1942, further agreements were made between the parties with respect to payment to the city by the appellant in respect of the hotel property in lieu of municipal assessment. The appellant again says that these agreements are a recognition that the respondent construed the exemption in by-law 148 as extending to the hotel in question. I do not think, however, that, apart from enabling legislation, it was competent for the city in this way to extend the meaning of the words used in 1881, or to exempt property, which by general law was subject to taxation. I think, therefore, the appellant's contention with respect to the hotel fails. We heard no argument that, in this event, the restaurant could be considered in any other position.\nIn the result, the appellant succeeds substantially, and should have three-quarters of the costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal. The judgment of the trial judge should be restored with the variation indicated above as to the hotel and restaurant. The order as to costs at trial should not be interfered with.\nThe judgment of Estey and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by:\nEstey J.:\u2014The Canadian Pacific Railway Company (hereinafter referred to as the company) contends that it is exempt from realty and business taxes assessed and levied in the year 1948 by the city of Winnipeg (hereinafter referred to as the city). This contention is based upon an agreement made between the city and the company in 1881 under which the company undertook to build 100 miles of railway southwest from the city, a passenger station and stockyards in the city and to execute and deliver to the city a bond and covenant under its corporate seal to the effect that the company would\nbuild within the limits of the city of Winnipeg, their principal workshops for the mainline of the Canadian Pacific Railway within the province of Manitoba, and the branches thereof radiating from Winnipeg, within the limits of the said province, and for ever continue the same within the said city of Winnipeg.\nThe city, on its part, undertook to issue debentures in the sum of $200,000 at 6 per cent, payable to the company on September 20, 1901, and to convey to the company the land upon which the station was constructed. This agreement also included the following provision:\n8. Upon the fulfilment by the said company of the conditions and stipulations hereinmentioned, by the said Canadian Pacific Railway Company all property now owned, or that hereafter may be owned by them within the limits of the city of Winnipeg, for railway purposes, or in connection therewith shall be forever free and exempt from all municipal taxes, rates, and levies, and assessments of every nature and kind.\nThis agreement is set out in by-law 148 as passed by the city on September 5, 1881, and amended by by-law 195 passed by the city on October 30, 1882. Apart from extending the time for completing the 100 miles of railway and the passenger depot and cancelling the first two interest coupons on the debentures, by-law 195 effected no other changes. The province of Manitoba in 1883, by statute (46-47 Vict., S. of M. 1883, c. 64), declared that the by-laws (148 and 195) were \"legal, binding and valid upon the said the mayor and council of the city of Winnipeg \u2026\" It is conceded that the company has not made default under this agreement, that the city conveyed the land and delivered the debentures and, apart from an unsuccessful attempt, The Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. The City of Winnipeg 64, to levy school taxes for the years 1890-94, no further or other taxes have been levied in respect of this property by the city until 1948, from which the company in this litigation claims exemption.\nThe four main questions raised, and all decided by the learned trial judge in favour of the company, are as follows:\n(a) Is the agreement between the city and the company, contained in by-laws 148 and 195, valid and binding?\n(b) If valid and binding, is the exemption operative only within the limits of the city of Winnipeg as these existed at the time the agreement was made or as these limits have been from time to time constituted? (c) If the agreement is valid and binding, is the exemption therein provided for applicable to the Royal Alexandra Hotel and restaurant of the company within the city of Winnipeg?\n(d) If the agreement is valid and binding, does the exemption therein provided for include the business tax?\nIn the Appellate Court the decision of the learned trial judge on question (a) was affirmed, but a majority of that court reversed the learned trial judge upon questions (b), (c) and (d).\nThe city contends that while the Canadian Pacific Railway Company was incorporated by letters patent under the Great Seal of Canada dated February 16, 1881, it is not a common law corporation endowed with the powers of an individual, but is, in effect, a statutory corporation and, therefore, can exercise only those powers expressly provided in, or necessarily implied from the terms of incorporation and that these terms do not expressly, or by necessary implication, give to the company the powers to bind itself forever, as it purported to do by the agreement of September 5, 1881.\nThe original agreement for the construction and operation of the Canadian Pacific Railway executed between a group therein styled \"the company\" and the government of Canada, under date of October 21, 1880, contemplated an Act of incorporation as evidenced by para. 21 thereof:\n21. The company to be incorporated, with sufficient powers to enable them to carry out the foregoing contract, and this contract shall only be binding in the event of an Act of incorporation being granted to the company in the form hereto appended as Schedule A.\nBefore the statute (44 Vict., S. of C. 1881, c. 1) approving and ratifying this contract was enacted it was evidently deemed desirable to provide for an alternative method of incorporation and accordingly sec. 2 of that statute provided:\n2. For the purpose of incorporating the persons mentioned in the said contract, and those who shall be associated with them in the undertaking, and of granting to them the powers necessary to enable them to carry out the said contract according to the terms thereof, the Governor may grant to them in conformity with the said contract, under the corporate name of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, a charter conferring upon them the franchises, privileges and powers embodied in the schedule to the said contract and to this Act appended, and such charter, being published in the Canada Gazette, with any Order or Orders in Council relating to it, shall have force and effect as if it were an Act of the Parliament of Canada, and shall be held to be an Act of incorporation within the meaning of the said contract. The language of this s. 2 is consistent with the view that Parliament intended the letters patent should be issued by the Governor General in, the exercise of the prerogative right. At the outset it is provided that\nFor the purpose of incorporating \u2026 and of granting to them the powers necessary to enable them to carry out the said contract according to the terms thereof \u2026\nThis wide and comprehensive language is not limited or restricted by the provision\na charter conferring upon them the franchises, privileges and powers embodied in the schedule to the said contract \u2026\nThe position is similar to that in the Bonanza Creek case 65, where, though granted in accord with the statute, the letters patent were granted by the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario in the exercise of the prerogative right. The company, therefore, was endowed with the powers and capacities of a natural person, subject to any limitations or restrictions imposed by the statute.\nMoreover, while this alternative method is provided in the same statute (S. of C. 1882, c. 1) in which statutory effect is given to sec. 21 of the contract, under which it was contemplated incorporation would be by statute, it was, as already pointed out, arranged for at a date subsequent to the contract. In these circumstances the intent and purpose of Parliament in making this alternative provision would be to provide something different in effect from that of incorporation by statute, and in the absence, as here, of any specific explanation, that intent and purpose would appear to be that if letters patent were issued the Governor General would do so in the exercise of the prerogative right and thereby give to the company the powers and capacities of a natural person, possessed only by corporations created in that manner, subject to such limitations or restrictions as the statute imposed.\nThe position is somewhat analogous to that in Elve v. Boyton 66, where it was contended that a company incorporated by letters patent pursuant to a statute (6 Geo. I, 1719, c. 19) was not incorporated by an Act of Parliament. Lindley, L.J., with whom Lopes, L.J., agreed, stated at p. 508:\nThe answer is, it would have been impossible, without the Act of Parliament, to create such a corporation by that charter or any other charter. The real truth is, that, if you look at it very closely, the corporation owed its birth and creation to the joint effect of the charter and of the Act of Parliament, and you can no more neglect the Act of Parliament than you can neglect the charter.\nThe language of Lindley L. J., is particularly apt as, apart from s. 2 above quoted, the company could not have been, in 1881, incorporated by letters patent. Parliament had, in 1877, expressly prohibited that possibility by providing that the incorporation of companies for the \"construction and operation of railways\" could not be effected by \"Letters Patent under the Great Seal\" (40 Vict., S. of C. 1877, c. 43, s. 3). When, therefore, it was decided that the alternative method of incorporation by letters patent should be made available, it was necessary that such be provided for by an express statutory provision, as indeed it was in s. 2.\nThis statute (44 Vict., S. of C. 1881, c. 1) was assented to on February 15, 1881, and on the following day letters patent were issued under the Great Seal of Canada incorporating the company. These letters patent recited the contract of the 21st of October, 1880, and the foregoing s. 2 and that \"the said persons have prayed for a charter for the purpose aforesaid\" and then provided:\nNow know ye, that, by and with the advice of our Privy Council for Canada, and under the authority of the hereinbefore in part recited Act, and of any other power and authority whatsoever in us vested in this behalf, We Do, by these our Letters Patent, grant, order, declare and provide * * * are hereby constituted a body corporate and politic, by the name of the \"Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\"\nThe reference to statutory authority in the foregoing paragraph immediately followed by the words \"and of any other power and authority whatsoever in us vested in this behalf,\" with great respect to those who entertain a contrary view, leads rather to the conclusion that the Governor General, in issuing the letters patent, acted not only pursuant to the statutory but to another authority separate and apart therefrom which, in the circumstances, could be only the prerogative right. 6 Halsbury, 2nd Ed., p. 459, s. 547. The words \"in this behalf,\" again with great respect, do not, in this context, refer to the contract but rather the power and authority to issue letters patent for the incorporation of companies. In the Bonanza Creek case supra the letters patent, apart from the inclusion of the word \"Statute\" instead of \"Act,\" included the following identical words that appear in the foregoing :\nunder .the authority of the hereinbefore in part recited Act, and of any other power and authority whatsoever in Us vested in this behalf.\nThe phrase \"in part recited Statute,\" in the Bonanza Creek letters patent, refers to the Companies Act of Ontario (R.S.O.1897, c. 191), s. 9 of which reads, in part, as follows:\nThe Lieutenant-Governor in Council may, by letters patent, grant a charter * * * creating and constituting * * * a body corporate and politic for any of the purposes or objects to which the legislative authority of the Legislature of Ontario extends, except the construction and working of railways, * * * *\nViscount Haldane points out that s. 9 of the Ontario Act corresponds to s. 5 of the Dominion Companies Act (R.S.C. 1906, c. 79), the predecessor of which is s. 3 of the Companies Act of 1877 (40 Vict., S. of C. 1877, c. 43). While letters patent were not granted to the company under any of the foregoing general statutory provisions, they would, no doubt, be present to the minds of the parties when determining the method of incorporation.\nThe contract, statute and charter must all be construed in relation to the circumstances that obtained in 1880 and 1881. The construction, maintenance and operation of the railway was then an undertaking of the greatest magnitude. Parliament, particularly because of its obligations to British Columbia under the terms and conditions of the latter's admission into Confederation, desired not only that the railway should be constructed, but that its maintenance and operation should be efficient. It had provided that two parts of the railway should be constructed by the government of Canada and, when completed, handed over to the company. It was in these circumstances that Parliament enacted the provisions in s. 2 that, as an alternative to the incorporation by the Act of Parliament, letters patent might be issued. The language then adopted, particularly when construed in relation to the letters patent, as well as the circumstances of 1880 and 1881, discloses an intention that these were issued in the exercise of the prerogative right and thereby ensure to the company the benefits and advantages of that method of incorporation, subject only to the provisions of the statute. Even if, however, the letters patent incorporating the company were not issued by the Governor General in the exercise of his prerogative right, but rather in the exercise of a power delegated to him by the statute, and, therefore, the company must be treated as if it had been incorporated by statute, it would seem that the power to execute the contract here in question would be necessarily incidental to those powers expressed in the charter. That it was present to the minds of the parties that the company would be called upon to pay taxes is evident from the fact that they had provided for certain property of the company to be forever exempt in the contract with the government (cl. 16). In the same contract (cl. 7) the company agreed to \"forever efficiently maintain, work and run the Canadian Pacific Railway.\" Under these circumstances the power to make agreements binding forever with respect to payment of and exemption from taxes would be included, or at least necessarily incidental to the powers conferred upon the company by the words \"granting to them the powers necessary to enable them to carry out the said contract according to the terms thereof,\" (S. 2 supra). This provision is in accord with cl. 21 of the contract, where it was provided:\nThe company to be incorporated, with sufficient powers to enable them to carry out the foregoing contract, * * *\nand all this is implemented in the letters patent where it is provided that the company shall possess\nAll the franchises and powers necessary or useful to the company to enable them to carry out, perform, enforce, use, and avail themselves of, every condition, stipulation, obligation, duty, right, remedy, privilege, and advantage agreed upon, contained or described in the said contract * * * *\nIt is not suggested that at the time the contract with the city was made, or at any time thereafter, it has not proved useful to the company.\nThe concluding words of s. 2 above quoted make it clear that, while the charter is not an Act of Parliament, it shall have the force and effect thereof and shall be held to be in compliance with the provisions of the contract relative to incorporation. This provision was necessary by virtue of the terms of cl. 21 of the contract and it would appear that that was the only reason for its insertion. In either view, the company, in executing the contract, did not exceed its powers as provided in its charter. This distinguishes this case from that of the Whitby v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co. 67, where the contract to erect and maintain the chief workshops of the company at Whitby was held to be beyond the powers given to the company incorporated in Ontario by 31 Vict., c. 42.\nThe company's covenant to \"for ever continue\" its principal workshops for the main line in Manitoba and the branch lines radiating out of the city and within the province does not offend against the principle that a company incorporated and entrusted with powers and duties by the legislature \"cannot enter into any contract or take any action incompatible with the due exercise of its powers or the discharge of its duties.\" 8 Halsbury, 2nd Ed., 74, para. 126.\nThe contention of the city is that this covenant is incompatible with the company's obligation to \"forever efficiently maintain, work and run the Canadian Pacific Railway.\" The foregoing principle was applied in Montreal Park and Island Railway Company v. Chateauguay and Northern Ry. Co. 68, where Davies J. (later C.J.C.), with whom Girouard J. agreed, stated at p. 57:\n* * * the courts ought not to enforce and will not enforce an agreement by which a chartered company undertakes to bind itself not to use or carry out its chartered powers. I do not think such an agreement ought to be enforced because it is against public policy.\nThe learned judge went on to explain that if the company can covenant not to exercise its powers in part it may do so in whole and that\nThe courts have no right to speculate whether Parliament would or would not have granted these chartered powers to the defendant company over the limited area. Parliament alone can enact the limitation, and neither courts of justice nor companies can substitute themselves for Parliament.\nSee also Winch v. Birkenhead, Lancashire and Cheshire Junction Ry. Co. 69; Ayr Harbour Trustees v. Oswald 70; Town of Eastview v. Roman Catholic Episcopal Corp. of Ottawa 71; Re Heywood's Conveyance 72. The company's powers do not require the construction of its said principal workshops in any particular place in the province of Manitoba. They might, therefore, have been placed by the company at any point that it might have selected. What is significant is that its placing of them in the city has never been regarded as inconsistent or incompatible with its duty to forever maintain and operate the railway efficiently. In other words, the complaint is not that the company has failed or contracted not to exercise its power, but only that it has contracted not to exercise that power elsewhere in the province of Manitoba than the city of Winnipeg. That city may always remain the proper place for the maintenance of these principal workshops. Therefore, the language of the contract does not disclose any inconsistency or incompatibility with the company's duty. The city, however, suggests that future events, such as war, floods or other emergency, amalgamation or development in transportation equipment or methods may require the company, in the discharge of its duty, to move these principal workshops elsewhere, which would then be prevented by virtue of the existence of this covenant to forever maintain them in Winnipeg.\nThis is not a case, therefore, such as the Montreal Park and Island Railway Co. supra where the company contracted not to construct its railway in an area where its powers authorized it to do so. It is equally distinguishable from Ayr Harbour Trustees v. Oswald supra where the trustees purported to bind themselves in respect to the use of land and thereby to impose restrictions upon their use thereof, contrary to the purpose as contemplated under the statute under which they had acquired same. In both of these cases the language of the covenant was incompatible with the due exercise of the company's power. On the same basis the other cases above mentioned are also distinguishable.\nMoreover, where, as already pointed out, the language of the covenant is not, upon its face, inconsistent or incompatible with the due exercise of the powers and the performance of the duties of the company, then, as pointed out by Lindley L.J., in Grand Junction Canal Co. v. Petty 73, the presence of incompatibility must be established by evidence. This view was referred to by Lord Sumner in Birkdale District Electric Supply Co. v. Corporation of Southport 74, and where, as here, no evidence is adduced, the statements of Lord Sumner would appear relevant where, at p. 375, he states:\nIn the present case the company's activities have not yet been and may never be impaired by the agreement at all. So far it may have been and probably has been safe and beneficial. How, then, can it have been ultra vires hitherto?\nThese remarks are particularly applicable because the possible incompatibility here present is founded upon the future possibility that these workshops, as located, would prevent the efficient management of the Canadian Pacific Railway. In such circumstances a finding of incompatibility should be established by evidence and not founded upon speculations as to the future, particularly in respect of a company that has been carrying on for over seventy years in a manner that in no way constitutes a suggested inconsistency or incompatibility.\nNo case was cited, nor have we found one, which, in principle, would justify the decree here requested, where the incompatibility is neither apparent from the language used nor established by evidence, but is supported only upon the possibility of future events which, even if they should occur, might not require the removal of the workshops in order that the railway might be efficiently maintained and operated and, therefore, would not establish the suggested incompatibility.\nMoreover, it should be noted that the covenant here in question is concerned only with the principal workshops and, therefore, what other workshops may be necessary may be constructed by the company at such points in Manitoba as it may deem necessary or desirable.\nCounsel on behalf of the city contends that it had no power to pass by-laws 148 and 195. The city derives its corporate powers from the province of Manitoba and even if, at the time, the province had not vested the city with the necessary power to pass the by-laws, any deficiency in that regard was supplied when the province enacted 46-47 Vict., S. of M. 1883, c. 64, declaring these by-laws 148 and 195 to be \"legal, binding and valid upon the said the mayor and council of the city of Winnipeg * * * *\" This language does not support the city's contention that the statute merely validated the power of the city to enter into the agreement with the company and did not validate the agreement itself. The view that it did validate the agreement is not only supported by the foregoing language, but is strengthened by the language of the recital of the statute which reads, in part:\nAnd whereas, it is deemed expedient to set at rest all doubts that may exist as to the validity of any or all the above in part recited by-laws and the debentures issued thereunder, and to legalize and confirm the same, and each of them respectively.\nThe city of Winnipeg possessed the authority to enact by-laws, but it was the terms or the substance of by-laws 148 and 195 that gave rise to the questions as to their validity and the legislature resolved these questions by the foregoing enactment. In Ontario Power Co. of Niagara Falls v. Municipal Corporation of Stamford 75, where similar questions were raised, the legislature of Ontario \"legalized, confirmed, and declared to be legal, valid and binding * * *\" the by-law. Then once the terms of the by-law were validated there remained only the question of the construction of the terms thereof.\nIt was also submitted that the agreement was negotiated under the mistaken belief that it would assure the passage of the main line of the railway through the city of Winnipeg. By-laws 148 and 195 do not contain any undertaking on the part of the company to construct the main line through that city. On the contrary, throughout these by-laws it is rather assumed, as indeed the fact was, that the main line had already been altered to run through that city. In the recital Winnipeg is declared to be \"a central point on the main line\" and in the operative part the company undertakes to \"establish and build within the limits of the city of Winnipeg, their principal workshops for the main line * * * *\". It, therefore, appears that the parties were contracting upon the basis that the main line had already been altered to run through the city of Winnipeg and, therefore, there was no misunderstanding or mistake as to the facts in relation to which they were contracting, nor was there any failure of consideration. The city contends that the company's obligation to build their principal workshops \"within the limits of the city of Winnipeg\" should be construed to mean the limits as constituted on September 5, 1881, the date of the passage of by-law 148. It is important to observe that this phrase is not contained in an enactment of a law providing merely for an exemption from taxation, but is rather a law embodying the terms of an agreement in which the city, in consideration of undertakings to be, and, in fact, later executed by the company, obligated itself to exempt the company from taxation as therein provided. In these circumstances it should be construed, as stated by Lord Sumner, as \"one of bargain and of mutual advantage,\" rather than as a statute providing for an exemption from taxation. City of Halifax v. Nova Scotia Car Works Ltd. 76. When the contract, as set out in by-law 148, is read as a whole, the conclusion is inevitable that the parties were looking to the future. The railway was not entirely constructed. The route of its main line had been altered to pass through Winnipeg. It would, when in operation, open up a vast new territory and Winnipeg was anxious to become an important commercial and railway centre. With this end in view, it agreed to help the company if the latter would construct certain facilities within its boundaries. The first recital states that 100 miles of railway southwest out of Winnipeg\nshould be built for the purpose of developing and advancing the traffic and trade between the city of Winnipeg and * * * *\nThe second recital emphasizes the establishment and continuation of the principal workshops and the stock yards. Then in the operative part, particularly in para. 4, the company undertakes to\nerect * * * large and commodious stock or cattle yards, suitable and appropriate for the central business of their main line of railway and the several branches thereof.\nAt the time this covenant was given there was at Winnipeg neither main line nor branch lines and, of course, no railway business, and, while it is not necessary to determine the precise extent of this undertaking, it is obvious that it was looking to future circumstances. There is found, therefore, both in the recital and the operative parts, language that supports the view that the parties were, in this contract, looking to the future development of both the railway and the city. In so far as the contract provided for the debentures of $200,000 and the payment therefor, it could only deal with the limits as then constituted.\nIt is significant that between the passage of by-laws 148 and 195 the area of the city of Winnipeg was more than doubled. By-law 148 was passed on September 5, 1881. The legislation providing for the enlargement of the city boundaries was assented to on May 30, 1882. About five months thereafter, on October 30, 1882, by-law 195 was passed amending by-law 148. Therefore, the amendment to by-law 148 contained in by-law 195 was passed at a time when the extension of the boundaries would be present to the minds of the mayor and the council of the city. If, therefore, the parties had intended in their contract, as evidenced by by-law 148, that the words \"within the limits of the city of Winnipeg\" meant the limits as they then existed, and those limits only, the possibility of misunderstanding and the desirability of clarification would have been equally present to their minds when amending by-law 148 by the passing of by-law 195. In these circumstances, had it been intended that the contract should forever apply only to the limits as fixed at the date of the contract, apt words would have been included in by-law 195 to give expression to that intention.\nIt is contended that, because by-law 148 specified that it should take effect as of the 21st day of September, 1881, and this date was carried forward in by-law 195, that the parties intended the words \"within the limits of the city of Winnipeg\" to mean the limits as constituted at the date of the contract. It is important to observe that the statute (37 Vict., S. of M. 1873, c. 7) incorporating the city of Winnipeg, as amended in 1875 (38 Vict., S. of M. 1875, c. 50, s. 93, subsec. 1), provided that a by-law such as 148 would not be valid unless it set out a day when the by-law should take effect. In accordance with that provision, by-law 148 set out that it should take effect on the 21st day of September, 1881. It had a particular significance in this case because the debentures were to be granted by way of bonus payable in twenty years from the day this by-law was to take effect with interest at 6 per cent per annum. Any amendment, therefore, changing this date would affect the provisions for the issue of the debentures which were left, apart from that with respect to the first two coupons, entirely unchanged by the by-law 195. In these circumstances the fact that this provision was carried forward in identical language in by-law 195 does not support a conclusion that the parties intended thereby that the exemption should apply only to the boundaries of the city of Winnipeg as constituted on the date of the contract.\nThe workshops, as originally constructed, were within the limits of the city of Winnipeg as it existed at the time of the execution of the contract, and there remained, until 1903, when they were moved and reconstructed upon a location within the area added to the city in 1882. The city now, so far as the record discloses, for the first time contends that this removal of the workshops constituted a breach of the conditions of the contract and of the bond and covenant given as provided. This removal was openly made in a manner that could not but have been known to the officials of the city of Winnipeg. They did not then nor at any time have they made any objection thereto and have never sought to impose taxes thereon.\nThe subsequent conduct of the parties may be looked at, not to add to or vary the contract, but to assist in determining the intent and meaning of the parties. The record discloses that throughout the period from 1881 to date the city of Winnipeg has not, at any time, suggested that the phrase \"within the limits of the city of Winnipeg\" meant the limits as constituted at the date of the contract, but, on the contrary, the terms of the contract itself and the subsequent conduct of the parties indicate that such was never intended. City of Calgary v. The Canadian Western Natural Gas Co. 77.\nIt is suggested that in using the words \"within the limits of the city of Winnipeg\" the parties intended to designate the boundaries as then constituted, particularly as in other parts of the by-law the phrase used is \"in the city of Winnipeg.\" It will be observed that in the second recital it is stated that the company have agreed to establish and continue their principal workshops and stock yards for the province of Manitoba \"in the city of Winnipeg\"; that with respect to the stock or cattle yards the company undertook to erect them \"within the city of Winnipeg.\" When they come to the exempting paragraph (cl. 8) they again use the words \"on property now owned or that hereafter may be owned by them within the limits of the city of Winnipeg.\" It does not appear to me, in these circumstances, that the parties had in mind any particular distinction between the words \"within the city of Winnipeg\" and \"within the limits of the city of Winnipeg.\"\nWhen the contract is read as a whole and regard is had to the purpose and object thereof, as well as the circumstances surrounding the parties as they negotiated and executed it, and the subsequent conduct of the parties, particularly that of the city, one is led to the conclusion that the parties were contracting in respect of Winnipeg as an entity, regardless of its boundaries at any particular time, and, therefore, the exemption is applicable to areas that have been subsequently included within the boundaries of the city.\nThe company was authorized to own and operate hotels in 1902 (2 Edw. VII, S. of C. 1902, c. 52). Under this authority it constructed, in 1906, the Royal Alexandra Hotel, and it is now contended by the city that the Royal Alexandra Hotel and the restaurant therein are not included within the scope of the exemption set out in para. 8 of bylaw 148, wherein it is provided, in part, that\nall property now owned, or that hereafter may be owned * * * within the limits of the city of Winnipeg, for railway purposes, or in connection therewith shall be forever free and exempt from all municipal taxes, rates, and levies, and assessments of every nature and kind.\nThe evidence in this case establishes that the hotel is adjoining the railway station and physically attached thereto; that \"the railway uses the hotel services extensively\"; that through the medium of its restaurant, dining room and other hotel facilities it provides food and lodging to passengers and employees of the company. It is conceded that these services are available to and utilized by the general public; the laundry in the hotel provides services to the sleeping and dining car department of the railway; that in the hotel \"railway conferences and staff meetings are held\"; that supplies for the hotel are provided or purchased for the hotel by the railway purchasing department. The language of the exemption does not require that the property should be used exclusively \"for railway purposes or in connection therewith\" and, having regard to the evidence adduced in this case, it cannot but be concluded that even if the Royal Alexandra Hotel and restaurant are not used for railway purposes they are used \"in connection therewith\" and, therefore, within the terms of the exemption.\nThis case must be determined upon the language adopted by the parties, which raises issues quite distinct from that of determining whether the Empress Hotel was an integral part of the Canadian Pacific Railway system within the meaning of the British North America Act. Canadian Pacific By. Co. v. The Attorney General of British Columbia 78.\nIt is suggested that, because the Canadian Pacific Railway Company was not authorized to own and operate hotels until 1902, the exemption provided for in 1881 cannot be said to cover an enterprise which, at that date, would have been illegal. In the construction and operation of this hotel the company has acted within the authority granted to it by the statute of 1902. As already indicated, the company had, from the date of its incorporation, all the powers possessed at common law by a corporation created by charter. Even if this were not so, it is my opinion that, while the parties to the contract did not contemplate illegal acts, they did contemplate that as the enterprise developed significant changes would be made and, therefore, provided that not only the property \"now owned\" but also \"that hereafter may be owned\" by the company \"shall be forever free and exempt.\" The fact that in 1902 the company was granted further statutory powers does not limit or restrict the meaning and effect of the words \"that hereafter may be owned.\" The Royal Alexandra Hotel and the restaurant are, therefore, included within the language of the foregoing exemption.\nIn 1906, in 1914 and again in 1942 the parties to this litigation entered into agreements under which the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. paid certain amounts in lieu of taxation in respect of the hotel. These agreements disclose that there was a disagreement as to whether the property was taxable and that in lieu of determining the issue the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. agreed to pay, and the city to accept, the specified amounts. Counsel for both parties ask that certain conclusions be drawn favourable to their respective contentions from the language used, but, having regard to the nature and character of the agreement and the language used, no conclusion ought to be drawn that would assist either party in determining their rights in these matters. These agreements were essentially made in lieu of the determination of those rights.\nThen with respect to the validity of the business tax, prior to 1893 the city of Winnipeg was authorized to impose taxation upon real and personal property. In that year, by an amendment to the Assessment Act (56 Vict., c. 24), the city was no longer empowered to impose taxation upon personal property but was authorized to impose a business tax and it was expressly provided that this tax was \"levied in lieu of a tax upon personal property.\" This has since been continued and is now found in the charter of the city of Winnipeg (S. of M. 1940, c. 81, as amended in 1948 by S. of M., c. 92) as sec. 291(1):\n291. (1) * * * every person carrying on any business in the city whether he resides therein or not shall be assessed for a sum equal to the annual rental value of the premises * * *\nand s. 9 provides:\n9. Nothing in this Act shall\n(a) injure, affect, prejudice, or cause the forfeiture or impairment of, the benefit, right, exemption, or privilege, if any, of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company under\n(i) by-laws numbered respectively 148 and 195 or any other by-law of the city of Winnipeg; * * *\nApart from this statutory recognition of the exemptions created by by-laws 148 and 195 with respect to the business tax, the language of this exemption which we are here considering\u2014\"all property now owned, or that hereafter may be owned * * * shall be forever free and exempt from all municipal taxes, rates, and levies, and assessments of every nature and kind.\"\u2014is even more broad and comprehensive than that in cl. 16 considered in Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Attorney General for Saskatchewan 79, where this court held that the business tax was included within the exemption there provided for. The principle of that decision resolves this issue in favour of the company. The appeal should be allowed. The costs at trial should remain as directed by the Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench for Manitoba. The appellant Canadian Pacific Railway Co. should have its costs in the Court of Appeal. In this court the two appeals, by order of Mr. Justice Kerwin, were consolidated and proceeded with as one appeal. The appellant Canadian Pacific Railway Company should have its costs in this court.\nLocke J.:\u2014By the agreement which provided for the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway made between Her Majesty, acting in respect of the Dominion of Canada, and George Stephen and others, referred to therein as the company, dated October 21, 1880, it was provided inter alia that the portions of the proposed line which were to be built by the latter should be completed and in running order on or before May 1, 1891, and after providing that the portions to be constructed by the government of Canada should be duly completed and then conveyed to the company, the latter agreed to \"thereafter and forever efficiently maintain, work and run the Canadian Pacific Railway\". In addition to the land grant and subsidy in money provided by the contract, it was agreed that there should be granted to the company the lands required for its road-bed, stations, station grounds, buildings, yards and other appurtenances required for the convenient and effectual construction and working of the railway, in so far as such land should be vested in the government, and that, in addition, there should be admitted free of duty all steel rails and a number of other enumerated articles required for the construction of the road free of duty. By a further term, it was stipulated that the company should have the right, subject to the approval of the Governor in Council to lay out and locate the line of the railway.\nThe first reference to the incorporation of a company appears in paragraph 17 of this contract which commences:\nThe company shall be authorized by their Act of incorporation to issue bonds, etc. * * * *\nand this is followed by the language which has given rise to so much discussion in the present matter, incorporated in sections 21 and 22 which reads:\n21. The company to be incorporated, with sufficient powers to enable them to carry out the foregoing contract, and this contract shall only be binding in the event of an Act of incorporation being granted to the company in the form hereto appended as Schedule A.\n22. The Railway Act of 1879, in so far as the provisions of the same are applicable to the undertaking referred to in this contract, and in so far as they are not inconsistent herewith or inconsistent with or contrary to the provisions of the Act of Incorporation to be granted to the company, shall apply to the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nSchedule A to the contract bears the heading \"Incorporation\" and is expressed in the language in common use for the incorporation of companies by private Acts. Section 4 of this document reads:\nAll the franchises and powers necessary or useful to the company to enable them to carry out, perform, enforce, use, and avail themselves of, every condition, stipulation, obligation, duty, right, remedy, privilege, and advantage agreed upon, contained or described in the said contract, are hereby conferred upon the company. And the enactment of the special provisions hereinafter contained shall not be held to impair or derogate from the generality of the franchises and powers so hereby conferred upon them.\nBy chapter I of the Statutes of Canada, 1881, assented to on February 15th of that year, the contract was approved and ratified by Parliament and the government authorized to perform and carry out its conditions. While s. 21 of the contract made it clear that what was contemplated was that the company to be formed should be created by an Act of Parliament, the statute contained as s. 2 the following provision:\nFor the purpose of incorporating the persons mentioned in the said contract and those who shall be associated with them in the undertaking and of granting to them the powers necessary to enable them to carry out the said contract according to the terms thereof, the Governor may grant to them in conformity with the said contract, under the corporate name of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, a charter conferring upon them the franchises, privileges and powers embodied in the schedule to the said contract and to this Act appended, and such charter, being published in the Canada Gazette, with any Order or Orders in Council relating to it, shall have force and effect as if it were an Act of the Parliament of Canada, and shall be held to be an Act of Incorporation within the meaning of the said contract.\nWhat was meant by the word \"charter\" in this section was immediately made clear. On February 16, 1881, letters patent of incorporation under the Great Seal of Canada were issued incorporating the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. There is apparently no explanation as to why this procedure for the incorporation of the company was followed rather than that contemplated by the contract. While s. 4 of the schedule referred to above indicated that the proposed company was to have the widest powers to enable it to carry out its undertaking and to take advantage of the various privileges and advantages which it was to receive from the Crown, it was perhaps considered advisable that it would be preferable to vest in the company the powers of a common law corporation restricted only in the matter defined by the contract and the schedule rather than to enumerate those powers which it was to be authorized to exercise. But this is mere speculation. If, therefore, assuming that the powers of the company are only those which it would have enjoyed had the incorporation been by a special Act of Parliament, the contract entered into by it with the city of Winnipeg was beyond its powers, it would be necessary to determine a second question, i.e., as to whether the railway company has all the powers of the natural person.\nBy its statement of claim, the railway company alleges that on or about September 5, 1881, an agreement was made between the company and the city granting to it the exemptions from taxation which are in issue in the present matter, the terms of which are stated to be set forth in certain by-laws of the city of Winnipeg. From the terms of the first of these by-laws, it is evident that there had been an agreement between the parties but, if it was reduced to writing, the document has not been produced. By-law No. 148 was adopted by the city on September 5, 1881, the date of the alleged agreement. After reciting that it was desirable that a line of railway should be built towards the westerly limit of the province of Manitoba through the Pembina Mountain district, for the purpose of developing traffic and trade between the city of Winnipeg and those portions of the province and:\nto secure the location of the work-shops and stockyards of the said company for the province of Manitoba in the city of Winnipeg as a central point on the main line of the Canadian Pacific and the several branches thereof, and the said company have agreed to construct a railway south and south-westerly, as aforesaid, at the time and in the manner as in this by-law hereinafter mentioned, and have agreed to establish and continue their \"principal workshops and stockyards for the province of Manitoba in the city of Winnipeg aforesaid.\"\nthe by-law authorized the council to issue debentures in the total sum of two hundred thousand dollars charged on the whole rateable property in the city of Winnipeg and to deliver them to the railway company on the performance by it of certain defined conditions. Of primary importance is condition 3, which provided as follows:\nThe said Canadian Pacific Railway Company shall immediately after the ratification of this by-law as aforesaid, make, execute and deliver to the mayor and council of the city of Winnipeg a bond and covenant under their corporate seal that the said company shall with all convenient and reasonable despatch, establish and build within the limits of the city of Winnipeg, their principal workshops for the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway within the province of Manitoba, and the branches thereof radiating from Winnipeg within the limits of the said province, and forever continue the same within the said city of Winnipeg.\nIn addition to providing for the delivery of the debentures, the by-law declared that:\nUpon the fulfilment by the said company of the conditions and stipulations herein mentioned by the said Canadian Pacific Railway Company, all property now owned or that hereafter may be owned by them within the limits of the city of Winnipeg, for railway purposes or in connection therewith, shall be forever free and exempt from all municipal taxes, rates and levies and assessments of every nature and kind.\nBy a by-law No. 195, adopted by the city on October 30, 1882, by-law No. 148 was amended and re-enacted and by c. 64 of the Statutes of Manitoba for 1883 assented to. On July 7 of that year the Act of Incorporation of the city was amended upon the petition of the mayor and council by declaring inter alia that these two by-laws were \"legal, binding and valid upon the said the mayor and council of the city of Winnipeg\". The learned trial judge has found as a fact that the railway company performed its various obligations referred to in the by-law in accordance with the terms of the agreement referred to: and that the city, on its part, discharged the obligations which it had assumed.\nThe first question to be determined is raised by the plea in the statement of defence of the city of Winnipeg that the railway company:\nhad no right, power or authority under its charter or otherwise, to make, or execute, or deliver such a bond and covenant,\nReferring to the bond and covenant required to be given by the company under condition 3 above referred to, and by a further plea that the railway company was without power under its charter or otherwise, to agree to build within the city of Winnipeg, or at any other place, its principal workshops for the main line of its railway within the province of Manitoba and to continue them forever. For the railway company, it is contended that the incorporation being by letters patent, under the Great Seal of Canada, it has all the powers of a natural person and that the doctrine of ultra vires does not apply to it and reliance is placed upon the judgment of the judicial committee in Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Co. v. The King 80. For the city, it is said that the powers of the city are those only which it would possess if incorporated by an Act of Parliament and that the principle stated in Ashbury Ry. Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche 81, applies.\nThe learned chief justice of the Court of King's Bench was of the opinion that the railway company had all of the powers of a common law corporation and in the Court of Appeal the Chief Justice of Manitoba and Coyne and Adamson JJ.A. agreed. The late Mr. Justice Richards considered that the company's powers were limited to those set forth in the Act authorizing its charter but that to enter into the agreement was within its powers. Dysart J.A. concluded that although the charter was in the form of a Royal Charter it was in substance a statutory one and the agreement ultra vires the company.\nIn the view I take of this matter, it is unnecessary to decide whether or not the Canadian Pacific Railway Company is vested with the powers of a common law corporation. I think that, if it be assumed for the purpose of argument that the powers of the company are simply those it would possess if the incorporation had been by statute and the terms of the letters patent contained in that statute, to enter into the bond and covenant was within those powers.\nBy the contract of October 21, 1880, which was approved and ratified by c. 1 of the statutes of 1881, the contractors assumed the vast obligation of building the major portion of the proposed railway through a country largely unsettled and following a route only generally defined and thereafter together with those portions of the proposed road to be constructed by the government, to:\nthereafter and forever efficiently maintain, work and run.\nthe railway. While certain of the terminal points of the line then in part under construction were to be preserved, the company was to have the right, subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, to lay out and locate the proposed line and advantage was taken of this provision by abandoning the proposed route running generally west-ward from Selkirk and establishing the main line of the railway on a line which included the city of Winnipeg and changing the route through the mountains from the Yellow Head to the Kicking Horse Pass. By s. 21 of the contract, the company to be incorporated was to have \"sufficient powers to enable them to carry out the foregoing contract\" and it was apparently realized that wide powers must be given to the proposed company to enable it to advantageously carry out its terms. It was, in my opinion, for this reason that s. 4 of Schedule A to the contract was expressed in such wide language. It is clear that when the contract was signed, that the proposed incorporation was to be by an Act of Parliament which, I think, explains the very broad powers described in para. 4. It would have been quite unnecessary to particularize these powers in this manner had it been contemplated in 1880 that the incorporation should be by letters patent under the Great Seal, without any restriction upon the powers which such an incorporation would have vested in the company. Whatever the reasons which led to the grant of letters patent and whether or not it was intended by that Act to vest in the company the powers of a common law corporation, para 4 of schedule A was incorporated verbatim in the letters patent. Thus, there was conferred upon the company by s. 4 of the letters patent all the powers necessary or useful to enable it to discharge its obligations under the contract. It was, in my opinion, for the railway company to determine the location of its principal workshops for the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway within Manitoba and the branches radiating from Winnipeg and that these workshops should be continued in such location as it should determine and to conclude as favourable a bargain as could be negotiated with the city or municipality where these were to be located. By the Fall of 1881 the directors of the company had evidently reached the conclusion that Winnipeg, by virtue of its location, was to be the principal city in the province of Manitoba and, thus, the most suitable place from which branch lines such as the line running south to Morris and westerly through the Pembina Mountains areas, should have their eastern terminus. The company was not asked by the city in exchange for the promised tax exemption and the grant of the debentures to maintain its only railway workshops for the main line in Manitoba in Winnipeg, but merely the principal workshops: others might be constructed elsewhere in the province. The further obligation was to erect large and commodious stock and cattle yards suitable and appropriate for the central business of the main line and the several branches as mentioned in section 3 of the by-law, language which was incorporated in the covenant rather than that of paragraph 2 of the preamble to the by-law which referred to the \"principal workshops and stockyards.\" The power of the company to agree to build a general passenger depot upon a designated site in the city is not, of course, questioned.\nThe comment of Lord Selborne L.C., on the decision of the House of Lords in Ashbury Railway Co. v. Riche, supra, in Attorney General v. Great Eastern Railway Co. 82, is that the doctrine of ultra vires as explained in the earlier case is to be maintained but that it should be reasonably understood and applied and that whatever may fairly be regarded as incidental to or consequential upon those things which the legislature has authorized ought not, unless expressly prohibited, be held by judicial construction to be ultra vires. There is nothing in the letters patent or in the Act of 1881 which prohibited the railway company from entering into such a covenant as the one here in question. It was, in the language of s. 4, undoubtedly \"useful\" to the company to enable it to carry out its contract to construct the railway and thereafter to operate it in perpetuity to give such a covenant, in order to obtain such extensive financial assistance and exemption from municipal taxation. In my opinion, the contention that it was beyond the powers of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. to enter into the bond and covenant, fails.\nAs a further defence to the action, the defendant pleads that it had no right, power or authority under its charter or otherwise, to pass by-laws Nos. 148 or 195. The original charter of incorporation of the defendant is contained in c. 7 of the statutes of 1873 and thereby the inhabitants of the city and their successors were declared to be:\nA body (politic and corporate in fact and in law by the name of \"The Mayor and Council of the city of Winnipeg\" and separated from the county of Selkirk for all municipal purposes.\nIt was by this name that the corporation was described in the consolidated charter of the city in c. 36 of the statutes of 1882. The language of s. 6 of c. 64 of the statutes of 1883, in so far as it affects the present matter, reads:\nThat * * * by-law No. 148 to authorize the issue of debentures granting by way of bonus to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company the sum of $200,000 in consideration of certain undertakings on the part of the said company; and by-law 195 amending by-law No. 148 and extending the time for the completion of the undertakings expressed in by-law No. 148 by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, and all debentures and coupons for interest issued under each and every of the said by-laws, be and the same are hereby declared legal, binding and valid upon the said mayor and council of the city of Winnipeg.\nWithout considering the question as to whether the corporation had the power to agree to the tax exemption and the granting of the bonus under its existing powers, it is clear that it was intended to validate the by-laws and declare that the obligations on the part of the city referred to in them were binding upon it. To otherwise construe the section would be, in my opinion, to defeat the intention of the legislature. S. 14 of the Interpretation Act (c. 105, R.S.M. 1940) declares that:\nEvery Act and every regulation and every provision thereof shall be deemed remedial and shall receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as best insures the attainment of the object of the Act, regulation or provision.\nThe object of the amendment was to set at rest any doubts as to the power of the corporation to obligate itself in the manner described in the by-laws and the section must, in my opinion, be so construed.\nThe bond and covenant of the railway company, dated October 10, 1881, delivered in pursuance of the agreement recited in the city by-laws, after referring in a recital to the agreement of the city to grant aid to the company to the extent of $200,000 by the issue of debentures and by exempting the property of the company from certain taxation, obligated the company to:\nestablish and build within the limits of the said city of Winnipeg their principal workshops for their main line of railway within the province of Manitoba and for the branches thereof, radiating from the said city of Winnipeg within the limits of the said province and that they will forever continue the same within the said city of Winnipeg.\nAt the time this instrument was made, the area contained within the limits of the city of Winnipeg were those defined by c. 7 of the statutes of Manitoba for 1873 and an extension provided by c. 38 of the statutes of 1875, and it was within this area that the workshops erected in pursuance of the covenant were placed. Thereafter, on various occasions, the limits of the city were extended: large areas were added by c. 45 of the statutes of 1882 and these limits were further extended in the years 1902, 1906 and 1907. In the year 1903, the railway company removed the workshops from the original site to a point further west within the area added in 1882 where they have since been maintained. By an amendment to its statement of defence, the city alleges that the railway company is not entitled to the exemptions from taxation claimed, since it did not fulfill the conditions mentioned in by-law No. 148 in that about the year 1903, the company built their principal workshops or a substantial part thereof, outside the limits of the city of Winnipeg as defined and constituted in the year 1881. The recitals in the by-law declared inter alia that it was desirable to secure the location of the workshops and stockyards of the company for the province of Manitoba in the city of Winnipeg as a central point on the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway and the several branches thereof and that the company had agreed to establish and continue its principal workshops and stockyards for the province in the city. \"Desirable\" meant desirable in the interest of the municipal entity known as the city of Winnipeg and of its inhabitants. The purpose of those negotiating on behalf of the municipal corporation was to ensure in its interest and in the interest of its present and future inhabitants that these activities of the railway company, with the manifest benefits which would result, should be continued for all time in Winnipeg. They did not seek the benefit merely for the then residents of the city living within its existing limits, but also for those who would thereafter live within the limits of the corporation from time to time and the corporation whatever might be its limits. They did not stipulate the place within the corporate limits where the workshops should be placed which was apparently not regarded as a matter of moment: they sought to ensure simply that they should be constructed and maintained and operated within the limits of the corporation as they might be from time to time. The purpose of the railway company which had obligated itself by its contract with the government to operate the railway line in perpetuity was to obtain, not only immediate financial help, but exemption from municipal taxes for all time.\nIn River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson 83, Lord Blackburn stating the principle to be applied in the construction of the language of instruments in writing, said in part:\nIn all cases, the object is to see what is the intention expressed by the words used. But, from the imperfection of language, it is impossible to know what that intention is without inquiring farther, and seeing what the circumstances were with reference to which the words were used, and what was the object, appearing from those circumstances, which the person using them had in view; for the meaning of words varies according to the circumstances with respect to which they were used.\nThe question is what is the meaning of the words \"within the said city of Winnipeg\" as used in this covenant and it is permissible, in my opinion, to consider the language of the by-law in pursuance of which it was given as an aid to construction. Once the object of both parties is ascertained, it seems to me that the meaning is made perfectly clear. Without resorting to other aids to interpretation, it is my opinion that the obligation was to continue the workshops within the limits of the city of Winnipeg as they might be from time to time.\nAssuming that there is doubt as to the meaning to be assigned to these words, the subsequent conduct of the parties may be examined to resolve the ambiguity and to do this in the present matter makes certain what both parties intended by the language employed. The workshops were built within the limits of the City of Winnipeg as defined by the city charter as it read in the year 1881, but in the following year, those limits were largely extended. The railway company owned properties within the new areas added to the city in 1882. Presumably, if effect is to be given to the argument of the city on this aspect of the matter, the expression \"the city of Winnipeg\" in s. S of by-law No. 148 which declared the right to the tax exemption, should be construed in the same manner as those words in s. 3 and of the covenant given in pursuance of the terms of the latter section. However, it is admitted that none of these lands either in the original or in the added area were subjected to municipal taxation between the years 1882 and 1900 except that in 1894 the city sought to levy school taxes upon the railway company's property and brought an action to recover them, which failed. Between the years 1900 and 1947, the city was prohibited by the terms of the Railway Taxation Act (63 and 64 Vict. c. 57) from taxing the property of the company. Apart from any question as to the effect the judgment in this action may have upon the present proceedings by rendering issues here sought to be raised res judicata, it is of importance to note, as relating to the subsequent conduct of the parties, that in that action (City of Winnipeg v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.) 84, which was decided upon a demurrer, the question litigated was as to whether school taxes were within the class of taxes for which exemption had been promised, and it was not then contended by the city that that exemption was in any event limited to lands owned by the railway company for railway purposes within the limits of the city of Winnipeg as they existed in 1881. It is perhaps further worthy of note that the claim that the railway company had lost its right to any tax exemption provided by the by-law by virtue of the fact that in 1903 it had established its principal workshops or a substantial part thereof outside the limits of the city of Winnipeg as defined and constituted in the year 1881 was first raised by an amendment to the statement of defence made some months after the original defence, some thirty-five paragraphs in length, had been filed. This suggests that this point had not occured to the city or any of its legal representatives until after the original statement of defence was filed.\nIn the view that I take of this matter it is unnecessary to deal with the question as to whether the power of the city to enter into the agreement is res judicata by reason of the litigation between the parties commenced in the year 1894 above referred to (12 M.R. 581; 30 S.C.R. 561).\nThe question as to whether business taxes are within the exemption provided for by the by-law is, in my opinion, concluded in favour of the appellant by our decision in Canadian Pacific Ry. v. Attorney General of Saskatchewan 85.\nThere remains the question as to whether the Royal Alexandra Hotel property falls within the exemption. The promised exemption was of all property then owned or which might thereafter be owned by the railway company within the limits of the city of Winnipeg:\n\"for railway purposes or in connection therewith\".\nThe Royal Alexandra Hotel is built on railway property at the corner of Higgins avenue and Main street, in the city of Winnipeg, and is physically connected with the railway station. Part of the station building itself is used by the Royal Alexandra Hotel as a coffee shop which provides meals to the travelling public and railway employees. The hotel was originally constructed in 1906 and considerably enlarged in the year 1914. According to Mr. William Manson, vice-president of the prairie region of the railway company, the railway uses the hotel services of this hotel extensively. All linen from the sleeping and dining cars is laundered in the hotel laundries. Accommodation is furnished to extra sleeping and dining car conductors and dining car crews during periods of heavy traffic, meals are provided to these employees and some railway conferences and staff meetings are held there. In the same manner as the other hotels operated by the railway company in Toronto, Regina, Calgary and elsewhere, the Royal Alexandra Hotel provides food and lodging for the travelling public. Speaking generally of all the railway company's hotels, Mr. Manson said that they have been established for the traffic that they would draw to the railway and that it its considered essential to proper railway service to have an adequate hotel system. The Royal Alexandra, however, does not restrict its activities to those above described but is used by the general public, irrespective of whether they are making use of the railway's other facilities: balls and entertainments are held there and other public functions.\nThe question is simply one of construction of the language of the by-law. While the hotel is clearly not used exclusively for railway purposes or in connection therewith, to\n[page 491]\nthe extent that it furnishes lodging and meals to persons other than those travelling on the railway and its facilities are used for functions unrelated to any railway activity, I do not think this affects the matter to be decided. The railway company was, at the time the by-law was passed, empowered by s. 4 of its letters patent to carry on such activities as might be useful to it to enable it to carry out its obligations under the contract. The evidence of the witness Manson is not contradicted. The operation of railway hotels, where the station and the hotel are incorporated in one building, is commonplace in England and has been for a very long time. I think s. 4 of the charter empowered the railway company to maintain and operate hotels in connection with their railway activities if it was considered that this would assist the development of its railway properties and the discharge of its obligation to operate the Canadian Pacific Railway in perpetuity. The language of the by-law is not that the properties exempted were those then or which might thereafter be owned exclusively for railway purposes or in connection therewith, and I think the language should not be construed in a manner so restricting it.\nIt has been contended in argument that the decision of the judicial committee in Canadian Pacific Ry. v. Attorney General for British Columbia 86, affects the matter, but I think that this is not so. The issue in that litigation was as to whether the hours of work of the employees of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, owned and operated by the present appellant, were regulated by The Hours of Work Act of British Columbia. Three questions were considered on the appeal: the first of these was raised by the contention that the Empress Hotel being an integral part of the railway system of the company and its activities having become such an extensive and important element in the national economy of Canada, the regulation of its activities did not come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes or subjects assigned by s. 92 exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces, so that parliament was entitled under the general powers conferred by the first part of s. 91 to regulate its affairs; the second was as to whether the hotel was part of the appellant's railway works and undertaking connecting the province of British Columbia with other provinces and thus within the exception contained in head 10(a) of s. 92; the third was as to whether the hotel, as part of the company's railway system, fell within head 10(c) of s. 92 as a work which had been declared by parliament to be for the general advantage of Canada or of two or more of its provinces. All of these questions were decided contray to the contentions of the railway company. None of them appear to me to bear upon the present matter which, as I have said, is simply one of the construction of the particular language of the by-law.\nFor these reasons, I think the Royal Alexandra Hotel property is entitled to the exemption provided for by the by-law and which is enjoyed by other properties of the company within the present limits of the city of Winnipeg owned for railway purposes or in connection therewith.\nThe appeal of the railway company should be allowed with costs and that of the respondent city dismissed with costs; the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be set aside and that of the learned trial judge restored. The appellant should have its costs in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. allowed, judgment of Court of Appeal set aside and that of trial judge restored with costs here and in the Court of Appeal.

Findlay, [1952] 1 S.C.R. 96\nDate: 1951-10-02\nDonald M. Findlay (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nMary Findlay (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1951: May 30; 1951: October 2.\nPresent: Kerwin, Rand, Kellock, Locke and Cartwright JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nHusband and Wife\u2014Separation Agreement\u2014Repudiation of payments by husband\u2014Application for maintenance under The Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 211, dismissed as to wife\u2014Effect on action by wife to recover arrears under separation agreement.\nUnder a separation agreement a husband covenanted to pay a monthly sum for his wife\u2019s support and a further sum for the support of their child. After several payments had been made the wife wrote the husband demanding an increase. The husband treated the demand as a repudiation of the agreement and ceased paying. Alleging desertion the wife brought action under The Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act. The claim was dismissed as to the wife but maintained as to the child. The wife then sued to recover the amounts in arrear under the agreement and secured judgment. The husband appealed on the grounds that: the wife had repudiated the agreement and elected for recourse under the Act; was thereby estopped from asserting any claim she might have had under the agreement, and finally that the judgment obtained under the Act was res judicata.\nHeld: (Cartwright J. dissenting). The appeal should be dismissed. The doctrine of election had no application and there was no basis for the defence of estoppel or res ajudicata. (Kerwin J. concurred in the finding of the trial judge, affirmed by the Court of Appeal, that the correspondence did not effect a repudiation by the respondent or a termination by mutual agreement of the provisions of the separation agreement.)\nPer Rand J. The rights under the agreement and statute are based on different considerations: they remain co-existent but, related to a period of time, the performance of only one can be exacted, and the operation of one and suspension of the other will depend on the circumstances. Election can not be taken as between the statutory right and the agreement as a whole. The purpose of the statute is to give the wife a summary means of compelling the husband to support her: it is not to cut down rights against him which she otherwise possesses. To bring an action under the agreement can not affect the right under the statute.\nPer Kellock and Locke JJ. The respondent on the facts of the case, did not have any cause of action under the Act and therefore was not in fact faced with an election at all. Where the parties are living apart by consent when the refusal or neglect occurs, it cannot be said of the wife that she is living apart \u201cbecause of\u201d such refusal or neglect. Per Cartwright J., dissenting, The default by the husband in the circumstances amounted in law to a repudiation. The wife had a choice of remedies, to sue on the contract, or to treat it as at an end. If she chose the latter the contract would no longer be in existence. Lush on Husband and Wife 4 ed. p. 385. Having sought payment under the statute and not by virtue of the contract, she made her election. Cooper v. C.N.O.R. 55 O.L.R. 256 at 260; Scarf v. Jardine 7 App. Cas. 345 at 360.\nDecision of the Court of Appeal [1951] 1 D.L.R. 185, affirmed.\nAPPEAL by a husband from the judgment of the Court of Appeal[1] affirming the judgment of Gale J.[2] in favour of a wife in an action to recover arrears under a separation agreement.\nR.M.W. Chitty K.C. for the appellant: The Court of Appeal erred in the following respects (i) the facts show that the respondent unequivocally repudiated the contract and therefore the cause of action disappeared; (ii) having elected the remedy of recourse to the Courts, she elected to rely on her rights under the statute and abandoned the contract; (iii) she is estopped from setting up the contract; (iv) the order of the Family Court is res judicata.\nThe agreement not being in arrears the respondent was precluded from a resort to the Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act. She might have had an action in alimony. Hyman v. Hyman[3]. The appellant could have continued to make payments under the agreement and thus barred the action taken by the respondent under the statute but he chose, as he had the right to do, to accept a repudiation: Hochster v. De la Tour[4]; Scarf v. Jardine[5]; Cooper v. C.N.O.R.[6]; Toronto Ry. Co. v. Hutton[7]; Bouveur v. Bouveur[8]; Wagner v. Wagner[9]; Wiley v. Wiley[10]; Tulip v. Tulip[11]\nThe principle of estoppel is essentially involved in the argument already submitted. Election is a branch of estoppel, 13 Hals. 2nd Ed. pp. 454-5.\nThe information in the Family Court was clearly laid under s. (1) of The Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act. That section permits a deserted wife to claim maintenance for herself and children of the marriage living with her. It does not involve any adjudication that the children are \u201cdeserted.\u201d The magistrate\u2019s order purports to dismiss the application as to the wife but orders maintenance for the child living with her. The order as to the child must depend upon a finding that the wife was deserted and the purported dismissal as to the wife can only mean that the wife while \u201cdeserted\u201d, to give jurisdiction to make the order, is not entitled to maintenance.\nThere is thus a valid and subsisting order of a Court of competent jurisdiction adjudicating the rights of the parties. The appellant was at no time charged with desertion of his child and so until and unless the information was amended so to charge him the magistrate had no jurisdiction to make an order under s. 2. The order can only have been made under s. 1 and the dismissal as to the wife can only mean that under the circumstances and on the evidence the wife was not entitled to an award of maintenance for herself but only for the child. In Stevens v. Stevens[12], the Court of Appeal for Ontario held in that case, as McTague J.A. delivering the judgment said, \u201cIt is unnecessary to decide whether the order of the Domestic Relations Court abrogates the agreement, but I take the view that the operation of the separation agreement is under suspension as long as the order is outstanding.\u201d His obiter dictum does not go far enough but assuming it is an accurate statement of the law, so far as it goes, the respondent here is barred by it from enforcing the agreement because there is an order of the Family Court subsisting that at least suspends the remedy under the separation agreement. The separation agreement is no more severable in this manner than the order of the Family Court.\nMoyer v. Moyer[13] is clearly distinguishable\u2014there the order of the Family Court had expired and was not a subsisting order. Smellie v. Smellie[14] is also distinguishable. No question of contractual rights arose. The conflict was between rights under The Matrimonial Causes Act and The Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act. W.D.S. Morden, for the respondent: There was no evidence adduced to support the allegation that the respondent deserted the appellant. Assuming that she had, such desertion could not affect the validity of the separation agreement entered into more than a month after the alleged desertion.\nThe separation agreement was not brought about by duress. A contract is voidable at the option of one of the parties if he entered into it under duress, but he must make his choice to deny or affirm the contract within a reasonable time. In this case the appellant acted on the separation agreement for nine months and as a consequence cannot now be heard to complain of circumstances leading up to the making of the agreement. United Shoe Machinery Co. v. Brunet[15]; Bowlf Grain Co. v. Ross[16]; Abram S.S. Co. v. Westville Shipping Co.[17]; McKinnon v. Doran.[18]\nThe separation agreement was not terminated by mutual consent. Mere negotiation for a variation of the terms of a contract will not amount to a waiver unless the circumstances show that it was the intention of the parties that there should be an absolute abandonment and dissolution of the contract, Robinson v. Page[19]. Where the question is whether one party is set free by the action of the other, the real matter for consideration is whether the acts or conduct of the one do or do not amount to an intimation of an intention to abandon the contract and altogether to refuse performance. Frult v. Burr[20]; General Billposting Co. v. Atkinson.[21]\nThe learned trial judge was right in holding that there is nothing in The Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act which expressly extinguishes the respondent\u2019s right of action under the separation agreement. No statute operates to repeal or modify the existing law, whether common or statutory, unless the intention is clearly implied. Lamontagne v. Quebec Ry. L.H. & P. Co.[22]; Western Cos. Ry. Co. v. Windsor & Annapolis Ry.[23] The respondent retains a right to sue for default under the separation agreement despite the proceedings taken by her in the Family Court. Had that Court made an order in her favour, the provisions in the separation agreement would be suspended as long as the order was outstanding. Steevens v. Steevens[24]; Moyer v. Moyer[25]; Smellie v. Smellie[26].\nChitty K.C. replied.\nKERWIN J.:\u2014This Court granted leave to the defendant, Donald M. Findlay, to appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[27] dismissing an appeal by him from the order of Gale J. which adjudged that the plaintiff, Mary L. Findlay, the wife of the defendant, do recover against him fifty-five dollars with costs on the Division Court scale without set-off, and further ordered that the defendant\u2019s counter-claim be dismissed with costs to the plaintiff on the Supreme Court scale. Several of the issues raised before the trial judge and the Court of Appeal were abandoned in this Court, leaving for consideration only the questions designated by counsel for the appellant as repudiation, election, estoppel and res judicata.\nBy an agreement of September 16, 1948, the parties separated and agreed that the husband should have the custody and control of a son of the marriage and that the wife should have the custody and control of a daughter. The husband agreed to pay the wife $30 each month for herself, down to and including the month of January, 1950, after which the monthly payment was to be increased to $40. He also agreed to pay the wife $35 per month for the daughter\u2019s maintenance. On May 31 the respondent wrote the appellant a letter to which no reply was made until June 29, and it in turn was answered on July 4. At that time no default had been made in any of the payments under the agreement.\nThe trial judge considered this correspondence and his conclusion that it did not effect a repudiation by the respondent or a termination by mutual agreement, of the provisions of the separation agreement, was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. Without detailing the contents of these letters, it is sufficient to say that having read them and considered the argument on behalf of the appellant, I am in agreement with that conclusion.\nThe issues as to election, estoppel and res judicata may be considered together but it is first necessary to narrate what occurred after the correspondence referred to above. Under The Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 211, as amended, an information was laid by the respondent against the appellant charging that he had deserted his wife without having made adequate provision for her maintenance and the maintenance of any of his children residing with her, and that he was able to maintain them in whole or part, and that he wilfully neglected or refused so to do. The record shows that after a plea of not guilty, the order made upon that information was as follows:\u2014\nDismissed as to wife. Order for $10 per week for support of child, first payment to be made July 26, 1949, at the York County Family Court office.\nThe appellant was paid the $10 each week for the daughter. On October 12, 1949, the respondent brought an action against the appellant in the First Division Court of the County of York, claiming the sum of $120 as arrears of payments due her under the separation agreement. On the appellant\u2019s application this action was transferred into the Supreme Court of Ontario and came on for trial before Gale J. Presumably something had been paid on account of the $120, leaving a balance of $55, for which amount judgment was given.\nIn Stevens v. Stevens[28], the wife took proceedings under the Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act and was granted an order for payments which were less in amount than those to which she was entitled under a separation agreement. She then commenced proceedings in the Division Court for a sum representing the difference between the total of the payments due under the separation agreement and those made under the Act. It was held that she had alternative and not cumulative remedies, and McTague J.A., in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, states:\u2014\nIt is unnecessary to decide whether the order of the Domestic Relations Court abrogates the agreement, but I take the view that the operation of the separation agreement is under suspension as long as the order is outstanding.\nIn Moyer v. Moyer[29], the plaintiff had made an application under the Act and an order was granted directing the husband to pay the wife certain amounts \u201cfor a period of six months with the opportunity to either party to speak to this Court\u201d at the expiration of that time. After the expiration of six months within which no further steps were taken in those proceedings, an action was commenced in the Supreme Court of Ontario for alimony, and Hogg J. held, following Stevens v. Stevens, that her rights were under suspension, but only so long as the order was outstanding. The Stevens case was also referred to in Smellie v. Smellie and Murphy[30]. That was a motion in an action for divorce for an order for payment of maintenance for the infant children of the parties. It was held that it was undesirable where the relief asked is within the competence of the lower Court that an order should be made in the Supreme Court of Ontario as long as there is outstanding in the Magistrate\u2019s Court an order for the same purpose.\nIn the meantime, in Saskatchewan, MacDonald J. in Bouveur v. Bouveur[31], had extended the decision in Stevens and proceeding upon a suggested analogy with decisions under the British and Saskatchewan Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts held that the granting of an order under the Saskatchewan Act and compliance with it by the husband, although the order was subsequently rescinded on the latter\u2019s application, estopped the wife from relying upon the provisions of a separation agreement. He referred to the decision of Elwood J. in Dalrymple v. C.P.R.[32], and the Court of Appeal in Neale v. Electric and Ordnance Accessories Co.[33]. It remains but to add that Bouveur v. Bouveur was distinguished by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in an opinion delivered on its behalf by Mr. Justice MacDonald in Wagner v. Wagner[34], where it was held that the fact that an action for alimony has been commenced and later discontinued by a wife does not constitute a bar to her subsequent enforcement of her right to the payment of maintenance under The Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act, R.S.S. 1940, c. 234.\nOn this appeal it is unnecessary to consider a situation such as existed in Stevens v. Stevens. The suggested analogy with decisions under Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts is not valid as that class of legislation contains special provisions differing in various jurisdictions as to the right to claim compensation if an action be dismissed, and also amendments have from time to time been made conferring a right, in England at any rate, upon the Court of Appeal to fix the compensation or refer the matter back for that purpose if the action and an appeal from its dismissal have been dismissed. I deem it unsafe to apply any decisions under such Acts to circumstances such as here exist.\nThe doctrine of election, or as it is called in the law of Scotland, the doctrine of \u201capprobation\u201d and \u201creprobation\u201d, depends upon intention: Spread v. Morgan[35]. The doctrine was fully discussed in Lissenden v. C.A.V. Bosch Limited[36], and particularly in the judgment of Viscount Maugham. He points out it was confined in England and in Scotland to cases arising under wills and deeds and other instruments inter vivos until the decision of the Court of Appeal in Johnson v. Newton Fire Extinguisher Co.[37]. That decision and others following it were overruled in Lissenden and it was held that the doctrine could not apply to the right of a litigant to appeal either from a judgment or from an award of a County Court judge made under the British Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 1925, where the litigant had accepted weekly sums payable under an award, and it was decided that he was not precluded from appealing on the ground that the compensation should have been of a larger sum than that awarded. At page 419, after stating as one of the general propositions not in doubt that no person is taken to have made an election until he has had an opportunity of ascertaining his rights and is aware of their nature and extent, Viscount Maugham continues:\u2014\u201cElection in other words, being an equitable doctrine, is a question of intention based on knowledge.\u201d At page 429, Lord Atkin states:\u2014\u201dWhere the doctrine does apply, if the person to whom the choice belongs irrevocably and with knowledge adopts the one, he cannot afterwards assert the other.\u201d Lord Russell of Killowen agreed with Viscount Maugham and Lord Atkin. At page 436, Lord Wright states:\u2014\u201cEven if this were (which it is not) a case of election, there is, furthermore, no evidence of the essential elements of election, namely, the presence of knowledge of the position and intention to elect.\u201d\nI am unable to perceive upon what grounds it may be said that merely by laying the information the respondent intended to forego any rights she had under the separation agreement. Indeed it is plain that nothing was farther from her mind. The doctrine of election has, therefore, no application. As to estoppel, no step was taken by the appellant in reliance upon any action of the respondent and there is no basis for that defence or the defence of res judicata as all that transpired before the magistrate was that the respondent\u2019s claim under the Act for maintenance for herself was dismissed. The magistrate had no jurisdiction to enforce the separation agreement although, under subsection 2 of section 1, the existence of such an agreement, providing there has been default thereunder, does not prevent the exercise of jurisdiction to order payments.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRAND J.:\u2014This action was brought by a wife on a separation agreement made in September, 1948, for monthly payments as provided. Several defences were raised: that the contract had been obtained by duress: that a repudiation by the wife had been accepted by the husband: that it had been terminated by agreement: and that the action was barred by reason of certain proceedings brought in the York County Family Court under The Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act. The first three were found against the husband in both courts below and those findings have not been seriously challenged in this Court. The last presents the substantial point in the appeal. After an exchange of letters in May and June, 1949, on which the defence of repudiation was based, the husband, here the appellant, defaulted in the monthly payments both to the wife for herself and for the maintenance of a young daughter living with her. The wife thereupon laid an information under the Act mentioned both on her own behalf and on behalf of the child, alleging desertion and claiming maintenance. The Family Court, treating the relief sought as severable, dismissed the wife\u2019s personal claim on the ground that no evidence of desertion within section 1(2) of the Act, the condition of relief, had been presented; and made an order in favour of the wife for the benefit of the child of $10 a week. By the agreement the sum for the wife was $30 a month and for the daughter, $35. Following the dismissal of the wife\u2019s complaint, this action was brought.\nThe argument is put on several grounds: election, estoppel and res judicata; but before dealing with them, it will be desirable to refer to the relevant provisions of the statute.\nS. 1(1):\u2014\nWhere a wife has been deserted by her husband an information may be laid before a justice of the peace and such justice of the peace may issue a summons against the husband in accordance with the form in the Schedule to this Act and if upon the hearing before a magistrate, it appears that the husband has deserted his wife without having made adequate provision for her maintenance and the maintenance of his children residing with her and that he is able to maintain them in whole or in part and neglects or refuses so to do, the magistrate may order him to pay such weekly sum as may be deemed proper, having regard to all the circumstances and such order may be in the form given in the Schedule to this Act.\n(2) A married woman shall be deemed to have been deserted within the meaning of this section when she is living apart from her husband because of his acts of cruelty, or of his refusal or neglect, without sufficient cause, to supply her with food and other necessaries when able so to do, or of the husband having been guilty of adultery which has not been condoned and which is duly proved, notwithstanding the existence of a separation agreement, providing there has been default thereunder and whether or not the separation agreement contains express provisions excluding the operations of this Act.\nSection 2(2):\u2014\nA child shall be deemed to have been deserted by his father, within the meaning of this section, when the child is under the age of sixteen years and when the father has, without adequate cause, refused or neglected to supply such child with food or other necessaries when able so to do. What is the \u201cdefault\u201d under p. 1(2) that will open the statutory relief to the wife? If the agreement does not provide for maintenance, is the wife forever barred, providing no default takes place? Assuming default to be in payment of maintenance and that only agreements containing such a provision are within the subsection, the statute is to be taken as creating, as a matter of public policy, a right in the wife to which resort may not be made so long as a provision for maintenance in a separation agreement is being fulfilled.\nBut it is patent that the right under the agreement and that under the statute are based on different matters and factors: the former could be resisted only by considerations arising out of the agreement: but that under the statute involves desertion and the conditions laid down in s. 1. They are thus separate and distinct in substance, character and remedy. It is not, then, a matter of alternative claims arising out of the same state of facts. The jural conclusion from that situation is this: the rights remain coexistent but, related to a period of time, the performance of only one of them can be exacted; and the operation of one and the suspension of the other will depend on the circumstances. Election could not be taken to be between the statutory right and the agreement as a whole: the latter will in general provide for essential matters which are quite beyond the purview of the statute; and if resort to the statute were to abrogate the provision in the agreement for maintenance, it would effect a basic alteration in the considerations on which the mutual promises were made. It might conceivably lead as well to the defeat of the statutory claim through the removal, by the husband, of the grounds on which it rests. The purpose of the statute is to give to the wife a summary means of compelling the husband to support her: it is not to cut down rights against him which she otherwise possesses. Where such relief is, in the public interest, provided for the protection of the wife, why should it be so interpreted as to create substantial risks in resorting to it? In the presence of such disparate and independent claims, each depending on different facts, a rule that the commencement of proceedings on one is an irrevocable election to be bound by its result, putting both on the issue of one, seems to me to lack a sound legal basis. Election, moreover, implies a plurality of real rights: if an asserted claim is rejected, it cannot be the matter of election. The order of the Family Court did reject the claim under the statute and there was left only the right, if it existed, under the agreement. Furthermore, to bring action on the agreement would not affect the right under the statute; if that were not so, the husband, by deliberate default, could effectually force the wife to the loss of one or other of the remedies; but the statute cannot be taken to intend as a further condition of its availability, that the wife should abandon her remedy under the agreement, an unsatisfied judgment on which would appear clearly to be such a default as s. 1(2) envisages. As election must operate reciprocally, a fortiori the right under the agreement is not lost by a futile resort to the statute.\nNor can I see any possible application of estoppel. In whatever mode it is conceived, as representation of fact, existing or future, or as a mutual assumption of a situation acted upon, it lacks a basis in actuality. The letters between the parties exhibit the defects of the contention; if estoppel could be tortured out of them, that device would become an almost universal determinant of rights.\nFinally it is urged that the order by the Family Court is res judicata. The issue to be determined there was that of desertion and it was found against the wife: but desertion is no part of the claim under the agreement. And as the order in relation to the child was clearly made under s. 2, this ground is without any substance.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Kellock and Locke JJ. was delivered by:\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming a judgment at trial in favour of the respondent in an action brought by her to recover certain past due instalments under a separation agreement between the parties. Under the agreement in question, dated September 16, 1948, the appellant covenanted to pay to the respondent during the joint lives of the parties an \u201callowance\u201d of $30 per month and to pay for the maintenance of their infant daughter, whose custody was to be in the wife, the sum of $35 per month until the child attained the age of 18 years. At the present time, the child is eleven.\nThe payments called for by the agreement were duly made until and including the month of June, 1949, when, as result of certain correspondence passing between the parties, initiated by the respondent, the appellant refused to make further payments. Thereafter, the respondent commenced proceedings under The Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 211. These proceedings were dismissed as to the respondent herself but an order was made against the appellant for the payment of $10 per week for the support of the infant daughter, the payments to be paid into the Family Court of York County.\nThe appellant contends that the action ought to have been dismissed at the trial on the ground that the respondent, in the correspondence passing between the parties prior to the litigation, had repudiated the separation agreement and that this repudiation was accepted by him. He further contends that, on the basis of election or estoppel, by reason of the proceedings taken by the respondent above referred to, she is no longer entitled to enforce the covenant for payment in the deed of separation.\nThe statute, by subsection (1) of s. 1, provides that where a husband has deserted his wife without having made adequate provision for her maintenance and the maintenance of his children residing with her, and (that) he is able to maintain them in whole or in part and neglects or refuses so to do, he may be ordered to pay such weekly sum as may be deemed proper, having regard to all the circumstances. It is further provided by subsection (2) that a married woman shall be deemed to have been deserted within the meaning of the section when she is living apart from her husband because of, inter alia, his refusal or neglect without cause to supply her with food and other necessaries when able so to do, \u201cnotwithstanding the existence of a separation agreement, providing there has been default thereunder, and whether or not the separation agreement contains express provisions excluding the operation of this Act.\u201d The words quoted were added by amendment in 1935. Subsection (1) of s. 2 provides that a father who has deserted his child may be summoned before a magistrate or judge of the Juvenile Court, who, if satisfied that the former has wilfully refused or neglected to maintain the child and has deserted the child, may order the father to pay up to $20 per week for its support, as the magistrate or judge may consider proper, having regard to the means of the father and to any means the child may have for his support. Subsection (2) provides that a child shall be deemed to have been deserted by the father within the meaning of the section when the child is under the age of 16 years and the father has, without adequate cause, refused or neglected to supply such child with food or other necessaries when able so to do.\nWith respect to the correspondence, I am content to take the view that the respondent was announcing her intention not to be bound by the agreement with respect to the amount thereby provided for and, if necessary, of instituting proceedings to obtain increased maintenance. What the basis of this demand was the correspondence does not say. The appellant purported to accept this renunciation of the payments called for by the agreement, but coupled therewith an assertion of his intention of insisting otherwise upon the deed, including the provision as to living separate from the respondent.\nIt will be convenient, first, to deal with the defence founded upon election. It is, of course, for the appellant, with respect to this defence as with respect to the others, to make out his case. He contends that the respondent had a choice as between her rights under the agreement and a claim under the statute, and having chosen the latter she has lost the former.\nAppellant cites the following from the judgment of Lord Blackburn in Scarf v. Jardine[38]:\u2014\nThe principle, I take it, running through all the cases as to what is an election is this, that where a party in his own mind has thought that he would choose one of two remedies, even though he has written it down on a memorandum or has indicated it in some other way, that alone will not bind him; but so soon as he has not only determined to follow one of his remedies but has communicated it to the other side in such a way as to lead the opposite party to believe that he has made that choice, he has completed his election and can go no further; and whether he intended it or not, if he has done an unequivocal act\u2014I mean an act which would be justifiable if he had elected one way and would not be justifiable if he had elected the other way\u2014the fact of his having done that unequivocal act to the knowledge of the persons concerned is an election.\nIn this judgment Lord Blackburn, as pointed out by Lord Atkin in United Australia v. Barclays Bank[39], is dealing not with alternative remedies but with the case of a person who is presented with two inconsistent rights, and the important thing to observe for present purposes is that in order that a plaintiff becomes disentitled to a right by electing to enforce another, he must, to begin with, have actually had a choice of two rights. This underlies the judgments of all of their Lordships.\nIn the course of his judgment in the United Australia case, (supra), Lord Atkin said at p. 30:\u2014\nOn the other hand, if a man is entitled to one of two inconsistent rights, it is fitting that when with full knowledge he has done an unequivocal act showing that he has chosen the one, he cannot afterwards pursue the other, which after the first choice is, by reason of the inconsistency, no longer his to choose.\nIn my opinion the respondent, on the facts in the case at bar, did not have any cause of action under the Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act, and therefore was not, in fact, faced with an election at all.\nIn order that a wife may obtain an order under s. 1, subsection (2) of the statute, she must have been\nliving apart from her husband because of * * * his refusal or neglect, without sufficient cause, to supply her with food and other necessaries when able so to do.\nIn a case where the parties are already living apart by consent when the refusal or neglect occurs, it cannot be said of the wife that she is living apart \u201cbecause of\u201d such refusal or neglect. In Hofland v. Hofland[40], it was held that a wife could not succeed under the statute where the husband and wife were not living together when the alleged desertion occurred. It may be that it was as a result of this decision that the amendment of 1935 set out above was made and that a case of desertion within the statute may be made out where the original separation was consensual but where, as indicated by Lord Greene in Pardy v. Pardy[41], its character has changed. It is not necessary to consider the effect of the amendment for whatever its effect may be in another case, neither of the parties to the instant case had changed his or her intention to live apart. It cannot, therefore, be said that the respondent, at the time she took the proceedings under the statute, was living apart from the appellant \u201cbecause of\u201d his refusal or neglect to maintain her. That being so, the respondent was not entitled to any rights under the statute and the learned magistrate so found.\nMoreover, for all that appears, and it was for the appellant to show otherwise if it were the fact, he did not change in those proceedings the position which he had earlier taken up in the correspondence, namely, insisting on the efficacy of the deed of separation. In these circumstances, the defence founded on election cannot succeed.\nIn my opinion the order made in favour of the infant does not affect the situation. S. 2 of the statute creates an independent liability on the part of the appellant toward his child, which, by s. 4, the respondent was entitled to assert on its behalf. No question arises in the present case as to the effect of the order upon the liability of the appellant under the covenant in the agreement with respect to the child\u2019s maintenance as there is no claim made in these proceedings with respect to the child.\nThe appellant\u2019s argument founded on estoppel, he admits, is involved in his argument with respect to election. It is therefore not necessary to deal separately with this contention.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal, by special leave, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming, without written reasons, a judgment of Gale J. in favour of the respondent for certain arrears under a separation deed.\nThe relevant facts are not disputed and may be briefly stated. The respondent is the wife of the appellant. They were married in 1935. There are two children of the marriage, a boy born March 1, 1937 and a girl born September 7, 1940. The parties finally separated in 1948 and subsequently entered into a separation deed, dated the 16th of September, 1948. They have lived apart ever since. The deed recites the marriage, the birth of the children, the fact that unhappy differences have arisen and that the parties have agreed to live separate and apart from each other and proceeds:\u2014\n4. Now this indenture witnesseth that in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, it is hereby agreed and declared as follows:\nThe deed provides that the husband shall have the custody of the boy and the wife of the girl with rights of reasonable access in each case.\nThe deed contains the following mutual covenants:\u2014\n5. The parties hereto will henceforth live separate and apart from each other, and neither of them will take proceedings against the other for the restitution of conjugal rights, or molest or annoy or interfere with the other in any manner whatsoever. Each party covenants and agrees with the other not to utter any words which would constitute defamation or slander of the other. Each party releases the other of all claims for anything existing up to the present time, except such rights or obligations as are imposed under the terms of this agreement.\nThe deed contains the following covenants by the husband:\u2014\n10. The husband will pay to the wife, as and for her separate property, an allowance of $30 on the third day of each month during the term of their joint lives if they shall so long live separate from each other, and on condition that and so long as the wife shall continue to lead a chaste life, the first of such payments to be made on the third day of August, 1948. The payments shall cease upon the remarriage of the wife.\nIt is expressly provided, however, that the payments of $30 per month are to be made up to and including the month of January, 1950, and commencing with the payment due on the third day of February, 1950, the said payments to the wife shall be increased to the sum of $40 per month.\n12. The husband shall pay for the maintenance of the said infant child, Jennifer Elizabeth Findlay, the sum of $35 per month, such payments to be made on the third day of each month, and to commence on the third day of August, 1948; and the payments to cease upon the said infant attending the age of eighteen years.\n14. In the event of the said infant child, Jennifer Elizabeth Findlay, requiring special medical or surgical treatment, the wife shall consult with the husband as to the treatment to be given, and the physician or physicians to be consulted and the husband shall pay to the wife a sum in addition to the monthly payment set forth in Paragraph 12 herein, sufficient to pay any medical or hospital accounts and all debts incurred. in connection with such treatment of the said child.\nThe husband also covenants to pay the sum of $50 to the wife and that she shall have certain chattels and furniture, set out in a schedule to the deed, it being expressly provided that the execution of the deed shall pass the title in such chattels to the wife. The deed contains a covenant on the part of the wife to bar dower and the following covenants:\u2014\n8. The wife shall have the custody and control of the infant child, Jennifer Elizabeth Findlay, and shall be responsible for her support, maintenance and education out of the moneys paid to her under the provisions of paragraph No. 12 of the within agreement, subject to the provisions of Paragraph No. 14 with regard to extra medical care.\n11. The wife agrees that from the date of this agreement she will pay her own debts and will keep the husband indemnified therefrom and if the wife shall make default in observing this covenant, all moneys which shall be paid by the husband in respect of any debt or liability of the wife shall be deducted by him out of the monthly instalments payable to the wife under the provisions of this agreement, saving and excepting therefrom only any payments or expenses which might be incurred by the wife in accordance with paragraph 14 hereof arising out of sickness, accident or other emergency on behalf of the infant child, the said Jennifer Elizabeth Findlay.\nThe husband made all payments provided in the deed up to and including the payment due on the 3rd of June, 1949. Following the making of this payment, which, at the request of the wife, was made a few days in advance of its due date, the wife wrote to the husband, on May 31, 1949, stating that unless he at once made her an increased living allowance she would not hesitate to take him into court. The letter says, in part: \u201cWhat have I got to lose?\u2014very little.\u201d It goes on to say that any court \u201cwould hardly allot us less than $65.\u201d It mentions that the court proceedings would be embarrassing to the husband, uses the expression \u201cwhen I walk into court I shall have thrown my hat over the windmill\u201d, says that the court proceedings might get the wife custody of the son and concludes\n* * * to proclude (sic) further stalling the least amount I would consider now, not next February is $100 a month and that is not unreasonable. I would not bother with a divorce unless the whole thing were in the form of a settlement, said settlement to be equivalent to at least ten (10) years of aforesaid allowance. I would suggest that you reply with as little delay as possible as we are completely ready to go ahead. I am affording you this last courtesy of a letter from me, rather than my lawyers.\nUnder date of June 29, 1949, the husband wrote a long letter in answer in which he says, in part:\u2014\nYou are renouncing the payments under the agreement. Very well, I consent to this repudiation, but with one reservation, if it is open to me to make it. If it is not open to me, I will not let that reservation prevent your renunciation being complete. But at least, should the occasion arise, I will argue that the agreement is divisible and that I can still rely on the clauses concerning living separate, defamation, release of prior claims, custody of Peter, dower. If my argument should fail, your repudiation will be complete.\nYou are free, therefore, to attempt any court proceedings you feel like, but I will defend my position to the end * * *\n* * *\nNow that you have thrown over the provisions made in the agreement for the two of you, two results follow immediately. There will be no more cheques for you and you will kindly make arrangements to return Jennifer to my care immediately.\nTo this letter the wife replied on or about July 3, 1949:\u2014\nAlright (sic) Don, I am quite willing to fight this thing out in court\u2014sooner or later it had to come to a head.\nIn the concluding paragraph of the letter, after reproaching the appellant with having paid attention, prior to the date of the separation deed, to two women who are named the respondent continues:\u2014\n* * * I\u2019m bringing these few isolated occurrences to your attention because I wonder if you\u2019ve forgotten? Fortunately for me but unfortunately for them these people are all readily accessible and it is only your stubborness to see reason that makes it necessary to smear them as well as you.\nSee you in court.\nThe husband made no further payments under the deed, and the wife made application for maintenance for herself and the daughter in the York County Family Court, under The Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act, on July 8, 1949, the instalment under the deed due on July 3rd being then in arrears. After an adjournment on July 19, 1949, the application was disposed of by the Magistrate on July 26, 1949, the adjudication being in the following words:\u2014\nDismissed as to wife. Order for $10 per week for support of child, first payment to be made July 26, 1949, at the York County Family Court Office.\nThe husband has ever since paid the $10 per week. Neither party has taken any steps under s. 5 of the Act to have the application reheard or to rescind or vary the order of the Magistrate and such order is still in force.\nIn October, 1949, the wife commenced an action in the First Division Court of the County of York for the arrears under paragraph 10 of the deed commencing with the payment falling due on July 3, 1949. This action was transferred to the Supreme Court of Ontario by order of Gale J. and the action was tried by that learned judge. The effect of his judgment is to hold that the wife is entitled to enforce the covenant contained in paragraph 10 of the deed and at the same time to enforce the order of the Magistrate requiring payments of $10 a week. No attempt was made by the wife to assert a claim under paragraph 12 of the deed.\nFor the appellant it is argued that the respondent, by her earlier letter referred to above, unequivocally repudiated the contract, that this repudiation was accepted by the appellant in his letter of June 29th and that the contract thereupon ceased to exist. While I do not find it necessary to decide whether this is so, I incline to the view that it is not. I regard the wife\u2019s letter of May 31st as a definite statement that she was no longer going to regard herself as bound by the contract and was going to seek her rights at law outside its provisions. It may well be that it was then open to the husband to accept this as a complete repudiation by the wife and to notify her that he was treating the contract as at an end but I incline to the view that he did not do so. I read his letter of July 29th, quoted in part above, as a conditional, not an unqualified, acceptance in which he seeks to take the position that the wife has forfeited all her rights under the agreement but that he retains at least some of his rights.\nFor the same reason I do not think that the husband\u2019s letter of June 29th amounted to an unconditional offer to regard the contract as at an end which can be said to have been accepted by the wife\u2019s letter of July 4th but, again, I do not find it necessary to determine this question. For the purposes of this appeal I will assume, without deciding, that counsel for the respondent is right in his contention that after the letter of July 4th was delivered to the husband the wife was still in a position to insist that the contract was in force. At this time, however, as has been mentioned above, the husband had made default in the payments due on July 3rd. It is true that the reason he assigned for this was the unequivocal statement of the wife that she did not intend to abide by the contract but the fact remains that he made default not through inadvertence or temporary financial embarrassment but deliberately and in pursuance of his statement quoted above \u201cThere will be no more cheques for you.\u201d His default was not of the temporary sort made by the husband in Kunski v. Kunski[42], which was held by the learned President not to entitle the wife to regard the deed as repudiated by the husband. It was rather of the sort dealt with in Kennedy v. Kennedy[43], where default was accompanied by the expressed intention not to make further payments and was held to entitle the wife to regard the deed as at an end.\nIn Kunski v. Kunski (supra) the learned President said at page 19:\u2014\nI quite agree that this is a matter of great importance, and a substantial part of the consideration for the deed; and if a serious and substantial refusal by the respondent to pay one of the instalments can be shewn, then he is not entitled to enforce a deed from the terms of which he has departed.\nI am of opinion that following the husband\u2019s default in making the payments due on July 3rd the wife had the option of insisting upon the contract or of treating it as at an end and pursuing such rights as she might have apart from the contract. The effect of the judgment in appeal is to hold that having chosen the latter alternative and pursued her rights apart from the contract by proceedings in the Family Court the wife may, if dissatisfied with the result of such proceedings, re-assert her rights under the contract. This is challenged by the appellant and is the substantial point to be decided on this appeal.\nIn approaching the solution of the question it is well to bear in mind the words of Lord Atkin in Hyman v. Hyman[44] where, after referring to a separation deed as \u201ca class of document which has had a chequered career at law\u201d, he continues:\u2014\nFull effect has therefor to be given in all Courts to these contracts as to all other contracts. It seems not out of place to make this obvious reflection, for a perusal of some of the cases in the matrimonial Courts seems to suggest that at times they are still looked at askance, and enforced grudgingly. But there is no caste in contracts. Agreements for separation are formed, construed and dissolved and to be enforced on precisely the same principles as any respectable commercial agreement, of whose nature indeed they sometimes partake. As in other contracts stipulations will not be enforced which are illegal either as being opposed to positive law or public policy. But this is a common attribute of all contracts, though we may recognize that the subject-matter of separation agreements may bring them more than others into relation with questions of public policy. It appears to me that the applicable rules of contract law are well settled. The default by the husband in the circumstances mentioned above amounted in law to a repudiation by him of the contract (or, if the contract be regarded as severable which I do not think it is, of those parts of it dealing with the obligation of the husband to make payments and of the wife to accept such payments and keep the husband indemnified from further claims). Such repudiation by one party could not of itself discharge the contract. The wife had a choice of remedies. She might sue the husband on the contract or she might treat it as at an end. If the wife chose the latter course the result would follow that the contract would no longer be in existence and the situation would be as stated in Lush on Husband and Wife, 4th Edition, (1933), pages 385 and 386:\u2014\nIt would seem that since the right of a married woman to maintenance is established in status, not contract, and in common law, not statute, that upon the payments appointed under the agreement terminated from any cause, the wife\u2019s right to be maintained by her husband would revive, and she could either pledge his credit as agent of necessity for her necessaries, or seek from him the payment of maintenance by the methods that are secured to a wife by statute * * *\nThe wife chose to treat the contract as at an end. She could not in the Family Court sue upon the contract. She sought there an order for payments in excess of those which the contract provided but this fact is not of importance. The important fact is that she sought payment by one of the methods secured to her by statute and not by virtue of the contract.\nHaving done this, it is my view that she could not at any later date take the position that the contract was still in force. She had made her election. Election is defined in Wharton\u2019s Law Lexicon, 12th Ed., page 317, quoted with approval in Cooper v. C.N.O.R.[45] as \u201cThe obligation conferred upon a person to choose between two inconsistent or alternative rights or claims.\u201d In Scarf v. Jardine[46], Lord Blackburn said:\u2014\nThe principle, I take it, running through all the cases as to what is an election is this, that where a party in his own mind has thought that he would choose one of two remedies, even though he has written it down on a memorandum or has indicated it in some other way, that alone will not bind him; but so soon as he has not only determined to follow one of his remedies but has communicated it to the other side in such a way as to lead the opposite party to believe that he has made that choice, he has completed his election and can go no further; and whether he intended it or not, if he has done an unequivocal act\u2014I mean an act which would be justifiable if he had elected one way and would not be justifiable if he had elected the other way\u2014the fact of his having done that unequivocal act to the knowledge of the persons concerned is an election:\nWe were not referred to any case in which a wife has obtained an order for maintenance, or an award of alimony, by way of supplement to the sums being paid to her under a separation deed. I do not mean by this that a wife is of necessity limited to the payments under a separation deed or that such a deed can always be successfully pleaded in bar in proceedings either for alimony or maintenance during the subsistence of marriage or for maintenance on its dissolution. Such a question does not arise in this appeal. It has recently been held in England that a wife, who is receiving payments under a separation deed which are so inadequate that it can be said that the husband is neglecting to provide reasonable maintenance for her, may take proceedings for maintenance either before the justices or in the high court,\u2014see Tulip v. Tulip[47]. It has also been held that no separation deed can oust the jurisdiction of the court to decree maintenance for a wife on the dissolution of her marriage,\u2014see Hyman v. Hyman (supra). I have found no case in which upon a wife taking proceedings to require a husband to make payments differing from and in excess of those provided by a separation deed the husband, instead of insisting on the deed, has taken the position that the deed is at an end, and in which the deed has been held to remain in force. To so decide would, I think, be contrary to the principle that a person may not approbate and reprobate. A result of so deciding would be that a provision in a separation deed for periodical payments to be made during the joint lives of the spouses would amount to nothing more than the statement of an irreducible minimum, binding the husband but leaving the wife free, so often as she might please and in such forums as she might choose, to seek additional payments. It is one thing to hold that the power conferred upon the courts by statute to require a husband to properly maintain his wife cannot be fettered by agreement between the parties, but quite another thing to hold that a wife may continue throughout the joint lives of herself and her husband to rely upon a separation deed while seeking support by proceedings in the court outside of, and in a manner inconsistent with, the terms of the deed.\nI have not overlooked the fact that in the judgments in Hyman v. Hyman (supra) expressions were used indicating that in the proceedings to fix maintenance which were to follow the judgment the court might well hold the provisions of the separation deed there under consideration to constitute sufficient maintenance and that similar expressions are found in the judgment in Tulip v. Tulip (supra); but in each of these cases the husband, far from seeking to repudiate the deed, had at all times faithfully performed it, was willing to continue to do so, was expressly taking the position that the deed remained in force and was relying on it as constituting a sufficient provision for the wife. I find nothing in the judgments in either case to suggest that on the wife commencing the proceedings for maintenance it would not have been open to the husband to elect to treat the deed as at an end. In neither case did that question arise.\nI find myself in agreement with the conclusion of McDonald J., as he then was, in Bouveur v. Bouveur[48], which judgment was, at least by implication, approved by the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan in Wagner v. Wagner[49]. Bouveur v. Bouveur was an action by a wife against her husband to enforce the maintenance provisions of a separation agreement. The relevant facts, admitted in a stated case, were that the husband and wife had been living apart for some years under a separation agreement a term of which was that the husband should make semimonthly payments to the wife. Partial default had been made in payment of the instalments due on February 15th and March 1st, 1936. On March 23, 1936, upon the wife\u2019s application, an order had been made under the Deserted Wives, Maintenance Act requiring the husband to pay $20 a week to the wife. On November 23, 1936, an order had been made under the same Act rescinding the earlier order and this had been affirmed on appeal. On these facts the question submitted to the court was: \u201cHas the plaintiff by proceeding under the Deserted Wives\u2019 Maintenance Act elected her remedy and thereby disentitled herself from enforcing against the defendant the provisions of the said separation agreement as to payment of maintenance and support?\u201d This question was answered in the affirmative. It will be observed that it was not the making of the order by the magistrate but the election by the wife to proceed under the Act instead of on the contract which brought the latter to an end. I do not find anything in the Ontario cases referred to by the learned trial judge which appears to me to be at variance with the conclusion reached in the Bouveur case. In neither Moyer v. Moyer[50], nor Smellie v. Smellie[51] did any question of contractual rights arise. Except for one sentence, which I have italicized, it seems to me that the following passages in the judgment of McTague J.A. concurred in by Middleton and Masten JJ.A. in Stevens v. Stevens[52], support the reasoning in the Bouveur judgment:\u2014At page 245:\u2014\nThe question of the defendant\u2019s liability for the difference between what he is ordered to pay by the Domestic Relations Court and what is stipulated for by the separation agreement is much more important.\nAt pages 245 and 246:\u2014\nThe plaintiff had alternative remedies as I see it, not cumulative remedies. She was bound to elect. Counsel for the plaintiff has argued strenuously that the Domestic Relations Court has no jurisdiction with respect to the separation agreement. With that I agree. All the Act provides in this regard is that the circumstance of a separation agreement shall not in itself take the plaintiff out of the category of a deserted wife and thereby bar her from relief under the Act: sec. 1(2). The plaintiff\u2019s difficulty, as I see it, does not arise from any lack of jurisdiction in the Domestic Relations Court with respect to the separation agreement but from her own election to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court notwithstanding the separation agreement. It is unnecessary to decide whether the order of the Domestic Relations Court abrogates the agreement, but I take the view that the operation of the separation agreement is under suspension as long as the order is outstanding.\nAt pages 246 and 247:\u2014\nAs I see it, she has chosen to forego her rights under the agreement and cannot be allowed to adopt part of it in answer to the consequences of her own act.\nCounsel for the respondent argued that the correct inference to be drawn from the italicized words quoted above is that notwithstanding the proceedings in the Domestic Relations Court the agreement remained in force, although temporarily under suspension and would revive if and when that court\u2019s order terminated. As I read his judgment, McTague J.A. expressly refrained from so deciding, being of the view that a decision on the point was unnecessary. I think that the suggested inference would be at variance with the other portions of his reasons set out above.\nIn the case at bar, for the reasons given above, I am of opinion that the separation deed is no longer in force. The deed has come to an end because, the husband having made default in an essential matter, the wife elected to treat it as at an end and to pursue her rights apart from contract.\nI, of course, express no opinion as to whether or not the wife should have been refused maintenance by the magistrate. The Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act provides for rehearings and for the confirmation, rescission or variation of any order made in that court. Nor do I express any opinion as to the wife\u2019s right to alimony if she should require the husband to receive her and support her as his wife and he should refuse to do so or if the facts are such that she is entitled, apart from the provisions of the separation deed, to live apart from him and to require him to maintain her. In my view all that we have to decide on this appeal is whether the deed of separation remains in force and I have already indicated that, in my opinion, it does not.\nI would allow the appeal and direct that judgment be entered dismissing the action. There should be no order as to the costs of this appeal or of the motion for leave to appeal or in the courts below.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: R.M.W.

Linford v. Provincial Horse & Cattle Insurance Co., 34 Beav. 291, followed. Mackie v. European Assurance Society, 21 L.T. (N.S.) 102; Murfitt v. Royal Insurance, 38 T.L.R. 334; Kline Bros. v. Dominion Fire Insurance Co., 47 Can. S.C.R. 252 and Grimmer v. Merchants' & Manufacturers' Fire Insurance Co., 4 M.P.R. 582, distinguished. Potvin v. Glen Falls Insurance Co., [1931] 1 W.W.R. 380 at 390, approved.\nAssuming that in the case at bar the sub-agent had authority to receive payment of the premium with the application, all that amounted to was, as pointed out in Linford v. Provincial Horse & Cattle Insurance Co., supra, at 293, that he had made \"a proposal with a deposit which the company was entitled either to accept or reject, and the company never having accepted it, was not bound.\"\nThere is no authority binding upon this Court which lays down as a rule of presumption that one who testifies to an affirmative is to be credited in preference to one who testifies to a negative. Taschereau J. in Lefeunteum v. Beaudoin 28 Can. S.C.R. 89 at 93-94 was speaking only for himself and his statement, so far as it is inconsistent with this decision, cannot be supported.\nDecision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, 28 M.P.R. 59, reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick 1 reversing the judgment of Anglin J. dismissing respondent's action against appellant. J. L. O'Brien K.C. for the appellant. The issues are limited to the question of whether Robidoux, if he told respondent that he was insured, bound appellant by so doing. The question of the liability of the other defendant Anderson is not in issue, as there has been no appeal from the judgment dismissing the action against Anderson. The questions in issue are essentially questions of fact to be decided on the evidence at trial, and the questions of fact to be decided are, 1. Whether Robidoux had ostensible authority to bind any one. 2. Whether, if he had such authority, it could be said to be authority to bind Anderson or to bind appellant.\nIn the judgment appealed from the question of whether Robidoux had authority to bind any one is dealt with very briefly with the following remarks:\u2014\"That is the usual custom among fire insurance agents. It would be detrimental to business if they did not have such authority.\" It is clear from the evidence that the custom of the insurance business in New Brunswick is such that power to bind on the part of an agent is the exception rather than the rule, only one of every twenty having such power, and that Robidoux did not have that power. In the light of the evidence it is difficult to understand how the Court of Appeal could have found as it did. Not only was the trial judge right in his finding that there was no evidence of Robidoux' power to bind, but that, on the contrary, the only evidence was to the effect that he had no such power and that it was not the usual custom for an agent to have such power. Hughes J. suggests that although Robidoux had only authority to canvass insurance, he could bind his principal if he exceeded that authority, quoting from Mackie v. European Assurance Co. 2. That case is not an authority for the finding that Robidoux with authority only to canvass for insurance could bind his principal if he exceeded this authority. Even if it could be said Robidoux had authority to bind, such authority was not on behalf of the appellant. There is no evidence that he had any authority to bind, but, if he had, it must have been on behalf of J. A. Anderson & Co. or other insurers with which that company placed risks. Not only is it clear from the record that the appellant never allowed Robidoux to hold himself out as having authority, but that the respondent himself admits that he did not even know the name of the appellant until after the loss occurred. On the facts, this is not a case where the Appeal Court should have reversed the trial judge. Roche v. Marston 3 per Kerwin J. at 496. Hughes J., without expressly so stating, seems to imply from the authorities he quotes that in law an insurance agent when taking an application, is empowered to bind the insurer. In the present instance, if such were true, it would not be the appellant who would be bound. The case of Kline Bros. & Co. v. Dominion Insurance Co. 4 referred to, it is submitted, is of no authority in the present instance, nor Grimmer v. Merchants & Manufacturers Insurance Co. 5. In that case the sub-agent had the necessary powers or qualifications. The Court also held that the general agent had approved the sub-agent's binder.\nThe question of whether or not an insurance agent can bind the insurer is, in each case, a question to be decided on the particular facts of the case. Insurance agents, like other agents, may have very limited or very extensive powers. Welsford & Otter Barry's Fire Insurance 4th Ed. p. 84; Bowstead on Agency 4th Ed. 82-3, 273; Potvin v. Glen Falls Insurance Co. 6; Newsholme v. Road Transport & General Insurance Co. 7.\nE. G. Gowling K.C. for the respondent. The respondent supports the judgment of the Court of Appeal. There was no restriction on Anderson's authority. If Anderson had dealt directly with the respondent and told him he was insured, the appellant would have been bound because Anderson was its general agent. That it was the only company for which both Robidoux and Anderson were acting in the transaction is conclusively proved by the fact that when Robidoux notified Anderson of the fire, the latter's immediate reaction was to telephone the appellant in Montreal and advise that the application had arrived, a fire had occurred, and he was disclaiming liability, to which the appellant agreed. MacGillivray on Insurance Law, 3rd Ed. at page 389 points out there is no absolute rule of law requiring a contract of fire insurance to be made out in any particular form; at 390, that there is nothing in law to prevent a valid contract of insurance being constituted by informal writing or even by mere oral communication; and at 391, if the contract may be fully performed with the year, the Statute of Frauds, does not apply.\nAppellant's counsel submitted that the words in the application \"All insurance subject to the approval of the company,\" placed the burden on the plaintiff to prove the approval. These words do not mean that the Head Office must approve. Such approval can be given by the general agent or the sub-agent if authorized to bind. If Head Office does not care for the risk it has the privilege of cancelling but until that is done the insurance is in force. One way of expressing approval is to tell the applicant he is covered, another is to accept the premium.\nAs to the sub-agent's authority. This is the issue in the case and is not to be decided by Anderson. His statement to the Court that Robidoux had no authority to bind was volunteered without his knowing any of the instructions given to the sub-agent. He left all the instructions to his office manager, who was not called; nor was any one from Head Office, which was notified of the appointment, called to state the nature of the authority. Anderson's statement that the sub-agent did not write policies is probably correct, but that the sub-agent did not have interim and renewal receipts may be questioned. Robidoux was a member of the Board of Fire Underwriters. Not only could he have got the application form but interim receipts from it as well. It is therefore quite conclusive that the sub-agent's authority did not depend on what forms were supplied him by his principal.\nAnderson knew Robidoux was accepting premiums at the time of taking applications. If it is a fact that he told Robidoux to fill in the application and forward it to him and he would try and place it (which the respondent does not admit, but denies), he should have warned Robidoux then and there not to accept any premium or make any commitments until he had placed it. It is open to this Court to find that the risk was approved then and there by Anderson. That in all probability he told Robidoux to cover and collect the premium. Welsford & Otter-Barry's Fire Insurance, 3rd Ed. p. 80 states: \"The acceptance of the proposal by the insurers may be more or less conclusively shown in one or other of the following ways namely \u2026\n\"(2) By accepting the premium. Where no policy has been issued to the proposers before the loss, the receipt of the premium and its retention by the insurers, though by no means conclusive may raise the presumption, in the absence of any circumstances leading to the contrary conclusion, that the insurers have definitely accepted his proposal. In such a case they are not entitled to refuse to issue a policy to him, and they are, therefore, liable to him in the event of a loss.\" at p. 191, \"The insurers, by accepting the payment of the premium, may, even where no policy has been issued, be estopped from denying the existence of a contract of insurance between the assured and themselves.\"\nMcElroy v. London Assurance Corp. 8 per Lord Maclaren at 291.\nAuthority is a question of fact. Murfitt v. Royal Insurance Co. Ltd. 9. The receipt given comes within this category. Hals. 2nd Ed. 423. Murfitt v. Royal Insurance Co. supra, which it is stated was followed in Parker & Co. (Southbank) v. Western Assurance 10.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nKerwin J.:\u2014This is an appeal by World Marine and General Insurance Company Limited (hereafter called the company), against a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, allowing an appeal by the plaintiff, Yvon Leger, against the judgment at the trial which had dismissed his action. Suit was brought not only against the company but also against J. Arthur Anderson carrying on the business of an insurance agent at Saint John under the name of J. A. Anderson & Co. and the said J. A. Anderson & Co. As the trial judge's dismissal of the action against Anderson was affirmed by the Appeal Division, and no appeal from that part of the latter's judgment has been taken by the plaintiff, we are not concerned with the claim against Anderson although it will be necessary to refer to his position in the events under review.\nThe claim before us is for the recovery of the sum of $7,000, for which amount the plaintiff claims the company insured him on May 30, 1947, against loss by fire of his portable sawmill near Shediac in New Brunswick. The mill was destroyed by fire the following day. No policy of insurance was issued but the plaintiff relies on an alleged verbal contract between himself and one Maurice Robidoux and claims that in making that contract Robidoux acted as the agent of the company so as to bind the latter. The company denies the contract and in any event, alleges that Robidoux had no authority either actual or implied to bind it. In order to determine these issues, it is necessary to examine the relevant facts in some detail.\nAt all material times the company was an insurer carrying on the business of fire insurance in New Brunswick. J. Arthur Anderson had an agency contract with the company by which he was appointed its general agent for the province in respect of all classes of fire insurance authorized by the company to be written in the province as it might from time to time determine. Clause 4 of this contract provides:\nThe agent, in consideration of the remuneration hereinbefore specified, agrees faithfully to perform and observe the duties of a general agent. He may appoint sub-agents and accept applications for insurance in the classes which the company shall authorize the agent to undertake in the province of New Brunswick. He agrees to be governed by the judgment and opinion of the company as to lines and classes of hazards to be insured and to recognize at all times the authority of the company as to cancellation of certain lines or classes of hazards and to be governed by such rules and regulations as may from time to time be issued by the company.\nAnderson had about 60 sub-agents, of whom 6 had specific power to bind on his behalf. In the entire province there are about 800 licensed insurance agents of whom only 41 have specific power to bind the insurance companies. Prior to January. 1947, Maurice Robidoux had been soliciting accident and sickness insurance for Anderson as a sub-agent. He never had a written contract with Anderson, nor did he ever have in his possession interim receipts or renewal applications. His powers as sub-agent were limited to taking applications. In connection with any business resulting in the issuing of a policy, he would be billed at the end of each month for the total of the premiums less his commissions. It was his responsibility to see that the premiums were collected and one feature greatly relied upon by the repondent is that, to Anderson's knowledge, Robidoux would, in many, if not all cases, receive the premium at the time the application was signed.\nIn January 1947, Robidoux commenced soliciting fire risks on behalf of Anderson and in April he submitted to Anderson an application for $4,000 fire insurance on a portable sawmill belonging to Thomas J. Kingston. On behalf of the company Anderson accepted this application and issued and delivered a policy. When the company learned of this it sent Anderson a letter on April 18th advising him that portable sawmills were in the category of risks upon which they looked with disfavour. This information was immediately conveyed to Robidoux in a letter from Anderson and finally, the Kingston matter was arranged by Anderson securing the cancellation of the policy and the issuance of a policy for $2,000 by the company and the issuance of policies by other insurers to cover the balance of the $4,000. Later Robidoux called Anderson and asked him if he could place insurance on a portable sawmill belonging to one Philias LeBlanc. This was arranged by $2,000 of the risk being placed with the company and the balance with other insurers.\nWe now come to the specific circumstances giving rise to the claim advanced by the respondent. In January 1947 Robidoux saw the respondent in connection with sickness and accident insurance and truck insurance and as he understood the respondent was going to purchase a portable sawmill, suggested that the respondent take out fire insurance on it. The respondent said that he would see Robidoux when he had purchased the mill. Either at this or a subsequent interview Robidoux handed the respondent a business card reading as follows:\ncCc MAURICE ROBIDOUX\nJ. A. Anderson & Co.\n86 Prince William St. Saint John, N.B.\n(It was explained that \"cCc\" are the initials of another company, not a fire insurance company).\nSoon after the purchase of the mill and between May 1st and May 20, 1947, the respondent saw Robidoux on the street at Shediac and asked him what the insurance would cost. Robidoux said that he would call Anderson on the telephone. This he did when Anderson told him to fill in the application and forward it \"and I will try to place it.\" Anderson also told him that the premium for $7,000 coverage would be $315. According to the evidence of Robidoux at the trial he told the respondent not only the amount of the premium but also that Anderson had said that he would try to place the insurance, or as he put it in another way, \"I told him they (fire insurance risks on portable sawmills) were very hard to place and would have to be brokered out.\" Not having the money, the respondent told Robidoux that he would see him later.\nThe next meeting occurred on the night of Friday, May 30th, at Robidoux's house. The respondent paid the money and received a receipt on an ordinary receipt form which merely states that Robidoux had received from the respondent $315 \"for fire insurance on mill.\" At the same time the respondent signed an \"Application for Farm Risks and Country Dwellings\", not addressed to any particular insurance company but \"To the \u2026. Insurance Company Limited.\" At the foot of the first sheet of this application immediately above the date and the respondent's signature appears in heavy type \"All Insurances Subject to the Approval of the Company.\" The respondent's testimony that on this occasion Robidoux told him that \"starting from that time I was insured,\" was denied by Robidoux.\nIt should here be explained that in his reasons for judgment the trial judge first came to the conclusion that the action against the company must be dismissed on the ground that there was no evidence of the authority of anyone, and in particular of Robidoux, to effect the alleged insurance by the company. Undoubtedly, as the trial judge held, Robidoux's examination for discovery, part of which had been put in at the trial, was not evidence against the company and on the argument before this Court we announced our agreement with the trial judge that the order for the examination of J. Arthur Anderson \"and Maurice Robidoux, agent of the above named defendant, J. A. Anderson & Co., for discovery,\" refers only to the defendants, J. Arthur Anderson and J. A. Anderson & Co.\nAfter disposing of the claim against the company, the trial judge proceeded to discuss the claim against Anderson. It was in that connection that he decided that Robidoux had told the respondent on May 30th that the latter was insured. He did this on the basis that, being unable to say whether the story of Robidoux or the respondent was correct, one who testifies to an affirmative is to be credited in preference to one who testifies to a negative, referring to the remarks of Taschereau J. in Lefeunteum v. Beaudoin 11. In considering whether, at the meeting in Shediac between May 1st and 20th, Robidoux had told the respondent that Anderson would try to place the insurance, or whether, as the respondent testified no such statement was made, the trial judge also, as to the claim against Anderson, on the same basis decided that Robidoux had told the respondent that the insurance had to be \"brokered out.\"\nThe remarks of Taschereau J. in the case referred to have been adopted and followed by trial judges in several decisions in Canada and it is therefore advisable to point out that Mr. Justice Taschereau was speaking only for himself. However, he referred to an extract from the judgment of the Master of the Rolls in Lane v. Jackson 12, and to what was said by Baron Parke speaking for the Judicial Committee in Chowdry Deby Persad v. Chowdry Dowlut Sing 13. I doubt that the Master of the Rolls or Baron Parke or Mr. Justice Taschereau were dealing with the matter otherwise than as set forth in 6 Law Magazine (1831) 348 at 370, referred to with approval in chapter 8 on Presumptions in Prof. Thayer's Preliminary Treatise on Evidence in a foot-note at page 313, i.e., that what was involved was a mere natural presumption which, according to Mr. Starkie as set forth in 6 Law Magazine, is derived wholly by means of the common experience of mankind, from the course of nature and the ordinary habits of society. The word \"presumption\" used by Mr. Starkie is unfortunate and liable to misconstruction and it is putting it too high to say, as Mr. Justice Taschereau is reported to have said, that it is a \"rule of presumption.\" There is no decision binding upon this Court which lays down any such mechanical formula. It is in every case the duty of the tribunal of fact to ascertain the facts in the light of all the circumstances present in the particular case. It would appear perhaps more logical where the Court finds itself faced with a choice between two witneses testifying to the affirmative and negative, respectively, of a particular proposition, if it finds itself unable to choose, after taking into consideration all the circumstances, that the decision should be that the burden of proof has not been met, than that the finding should be for the affirmative. It may be that in all the circumstances of a given case the Court could come to the conclusion that the affirmative should be accepted, but it should not do so on the basis of the application of any rule of thumb.\nIn the present case we are willing to assume that Robidoux told the respondent on May 30 that the latter was insured but on a reading of the record we are satisfied that at the earlier interview Robidoux told the respondent that Anderson had said he would \"try\" to place the insurance, thus indicating to the respondent that the proposal had not been finally accepted.\nOn Saturday, May 31, the mill was destroyed by fire but the application had already been sent through the post office by Robidoux to Anderson and it was with the incoming mail on Anderson's desk in Saint John on the following Monday morning when Robidoux telephoned Anderson and advised him of the fire. A few days later Robidoux saw the respondent who asked him the name of the company he (Robidoux) was acting for, whereupon Robidoux handed him the heading of a printed copy of agents' returns showing the name of the appellant company. Undoubtedly, until that time the respondent did not know the name of the company but this fact is of no importance to the legal problem involved. Robidoux sent a cheque for the amount of the premium to the respondent who, however, declined to accept it as that would prejudice his claim.\nIn these circumstances there can be no doubt that Robidoux was not an actual agent for the company so as to bind it to any insurance either in writing or orally but it is argued that he falls within that class of agent for whose contract with a proposed insured an insurer should be held liable. It is of the utmost importance that Robidoux had nothing from the company in the way of interim receipts or even official receipts with the name of the company on them and in fact nothing to indicate that he had any authority to enter into a binding contract of insurance on its behalf. Furthermore, the application form signed by the respondent clearly states \"All Insurances Subject to the Approval of the Company,\" and as stated above the proper conclusion on the evidence is that Robidoux told the respondent that Anderson would \"try\" to place the proposed insurance or that it would be \"brokered out.\" All cases such as this must be determined upon their own circumstances and the facts that on May 30th Robidoux received payment of the $315 and told the respondent he was insured do not separately or in conjunction add anything, no matter what effect they might have under other conditions. Estoppel was not pleaded but even if it were there is nothing to show that anything that happened in connection wtih the Kingston and LeBlanc applications ever came to the knowledge of the respondent and therefore he did not act upon any holding out that could possibly have been otherwise urged.\nHughes J. speaking for the Appeal Division referred to the decision of Vice Chancellor Malins in Mackie v. The European Assurance Society 14. There, however, as pointed out by McCardie J. in Murfitt v. The Royal Insurance Company Limitedi 15, the agent had been supplied with a book of printed forms and it was held that he was authorized to make contracts on behalf of The European Assurance Society in accordance with the terms in the forms. In Linford v. The Provincial Horse & Cattle Insurance Company 16, the Master of the Rolls held that it was not the ordinary duty of an agent of a company to grant or contract to grant policies of assurance. In that case the plaintiff had paid the agent 10s on account but it was held all the plaintiff had done was to make a proposal with a deposit, which the company was entitled either to accept or reject. In the Murfitt case McCardie J. stated the Linford decision to be good law but he then referred to the Mackie decision. McCardie J. pointed out that in the case before him the agent occupied a position in which he might well have been authorized to give oral cover and that he had been habitually giving it for 2 years before, to the knowledge of his superiors and with their consent. It was on that ground and on the special facts of the case that judgment was directed to be entered for Murfitt. The decisions in Murfitt and Mackie depend upon their own particular facts.\nHughes J. also referred to Kline Bros. & Co. v. Dominion Fire Insurance Company 17, and the remarks of Chief Justice Fitzpatrick at page 255. The quotation from that page must be read in connection with the preceding sentence and a perusal of all the reasons makes it clear that the Court was there dealing with the question of an agent admittedly qualified to bind the company at the inception of a risk. The only other decision referred to by Hughes J. is Grimmer v. Merchants' and Manufacturers' Fire Insurance Company 18. There, the sub-agent had been supplied with interim receipts and had power to issue them, but as he had none with him at the time he accepted the application for insurance, he gave a verbal binder and it was held that the insurer was liable as if the interim receipt had been issued. These circumstances show that the decision is quite distinguishable.\nOn behalf of the respondent we were referred to two extracts from Welford & Otter-Barry on Fire Insurance, which in the 4th Ed. appear at pages 80, 81 and 198, and read as follows:\np. 80:\nThe acceptance of the proposal fey the insurers may be more or less conclusively shown in one or other of the following ways, namely:\np. 81:\n(2) By accepting the premium. Where no policy has been issued to the proposer before the loss, the receipt of the premium and its retention by the insurers, though by no means conclusive, may raise the presumption, in the absence of any circumstances leading to the contrary conclusion, that the insurers have definitely accepted his proposal. In such a case they are not entitled to refuse to issue a policy to him, and they are, therefore, liable to him in the event of a loss.\np. 198:\nThe insurers, by accepting the payment of the premium, may, even where no policy has been issued, be estopped from denying the existence of a contract of insurance between the assured and themselves.\nThere, however, the authors are discussing the effect of the acceptance of a premium by the insurers, that is, where no question arose as to the money having been received by the insurers or someone on their behalf. \"Accepting\" payment of the premium is, as explained in the text, \"receipt and retention.\" At p. 193 the authors deal with payment of premiums to an agent who has no authority to accept applications, and at p. 85, where the application is not accepted, the applicant is entitled to a return of the premium as is stated. Even assuming in the present case that Robidoux had authority to receive payment of the premium with the application, all that this amounts to from the standpoint of the respondent is, as pointed out by Sir John Romilly M.R. in Linford v. Provincial Horse and Cattle Insurance Company (supra), that he had made \"a proposal with a deposit which the company was entitled either to accept or reject, and the company never having accepted it, was not bound.\"\nMore to the point are the remarks of Ford J. in a case referred to by Counsel for the appellant, Potvin v. Glen Falls Insurance Co.19. We agree with Mr. Justice Ford's statement therein that in all cases where it was held that an agent of an insurance company had implied authority to bind the company, the agent either had in his posession some indicia of authority, some forms to implement his promise of an interim covering, or the course of dealing between the agent and his principal showed that, with the knowledge and consent of his superiors, he had been habitually exercising the authority he assumed. The same principle may, we think, be deduced from the statement in MacGillivray on Insurance Law, 3rd Ed. page 381. These remarks appear in an earlier edition of the textbook referred to by Ford J. except for a few additions, one of which is that acceptance of a premium by an agent who has no actual or apparent authority to contract, does not bind the company.\nIn the reasons for judgment in the Appeal Division, after referring to the fact that Robidoux was paid the premium and thereupon informed the plaintiff that he was insured it is stated \"That is a usual custom among fire insurance agents.\" We are unable to find any evidence in the record to support that statement.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Appeal Division set aside and that of the trial judge restored. The appellant is entitled to its costs in this Court and the Appeal Division.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Ritchie, McKelvey & Mackay.\nSolicitors for the respondent.
