The owner's wife with full knowledge of the contents of the instrument and without any compulsion by her husband, signed a consent thereto and acknowledged such consent in the presence of, and not, as required by s. 7(1) of The Dower Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 206, apart from her husband. Subsequently the owner entered into an oil and natural gas lease with other parties as to the same land on more advantageous terms and undertook to commence proceedings to rid the title of the lease granted to the appellant on the ground of alleged non-compliance with the provisions of The Dower Act.\nHeld: (Kerwin J. dissenting) that the instrument was a good, valid and subsisting \"contract for the sale of property\". Joggins Coal Co. Ltd. v. The Minister of National Revenue [1950] S.C.R. 470 applying Gowan v. Christie L.R. 2 Sc. & Div. 273 at 284; Re Aldam's Settled Estate [1902] 2 Ch. 46. Whether construed with respect to the minerals as land, as in Gowan's case, or as a demise of the surface to which is super-added a profit \u00e0 prendre, the result was the same. It provided for the sale of property and, under s. 9(1) of The Dower Act, there being an absence of fraud on the part of the purchaser, the wife was \"deemed\" to have consented to the sale \"in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\"\nPer: Estey J. When in s. 9(1) the Legislature used the general word \"property\", rather than \"homestead\" as in s. 3, it disclosed an intention that the provisions of s. 9(1) should apply in a manner other than to the homestead as a whole and used language sufficiently comprehensive to include, not only a portion of its acreage, but also some interest in the land or soil constituting the homestead. The words \"a contract for the sale of property\" in s. 9(1) are sufficiently comprehensive to include contracts for the sale of property generally and to include one such as here where it was not contemplated that a transfer under The Land Titles Act would be issued. The provisions of the lease in question constituted a sale of a profit \u00e0 prendre, or an interest in land, and notwithstanding the consent was not acknowledged apart from the husband, a valid \"contract for the sale of property\" by virtue of s. 9(1). Per: Kerwin J., (dissenting). It was unnecessary to determine whether the document in question was a sale of the oil and gas which might be found, or merely a lease with a grant of a profit \u00e0 prendre and Lord Cairn's remarks in Gowan v. Christie, supra, as to the nature of a mining lease, approved in Coltness Iron Co. v. Black 6 A.C. 315 at 335 and applied in the Joggins Coal Co. case supra, are irrelevant. If it was a sale, then it was not a \"contract\", and if it was a lease, then while it might be a contract, it was not one for sale. The document was not such a one as was envisaged by the Legislature in enacting s. 9(1) and not within its terms.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff-appellant from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta 1 affirming on an equal division the judgment of Howson, Chief Justice of the Trial Division, 2, dismissing the action with costs.\nH. W. Riley, Q.C. and M. H. Patterson for the appellant.\nG. M. D. Blackstock for the respondent.\nKerwin J. (dissenting) :\u2014This is an appeal by McColl-Frontenac Oil Company Limited against a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta 3, affirming, on an equal division, the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Trial Division 4. The respondents are Hiram Hamilton and his wife, the former of whom is the registered owner of a quarter-section of land in Alberta containing 160 acres less 2 acres for a road, upon which land is a house occupied as his residence. In March, 1947, what is designated an \"oil and gas mining lease\" from Hiram Hamilton to the appellant was signed by the former.\nBy it he leased to the appellant all of the said land for the purpose of drilling and operating for, producing and storing oil, gas and casinghead gas, laying and maintaining pipe lines, erecting and maintaining tanks, power stations, telegraph, telephone and power lines and all structures thereon necessary or useful to test for, drill for, produce, save, treat, store, transport, and take care of such products and for housing and boarding employees, to be held by the lessee for a space of ten years, renewable and to be renewed for successive renewal terms of ten years each, each of such successive renewal terms to commence forthwith upon the expiration of the then preceding term, for so long as gas, oil, casinghead gas or any of them are being produced from the said lands, or are being prospected or drilled for thereon, at the rental thereinafter set forth, subject to the covenants and conditions thereinafter contained. The appellant as lessee covenanted and agreed inter alia: to pay as rental a royalty of one-eighth of all oil and gas produced and saved from the lands and in the case of gas, used off the said lands or in the said lands or in the manufacture of casinghead gasoline; to pay in addition a cash rental of $3 per acre for the first year of the term; if the drilling of a well upon the lands should not have been commenced during the first year, to pay half-yearly in advance a \"delay rental\" of $1 per acre; to commence, within twelve months, the drilling of a well for oil or gas either upon the lands or within five miles from some point in the boundary thereof.\nThe cash rental of $474 provided for was paid at the time of the execution of the document. While during 1947 and 1948 a well, which turned out to be a \"dry hole\", was drilled within the five miles specified, at a cost in excess of $100,000, there appears to be no doubt that the appellant had intended and had prepared to drill such well even before the execution of the lease. The \"delay rental\" of $79 was paid regularly half-yearly. In the meantime, in March 1947, the appellant had filed a caveat; in October, 1950, Hiram Hamilton entered into a lease with other parties for the same purposes upon more advantageous terms; in November, 1950, notice was given the appellant requiring it to take proceedings on its caveat. In December, 1950, the appellant registered the document of March, 1947, in the Land Titles Office as a lease and then commenced the present action for a declaration that the lease is valid and subsisting and for an order continuing the caveat; and, in the alternative, for judgment for the total of the rentals paid, with interest and five percentum per annum on each amount from the date of its payment.\nThe respondents did not allege fraud but claimed that the lease was null and void for all purposes on the ground, that, relating as it did to the Hamilton homestead, it was not \"made with the consent in writing of the wife\", as provided in s. 3 of The Dower Act, R.S.A. 1942, chapter 206. By s. 2 of that Act:\u2014\n2. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,\u2014\n(a) \"Disposition\" means any disposition by act inter vivos which is required to be executed by the owner of the land disposed of, and includes every transfer, agreement of sale, lease or other instrument intended to convey or transfer any interest in land and every mortgage or incumbrance intended to charge land with the payment of a sum of money (and requiring to be so executed) and every devise or other disposition made by will; and includes every mortgage by deposit of certificate of title or other mortgage not requiring the execution of any document.\n(b) \"Homestead\" means,\u2014\n(i) land in a city, town or village, consisting of not more than four adjoining lots in one block, as shown on a plan duly registered in the proper Land Titles Office, on which the house occupied by the owner thereof as his residence is situated ;\n(ii) land other than that referred to in paragraph (i) of this definition on which the house occupied by the owner thereof as his residence is situated, consisting of not more than one quarter section.\nThen comes s. 3:\u2014\n3. Every disposition by act inter vivos of the homestead of any married man whereby the interest of the married man shall or may vest in any other person at any time during the life of the married man or during the life of the married man's wife living at the date of the disposition, shall be absolutely null and void for all purposes unless made with the consent in writing of the wife.\nSs. 6, 7 and 9, so far as material, are as follows:\u2014\n6. (1) Any consent required for the disposition inter vivos of the homestead, or for the purpose of establishing a change of residence under this Act shall, whenever any instrument by which the disposition is effected is produced for registration under the provisions of The Land Titles Act, be produced and registered therewith.\n(2) The consent may be embodied in or indorsed upon the instrument effecting the disposition.\n(3) The execution by the wife of any such disposition shall constitute a consent under this Act.\n7. (1) When a wife executes any instrument concerning any disposition or consent under this Act she shall acknowledge it, apart from her husband, to have been executed by her of her own free will and accord and without any compulsion on the part of her husband.\n(2) The acknowledgment may be made before any person authorized to take proof of the execution of instruments under The Land Titles Act, and a certificate thereof in Form B shall be indorsed on or attached to the instrument executed by her.\n9. (1) When any woman has executed a contract for the sale of property, or joined in the execution thereof with her husband, or given her consent in writing to the execution thereof, and the consideration under the contract has been totally or partly performed by the purchaser, she shall, in the absence of fraud on the part of the purchaser, be deemed to have consented to the sale, in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\n(2) When any subsequent disposition by way of transfer of the property is presented for registration under The Land Titles Act, the consent previously given, or the agreement executed, shall, if produced and filed with the Registrar be sufficient for the purposes of this Act.\nHamilton's wife was not a party to the lease and did not execute it but did sign the following Consent at the end thereof:\u2014\nCONSENT\nWife of Hiram Hamilton, the lessor herein I, LOUISE H. HAMILTON, of Calmar, in the Province of Alberta, do hereby give my consent to the within mentioned disposition of the said premises.\n\"Louise H. Hamilton\"\nEdward P. Lamar, a Commissioner for Oaths in and for the Province of Alberta, but who also was the agent of the appellant for the purpose of securing oil and gas leases signed a \"Certificate of Acknowledgment by Wife\", which follows Form B referred to in subsection 2 of s. 7:\u2014\nThis document was acknowledged before me by Louise H. Hamilton apart from her husband to have been executed by her of her own free will and accord and without any compulsion on the part of her husband, and she has further acknowledged that she was aware at the time of such execution of the contents thereof.\nDATED at Calmar, in the Province of Alberta, this 10th day of March, A.D. 1947.\n\"Edward P. Lamar\"\nA Commissioner for Oaths in and for The Province of Alberta.\nThe lease is undoubtedly a \"disposition\" under s. 2(a) and in view of the definition of \"homestead\" in s. 2(b) (ii) and particularly the last phrase thereof, Hamilton's homestead is not confined to the buildings thereon and the land immediately surrounding them. This is so notwithstanding these clauses in the document:\u2014\nWhen required by the Lessor, the Lessee will bury all pipe lines below ordinary plough depth and no well shall be drilled within two hundred (200) feet of any residence or barn now on the said lands, without the Lessor's consent \u2026.\nThe Lessee shall use only that portion of the surface of the said lands from time to time required in its operations, and shall pay compensation for damage by such operations to growing crops of the Lessor, and shall, when necessary to protect live stock of the Lessor, fence in all wells, and upon abandonment of any well, shall properly close the same and restore the site thereof to its condition prior to the commencement of drilling operations insofar as may be reasonably practicable. It has been held in Alberta that, notwithstanding that the wife of the owner of a homestead may sign the consent, such consent must be given in accordance with s. 7. Considering the objects of The Dower Act, there would seem to be no doubt that this is the correct construction. At one time there was a difference of opinion as to the effect of non-compliance but, in 1942, s. 3 was amended by inserting the word \"absolutely\" before \"null and void\" and the words \"for all purposes\" immediately thereafter, so that it now appears as extracted above.\nSubsection 1 of s. 9 refers to a contract for the absolute sale of property. It is unnecessary to determine the exact nature of the document before us, that is, whether it is a sale of the oil and gas which may be found, or merely a lease with a grant of a profit \u00e0 prendre. Lord Cairns' remarks as to the nature of a mining lease in Gowan v. Christie 5, approved by Lord Blackburn in Coltness Iron Co. v. Black 6, \"as a perfectly accurate statement\" and applied by this Court in Joggins Coal Company v. Minister of National Revenue 7, are not, in my opinion, relevant to this document. If it is a sale, then it is not a \"contract\" and, if it is a lease, then, while it may be a contract, it is not one for sale. If the specified conditions are met, then the married woman has consented \"in accordance with the provisions of this Act\" and I quite agree that subsection 2 merely provides for the occasion when a transfer is presented for registration under the Land Titles Act. However, a comparison of the words \"contract for the sale of property\" in subsection 1 with \"any subsequent disposition by way of transfer\" in subsection 2 supports the view that the Hamilton document is not one contemplated by the former. The object of the Act was to preserve the wife's life estate in the homestead which she has contingent upon her surviving her husband. If, however, the latter contracts to sell all his interest in the homestead, the wife may be assumed to know that by consenting thereto she is agreeing to forego the protection afforded her and therefore the legislature has declared that if the other conditions in subsection 1 are fulfilled such consent will be sufficient. On the other hand, it is an entirely different matter if the husband enters into a relationship such as that with which we are concerned. In short, my view is that the document is not such a one as was envisaged by the legislature in enacting subsection 1 and is not within its terms. There is no basis for the argument that there was an estoppel since, if The Dower Act was not complied with, the disposition is absolutely null and void for all purposes.\nAll the members of the Appellate Division held the views expressed in the last three paragraphs but only two agreed with the trial judge that the wife's execution of the consent in the presence of her husband is not an acknowledgment \"apart from her husband\" and that, therefore, subsection 1 of s. 7 had not been complied with. The other two members proceeded on the basis of a presumption in favour of official acts. Particularly bearing in mind that the Commissioner was also the agent of the appellant, I agree with the first two that any such presumption is met when all the parties present at the transaction gave evidence before the Court and that nothing has been shown to cast doubt upon the soundness of the trial judge's finding of fact.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs but the judgment at the trial should be amended by providing that in addition to Hiram Hamilton paying the appellant the sum of $948, he should also pay interest at the rate of five percentum per annum upon each amount making up that sum from the time of its payment to him by the appellant.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Kellock and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:\nKellock, J. :\u2014In this case the appellants claim under an oil and gas lease of March 9, 1947, executed by the respondent Hiram Hamilton in favour of the appellant and consented to by the respondent Louise H. Hamilton. By this instrument the first named respondent, described as \"lessor,\" doth \"hereby lease exclusively\" to the appellant, described as \"lessee,\" all the land of the lessor \"for the purpose of drilling and operating for, producing and storing oil, gas and casing-head gas, laying and maintaining pipe lines, erecting and maintaining tanks, power stations, telegraph, telephone and power lines and all structures thereon necessary or useful to test for, drill for, produce, save, treat, store, transport and take care of such products and for housing and boarding employees,\" to be held by the lessee for ten years, renewable for successive terms of ten years so long as gas or oil is being produced or prospected for on the lands. The instrument provides for an annual rent to be paid on an acreage basis, as well as for a royalty on all oil and gas produced. It is also stipulated that the lessee shall use only the portion of the lands required for its operations and shall pay damages caused by such operations to growing crops.\nSubsequently, on or about October 27, 1950, the respondents entered into an oil and natural gas lease with other parties in consideration of a cash payment of $10,000, and undertook with these parties to commence proceedings to rid their title of the lease granted to the appellant on the alleged ground of non-compliance, in the taking of the appellant's lease, with the provisions of The Dower Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 206. In the present proceedings the respondents therefore claimed that the appellant's lease was void for non-compliance with s. 7 (1) of the statute, in that, as alleged, the consent of the respondent Louise Hamilton was not acknowledged \"apart\" from her husband within the meaning of that section. No fraud or overreaching on the part of the appellant is suggested, it being admitted in fact that the consent of the wife was given of her own free will and accord and without any compulsion on the part of the husband, which, of course, is alone the object of the statute.\nThe respondents adduced evidence that when the lease was executed and the consent of the respondent wife given, the husband and wife were together. The witness Lamar, who had obtained the lease on behalf of the appellant and before whom the acknowledgment was made, was unable to remember the particular circumstances. He testified that he had taken similar documents covering some 2,000,000 acres of land and that it was impossible for him to remember the circumstances of each case. He said, however, that he knew the requirements of the statute at the time, that he understood that \"apart\" meant \"out of sight\" and \"out of hearing\" and that it was his invariable practice to take the acknowledgment of a wife in accordance with these requirements. The learned judge, however, accepted the evidence for the respondents, and in the view he entertained of the statutory provisions, set aside the lease.\nOn appeal the court was equally divided. Parlee and Macdonald JJ.A. agreed with the learned trial judge, while Frank Ford J.A. and Clinton Ford J.A. would have allowed the appeal on the ground that the learned trial judge did not give effect to the onus which, in their opinion, rested on the respondents to prove that the acknowledgment of the consent by the respondent wife was not made \"apart.\" Frank Ford J.A., the only member of the court to mention the section, was also of opinion that s. 9(1) of the statute could not be availed of by the appellant as, in his opinion, the section applies only to contracts for the sale of land \"which are to be and can be followed by transfers capable of registration as transfers of the interest coming within the description required for purposes of registration.\" The learned judge appears to have assumed that the instrument here in question was not of such a character.\nThe relevant sections of the statute are as follows:\n2. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,\u2014\n(a) \"Disposition\" means any disposition by act inter vivos which is required to be executed by the owner of the land disposed of, and includes every transfer, agreement of sale, lease or other instrument intended to convey or transfer any interest in land and every mortgage or incumbrance intended to charge land with the payment of a sum of money (and requiring to be so executed) and every devise or other disposition made by will; and includes every mortgage by deposit of certificate of title or other mortgage not requiring the execution of any document;\n3. Every disposition by act inter vivos of the homestead of any married man whereby the interest of the married man shall or may vest in any other person at any time during the life of the married man or during the life of the married man's wife living at the date of the disposition, shall be absolutely null and void for all purposes unless made with the consent in writing of the wife.\n7. (1) When a wife executes any instrument concerning any disposition or consent under this Act she shall acknowledge it, apart from her husband, to have been executed by her of her own free will and accord and without any compulsion on the part of her husband.\n9. (1) When any woman has executed a contract for the sale of property, or joined in the execution thereof with her husband, or given her consent in writing to the execution thereof, and the consideration under the contract has been totally or partly performed by the purchaser, she shall, in the absence of fraud on the part of the purchaser, be deemed to have consented to the sale, in accordance with the provisions of this Act. (2) When any subsequent disposition by way of transfer of the property is presented for registration under The Land Titles Act, the consent previously given, or the agreement executed, shall, if produced and filed with the Registrar be sufficient for the purposes of this Act.\nWith respect to s. 9 (1), the first question which arises is as to whether or not the instrument here in question is \"a contract for the sale of property.\" That a lease is a contract which includes a demise is perfectly clear; Hill & Redman, 10th edition, p. 1; Whitehall Court Ltd. v. Ettlinger 8, per Lord Reading C.J. at 687. In my opinion, the lease to the appellant is a \"contract for the sale of property.\" In Joggins Coal Company v. Minister of National Revenue 9, we had occasion to apply to the facts of that case the statement of Lord Cairns in the course of his judgment in Gowan v. Christie 10 :\n\u2026 for although we speak of a mineral lease, or a lease of mines, the contract is not in reality, a lease at all in the sense in which we speak of an agricultural lease \u2026 What we call a mineral lease is really, when properly considered, a sale out and out of a portion of land. It is liberty given to a particular individual, for a specific length of time, to go into and under the land, and to get certain things there if he can find them, and to take them away, just as if he had bought so much of the soil.\nIn Re Aldam's Settled Estate 11, Collins M.R. expressed a similar view at p. 56 :\n\u2026 mining lease, which is really in its essence rather a sale at a price payable by instalments than a demise properly so called.\nAt p. 58, Stirling L.J. said:\nThe rent reserved by a mining lease rather resembles an instalment of purchase-money for the demised minerals than what is understood by rent reserved on an ordinary demise of the surface.\nCozens-Hardy L.J., at p. 63, said:\nThe use of the word \"rent\" in the case of a mining lease is somewhat misleading. It is really purchase-money for coal worked \u2026\nIn Gowan's case the lease was of \"the freestone and minerals \u2026 lying in and under\" certain lands \"with power . to search for, work and carry away\" the same at a rent of \u00a3200 per annum. As already pointed out, the instrument here in question is a demise of the whole quarter-section for the purpose of producing oil and gas, with a covenant on the part of the appellant to use only such portion thereof as may be necessary for its operations. Whether the proper construction of the instrument is that, with respect to minerals, it is a grant of the minerals as land, as in Gowan's case, or a demise of the surface to which is super-added a profit \u00e0 prendre, the result is, in my opinion, the same. The instrument provides for the sale of property, and under the first subsection, there being an absence of fraud on the part of the purchaser, the respondent wife is \"deemed\" to have consented to the sale \"in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\"\nIn my opinion, the words quoted can only mean in this statute \"taken to have so consented whether or not she did so in fact\"; Lawrence & Sons v. Willcocks 12, per Lord Esher and Lopes L.J. at 699 and 701 respectively. In the language of Fry L.J. in the same case at 700:\nWe are bound to give the words of the section their natural meaning unless some absurdity or injustice arises.\nSee also Shepheard v. Broome 13.\nIn my view, the language under consideration would be meaningless unless so construed, as the mere production of the instrument would entitle it to be accepted prima facie for what it is. It is only if fraud be shown that that defence is left open to a wife.\nI do not think, with respect, that subsection (2) of s. 9 affects this conclusion. That subsection merely provides that \"when\" any subsequent transfer is presented for registration, the consent already given to the contract for sale is sufficient and no consent is necessary to the transfer itself, as would be the case under s. 3 but for the provisions of subsection (2) of s. 9. I do not think that the subsection goes any farther than this or restricts the meaning of the word \"contracts\" in subsection (1). It is therefore not necessary to consider whether or not the interest covered by the instrument here in question could be the subject of a \"transfer\" under the statute.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout.\nEstey J. :\u2014The respondent Hiram Hamilton, under date of March 9, 1947, entered into an oil and gas mining lease under which he leased to the appellant the \"North West Quarter of Section Twenty-five (25) Township Forty-eight (48) Range Twenty-seven (27) West of the Fourth Meridian in the Province of Alberta containing 158 acres, more or less, \u2026 for the purpose of drilling and operating for, producing and storing oil, gas and casing-head gas, \u2026 for a space of ten (10) years from the date hereof, renewable and to be renewed for successive terms of ten (10) years \u2026 for so long as gas, oil, \u2026 are being produced from the said lands \u2026\" The respondent Louise H. Hamilton is the wife of the said Hiram Hamilton. The appellant registered a caveat as No. 7503, notice of which the Registrar, under date of April 19, 1947, forwarded to Hiram Hamilton. On January 6, 1951, it commenced this action asking a declaration that the lease is valid and subsisting and that caveat No. 7503 be continued, or, in the alternative, judgment against the respondent for the rentals paid in the sum of $948 with interest at 5 per cent.\nThe appellant drilled a well in accordance with the terms of the lease which turned out to be a \"dry hole\" and paid to the respondent Hiram Hamilton the sums payable in accordance with the terms of the lease from 1947 to September, 1950, in the sum of $948.\nThe respondents admit the foregoing, but contend that the said oil and gas mining lease was null and void and, therefore, they had a right to enter into a further and more advantageous agreement with another party in 1950. This contention is based upon the provisions of an act respecting the interests of a wife in her husband's homestead and cited as The Dower Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 206.\nThe above-described quarter section is the homestead of the respondent Hiram Hamilton within the meaning of The Dower Act and the contract is a \"disposition by act inter vivos of the homestead\" within the meaning of s. 3 thereof.\nThe Dower Act was passed for the purpose of protecting the wife against a disposition by her husband of the homestead without her consent. The Legislature, in order to ensure the consent would be voluntary on the part of the wife and, therefore, without any undue influence or compulsion on the part of her husband, has provided she must acknowledge this consent, in the manner required by s. 7(1), before a party duly appointed to take proof of the execution of instruments under The Land Titles Act (s. 7(2)). The relevant portions of s. 3 read:\n3. Every disposition by act inter vivos of the homestead of any married man \u2026 shall be absolutely null and void for all purposes unless made with the consent in writing of the wife. Then in s. 7 the Legislature specifies how this consent shall be acknowledged. The relevant portions of s. 7 read:\n7. (1) When a wife executes any \u2026 consent under this Act she shall acknowledge it, apart from her husband, to have been executed by her of her own free will and accord and without any compulsion on the part of her husband.\n(2) The acknowledgment may be made before any person authorized to take proof of the execution of instruments under The Land Titles Act, and a certificate thereof in Form B shall be indorsed on or attached to the instrument executed by her.\nThese provisions are imperative and, therefore, only the consent made in compliance therewith is valid within the meaning of the enactment.\nMr. Lamar, on March 9, 1947, as agent for the appellant, called at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton and advised them that Mr. Hamilton was the owner of the mineral rights in the homestead, a fact which apparently neither he nor his wife had previously appreciated. Then followed a discussion which resulted in Mr. Hamilton's agreeing to give the lease here in question to the appellant. This discussion took place in the kitchen while the parties were seated around the kitchen table. It was there the lease was prepared and executed as well as Mrs. Hamilton's consent and her acknowledgment. Throughout, all three parties took part in the discussion and it is clear that Mrs. Hamilton appreciated all that was there taking place. Mr. Hamilton also heard and understood all that took place. The acknowledgment of Mrs. Hamilton's consent was taken while the parties remained seated around the table. Whatever the precise meaning of the phrase \"apart from her husband\" may be, an acknowledgment taken in the presence and hearing of the husband, as in this case, is not a compliance with s. 7 and, therefore, the disposition by way of the oil and gas mining lease between the parties hereto under the terms of s. 3 is \"absolutely null and void for all purposes\" unless it comes within the exception contained in s. 9(1) to be hereinafter discussed.\nIn arriving at the foregoing conclusion, I have not overlooked the view expressed by some of the learned judges in the Appellate Division that in taking Mrs. Hamilton's acknowledgment, Lamar was acting in an official capacity, and that the presumption that in doing so he acted in a regular and proper manner has not been rebutted by the evidence here adduced. The force of this presumption is explained in Taylor on Evidence, 12th Ed., p. 105:\nIn this mode the law \u2026 defines the nature and amount of the ' evidence which is sufficient to establish a prima facie case, and to throw the burthen of proof on the other party; and if no opposing evidence is offered, the jury are bound to find in favour of the presumption.\nSuch is a rebuttable presumption. Am. & Eng. Encyc. of Law, 22, 2nd Ed., p. 1266; Broom's Legal Maxims, 10th Ed., p. 642. In this case Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton and an independent witness deposed to facts that clearly establish that Lamar did not properly perform his official duties in the taking of Mrs. Hamilton's acknowledgment. Lamar himself had no recollection of the occasion and went no further than to state that he always took such acknowledgments separate and apart from the husband. The learned trial judge, referring to this evidence, stated that Lamar's \"evidence does not assist in making any definite finding. I accept the evidence of Hamilton and his wife in preference to Lamar.\" He had previously accepted the evidence of the independent witness who corroborated Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton.\nThe position, therefore, is quite different from that in Jackson v. Chabillon 14, where at p. 615 the learned trial judge came to the conclusion\nIn my view the evidence is not sufficiently impressive to rebut the presumption in favour of the proper execution of the mortgage as well as compliance with the requirements of The Dower Act \u2026\nIn these circumstances I agree with Mr. Justice Parlee with whom Mr. Justice W. A. Macdonald agreed, that any presumption in favour of the regularity of official acts is rebutted when, as here, the trial judge accepts the evidence of the wife, her husband, and that of an independent witness, all of whom depose that the acknowledgment was made in a manner contrary to the statute.\nThe appellant contends that notwithstanding the foregoing, the oil and gas lease here in question is a valid \"contract for the sale of property\" by virtue of the provisions of s. 9(1), the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n9. (1) When any woman has executed a contract for the sale of property \u2026 or given her consent in writing to the execution thereof, and the consideration under the contract has been totally or partly performed by the purchaser, she shall, in the absence of fraud on the part of the purchaser, be deemed to have consented to the sale, in accordance with the provisions of this Act. There is no suggestion of fraud on the part of Mr. Lamar and it is clear that he was a party authorized to take the acknowledgment.\nThe provisions of s. 9 would make valid \"a contract for the sale of property\" where the consideration, as here, has been partially performed and where the consent in writing by the wife has not been acknowledged separate and apart from her husband. Its provisions, therefore, constitute an exception to the requirements of s. 7, enacted for the protection of the wife, and ought not to be given a wider application than that which is clearly intended by the Legislature as expressed in the language there adopted.\nIt is the contention of the respondents that the phrase \"a contract for the sale of property\" ought not to be construed to include the oil and gas mining lease here in question. As ordinarily used and understood, the word \"sale\" in such a phrase would not include a lease. It is, however, pointed out that Lord Cairns in Gowan v. Christie 15, at 284, stated :\n\u2026 a mineral lease is really, when properly considered, a sale out and out of a portion of land.\nLord Cairns is here again stressing that it is not the name or words by which the parties describe their contract, but rather the substance thereof, as determined from a study of its provisions, that determines its true nature and character. The contract here in question, though styled a lease, gives to the appellant the exclusive right to search for oil and gas and, if found, then, by virtue of the renewal clauses, to take possession thereof until such time as the supply is exhausted. If the contract had provided but a right to search that would have created but a licence or privilege which would not have constituted an interest in land. The contract, however, goes further and gives the additional right to take the gas and oil as and when found, which, until it is removed, is a part of the soil and passes with the fee. This contract, therefore, gives to the appellant the right to take a part of the soil and is a profit \u00e0 prendre, which, in itself, is an interest in land. 11 Hals., 2nd Ed., 387, para. 680; McIntosh v. Leckie 16; Canadian Ry. Accident Co. v. Williams 17. The agreement or contract for the sale of a homestead or other parcel of land is a well known instrument in Alberta. When, therefore, in the phrase \"a contract for the sale of property\" in s. 9(1) the Legislature used the general word \"property,\" rather than \"homestead\" as in s. 3, it disclosed an intention that the provisions of s. 9(1) should apply in a manner other than to the homestead as a whole and has used language sufficiently comprehensive to include, not only a portion of its acreage, but also some interest in the land or soil constituting the homestead.\nThe respondents contend that when sub-sees. 9(1) and 9(2) are read together the words \"a contract for the sale of property\" in sub-sec. 9(1) must be construed to refer only to a contract to be followed by a transfer registerable under The Land Titles Act.\u2026Sub-sec. 9(2) reads as follows:\n9. (2) When any subsequent disposition by way of transfer of the property is presented for registration under The Land Titles Act, the consent previously given, or the agreement executed, shall, if produced and filed with the Registrar be sufficient for the purposes of this Act.\nSub-section 9(2) is restricted in its application to transfers registerable under The Land Titles Act. A construction of the phrase \"a contract for the sale of property,\" as used in sub-sec. 9(1), that would limit it to contracts which contemplate, when carried out, the delivery and registration of a transfer under The Land Titles Act, would be to add words that the Legislature has not seen fit to insert. It is the duty of the court to interpret rather than to legislate and, therefore, to give effect to the language adopted. Blyth v. Lord Advocate 18. The words \"a contract for the sale of property\" in sub-sec. 9(1) are sufficiently wide and comprehensive to include contracts for the sale of property generally and to include one such as here under consideration where it is not contemplated that a transfer under The Land Titles Act will be issued.\nNo particular words are required in order to create a profit \u00e0 prendre and where, as here, the contract gives to the appellant the exclusive dominion and control and the right to take all the gas and oil, then, even if the word \"grant\" be not found in the contract, it will be so construed. 11 Hals., 2nd Ed., 388, para. 684, and cases already cited. It follows that the provisions of the oil and gas lease here in question constitute a sale of profit \u00e0 prendre, or an interest in land, and, notwithstanding that her consent was not acknowledged by Mrs. Hamilton apart from her husband, is a valid \"contract for the sale of property\" by virtue of the provisions in sub-sec. 9(1).\nThe appeal should be allowed and judgment entered that the lease is a good, valid and subsisting \"contract for the sale of property\" and that caveat No. 7503, registered against the land on the sixteenth day of April, 1947, should be continued. The appellant should have its costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Macleod, Riley, Bessemer & Dixon.\nSolicitors for respondents: Duncan, Johnson, Miskew, Dechene, Bishop & Blackstock.\n1 (1952) 5 W.W.R.

It was established that while the appellant was extracting a number of teeth under a general anaesthetic the patient collapsed and died from asphyxia. It was argued on behalf of the appellant that it had not been shown that one of the gauze sponges used in the operation had lodged in the windpipe during that operation, or that death was caused by that obstruction, and that even if the cause of death be taken as established, no negligence on the part of the appellant had been shown.\nHeld: That ordinary care and prudence had not been shown by the appellant in overlooking the fact\u2014especially as no count of the sponges was kept\u2014that a sponge in the windpipe might have been the cause of the patient ceasing to breathe and in making no effort to ascertain this, other than looking into the patient\u2019s mouth, and consequently making no attempt to remove the obstruction. The appellant therefore must be held to have been negligent. Held: also, that sufficient was shown by the evidence to call upon the appellant for an explanation. Res ipsa loquitur is not a doctrine but \u201cThe rule is a special case within the broader doctrine that courts act and are entitled to act upon the weight of the balance of probabilities\u201d. The Sisters of St. Joseph of the Diocese of London v. Fleming [1938] S.C.R. 172 at 177. The rule may apply in malpractice cases depending upon the circumstances and it applied here. Clark v. Wansbrough [1940] O.W.N. 67 over-ruled.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] setting aside the judgment of Aylen J. who dismissed the action, and fixing the amount of damages under The Fatal Accidents Act at $2,000 each for the widow and two children.\nGordon Watson, Q.C. for the appellant.\nMichael Fram and Lionel Choquette, Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice, Kerwin, Estey and Cartwright, JJ. was delivered by:\nKERWIN J.:\u2014Lee Robert Holt died in the office of a dentist, the appellant Dr. Percy L. Nesbitt, and this action is brought by the widow and administratrix of the deceased against the appellant to recover damages for the death of her husband. No evidence was led on behalf of the appellant at the trial so that the circumstances surrounding the death are found in the evidence of Detective Simms, who related the details as told to him by the appellant, and in extracts from the examination for discovery of the appellant put in by the respondent at the trial. On this evidence the facts are as follows.\nThe appellant had extracted ten out of an intended total of twelve or fourteen of Holt\u2019s teeth while the patient was under a general anaesthetic of nitrous oxide and oxygen. The appellant noticed Holt changing colour so he changed from the mixture to straight oxygen and Holt seemed to revive. The appellant was going to recommence the pulling of teeth when he noticed that Holt had relapsed so he and his assistant took Holt out of the chair, put him on the floor, and applied artificial respiration. The appellant said that a number of pieces of gauze called sponges had been placed in the patient\u2019s mouth and that he removed the last of these. However, he also said that this was torn but in the evidence of the pathologist Dr. Klotz, who testified at the trial, it appears that another one must have been overlooked as it was found by Dr. Klotz in the trachea, folded but moulded to the shape of the trachea. This sponge was found to be intact and not torn. There appears to be no doubt, on the evidence, that the appellant kept no count of the sponges he inserted in Holt\u2019s mouth.\nIt was argued that Holt had died either of shock or of asphyxia caused by the gauze in the trachea and that it was not shown that the sponge lodged in the patient\u2019s trachea during the operation and that his death was caused by that obstruction. I agree with the Court of Appeal[2] that this contention cannot prevail. While an effort was made in the cross-examination of Dr. Klotz to show that death might have been caused by shock since the head of the deceased was not opened, Dr. Klotz adhered to the opinion he had expressed in direct examination that Holt had died of asphyxia caused by the sponge in the trachea. It would appear that the trial judge had the same view.\nIt was then argued that even if the cause of death be taken as established, no negligence on the part of the appellant has been shown. I agree with Hogg J.A. \u201cthat ordinary care and prudence was not shown by the respondent in his overlooking the fact\u2014especially as there is the evidence that no count of the sponges was kept\u2014that a sponge in Holt\u2019s windpipe might be the cause of his ceasing to breathe and in making no effort to ascertain whether this was the case other than looking into the patient\u2019s mouth, and as a consequence in making no attempt to remove the obstruction which terminated Holt\u2019s life. I think the respondent must be held to have been negligent.\u201d I also agree with all the members of the Court of Appeal that sufficient was shown by the evidence to call upon the appellant for an explanation. No issue is raised as to the competency of the appellant or as to the carrying out of the operation of pulling teeth. What is complained of is that anyone, even without the appellant\u2019s training, knowledge and experience, would have checked the sponges, and that when he noticed the patient turning pale, he would have looked to see if all the sponges were accounted for. I have read all the reported cases in England and Canada on the subject which were referred to in the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal or by counsel on the argument and, in addition, decisions in other jurisdictions. It is unnecessary to refer to them except to say it is impossible to agree with the statement of McTague J.A., sitting as a trial judge, in Clark v. Wansbrough[3] that \u201cThe doctrine res ipsa loquitur, no matter how ingeniously put, has no application in malpractice cases.\u201d Res ipsa loquitur is not a doctrine but \u201cThe rule is a special case within the broader doctrine that courts act and are entitled to act upon the weight of the balance of probabilities.\u201d The Sisters of St. Joseph of the Diocese of London v. Fleming[4]. It may apply in malpractice cases depending upon the circumstances and for the reasons already given, it applies here.\nCounsel for the appellant did not question the amount at which the damages had been fixed in the Court below and the appeal should therefore be dismissed with costs.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014In their reasons for judgment delivered in the Court of Appeal Mr. Justice Laidlaw has found that in the circumstances disclosed by the evidence the respondent was entitled to invoke the rule res ipsa loquitur, while Mr. Justice Hogg has expressed the view that there was affirmative evidence of negligence upon which the appellant should have been found liable. I respectfully agree with both of these conclusions.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: S.C.

Cowper [1951] S.C.R. 450), and it was impossible to say in the present case that the mere happening of the occurrence gave rise to a presumption that it had been caused by very great negligence.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , affirming, O'Halloran J.A. dissenting, the dismissal of an action for injuries suffered by the appellant as gratuitous passenger in an automobile.\nAlfred Bull Q.C. for the appellant.\nDouglas McK. Brown for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKERWIN J.:\u2014The appellant was a gratuitous passenger in an automobile owned by the respondent and driven by one Brentzen from Nanaimo northerly towards Port Alberni in the province of British Columbia. About fifteen miles from Nanaimo the car rammed a concrete abutment of a highway bridge on the west side of the road. Brentzen and another passenger were killed while a third passenger was so badly injured that he remembers nothing of the accident. The appellant had fallen asleep when the car was about seven miles out of Nanaimo and he does not know what happened. He was seriously injured and brought the present action to recover damages for such injuries. By virtue of section 81 of the British Columbia Motor Vehicles Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, chapter 227, the respondent is liable for such damages if it can be shown that Brentzen was grossly negligent as provided by section 82 of the Act :\u2014\n82. No action shall lie against either the owner or the driver of a motor vehicle\u2026 by a person who is carried as a passenger\u2026 for any injury, loss or damage sustained by such person, or for the death of such person by reason of the operation of that motor vehicle\u2026 while such person is a passenger\u2026 unless there has been gross negligence on the part of the driver of the vehicle and unless such gross negligence contributed to the injury, loss or damage in respect of which the action is brought\u2026\nThe trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal[2] decided that the appellant had failed to show such gross negligence. I can find nothing to suggest, as is intimated in the reasons of the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal, that the case proceeded on the basis that gross negligence is not shown unless it is proven conclusively as if it were a prosecution for criminal negligence in a criminal Court and, in any event, I do not proceed on any such basis. This, of course, is a civil case but it is one where something more than negligence must appear. As was held by this Court in Studer v. Cowper[3], this means there must have been very great negligence. Without referring to any of the decisions where the maxim res ipsa was applied in cases of claims for damages caused by the operation of a motor car, it is impossible, in my view, to say that the mere happening of the occurrence in the present case gives rise to a presumption that it was caused by very great negligence on the part of Brentzen.\nIt was argued that the proper inferences from the evidence are that he had no sleep the night before, and that starting out from Nanaimo about seven o'clock in the morning of a November day he had fallen asleep at the wheel. I cannot read the evidence as indicating either of these things, which in my view are mere suppositions. It is further said that the marks on the left shoulder of the road indicate that the automobile must have been driven from the right to the left side of the centrally paved portion of the highway, because there are tire marks showing that for 66 feet the car proceeded along the shoulder and into the concrete abutment. However, these circumstances do not indicate what caused the auto to go from the right to the left side of the road. There was a governor on the car which precluded a speed exceeding forty miles per hour. We know nothing of what the actual speed was but, even if it were much lower than that permitted, it would not take long to cover the 66 feet.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bull, Houser, Tupper, Ray, Guy & Merritt.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

The judgment held that the accident was mainly due to the defective condition of the brakes on the truck. The driver was found liable because he had been negligent; the respondent corporation, because it was the employer of the driver; and the respondent Masoud, because he was paying the driver's salary and had allowed the use by the corporation of the defective truck. The respondent Masoud had only a few days previous to the accident purchased the truck from the appellant.\nContemporaneously with the filing of their plea in the action, the respondents, but not the driver, took action in warranty with the customary conclusions against the appellant who did not intervene in the principal action but denied liability in warranty. The judgment in the warranty action dismissed the corporation's action and maintained Masoud's\n[page 150]\nfor one half. Appeals were entered by all the parties of the warranty action, and the majority in the Court of Queen's Bench for Quebec maintained the appeals of the respondents.\nHeld, that the appeal as against the respondent Masoud should be dismissed, in view of the legal warranty against latent defects which arose on the sale of the truck (1527 C.C.).\nHeld also (Rinfret C.J. and Rand J. dissenting), that the appeal as to the respondent corporation should be dismissed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, maintaining, St. Germain J.A. dissenting, the appeals of the respondents in an action in warranty against a used car dealer.\nA. Laurendeau, Q.C., for the appellant.\nA. J. Campbell, Q.C., for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting) : In this case, a truck driver, Picard, employed by the Montreal Candy Manufacturing Co. Limited, was found liable on account of his personal negligence, for an accident, as a result of which he was sued together with his employer, the Candy Company, and one Sam Masoud, the owner of the truck.\nThe trial judge, in his judgment, held that the degree of responsibility of Picard amounted to ten per cent of the damages incurred; that the Candy Company was responsible under Art. 1054 of the Code, as the employer of Picard; and that Masoud, as owner of the truck, was responsible because he had put into circulation a vehicle with defective brakes. The learned judge attributed to this defect the main cause of the accident.\nThere was no appeal from that judgment and, therefore, it is from those findings at the trial that we must proceed to determine the decision which has to be rendered in the matter now submitted to this Court.\nThis matter is an action in warranty brought by both the Candy Company and Masoud against Modern Motor Sales Co. Limited, the present appellant, which sold the truck to Masoud.\nBoth the Courts below found the appellant guilty in having sold the defective truck, but the question on the appeal is whether, on that ground, it should be held responsible in warranty towards both Masoud, the purchaser of the truck, and the Candy Company.\n[page 151]\nNo doubt can be expressed as to the responsibility in warranty of the appellant towards Masoud on account of the contractual relation which resulted from the sale to him.\nBut, a different consideration arises with regard to the action in warranty of the Candy Company. No contractual relationship existed or exists betwen the appellant and the Candy Company.\nMoreover, the Candy Company was not found responsible for the damages caused on the ground that they were making use of a defective truck; the ground of their responsibility was exclusively the fact that they were the employer of the driver Picard. It is, therefore, on account of the personal negligence of their employee. With that point, the appellant is in no way concerned and there exists no connection between that ground of liability and the fact that they sold a defective truck to Masoud.\nIt is significant that the trial judge himself, when disposing at the same time of the principal action and of the actions in warranty dismissed the action in warranty of the Candy Company against the appellant.\nI agree with Rand J. that while the appeal of Modern Motor Sales Co. Limited fails as against Masoud, it is well founded as against the Candy Company and to that extent the judgment appealed from should be reversed.\nThe quotation made by my Brother Rand, in his reasons for judgment, and taken from \"Les Pandectes Fran\u00e7aises, Nouveau R\u00e9pertoire, Tome 34, p. 36 et seq., nos 49 et 54\" seems to me to be absolutely in point. The appellant, to my mind, cannot be called upon to warrant either Picard or the Candy Company against their liability resulting from the negligence of Picard. The action in warranty of the Candy Company should, therefore, be dismissed.\nIt strikes me, however, that from the practical point of view such a result is really not very material.\nMasoud was condemned to pay the full amount of the damages (less ten per cent attributable to the negligence of the driver Picard). As the warrantor of Masoud, the appellant will, therefore, be called upon to pay all the damages, less ten per cent, and in turn, of course, Masoud will hand over to the plaintiff in the main action the sum of money thus received from the appellant.\n[page 152]\nIf the Candy Company had succeeded in its action in warranty against the appellant, the latter would not have been obliged to pay any more. The sum which it will pay to Masoud is exactly the same as that it would have paid to the company. It would be one and the same amount; and when the plaintiff in the main action receives that amount from Masoud, he will become completely disinterested. The Candy Company will only have to pay to the main plaintiff the ten per cent for which Picard was found responsible on account of his personal negligence.\nThe whole matter, so far as the Candy Company is concerned, resolves itself into a question of costs. Its action in warranty against the appellant being dismissed by the present judgment, it will have, of course, to pay the costs of the appellant in this Court; but, as the appellant fails so far as Masoud is concerned, I would agree with my Brother Rand that the appellant should be entitled to recover only one-third of its costs in this Court as against the Candy Company, and that there should be no costs as between the Candy Company and the appellant in the Court of King's Bench.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau, J. :\u2014Le 29 octobre 1940, M.

Les trois d\u00e9fendeurs, poursuivis conjointement et solidairement, ont pr\u00e9tendu qu'ils n'\u00e9taient pas responsables de cet accident qui serait attribuable au fait que les freins du camion n'ont pas fonctionn\u00e9 quand le chauffeur Picard a voulu les appliquer.\n[page 153]\nLe 4 avril 1941, Masoud et la Montreal Candy Manufacturing Co. Ltd, mais non Picard, ont institu\u00e9 une action en garantie contre la Modern Motor Sales Ltd, disant en substance qu'ils ont contest\u00e9 l'action principale, qu'ils ont ni\u00e9 toute responsabilit\u00e9, que le camion avait \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9 par Masoud de Modern Motor Sales Ltd, et que l'accident, dont la faute ne peut \u00eatre imput\u00e9e aux d\u00e9fendeurs, est enti\u00e8rement d\u00fb au fait que les freins du camion vendu \u00e9taient dans une condition d\u00e9fectueuse, un fait qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre connu par la Modern Motor Sales Ltd, et que cet \u00e9tat des freins constituait un d\u00e9faut cach\u00e9. La conclusion de cette action en garantie est que la Modern Motor Sales Ltd, soit condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 indemniser les demandeurs en garantie, Masoud et la Montreal Candy Manufacturing Co. Ltd, de toute condamnation qui pourrait \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e contre eux.\nL'honorable Juge Surveyer de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, devant qui se sont instruites en m\u00eame temps, et l'action principale et l'action en garantie, a condamn\u00e9 sur l'action principale les trois d\u00e9fendeurs Masoud, Montreal Candy Manufacturing Co. Ltd. et Picard, conjointement et solidairement, \u00e0 la somme de $3,893.00 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats et d\u00e9pens. Il en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que Picard avait \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gligent dans la conduite de l'automobile, que la Montreal Candy Manufacturing Co. Ltd. \u00e9tait l'employeur de Picard, et que Masoud devait \u00e9galement \u00eatre tenu responsable parce qu'il payait Picard, et aussi parce qu'il avait remis \u00e0 la Montreal Candy Manufacturing Co. Ltd. un camion dont les freins \u00e9taient dans un \u00e9tat d\u00e9fectueux.\nSur l'action en garantie, l'honorabe Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a rejet\u00e9 la r\u00e9clamation de Montreal Candy sans frais, et il a condamn\u00e9 la Modern Motor Sales Ltd. \u00e0 payer \u00e0 Masoud la somme de $1,946.50 \u00e9tant la moiti\u00e9 des dommages accord\u00e9s \u00e0 Rosenthal, le tout avec d\u00e9pens.\nLes motifs de ce jugement sont que la d\u00e9fenderesse en garantie, Modern Motor Sales Ltd., \u00e9tant un commer\u00e7ant habituel d'automobiles usag\u00e9s, doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conna\u00eetre les d\u00e9fauts de la chose qu'elle vend. L'accident serait presque compl\u00e8tement sinon exclusivement d\u00fb au fait que les freins \u00e9taient dans une condition d\u00e9fectueuse, et comme le Juge arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que Masoud et la Modern Motor Sales Ltd. sont en faute, le d\u00e9fendeur en\n[page 154]\ngarantie doit cons\u00e9quemment rembourser \u00e0 Masoud, demandeur en garantie, la moiti\u00e9 de la condamnation sur l'action principale, soit $1,946.50.\nPersonne n'a interjet\u00e9 appel du jugement sur l'action principale, mais Masoud et Montreal Candy ont tous deux appel\u00e9 du jugement sur l'action en garantie. Modern Motor Sales a \u00e9galement log\u00e9 un contre-appel. La Cour du Banc de la Reine 2, M. le Juge St-Germain \u00e9tant dissident, a rejet\u00e9 l'appel de Modern Motor Sales Ltd., mais, les appels de Masoud et de Montreal Candy ont \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenus parce que la condition d\u00e9fectueuse des freins constituait au moment de la livraison du camion un d\u00e9faut cach\u00e9 suivant les dispositions de l'article 1522 C.C. pour laquelle la Modern Motor Sales Ltd. doit \u00eatre tenue responsable en vertu des dispositions de l'article 1527 C.C. Masoud avait le droit de s'attendre \u00e0 ce que le camion ait \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 d'une fa\u00e7on prudente et, suivant la preuve, la Modern Motor Sales Ltd. n'a pas rempli ce devoir qui lui \u00e9tait impos\u00e9. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que cette faute donnait ouverture \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation en garantie d\u00e9 la part de Montreal Candy.\nLa signification du jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine est donc \u00e0 l'effet que la seule partie responsable de cet accident est la Modern Motor Sales comme cons\u00e9quence de la condition d\u00e9fectueuse des freins, et que l'action principale ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue, l'action en garantie doit l'\u00eatre \u00e9galement, parce que le d\u00e9fendeur en garantie, n'\u00e9tant pas intervenu \u00e0 l'action principale, ne peut contester le jugement rendu sur icelle.\nL'appelant soumet en premier lieu que l'action en garantie contre la Modern Motor Sales ne peut r\u00e9ussir, que cette Compagnie soit responsable ou non de cet accident. Si elle n'est pas responsable, il ne peut y avoir de condamnation prononc\u00e9e contre elle; si, d'autre part, elle est seule responsable, elle aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre poursuivie directement par la victime, et comme il n'existait aucun recours contre les d\u00e9fendeurs principaux, l'action institu\u00e9e contre eux aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Ceci aurait \u00e9galement dispos\u00e9 de l'action en garantie.\nCe raisonnement ne manque pas de logique, mais il p\u00e8che en ce sens que l'action de Rosenthal, demandeur principal,\n[page 155]\na \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue contre les trois d\u00e9fendeurs principaux, Picard, Masoud et Montreal Candy, conjointement et solidairement, pour la somme de $3,893.00 et de ce jugement il n'y a pas eu d'appel. Comme le fait remarquer la Cour du Banc de la Reine, la Modern Motor Sales n'est pas intervenue pour contester l'action principale, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e en garantie, et il en r\u00e9sulte qu'elle ne peut aujourd'hui soulever devant les tribunaux la validit\u00e9 de ce premier jugement, et pr\u00e9tendre qu'il est erron\u00e9. Entre l'appelante et les d\u00e9fendeurs principaux, le jugement sur l'action principale est inattaquable. Le seul droit du d\u00e9fendeur en garantie qui n'est pas intervenu est d'essayer d'\u00e9tablir qu'il n'y a pas lieu \u00e0 garantie de sa part.\nDans Meilleur v. Montreal Light Heat & Power Company et la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al 3, M. le Juge Martineau si\u00e9geant en revision, s'exprimait de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nLorsque le garant a \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9, que l'action principale comme l'action en garantie ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9unies, que l'action principale a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue ainsi que l'action en garantie, le garant ne peut, sur le seul appel du jugement qui le condamne \u00e0 indemniser le d\u00e9fendeur principal, le faire infirmer, parce que le jugement sur l'action principale serait erron\u00e9.\nDans Archibald v. Delisle 4, le Juge Taschereau parlant pour la Cour dit:\nBy the judgment against which the appellants, defendants in warranty, now appeal, they have been declared to be the warrantors of the plaintiffs in warranty. And as the plaintiffs on the principal action have appealed from the judgment dismissing their action, they might have obtained here a reversal of that judgment and obtained a condemnation against the defendants Delisle, plaintiffs in warranty. That condemnation would then have reflected on the appellants, defendants in warranty, as it is res judicata between them and the plaintiffs in warranty, so long as that judgment stands, that they are their warrantors against the condemnations on the principal action. (In what form, and by what means, the plaintiffs in warranty could then have obtained a judgment against the defendants in warranty we are here not concerned with.) It follows clearly that the appellants Baker et al., have an interest upon this appeal distinct and separate altogether from the condemnation to costs.\nCe sont ces principes que la Cour du Banc de la Reine a accept\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, et je m'accorde avec ses conclusions.\nIl r\u00e9sulte donc comme cons\u00e9quence du jugement de premi\u00e8re instance que Picard, Masoud et Montreal Candy sont conjointement et solidairement responsables de l'accident dont Rosenthal a \u00e9t\u00e9 la victime. J'entretiens des doutes\n[page 156]\ns\u00e9rieux sur l'existence de cette solidarit\u00e9 entre les trois d\u00e9fendeurs. En effet, elle ne pourrait exister que par l'application de l'article 1106 C.C. qui veut que l'obligation r\u00e9sultant d'un d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit commis par deux personnes ou plus, soit solidaire. Encore faut-il que les d\u00e9bile teurs aient commis un quasi-d\u00e9lit et que ce soit le m\u00eame quasi-d\u00e9lit. C'est \u00e0 cette seule condition qu'il y aura solidarit\u00e9. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, l'obligation de Picard, conducteur du v\u00e9hicule, de r\u00e9parer le dommage caus\u00e9, proc\u00e8de bien d'un quasi-d\u00e9lit, mais les sources qui font na\u00eetre les obligations de Masoud et de Montreal Candy sont enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rentes. La responsabilit\u00e9 de Montreal Candy, suivant le jugement du Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, na\u00eetrait de la relation d'employeur et d'employ\u00e9 (1054 C.C.). Elle aurait son fondement sur un texte de loi, et ne pr\u00e9senterait aucun caract\u00e8re quasi-d\u00e9lictuel. Masoud, qui payait Picard, serait responsable \u00e9galement comme cons\u00e9quence de l'application de l'article 1054, et il aurait aussi commis le quasi-d\u00e9lit de donner la possession d'un camion d\u00e9fectueux \u00e0 la Montreal Candy, ce qui l'obligerait \u00e0 r\u00e9parer le dommage en vertu de 1053. Quasi-d\u00e9lit bien diff\u00e9rent de celui de Picard.\nMais il semble inutile d'approfondir davantage cette question, car le premier jugement prononce la solidarit\u00e9 et vu le d\u00e9faut d'appel, il ne peut \u00eatre attaqu\u00e9. C'est tel qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu qu'il faut le consid\u00e9rer, et c'est de cette condamnation solidaire que l'appelante doit indemniser les intim\u00e9s, \u00e0 moins qu'elle n'en soit dispens\u00e9e pour quelque autre motif.\nIl faut donc prendre pour acquit, comme l'a trouv\u00e9 le Juge au proc\u00e8s, que la cause de cet accident est la d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9 des freins du camion achet\u00e9 par Masoud de rappelante. Cette derni\u00e8re est commer\u00e7ante en automobiles et camions usag\u00e9s, et comme telle, elle est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conna\u00eetre les d\u00e9fauts de la chose qu'elle vend; dans le cas de dommages subis comme r\u00e9sultat de ces vices, elle est tenue d'indemniser l'acheteur (C.C. 1527). La preuve d\u00e9montre surabondamment que le d\u00e9faut aux freins, cause de l'accident, \u00e9tait un vice cach\u00e9 et la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'appelante vis-\u00e0-vis de Masoud se trouve cons\u00e9quemment engag\u00e9e. Elle r\u00e9sulte de sa \"faute professionnelle\". \"Spondet peritiam artis\", et on peut ajouter avec Ulpien, \"Imperitia\n[page 157]\nculpae annumeratur\"'. Vide: Ross v. Dunstall et al 5; Samson v. Davie Shipbuilding & Repairing Co. 6; Guillouard, Vente, No. 463; Lajoie v. Robert 7; Touchette v. Pizzagalli 8.\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 de l'appelante vis-\u00e0-vis de Montreal Candy se pr\u00e9sente sous un aspect diff\u00e9rent. Il n'existe, pas entre les deux parties, comme dans le cas de Masoud, de relation d'acheteur et de vendeur, et c'est exclusivement sur l'article 1053 que doit reposer la r\u00e9clamation de la Compagnie. Par la faute de Modern Motor, la Montreal Candy a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue responsable d'un accident qui \u00e0 son tour lui a caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice, pour lequel elle a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9. Le vendeur d'un objet qui cause un dommage, engage sa responsabilit\u00e9, non seulement vis-\u00e0-vis l'acheteur, mais aussi vis-\u00e0-vis les usagers de cette chose, m\u00eame s'il n'existe aucune relation contractuelle. La faute est d\u00e9lictuelle, et c'est ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc de la Reine dans Drolet v. London Lancashire 9, jugement confirm\u00e9 par cette Cour, 10 et dans Ross v. Dunstall et al 11. Dans cette derni\u00e8re cause, Ross, manufacturier d'armes \u00e0 feu, a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu responsable d'accidents survenus non seulement \u00e0 l'acheteur imm\u00e9diat de la carabine, mais aussi \u00e0 celui qui en avait fait l'acquisition chez un marchand d\u00e9taillant aux \u00c9tats-Unis.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens, mais le jugement \u00e0 \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9 devra \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 et r\u00e9duit \u00e0 $3,503.70 vu le d\u00e9sistement partiel produit par les intim\u00e9s.\nRand J. (dissenting) : I think it clear that by the law of Quebec a person who is rendered liable in civil responsibility, as, for example, under article 1054 of the Code, by reason of damage caused by things, through an act, cause or condition which can be directly traced back to the fault of another, has a right against the latter to be indemnified against the consequences of that intermediate liability; and that that indemnity may be invoked by the procedure known as warranty. For this proposition it is sufficient to cite three authorities: McFarlane v. Dewey 12; Gosselin v. Martel 13; and Archibald v. Delisle 14.\n[page 158]\nIn the present case the owner of the truck, Masoud, the driver, Picard, and his employer, the Candy Company, have jointly and severally been found to be responsible for the damages caused. The liability of the driver arose from his personal negligence; but both courts agree that there was present also, as an operative cause, the dangerous condition of the truck resulting from a latent defect in its braking gear. Since that judgment has not been appealed, it stands as res judicata between the principal plaintiff and defendants.\nBoth courts agree also that the ultimate responsibility for the condition of the truck is that of the Motor Company, the defendant in warranty, and that a legal warranty against latent defects arose on the sale of the car. There seems to be some uncertainty in the judgments as to the precise basis of liability of the owner to the principal plaintiff, but that must be taken, I think, to arise from the presumption of article 1054 in relation to damage caused by a thing in his care. It is the owner, then, who, under the judgment as between the principal defendants, represents the fault ultimately traceable to the Motor Company. Of the total liability attributable to these two causes, that portion of it chargeable against the driver and vicariously to the Candy Company as his employer, results from the personal negligence of the driver and not from any act or default of the Motor Company.\nThe owner, so liable, has, under the rule stated, a right in the nature of indemnity against the Motor Company; but in view of the source of the judgment against the Candy Company, that principle cannot be invoked by the latter in the warranty action. The Candy Company as a principal defendant has a right of recourse against the owner for the percentage of responsibility attributable to the latter, but this is a matter of ultimate distribution of the loss, and it arises from the rule of contribution between persons found jointly liable for delictual conduct.\nIt is said that since the judgment against the Candy Company is for the total amount of the damages, it necessarily includes that portion ultimately chargeable against the Motor Company; and as establishing liability on the part of the Motor Company towards the Candy Company, that quantum is assimilated to damage caused the Candy\n[page 159]\nCompany by the Motor Company through a fault within article 1053. It is the fact that the Candy Company has been adjudged liable to the principal plaintiff in the total sum: and if the Motor Company has been a defendant in the main action, on the findings made, it, likewise, would have been held to that amount. But to treat the judgment against the Candy Company as damage resulting from fault under article 1053 of the Motor Company is, I think, to confuse the liability of the Candy Company to the principal plaintiff with its consequences.\nFor instance, the driver is bound for the total damage because he participated in causing it; it is his act and that alone that has given rise to the judgment against him as well as to the civil responsibility of his employer for the total amount. The ultimate responsibility of the Motor Company has nothing whatever to do with creating either liability.\nThe distribution, not of liability, but of the ultimate loss as between the culpable joint actors themselves, is a different legal function and is effected by exacting from each according to the degree of participation in causing the damage. If the driver had been sued alone, any action thereafter brought by him against the Motor Company would be by way of enforcing that contribution and not the prosecution of a delict against himself within article 1053. If the Motor Company were brought into the principal action as a co-defendant, the judgment in solidarity would preclude any question of the right to contribution. But there are conditions to the pursuit of that relief, one of which is that the party claiming has in fact paid another's share of the joint judgment or liability; and it would seem undoubted that where there is no judgment in solidarity, all defences available in the original action would be open to the defendant in the subsequent action.\nThe proceeding in warranty here by the Candy Company is in reality of that nature, the assertion of a claim to contribution, and the question is whether it is properly brought in warranty. As the decisions cited show, there are different categories of contractual and delictual responsibility which can be enforced in that procedure, but they all partake in some degree of a quality which constitutes the essence of the obligation of guaranty: a duty to defend\n[page 160]\nanother in respect of a certain act, or as the English law states one mode of it, \"to save harmless'' from certain consequences. Indemnity does not go quite so far, but its effects are in large measure the same; and I should say that indemnity or such an equivalent is a minimal prerequisite to receivability in warranty. If I interpreted the judgment below to mean, as I do not, that the appeal Court intended to add a new class of claim to those determinable under warranty, I should be obliged to take other considerations into account. On the other hand, and with the greatest respect for that Court, I cannot find in the reasons an appreciation of the distinction between guaranty or indemnity and contribution, including the conditions of the prosecution of each.\nThe respondents in the appeal, sensing the difficulty presented by these circumstances, have made a partial desistement of 10% of the judgment which is intended to represent the degree of responsibility of the driver and the Candy Company, and the question is whether that can affect the result at which I have otherwise arrived. I do not think so. That act impliedly admits, in fact, the view expressed, that the claim is one for contribution.\nThe law of France on this matter is laid down in Pandectes Fran\u00e7aises, Nouveau R\u00e9pertoire, T. 34, p. 36 et seq.:\n49. C'est, toutefois, \u00e0 la condition que le fait qui sert de base \u00e0 la demande en garantie ou en responsabilit\u00e9, soit le m\u00eame que celui sur lequel est fond\u00e9e la demande principale. Un des motifs qui ont pouss\u00e9 le l\u00e9gislateur \u00e0 \u00e9dicter les dispositions dont s'agit, a \u00e9t\u00e9, en effet, ainsi qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit supra, n. 44, d'\u00e9viter la contrari\u00e9t\u00e9 de jugements susceptibles de se produire devant des tribunaux successivement saisis. Cette consid\u00e9ration indique que, pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de ces dispositions de faveur, la demande en garantie ne doit pas \u00eatre une simple action r\u00e9cursoire, tendant de la part de celui qui la forme, \u00e0 \u00eatre rendu indemne, par un tiers, des condamnations dont, finalement, les cons\u00e9quences doivent lui incomber. Elle doit \u00eatre connexe \u00e0 la demande principale, s'y rattacher par un lien de d\u00e9pendance intime et n\u00e9cessaire, en \u00eatre l'accessoire.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . .\n54. \u2026Que, si toute action en garantie peut, pour \u00eatre recevable, prendre sa source dans un fait quelconque, ou dans une faute commise par celui qui est appel\u00e9 en garantie, c'est \u00e0 la condition que ce fait ou cette faute ait \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause de l'action principale.\n[page 161]\nThe judgment of the Court of Revision in Th\u00e9rien v. City of Montreal and Montreal Street Railway Company 15 is a special application of the rule. There the plaintiff was injured through the dangerous condition of a street brought about by the joint negligence of the City and the Company but the City was liable in two aspects: one for its personal fault in allowing the steep side slope of the street to exist, and the other proceeding from the delict of the Company in maintaining its pole in a dangerous position. The City was sued alone and in warranty claimed indemnity against the Company. By the judgment the latter was condemned to \"pay and reimburse\" the City for one-half of the damages recovered. The damages were divided according to the independent responsibility of each as between themselves; but the claim in warranty was in fact for quasi-indemnity in relation to the second basis of liability.\nIf distribution of the loss could be effected in warranty, since one of two defendants jointly liable can implead the other in that proceeding, O'Connor v. Flynn 16, it would mean that that step could become the accompaniment of every action involving a joint delict. That result might be not only unobjectionable but highly convenient as a means of determining the whole controversy; and no one would willingly add another item to the intricacies of Quebec procedure; but that it would be a departure from the civil law as enunciated by the commentators and the decisions seems to me to be unquestionable, and procedural confusion can easily involve substantive matters such as the nature of the judgment here. In English common law jurisdictions under modern legislation governing negligence, such a division is made as part of the adjudication of the action; but the law of Quebec does not authorize it. In Cormier v. Delisle 17, in which Duranleau J. has clearly indicated the distinction made here between guaranty and contribution, he speaks, at p. 482, of \"sa part contributive\", and of its determination \"soit par une action en garantie dans l'action principale soit par une action principale\". The reference to the action in guaranty is, of course, a dictum, but it points the consequences of confirming the judgment in this case.\n[page 162]\nA further consideration remains. Mr. Laurendeau argues that the claim of Masoud, likewise, is struck with a fatal flaw. It is, he says, an action r\u00e9cursoire in responsibility, and being so, he is entitled to challenge not only his liability in warranty but also the liability of Masoud in the main action; from the judgment in the. latter there was no appeal, but because the claim in the accessory proceeding is not true guaranty, it is the same as an independent action in which all defences would be open.\nQuasi-indemnity arising in law from a delictual act for which another incurs civil responsibility is distinguishable in character from a contract to guarantee or defend agaisnt a certain act or obligation. The obliger in the latter is directly interested, through the implications of the contract, in the determination of the original issue. He becomes the obligee's defender and the Code contemplates not only his participation in the defence but in formal guaranty, that he make the defence his own.\nIn the present case there is no such implication from either the implied warranty of fitness or the fault in setting a dangerous agency in action. The breach of warranty in reality sounds in damages. In such a case, however, the law either implies a quasi-indemnity or assimilates the delictual liability to that of contractual indemnity so far, at least, as to permit a claim in r\u00e9cursoire under warranty procedure.\nBut it is unnecessary to pursue the examination of this feature further: I will assume in Mr. Laurendeau's favour that he is entitled to challenge the judgment against Masoud, but that does not, in my opinion, serve him to any purpose.\nThe courts below have concurred in holding that the defect of the machine was a participating cause of the damages and either Masoud or the Candy Company was chargeable with the legal care of the truck. In either case there would be a resulting liability under article 1054, against which neither could successfully invoke the exculpatory provision of that article. The person charged with the care of a thing cannot avail himself of that provision if the vice has arisen from the fault or negligence of the manufacturer or repairer with whom he deals. Here the defect was patent to professional skill, and the owner was\n[page 163]\nentitled, at the time of the accident, in respect of personal care, to rely upon the exercise of that skill by the Motor Company: but for the purposes of the exculpation, it is the same as if the Motor Company had been his agent in making the inspection or reconditioning: Juris-Classeur Civil, Art. 1382-83 fin. 1384, Responsabilit\u00e9 du Fait des Choses, paragraphe N\u00ba 450. From this it follows that the Motor Company would be liable either through Masoud or the Candy Company, and I see no reason, on the evidence, to place it on the Company rather than the owner.\nI would therefore allow the appeal against the judgment in favour of the Candy Company, but dismiss it with costs in respect of Masoud. The appellant will be entitled to recover one-third of its costs in this Court against the Candy Company. There will be no costs as between the Candy Company and the Motor Company in the Appeal Court.\nCartwright J. : The facts of this case are set out in the reasons for judgment of other members of the Court. The learned trial judge has found that the injuries suffered by the plaintiff were due \"mainly if not exclusively\" to the defective condition of the brakes of the automobile of the appellant Masoud. In the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) 18 the majority were of the opinion, with which I respectfully agree, that such defective condition of the brakes was the sole cause of the accident. Pratte J., with whom Gagn\u00e9 J., agrees, says:\nA ce sujet, il faut dire d'abord que, d'apr\u00e8s la preuve, c'est la d\u00e9faillance du frein qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 la seule cause g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice de l'accident.\nHyde J., with whom McDougall J. agrees, says:\nI am of the opinion that the accident and the resulting damages were exclusively due to the defective hydraulic braking system on the truck.\nAll of these learned judges and, as I understand, all of the members of this Court are of opinion that it was rightly held that the existence of this defective condition was due to the fault of the appellant. Under these circumstances it is apparent that the effect of the judgment of the Court of King's Bench is to require that the damages suffered by the plaintiff be paid by the party by whose fault they were caused. Prima facie this result would\n[page 164]\nappear to be in accordance with the law. The able argument of counsel for the appellant has raised doubts in my mind as to whether there are not difficulties, of, as I respectfully think, a technical and procedural nature, in the way of affirming the judgment of the Court of King's Bench but before we interfere with that judgment it is necessary that we should be satisfied that it is in error and I am not satisfied of this. To doubt is to affirm.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Taschereau.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Beauregard, Bock, Beauregard & Taschereau.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Brais, Campbell & Mercier.\n1 Q.R.

Nadeau, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 164\nDate: 1953-02-02\nEmmanuel Dulac (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nOdilon Nadeau (Defendant) Respondent.\n1952: March 26; 1953: February 2.\nPresent : Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau, Rand, Estey and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nImmovable\u2014Removal of building and incorporation with another\u2014Notice of ownership\u2014Promise of sale\u2014Conditional\u2014Tradition and actual possession\u2014Payment of purchase price\u2014Whether Art. 416 C.C. applies\u2014Meaning and scope of word \u201cmaterials\u201d in Art. 416 C.C.\u2014 Arts. 876, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 1478, 1487 C.C.\nThe respondent agreed to sell to R under a promise of sale, accompanied by tradition and actual possession, a certain lot with the buildings thereon. The purchase price was to be paid in two instalments. There was an absolute prohibition to register the promise, and it was further stipulated that the deed of sale would not be signed until payment of the whole purchase price and that the respondent would not be obliged to avail himself of the clause which provided for the nullity of the promise for non-compliance of all the conditions thereof.\nBefore the first instalment on the purchase price had become due, R sold a house and shed of the buildings thereon to the appellant who, as stipulated between the latter and R, removed them to his own land where he united the house with a second building which he had purchased, and after alterations and improvements of the whole made his residence. The respondent registered a notice of ownership of the building against the appellant's land. The latter took action to have the notice radiated. The trial judge maintained the action on the ground that, by virtue of Art. 1478 C.C., R had become the owner of the building and could, therefore, give title to the Appellant. The Court of Appeal for Quebec reversed that judgment.\nHeld (Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. dissenting), that the appeal should be allowed.\nHeld: The promise of sale given by the respondent, although accompanied \u25a0by tradition and actual possession, was not in this case equivalent to a sale '(Rinfret C.J. contra and Rand J. expressing no opinion).\nPer Rinfret C.J.: The promise of sale was not dependent on any conditions which prevented the application of Art. 1478 C.C. The respondent was not any more the owner at the time of the sale to the appellant. Besides the fact that the respondent was not obliged to avail himself of the clause providing for the nullity of the promise, the sale of the appellant was made before any payment had become due to the respondent. There existed, therefore, at that time no condition to be discharged and the nullity clause could not operate. There was no suspensive condition attached to the promise. What was suspended until the last payment was not the transfer of property but the signing of the deed.\nA finding of good faith is a question of fact and, in view of the trial judge's finding that the appellant was in good faith when he purchased from R there was no justification here to set aside such finding.\nIn this case, the improvements made by the appellant were so extensive that they greatly exceeded the value of the building purchased from R and the respondent could not pretend that he was still the owner by application of Arts. 418 and 419 C.C.\nPer Rand J.: Assuming that ownership did not pass to the purchaser from the respondent, the inseverable incorporation of the structure in his house and land gave the appellant, by virtue of Art. 416 C.C, which embodies the general rule of accession, title thereto: the respondent has, therefore, no interest in the appellant's land which could be protected by registration.\nPer Estey J.: The terms contained in the promise of sale do not permit of its being classified as a sale within the meaning of Art. 1478 C.C. But by virtue of the law of accession, the appellant became the owner of the house and shed. The act of accession determines the question of ownership and if that act comes, as it did here, within the terms of Art. 416 C.C, the owner of the materials can only recover their value or damages. The construction of the word \"materials\" in Art. 416 C.C. should not be restricted to the word \"movables\". As ordinarily used and understood in such a context, the word includes everything movable or immovable, necessary or incidental to the completion of the buildings or works. The word is used here in a broad and comprehensive sense which would include the attachment or incorporation of a small building with a larger one, when the latter is attached to the land. The question of good or bad faith does not affect the appellant's title but may be important in fixing compensation. Per Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. (dissenting) : By the terms of the promise of sale, the transfer of property was suspended until all the payments on the purchase price had been made. The seller to the appellant did not have the ownership and that sale, therefore, was null as being the sale of a thing which did not belong to the seller (Art. 1487 CO.\nThere is a presumption juris et de jure that the appellant was not in good faith, and even if it could be said that he was, his good faith could not validate his purchase as against the respondent.\nThe appellant cannot invoke the provisions of Art. 416 C.C. The word \"materials\" in that article must be taken in its usual sense; it does not include immovables but only those movables which can be classified as materials. It is only by the incorporation to an immovable that the materials lose their nature of movable to acquire that of the immovable. The respondent's house, after its removal to the appellant's land, did not constitute \"materials\". Moreover, that building was clearly an immovable by nature before it was moved (Art. 376 C.C.) and its severance and re-attachment to the soil of the appellant did not affect or change its immovable character.\nAs a privilege or hypothec can be registered against a building without affecting the land, the respondent could, as he did, validly protect his ownership by registration.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court in an action for radiation of a notice of ownership.\nRosaire Beaudoin, Q.C., for the appellant.\nGuy Hudon, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice: En cette cause il y a conflit entre le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et la Cour du Banc du Roi, si\u00e9geant en appel 2, sur un point qui me para\u00eet essentiel.\nL'intim\u00e9 a fait enregistrer sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui, au bureau d'enregistrement, appara\u00eet au nom de l'appelant, un avis \u00e0 l'effet qu'une maison d'habitation qui se trouve sur cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lui appartenait (\u00e0 l'intim\u00e9).\nL'appelant, par son action, a demand\u00e9 que cette maison d'habitation soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e lui appartenir et que l'intim\u00e9 soit tenu de radier l'avis qu'il avait ainsi fait enregistrer.\nIl y avait une autre conclusion alternative \u00e0 l'effet que, si cet avis ne pouvait \u00eatre radi\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9 soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l'appelant la somme de $3,500 pour les am\u00e9liorations qu'il avait faites \u00e0 la maison; et, sur paiement de cette somme, que l'intim\u00e9 soit tenu d'enlever la b\u00e2tisse du terrain de l'appelant. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a jug\u00e9 que l'appelant avait acquis la maison de bonne foi d'un nomm\u00e9 Pierre Rodrigue qui, d'apr\u00e8s lui, en \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire au moment de la vente et qu'il avait pay\u00e9 le prix d'achat; apr\u00e8s quoi, qu'il l'avait transport\u00e9e sur son terrain et qu'il l'avait r\u00e9par\u00e9e et incorpor\u00e9e \u00e0 une autre b\u00e2tisse. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il serait impossible, \u00e0 l'heure actuelle, de diviser les b\u00e2tisses et de donner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 la partie que ce dernier pr\u00e9tend lui appartenir.\nPour arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, il fait remarquer qu'en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant au titre de Rodrigue, ce dernier avait une promesse de vente de l'intim\u00e9 accompagn\u00e9e de possession actuelle, ce qui, en vertu de l'article 1478 C.C., \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 vente.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi, au contraire, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis que l'appelant n'avait pas \u00e9tabli qu'il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de la maison d'habitation, parce que son vendeur, Rodrigue, n'y avait lui-m\u00eame aucun droit \"sauf une promesse de vente accord\u00e9e \u00e0 certaines conditions qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies\". Elle en a conclu que l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire de la maison d'habitation et qu'il avait donc le droit de faire enregistrer sur l'emplacement o\u00f9 la maison avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9e \"un avis d\u00e9non\u00e7ant au registrateur et aux tiers son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur cette maison\". Elle a donc infirm\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et a rejet\u00e9 l'action de l'appelant avec d\u00e9pens.\nJe ne puis en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que la promesse de vente consentie par l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 Rodrigue \u00e9tait subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 des conditions qui emp\u00eachent l'article 1478 C.C. d'avoir son plein effet. Ce qui revient \u00e0 dire qu'apr\u00e8s avoir consenti la promesse de vente l'intim\u00e9, au moment o\u00f9 Rodrigue a vendu \u00e0 l'appelant, n'\u00e9tait plus le propri\u00e9taire.\nPersonne ne conteste que Rodrigue a vendu \u00e0 l'appelant; et l'intim\u00e9 ne peut r\u00e9ussir que s'il \u00e9tablit qu'\u00e0 ce momentl\u00e0 Rodrigue n'avait pas encore acquis la maison d'habitation dont il s'agit.\nSi nous r\u00e9f\u00e9rons \u00e0 la promesse de vente de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 Rodrigue, en date du 24 juillet 1947, on y constate que l'intim\u00e9 a promis de vendre \u00e0 Rodrigue, qui s'est oblig\u00e9 d'acheter, la terre qu'il avait acquise le jour m\u00eame d'un M. Lucien Desrochers avec les b\u00e2tisses y construites. Le prix de vente y \u00e9tait stipul\u00e9 \u00e0 $1,095 que Rodrigue s'est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 payer en deux versements : $150 le 24 juillet 1948 et $945 le 24 juillet 1949, le tout sans int\u00e9r\u00eat. La vente par Rodrigue \u00e0 l'appelant est ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 Rodrigue devait faire \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 le premier versement sur le prix de vente. Elle est du 24 mai 1948.\nIl est bien dit dans le contrat qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut par Rodrigue d'acquitter les versements \u00e0 l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance et de se conformer \u00e0 toutes les conditions stipul\u00e9es \u00e0 l'acte, la promesse de vente deviendrait nulle et l'intim\u00e9 pourrait disposer de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 comme il l'entendait, sans indemnit\u00e9 pour les am\u00e9liorations qui auraient pu avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faites sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, etc.\nMais, en outre qu'il fut express\u00e9ment convenu que l'intim\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9valoir de la clause de nullit\u00e9 que je viens de r\u00e9sumer, il faut n\u00e9cessairement remarquer que la vente par Rodrigue \u00e0 l'appelant a eu lieu avant que le versement de $150 devienne d\u00fb, soit le 24 juillet 1948. L'intim\u00e9 a bien d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage, que Rodrigue n'avait rempli aucune des conditions de la vente et entre autres n'avait donn\u00e9 aucun acompte sur le prix d'achat. Mais, la r\u00e9ponse toute naturelle, c'est que, lorsque Rodrigue a vendu \u00e0 rappelant, il n'y en avait pas de d\u00fb. Il peut \u00eatre vrai que plus tard Rodrigue n'a pas rempli les conditions, mais ce qui est important c'est de savoir si, au moment de sa vente \u00e0 l'appelant, il existait des conditions qu'il \u00e9tait appel\u00e9 \u00e0 remplir. S'il n'en existait pas, la clause de nullit\u00e9 ne pouvait s'op\u00e9rer. En plus, comme l'intim\u00e9 pouvait ne pas s'en pr\u00e9valoir, au cas m\u00eame o\u00f9 elle aurait pu op\u00e9rer, il fallait n\u00e9cessairement que l'intim\u00e9 manifest\u00e2t son intention d'une fa\u00e7on quelconque\u2014ce qu'il n'a pas fait\u2014sans quoi la promesse de vente restait en vigueur et l'intim\u00e9 avait parfaitement le droit d'en exiger l'ex\u00e9cution par Rodrigue. (Voir Gagnon v. Lemay 3, et les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents y cit\u00e9s.)\nDans cette cause de Gagnon v. Lemay la Gour Supr\u00eame a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 unanimement:\nWhere in a deed of sale or promise of sale, it is stated that such deed would become null and void ipso facto without mise en demeure if the buyer failed to make any payment in capital or interest at the specified dates, such stipulation is exclusively in the interest of the seller, who has the right to choose between the rescission of the contract or its execution, the obligation of the buyer remaining absolute and without alternative. La promesse de vente elle-m\u00eame suppose que l'intim\u00e9, au lieu de la traiter comme devenant nulle ipso facto \u00e0 raison du d\u00e9faut par Rodrigue de se conformer aux conditions qui y sont stipul\u00e9es, Nadeau aurait le droit de la traiter, au contraire, comme conservant son plein effet, ainsi que le d\u00e9montre le paragraphe de cette promesse qui est intitul\u00e9: \"Recours\":\nIl est express\u00e9ment convenu que si M. Nadeau se pr\u00e9vaut de la clause de nullit\u00e9 ci-dessus \u2026 etc.\nOn voit donc qu'ind\u00e9pendamment de la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans Gagnon v. Lemay les parties elles-m\u00eames, dans la promesse de vente, ont pr\u00e9vu le cas o\u00f9 M. Nadeau ne se pr\u00e9vaudrait pas de la clause de nullit\u00e9 et alors il se conserve le droit d'exiger que M. Rodrigue se conforme aux obligations qu'il avait assum\u00e9es dans la promesse de vente.\nIl est donc inexact de dire qu'au moment o\u00f9 Rodrigue a vendu \u00e0 l'appelant la promesse de vente \u00e9tait devenue nulle. Elle \u00e9tait, au contraire, en pleine existence et conservait toute sa vigueur.\nL'intim\u00e9 Nadeau et Rodrigue avaient stipul\u00e9 que la promesse de vente ne devait pas \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9 est donc mal venu \u00e0 soulever le point que l'appelant n'est pas all\u00e9 s'informer au bureau d'enregistrement.\nEn plus, on a voulu voir dans cette promesse de vente une condition suspensive du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sous pr\u00e9texte qu'elle ne prendrait effet que \"sur paiement du dernier versement\". Mais ce n'est pas la promesse de vente ou la convention entre l'intim\u00e9 Nadeau et Rodrigue (le 24 juillet 1947) qui \u00e9tait suspendue jusqu'au paiement du dernier versement. La convention elle-m\u00eame ne dit nullement que Rodrigue ne deviendra propri\u00e9taire que lors du paiement du dernier versement. Cette condition se lit: \"L'acte de vente se fera sur paiement du dernier versement\". Par cons\u00e9quent, ce n'est pas le lien contractuel qui est suspendu jusqu'au paiement de ce versement, c'est simplement l'acte de vente ou le contrat lui-m\u00eame.\nJe ne saurais interpr\u00e9ter la promesse de vente entre Nadeau et Rodrigue comme contenant une condition suspensive. Le fait m\u00eame que je viens de faire remarquer, \u00e0 savoir, que M. Nadeau est parfaitement libre de maintenir cette promesse de vente en vigueur nonobstant que M. Rodrigue n'accomplisse pas les conditions qui y sont stipul\u00e9es, prouve qu'il ne s'agit pas d'une nullit\u00e9 ipso facto. En effet, si M. Nadeau, malgr\u00e9 l'inaccomplissement des conditions par Rodrigue, a la facult\u00e9 de tenir la promesse de vente comme continuant d'exister et, d\u00e8s lors, de contraindre Rodrigue \u00e0 en remplir les obligations, il suit n\u00e9cessairement que, dans ce cas, Nadeau reste vis-\u00e0-vis de Rodrigue tenu de lui consentir l'acte de vente d\u00e9finitif lorsque les conditions en question auront \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies par Rodrigue.\nDans cette situation, je ne trouve rien au dossier pour emp\u00eacher l'article 1478 C.C. de prendre tout son effet. Il y a eu, le 24 juillet 1947, entre l'intim\u00e9 et Rodrigue une promesse de vente avec tradition et possession actuelle. En effet, Rodrigue en a tellement pris possession qu'il a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 couper sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 tous les arbres qui s'y trouvaient; et l'article 1478 C.C. \u00e9dicte, qu'en pareil cas, la promesse de vente \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 vente. C'\u00e9tait l\u00e0 la situation lorsque Rodrigue a vendu \u00e0 l'appelant et, \u00e0 mon humble avis, l'intim\u00e9 a compl\u00e8tement failli de d\u00e9montrer que. l'appelant n'\u00e9tait pas valablement devenu le propri\u00e9taire de la maison d'habitation.\nIl en r\u00e9sulte que c'est \u00e0 tort qu'il a pr\u00e9tendu en \u00eatre rest\u00e9 le propri\u00e9taire et qu'il a fait enregistrer son avis \u00e0 cet effet. L'action de l'appelant \u00e9tait donc bien fond\u00e9e et le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9.\nQu'ult\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la vente de Rodrigue \u00e0 l'appelant, Rodrigue ait failli de remplir les obligations qu'il avait assum\u00e9es dans son contrat avec l'intim\u00e9, cela ne saurait donner des droits \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 contre l'appelant qui a acquis la maison d'habitation alors que Rodrigue avait parfaitement le droit d'en disposer. La situation est seulement que, si l'intim\u00e9 veut maintenant proc\u00e9der contre Rodrigue, il est libre de le faire, soit en r\u00e9clamant les paiements pr\u00e9vus dans la promesse de vente, soit en dommages, mais cela ne peut affecter le titre de l'appelant.\nJe ne saurais me rendre \u00e0 l'avis que l'appelant n'\u00e9tait pas de bonne foi lorsqu'il a acquis de Rodrigue la maison en litige.\nCette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9e en particulier dans un jugement fortement raisonn\u00e9 de l'honorable Juge Carroll, alors qu'il faisait partie de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, dans la cause de \u201cThe St-Lawrence Terminal Company\u201d v. Hall\u00e9 4. Ce jugement est rapport\u00e9 au long en m\u00eame temps que celui de la Cour du Banc du Roi, qui l'a confirm\u00e9. Il suffit d'en reproduire le jug\u00e9 qui est un bon r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision rendue par cet honorable juge:\nLa vente d'un immeuble consentie par celui qui l'occupe sans en \u00eatre le propri\u00e9taire l\u00e9gal, est, pour l'acheteur, un titre au sens de l'art. 412 C.C. Par suite, sa possession en vertu de ce titre peut \u00eatre de bonne foi, lui assurer, quant \u00e0 ses am\u00e9liorations, les droits pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'article 417 C.C. et rendre siens les fruits qu'il per\u00e7oit, sans compensation avec remboursement des am\u00e9liorations, art. 411 C.C.\nL'on trouve \u00e9galement sur cette m\u00eame question un jugement de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par l'honorable Juge Mignault, parlant au nom de la Cour, qui \u00e9tait unanime 5. Le jug\u00e9 se lit comme suit:\nThe purchaser of a thing lost or stolen is in \"good faith\" within the meaning of art. 1489 C.C, if he honestly believes that the vendor is the owner of the thing lost or stolen. It is not necessary that his good faith be \"une bonne foi \u00e9clatante\", or that his error be an invincible one.\nAu cours des raisons du jugement, l'on trouve le paragraphe suivant:\nWith great respect, I cannot help thinking that the learned trial judge placed the duty of a purchaser of a second hand car on much too high a plane. Good faith does not need to be \"une bonne foi \u00e9clatante\", it suffices that it be an honest belief that the vendor is the owner of the thing sold. Nor if there be an error on the part of the purchaser is it necessary that the error be an invincible one. I do not think the authorities cited by the learned judge should be given that effect, for it would not be justified by the language of the code.\nL'article 412 C.C. \u00e9dicte:\nLe possesseur est de bonne foi lorsqu'il poss\u00e8de en vertu d'un titre dont il ignore les vices, ou l'av\u00e8nement de la cause r\u00e9solutoire qui y met fin. Cette bonne foi ne cesse n\u00e9anmoins que du moment o\u00f9 ces vices ou cette cause lui sont d\u00e9nonc\u00e9s par interpellation judiciaire.\nEt la doctrine est \u00e0 l'effet que la mauvaise foi ne se pr\u00e9sume pas; elle doit \u00eatre prouv\u00e9e contre celui dont la possession est \u00e9tablie. La pr\u00e9somption de bonne foi cesse apr\u00e8s la demande en revendication. (2 Baudry-Lacantine-rie et Chauveau, n, 311; 9 Demolombe, n. 615, 630; 2 Aubry et Rau, 273, paragraphe 206.)\nPeu importe que le titre translatif soit nul en la forme ou nul quant au fond m\u00eame du droit qu'il conf\u00e8re. Ce principe s'entend d'une nullit\u00e9 de droit comme d'une nullit\u00e9 relative par suite de laquelle l'acte serait seulement annulable ou rescindable. (Voir 9 Demolombe, n. 609 et s.; 3 Aubry et Rau, 271, paragraphe 206; 6 Laurent, 218 et s.). Celui qui poss\u00e8de en vertu d'un titre translatif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, dont il ignore les vices, fait les fruits siens, et ce, sans qu'il y ait \u00e0 distinguer si sa bonne foi provient d'une erreur de droit, ou d'une erreur de fait. L'erreur de droit peut, aussi bien que l'erreur de fait, n'\u00eatre pas exclusive de la bonne foi. (Baudry-Lacantinerie et Chauveau, n. 310; 4 Huc, n. 120; Demolombe, loc. cit.; Aubry et Rau, loc. cit.).\nEt la question de savoir si une personne est de bonne foi est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement parlant une question de fait. Or, ici, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ce fait en faveur de l'appelant. Il dit dans son jugement:\nLe demandeur \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment de bonne foi. Rodrigue \u00e9tait en possession de la terre o\u00f9 il coupait du bois et le demandeur n'eut aucun doute que Rodrigue \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire.\nD'ailleurs si on r\u00e9f\u00e8re au titre il avait une promesse de vente et possession actuelle, ce qui \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 vente.\nSi Rodrigue \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire, le demandeur ayant achet\u00e9 de bonne foi et ayant pay\u00e9 est devenu propri\u00e9taire de la b\u00e2tisse.\nOn remarque que, d'apr\u00e8s l'article 412 C.C., sa bonne foi ne pouvait dispara\u00eetre \"que du moment o\u00f9 ces vices (i.e. les vices de son titre) lui sont d\u00e9nonc\u00e9s par interpellation judiciaire.\"\nL'intim\u00e9 a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 faire \u00e9tat du fait qu'il serait all\u00e9 voir l'appelant au cours des travaux que ce dernier faisait sur la maison apr\u00e8s qu'il l'e\u00fbt transport\u00e9e chez lui. Mais, tout d'abord, la preuve \u00e9tablit que, lors de cette visite, l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas vu l'appelant; il n'a parl\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 une petite fille qui se trouvait \u00e0 la maison. Plus tard, l'appelant lui-m\u00eame s'est rendu chez l'intim\u00e9 pour le rencontrer et de nouveau ils ne se sont pas vus. L'intim\u00e9 a fait envoyer \u00e0 l'appelant une lettre ou deux.\nL'on peut voir par l'article 412 C.C. que ces d\u00e9marches ou lettres ne pouvaient avoir pour effet de faire cesser la bonne foi de l'appelant puisque, \u00e0 cette fin, il ne fallait non moins qu'une d\u00e9nonciation par interpellation judiciaire.\nCette interpellation judiciaire de la part de l'intim\u00e9 n'a jamais eu lieu. Il s'est content\u00e9 de faire enregistrer un avis dans lequel il pr\u00e9tendait informer que la maison lui appartenait. Cet enregistrement \u00e9tait manifestement inefficace \u00e0 raison de l'article 412 C.C. De toute fa\u00e7on, je suis d'avis que l'intim\u00e9, en droit, n'a aucun recours contre l'appelant. Son recours est contre Rodrigue qui continue de lui devoir les paiements stipul\u00e9s dans la promesse de vente qu'il a consentie \u00e0 Rodrigue, ou, peut-\u00eatre, une action en dommages contre Rodrigue. Mais l'appelant a justifi\u00e9 son droit d'\u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire, \u00e0 rencontre de Nadeau, de la maison que Rodrigue lui a vendue. Il en r\u00e9sulte qu'il avait parfaitement raison en concluant \u00e0 se faire confirmer ce titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et de demander que l'intim\u00e9 fut contraint de faire radier l'avis qu'il avait ill\u00e9galement fait enregistrer.\nCe sont l\u00e0 toutes les conclusions de l'action de l'appelant. Il n'est pas question de la part de l'intim\u00e9, pour le moment du moins, de revendiquer la maison en litige. Par les conclusions de sa d\u00e9fense \u00e9crite, il se contente de demander le rejet de l'action de l'appelant.\nMais, il ne saurait \u00eatre hors d'ordre de consid\u00e9rer quel rem\u00e8de l'intim\u00e9 pourrait avoir, s'il s'avisait de r\u00e9clamer la maison\u2014ce qu'il n'a pas fait jusqu'ici.\nLa preuve d\u00e9montre que la maison que l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend lui appartenir \u00e9tait \"compl\u00e8tement pourrie\". Apr\u00e8s l'avoir transport\u00e9e sur son terrain, l'appelant a remplac\u00e9 les fondations et le ch\u00e2ssis; il a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 d'\u00f4ter une grosse moiti\u00e9 des montants; de r\u00e9parer la couverture compl\u00e8tement \u00e0 nouveau, c'est-\u00e0-dire, d'enlever celle qu'il y avait et d'en mettre une nouvelle; de changer les fen\u00eatres qui ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9es.\nSuivant la d\u00e9cision du juge de premi\u00e8re instance, apr\u00e8s avoir transport\u00e9 cette maison et l'avoir r\u00e9par\u00e9e, il l'avait \"incorpor\u00e9e \u00e0 une autre\". Et le juge ajoute: \"Il serait impossible \u00e0 l'heure actuelle de diviser les b\u00e2tisses et de donner au d\u00e9fendeur la partie qui lui appartient d'apr\u00e8s lui\". Cette d\u00e9cision de fait est parfaitement justifi\u00e9e par la preuve fournie absolument sans contradiction.\nCette preuve \u00e9tablit que les deux maisons, au moment de l'action, \u00e9taient \"coll\u00e9es ensemble\" et que les deux n'en faisaient plus qu'une seule.\nCette maison en litige, au moment de l'achat par l'appelant, \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e inhabit\u00e9e depuis au moins un an. Elle avait m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 endommag\u00e9e par le feu et tout l'arri\u00e8re de la couverture avait \u00e9t\u00e9 br\u00fbl\u00e9. Les ouvriers qui ont travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9fection de la maison sont venus rendre des t\u00e9moignages qui confirment les faits ci-dessus. Ils jurent qu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de tout remplacer pour la rendre habitable. Ils ajoutent qu'\u00e0 la suite des travaux qu'ils y ont faits, elle est devenue une seule maison, un seul tout, et \u2022c'est ce qui fait dire au juge de premi\u00e8re instance, dans son jugement, qu'il \"serait impossible \u00e0 l'heure actuelle de diviser les b\u00e2tisses et de donner au d\u00e9fendeur la partie qui lui appartient d'apr\u00e8s lui\".\nCette situation fait penser \u00e0 la livre de chair du \"Marchand de Venise\", de Shakespeare, et m\u00eame au jugement de Salomon dans l'affaire o\u00f9 deux femmes r\u00e9clamaient le m\u00eame enfant.\nOn est donc en droit de se demander, pour le cas o\u00f9 l'intim\u00e9 voudrait se faire remettre sa maison, de quelle fa\u00e7on il pourrait obtenir, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, un jugement ex\u00e9cutoire. Pour commencer, il lui serait impossible, \u00e0 l'heure qu'il est, de reprendre possession de la maison dans l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait sur sa terre. Il ne pourrait pas retrouver la maison pourrie qu'il avait promis de vendre \u00e0 Rodrigue. Cette maison n'existe plus. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement remplac\u00e9e par les travaux de l'appelant. En plus, elle est maintenant incorpor\u00e9e \u00e0 une autre maison dont l'appelant a fait un seul tout.\nIl y a donc lieu de se demander de quelle fa\u00e7on op\u00e9reraient les prescriptions des articles 413 et suivants du Code Civil.\nL'article 413 d\u00e9cr\u00e8te:\nTout ce qui s'unit et s'incorpore \u00e0 Ia chose appartient au propri\u00e9taire \u2026\nL'article 414:\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du sol emporte la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du dessus et du dessous.\nL'article 416:\nLe propri\u00e9taire du sol qui a fait des constructions et ouvrages avec des mat\u00e9riaux qui ne lui appartiennent pas, doit en payer la valeur; il peut aussi \u00eatre condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, s'il y a lieu; mais le propri\u00e9taire des mat\u00e9riaux n'a pas droit de les enlever.\nL'intim\u00e9 veut se soustraire \u00e0 l'effet de l'article qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de en disant qu'il ne s'agit pas de mat\u00e9riaux, mais d'une maison qui est un immeuble par nature. Il serait int\u00e9ressant de se demander jusqu'\u00e0 quel point cette maison pourrie et qui ne tenait plus debout ne pourrait pas \u00eatre assimil\u00e9e \u00e0 une maison qu'on a d\u00e9molie; car il est indiscutable qu'une maison d\u00e9molie cesse d'\u00eatre immeuble et que les parties en sont devenues meubles.\nMais poursuivons: Si l'on applique l'article 417 C.C., il est clair que les am\u00e9liorations sur la maison de l'intim\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par l'appelant avec ses mat\u00e9riaux et que le droit que peut pr\u00e9tendre l'intim\u00e9 d\u00e9pend de la nature de ces am\u00e9liorations ainsi que de la bonne ou mauvaise foi de celui qui les a faites.\nIci, nous avons la d\u00e9cision du juge de premi\u00e8re instance que l'appelant \u00e9tait de bonne foi. Nous avons la preuve que les am\u00e9liorations \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires. Donc, toujours d'apr\u00e8s l'article 417 C.C., l'intim\u00e9 ne peut les faire enlever; il doit dans tous les cas en payer le co\u00fbt, lors m\u00eame qu'elles n'existeraient plus et sans aucune compensation pour les fruits per\u00e7us, s'il y en a eus. Allons plus loin : Si l'appelant eut \u00e9t\u00e9 de mauvaise foi, tout ce que l'intim\u00e9 pouvait faire \u00e9tait, \u00e0 son choix, de retenir les am\u00e9liorations en payant ce ce qu'elles ont co\u00fbt\u00e9, ou leur valeur actuelle, ou permettre \u00e0 l'appelant de les enlever \u00e0 ses frais, si elles peuvent l'\u00eatre avec avantage sans d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer le reste de la maison.\nMais, l\u00e0 encore, l'article 418 C.C. entre en cause. La preuve d\u00e9montre clairement que les am\u00e9liorations faites par l'appelant furent tellement consid\u00e9rables et d\u00e9passaient \u00e0 tel point la valeur de la maison de l'intim\u00e9 (qui fut g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e9valu\u00e9e \u00e0 environ deux cents dollars), que l'appelant est parfaitement en droit d'exiger, avant de remettre la maison (si cela est possible), le paiement de la somme de $3,500 qu'il a d\u00e9pens\u00e9e pour la refaire.\nEnfin, dans cette derni\u00e8re alternative, en vertu de l'article 419 C.C., au cas o\u00f9 l'appelant serait tenu de restituer l'immeuble sur lequel il a fait les am\u00e9liorations, il aurait le droit de le retenir jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le remboursement lui en soit effectu\u00e9.\nDe toute fa\u00e7on, ce que revendiquerait l'intim\u00e9 ce n'est plus sa maison, mais un immeuble qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transform\u00e9, incorpor\u00e9 \u00e0 celui que l'appelant poss\u00e9dait et qui est devenu un autre immeuble compl\u00e8tement.\nOn voit donc que, si l'intim\u00e9 a fait enregistrer son avis dans le but de prot\u00e9ger son pr\u00e9tendu droit de reprendre possession de ce qui fut autrefois sa maison, cet avis est absolument inefficace et ill\u00e9gal. Il ne peut pr\u00e9tendre maintenir cet enregistrement. S'il a maintenant un recours, \u00e0 mon humble point de vue, ce n'est pas contre l'appelant, mais contre Rodrigue, soit, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, pour r\u00e9clamer de Rodrigue les versements du prix de vente que ce dernier s'\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 \u00e0 faire, ou en dommages contre Rodrigue pour avoir fait dispara\u00eetre de sur sa terre la maison sur laquelle Nadeau aurait pu pr\u00e9tendre poss\u00e9der une garantie pour son prix de vente. Sans compter que ce qui est disparu est seulement la maison elle-m\u00eame, mais que la terre, en autant que nous le sachions, est rest\u00e9e en la possession de Rodrigue. Je ne vois pas que Nadeau ait le moindre recours contre l'appelant, mais si, toutefois, ce recours existe, ce n'est certainement pas celui de revendiquer la maison, car ce recours est r\u00e9gi par les articles 413 et suivants du Code Civil qui sont analys\u00e9s plus haut.\nPour ma part, ce n'est pas sur l'application des articles 413, 414, 416 et 417 C.C. que je m'appuierais pour repousser la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9. Je veux bien envisager la maison de l'intim\u00e9 comme ayant conserv\u00e9 son caract\u00e8re d'immeuble par nature sans me croire oblig\u00e9 de discuter l'avis du juge de premi\u00e8re instance \"qu'il serait impossible, \u00e0 l'heure actuelle, de diviser les b\u00e2tisses et de donner au d\u00e9fendeur la partie qui lui appartient d'apr\u00e8s lui\" ; mais il m'est impossible de voir quelle r\u00e9ponse satisfaisante l'intim\u00e9 peut faire \u00e0 l'application des articles 418 et 419 C.C. Admettant sa pr\u00e9tention que, en d\u00e9pit de sa transformation, sa maison peut encore \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un immeuble par nature, ce qu'il ne peut \u00e9viter c'est que l'appelant a de toute \u00e9vidence fait sur cette maison des am\u00e9liorations dont la valeur s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 $3,500.\nD'apr\u00e8s l'article 418, m\u00eame si l'appelant, possesseur de la maison, \u00e9tait de mauvaise foi, il est prouv\u00e9 que \"les am\u00e9liorations qu'il a faites sur cette maison sont tellement consid\u00e9rables et dispendieuses\" qu'elles d\u00e9passent dans la proportion de dix-sept fois la valeur de la maison r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9, suivant l'estimation qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite sans contradiction au cours de l'enqu\u00eate. Dans ce cas, le tribunal pouvait forcer l'appelant (consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme tiers) de retenir l'immeuble auquel l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9met des pr\u00e9tentions en payant la valeur de cet immeuble \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9. Ici, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour le tribunal de forcer l'appelant \u00e0 retenir la maison puisque c'est lui-m\u00eame qui demande de la retenir. Enfin, par application de l'article 419, m\u00eame si l'appelant \u00e9tait tenu de restituer l'immeuble sur lequel il a fait ses am\u00e9liorations, dont il a droit \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement d'\u00eatre rembours\u00e9, il lui serait permis de retenir cet immeuble \"jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le remboursement soit effectu\u00e9\".\nJe r\u00e9p\u00e8te que, d'apr\u00e8s la fa\u00e7on dont le litige a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 la Cour, nous ne sommes pas appel\u00e9s \u00e0 nous prononcer l\u00e0-dessus, mais, d'autre part, comme il est bien dans l'ordre de chercher de quelle fa\u00e7on l'intim\u00e9 pourrait proc\u00e9der pour donner suite \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention qu'il est encore propri\u00e9taire de la maison, il me para\u00eet qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire de se demander quelles seraient les cons\u00e9quences d'un jugement qui le d\u00e9clarerait propri\u00e9taire.\nL'article 418 s'opposerait \u00e0 cette d\u00e9claration. En plus, en vertu de l'article 419, cette d\u00e9claration ne pourrait prendre un caract\u00e8re absolu, car, il faudrait bien y ins\u00e9rer que, dans l'\u00e9tat de la cause, l'intim\u00e9 ne pourrait reprendre possession de la maison qu'en payant la somme de $3,500 et que l'appelant aurait le droit de retenir la maison jusqu'\u00e0 ce que cette somme lui f\u00fbt pay\u00e9e.\nEn tenant compte de la situation et de la valeur de la maison au moment o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9e sur le terrain de l'appelant, en se rappelant que le prix stipul\u00e9 dans la promesse de vente par Nadeau \u00e0 Rodrigue pour tout le terrain, y compris la maison en litige, a \u00e9t\u00e9 de $1,095, il serait inconcevable que Nadeau se d\u00e9cid\u00e2t \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l'appelant la somme de $3,500. La cons\u00e9quence est que l'appelant garderait la maison m\u00eame si nous ne pouvions pas en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que la vente que lui en a consentie Rodrigue l'a v\u00e9ritablement constitu\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire.\nPassant \u00e0 un autre point de vue, je ne puis m'emp\u00eacher de formuler l'avis que cette sitpulation dans des contrats du genre de celui que Nadeau a consenti \u00e0 Rodrigue, \u00e0 l'effet que, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par Rodrigue de se conformer aux conditions de la promesse de vente, \"cette promesse deviendra nulle\u2026 sans aucun remboursement, sans proc\u00e9dures judiciaires, de plein droit\", est v\u00e9ritablement inexacte et contradictoire puisque le m\u00eame contrat comporte express\u00e9ment que Nadeau a l'option de se pr\u00e9valoir de la clause de nullit\u00e9 ou de ne pas s'en pr\u00e9valoir. Je sais bien que c'est une clause qu'on rencontre fr\u00e9quemment dans les contrats notari\u00e9s de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. A mon avis, elle constitue un contresens et c'est bien ce qui ressort du jugement de notre Cour dans la cause de Gagnon v. Lemay, \u00e0 laquelle je r\u00e9f\u00e8re au commencement de mes notes. En effet, il est inadmissible que la promesse de vente devienne nulle \"de plein droit\" si Nadeau, au contraire, conserve la facult\u00e9 de la tenir pour toujours en vigueur nonobstant que Rodrigue ait failli \"de se conformer \u00e0 toutes les conditions stipul\u00e9es aux pr\u00e9sentes\". On ne peut concevoir un contrat qui serait devenu nul et qui, n\u00e9anmoins, permettrait \u00e0 Nadeau de forcer Rodrigue \u00e0 en observer les conditions. Il s'ensuit que cette phrase: \"Cette promesse deviendra nulle\u2026 sans aucun remboursement, sans proc\u00e9dures judiciaires, de plein droit\" doit n\u00e9cessairement s'entendre (en vue du contexte du contrat) comme voulant dire que, \u00e0 son gr\u00e9, Nadeau ne sera pas tenu de l'observer pour l'avenir, si Rodrigue fait d\u00e9faut d'acquitter ses propres obligations; mais \u00e9vdemment, dans ce cas, l'on ne peut consid\u00e9rer la promesse comme \u00e9tant nulle, si Nadeau, comme il s'en est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit, fait option pour le maintien de cette promesse de vente.\nLa cons\u00e9quence de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de c'est que, d'apr\u00e8s le texte m\u00eame de la promesse de vente, elle ne devient pas nulle de plein droit et elle ne pourra \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme nulle que du moment que Nadeau aura manifest\u00e9, \u00e0 l'encontre de Rodrigue, sa d\u00e9cision de la tenir pour nulle \u00e0 l'avenir.\nNadeau ne pouvait donc, \u00e0 mon avis, et comme il a pr\u00e9tendu le faire en faisant enregistrer son avis sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Dulac, s'approprier le titre de propri\u00e9taire de la maison que Rodrigue a vendue \u00e0 Dulac Il lui incombait n\u00e9cessairement de commencer par faire \u00e9tablir son titre de propri\u00e9taire contradictoirement avec Rodrigue. Cette Cour n'a pas le droit de lui attribuer le titre de propri\u00e9taire qu'il invoque sans conna\u00eetre l'attitude de Rodrigue \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. En autant que le fait voir le dossier Rodrigue est bien loin d'admettre que Nadeau est redevenu propri\u00e9taire de la maison en litige puisque, dans une lettre qui est produite comme exhibit P-4, et qui porte la date du 24 ao\u00fbt 1949, il \u00e9met la pr\u00e9tention \"qu'il y a eu une \u2022 entente de prise entre M. Odilon Nadeau et Pierre Rodrigue en vertu de laquelle M. Odilon Nadeau aurait consenti \u00e0 laisser partir la maison \u00e0 la condition d'avoir d'autre garantie\". Cette lettre est adress\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelant par le notaire L.-P. Turgeon et elle ajoute: \"Ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait\", ou, en d'autres termes, que cette autre garantie a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e.\nMais je viens de faire remarquer que le litige qui nous est soumis ne concerne que la maison qui se trouvait sur la terre faisant l'objet du contrat entre Nadeau et Rodrigue. Le prix de vente par Nadeau \u00e0 Rodrigue a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 \u00e0 $1,095. Il s'ensuit que la maison ne repr\u00e9sente qu'une tr\u00e8s minime partie de l'objet de la vente.\nConform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la jurisprudence de cette Cour \u00e9tablie dans la cause de Gagnon v. Lemay (supra), et d'ailleurs, en vertu des termes m\u00eames du contrat entre Nadeau et Rodrigue (ainsi qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9 plus haut), le lien contractuel entre Nadeau et Rodrigue n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9teint automatiquement. Au contraire, Nadeau s'y r\u00e9servait le droit de ne pas se pr\u00e9valoir de la clause de nullit\u00e9 et, par cons\u00e9quent, de tenir Rodrigue aux obligations que le contrat comportait pour lui.\nCe contrat est donc toujours en vigueur et il n'appartenait pas \u00e0 Nadeau de se proclamer unilat\u00e9ralement propri\u00e9taire de la maison, comme il l'a fait dans l'avis qu'il a fait enregistrer et dont l'appelant demande la radiation.\nInd\u00e9pendamment des autres raisons qui militent contre le jugement dont est appel, il reste cet argument p\u00e9remptoire que les tribunaux ne peuvent pas tenir pour annul\u00e9: le contrat entre Nadeau et Rodrigue. S\u00fbrement ils ne peuvent le tenir comme annul\u00e9 seulement \u00e0 raison de la maison, dont l'appelant a pris possession, tout en laissant subsister le contrat quant \u00e0 la terre qui est d'embl\u00e9e la partie la plus importante de la transaction entre Nadeau et Rodrigue.\nNadeau ne peut demander de prendre pour acquis que la promesse de vente a cess\u00e9 d'exister \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la maison sans aucunement tenir compte des effets de cette promesse de vente relativement \u00e0 la terre.\nIl est vrai que, sur r\u00e9ception de la d\u00e9fense de l'intim\u00e9 Nadeau, Dulac a institu\u00e9 une action en garantie contre Rodrigue pour lui d\u00e9noncer cette d\u00e9fense et porter \u00e0 son attention que Nadeau pr\u00e9tendait \u00eatre propri\u00e9taire de la maison. Rodrigue n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'intervenir; il a fait d\u00e9faut sur cette action en garantie et il n'a pas contest\u00e9 la pr\u00e9tention de Nadeau sur ce point. Cette abstention de sa part peut parfaitement s'expliquer par le fait qu'il pouvait consid\u00e9rer la maison en litige comme \u00e9tant une partie insignifiante de l'objet de la promesse de vente entre Nadeau et lui. Toute la preuve d\u00e9montre que cette maison ne valait certainement pas la peine de s'engager dans le litige dispendieux qui est maintenant soumis \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada. A mon humble avis, il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 beaucoup plus simple pour Nadeau d'exiger de Rodrigue les paiements que comportait la promesse de vente que de faire enregistrer un avis pour affirmer son titre de propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 cette maison.\nMais, puisque litige il y a, il faut bien que cette Cour tranche la question, et, pour ma part, je me d\u00e9clare incapable dans l'\u00e9tat actuel du dossier d'arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que Nadeau pouvait, comme il l'a fait, ignorer \u00e0 la fois Rodrigue et la promesse de vente qu'il lui a consentie et se proclamer propri\u00e9taire de la maison sans que nous sachions ce qui est advenu de la promesse de vente. L'action en garantie (sur laquelle d'ailleurs on n'avait nullement attir\u00e9 notre attention lors de l'audition) engageait un litige entre Dulac et Rodrigue seulement et uniquement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la maison. Je ne vois pas comment nous pourrions d\u00e9clarer que Nadeau est maintenant propri\u00e9taire de cette maison sans le faire contradictoirement avec Rodrigue.\nNous n'avons pas \u00e0 citer ici la jurisprudence constante, et en particulier de la Cour Supr\u00eame, \u00e0 l'effet que l'on ne peut annuler ou d\u00e9clarer nul un contrat lorsque toutes les parties \u00e0 ce contrat ne sont pas en cause. Il y a lieu de se demander si, entre Dulac et Nadeau seulement, nous d\u00e9cidions que ce dernier a automatiquement repris le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la maison, quelle serait la situation qui subsisterait entre Nadeau et Rodrigue, principalement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la terre;\nTout d'abord, on ne saurait demander aux tribunaux de mettre partiellement de c\u00f4t\u00e9 un contrat entre deux parties. Il doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9 pour le tout ou pas du tout. Mais, en plus, nous le r\u00e9p\u00e9tons, il ne peut \u00eatre mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 ou tenu pour avoir cess\u00e9 automatiquement lorsque l'une des parties \u00e0 ce contrat n'est pas devant la Cour.\nA mon humble avis, ce raisonnement est fatal \u00e0 la cause de l'intim\u00e9. Je ne me demande m\u00eame pas s'il y aurait lieu encore, \u00e0 l'heure actuelle, d'ordonner la mise-en-cause de Rodrigue devant la Cour Supr\u00eame. Il est \u00e9vident qu'il faudrait d'abord entendre les objections de Rodrigue \u00e0 rencontre d'un ordre de ce genre; mais, ici, je ne vois pas comment Rodrigue ne serait pas en droit de demander, qu'\u00e0 cette fin, la cause retourne en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Il est difficile de croire qu'une proc\u00e9dure de ce genre n'entra\u00eenerait pas toute une enqu\u00eate sur les faits. La Cour Supr\u00eame n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e dans ce but.\nEn plus, il s'ensuivrait, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, que l'enregistrement de l'avis par Nadeau \u00e9tait pour le moins pr\u00e9matur\u00e9. Il ne pouvait, comme il l'a tent\u00e9, s'arroger \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame sans contradiction avec Rodrigue un titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la maison; et, au surplus, les autres motifs qui militent contre l'intim\u00e9 seraient quand m\u00eame suffisants pour faire rejeter l'attitude qu'il a prise.\nJ'infirmerais donc le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi et je r\u00e9tablirais le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, avec d\u00e9pens, tant dans cette Cour que dans la Cour d'appel.\nTaschereau, J. (dissenting) :\u2014Pour les raisons donn\u00e9es par mon coll\u00e8gue, M. le Juge Fauteux, je suis d'opinion que cet appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. Je d\u00e9sire cependant souligner bri\u00e8vement les motifs qui m'am\u00e8nent \u00e0 cette conclusion.\nRodrigue d\u00e9tenait de Nadeau une promesse de vente, subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 certaines conditions que d'ailleurs, il n'a jamais remplies. En supposant que quand il a vendu \u00e0 Dulac les termes ne fussent pas \u00e9chus, il n'est jamais devenu propri\u00e9taire, car la promesse, comme dans le cas qui nous occupe, peut n'\u00eatre que conditionn\u00e9e comme la vente elle-m\u00eame. Alors, s'il y a tradition de la chose, la promesse de vente n'\u00e9quivaut pas \u00e0 vente. Il en r\u00e9sulte que Rodrigue a vendu la chose d'autrui, et qu'aucun effet juridique n'a r\u00e9sult\u00e9 de cette transaction, que je m'exempte de qualifier, entre Rodrigue et Dulac, qui puisse affecter les droits de Nadeau (1487 C.C.).\nDe plus, l'article 416 C.C. n'a aucune application. A part quelques cas exceptionnels qui ne se rencontrent pas ici, un b\u00e2timent est toujours un immeuble par nature (C.C. 376). M\u00eame si la maison de Nadeau a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9e sur la terre de Dulac, elle n'a pas perdu ce caract\u00e8re immobilier que la loi lui donne. Vide (Chaloult v. B\u00e9gin 6; McAskill v. Richmond 7; Laprise v. Morin 8.\nOn peut peut-\u00eatre avoir en droit anglais une conception diff\u00e9rente de la loi, mais s\u00fbrement pas en droit fran\u00e7ais. Il me semble \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire que, quand l'article 416 C.C. stipule que le propri\u00e9taire du sol qui construit avec les mat\u00e9riaux d'autrui, en acquiert la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, sujet \u00e0 certaines conditions, cette r\u00e8gle ne s'applique qu'\u00e0 l'incorporation de mat\u00e9riaux qui sont des biens meubles et non pas \u00e0 un autre immeuble. C'est la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et l'opinion unanime de tous les commentateurs.\nEnfin, il me semble compl\u00e8tement inutile d'ordonner que Rodrigue soit mis en cause. Il a re\u00e7u de la part de Dulac une action en, garantie formelle, lui enjoignant de d\u00e9fendre le titre qu'il avait consenti, et il n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de compara\u00eetre. Ce n'est pas le r\u00f4le de cette Cour d'intervenir pour prot\u00e9ger ceux qui, par leur propre n\u00e9gligence, permettent que leurs droits soient mis en p\u00e9ril. Je confirmerais avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours.\nRand, J. :\u2014The undisputed facts in this appeal establish the incorporation of the structure taken by the appellant from the lands claimed by the respondent in such manner that it could not be removed intact or without substantial damage and a disruption of the entirety in which it is now embodied. On the assumption that ownership had not passed to Rodrigue, the purchaser from the respondent, what, then, is the legal result of the incorporation, and has the respondent a property interest in the appellant's land which may be protected by registration.\nThe general law of France dealing with such an incorporation of one thing with another is derived from that of the Romans and has been settled since the law of the Twelve Tables. As formulated by Pothier, T. 9, 3rd Ed., cap. 2, sec. 3, art. 3, para. 169 at p. 156,\nLorsque, par mon fait, ou par celui d'une autre personne, une ou plusieurs choses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 unies \u00e0 la mienne, de mani\u00e8re qu'elles nen fassent qu'une seule et m\u00eame chose, et un seul et m\u00eame tout, dont ma chose soit la partie principale, et dont les autres ne soient que les parties accessoires, j'acquiers par droit d'accession vi ac potestate rei meae, le domaine des choses qui en sont les accessoires\u2026 What is effected is a transfer by law of the propri\u00e9t\u00e9 in the accessory to the owner of the principal thing or property, a transfer based upon the fact that the two things, by the unity, constitute a new whole.\nIt is equally well established that in the incorporation of movable property, with the primary and natural immovable, land, the latter is principal and the thing incorporated accessory.\nArt. 416 of the Civil Code embodies the general rule:\u2014\nThe proprietor of the soil who has constructed buildings or works with materials which do not belong to him, must pay the value thereof; he may also be condemned, to pay damages, if there be any, but the proprietor of the materials has no right to take them away.\nbut there is no implication that this provision exhauts the subject matter of accession to land. The proposition is stated by Caius thus:\u2014\nQuum aliquis in suo loco alien\u00e2 materi\u00e0 aedificaverit, ipse dominas intelligitur aedificii; e\u00e2d. L. 7, s. 10.\n(Pothier, p. 157, supra.)\nUnder the old law, (Pothier, supra), if the accessory was severable, an action ad exhibendum lay by which the owner of the principal could be forced to permit its detachment:\u2014\nDemma inclusa auro alieno vel sigillum candelabro, vindicari non potest; sed ut excludatur ad exhibendum agi potest; L. 6, ff. ad exhib.\nBut to this, by the law of the Twelve Tables, there was excepted the case of erections on land with materials of another. The law in that case did not permit an enforced detachment:\u2014 \"Tignum alienum aedibus junctum ne solvito:\" (Pothier, supra). Instead, the owner of the entirety became liable for double the price of the materials; but if, before restitution, the structure was demolished, the owner could recover such of his materials as had resumed their separateness. The early French law followed that of the Roman except, (Pothier, p. 161, supra), the double penalty, which, as is seen, is excluded by art. 416.\nThe same view is expressed by Demolombe, Trait\u00e9 de la distinction des Biens, T. 2, paras. 96 et seq; by Aubry & Rau, Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, T. 2, arts. 164 and 204, in which the authors say:\u2014\nLe propri\u00e9taire d'un fond devient, par droit d'accession, propri\u00e9taire des plantations, constructions et ouvrages qu'il y a faits, m\u00eame avec les mat\u00e9riaux d'autrui, et bien qu'il les ait employ\u00e9s de mauvaise foi. by Laurent, Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, T. 6, art. 259 : Baudry-Lacantinerie & Chauveau, Droit Civil, T. 6, art. 351 : Planiol-Ripert, Trait\u00e9 \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire de Droit Civil, T. 1, art. 2722: and Fuzier-Herman, R\u00e9pertoire du Droit Fran\u00e7ais, T. 1, cap. 3, p. 333, articles 112, 113, 114. This last author, agreeing with Aubry & Rau that art. 554, Code Napol\u00e9on, makes no distinction between good or bad faith, adds:\u2014\nCette distinction n'a d'int\u00e9r\u00eat que pour la fixation du chiffre des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nand the only bad faith suggested here is based on the failure to examine the title to the land before removing the structure. To the same effect is the general law stated by Dalloz in Jurisprudence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, T. 38, p. 267, para. 407, in Nouveau R\u00e9pertoire, T. 3, p. 621, arts. 135 and 136, and finally in Codes Annot\u00e9s, art. 581, Code Napol\u00e9on, p. 849.\nAgainst this uniform exposition, to which there are special exceptions not relevant here, two objections are urged: first, that the word \"materials\" in art. 416 is to be construed as embracing only what are at the time movables; and that as the building in this case belonged to the soil of the respondent, its unauthorized severance and re-attachment did not affect its immovable character or its ownership.\nThe interpretation of the word \"materials\" must be made in the light of the background of the rule of accession and the consideration which has lain behind it from the beginning, which was and is that, since the person who had been deprived of ordinary property could be fully indemnified in damages, the destruction involved in severance was against public interest. What the word signifies is the substance out of which the artificial addition to the natural immovable of land is made. The word used in the Roman law was \"tignum\" and it is interesting to observe that Gaius furnishes us with an interpretation of that term:\u2014\nAppellatione autem tigni omnes materia esignificantur ex quibus aedificia fiunt, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n(Pothier, supra, p. 161).\nIn that sense, everything is material which forms part of the resulting whole or entirety, and it makes no difference in what form it may have been at the moment of annexation. Here there was a de facto movable, although in other aspects and for other purposes, such as, for instance, succession, and before reincorporation though after severance, its nature as an immovable might be held to continue.\nThe second objection appears to be equally unfounded. It is rejected both by the Roman law and by the law of France in relation to plants or trees which, more so than artificial structures, are part of the soil by nature:\u2014\nLorsque la chose qui, par son union avec la mienne sans soudure, en est devenue l'accessoire, y est tellement unie qu'elle n'en est pas s\u00e9parable, le domaine que j'en acquiers par droit d'accession, vi ac potestate rei meae, est un domaine v\u00e9ritable et perp\u00e9tuel. Tel est celui que j'acquiers de la vigne ou des arbres qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plant\u00e9s dans mon champ; de la semence dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ensemenc\u00e9; de ce qui y a \u00e9t\u00e9 b\u00e2ti, etc.\nThe only doubt raised by the commentators is whether the rule of succession operates on the vines and trees before they have taken root. The view of Pothier that it does not is rejected by Demolombe and others. That difference is not material here; but the fact that, constituting as they do, immovables by nature, they become by accession immovable in the soil and ownership of one who has wrongfully taken them from the land of their true owner, renders the case of an artificial structure a fortiori one of accession.\nApplying these considerations to this case, they but reinforce the common sense view that, in this seeming conflict between the rules governing immovables and that of accession to the soil, it would violate a basic legal conception to hold that the framework so incorporated in the permanent structure of the appellant retained its character as an immovable related to its original situs and its ownership in the respondent: immovables by nature are bound up with certain fixed space and the attribution of that character to what fills the space when by severance it has been made in fact movable is a constructive predication of law which like every other rule is based on legal policy and becomes modified in circumstances dictating, on the ground of policy, another rule. Any right to damages which, depending upon the proper interpretation of the contract between the respondent and Rodrigue, the former may have against the appellant, is adequate to every requirement of equity and justice.\nConceivably the law might, with propriety, create in favour of the respondent what is known to the English law as a charge\u2014equivalent to a lien\u2014against the land of the appellant which would be of the nature of a security for the damages suffered: but that is derived from a jurisdiction in and principles of equity which are not recognized by the French law. In any event, it has not been claimed.\nApart from damages, by what remedy is this real right to be enforced? Is it to recover his property physically, even though that involves the partial destruction of the property of both parties? Is it a right of preferential participation in proceeds as in Chaloult v. B\u00e9gin 9? Can there be an enforced sale by the court? If the preference arises only when the building may, at the will of the appellant, be sold, would it be affected by its loss or destruction? Would the preference extend to the proceeds of the sale of the land alone? These questions indicate what, to me, is an insuperable objection to the conclusion of the court below.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at trial with costs in this Court and in the Court of Queen's Bench.\nEstey, J. :\u2014The appellant Dulac in this action asks that he be declared the owner of the property hereinafter described and that the notice filed against the said property by the respondent Nadeau be removed; in the alternative, that the respondent Nadeau be condemned to pay to the appellant Dulac the sum of $3,500.00 and remove the said buildings from his land.\nThe respondent Nadeau, on July 24, 1947, sold to Pierre Rodrigue a certain eighty acres with the buildings thereon under an agreement containing such terms that, notwithstanding Rodrigue went immediately into possession, in my view, do not permit of its being classified as a sale within the meaning of Art. 1478 C.C. Grange v. McLennan 10.\nOn May 24, 1948, Rodrigue purported to sell a house and shed of the buildings thereon for $500.00 to appellant Dulac, which amount the latter paid. It was specifically provided that Dulac would remove the house from the land. This he did by moving it to his own premises. There he united it with a second building which he had purchased from Morin and made such alterations and improvements as to construct a new building distinct from either of the two which had formed the basis therefor.\nRodrigue made no payment under the agreement dated July 24, 1947, and when the respondent Nadeau learned of the removal to, and the incorporation of the house and shed into another building upon Dulac's premises he registered, on October 27, 1949, a notice against the property of the appellant Dulac, claiming that he was still the owner of the buildings Rodrigue purported to sell to Dulac.\nRodrigue, having obtained no title from Nadeau, could not, under his purported sale, convey any title to Dulac. Rodrigue did, however, purport to sell and, in fact, was paid $500 for the house and shed and, as a consequence, Dulac was permitted to and did take possession. It would appear that Dulac, in utilizing Nadeau's house and shed in the construction of his building as aforesaid, became, by virtue of the law of accession, the owner thereof.\nThe general principle is stated by Pothier in his Works, Vol. 9, 1st Part, C. 11, S. 111, para. 169:\u2014\nLorsque, par mon fait, ou par celui d'une autre personne, une ou plusieurs choses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 unies \u00e0 la mienne, de mani\u00e8re qu'elles n'en fassent qu'une seule et m\u00eame chose, et un seul et m\u00eame tout, dont ma chose soit la partie principale, et dont les autres ne soient que les parties accessoires, j'acquiers par droit d'accession, vi ac potestate rei meae, le domaine des choses qui en sont les accessoires.\nThen, under the rules for determining principal and accessory, he gives as part of his first example:\u2014\nLorsque je construis sur mon terrain un b\u00e2timent avec des mat\u00e9riaux qui ne m'appartiennent pas, le domaine de mon terrain me fait acqu\u00e9rir par droit d'accession, vi ac potestate rei meae, celui de tous les mat\u00e9riaux que j'y ai employ\u00e9s, comme choses qui en sont accessoires.\nMignault, Vol. 2, p. 494, states:\u2014\nLe propri\u00e9taire des mat\u00e9riaux employ\u00e9s (ou des arbres plant\u00e9s) a cess\u00e9 d'en avoir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Leur incorporation au sol constitue, en effet, une accession, et l'accession est un mode d'acqu\u00e9rir; c'est donc au propri\u00e9taire du sol qu'ils appartiennent d\u00e9sormais. Ils n'existent plus, d'ailleurs, \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de mat\u00e9riaux; leur substance est civilement d\u00e9truite; elle a disparu dans le b\u00e2timent, qui lui-m\u00eame n'est qu'une partie du sol.\nSee also Langelier, Cours de Droit Civil, Vol. 2, p. 148.\nIn Montpetit and Taillefer, Trait\u00e9 de Droit Civil du Qu\u00e9bec, Vol. 3, at p. 152, it is stated:\u2014\nCette solution fait \u00e9chec au droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais le l\u00e9gislateur l'a adopt\u00e9e parce qu'elle \u00e9tait la meilleure en droit et en \u00e9quit\u00e9. In the Civil Code Art. 408 provides:\u2014\n408. Ownership in a thing whether moveable or immoveable gives the right to all it produces, and to all that is joined to it as an accessory whether naturally or artificially. This right is called the right of accession.\nUnder the heading \"Of the Right of Accession Over What Becomes United and Incorporated With a Thing,\" Art. 413 provides:\u2014\n413. Whatever becomes united to or incorporated with a thing belongs to the proprietor, according to the rules hereinafter established.\nThen Art. 416, under the same heading as Art. 413, and one of the rules referred to in that article, provides:\u2014\n416. The proprietor of the soil who has constructed buildings or works with materials, which do not belong to him, must pay the value thereof; he may also be condemned, to pay damages, if there be any, but the proprietor of the materials has no right to take them away.\nThe word \"thing\", as used in Arts. 408 and 413, must be given the same meaning and, therefore, as expressed in Art. 408, includes both movables and immovables. Then the word \"whatever\", as used in Art. 413 without limitation, would include anything movable or immovable that might be joined to another movable or immovable.\nUnder the general provision of Art. 413 the act of accession determines the question of ownership. If that act of accession is one of a type which comes within the terms of Art. 416, this latter provides that the owner of the materials, as Nadeau, \"has no right to take them away,\" but may recover from Dulac \"the value thereof\" and, in a proper case, damages. In brief, Art. 416, once an accession of the type there described has taken place, preserves the property and directs compensation.\nIt is, however, contended that the foregoing Art. 416 does not apply because the house and shed, though transported by Dulac to his own land and there used in the construction of a building, remained throughout an immovable by nature in which Nadeau retained a real right and that he was, therefore, entitled to register the notice, the removal of which is requested in this action.\nThis contention raises a question as to the scope and meaning of Art. 416 and in particular of whether the word \"materials,\" as there used, includes both immovables and movables, or movables only. A construction of the word \"materials,\" that would restrict it to, and, in effect, make it synonymous with the word \"movables\" would appear to be unwarranted. As ordinarily used and understood in such a context, the word \"materials\" includes everything movable or immovable, necessary or incidental to the completion of the buildings or works. The sections immediately preceding, in particular 408 and 413, make it clear that the law of accession is applicable to both movables and immovables. A construction of the word \"materials\" that would limit or restrict its meaning to movables in Art. 416 would give to one in Nadeau's position compensation under that article if the materials of his used by Dulac were movables, but, if immovables, he would have to find his redress elsewhere. In this connection it is important to note that no other article deals with his position and the detail with which the immediately succeeding articles deal with the various possibilities leads to the conclusion that, had the Legislature intended to so restrict the word \"materials,\" it would have included a further provision specifically covering the use of immovables in the construction of a building.\nThat the word \"materials\" should include both movables and immovables is strenthened by a consideration of the principle underlying the law of accession and the prohibition and compensation provided for in Art. 416. This latter article in particular is intended to provide a fair and practical solution of the situation created by an owner who, in constructing a building on his own land, uses materials of another, by providing compensation to the owner of the materials and avoiding the destruction of the immovable. The principle applies with equal force to the use and presence of both movables and immovables.\nMoreover, it may be observed that Art. 554 of the Code Napol\u00e9on applied to both movables and immovables and the word \"materials,\" as there used, would appear to apply to both. It is significant that when the word \"plantations\" was omitted from Art. 416 the word \"materials\" remained, without any qualification whatever. The Legislature, in deleting the word \"plantations\" but leaving the word \"materials,\" without qualification, evidenced an intention not to affect the meaning of the word \"materials,\" which would then include the shed and buildings herein described upon the basis that they were, at the time of the accession, immovables. Moreover, this view finds some support in the remarks of certain of the authors which would indicate that in reality land is the only immovable by nature. Langelier, Cours de Droit Civil, Vol. 2, p. 101 : \"On pourait dire qu'il n'y a d'immeubles par nature, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, que les fonds de terre,\" and Mignault, Droit Civil Canadien, Vol. 2, p. 400: \"A proprement parler, les fonds de terre sont, parmi les biens, les seuls qui soient de v\u00e9ritables immeubles par leur nature:\" It may be that Mr. Justice Marchand, in Thiffault v. Gagnon 11, had in mind the foregoing remarks of the learned authors where, in the circumstances of that case, he held a shop, sold with the intent of its being moved to another location, should be treated as a movable.\nIt would appear that having regard to the foregoing, as well as the history and principle underlying the law of accession, that the word \"materials\" is here used in a broad and comprehensive sense which would include the attachment or incorporation of a small building with a larger one, when the latter is attached to the land.\nWe were referred to the case of Leprise v. Morin 12. There the owner had moved his building attached to a parcel of his own land subject to a hypothec to another parcel of his own land and it was held that, notwithstanding the transfer of the building, it remained subject to the hypothec. That case is quite distinguishable in that it does not involve any question of accession and, therefore no question under Art. 416.\nThat the authors, in the main, restrict their discussion under Art. 416 C.C. or 554 C.N. to the use of movables in the construction of a building is but to be expected. In normal circumstances movables only would be used. The case here presented is unusual. While there are statements which would indicate that only movables have been considered, with great respect I do not find any statement that goes so far as to indicate that if a case of immovables were specifically under consideration that the word \"materials\" would be construed to mean movables only.\nDulac used the house and shed in question and another building, along with other material, in the construction of an entirely different building upon his own land. He valued this other building at $3,500.00, an amount much in excess of the purchase price of the other buildings. In the course of constructing this other building he found it necessary to alter the building received from Rodrigue by providing what he described as a new chassis, a new roof and about half of the uprights, replacing the doors and windows, rebuilding the verandah and shed and finally covering the entire building with a material he described as \"de l'imitation de briques\".\nIn these circumstances there was an accession and thereby the ownership of the building claimed by Nadeau passed to Dulac. It is that act of accession which changes the ownership, as stated by Mackeld, Roman Law, p. 155: \"that in virtue of this connection it is regarded as part and parcel of the thing,\" or, as Pothier states in the foregoing quotation: \"j'acquiers par droit d'accession\". It matters not who the owner may have been previous to the accession, nor, with great respect to those who hold a contrary view, does it matter that the materials may, after the accession, be identified. Moreover, whether a person in the position of Dulac has acted in good or bad faith does not affect his title to the property, but may be important in fixing compensation.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nFauteux, J. (dissenting) :\u2014Les faits donnant lieu \u00e0 ce litige sont les suivants:\nLe 24 juillet 1947, l'intim\u00e9 Nadeau devenait propri\u00e9taire d'un certain lot de terre et de toutes les b\u00e2tisses y \u00e9rig\u00e9es.

Le m\u00eame jour, l'intim\u00e9 et un certain Pierre Rodrigue, faisaient, relativement aux m\u00eames lot et b\u00e2tisses, une convention dont il convient\u2014pour fins de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence\u2014de reproduire et num\u00e9roter les clauses essentielles.\n1\u00b0 Monsieur Nadeau promet vendre, avec garantie de ses faits personnels seulement, \u00e0 M. Rodrigue qui s'oblige d'acheter, la terre qu'il a acquise aujourd'hui, de monsieur Lucien Desrochers, cultivateur de St-Georges de Beauce, autrefois de St-Prosper, par acte devant moi, laquelle fait partie. . . . . . . . . . . . avec les b\u00e2tisses y construites. . . . . . . . . . . . 2\u00b0 La vente se fera pour le prix de mille quatre vingt quinze dollars que M. Rodrigue paiera en deux versements; cent cinquante dollars le vingt-quatre juillet mil neuf cent quarante-huit et neuf cent quarante-cinq dollars, le vingt-quatre juillet mil neuf cent quarante-neuf, le tout sans int\u00e9r\u00eat.\n3\u00b0 Cette promesse de vente ne devra pas \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9e et Facte de vente se fera sur paiement du dernier versement.\n4\u00b0 M. Rodrigue paiera toutes taxes et contributions publiques auxquelles pourrait \u00eatre tenu ledit Odilon Nadeau; la prime d'assurance que prendra M. Nadeau pour le montant d\u00fb, et ses renouvellements s'il y a lieu ; il maintiendra les b\u00e2tisses en bon \u00e9tat de r\u00e9parations au moins telles qu'elles sont actuellement; il entretiendra la terre en \u00e9tat de culture comme elle est actuellement au moins.\n5\u00b0 A d\u00e9faut par M. Rodrigue d'acquitter les versements \u00e0 l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance, et de se conformer \u00e0 toutes les conditions stipul\u00e9es aux pr\u00e9sentes, tel que convenu, cette promesse deviendra nulle et M. Nadeau disposera de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 comme il l'entendra sans indemnit\u00e9 pour les am\u00e9liorations qui auront pu avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faites sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, sans aucun remboursement, sans proc\u00e9dures judiciaires, de plein droit.\n6\u00b0 Il est express\u00e9ment convenu que si M. Nadeau se pr\u00e9vaut de la clause de nullit\u00e9 ci-dessus et revend la terre \u00e0 un prix inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 tout ce qu'elle lui co\u00fbtera lors de la vente, il aura recours contre Pierre Rodrigue, pour toute la balance qu'il justifiera lui \u00eatre due; et ledit Pierre Rodrigue s'engage \u00e0 le rembourser sur demande, se tenant responsable et redevable de telle balance.\nFait \u00e0 St-Prosper, etc\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nAu temps de l'audition, Rodrigue n'avait encore satisfait \u00e0 aucune des obligations par lui assum\u00e9es. Il avait, n\u00e9anmoins, coup\u00e9 et pris du bois sur la terre et\u2014fait mat\u00e9riel conduisant \u00e0 proc\u00e8s\u2014\u00e0 une date assez impr\u00e9cise en 1948, il disposait en faveur de l'appelant Dulac, de certaines b\u00e2tisses situ\u00e9es sur ce lot et, ce, suivant les termes d'un \u00e9crit sous seing priv\u00e9 se lisant comme suit:\nJe, soussign\u00e9, Emmanuel Dulac, de St-Prosper, ach\u00e8te de J.-Pierre Rodrigue commer\u00e7ant de Beauceville, une maison avec ch\u00e8de \u00e0 bois situ\u00e9e sur le lot port\u00e9 9 rang neuf paroisse St-Prosper et l'enlever d'ici au 1er ao\u00fbt 1948 pour le prix et somme de $500.00 cinq cents piastres payer en argent.\net nous avont sign\u00e9.\nt\u00e9moin:\nJ. PIERRE RODRIGUE\nFERNAND VEILLEUX\nEMMANUEL DULAC.\nC'est sous l'autorit\u00e9 de cette convention avec Rodrigue que l'appelant Dulac s'empare des b\u00e2timents y d\u00e9crits pour les transporter sur son propre terrain et adjoindre \u00e0 la maison de Nadeau une autre b\u00e2tisse qu'il y transporte subs\u00e9quemment et, de ce tout, qu'il r\u00e9pare et am\u00e9liore, faire sa r\u00e9sidence.\nL'intim\u00e9 Nadeau n'apprit que plus tard ces agissements de l'appelant Dulac et de Rodrigue et, ce, \u00e0 l'occasion d'une d\u00e9marche faite par lui pour rencontrer son d\u00e9biteur Rodrigue relativement au d\u00e9faut d'icelui de satisfaire aux obligations assum\u00e9es en la promesse de vente pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e. Vainement l'intim\u00e9 Nadeau chercha-t-il aussi \u00e0 rencontrer l'appelant Dulac pour \u00e9tablir et faire valoir ses droits sur ses b\u00e2timents. Il enregistra donc, sur l'emplacement o\u00f9 l'appelant Dulac l'y avait transport\u00e9, un avis d\u00e9non\u00e7ant \u00e0 toutes fins son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur sa \"maison d'habitation\". C'est l'enregistrement de cet avis qui d\u00e9clencha les proc\u00e9dures judiciaires.\nPar son action, l'appelant, all\u00e9guant la vente de cette b\u00e2tisse \u00e0 lui consentie par Rodrigue, ainsi que les r\u00e9parations et am\u00e9liorations ci-dessus indiqu\u00e9es, demande que son terrain et sa maison d'habitation \"soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s lui appartenir franc et quitte de tous droits quelconques en faveur\" de l'intim\u00e9; que ce dernier soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 radier \u00e0 ses frais tous les droits lui r\u00e9sultant de l'enregistrement de l'avis: que l'appelant soit autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 suppl\u00e9er au d\u00e9faut de l'intim\u00e9 de ce faire, par l'enregistrement, du jugement \u00e0 intervenir et, enfin, qu'advenant l'impossibilit\u00e9 d'annuler et radier cet enregistrement, l'intim\u00e9 soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 lui payer la somme de $3,500.00 pour am\u00e9liorations aux b\u00e2timents, et soit, dans ce cas, condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 les enlever du terrain de l'appelant; avec d\u00e9pens dans tous les cas. Sur r\u00e9ception de l'action, l'intim\u00e9 produisit une confession de jugement ainsi libell\u00e9e:\nLe d\u00e9fendeur, n'ayant jamais pr\u00e9tendu et ne pr\u00e9tendant pas \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'emplacement dont le demandeur se dit propri\u00e9taire, consent \u00e0 ce que le demandeur obtienne jugement le d\u00e9clarant propri\u00e9taire de l'emplacement, le tout sans frais.\nCette confession de jugement \u00e9tant refus\u00e9e par l'appelant, l'intim\u00e9 plaida en substance le maintien\u2014nonobstant la promesse de vente\u2014de son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur ces b\u00e2tisses et, par suite, l'inexistence du droit de Rodrigue d'en disposer et la validit\u00e9 de l'avis par lui enregistr\u00e9 pour la protection de ses droits.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance rejeta cette d\u00e9fense et motiva le maintien de l'action en d\u00e9clarant que l'appelant Dulac avait, de bonne foi, achet\u00e9 ces b\u00e2tisses de Rodrigue, que ce dernier, ayant d'ailleurs une promesse de vente accompagn\u00e9e de tradition et possession, \u00e9tait devenu le propri\u00e9taire de ces b\u00e2timents avec droit de les revendre \u00e0 Dulac, et que l'adjonction d'iceux \u00e0 une autre propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant en rendait la division et la remise \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 impossibles. En cons\u00e9quence, les b\u00e2tisses en litige furent d\u00e9clar\u00e9es \u00eatre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant, \"franc et quitte de tous droits quelconques en faveur\" de l'intim\u00e9, ce dernier \u00e9tant condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 radier \u00e0 ses frais tous les droits lui r\u00e9sultant de l'enregistrement de l'avis et l'appelant fut autoris\u00e9 de suppl\u00e9er au d\u00e9faut de l'intim\u00e9 de ce faire, par l'enregistrement du jugement; le tout avec d\u00e9pens.\nNadeau appela de cette d\u00e9cision. La Cour d'Appel 13, lui donnant raison, d\u00e9clara par jugement formel que Dulac n'avait pas \u00e9tabli \u00eatre devenu propri\u00e9taire de la maison transport\u00e9e, que Rodrigue, son auteur, n'y avait lui-m\u00eame aucun droit sauf une promesse de vente assujettie \u00e0 des conditions jamais remplies, que l'avis enregistr\u00e9 par Nadeau \u00e9tait valide et que Dulac ne pouvait en exiger la radiation, ni demander \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire de cette b\u00e2tisse, \"franc et quitte de tous droits quelconques en faveur\" de Nadeau. La confession de jugement fut donc d\u00e9clar\u00e9e suffisante, le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure infirm\u00e9 et l'action pour le surplus rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens. D'o\u00f9 le pr\u00e9sent appel. A l'\u00e9tablissement de son droit \u00e0 la maison en litige, l'appelant invoque la vente qui lui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par Rodrigue. Celui-ci, cependant, ne pouvait avoir et consentir \u00e0 l'appelant d'autres droits sur icelle que ceux lui r\u00e9sultant de la promesse de vente intervenue entre lui-m\u00eame et l'intim\u00e9 Nadeau. Si donc, aux termes de cette convention, Rodrigue n'est jamais devenu propri\u00e9taire de cette b\u00e2tisse, il a vendu \u00e0 Dulac la chose d'autrui. Pareille vente \u00e9tant, aux termes de l'article 1487 du Code Civil, nulle en principe et aucune des exceptions \u00e0 ce principe auxquelles r\u00e9f\u00e8re cet article n'ayant ici d'application, Dulac ne peut, dans cette alternative, victorieusement opposer \u00e0 Nadeau cette vente, ni d'ailleurs\u2014comme nous le verrons\u2014la bonne foi et le fait de l'adjonction de cette b\u00e2tisse \u00e0 la sienne. Ainsi appara\u00eet-il que la question fondamentale \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer est celle de savoir si Rodrigue a, par cette promesse de vente, acquis un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur cette b\u00e2tisse que Dulac a ainsi transport\u00e9e sur son sol.\nPour r\u00e9pondre affirmativement \u00e0 cette question, le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance s'est appuy\u00e9 sur les dispositions de l'article 1478 prescrivant que \"la promesse de vente avec tradition et possession \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 vente\". On ne conteste pas le fait que la promesse de vente ait \u00e9t\u00e9, en l'esp\u00e8ce, accompagn\u00e9e de tradition et possession, mais cela n'\u00e9puise pas la question. En effet, comme la vente elle-m\u00eame, la promesse de vente peut bien ne pas \u00eatre pure et simple et aucun principe n'emp\u00eache les parties de conditionner et suspendre, par exemple, le transfert du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aux choses en faisant l'objet, \u00e0 l'av\u00e8nement d'un fait futur. La convention demeure donc la loi des parties et leur intention sur le point doit \u00eatre recherch\u00e9e dans ce qu'elles y ont exprim\u00e9.\nLa doctrine sur l'effet des dispositions de cet article est ainsi exprim\u00e9e par Mignault, au Vol. 7, page 29 :\nJe n'ai envisag\u00e9 jusqu'ici que la promesse de vente pure et simple. Il me reste \u00e0 parler de la promesse de vente conditionnelle, car, comme la vente elle-m\u00eame, la promesse de vente peut \u00eatre consentie sous une condition suspensive ou r\u00e9solutoire. La condition que nous rencontrons le plus souvent, c'est la condition' suspensive, et alors le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la promesse, m\u00eame lorsqu'il a eu tradition et possession actuelle de la chose, n'en devient propri\u00e9taire que lorsque la condition s'est accomplie. Ainsi le promettant a stipul\u00e9 que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiair ene deviendrait propri\u00e9taire que sur paiement du prix. Dans ce cas, malgr\u00e9 la tradition, le promettant conserve le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 tout comme le ferait le vendeur sous une vente conditionnelle. J'ai cit\u00e9 supra, note (a), p. 6, les d\u00e9cisions relatives \u00e0 la r\u00e9tention du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par le vendeur.\nQuelle interpr\u00e9tation devra-t-on donner \u00e0 la clause par laquelle le vendeur s'engage \u00e0 donner un titre lorsque le prix sera pay\u00e9? Il faudra avant tout rechercher l'intention des parties. Malgr\u00e9 que la promesse de vente ait \u00e9t\u00e9 accompagn\u00e9e de tradition et possession, s'il appert que les parties ont voulu r\u00e9server \u00e0 un acte post\u00e9rieur l'effet de transf\u00e9rer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, on devra d\u00e9cider que le promettant a conserv\u00e9 le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en sa personne.\nLa jurisprudence est d'accord avec cette doctrine. Voir, entre autres, l'arr\u00eat de cette Cour dans Grange v. McLennan 14 et celui de la Cour du Banc du Roi (si\u00e9geant en appel) dans Goyette v. Sherbrooke Trust Co. and Bradford 15.\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rons maintenant \u00e0 la promesse de vente intervenue entre l'intim\u00e9 Nadeau et Rodrigue, l'auteur de l'appelant. On y voit que les parties ont express\u00e9ment suspendu, ajourn\u00e9 et conditionn\u00e9 la vente,\u2014ce fait juridique op\u00e9rant le transfert de propri\u00e9t\u00e9\u2014aussi bien que l'acte devant le constater, au paiement int\u00e9gral du prix arr\u00eat\u00e9 dans l'entente. \"La vente se fera\u2026\", \"l'acte de vente se fera\u2026\", a-t-on textuellement convenu et, ce, respectivement aux clauses 2 et 3 pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es. On a, de plus, inclus en cette derni\u00e8re clause une prohibition absolue et d\u00e9finitive d'enregistrer la promesse de vente. La pr\u00e9sence de ces dispositions en la convention ne s'expliquent pas \u00e0 moins d'y voir la manifestation de l'intention et volont\u00e9 de Nadeau, non seulement de suspendre le transfert du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ses biens \u00e0 Rodrigue, mais de mettre, par cette prohibition, ce dernier dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 d'efficacement pr\u00e9tendre, vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers, en \u00eatre propri\u00e9taire et en disposer avant paiement du prix. Il y a donc, en cette convention, soit dit avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, une condition suspensive attach\u00e9e au transfert du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et, alors, il n'importe plus de savoir si, au moment o\u00f9 Rodrigue vendait \u00e0 l'appelant Dulac, il \u00e9tait en d\u00e9faut ou non de faire l'un des versements du prix puisque ce n'est qu'au complet paiement qu'il pouvait devenir propri\u00e9taire avec droit de vendre.\nEnfin on a,\u2014comme il se devait\u2014, aux clauses 5 et 6, pr\u00e9vu le cas du d\u00e9faut de Rodrigue de faire les paiements \u00e0 l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance et de satisfaire aux autres conditions du contrat. On pourvoit alors \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution de la promesse et on d\u00e9finit les droits des parties. Mais la pr\u00e9sence, en ces derni\u00e8res clauses, d'une condition r\u00e9solutoire annulant cette convention, au d\u00e9faut de Rodrigue de satisfaire \u00e0 l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance \u00e0 l'un des versements du prix, n'affecte ni l'existence ni les cons\u00e9quences juridiques de la condition suspensive assujettissant au complet paiement du prix le transfert du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Ce sont l\u00e0 deux questions diff\u00e9rentes. Nadeau peut bien, advenant le d\u00e9faut de Rodrigue de satisfaire \u00e0 ses obligations, \u00eatre libre de prendre ou de ne pas prendre avantage de cette condition r\u00e9solutoire et s'abstenir de mettre fin au lien contractuel, en ne liquidant pas l'affaire ainsi que pr\u00e9vu en telle \u00e9ventualit\u00e9. C'est l\u00e0 son privil\u00e8ge. Mais comment Rodrigue peut-il pr\u00e9tendre que son propre d\u00e9faut,\u2014donnant ouverture \u00e0 ce privil\u00e8ge de Nadeau\u2014, m\u00eame accompagn\u00e9 de l'abstention de ce dernier de l'exercer en pl\u00e9nitude, pourrait avoir l'effet d'op\u00e9rer un transfert du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que, seul, l'accomplissement fid\u00e8le de ses obligations peut lui assurer, suivant la convention.\nIl faut donc arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que Rodrigue, n'ayant jamais satisfait \u00e0 aucune obligation, n'a jamais acquis un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur les b\u00e2tisses de l'intim\u00e9 Nadeau, et qu'en les vendant \u00e0 l'appelant Dulac, il lui a vendu la chose d'autrui. Pareille vente \u00e9tant nulle, dans les circonstances de cette cause,\u2014il ne s'agit ici ni d'une affaire commerciale, ni d'un bien mobilier\u2014, Dulac ne peut l'opposer \u00e0 Nadeau.\nReste \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer l'argument de bonne foi et celui qu'on pr\u00e9tend tirer du fait de l'adjonction des b\u00e2tisses de Nadeau \u00e0 celle de Dulac.\nL'appelant soumet qu'il ignorait que Rodrigue n'\u00e9tait pas propri\u00e9taire, et qu'au contraire, l'ayant vu couper et prendre du bois sur ce lot, il le tenait comme tel. En quoi ceci peut-il affecter la question? Aux termes de l'article 1487, l'acheteur de bonne foi peut recouvrer des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats de celui qui lui a vendu la chose d'autrui, mais cette bonne foi,\u2014hors les cas d'exceptions, ici d'aucune application\u2014n'a pas la vertu de valider cette vente d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle. D'ailleurs, l'appelant peut-il m\u00eame ici pr\u00e9tendre \u00e0 cette bonne foi? L'intim\u00e9 Nadeau apparaissait au bureau d'enregistrement comme propri\u00e9taire et Rodrigue n'y avait lui-m\u00eame aucun titre enregistr\u00e9. Ces faits\u2014ainsi publi\u00e9s\u2014Dulac ne les a pas v\u00e9rifi\u00e9s. En droit, il \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 les conna\u00eetre, et ne peut l\u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendre les avoir ignor\u00e9s. Il y a ici une pr\u00e9somption juris et de jure. Il ne peut donc plaider bonne foi (Bulmer et al v. Dufresne et al), 16; Meloche v. Simpson 17; Groulx v. Bricault 18. La doctrine expos\u00e9e dans ces d\u00e9cisions a \u00e9t\u00e9, encore tout r\u00e9cemment, reconnue et appliqu\u00e9e par la Cour d'Appel dans Baril v. Bolduc et Cornellier 19. Ajoutons que Dulac n'a m\u00eame exig\u00e9 de Rodrigue aucun titre justifiant d'un droit \u00e0 ces b\u00e2tisses. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 imprudent. Comment peut-il valablement invoquer cette imprudence contre Nadeau?\nEnfin et pour se faire reconna\u00eetre un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur les b\u00e2tisses de Nadeau, l'appelant se pr\u00e9vaut, en fait, de l'adjonction d'icelles \u00e0 la sienne sur son sol et, en droit, des dispositions.de l'article 416 du Code civil:\nLe propri\u00e9taire du sol qui a fait des constructions et ouvrages avec des mat\u00e9riaux qui ne lui appartiennent pas doit en payer la valeur; il peut aussi \u00eatre condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, s'il y a lieu; mais le propri\u00e9taire des mat\u00e9riaux n'a pas le droit de les enlever.\nCet article fait sans doute \u00e9chec au droit du propri\u00e9taire des mat\u00e9riaux utilis\u00e9s par le propri\u00e9taire du sol dans ses constructions et ouvrages. Mais comment l'appelant peut-il pr\u00e9tendre \u00eatre dans le cadre de ces dispositions et avoir fait des constructions et ouvrages avec les mat\u00e9riaux de Nadeau quand c'est le b\u00e2timent lui-m\u00eame qu'il a transport\u00e9 pour y adjoindre, et non y incorporer, une autre b\u00e2tisse subs\u00e9quemment \u00e9galement transport\u00e9e sur son sol.\nEn fait:\u2014A la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et comme r\u00e9sultat de ces op\u00e9rations de Dulac,\u2014d\u00e9placement et adjonction\u2014, ce b\u00e2timent n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9moli. Il a sans doute \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet de grosses r\u00e9parations mais il a conserv\u00e9 son identit\u00e9 et c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment parce qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu par le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier de la municipalit\u00e9 que Nadeau apprit de ce dernier l'endroit o\u00f9 Dulac l'avait transport\u00e9. Nadeau a reconnu sa maison. Desrochers, qui l'avait habit\u00e9e et la lui avait vendue, l'a reconnue \u00e9galement. Dulac lui-m\u00eame admet ces faits. Voyons son propre t\u00e9moignage, page 15:\nQ. A l'heure actuelle, vous avez deux maisons?\u2014R. Oui, coll\u00e9es ensemble.\nQ. O\u00f9 avez-vous pris l'autre maison?\u2014R.

Comme une cuisine d'\u00e9t\u00e9 qui fait partie d'une maison?\u2014R. Oui.\nEn droit:\u2014De toute \u00e9vidence, ces \"mat\u00e9riaux\" dont parle l'article 416 sont des meubles alors que, d'autre part, le b\u00e2timent, auquel l'article pr\u00e9voit l'incorporation des mat\u00e9riaux, est lui-m\u00eame, suivant l'article 376 C.C., un immeuble par nature. L'appelant n'a jamais contest\u00e9 cette proposition de droit.\nCependant on soutient de sa part, pour le maintien de son appel, que le mot \"mat\u00e9riaux\" a, dans la disposition de l'article 416, un sens diff\u00e9rent de son sens usuel, soit, suivant Larousse: \"Mati\u00e8res qui entrent dans la construction d'un b\u00e2timent, comme la pierre, le bois, la tuile, etc.\". que, de plus, le mot \"mat\u00e9riaux\" comprend les biens immeubles aussi bien que les meubles et que, dans le cas actuel, o\u00f9 l'on a joint deux maisons l'une \u00e0 l'autre, ces maisons sont des \"mat\u00e9riaux\", et que les dispositions de l'article 416 sont applicables \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce.\nAvec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne puis me rendre \u00e0 ces vues et me vois dans la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de rappeler que, non seulement les autorit\u00e9s ne supportent pas cette interpr\u00e9tation nouvelle du mot \"mat\u00e9riaux\", mais qu'elles \u00e9tablissent et affirment que depuis le jour o\u00f9 la loi romaine cr\u00e9a cette exception au droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, dont le principe est maintenu en l'article 554 du Code Napol\u00e9on et en notre article 416, jamais le mot n'a eu d'autre sens que son sens usuel, qu'il ne comprend pas les immeubles, mais seulement les meubles, et encore, seulement ces biens meubles se qualifiant comme mat\u00e9riaux.\nDes dispositions de l'article 416 font, comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, \u00e9chec au droit du propri\u00e9taire des mat\u00e9riaux puisqu'elles annulent, d\u00e8s leur incorporation au b\u00e2timent, son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et qu'elles l'emp\u00eachent de revendiquer ce qui lui appartient. Cette exception au droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 remonte \u00e0 une disposition de la Loi des Douze Tables dont le texte original et la traduction apparaissent au vol. 5, 143, des Pandectes Fran\u00e7aises (1804). Voici la disposition:\nSi le bois (tignum) d'autrui a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 et joint \u00e0 un autre \u00e9difice ou \u00e0 une vigne, qu'il n'en soit point s\u00e9par\u00e9 mais que celui qui l'a employ\u00e9 soit condamn\u00e9 au double: si le bois n'est encore que fa\u00e7onn\u00e9 ou lorsque l'\u00e9difice sera d\u00e9truit, que le propri\u00e9taire ait le droit de le revendiquer.\nEt on ajoute, au bas de la page 144:\nEnfin, les jurisconsultes Ulpien, Caius, et l'Empereur Justinien nous apprennent que, par la suite, on a compris sous le mot tignum (bois), tous les mat\u00e9riaux quelconques employ\u00e9s dans un \u00e9difice ou dans les vignes: non seulement les bois, mais aussi les pierres, les moellons, le ciment, la chaux et ce qui sert \u00e0 couvrir les maisons, comme la tuile, l'ardoise et autres mati\u00e8res.\nLe motif de cette exception au droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, tel qu'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la page 146,\nfut d'emp\u00eacher que les ruines des maisons abattues ne rendissent d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able l'aspect de la ville et que l'on ne troubl\u00e2t la culture de la vigne.\nChavot ( 1739). Trait\u00e9 de la Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Mobili\u00e8re. Tome 2, 263, N\u00b0 529:\nLes mat\u00e9riaux assembl\u00e9s pour construire un \u00e9difice sont meubles (art. 532) et ils restent meubles jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'ils aient \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s par l'ouvrier dans la construction. Mais alors, et d\u00e8s l'instant de leur union, les mat\u00e9riaux ne font plus qu'un seul et m\u00eame corps avec la construction, ils appartiennent au m\u00eame propri\u00e9taire, soit que la mati\u00e8re soit \u00e0 d'autres que le constructeur, soit qu'elle appartienne au constructeur lui-m\u00eame, mais que l'\u00e9difice ne lui appartienne pas en vertu de ce principe: Id quod solo inaedificatum est, solo cedit. Il importe peu, quant \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'\u00e9difice, qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 construit par le propri\u00e9taire du sol avec les mati\u00e8res d'autrui (art. 554), ou que le ma\u00eetre de la mati\u00e8re l'ait construit sur le sol d'autrui (art. 555) ; dans l'un et l'autre cas, il appartient au propri\u00e9taire du sol, sauf indemnit\u00e9s.\nIl ne s'agit pas ici d'exposer comment un immeuble (l'\u00e9difice) devient l'accessoire d'un autre immeuble (le sol), mais bien comment des objets meubles (les mat\u00e9riaux) deviennent l'accessoire d'un immeuble (l'\u00e9difice).\nA. Valette (1879) De la Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et de la Distinction des Biens, 148:\nOn y suppose que le propri\u00e9taire du terrain a fait entrer dans sa construction tignum alienum, mots qui s'entendent de toute esp\u00e8ce de mat\u00e9riaux appartenant \u00e0 autrui, qui ont pu servir \u00e0 b\u00e2tir: appellatione autem tigni omnis materia significatur, ex qua oedificia finit. En ce cas, d'apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8gles ordinaires du droit romain, le propri\u00e9taire des mat\u00e9riaux aurait d\u00fb pouvoir exercer une action dite ad exhibendum, pour faire d\u00e9tacher et repr\u00e9senter les mat\u00e9riaux englob\u00e9s dans le corps de l'\u00e9difice, et les revendiquer ensuite. Mais la Loi des Douze Tables avait interdit, en pareil cas, l'emploi de ces moyens juridiques, au moins \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du constructeur de bonne foi, et cela dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la conservation des \u00e9difices, ne oedificia rescindi necesse sit. \u0152uvres de Pothier, Bugnet, 3e \u00e9dition, tome 9, 161 :\nLa Loi des Douze Tables avait apport\u00e9 dans un cas une exception au droit qu'a celui \u00e0 qui appartient la chose unie \u00e0 la mienne d'en demander la s\u00e9paration; c'est dans le cas auquel j'aurais employ\u00e9 dans mon b\u00e2timent quelques mat\u00e9riaux qui ne m'appartenaient pas.................... Dans notre droit fran\u00e7ais, nous suivons cette d\u00e9cision de la Loi des Douze Tables, sauf la peine du double qui n'y est pas en usage. On se contente, dans notre droit de condamner celui qui a employ\u00e9 dans son b\u00e2timent des mat\u00e9riaux qui ne lui appartenaient pas, \u00e0 rendre \u00e0 celui \u00e0 qui ils appartenaient le prix qu'ils valent suivant l'estimation qui en doit \u00eatre faite par des experts.\nAnalyse Raisonn\u00e9e de la Discussion du Cod\u00e9 Civil (1822) 3e \u00e9dition, tome 2, 32. Jacques de Maleville, l'un des r\u00e9dacteurs du Code Civil Fran\u00e7ais, fait le commentaire suivant sur l'article 554 du Code Napol\u00e9on:\nJe crois que cette d\u00e9cision est juste en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et pour ce qu'on entend commun\u00e9ment par mat\u00e9riaux.\nToulier.

Il est tr\u00e8s simple: C'est qu'il n'y a plus d'objets mobiliers que le propri\u00e9taire puisse revendiquer. Ils sont devenus immeubles par incorporation. Ils n'existent done plus dans leur nature premi\u00e8re, tels qu'ils appartenaient \u00e0 leur ancien ma\u00eetre, ce qui exclut la revendication.\nA. Demante: Cours Analytique de Code Civil (1881) 2e \u00e9dition, 427, N\u00b0 390:\nMais \u00e0 quel moment les mat\u00e9riaux, arbres ou plantes, perdent-ils leur existence propre pour faire partie int\u00e9grante du sol ou de l'\u00e9difice? Pour les mat\u00e9riaux, il n'y a pas de difficult\u00e9, c'est du moment o\u00f9 ils sont employ\u00e9s dans la construction et bien entendu qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que l'\u00e9difice soit achev\u00e9.\nDe Molombe: Trait\u00e9 de la Distinction des Biens (1881) tome 1, 582, N\u00b0 664:\nL'expression mat\u00e9riaux n'est pas, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, moins vaste; pierre, bois, fer, sable tuiles, plantes, vignes, etc. Tout ce qui peut \u00eatre employ\u00e9, enfin, dans des ouvrages de ce genre y est compris. Et il importerait peu que les meubles d'autrui employ\u00e9s par le propri\u00e9taire du sol fussent pr\u00e9par\u00e9s et fa\u00e7onn\u00e9s; ils n'en seraient pas moins compris dans l'expression de mat\u00e9riaux et l'art. 554 serait applicable d\u00e8s qu'ils seraient une fois immobilis\u00e9s par leur incorporation avec le sol.\nPandectes Fran\u00e7aises, tome 1, Nouveau R\u00e9pertoire (1886) 319, N\u00b0 61:\nL'article 554 d\u00e9roge aux principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux en enlevant au propri\u00e9taire des mat\u00e9riaux la facult\u00e9 de les revendiquer. Cette disposition qui semble porter une atteinte s\u00e9rieuse au droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, se justifie cependant par l'incorporation des mat\u00e9riaux qui les a rendus immeubles et leur a enlev\u00e9 leur nature premi\u00e8re.\nN\u00b0 65:\nL'incorporation des mat\u00e9riaux au sol est n\u00e9cessaire car l'article 554 s'appuie pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, comme nous l'avons fait remarquer, sur le fait que ces mat\u00e9raiux ont chang\u00e9 de nature et n'existent plus dans leur ancienne individualit\u00e9. Il faut donc, pour d\u00e9terminer l'application de cet article 554, que ces mat\u00e9riaux soient devenus immeubles par nature et non pas qu'ils aient simplement rev\u00eatu le caract\u00e8re d'immeubles par destination.\nAubry et Rau: Cours de droit civil fran\u00e7ais (1935) 6e \u00e9dition, tome 2, 363:\nLa disposition de l'article 554 ne s'applique qu'aux objets mobiliers qui, par leur incorporation dans le sol ou dans un b\u00e2timent, sont devenus immeubles par nature, et non \u00e0 ceux qui ont simplement rev\u00eatu le caract\u00e8re d'immeubles par destination. Fizier-Herman : Code Civil Annot\u00e9 (1935) tome 1, 755:\nL'article 554 suppose que le propri\u00e9taire du sol n'\u00e9tait pas devenu propri\u00e9taire des mat\u00e9riaux par la simple possession en vertu de l'article 2279.\nCet article 2279 du Code Napol\u00e9on \u00e9tablit une pr\u00e9somption relativement aux meubles exclusivement et la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 cet article implique la reconnaissance du caract\u00e8re mobilier des mat\u00e9riaux.\nPlaniol et Ripert:\u2014Trait\u00e9 Pratique de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, (1926) 2e \u00e9dition, Tome 3, N\u00b0 264:\nLes questions qui vont \u00eatre examin\u00e9es par ces deux hypoth\u00e8ses supposent toutes qu'il y a eu incorporation mat\u00e9rielle, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il s'agit de mat\u00e9riaux de construction employ\u00e9s dans un b\u00e2timent et devenus immeubles par nature.

En traitant de l'acquisition de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par le rapprochement de deux choses, c'est sous le troisi\u00e8me sous-titre \"Rapprochement de meubles et d'immeubles\", que l'auteur traite de l'exception cr\u00e9\u00e9e par la Loi des Douze Tables.\nA tout cela, faut-il ajouter que, l\u00e9gif\u00e9rant sur la distinction des biens, le Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, reproduisant en cela l'article 532 du Code Napol\u00e9on,. \u00e9dicte \u00e0 l'article 386 que:\u2014\nLes mat\u00e9riaux provenant de la d\u00e9molition d'un \u00e9difice, ou d'un mur ou autre cl\u00f4ture, ceux assembl\u00e9s pour en construire de nouveaux, sont meubles tant qu'ils ne sont pas employ\u00e9s.\nJe crois que ces r\u00e9f\u00e9rences suffisent pour \u00e9tablir que le mot \"mat\u00e9riaux\", dans l'article 416, doit \u00eatre pris dans son sens usuel, qu'il ne comprend pas les immeubles, qu'il ne s'applique qu'aux meubles, et \u00e0 ces meubles se qualifiant, suivant le sens usuel, comme mat\u00e9riaux et que ce n'est que par le fait de l'incorporation au b\u00e2timent que ces mat\u00e9riaux perdent leur nature mobili\u00e8re pour acqu\u00e9rir alors celle du b\u00e2timent et devenir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire de ce dernier. Apr\u00e8s transport sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Dulac, ni la maison de Nadeau ni celle de Morin ne constituaient des mat\u00e9raiux et ceci est une raison plus que suffisante pour emp\u00eacher l'application des dispositions de l'article 416 \u00e0 cette cause. Mais il y a plus. En effet, et quant au b\u00e2timent de Nadeau,\u2014et on pourrait ajouter, celui de Morin\u2014, il s'agit clairement d'immeubles par nature suivant les dispositions de l'article 376 C.C. Sans doute, on peut bien, ainsi qu'on le fait remarquer dans Colin et Capitant, Cours \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, XIe \u00e9dition, tome 1, N\u00b0 922, ou dans les termes de Planiol et Ripert, Trait\u00e9 Pratique de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais (1926) Tome 3, 75, rappeler que \"les constructions volantes \u00e9tablies \u00e0 la surface du sol pour quelques jours et r\u00e9\u00e9difi\u00e9es ailleurs, de place en place, telles que les baraques de foire, ne sont pas des immeubles parce que ces \u00e9difices l\u00e9gers n'ont pas de place fixe\". Mais les deux auteurs reconnaissent, aux m\u00eames pages, le principe que \"pour qu'une construction soit immeuble, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'elle soit \u00e9lev\u00e9e \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9, que les b\u00e2timents construits pour une exposition sont immeubles quoiqu'ils soient destin\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9molis\". Ou encore, pour citer Langelier, Cours de Droit Civil, Tome 2, 115, doit-on reconna\u00eetre qu'en toute exactitude, \"la loi consid\u00e8re comme mobili\u00e8res, non pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment les choses qu'on peut transporter d'un lieu \u00e0 un autre, parce qu'on peut transporter des maisons, mais celles qui, dans l'usage ordinaire, sont destin\u00e9es \u00e0 changer de place\". Tel n'est pas, cependant, le cas du b\u00e2timent qui nous occupe. Ce b\u00e2timent \u00e9tait\u2014et personne ne le conteste\u2014un immeuble par nature lorsque, sans droit, on s'est appr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e0 le d\u00e9placer du sol de Nadeau. Immeuble par nature, lorsque reposant sur le sol de Nadeau, ce b\u00e2timent, apr\u00e8s d\u00e9placement, \u00e9tait encore assur\u00e9ment immeuble par nature lorsque reposant sur la fondation, \u00e0 ces fins pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par Dulac sur son sol. L'immeuble achet\u00e9 de Morin y fut transport\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment. Et dans la s\u00e9quence naturelle de tous les faits conduisant \u00e0 l'adjonction de ce b\u00e2timent \u00e0 celui de Morin, le fait de l'immobilisation physique et l'immobilisation juridique du b\u00e2timent de Nadeau au sol de Dulac, devait n\u00e9cessairement pr\u00e9c\u00e9der celui de son adjonction \u00e0 la maison de Morin. Cons\u00e9quemment et d\u00e8s lors\u2014\u00e0 tout le moins\u2014, faut-il admettre que c'\u00e9tait deux immeubles par nature qu'on proc\u00e9dait \u00e0 adjoindre et que cette immobilisation du b\u00e2timent de Nadeau \u00e9tait non seulement ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 son adjonction, mais existait ind\u00e9pendamment d'icelle. D\u00e9j\u00e0 en 1869, la Cour de Revision de Qu\u00e9bec (Chaloult v. B\u00e9gin) 20, d\u00e9cidait \"que, quoique le propri\u00e9taire de b\u00e2tisses ne soit pas celui du fond sur lequel elles sont assises, elles n'en conservent pas moins leur qualit\u00e9 d'immeubles tant qu'elles ne sont pas d\u00e9molies et qu'elles continuent \u00e0 \u00eatre assujetties aux hypoth\u00e8ques dont elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9es quand elles ne formaient avec le fond qu'une seule et m\u00eame propri\u00e9t\u00e9\". Et plus r\u00e9cemment, dans Laprise v. Morin 21, on r\u00e9it\u00e9rait que seule la d\u00e9molition d'un b\u00e2timent lui fait perdre sa qualit\u00e9 d'immeuble et que, si une maison hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9e est, \u00e0 l'insu et sans le consentement du cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire, enlev\u00e9e de son fond de terre et transport\u00e9e, sans \u00eatre d\u00e9molie, sur un autre immeuble, la vente judiciaire de ce dernier n'enlevait pas au cr\u00e9ancier le droit d'\u00eatre colloqu\u00e9 par pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour son capital et ses int\u00e9r\u00eats. Le consid\u00e9rant suivant de ce jugement re\u00e7oit, en l'esp\u00e8ce, une application :\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'un tel d\u00e9placement n'a pas eu pour effet de faire perdre \u00e0 cette maison son caract\u00e8re d'immeuble, ni \u00e0 l'opposant son droit d'hypoth\u00e8que sur cette maison.\net on r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision de Chaloult v. B\u00e9gin et \u00e0 celle de McAskill v. Richmond Industrial Co. 22, cette derni\u00e8re confirm\u00e9e en Revision.\nOn pourrait ajouter qu'il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9, de la part de l'appelant, aucune disposition l\u00e9gale ou autorit\u00e9 pouvant \u00e9tablir qu'en mati\u00e8re purement immobili\u00e8re, en un cas semblable \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce, l'adjonction, comme en mati\u00e8re purement mobili\u00e8re,\u2014suivant l'article 430\u2014, fait perdre, au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du propri\u00e9taire de la chose principale, le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire de la chose qui y a \u00e9t\u00e9 adjointe. Cet argument qu'on pr\u00e9tend tirer des dispositions de l'article 416, ne peut donc aider l'appelant. Les dispositions de l'article 416, les autorit\u00e9s ci-dessus l'\u00e9tablissent, font \u00e9chec au droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et, comme telles, sont des dispositions d'exception. Dans le motif inspirant cette exception, le L\u00e9gislateur pourrait trouver une justification d'en \u00e9tendre la port\u00e9e. Mais depuis le jour o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e, sous la loi romaine, ni sous cette loi, ni sous le droit fran\u00e7ais, ni sous le droit de Qu\u00e9bec, a-t-elle perdu son caract\u00e8re limitatif pour augmenter raccroc fait au droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il n'appartient pas aux tribunaux de faire ce que le L\u00e9gislateur n'a pas fait et, de toute \u00e9vidence, n'a pas voulu faire.\nReste la question de savoir si le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'avait l'intim\u00e9 sur ce b\u00e2timent pouvait, nonobstant son transport sur le sol de l'appelant, \u00eatre d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 par l'enregistrement de l'avis pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, enregistrement dont l'appelant, par son action, recherche la radiation. Dans Lower St. Lawrence v. L'Immeuble Landry Lt\u00e9e 23, cette Cour a reconnu que rien ne s'oppose \u00e0 ce qu'un privil\u00e8ge ou une hypoth\u00e8que n'affecte que la construction sans affecter le sol sur lequel elle est \u00e9difi\u00e9e, et a conclu \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de l'enregistrement du privil\u00e8ge du vendeur d'un r\u00e9seau de distribution \u00e9lectrique sur ce r\u00e9seau couvrant des emplacements dont l'acheteur du r\u00e9seau n'avait pas la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Cette d\u00e9cision supporte la validit\u00e9 de l'enregistrement de l'avis donn\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9 Nadeau pour publiquement d\u00e9noncer son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur ses b\u00e2tisses.\nQuant aux questions qu'on se pose sur les droits et recours futurs de Nadeau pour liquider cette affaire, il n'y a, sur le point, aucune difficult\u00e9. En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, cependant, il faut ajouter que ce sont l\u00e0 des questions \u00e9trang\u00e8res \u00e0 la disposition du pr\u00e9sent litige et, en outre du fait qu'il serait inopportun de le faire, il n'appartient pas aux tribunaux d'exprimer pr\u00e9matur\u00e9ment des opinions.\nIl reste un mot \u00e0 dire sur l'opportunit\u00e9 d'entendre Rodrigue avant de prononcer sur l'interpr\u00e9tation\u2014mais non sur l'annulation\u2014de la promesse de vente intervenue entre Nadeau et lui-m\u00eame. Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'apr\u00e8s avoir poursuivi Nadeau en la pr\u00e9sente cause pour faire radier l'enregistrement de l'avis donn\u00e9 par ce dernier pour d\u00e9noncer ses droits, Dulac a pris une action en garantie formelle contre Rodrigue, concluant \u00e0 ce qu'il soit tenu d'intervenir dans l'action principale, contester et faire rejeter les pr\u00e9tentions de Nadeau, et \u00e0 ce que Rodrigue soit condamn\u00e9 d'acquitter, indemniser Dulac de toute condamnation qui pourrait \u00eatre port\u00e9e contre lui en principal, int\u00e9r\u00eat et frais, etc. Cette action a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e personnellement \u00e0 Rodrigue. Il ne s'en est pas souci\u00e9. Il n'est pas intervenu. Il n'a m\u00eame pas comparu sur cette action.

In an action to cancel the release, set aside the agreement, and recover damages from the purchaser and the solicitor jointly.\nHeld: 1. In the light of the evidence since no relationship was established to make it the duty of the purchaser to take care of the vendors, a claim to set aside the release and recover payment failed. Tufton v. Sperni [1952] 2 T.L.R. 516 at 519.\n2. The trial judge rightly held that the solicitor neither by himself nor by connivance with the purchaser had imposed the bargain on the vendors. 3. The release was net an unconscionable, bargain in the sense in which the term is used in the cases but, if the Court had been able to arrive at the opposite conclusion, it would agree with the trial judge that the vendors could not secure any relief so long as they claimed they were entitled to set aside the original agreement.\nAppeal allowed and judgment at trial [1951-52] 4 W.W.R. (N.S.) 49, restored.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 1 allowing an appeal from the judgment of Montague J. 2 dismissing plaintiff's action against both defendants.\nW. P. Fillmore, Q.C. for the appellant Brock.\nR. D. Guy, Q.C. for the appellant Petty.\nL. St. G. Stubbs and H. P. Beahan for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKerwin J.:\u2014The respondents Louis Gronbach and his wife, Dinah Elizabeth Gronbach, signed the document of January 13, 1949, fully understanding its nature and effect, and there is no doubt that, at the time, the agreement was entirely satisfactory to them. It was said in the Court of Appeal that the agreement was impossible of performance by Mrs. Gronbach because she was not the owner of the stock in trade. An inventory was to be taken of it on the evening of January 31, 1949, and Petty was to pay for it in cash at wholesale prices. Accepting the position that Mrs. Gronbach alone was the \"vendor\" under the agreement, there would have been nothing to prevent the Court ordering specific performance thereof against her to the extent to which that was possible. She had agreed to the sale of the lands and premises, which would include any fixtures owned by her, for $35,000 and the money to be paid for the stock in trade was in addition to that sum. In our view the evidence discloses that Louis Gronbach, the owner of the stock in trade, had agreed to its sale, but, in any event, even if that be not so, the situation as between Mrs. Gronbach and Petty would not be affected. The agreement could, therefore have been performed by Mrs. Gronbach in the manner indicated. Leaving aside for the moment the question of The Dower Act, R.S.M. 1940, c. 55, there was therefore no reason why Mr. and Mrs. Gronbach and Petty could not agree to the cancellation of the agreement. The suggestion that this should be done came from the Gronbachs and, while the sum of $8,000 demanded by Petty for the release of January 21, 1949, is large, we cannot find that any relationship existed between Petty, on the one hand, and the Gronbachs, on the other, to make it the duty of the former to take care of the latter. As stated by Sir Raymond Evershed M.R. in Tufton v. Sperni 3: \"Extravagant liberality and immoderate folly do not of themselves provide a passport to equitable relief.\" Therefore, the claim to set aside the release and recover the $8,000 from Petty fails.\nThe trial judge has dealt satisfactorily in most respects with the position of the appellant Brock and we are of opinion that he came to the right conclusion that the solicitor, neither by himself nor by connivance with Petty, imposed on the Gronbachs the bargain demanded by Petty. We also agree that it has not been shown that the solicitor was negligent. For these reasons we must with respect express our disagreement with any of the strictures passed by the Court of Appeal upon the solicitor and, therefore, the decisions referred to in their reasons for judgment on that aspect of the matter are not applicable.\nUnder the circumstances as shown in the evidence, the release cannot be held to be an unconscionable bargain in the sense in which that term is used in the cases but, if we had been able to arrive at the opposite conclusion, we would, then agree with the trial judge that the Gronbachs cannot secure any relief when they persist in their attitude that they are entitled to set aside the original document of January 13, 1949. The Court has no jurisdiction to reopen the cancellation agreement and decree what ought to be paid by the Gronbachs to Petty.\nThe Dower Act was never referred to in the pleadings or at the trial and it was only after the hearing before the Court of Appeal that that Court requested argument upon the point. Mr. Fillmore pointed out that if it had been raised, evidence might have been led to show of what, if anything, the homestead consisted. The Manitoba Dower Act is not the same as the Alberta Statute considered recently by this Court in McColl-Frontenac Oil Co. Ltd. v. Hamilton 4, but even if the proper conclusion would be that the agreement of January 13, 1949, so far as any homestead of Mrs. Gronbach is concerned, was absolutely null and void for all purposes, and assuming that the point is open on the pleadings and should be dealt with by an Appellate Court, the money paid under the release of January 21, 1949, was paid under a mistake in law.\nThe option of January 21, 1949, (exhibit 7), was not binding on Mrs. Gronbach but no order need now be made as the two years from February 1, 1949, referred to in that document have already expired. We also agree that the agreement of January 13, 1949, was not binding upon the respondent Frederick Gronbach. The fact that no order as to costs was made by the trial judge sufficiently takes care of both these matters as the main dispute was as to the position of Louis and Dinah Elizabeth Gronbach under the agreement of January 13, 1949, and under the release. The appeals are allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and the judgment at the trial restored. The cross-appeal is dismissed without costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant, Petty: Fillmore, Riley & Watson.\nSolicitors for the appellant, Brock: Guy, Chappell, Wilson & Hall.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Stubbs, Stubbs & Stubbs.\n1 (1952) 5 W.W.R.

Under the scheme of arrangement subsequently adopted, the company was to pay the costs and expenses, including counsel fees, of the several committees; there was to be no remuneration to the members of the committees as such, but it was understood that if the fees allowed would reasonably permit it, counsel would make some allowance to the committees for the work they did. B assigned to the appellant the amount by which his taxed fees exceeded a specified amount.

H. Stikeman Q.C. and A. L. Bissonnette for the appellant.\nW. R. Jackett Q.C. and F. J. Cross for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice, Kellock, Locke and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKellock J.\u2014The facts found by the learned trial judge 2 are essentially as follows. The appellant was active with two others in the formation of a committee of shareholders of a company then in receivership, and became its chairman. Shareholders of other classes, as well as bondholders, had also formed other committees. The reorganization of the company was, at this time, being attempted through the instrumentality of a negotiating committee appointed by the provincial government, and, ultimately, a scheme of arrangement was agreed upon.\nThe appellant had nominated a Mr. Black to be counsel for the shareholders' committee of which he was chairman, and the former was duly appointed and acted in that capacity throughout.\nWhen the negotiation of the plan of reorganization was nearing its final stage, at a meeting of all the committees with the government committee, the appellant raised the question of remuneration for committee members. According to the evidence of Mr. Black, the chairman of the negotiating committee said that it had been understood throughout that there would be no remuneration for committee members \"as such\" but that counsel fees should be on a scale that the committees \"could get something\". After this meeting Mr. Black said to the appellant that while he did not like this arrangement, he was prepared to follow it out and see that, in that way, the appellant's committee did get something. Nothing was then said as to amount.\nThe scheme of arrangement provided that the company should pay the \"costs and expenses\" of the committees, but \"not including any remuneration to the members of the said committees as such\". It also provided that\nThe amount of the foregoing \u2026 costs and expenses in each case shall be as agreed upon by the Bondholders' Protective Committee and the person entitled thereto or, in default of such agreement, as may be determined by The Supreme Court of Ontario.\nIn a conversation between the solicitor for another shareholders' committee and Mr. Black, the subject of fees came up. The latter said he would be satisfied with $5,000 for himself, whereupon the other solicitor said that he would recommend that the bondholders' committee approve of $10,000, so as to provide $5,000 for the appellant's committee. According to Black, the appellant, on learning of this, was critical of Black for mentioning what the appellant regarded as a small amount, and Black was instructed to ask for $50,000. The bondholders' committee refused to go beyond $8,000, which would have left $3,000 only for the appellant's committee and this was not acceptable to the appellant. At the appellant's insistence, Black then prepared a bill of costs for $75,000 for the purposes of taxation under the scheme. The appellant attended with Black on the taxation, on which occasion Black explained that the bill was not only for legal fees but also remuneration for the committee. In view of the terms of the scheme, however, the taxing officer could not and did not allow anything beyond legal fees. The bill was taxed at $20,000 plus some small disbursements. The appellant, pleased with the result, told Black he was going to tell his committee that Black's fee should be $6,000 instead of $5,000, and this was done.\nSubsequently, it was arranged, with the approval of the department, that the amount taxed should be paid in three annual instalments, as the reorganization had occupied some three years. Upon the appellant stating to Black that he wanted his money assigned to him, Black assigned to the appellant the last two annual instalments amounting to $7,000 each. It is the first of these which is in question here. The appellant has taken the position that the amount was a gift to him and not taxable.\nThe appellant later demanded from Black $3,500 out of the $6,000 which Black had retained, claiming that Black had agreed to split his fees with him. This was refused, whereupon the appellant complained to the Law Society, stating that Black had agreed that everything over the $6,000 was to go to the appellant \"for the committee efforts\" and that, in addition, the legal fees were to be split. Black has taken the position throughout that the $6,000 was for himself exclusively and all that he was interested in, and that he had agreed to pay over to the appellant everything over and above that amount as remuneration for the committee.\nThe appellant made, various explanations below with respect to the $14,000, including a claim that it was a gift connected in some way with various mining claims which the appellant had and upon which he had spent, he says, some moneys. He proposed, he said, if they should turn out well, to transfer them to a company in which he and Black were or would be shareholders. All of these explanations were denied by Black and rejected by the learned trial judge.\nOn the facts as found by the learned trial judge 3 the inferences I think are plain. The appellant throughout his activity on the committee intended to be paid for his services if he could succeed in so doing. It has been already noted that the scheme of arrangement did not completely eliminate the possibility of the members of the committees being remunerated, but excludes direct payment to them for remuneration \"as such\". It was solely at the insistence of the appellant and for his benefit, that the taxation proceeded, and on the basis of the agreement between Black and the appellant that Black was to have no interest in any moneys beyond the $6,000 which he had agreed to take.\nThe appellant having succeeded in obtaining the remuneration he set out to obtain, and which he has kept for himself, I do not consider that the form by which that result was brought about is important nor that if there be any illegality attaching to the agreement to divide the taxed costs, this can avail the appellant. What the appellant received, he received as remuneration as he intended. Mr. Stikeman admits that had the offer of the bondholders to approve payment of $8,000 been accepted, the $3,000 which would thereby have found its way to the appellant would have been taxable in the hands of the latter as remuneration. In my view the mere interposition of the certificate of taxation does not change the character of that which the appellant actually received.\n\"Income\" is defined by section 3(1) of the statute to mean, inter alia,\n\u2026 the annual net profit or gain or gratuity, whether ascertained and capable of computation as being \u2026 salary \u2026\nSubsection (4) provides that\nAny payment made to any person in connection with any duty, office or employment \u2026 shall be salary of such person and taxable as income for the purposes of this Act.\nIn Herbert v. McQuade 4, the question for consideration arose under Schedule E., of the Income Tax Act, 1842, which imposed tax on \"the persons respectively having, using or exercising the offices or employments of profit\" in Schedule E for \"all . . . . . . profits whatsoever accruing by reason of such offices, (or) employments . . . . . .\". Collins M.R., at p. 649, referring to an earlier decision said that,\na payment may be liable to income tax although it is voluntary on the part of the persons who made it, and that the test is whether, from the standpoint of the person who receives it, it accrues to him in virtue of his office; if it does, it does not matter whether it was voluntary or whether it was compulsory on the part of the persons who paid it.\nIn my view this reasoning is equally applicable to payments made to a person \"in connection with\" an office or employment. In the case at bar it is perfectly clear that the payment in question was made in connection with the appellant's office as chairman and as remuneration therefor.\nIn Seymour v. Reed 5, Viscount Cave L.C., at 559, stated the principle to be that the language of Schedule E. rendered taxable\nall payments made to the holder of an office or employment as such, that is to say, by way of remuneration for his services, even though such payments may be voluntary, but that they do not include a mere gift or a present (such as a testimonial) which is made to him on personal grounds and not by way of payment for his services.\nIn Cowan v. Seymour 6, it was held that a sum paid to the secretary of a company who had acted as liquidator in the voluntary winding-up without remuneration was not taxable income, the amount in question having been paid to him by the shareholders after the winding-up as a tribute or testimonial and not as payment for services.\nIn my opinion these authorities make it plain on which side of the line the amount received by the appellant in the case at bar falls. This was not received by him as a testimonial nor as anything but remuneration for the services which he had performed. That the services had been completed when payment was made or that there was no assurance from the beginning that the services would be remunerated do not prevent the amount in question being taxable income. Lord Sterndale, M.R., in the case last cited, said at p. 508:\nIt seems to me that there may very well be a payment in respect of an office which has been gratuitous up to its end, which still may be a payment for the services of that office, and therefore a profit accruing by reason of the office. At page 511, Atkin L.J., as he then was, said:\nI agree also that it is not conclusive against a profit accruing to the holder by reason of his office that the office has terminated at the time he in fact received the alleged profit.\nAnd at 512:\nSo I should say the question here is whether if a sum of money is given to the secretary or liquidator substantially in respect of his services as secretary or liquidator, it accrues to him by reason of his office.\nI would be, in any event, of the opinion that the payment here in question, being paid and received as remuneration, also falls within the words \"the annual profit or gain from any other source\" in section 3, subsection (1), of the statute.\nIt is not without interest to observe that the appellant himself testified that prior to the formation of the committee, the matter of fees was one of the first things he discussed with Black. The appellant deposed that he then told Black that there was no assurance that anybody would get anything and that the latter had said that while there might not be anything for the committees, nevertheless, in organizations of that character \"they generally arranged for payment of the solicitor's fees or counsel fees and in big companies the fees are generally large\", and Black \"was willing to offer me to split his fee\" for the purpose of developing the mining claims to which I have already referred. Mr. Stikeman admits that under such arrangement, any moneys received by the appellant would be taxable.\nIt is true that Black denied this story and that the learned trial judge has accepted his evidence, but the significance of the evidence is that it demonstrates that from the outset the appellant intended to be paid for his services if he could succeed in so doing. In my opinion the means he ultimately took to secure that result do not, any the less, render the moneys he did receive, liable to taxation, although events did not actually take the course which, from this evidence of his, he had intended them to take.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs. Rand J.:\u2014The findings made by the President of the Exchequer Court 7 on conflicting evidence were not challenged before us. Their effect is that both the solicitor to the committee representing the 7 per cent preferred shareholders and its chairman, the appellant Goldman, as well as the chairmen of the reorganization committee and of the 6 per cent preferred shareholders' committee, understood that while no remuneration as such was to be paid to the members of the several committees by the company, the solicitors were to consider whether they could not, out of their agreed or taxed fees, make them some allowance. Goldman had argued strongly for direct remuneration, but without success.\nThe solicitor, at the meeting at which these matters were discussed, stated that he would be willing to accept $5,000 for his own services and to hand any excess over that amount allowed him to Goldman. The reorganization committee offered $8,000 but, on the objections of Goldman, it was declined. The fees were then taxed at approximately $20,000. Goldman thereupon agreed that the solicitor should retain an additional $1,000. The money was made payable in three annual instalments, the first of $6,000 to go to the solicitor and two of $7,000 to Goldman. The solicitor viewed the arrangement as equivalent to a recognition by him of a trust of all over $6,000 in favour of Goldman. Some time later, at the latter's insistence, he executed an assignment of the instalments which were, in due course, received.\nIn his income return for 1947, Goldman showed the first instalment of $7,000 as a gift from the solicitor with a note that the donor was to pay the gift tax. This was disallowed by the Department and the amount added to his income, the tax on which is the matter of this appeal.\nThat both parties intended the money to be paid and received as remuneration for services rendered by Goldman as committee chairman is not open to doubt. The solicitor became in fact a conduit between the company and Goldman. It was urged that the payment was voluntary. Apart from the question of a declared trust, it can be assumed that the solicitor was not legally bound to make the payment; but that he was bound by the common understanding, whatever it may be called or whatever its nature, is equally beyond doubt. He voluntarily undertook the obligation at least of his word given in an economic relation; but voluntariness of his consequent action is not to be confused with that present in gift.\nThe question is, therefore, whether the money so paid is within the provisions of the Income Tax Act. Sec. 3 provides:\u2014\n(1) \u2026 'Income' means the annual net profit or gain or gratuity, whether ascertained and capable of computation as being wages, salary, or other fixed amount, or unascertained as being fees or emoluments \u2026 directly or indirectly received by a person from any office or employment \u2026 and also the annual profit or gain from any other source including \u2026\nThe money was paid in respect of services performed in a business context; strictly speaking the 7 per cent preferred shareholders were the beneficiaries of and the persons for whom the work was done, even though indirectly the resulting arrangement was of the company's capital structure; is it necessary that the payment be made by the person for whom the services are rendered? The language of the section is,\nDirectly or indirectly received by a person from any office or employment;\nWhat is indirect if not something other than the normal direct course between employer and employee or its equivalent? I should say that the present case is a good example of indirect payment. Certainly, where the person paying is involved in relations that connect him with the object of the services, as here, it would be cutting down the language of sec. 3 unwarrantably to treat the payment as not within it.\nMr. Stikeman's basic objection was that we are not permitted to go behind objective facts and admit subjective understandings to give a payment its character. I find it a bit difficult to appreciate the force of that contention. To show that work has been done for or in the expectation of remuneration or that money is paid for certain work, necessarily involves the intention of the parties concerned; intention is material to the nature of acts in almost all relations; it is part of them, and certainly it is so in those here, whether of service or payment or receipt.\nIn Cowan v. Seymour 8, the Court of Appeal held that a sum voted by the individual shareholders of a company, after its liquidation, to the former secretary who had served without remuneration was, in the circumstances, a voluntary gift and not a sum that accrued to him \"in respect of an office or employment of profit\". It was argued there, as it has been here, that if the office does not carry profit there never can be income paid in respect of it. In the view of the Master of the Rolls, once a profit accrued to a person by virtue of an office, that fact itself made it an office of profit. In this aspect the difference in the language of the two statutes obviates the difficulty of that reasoning for the case here. Nor was the fact that the office was at an end conclusive; it is a circumstance of weight but not more. The Master of the Rolls adopted what was said by Lord Loreburn in Cooper v. Blakiston 9:\nIn my opinion, where a sum of money is given to an incumbent substantially in respect of his services as incumbent, it accrues to him by reason of his office.\nContrasted with such a payment is a benefaction of an exceptional kind such as a testimonial or other personal tribute, the antecedent instigation of which has been an office or employment. There the essential elements of gift are present; and though it may be related to the fact of services, it is not as remuneration for them that the gift is attributed.\nIn Herbert v. McQuade 10, it is said that the payment must be looked at from the standpoint of the person who receives it. While that aspect is no doubt relevant, the purpose of the donor or payer can be no less so. It is the latter's mind which determines that the payment be made at all and the object to which it is referred. That, at the same time, we should have, on the part of the receiver, an acceptance in the same understanding furnishes a complementary circumstance which would seem to me to put the matter beyond controversy.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Stikeman & Elliott.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

Two of his admissions were made verbally to friends of his and the third was contained in a statement to the police in his own handwriting and accepted by the Courts as having been given freely and voluntarily. The appellant did not give evidence before the jury and the theory of the defence was that although he had in fact made the statements they were untrue. His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. Two questions of law were submitted on appeal to this Court, namely, whether the jury had been adequately instructed as to the theory of the defence and whether they should have been warned as to the danger of convicting when the only evidence connecting the accused with the crime was his unsworn extra-judicial admissions.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting), that the appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Rinfret C.J., Rand, Kellock, Estey, Locke and Fauteux JJ.: There was no legal duty for the trial judge to warn the jury of the danger of convicting the appellant of murder even if, in their view, the only evidence to connect him with the crime consisted of his unsworn extrajudicial admissions.\nThere was in fact independent evidence tending to support the accused\u2019s admissions of having participated in the commission of the murder; the jury were adequately instructed as to the theory of the defence, namely, that the admissions were untrue, and of the numerous points which, in the appellant\u2019s submission, should have been brought to their attention, some were actually submitted to them by the trial judge and those which were not had either no foundation on the evidence or if they had, were denuded of any real significance in the test of the truthfulness of the material admission. The allotment of any substance to an argument or of any value to a grievance resting on the omission of the trial judge from mentioning such argument must be conditioned on the existence in the record of some evidence or matter apt to convey a sense of reality in the argument and in the grievance.\nPer Cartwright J. (dissenting): The authorities cited by the appellant do not formulate a rule of law that, in cases in which the only evidence to connect one accused of murder with the crime consists of his unsworn extra-judicial admissions, the trial judge must warn the jury that it is dangerous to convict.\nIt was however the duty of the trial judge to impress upon the jury the necessity of testing the truth of the admissions made by the accused by an examination of the other facts proved, and to call their attention to the circumstances mainly relied upon by the defence as tending to cast doubt upon the truth of the admissions, and this duty he failed to perform.\nAPPEAL from the oral judgment delivered by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the appellant\u2019s conviction for murder.\nA.E. Maloney for the appellant.\nW.B. Common Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice, Rand, Kellock, Estey, Locke and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nFAUTEUX J.\u2014On the 18th of September 1952, a jury of the Supreme Court of Ontario found that the appellant, \u201con or about the 9th day of December 1949, at the Township of Thorold, in the County of Welland, did unlawfully murder Sam Delibasich\u201d.\nAn appeal against this verdict was unanimously dismissed; the oral reasons delivered by the Chief Justice of the Province, at the conclusion of the argument, being:\u2014\nWe see no reason for disturbing the verdict of the jury in this case. We think that statements of the accused admitted in evidence were voluntary statements and properly admitted. We consider the charge of the learned trial judge to the jury was adequate. The appeal must be dismissed.\nThe appellant then obtained leave to appeal to this Court on two questions of law, namely:\u2014\n(a) Did the learned judge err in failing to instruct the jury adequately as to the theory of the defence?\n(b) Did the learned trial judge err in failing to instruct the jury as to the danger of convicting the accused of murder where the only evidence to connect him with the crime consists of his unsworn extra-judicial admissions? For a proper consideration of these questions, the main features of the case may, at first, be related.\nSam Delibasich, a taxi operator of the city of Welland, was last seen alive in that city at 6.30 p.m. on Friday, the 9th of December 1949. In the late afternoon of the following day, Saturday the 10th, his cab was observed in the west-end of the city of Toronto, in a parked position in front of a building, number 2111 Bloor Street West, by a resident of these premises, one Mrs. Bell who, a few days after, reported to the police the fact of its continued presence. A week later, on Saturday the 17th, the body of Delibasich was discovered, by a hunter, in the middle of a ploughed field off of the Hurricane East Road, at some 4 or 5 miles from the city of Welland. The Provincial Police were immediately alerted; a call went out for the cab which the Toronto police\u2014already apprised of its presence on Bloor Street\u2014towed into custody.\nFrom the investigation, particularly of the body, of the place and surroundings where it was found and of the cab itself, no clues connecting any one with the murder could be found. However, and as the evidence before the jury indicates, the following facts were then ascertained. The body of the victim was lying some 300 feet from the road, face down, with the arms extended and frozen stiff. The clothing was intact and mud-stained. No footprints and no indication of a scuffle were found in the field. The autopsy revealed on the front of the body depressions leading to the opinion that, while warm, it had lain on an irregular surface, the imprint of which was left during the freezing process. There were several wounds, the fatal ones having been inflicted on the head by a blunt instrument and six others\u2014three before and three after death\u2014caused by a rigid, round and pointed instrument. Death was attributed to fracture of the skull and injury of the brain.\nThe victim was known to usually carry on his person, in a wallet, substantial sums of money, but an amount of $13 only, mostly in silver, and loose in his pocket, was found. The operator\u2019s badge and operating permits usually attached to the sun-visor of the cab, and any other identification papers were missing. Whether there was in the cab any indication of a struggle or any blood is not shown in the evidence. This crime had remained unsolved for more than two years when the Crown acquired direct evidence, in the form of three self-incriminating declarations made by the appellant\u2014each of them at different times and to different persons\u2014on the strength of which the latter was prosecuted for murder. Two of these admissions were made verbally by the appellant to friends of his, the first, in September, 1951, to one Aubrey Leslie Merritt, whom he had known since childhood, and who, after long hesitation, i.e., in January, 1952, apprised the police of the same; the second, to Blanche Lucy Benner, of the city of Welland, with whom he had intimate relations and who reluctantly related these admissions to the police after his arrest. The third appears in a statement to the police made by the appellant in his own handwriting and accepted by the two Courts below as having been given freely and voluntarily.\nThe substance of the facts related by the appellant on these three occasions is:\u2014On the night of the disappearance of Sam Delibasich, the appellant and his brother Lloyd met at the Reeta Hotel in Welland where they consumed a small quantity of beer. They there and then agreed \u201cto make some quick money\u201d and to hire Delibasich\u2019s cab, drive out of town, \u201cknock him out\u201d and take his cab to Toronto to sell it.\u2014Incidentally, it may be noted that the appellant, his brother and their mother were also of the city of Welland, and knew the taxi operator very well.\u2014In furtherance of this plot, they called Delibasich, hired his cab and drove with him to St. Catharines when, nearing Port Robinson Road, they required him to stop. Their victim was then struck, at first with a hammer and then with an ice-pick, the latter instrument being used \u201cto finish him\u201d, according to what the appellant said to Merritt, or \u201cto make sure\u201d, according to what he wrote himself in his statement to the police. Having abandoned the body in a field, they proceeded to Toronto, stopping, en route, at Toronto Bay to throw into Lake Ontario the hammer, the ice-pick and some of the belongings of the victim. Attempts to sell the cab at used car lots in Toronto being vain, it was left on the street. They spent the night in the city and then returned to Welland.\nThe evidence also shows that a few days after having confessed to police officers, the appellant freely consented to accompany them to Toronto inorder to indicate, in the course of the journey, the various points having any bearing on the case. He thus pointed out the road leading to the field where the body had been found, the route followed to reach the point of the Bay from where he and his brother threw the hammer, the ice-pick, the operator\u2019s badge and the various papers of the victim into the lake. Though definitely unfamiliar with the city of Toronto, he also indicated one of the used car lots at which they vainly attempted to sell the cab and also the place where the latter had been abandoned on Bloor Street. The latter point was not more than 200 feet away from the place where the cab had, more than two years before, been observed by Mrs. Bell the day after the murder. The appellant was unable to locate, in the same district, the hotel where they were alleged by him to have registered under fictitious names, nor did the police subsequently succeed in doing so: it appears however from the evidence that hotel registration records were rather poorly kept if at all in the hotels of this particular district of the city.\nThis, in substance, was the evidence in the record at the close of the case for the prosecution.\nIn defence, the subject matter of the evidence adduced was limited to the character of the appellant. In this respect, the record shows the absence of any previous convictions, that his past conduct rendered unlikely his connection with the crime of murder and established the particular frankness of the appellant. Though testifying on the voir dire, in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the production of his statement to the police, the appellant did not however give any evidence before the jury, leaving thus unchallenged by him the fact and the truth of his various declarations. With the addition that nothing could be shown or found in the record which would indicate or suggest any reason or motive prompting the appellant to falsely charge himself and his own brother with the murder of a person they both very well knew, this summary relates the main features of the case.\nTurning now to the points of law raised in this appeal and dealing with the first one, i.e. whether the trial Judge erred in failing to instruct the jury adequately as to the theory of the defence. The defence did not deny the fact but only the truthfulness of the appellant\u2019s admissions. This was the theory of the defence at trial and the sole one suggested at the hearing before this Court. More than once it was stated to the jury by the trial Judge in his charge. It is contended however that this was not done adequately because the trial Judge failed to direct the attention of the jury to some 19 or 20 alleged arguments purported to be related to the theory of the defence. Whether all these arguments, which a subsequent and minute examination of the record suggested to counsel for the appellant, were actually formulated or even thought of before the jury by counsel then acting for the accused, could not be asserted to us and is very doubtful if one is to rely on the less numerous objections made at trial immediately after the address of the judge. Be that as it may and as to the merits of the contention itself, I must say that, after having carefully considered each of the points on which it rests, I fail, in the light of the particular features of this case, to see any real substance in it. In brief, some of these points were actually submitted to the jury by the trial Judge and those which were not are either without foundation on the evidence or, if they have, are denuded of any real significance in the test of the truthfulness of the material admission. This is all, I think, it is necessary to say on the matter except as to two of these twenty points, which themselves illustrate the nature of the others. Some comments may be found expedient in view of the importance given to them by counsel for the appellant.\nIt is suggested that the trial Judge should have commented on:\u2014\n(e) The failure of the police and the appellant to locate the hotel at which he and his brother were supposed to have registered and the inability of the police to find any such hotel notwithstanding their intensive efforts to do so.\n(h) The lack of any evidence of blood or signs of a struggle in the victim\u2019s taxi which serves strongly to contradict the appellant\u2019s statement to the police.\nOn (e):\u2014As already indicated, the evidence shows that registration records in hotels located in that particular district were very poorly if at all kept. Moreover, at least two years had elapsed since such registration was alleged to have been made and the moment that verification of the fact was attempted. Under such circumstances, I fail to see what real significance such evidence could have on the question of the truthfulness of the appellant\u2019s admissions.\nAs to (h):\u2014It was conceded that the presence or absence of blood in the cab was not even dealt with in the evidence nor was either the absence or presence of signs of a struggle in the victim\u2019s taxi.\nThe allotment of any substance to an argument or of any value to a grievance resting on the omission of the trial Judge from mentioning such argument must be conditioned on the existence in the record of some evidence or matter apt to convey a sense of reality in the argument and in the grievance. Had the autopsy, for instance, revealed poisoning instead of fracture of the skull as the cause of death, this undoubtedly would have, in this case, been a point of substance relevant to the theory of the defence. Far from conflicting with the appellant\u2019s admissions, independent proof of certain facts in the case tends to support his material admission, i.e. his participation in the commission of the murder. These facts are:\u2014The indication by the appellant of the place he and his brother abandoned the cab corresponding to the one at which it was found; the statement of the appellant that the ice-pick was used once the victim had been struck with the hammer \u201cto finish him\u201d or \u201cto make sure\u201d tallying with the opinion of the medicolegal expert that six wounds had been made by a rigid, round and pointed instrument, three before and three after death; the fact of the immediate disappearance of his brother from Welland after the murder; the fact that nothing can be found or was shown on the evidence in the nature of a reason or a motive moving the appellant to make false admissions charging himself and his own brother with the murder of a person they both knew very well.\nIn law, the general rule as again stated recently in Azoulay v. The Queen[1], is that the trial Judge in the course of his charge should review the substantial part of the evidence and give the jury the theory of the defence so that they may appreciate the value and effect of that evidence and how the law is to be applied to the facts as they find them. It is, of course, unnecessary that the jury\u2019s attention be directed to all of the evidence, and how far a trial Judge should go in discussing it must depend in each case upon the nature and character of the evidence in relation to the charge, the issues raised and the conduct of the trial. In the words of Goddard, L.C.J. in Derek Clayton-Wright[2]:\nThe duty of the Judge \u2026 is adequately and properly performed ... if he puts before the jury clearly and fairly the contentions on either side, omitting nothing from his charge, so far as the defence is concerned, of the real matters upon which the defence is based. He must give \u2026 a fair picture of the defence, but that does not mean to say that he is to paint in the details or to comment on every argument which has been used or to remind them of the whole of the evidence which has been given by experts or anyone else.\nThe rule is simple and implements the fundamental principle that an accused is entitled to a fair trial, to make a full answer and defence to the charge, and to these ends, the jury must be adequately instructed as to what his defence is by the trial Judge. Whether the rule has in any given case been complied with may at times be difficult to determine. In the present matter and for the reasons above given, I agree with the members of the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the charge was sufficient.\nThe second ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred \u201cin failing to instruct the jury as to the danger of convicting the accused of murder where the only evidence to connect him with the crime consists of his extra-judicial admissions.\u201d\nThis ground rests on the assumption of the fact that the record discloses a complete lack of independent evidence tending to support the truthfulness of the material admission made by the appellant. That such an assumption does not flow from a consideration of the evidence and of all the circumstances of this case I have endeavoured already to demonstrate. However, and on the basis of a different view being held in the matter, the question of law must be considered.\nThat the appellant could be legally convicted of murder by a jury solely on his extra-judicial admissions, i.e. without any corroborating evidence, is not disputed. What is suggested and what for the success of the appeal on this point must be accepted, is that there was in this case a legal duty for the trial judge to warn the jury of the danger of doing so. No authorities or precedents in point were quoted on behalf of the appellant, nor was it possible to find anyone to support this contention.\nThe only two cases to which our attention was directed did not state or recognize such a rule of law. The first one is Rex v. Sykes[3]. The question there considered by the Court of Appeal was \u201chow far the jury can rely on these confessions,\u201d i.e. the confessions made in that particular case. Nothing in what was then stated by Ridley J., on behalf of the Court, purported to be tantamount to a statement of a rule of law such as the one here contended for, but was indeed only an approval of the impeached instructions given to the jury by the Commissioner in that particular case. The question of warning was not dealt with. In the second case, Rex v. Rubletz[4], the ratio decidendi is that the trial judge, having determined that the confession made by the accused was free and voluntary, so instructed the jury, but in a manner confusing the two issues, i.e. the one related to the free and voluntary character of the confession and the other in respect to its veracity. On the latter point Turgeon C.J., speaking for the Court, stated at page 252:\u2014\nIf this confession was not free and voluntary, it would not be before the jury at all. Being there, it is the jury\u2019s duty to find whether or not it is true. This issue is different from the issue of admissibility which was before the Judge, and necessitates an inquiry going much further afield. Unfortunately, the instruction given to the jury on this all-important subject seems to me to have fallen short of what was required and to have tended to make the jury think that, if the statement was free and voluntary, it was true.\nNowhere in the case does the Court suggest that a warning should have been given to the jury. Reference may be made to what the Chief Justice said at page 251:\u2014\nIt does not follow, because a person comes forward freely and voluntarily and declares that he has committed a crime, declares, for instance, that another person supposed to have died a natural death, was in reality murdered by him, that his declaration must be accepted as true and that he must be convicted of murder. A jury may convict him: Rex v. Falkner & Bond 168 E.R. 908; R. v. Tippet 168 E.R. 923; but before doing so they ought to be instructed by the Judge in such a manner as to call their attention to all the circumstances surrounding the case and which may affect the truth or falsity of the confession. In my opinion, the learned trial judge in the present case having complied with the rule above considered in relation to the first ground of appeal, nothing more, on the matter, was required in his address to the jury.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts out of which this appeal arises are stated in the reasons of my brother Fauteux. I shall not repeat them but wish to mention the following additional details which appear to me to be of some importance. The witnesses, Merritt and Mrs. Benner, each of whom testified that the accused had confessed to taking part in killing Delibasich also testified that they did not believe his confession. After the accused had been arrested on a charge of murder his first statement to the police amounted to an assertion of his innocence. Shortly afterwards, following a question and an admonition, the accused, in the presence of the police officers, wrote out the confession which was admitted as Exhibit 8 at the trial.\nThe accused did not give evidence before the jury, but it is not, I think, open to question that both the fact of the three statements having been made and their truthfulness, if made, were put in issue by the plea of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d The theory of the defence was that although the accused had in fact made the statements they were untrue and he had had nothing to do with the killing of Delibasich.\nLeave was granted to appeal to this Court on the following points:\u2014\n(a) Did the learned trial judge err in failing to instruct the jury adequately as to the theory of the defence?\n(b) Did the learned trial judge err in failing to instruct the jury as to the danger of convicting the accused of murder where the only evidence to connect him with the crime consists of his unsworn extra-judicial admissions?\nAs to the second of these points counsel for the appellant relied on certain observations in the unanimous judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R. v. Walter Sykes[5]. In that case there was ample evidence, as in the case at bar, that a murder had been committed. The accused had made statements to two witnesses, one of whom was a police inspector, to the effect that he was the murderer. Later he had retracted these statements. The following passages in the judgment at pages 236 and 237 are relevant:\u2014\nIt would have been unsatisfactory to convict on the evidence had it not been assisted by the confession, and probably it would have been unsatisfactory if the conviction rested on the confessions only, without the circumstances which make it probable that the confessions were true.\nThe main point, however, is one independent of all these details, the question how far the jury could rely on these confessions. I think the Commissioner put it correctly; he said:\nA man may be convicted on his own confession alone; there is no law against it. The law is that if a man makes a free and voluntary confession which is direct and positive, and is properly proved, a jury may, if they think fit, convict him of any crime upon it. But seldom, if ever, the necessity arises, because confessions can always be tested and examined, first by the police, and then by you and us in Court, and the first question you ask when you are examining the confession of a man is, is there anything outside it to show that it was true? is it corroborated? are the statements made in it of fact so far as we can test them true? was the prisoner a man who had the opportunity of committing the murder? is his confession possible? is it consistent with other facts which have been ascertained and which have been, as in this case, proved before us?\nIt was said that the murder was the talk of the countryside, and it might well be that a man under the influence of insanity or a morbid desire for notoriety would accuse himself of such a crime. I agree that this is so, but it was a question for the jury, and they ought to see whether it was properly corroborated by facts, and so they were directed. We think that this part of the case was quite sufficiently left to the jury, and the Court thinks that there is no reason for giving leave to appeal.\nThis case was cited with approval by Turgeon C.J.S. giving the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. Rubletz[6], also relied upon by counsel for the appellant. The learned Chief Justice said in part:\u2014\nIt does not follow, because a person comes forward freely and voluntarily and declares that he has committed a crime, declares, for instance, that another person supposed to have died a natural death, was in reality murdered by him, that his declaration must be accepted as true and that he must be convicted of murder. A jury may convict him: R. v. Falkner & Bond, 168 E.R. 908; R. v. Tippet, 168 E.R. 923; but before doing so they ought to be instructed by the Judge in such a manner as to call their attention to all the circumstances surrounding the case and which may affect the truth or the falsity of the confession.\nThe learned judge decided that the statement was nevertheless a free and voluntary one, and I think he was right in so deciding. But a free and voluntary statement may, nevertheless, be false. Men have been known to accuse themselves falsely of the most heinous offences, fully conscious, sometimes, of the falsity of their avowal, and imagining at other times, that their souls were in fact charged with crime. If this confession was not free and voluntary, it would not be before the jury at all. Being there, it is the jury\u2019s duty to find whether or not it is true. This issue is different from the issue of admissibility which was before the judge, and necessitates an inquiry going much further afield.\nI do not read these judgments as formulating a rule of law that, in cases in which the only evidence to connect one accused of murder with the crime consists of his unsworn extra\u2011judicial admissions, the trial judge must warn the jury that it is dangerous to convict; but I think that they furnish a guide as to the way in which, in such cases, the judge should perform the duty which always rests upon him of laying the theory of the defence adequately and fairly before the jury.\nIn such cases, and especially when the accused has not given evidence, I think it incumbent upon the trial judge, (i) to impress upon the jury the necessity of testing the truthfulness of the admissions by an examination of the other facts and circumstances proved, and (ii) to call their attention, not necessarily to all the circumstances, but to those mainly relied upon by the defence as tending to cast doubt upon the truthfulness of the confession. In the case at bar I have reached the conclusion that neither of these duties was adequately performed.\nIn the argument before us and in his factum, counsel for the appellant referred to nineteen matters which, in his submission, might well cause the jury to doubt the truth of the confession, of which only two were specifically mentioned by the learned trial judge in his charge. I do not propose to examine each of the items in this list. Several of them appear to me to be unimportant but I wish to refer to three of them. (i) It is apparent from the evidence of Inspector Wood that the accused had told him that after abandoning Delibasich\u2019s taxi-cab in Toronto, he and his brother walked to a hotel at which they registered and spent the night of December 9, 1949; but a most careful and extensive search by the police had failed to locate any record of registration or other evidence to substantiate this. (ii) If the confession was true, the motive for the murder was robbery but some $13 was found on the person of the deceased. (iii) If the confession was true, it would seem probable that there would have been some bloodstains in the taxi-cab but there was no evidence as to whether any such stains were found by the police. None of these three matters was referred to by the learned trial judge in his charge. Counsel for the accused specifically requested that the attention of the jury be called to the item thirdly mentioned. I am respectfully of the opinion that they should have been put before the jury and further, since the theory of the defence was that the accused had fabricated the confession, the learned trial judge should have pointed out that there was no detail in the confession verified by any evidence extraneous to it which might not have come to the accused\u2019s knowledge through reading of the crime in the press. The learned trial judge in another connection mentioned to the jury that he remembered reading about the occurrence in the newspapers. No doubt, as in the Sykes case, \u201cthe murder was the talk of the countryside.\u201d I do not intend to suggest that had any or all of these matters been mentioned to the jury their verdict would necessarily, or probably, have been different, but I can not satisfy myself it might not have been.\nHow then did the learned trial judge present the theory of the defence to the jury? The following passages in the charge appear to me to be the only ones which deal with it:\u2014\nWhile I am on this subject, I want to say to you that that is the way you may interpret the evidence of the statement, this very important statement which has been put in and which was given by the accused. It will be before you in evidence. It is true that this is not sworn evidence but, gentlemen, it is evidence in the case. You may interpret that statement like any other evidence. You may believe all of it; you may think that statement is true. There may be parts that you may think are not true, or you may think as the defence asks you to, that it is not true at all.\n. . .\nBut in this case most of the evidence is direct. It is direct evidence of the accused himself if you believe it. He has signed a statement telling what happened. There is the evidence of two witnesses who say he told them what happened. That, gentlemen, is direct evidence, and it is a question of whether you believe it or not.\nGentlemen, in this case I have concluded that I do not need to charge you upon the question of manslaughter, and for this reason. I have not heard any evidence upon which a jury could find a verdict of manslaughter. Believe me, if there was any such evidence it would be my duty to draw it to your attention, and I would be most happy to do so, but I cannot on this evidence, on the evidence I have heard, find any evidence that would justiny a verdict of manslaughter. Indeed, and I ask Mr. Martin, who has so ably defended this young man, to see if I state it correctly, the whole theory of the defence is that this accused had nothing to do with this crime; that these stories were not true, and if that theory is accepted by you, or if you have an honest doubt whether that is the correct theory or not, the verdict will be a complete acquittal.\n. . . The theory of the defence, and you must consider it, gentlemen, because it is always important, is that that statement which was signed by the accused is not true at all; that having told the story once, he went right along with the thing. You must give consideration and thought as to that, gentlemen. But I suggest to you that you must also consider, and it is entirely for you to say, would a person sign a statement like that after being warned that he was charged with murder and was not required to say anything; would he do that if it were not true? You may think so. You are the judges of the facts, and it is entirely for you to say.\nWith the deepest respect for the learned trial judge, I find myself in agreement with the submission of counsel for the appellant that the theory of the defence was mentioned only to be brushed aside. Conceding that the theory was not a strong one, it was nonetheless necessary that it be adequately presented to the jury and for the reasons I have set out above I think this was not done.\nI would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a new trial.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the Appellant: Edmonds & Maloney.\nSolicitor for the Respondent: C.P.

The whole of the correspondence, interviews and conduct of the parties showed that they had not agreed upon the terms of a contract and that the respondent, up to the conclusion of the negotiations, was still trying to obtain terms more satisfactory to himself. APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division 1, affirming the judgment at trial and ordering specific performance of a contract to sell oil leases.\nJ. J. Robinette Q.C. for the appellant.\nG. H. Steer Q.C. and G. A. C. Steer for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nEstey, J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta 2, affirming a judgment after trial declaring a contract had been made between the respondent, as purchaser, and the appellant, as vendor, of eight oil leases the latter had obtained from the Government of the Province of Alberta, and directing specific performance thereof.\nThe appellant (def.) resides at Saginaw, Michigan, and the respondent (pl.) is a member of the firm of Perry & Buchta of Edmonton who \"specialize in putting deals together\" relative to oil leases and the production of oil. The correspondence commences by a letter of January 31, 1950, from that firm to appellant enclosing a list of royalties and also a few leases they had available at that time. Correspondence follows relative to these and on April 2 the appellant puts a postscript on his letter reading as follows:\nI have 8\u00bd sections between Wetaskiwin & Montrose, which I will take $20 an. acre for same or will sell \u00bd undivided interest in this piece, and I will pay half of drilling well. If you are interested let me hear from you.\nOn April 5 the firm wrote appellant intimating that they might arrange a drilling agreement with respect to his 8\u00bd sections and concluded the letter: \"We will do everything in our power to assist you.\"\nSome correspondence then passed between the parties, in which respondent's firm requested appellant's lowest cash price, as the firm had clients who might be interested. On April 26, 1950, appellant replied, in part:\nI will take\" \u00a732,000 cash in U.S. funds and 1\/8 of the gross oil. Well also must be started within sixty days from date deal is consummated. The learned trial judge stated:\nThe basis of the arrangement between the parties was contained in the letters of May 2nd and May 8th and, notwithstanding other previous and subsequent correspondence, the offer and acceptance as contained in those two letters was unequivocally accepted and confirmed by the plaintiff in the letter of August 24th from the plaintiff's solicitor to the defendant's solicitors in Saginaw, and further by the defendant then forwarding his leases to the plaintiff's solicitors. This, I think, disposes of the defendant's plea that there was no sufficient memoranda to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.\nMr. Justice Clinton Ford, on behalf of the learned judges in the Appellate Division, affirming the judgment at trial, stated:\nThe contract, as found by the trial judge, is contained in the letters of May 2nd, May 8th, May 15th and the 24th of August, 1950.\nThe letter of May 2 is written by respondent in the name of his firm and points out that appellant's terms, as submitted on April 26 (above quoted), are so high \"we cannot handle it at all,\" but then continues:\nHowever, you might consider the following and if you feel that you could accept these terms, I am sure we could put a deal over for you:\n$20,000 cash bonus, direct assignment of the lease to lessee, eighteen month drilling commitment if the well is not started within the terms of the drilling commitment, an additional bonus of $2 per acre will be paid to yourself, 2\u00bd per cent gross override to you, making a total gross override of 15 per cent, including the Crown 12\u00bd per cent or 1\/8. We feel it is utterly impossible to negotiate a deal on your lease with a 25 per cent gross override as suggested in your letter. It might be possible for us to get an additional consideration for you out of net production, however, this is an item that would have to be held in reservation.\nOn May 8 appellant wrote:\nI will accept your proposition of Twenty Thousand and No\/100 Dollars ($20,000) cash and 2\u00bd per cent Gross Over-riding Royalty. The $20,000 has to be in American funds.\nThe respondent, in his letter of May 2, submits terms upon which \"I am sure we can put a deal over for you.\" The appellant's reply of May 8, when read and construed in relation thereto, discloses that the terms are submitted as a basis for respondent's negotiating a deal. In fact respondent's letter of May 15 makes it clear that the terms were so regarded:\nWe will proceed immediately to try and consummate a deal for you at the earliest possible moment. There will, in all probability, be a counter proposal or two from our clients, and if such is the case, we will submit them to you at once. In the correspondence that follows respondent continues to write in the name of the firm, explaining delays but always hopeful of concluding an agreement.\nUp to about August 24 there does not appear to be any doubt but that the firm of Perry & Buchta were acting as agents on behalf of the appellant in an endeavour to effect a sale of the eight leases here in question.\nOn August 24 the respondent's solicitors enter into the correspondence and write the letter which the learned trial judge and their Lordships in the Appellate Division particularly refer to as constituting an acceptance of an offer made by the appellant. The material part of the solicitors' letter of August 24 reads as follows:\nRe: P. & N.G. Leases Nos. 76411 to 76418 both inclusive in Alberta.\nThis letter is written at the request of and under the instructions of Mr. A. G. Perry of this city, who advises that he is in a position to take these leases under the terms and conditions contained in his letter to you of the 2nd May last and your letter to his firm dated May 8, 1950.\nMr. Perry has asked us to prepare the Assignment and other necessary papers, but in order to do that it will be necessary that we have access to the above leases now in your possession.\nIf you will forward these leases to us we hereby give our undertaking to hold them under our control until we are in a position to remit to you the compensation you are entitled to receive.\nThis, with great respect, is not the language of an acceptance, but rather that of an agent informing his principal that he himself \"is in a position to take these leases under the terms and conditions contained in his letter to you of the 2nd May last and your letter to his firm dated May 8, 1950.\" That it was not intended to conclude a contract appears from respondent's solicitors' further letter of August 26, in which they state \"some discussion between you will be necessary before adequate instructions can be given to draw such an Agreement.\" On the same date, August 26, respondent indicates that he is not accepting an offer and thereby making a contract when he writes to the appellant, in part, as follows:\nMr. Howatt of Howatt and Howatt, my solicitor, is sending through a copy of the proposed agreement. However you and I will get together and complete the terms.\nWhile the letters of May 2 and 8 were intended as a basis for negotiations, as already stated, it is fair to conclude that a sale upon the terms thereof would have been agreeable to appellant. Even if, however, they be construed to be an offer, the letter of August 24 is not an acceptance because of both its own language and that of the letters of August 26, which discloses that the respondent was not accepting an offer, as he contemplated \"you and I will get together and complete the terms.\"\nThe respondent, however, contends that the appellant's conduct in forwarding the leases, as requested in the letter of August 24, discloses an intention on his part that the letter was an acceptance. It must be observed that these leases were sent in order that an assignment might be prepared as requested by the respondent. That such an assignment could only be and was intended by the respondent to be but a proposed assignment is clear upon a reading of the above quotations from the letter of August 24 and the two of August 26. There were then, as respondent himself stated, terms to be completed. In these circumstances the sending of the leases goes no further than to indicate a willingness that negotiations might continue, rather than, that an agreement had been concluded. The position is quite distinguishable from that in Canadian Dyers Association Limited v. Burton 3, cited on behalf of respondent. There the defendant-vendor contended no contract had been made. His solicitor, however, after the offer and acceptance had been made, sent a draft deed and said he would be ready to close on the first. It was held: \"His actions show that he regarded his letter as an offer and the letter of the 23rd as making a contract.\" The sending of the leases falls far short of any such conduct pointing specifically to the existence of a concluded contract.\nWith great respect to the learned judges who hold a contrary opinion, there does not appear to be here present either in the letter of August 24 or in the conduct of the appellant that absolute and unequivocal acceptance of terms required by the authorities to conclude a contract. McIntyre v. Hood 4; District of North Vancouver v. Tracy 5; Harvey v. Facey 6; Fulton Bros. v. Upper Canada Furniture Company 7. Moreover, when the whole of the correspondence and conversations are considered it is clear that the parties had not agreed upon the terms of a contract. However, negotiations continued. The \"get together\" contemplated by respondent's letter of August 26 (above quoted) took place at Saginaw on September 1. Respondent says that the parties hereto did there \"complete the terms\" of the contract and then went to the appellant's solicitor's office where they were detailed to him. It is common ground that these terms were not reduced to writing upon that date and, therefore, at that time there was no compliance with the requirements of the Statute of Frauds.\nInasmuch as the learned trial judge accepted the respondent's evidence \"where there is any conflict\" between his and that of the appellant, the foregoing, as to what took place at Saginaw, must be accepted, even though the appellant's evidence may be somewhat to the contrary.\nThe respondent deposes that just before leaving appellant at Saginaw \"I then said to Mr. Harvey, we had made a deal and we will rush it through as quickly as we can; and we shook hands on that deal right there and then in front of the hotel: and I went to my hotel room and immediately phoned Mr. Howatt's office.\" In that telephone conversation he gave instructions relative to the contents of the agreement. As a result, when he arrived at Edmonton and went straight to Mr. Howatt's office, the agreement which was enclosed in the letter of September 2 to appellant was in the course of preparation. The parties hereto had agreed at Saginaw that the assignment of leases, properly executed, would be deposited in the Royal Bank of Canada, Main Branch, Edmonton, and surrendered to respondent upon payment of $20,000 within a period of fifteen days. Notwithstanding that agreement, the proposed agreement, as prepared at Edmonton, signed by the respondent and enclosed with the letter of September 2, included no such provision. On the contrary, it provided:\nThe Assignee shall pay to the Assignor in cash the sum of Twenty Thousand American ($20,000) Dollars or its equivalent in Canadian dollars forthwith after the assignments of the said leases have been filed with and accepted by the Department of Mines and Minerals of the Province of Alberta.\nThe appellant's solicitors replied under date of September 7, acknowledging the \"purported agreement of sale\" and \"purported assignment\" and, after pointing out that he would require the drilling obligation and the overriding royalty to be set forth in both the agreement for sale and the assignment, continued:\nBe that as it may, the arrangement which we discussed with Mr. Perry during his recent visit to Saginaw was as follows:\n(a) Mr. Perry would engage you as his attorneys to prepare the assignment or assignments necessary to effect transfer of the leases from Mr. Harvey to Mr. Perry, or his nominee; and\n(b) Such assignments would be executed by Mr. Harvey, and thereupon forwarded to any Canadian bank designated by Mr. Perry, said bank to be authorized by Mr. Harvey to deliver said assignments to Mr. Perry, or his nominee, at any time within the period of fifteen (15) days upon payment to said bank as the agent for Mr. Harvey of the agreed consideration of Twenty Thousand ($20,000) Dollars in American currency or the equivalent thereof.\nThe procedure contemplated by your letter is considerably at variance with that discussed with Mr. Perry. We have no objection to the agreement of sale, but it and the assignments must all be escrowed and delivered together upon payment of the consideration, and each assignment should expressly reserve to Mr. Harvey the overriding royalty that has been agreed upon, although it will suffice if the drilling obligation is embodied solely in the agreement of sale.\nIf Mr. Perry is unwilling to consummate the transaction in the manner above outlined then we assume there is no cause for further negotiations, unless you can suggest a substituted procedure which will afford Mr. Harvey the same protection.\nIn the interim, the documents enclosed with your said letter dated the 2nd instant are herewith returned.\nOn September 9 respondent's solicitor replied, in part: \"We have your favour of the 7th instant and the terms are acceptable.\" He therein submitted a redraft of the consideration in the assignment with respect to which the letter stated: \"We trust this will meet with your approval.\"\nThe record does not suggest that the insertion of a provision as to the payment of $20,000 so completely different from that agreed upon at Saginaw was an error, but rather that respondent did so in order that he might obtain terms more satisfactory to himself. This view is supported, not only by his conduct throughout, but by his statement, when referring to the twenty-four-month drilling period, \"I never give up until the contract is signed.\"\nNotwithstanding the express admission in the letter of September 9 that the provision relative to the payment of the $20,000 ought to have been as stated in appellant's solicitors' letter of September 7, the respondent, under date of September 13, forwarded a second agreement executed by himself, in which he retained the provision relative to the $20,000 in identical terms to that enclosed in his letter of September 2.\nThis agreement enclosed in the letter of September 13 contained another important variation. Throughout, respondent had sought a twenty-four-month period for the commencement of drilling. Appellant had insisted upon eighteen and, in fact, as respondent deposes, they had agreed at Saginaw upon an eighteen-month period and a provision to that effect was included in the proposed agreement enclosed in the letter of September 2. Some time between the 4th and 7th of September respondent deposes that he had a long-distance telephone conversation with appellant, in the course of which he again urged that the period be extended to twenty-four months. Upon his own evidence, the appellant did not agree. Because, however, he did not again specifically refuse, respondent, with the hope that it would not be struck out, included a proviso to the effect that if the Department of Mines and Minerals of the Province of Alberta would consent and approve a postponement of six months for the commencement of drilling then the respondent would commence drilling operations within twenty-four months from the aforesaid date, that is from the date of the acceptance by the Department of Mines and Minerals of the assignment of the leases.\nNeither the appellant nor his solicitors made any further communication after the letter of September 7. The respondent's correspondence received thereafter remained unanswered. The position of the parties, therefore, remained as above described until about the middle of September, when appellant went to Edmonton and advised the respondent that he would himself undertake the drilling operations which, of course, concluded the negotiations.\nThe learned trial judge found a contract in the letters of May 2, May 8, May 15 and August 24, and the conduct of the appellant in immediately thereafter sending the leases. Portions of these letters have been quoted and already dealt with. In the formal judgment after trial it was stated:\n1. THIS COURT DOTH DECLARE that the agreement referred to in paragraph 3 of the Statement of Claim, as more particularly set out in the document entered as Exhibit 4 at the trial of this action, ought to be specifically performed and carried into execution and doth order and adjudge the same accordingly. The document described as Exhibit 4 in that judgment is that enclosed in the respondent's solicitors' letter dated September 2. That agreement, though executed by the respondent, did not embody the terms agreed upon at Saginaw. The appellant rejected it and the respondent himself expressly admitted by his solicitors' letter of September 9 that it did not express the terms agreed upon, in particular in relation to the $20,000.\nCounsel for the respondent contended that the words \"We have no objection to the agreement of sale,\" which appear in appellant's solicitors' letter of September 7, supported a view that the appellant was accepting the terms in the agreement enclosed in the letter of September 2. The letter of September 7 refers to the conversation at Saginaw, where respondent admits that only the assignment of the leases and the necessary documents, as required by law, were discussed. The preparation of such a proposed agreement as that contained in respondent's solicitors' letter of May 2 was in that letter mentioned for the first time. These words \"We have no objection to the agreement of sale,\" when read and construed in the light of the context and the surrounding circumstances, make it clear that all the appellant's solicitors were saying was that they did not object to the preparation of the written agreement rather than to the terms thereof. Indeed this is abundantly clear from the letter of September 7 itself in which they are taking exception to the terms relative to the paying of the $20,000. It would, therefore, appear that a conclusion favourable to the contention of the respondent cannot be drawn from this sentence.\nIn cases of this type the respondent (pl.) must establish a contract concluded between the parties and a note or memorandum sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. Hussey v. Home-Payne 8. The parties here negotiated, in part, at Saginaw, but mainly through correspondence. It is, therefore, essential to examine the evidence and the entire correspondence, both to ascertain whether the parties had agreed and, if so, whether there is a sufficient memorandum to meet the Statute of Frauds. The letter of September 2, the proposed agreement enclosed therewith and respondent's solicitors' letter of September 9, might support a conclusion that the parties had agreed, but, when read, as they must be, with respondent's solicitors' letter of September 13 and the proposed agreement enclosed therewith, it is clear that the respondent had not agreed. The minds of the parties had not met. There was no consensus ad idem because the respondent was still negotiating for better terms.\nThe position of the respondent is analogous to that of the plaintiff in Bristol, Cardiff and Swansea Aerated Bread Co. v. Maggs 9. There, after an agreement, as evidenced by two letters, had been arrived at, the vendor's (defendant's) solicitors submitted an agreement for approval and the purchaser's (plaintiff's) solicitors inserted a new clause which the vendor refused to agree to. Thereafter the purchaser sought to accept the original offer and to enforce the contract. Kay J. stated at p. 624:\nTheir position, therefore, is, that they were not satisfied with the terms of the two letters, but themselves reopened the matter by negotiating for another most important advantage; and having thus treated the two letters as part of an incomplete bargain, it would be most inequitable to allow them to say, \"Although we thus treated the matter as incomplete and a negotiation only, yet the Defendant had no right to do so, but was bound by a completed contract.\"\nIn my opinion, the decision of Hussey v. Home-Payne (supra) completely covers this case. I understand it to mean, that if two letters standing alone would be evidence of a sufficient contract, yet a negotiation for an important term of the purchase and sale carried on afterwards is enough to shew that the contract was not complete; and, so far as my own judgment is concerned, I entirely agree in the justice and equity of such a rule.\nRe Cowan and Boyd 10, is quite distinguishable. There the landlord, on March 24, offered to renew his tenant's lease at $75 per month. On March 31 the tenant replied, stating that he would renew at the former rent. On April 5 the landlord wrote that he would call upon the tenant between April 26 and May 1. This letter, written after the tenant's letter of March 31, the Court construed as leaving open the offer of March 24. On April 19 the tenant accepted the terms of $75 per month. In that case there was an unequivocal acceptance of an offer that remained open, whereas in the present case there never has been an unequivocal acceptance on the part of the respondent that could be enforced in law.\nThis case is distinguishable upon its facts from that of Perry v. Suffields, Limited 11. There the vendor was granted specific performance of a contract contained in two letters of February 23 and March 3, 1915. The defendant's solicitors sent a draft agreement in a letter in which they stated, in part: \"We do not know whether it incorporates quite all the terms agreed, as Mr. Perry has not seen it and we have not had very full instructions from him.\" The draft contract contained clauses at variance with that agreed upon and when it was contended that this amounted to a reopening of the arrangement between the parties Lord Cozens-Hardy dismissed that contention and stated at p. 193:\nThe solicitor frankly said he was not sure that he was fully instructed, and his attempt to alter the contract contained in those letters by making a new contract containing different terms as to price, as to fixing a date for completion, and as to the postponement of completion until after the completion of another contract for the purchase of a portion of the property by the Rugby Urban District Council seems to me to be entirely outside the question.\nThe letter of September 2 and the agreement enclosed therewith, signed by the respondent, were admittedly prepared upon his instructions. The position is, therefore, quite different from that in Perry v. Suffields, Limited, in that here the respondent is not submitting a proposed contract, with a request that errors and omissions be corrected, but rather does so for the purpose of obtaining terms more satisfactory from his point of view than those already agreed upon.\nThe correspondence and the conversations, when considered as a whole, do not establish a contract between the parties. The appeal should, therefore, be allowed and the action dismissed. On his counter-claim the appellant is entitled to an order (a) directing the respondent to forthwith deliver up to him copies of the leases here in question and referred to in the statement of claim; (b) directing the Registrar of the North Alberta Land Registration District to discharge the caveats filed by respondent against the titles to the lands here in question. The appellant is entitled to his costs throughout, both in respect to the action and the counter-claim.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the Appellant: Lindsay, Emery, Ford, Massie & Jamieson.\nSolicitors for the Respondent: Howatt & Howatt.\n1 [1952] 2 D.L.R. 148; 4 W.W.R.

Stewart, deceased, (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nJohn Dyck, William Duncan and James Duncan (Defendants) Respondents.\n1952: October 7, 8; 1953: March 18.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nDamages\u2014Fatal Accidents\u2014Basis of entitlement\u2014Reasonable expectation of deriving pecuniary benefits from deceased\u2019s remaining alive\u2014Remedy not barred because amount of loss incapable of precise ascertainment\u2014The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 132.\nIn an action before a judge and jury, two motorists were found liable under The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 132, for causing the death at the age of 55 years of a prosperous farmer and dairy operator. By consent of the parties the damages were assessed by the trial judge. The evidence was that at the date of death the deceased was in good health and that his life expectancy was 22.30 years and for the period of his life expectancy the present value of his annual savings was some $58,000, and of his average annual increase in net worth some $81,000. The deceased\u2019s will conferred substantial benefits out of the residue on the children hereinafter mentioned but the net estate, although substantial, was exhausted by specific devises and bequests so that they received nothing. The trial judge assessed the damages under the Act at $28,250 which he apportioned as follows: funeral expenses $250; to the widow $9,000; to a married daughter aged 30, $2,000; to two sons aged 28 and 22 respectively, $4,000 each, and to a third son aged 20, $6,000. The first two items were not questioned by the Court of Appeal but it varied the judgment at trial by reducing the damages awarded the youngest son to $2,000 and setting aside in toto the awards to the other children. Held: 1. To entitle a claimant to damages under The Fatal Accidents Act, it is sufficient if it is shown that the claimant had a reasonable expectation of deriving pecuniary advantage from the deceased\u2019s remaining alive which has been disappointed by his death. In the case at bar the chance of the claimants receiving benefits from their father\u2019s estate was not as a matter of law too remote to be regarded as a reasonable expectation. Pym v. Great Northern Ry. Co., 2 B. & S. 759; Goodwin v. Michigan Central Ry. Co., 29 O.L.R. 422, followed.\n2. The trial judge was right in deciding that the claimants had a reasonable expectation of receiving substantial benefits from their father\u2019s estate had he lived and should not be denied a remedy because the amount of their loss was incapable of precise ascertainment.\n3. There was nothing to indicate that the trial judge in fixing the amounts to be awarded the claimants had applied any wrong principle of law, or that the amounts he awarded were so inordinately high as to be wholly erroneous estimates of the damage, and they should therefore stand.

Harris, Q.C. for the appellants.\nJ.L.G. Keogh, Q.C. for the respondents, Duncan.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The late Harry W. Stewart, hereinafter referred to as the deceased, died on the 20th of December, 1949 as a result of injuries received on the 17th of December, 1949. This action was brought by his executors claiming damages under the provisions of The Trustee Act (R.S.O. 1950, c. 400) and of The Fatal Accidents Act (R.S.O. 1950, c. 132). The action was tried before Treleaven J. with a jury. It was agreed at the trial that all questions as to liability should be determined by the jury but that the damages should be assessed by the learned trial judge. All of the defendants have been found liable and such liability is not questioned on this appeal. The learned trial judge assessed the damages as follows:\nDamages under the provisions of The Trustee Act............................................................ $ 1,213.05\nDamages under the provisions of The Fatal Accidents Act............................................... 25,250.00\napportioned as follows:\u2014\nTo the plaintiffs for funeral expenses........................................................................................... 250.00\nTo Elizabeth Stewart, widow of the deceased........................................................................ 9,000.00\nTo Frank William Stewart, a son of the deceased.................................................................. 4,000.00\nTo Robert George Stewart, a son of the deceased................................................................ 4,000.00\nTo William Charles Stewart, a son of the deceased.............................................................. 6,000.00\nTo Margery Proctor, a daughter of the deceased................................................................... 2,000.00\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal the $1,213.05 damages under The Trustee Act, the $250 for funeral expenses and the $9,000 awarded to the widow were not interfered with but the judgment was varied by reducing the damages awarded to the son, William Charles Stewart, from $6,000 to $2,000 and setting aside in toto the awards to Frank William Stewart, Robert George Stewart and Margery Proctor. A cross-appeal, seeking to increase the damages, was dismissed.\nIn this court counsel for the appellants asks that the trial judgment be restored and does not ask any increase over the amounts awarded at the trial. Counsel for the respondents supports the judgment of the Court of Appeal and does not ask for any further reduction. In the result the questions which we have to determine are as to what damages, if any, should be allowed to Frank William Stewart, Robert George Stewart and Margery Proctor, not exceeding in any case the amounts awarded to them at trial, and whether the amount awarded to William Charles Stewart should be increased and, if so, to what amount not exceeding $6,000.\nThe facts relevant to these questions may be summarized as follows. At the time of his death the deceased was fifty-five years of age and his widow was the same age. They had one daughter and five sons whose ages at the date of the deceased\u2019s death were, Margery Proctor, thirty, Frank, twenty-eight, Fred, twenty-six, James, twenty-four, Robert, twenty-two, and William Charles, twenty.\nThe deceased was married in 1916 and at that time neither he nor his wife owned any property. The wife received about $4,000 from her father which was used in acquiring some of the assets which the deceased owned. It does not appear whether she received this $4,000 at the time of her marriage or later. Apart from this all the assets of the deceased were acquired by his own efforts with the assistance of his wife and children.\nNo detailed inventory of the assets owned by the deceased at the time of his death was put in evidence nor was there any detailed statement of his liabilities. Certain summarized statements were filed indicating that the gross assets of the estate amounted to $119,897.18 (including $2,510.07 life insurance) and that the liabilities totalled $60,329.36.\nThe assets included seven farms. A statement, Exhibit 11, indicates that the total value of six of these farms, which were specifically devised, was $72,700 and that they were subject to mortgages totalling $30,841.85. It is not clear whether these mortgages are included in the liabilities of $60,329.36, mentioned above.\nThe witness Proctor, who is one of the appellants and is a chartered accountant, explained that the values of all the assets which are given in the statements filed are those placed thereon by the officials of the Succession Duty Department and he expressed the opinion that if the assets were sold they might well realize fifty per cent more than these values. If this fifty per cent were applied only to the values stated for the six farms it would increase the value of the gross assets by $36,350 and indicate that in the thirty-three years between the date of his marriage and the date of his death the deceased had increased his fortune from the $4,000 contributed by the wife to a figure in the neighbourhood of $100,000.\nThe deceased left a will dated 6th December, 1949. By it he devised one farm to his widow, two farms to his son James, and three farms to his son Fred. The seventh farm, which is said to consist of eighty acres and as to the value of which there is no evidence, fell into the residue. The farms devised to James and Fred were charged with an annuity in favour of the widow and with paying off the mortgage on the farm devised to her. An automobile and all household goods and furniture were bequeathed to the wife, certain cattle to James, certain other cattle and all the deceased\u2019s interest in the \u201cAvondale Dairy\u201d to Fred. A legacy of one thousand dollars was bequeathed to an employee of the deceased. All the residue was left to James and Fred, charged with the payment of debts \u201cexcepting mortgages and debts owing with respect to the Dairy business\u201d, with the payment of $20,000 to Robert, $20,000 to Frank, $10,000 to Margery Proctor and $5,000 to William, such payments to be made over a period of five years from the date of the testator\u2019s death at the rate of twenty per cent each year, and with the payment of any succession duties payable in respect of these payments to Margery, Robert, Frank and William.\nIt was common ground that the residue is insufficient to pay the debts of the deceased, that the deficiency must be made up out of the assets specifically devised and bequeathed, and that consequently Margery, Frank, Robert and William receive nothing from their father\u2019s estate.\nThere is evidence that all of the sons had grown up at home and had worked with the deceased and that he had expressed the intention of giving all of them a start in life, that he was on excellent terms with all his children, and that Margery Proctor had lived at home until her marriage and had done the book-keeping and worked in the dairy, receiving only board, clothes and spending money.\nThere was evidence that the deceased was astute in business matters and had a specialized knowledge of cattle breeding.\nAn actuary testified that the life expectancy of the deceased was 22.30 years. He was in good health. Mr. Proctor testified that he had prepared the deceased\u2019s income tax returns for the years 1946 and 1949 inclusive and filed a statement showing for those four years, average annual net taxable income of $7,120.84, average annual savings from income of $3,786.26 and average annual increase in net worth resulting from savings plus capital profits of $5,250.76. There was evidence that the present value at the date of the deceased\u2019s death of the average annual savings for the period of his life expectancy was $58,459.85 and of the average annual increase in net worth was $81,071.73.\nWith the exception of William the children with whose claims we are concerned were not dependent upon the deceased. William was living at home and receiving spending money and money for his clothing from the deceased. As I understand the reasons of the Court of Appeal, the sum of $2,000 awarded to him by that court was to cover the pecuniary benefits which, in their opinion, it was reasonably probable William would have received from his father in the latter\u2019s lifetime. As has been mentioned this award is not now challenged. The argument of the appellants is that the additional $4,000 awarded to William and the sums awarded to Margery, Frank and Robert by the learned trial judge are reasonable, and indeed, conservative, estimates of the amounts which, but for his untimely death, they would in all reasonable probability have received from their father\u2019s estate.\nTo entitle a claimant to damages under The Fatal Accidents Act it is not essential that he should have been financially dependent upon the deceased or that the deceased should have been under any legal liability to provide for him or that he should have enjoyed any benefits from the deceased in his lifetime. It is sufficient if it is shewn that the claimant had a reasonable expectation of deriving pecuniary advantage from the deceased\u2019s remaining alive which has been disappointed by his death.\nIt is argued for the respondents that the chance of these claimants receiving benefit from their father\u2019s estate is as a matter of law too remote to be regarded as a reasonable expectation. I am unable to agree with this submission. I think that the contrary was decided in Pym v. Great Northern Ry. Co.[2] At page 768 Cockburn J., with the concurrence of Crompton, Blackburn and Mellor J.J. said:\nA fortiori, the loss of a pecuniary provision, which fails to be made owing to the premature death of a person by whom such provision would have been made had he lived, is clearly a pecuniary loss for which compensation may be claimed. It is true that it must always remain matter of uncertainty whether the deceased person would have applied the necessary portion of income in securing to his family the social and domestic advantages of which they are said to have been deprived by his death; still more, whether he would have laid by any and what portion of his income to make provision for them at his death. But, as it has been established by the cases decided upon this statute, that, if there be a reasonable expectation of pecuniary advantage, the extinction of such expectation by negligence occasioning the death of the party from whom it arose will sustain the action, it is for a jury to say, under all the circumstances, taking into account all the uncertainties and contingencies of the particular case, whether there was such a reasonable and well founded expectation of pecuniary benefit as can be estimated in money, and so become the subject of damages in such an action.\nIt is true that when this judgment was affirmed in the Exchequer Chamber[3], the passage just quoted was not expressly approved but nothing was said to indicate that it was wrong and, in my opinion, it correctly states the law.\nThe unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Goodwin v. Michigan Central Railway[4], is to the same effect. We have not been referred to any authority in which it has been dissented from and it should, I think, be followed. In coming to this conclusion I do not regard the decision of the Judicial Committee in Nance v. B.C. Electric Railway[5], as having decided the question as it appears from the report at page 614, that the case was argued on the assumption common to both parties that it was proper to award damages under this head.\nThere remains the question whether in the case at bar the evidence justified the finding of fact that the claimants had a reasonable expectation of pecuniary advantage from the continuance of their father\u2019s life to the extent of the amounts awarded by the learned trial judge.\nThe difference of opinion between the Court of Appeal and the learned trial judge does not appear to be as to the applicable rules of law but as to the effect of the evidence. I agree with the submission of counsel for the respondent that the findings of the learned trial judge do not depend on his view of the credibility of the witnesses. The primary facts are not in dispute. The learned trial judge was of the view that the proper inference to be drawn from these facts was that the claimants had a reasonable expectation of receiving substantial benefits from their father\u2019s estate, had he lived, while the Court of Appeal concluded that such facts indicated nothing more than a speculative possibility of such benefits.\nThe evidence of the statements made by the deceased and the terms of his will established that it was his desire and intention to benefit the claimants substantially upon his death. There was nothing to suggest that he was likely to change his mind in this regard. The record of his financial progress since his marriage, his average annual savings and average annual increase in net worth in recent years shewed, in my opinion, a reasonable probability that his fortune would increase with the years, with the corresponding probability that the claimants would, as he intended, receive benefits from his estate. His death has destroyed this probability. I think that the learned trial judge was right in deciding that the claimants had lost a reasonable expectation of substantial pecuniary benefit and that they should not be denied a remedy because the amount of their loss is incapable of precise ascertainment.\nIt remains to be considered whether the amounts fixed by the learned trial judge should stand. In my opinion they should. The Court of Appeal, being of opinion that no loss was established, did not discuss the quantum of damages. The principles by which I think we should be guided in approaching this question of quantum are laid down by the Judicial Committee in Nance v. B.C. Electric (supra) at pages 613 and 614 in the following words:\u2014\nTwo distinct questions arise: (1) What principles should be observed by an appellate court in deciding whether it is justified in disturbing the finding of the court of first instance as to the quantum of damages; more particularly when that finding is that of a jury, as in the present case.\n* * *\n(1) The principles which apply under this head are not in doubt. Whether the assessment of damages be by a judge or a jury, the appellate court is not justified in substituting a figure of its own for that awarded below simply because it would have awarded a different figure if it had tried the case at first instance. Even if the tribunal of first instance was a judge sitting alone, then, before the appellate court can properly intervene, it must be satisfied either that the judge, in assessing the damages, applied a wrong principle of law (as by taking into account some irrelevant factor or leaving out of account some relevant one); or, short of this, that the amount awarded is either so inordinately low or so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage (Flint v. Lovell[6]), approved by the House of Lords in Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated, Ld.[7]\nI find nothing in the reasons of the learned trial judge to indicate that he applied any wrong principle of law, and I find myself quite unable to say that the amounts which he has awarded to the claimants are so inordinately high that they must be wholly erroneous estimates of the damage.\nFor the above reasons I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge. The appellants should have their costs of the appeal to this court. The order of the Court of Appeal as to the costs of the appeal and cross-appeal to that court should stand.\nAppeal allowed with costs and judgment at trial restored.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Fleming, Harris, Kerwin & Barr.\nSolicitors for the respondents, Duncan: Bench, Keogh, Rogers & Grass.\n[1] [1952] O.R. 95.\n[2] (1862) 2 B. & S. 759.\n[3] 4 B. & S. 396.\n[4] (1913) 29 O.L.R. 422.\n[5] [1951] A.C. 601.\n[6] [1935] 1 K.B. 354.\n[7] [1942] A.C. 601.\n"}

Ashdown Hardware Company Limited (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1952: November 3, 4; 1953: March 30.\nPresent: Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey, Locke and Cartwright JJ.\nON APPEAL FEOM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nJudgments\u2014Merger\u2014Sale of goods\u2014Prior action against three partners\u2014Joint liability\u2014Default judgment against one\u2014Discontinuance as to other two\u2014New action against the two and another\u2014Order setting default judgment aside\u2014Whether merger\u2014Rule 113 of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nThe respondent had brought an action against the appellants and one Barker, former members of a partnership and whose liability was joint, for the price of goods sold and delivered. Judgment in default of defence was obtained against Barker and the action against the appellants discontinued. The respondent then commenced this action for the same debt against the appellants and another. After the joinder of issue but before the action had come to trial, the judgment in the first action against Barker was, upon his application, set aside. The appellants pleaded, inter alia, the recovery of the judgment against Barker and that the indebtedness had been merged in that judgment. The action was maintained by the trial judge and by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nHeld (Locke J. dissenting), that the appeal should be dismissed and the action maintained.\nPer Kerwin, Taschereau and Estey JJ.: Where a judgment has been set aside properly and without consent, as was done in the present case, there is an exception to the general rule that a judgment against one of several persons who are jointly liable on a contract effects a merger of the original cause of action.\nPer Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey and Cartwright JJ.: As long as the judgment was set aside before the adjudication, it matters not that it was done after the issue of the writ in the second action.\nPer Cartwright J.: The rule in King v. Hoare (1844) 13 M. & W. 494, does not apply when the judgment against one of several co-contractors who are jointly liable on the same contract has been, 'as in the present case, validly set aside. Having been set aside, the judgment against Barker ceased to operate as a bar to the action against the other co-contractors; it ceased to exist and therefore to have any effect thereafter, except possibly as a justification for an act done in reliance upon it during its existence. Semble, that the same result would obtain even where the order setting such judgment aside had been made on consent and no grounds had existed for setting it aside against the opposition of the plaintiff.\nPer Locke J. (dissenting): The rule at common law that a cause of action against several joint debtors is merged if judgment is taken against one of them whose liability is admitted has been altered in Alberta only to the extent provided by Rule 113 of the Supreme Court and upon the discontinuance of the action after judgment had been signed against Barker the cause of action was extinguished: King v. Hoare (1844) 13 M. & W. 494; Kendall v. Hamilton [1879] 4 A.C. 504; Odell v. Cormack (1887) 19 Q.B.D. 223; Hammond v. Schofield [1891] 1 Q.B. 453; Price v. Moulton (1851) 10 C.B. 561; Cross v. Matthews (1904) 91 L.T.R. 500, followed. Re Harper and Township of East Flamborough (1914) 32 O.L.R. 490 and Partington v. Hawthorne (1888) 52 J.P. 807, distinguished. While upon the evidence it should have been found that the judgment against Barker was set aside by consent, whether or not this was the case was not decisive, since Barker's liability for the debt for which judgment had been signed was expressly admitted and the cause of action having merged, could not be revived.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division 1, affirming the judgment of the trial judge. C. F. H. Carson Q.C. and A. L. Barron Q.C. for the appellants.\nH. W. Riley Q.C. and D. R. Fisher for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Taschereau and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.:\u2014The appellants Jack Singer and Abraham Belzberg are, together with William Kluner, the defendants in an action brought by the respondent to recover the price of goods alleged to have been sold and delivered by it to a partnership known as Atlas Plumbing and Heating which is said to consist of the defendants and one John Barker. So far as appears Kluner was never served with the writ of summons. The judgment at the trial in favour of the respondent against the appellants was affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta 2. In the Courts below it was alleged that the respondent had failed to prove that the goods had actually been sold and delivered but such contention was abandoned before us. I agree with the Appellate Division that the unsigned memorandum, Exhibit 2, was not a release or an estoppel. The only remaining question therefore is whether the respondent's claim was defeated under the circumstances now narrated.\nOn November 28, 1949, an earlier action had been commenced by the respondent against Barker and the appellants for the same sum of money and based on the same cause of action. On December 16, 1949, default judgment was entered against Barker only. On January 26, 1950, that action was discontinued as against the appellants and, on the same day, the present action was commenced. On February 23, 1950, judgment by default was entered against the appellants but on March 6, 1950, this was set aside. By their statement of defence, dated March 8, 1950, the appellants pleaded the default judgment against Barker in the former action and alleged that any indebtedness of the appellants was merged in that judgment. The joinder of issue and reply denied that there was any merger. Upon the application of Barker the default judgment against him in the previous action was set aside by an order of Mr. Justice Egbert on March 21, 1950. The trial of the present action did not take place until April, 1951. Even if it could be said that, in the absence of an allegation by the respondent that the previous judgment had been set aside, the trial judge should not have permitted to be produced the Court records, including the order of Egbert J., nevertheless he did so, and the Court of Appeal affirmed his ruling. The solicitors for the appellants were not taken by surprise as they had known for some time that the order had been made and, therefore, if the respondent had applied to set up in its pleadings the order of Egbert J. in order to show that the allegation of the appellants that there was an existing prior judgment against Barker was not correct, leave would undoubtedly have been given.\nIt is not the law, as was argued on behalf of the appellants that a judgment against one of several persons who are jointly liable on a contract effects a merger of the original cause of action which remains in force under all circumstances that may arise in the future. In Halsbury, 2nd ed. Vol. 13, 416, after referring to the principle that where there is but one cause of action the damages must be assessed once for all, it is stated:\u2014\n471. On this principle a judgment recovered (though unsatisfied) against some one of a number of persons who are jointly (not jointly and severally) liable on the same contract or are liable for the same tort with others, is, until set aside (d), a bar to an action.\nThe words \"until set aside\" are significant and in general the rule is subject to that condition. In principle I would think that must be so and it has been held that if such a judgment is properly set aside, it is as if it had never existed,\u2014Goodrich v. Bodurtha 3 referred to by Riddell J. in Re Harper and Township of East Flamborough 4, and Partington v. Hawthorne 5 cited in note (d) in Halsbury. We are not here concerned with the qualification contained in the note:\u2014\nbut a consent judgment regularly obtained, and not objectionable on the merits, cannot be set aside by consent of parties, so as to prejudice a third person in whose favour it is a bar (Hammond v. Schofield (1891) 1 Q.B. 453; 21 Digest 219; Cross & Co. v. Matthews and Wallace (1904) 91 L.T. 500; 21 Digest 223,575).\nbecause I agree with the Appellate Division, that it must be taken that the trial judge had decided that the order of Egbert J. had not been granted with the consent of the respondent, and that on the evidence this was a proper conclusion.\nThe judgment in Hammond v. Schofield 6 proceeded upon the fact that there a consent had been given by the plaintiff to set aside a default judgment but some expressions in the reasons of Wills J. were relied upon by the present appellants. At page 455, referring to the effect of the signing of a default judgment, he says:\u2014\nIf a judgment be improperly obtained, so that it never ought to have been signed, there can be no doubt when set aside it ought to be treated as never having existed. I am inclined to think (though it is not necessary to decide the question), that if it be regularly obtained, but through a slip on the part of the defendant, so that on an affidavit of merits it might be set aside, and it ultimately turns out that the defendant never was liable, it may equally be regarded as a judgment which never ought to have been signed, and would in such a case be properly treated as a nullity. If, being regularly obtained, though through a slip on the part of the defendant, and set aside upon an affidavit of merits, it ultimately turns out that the original defendant was liable, I do not think it could be treated, so far as the rights of other persons are concerned, as a nullity. Still less, when there is no pretence for saying that there is any ground for setting it aside upon the merits as' between the plaintiff and the defendant, and when as between them it could only be set aside by consent.\nAlthough not so expressed, the third sentence is in my opinion obiter but whether that be so or not, I am, with respect, unable to agree with it. In the first sentence, although stating it was unnecessary so to decide, Wills J. thought that if a judgment had been improperly obtained, if it is set aside, it ought to be treated as never having existed. However, if the effect of a merger be absolute, the original cause of action could never be resuscitated. In Parr v. Snell 7, Scrutton L.J. referred to what he has said in Moore v. Flanagan 8, where he adopted as correct what Vaughan Williams J. had stated in Hammond v. Schofield, at p. 457:\u2014\nThe basis of this defence (i.e. based on Rice v. Shute and Kendall v. Hamilton) is not the election or unconscious election, if there can be such a thing, of the plaintiff, but the right of the co-contractor when sued in a second action on the same contract to insist, though not a party to the first action, on the rule that there shall not be more than one judgment on one entire contract. If a judgment be set aside properly and without consent, as I hold to have occurred in the present case, there is an exception to the general rule which although binding by precedent was founded upon a fiction and should be restricted and not enlarged. The judgment having been set aside, there is not more than one judgment on one entire contract.\nIt was objected that the order of Egbert J. was made after the issue of the writ in the present action and that therefore the respondent had no cause of action at the date of the writ. Whether the default judgment against Barker be put forward as estoppel or merger cannot, I think, make any difference. The decision of the Appellate Division of Ontario in Cornish v. Boles 9, was cited on behalf of the appellants and it may be added that in that case there is a reference to Northern Electric and Manufacturing Co. Limited v. Cordova Mines Limited 10. Mr. Justice Riddell, who took part in both these decisions, subsequently decided the Harper case referred to above. I agree with the decision in Harper and in the Massachusetts case and conclude that the objection cannot be sustained.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nLocke J. (dissenting):\u2014On November 29, 1949, the respondent commenced an action in which the appellants and one Barker described in the Statement of Claim as \"carrying on business under the firm name of Atlas Plumbing and Heating\", and these three persons individually were named as defendants. The claim made was for the purchase price of goods sold and delivered to the alleged partnership. Barker was served with the Statement of Claim and on December 16, 1949, in default of defence, judgment was entered against him for the sum of $10,898.95, the amount claimed, and costs. Whether the appellants were served with the Statement of Claim in the action does not appear. On January 6, 1950, the respondent discontinued the said action as against the present appellants and on that date commenced the present action against the appellants and one William Kluner, the Statement of Claim alleging that during the years 1948 and 1949 the defendants had been partners with Barker in the business known as Atlas Plumbing and Heating, and claiming the same amount as in the first action for goods sold and delivered to such partnership. In the second action the defendants were served with the Statement of Claim and on March 8, 1950, filed a Statement of Defence in which it was alleged, inter alia, that the respondent had recovered judgment in the amount claimed against Barker in the first action, that, if there was a debt, the liability of the partners was joint and not joint and several and that the appellants had accordingly been released from any liability. On March 21, 1950, upon the application of Barker, Egbert J. made an order setting aside the judgment in the first action and gave Barker leave to defend.\nThe main question to be determined upon this appeal is as to whether the cause of action which the respondent asserted against the appellants and Barker in the first action was extinguished by the action of the respondent in signing a final judgment against Barker for the amount of its claim and thereafter discontinuing the action as against the other defendants.\nExcept to the extent that the matter is affected by Rule 113 of the Supreme Court of Alberta, it is the law that, where action is brought against one or more persons liable jointly for a liquidated amount upon a contract and final judgment is entered against one of them, the cause of action merges in the judgment and the liability of the others is extinguished. The rule in King v. Hoare 11, that a judgment even without satisfaction recovered against one of two joint debtors is a bar to an action against another, was expressly approved by the House of Lords in Kendall v. Hamilton 12.\nRule 113, while not in identical terms, appears to have been taken from the rule which is now Rule 3 of Order 27 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1883. In so far as it touches the present matter, the Alberta Rule reads:\u2014\nWhen a Statement of Claim includes a claim for a debt or liquidated demand with or without interest \u2026 and any defendant, fails to deliver a Statement of Defence \u2026 the plaintiff may as against such defendant enter final judgment for any sum in respect of which no defence is delivered \u2026 and may proceed with the action against any other defendants and in respect of any other claims. In the present matter the respondent might thus after signing judgment against Barker have proceeded in that action with its claim against the appellants but, for reasons which are not explained, elected to discontinue the action as against them and to start afresh, adding a third person as defendant. It is to be noted that when these proceedings were commenced the judgment against Barker in the first action had not been set aside and, as an additional argument to that upon the main point, the appellants contend that in any event the existence of this judgment was a bar to the proceedings as of the date they were instituted.\nIn King v. Hoare, Baron Parke, after saying that the question of substance to be decided was whether a judgment recovered against one of two joint contractors is a bar in an action against another, said (p. 504):\u2014\nIf there be a breach of contract, or wrong done, or any other cause of action by one against another, and judgment be recovered in a court of record, the judgment is a bar to the original cause of action, because it is thereby reduced to a certainty, and the object of the suit attained, so far as it can be at that stage; and it would be useless and vexatious to subject the defendant to another suit for the purpose of obtaining the same result. Hence the legal maxim, \"transit in rem judicatam,\"\u2014the cause of action is changed into matter of record, which is of a higher nature, and the inferior remedy is merged in the higher. This appears to be equally true where there is but one cause of action, whether it be against a single person or many. The judgment of a court of record changes the nature of that cause of action, and prevents its being the subject of another suit, and the cause of action, being single, cannot afterwards be divided into two.\nAnd later (p. 505):\u2014\nWe do not think that the case of a joint contract can, in this respect, be distinguished from a joint tort. There is but one cause of action in each case.\nIn Kendall v. Hamilton 13, the action was against one of three members of a partnership. A previous action had been brought and judgment recovered against two members of the firm and nothing was realized under the judgment. At the time the first action had been brought the plaintiff was unaware that the defendant in the second action had been a partner of the firm. The judgment was held to be a bar to the claim. Earl Cairns L.C. said in part (p. 515):\u2014\nIn the present case I think that when the appellants sued Wilson & McLay, and obtained judgment against them, they adopted a course which was clearly within their power, and to which Wilson & McLay could have made no opposition, and that, having taken this course, they exhausted their right of action, not necessarily by reason of any election between two courses open to them, which would imply that, in order to an election, the fact of both courses being open was known, but because the right of action which they pursued could not, after judgment obtained, co-exist with a right of action on the same facts against another person.\nThese remarks were made on the footing that Wilson and McLay, against whom judgment had been recovered, were the agents, and that Wilson, McLay and Hamilton, the partnership, was the undisclosed principal. The Lord Chancellor then proceeded to discuss the matter on the basis that Wilson, McLay and Hamilton were in the position of co-contractors and, considering King v. Hoare to have been correctly decided, was of the opinion that the recovery of the judgment against two of the three was fatal to the claim. Lord Selborne (p. 539) said that the judgment had the effect of extinguishing the legal liability of Hamilton as a partner on the debt previously due from the partnership of which he was a member. Lord Blackburn, who agreed with the other Law Lords that King v. Hoare had been rightly decided and that it did not depend on any such principle as that by suing some he had elected to take them as his debtors to the exclusion of those whom he had not joined in the action, said that the plaintiffs had a right of recourse against Hamilton for which they had never bargained and that they had destroyed that remedy by taking a judgment against persons who turned out to be insolvent.\nIn Odell v. Cormack 14, where a former member of a partnership was sued upon a bill of exchange accepted in her name without authority by one Carter who had been employed to realize the assets of the firm of which the defendant had been a member, judgment had been recovered in another action against Carter. Hawkins J., after finding that the action failed, since the defendant's acceptance had been given without her authority, said that this view rendered it unnecessary to discuss the effect of the judgment obtained. He then said that he was very strongly disposed to think that if a joint liability could have been established against Cormack and Carter, the fact that that action was abandoned against Cormack and judgment afterwards signed against Carter alone would have afforded her a good defence to the action on the authority of King v. Hoare and Kendall v. Hamilton, and that he did not think the effect of that judgment, so far as Cormack was interested, could have been altered to his prejudice by the plaintiff obtaining, with Carter's consent, a Master's order to set it aside.\nIn Hammond v. Schofield 15, the plaintiffs, a firm of printers, sued the defendant for the cost of printing for him a certain newspaper of which they supposed him to be the sole proprietor and the defendant consented to final judgment being signed against him. After judgment had been signed, the plaintiffs received information that at the time the work was done one T. was a partner of the defendant and joint proprietor with him of the newspaper. Accordingly, with the consent of the defendant, they applied for an order that the judgment should be set aside and the writ amended by adding T. as a defendant in the action. It was held that the consent of the defendant to the setting aside of the judgment could not enable the plaintiff to evade the rule that judgment recovered against one of two joint contractors is a bar to an action against the other, and that there was consequently no jurisdiction to make the order. The facts differ from those in the present case in an important particular since T. was not a party to the action at the time the judgment was signed against the defendant, and so the joint debt had merged in the judgment obtained before it was set aside. Wills J., speaking of the effect of the judgment, said (p. 455):\u2014\nThe effect of the judgment was undoubtedly to destroy the right of action against a co-contractor with the defendant\u2014King v. Hoare\u2014even though the plaintiff did not know when he signed judgment that he had a remedy against him.\nand again (p. 456):\u2014\nI cannot see upon what principle the consent of the plaintiff and defendant can be allowed to create a new right, or (which is the same thing), to resuscitate an extinguished right in favour of the plaintiff against a third person, or to create on the part of a third person a new liability.\nIn this matter no reasons for judgment were delivered by the learned trial judge. In delivering the judgment of the Appellate Division 16, Clinton J. Ford J.A. considered that since the judgment obtained against Barker had been set aside (though after this action had been commenced) it was not a bar to the action. He was further of the opinion that it should be presumed that the trial judge found that it was not set aside by the consent, either express or tacit, of the plaintiff and that a statement made in Vol. 13 of Halsbury, p. 416, was authority for the view that if the judgment were set aside otherwise than by consent any objection to the merger of the cause of action was overcome.\nIf the question were as to whether or not the judgment had been set aside with the tacit, if not the express, consent of the solicitor for the respondent, I would have difficulty in coming to the conclusion that by his conduct before Egbert J. he had not tacitly consented to the judgment being set aside. At the trial the respondent put in as part of its case the order setting aside the judgment which had been signed against Barker, but tendered no evidence as to how it had been obtained. The order setting aside the judgment and the court file in the matter disclose that there was no affidavit made by Barker explaining the reason why he had not defended the action or denying his liability to the plaintiff in the action, or explaining the delay of something more than three months in making the application to set the judgment aside. The appellants, however, at the trial called the solicitor who had appeared for Barker on the application who said that he had discussed with the solicitor for the respondent \"the project of opening up the judgment\" in advance of the making of the application and that, when the latter appeared before Mr. Justice Egbert and the judge had asked him what position he took towards the application, he had said that \"he was neither opposing nor consenting to the order\" or words to that effect. The solicitor acting for Barker said that he had mentioned to the judge that, in his opinion, there might be some question of contribution as between Barker and Belzberg and Singer but that he made no suggestion that his client did not owe the money. On being cross-examined he said that it was not a consent order and, in answer to a question: \"There is no doubt that it was granted on the merits?\", said that that was correct and that in making the application he was considering the welfare of Barker and that he had had no arrangements with the respondent or its solicitor. He, however, repeated that his client did not dispute liability on his part for the amount of the judgment. I have difficulty in understanding how any question of contribution as between these partners could have arisen since as the evidence showed Barker, Belzberg and Singer had on April 1, 1949, almost a year prior to the date of the application to Egbert J., entered into an agreement dissolving the partnership in which Barker convenanted, inter alia, to indemnify Belzberg, Singer and Kluner against all debts and liabilities of the partnership and all claims and demands in respect thereof. Furthermore, even had there been no outstanding covenant at the time, the signing of the judgment against Barker would not have affected any claim to contribution he might conceivably have had against his former partners. The solicitor for Barker expressed the view that this judgment was not set aside with the consent of the solicitor for the respondent, but this does not appear to me to be the proper conclusion from these facts. I think it is quite clear that the solicitor for the respondent who had charge of the proceedings in these two actions considered that it was in his client's interests that the judgment against Barker should be set aside and, while he did not expressly consent, it appears to me that by his conduct he tacitly consented to the making of such an order. That it had been regularly obtained and that the debt was due and owing is conceded and it cannot be seriously suggested that if the solicitor for the respondent had said that he opposed the application the Chamber Judge would not have refused it.\nThe passage from 13 Halsbury, p. 416, relied upon in the judgment of the Appellate Division, reads:\u2014\nOn this principle, a judgment recovered (though unsatisfied) against some one of a number of persons who are jointly (not jointly and severally) liable on the same contract, or are liable for the same tort, with others is, until set aside, a bar to an action.\nThis statement follows Article 470 in which the effect of the rule in King v. Hoare and other cases touching the same matter is discussed and which concludes with the sentence:\nThe principle is that where there is but one cause of action, the damages must be assessed once for all.\nI think this statement in Halsbury, if it is to be construed as meaning that, apart from the rule of Court, it is only until a judgment recovered against one of several joint debtors is set aside that it is a bar to an action against the others, is inaccurate. I am unable, with respect, to agree in the conclusion of Mr. Justice Clinton J. Ford that the judgment against Barker was not set aside by consent but, if I were, I do not think that that fact and the further fact that the judgment itself was signed in default of defence and was not a consent judgment are decisive of the matter.\nThis subject is discussed by Wills J. in Hammond v. Schofield at p. 455 where, speaking of the effect of the signing of a judgment in such cases, he said in part:\u2014\nIf a judgment be improperly obtained, so that it never ought to have been signed, there can be no doubt when set aside it ought to be treated as never having existed. I am inclined to think (though it is not necessary to decide the question), that if it be regularly obtained, but through a slip on the part of the defendant, so that on an affidavit of merits it might be set aside, and it ultimately turns out that the defendant never was liable, it may equally be regarded as a judgment which never ought to have been signed, and would in such a case be properly treated as a nullity. If, being regularly obtained, though through a slip on the part of the defendant, and set aside upon an affidavit of merits, it ultimately turns out that the original defendant was liable, I do not think it could be treated, so far as the rights of other persons are concerned, as a nullity. Still less, when there is no pretence for saying that there is any ground for setting it aside upon the merits as between the plaintiff and the defendant, and when as between them it could only be set aside by consent. I cannot see upon what principle the consent of the plaintiff and defendant can be allowed to create a new right, or (which is the same thing), to resuscitate an extinguished right in favour of the plaintiff against a third person, or to create on the part of a third person a new liability.\nIn the present case there is no pretence for saying that there was any ground for setting aside the judgment against Barker upon the merits.\nAn opinion apparently inconsistent with that of Wills J. was expressed by Riddell J. in Re Harper and Township of East Flamborough 17, upon an application by a ratepayer of the Township for an order quashing a by-law passed by the Municipal Council. Prior to the time when the proceedings were launched, the by-law had been approved by the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board and by a section of the Municipal Act it was provided that, after such approval, the validity of the by-law \"shall not thereafter be open to question in any court.\" After the motion had been launched the Board set aside its certificate of approval. It was objected that the by-law could not be quashed since at the time the motion was launched it was not \"open to question in any court.\" Riddell J. held that the objection failed and construed the section of the statute as meaning that the Court could not question the validity of the by-law which had been approved by the Court, if such approval was in existence when the Court was called upon to decide the point. He then said in part (p. 492):\u2014\nWere this a case of estoppel, difficult questions might arise: but, even then, there is respectable authority for the proposition that an action begun which can be met by a plea of estoppel, will lie if the estoppel be removed before the matter comes to adjudication.\nIn support of this statement Riddell J. referred to Goodrich v. Bodurtha 18, a decision of Thomas J. of the Supreme Judicial Court of that State. In that case the plaintiff brought his action upon a judgment recovered in the Court of Common Pleas upon a joint and several promissory note. While the action was pending, the judgment upon which it was based was reversed on the ground of want of jurisdiction in the Court. After the reversal the plaintiff obtained leave to amend his declaration in order to claim upon the original note and the defendant pleaded that the right of action had merged in the judgment. As to this claim, Thomas J. said (p. 324):\u2014\nTo this amended declaration the defendant answered the merger of the note in the judgment. To this the obvious reply was and is that, upon the reversal of the judgment, the merger ceased. It was as if no judgment had been rendered.\nWith respect, the learned judge might have said with greater force that since the judgment had been awarded by a court which was without jurisdiction it was itself a nullity and could not either effect a merger or have any other legal consequence. What was meant by the expression \"the merger ceased\" I do not understand. The statement, that upon the reversal of the judgment it was as if no judgment had been rendered, was directed to the judgment he was then considering and was not, I think, intended as having universal application. If it was, it was obiter and, I think, inaccurate. Riddell J., while noting that the judgment had been set aside by reason of lack of jurisdiction in the Goderich case, appears to have relied upon it as authority for the statement that when \"the obstruction by way of merger\" was removed and the judgment set aside there was no estoppel. It is to be noted that no question of merger affected the decision in Harper's case. There was no such question to be determined as the effect of the signing of a judgment upon further proceedings upon a cause of action, in respect of which it was awarded, and anything said by Mr. Justice Riddell on the subject of merger was simply obiter.\nSome support for the view that the signing of the judgment did not extinguish the cause of action and that it might be pursued, if the judgment is set aside, might appear to be found in the case of Partington v. Hawthorne 19. In that case the action was brought for goods sold and delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant at the Princess's Theatre. The order for the goods had been given by a person named Kelly, who the plaintiff afterwards discovered to be the agent of Hawthorne. The plaintiff brought an action against Kelly and recovered judgment in default of defence and thereafter sued Hawthorne. At the time the latter action was commenced, the judgment against Kelly was still in effect. Hawthorne applied to the Master and obtained unconditional leave to defend. On the plaintiff appealing from this order, Sir James Hannen, in Chambers, varied it by giving the defendant leave to defend only on paying the sum in dispute into Court. Hawthorne appealed from the latter order to a court consisting of Pollock B. and Manisty J. Two days before the appeal came on for hearing, the judgment against Kelly was set aside on an order of the Divisional Court, presumably on Kelly's application though the report does not say so. On the appeal, counsel for Hawthorne contended that since Partington had taken judgment against Kelly he could not proceed against Hawthorne for the same subject matter since the question was res judicata and that, having chosen to proceed first against the agent, he could not now proceed against the principal, referring in support of this contention, inter alia, to Kendall v. Hamilton. It was further contended that Hawthorne should at least have unconditional leave to defend. Baron Pollock said that the action against Kelly, in which the judgment had been obtained, was \"obviously a mistaken proceeding\" and should have been directed against Hawthorne. He said further:\u2014\nThat judgment, however, has been set aside. It is not now existing and there is nothing to show that the second action is frivolous or vexatious.\nManisty J. said in part:\u2014\nThe judgment therein obtained has gone and is as if it never had been. The matter is now just as if Miss Hawthorne had been sued originally; besides, she does not deny receipt of the goods.\nIt is unfortunate that the statement of facts in the report is so meagre. The case is not reported elsewhere, however. I think the decision does not touch the present question. Kelly, ordering the goods in the name and on behalf of Princess's Theatre, in which name apparently Hawthorne carried on business, was not liable to Partington for the purchase price. The judgment against him was set aside presumably on this ground. Taking the judgment against him did not merge the only cause of action that existed, which was as against Hawthorne for goods sold and delivered.\nI have been unable to find that the decision in Partington's case has been considered in any case in England. It was, however, explained and distinguished in a judgment of the Appellate Division of Ontario in Brennen v. Thompson 20, the judgment of the Court being written by Riddell J. In that case, the plaintiff sued three defendants T., L. and C. in the County Court for the price of goods sold and delivered. All three were sued as if liable in the same way. T. did not appear and judgment was entered against him upon default; the defendants L. and C. however, appeared and the plaintiff then delivered a statement of claim which, in substance, stated that T. had bought the goods as agent of L. and C, that the plaintiff had recovered judgment against T. and asked that if it should appear that L. and C. were liable as principals, the judgment taken by default should be set aside. On a motion by L. and C. to strike out the statement of claim and dismiss the action against them, the County Court Judge made an order setting aside the judgment which had been signed against T. and allowing the plaintiff to amend the statement of claim as it might be advised. L. and C. appealed and their appeal was heard by a Court consisting of Falcon-bridge, C.J.K.B., Riddell, Latchford and Kelly JJ. The judgment of the Court was that the case presented by the statement of claim was that the two defendants were undisclosed principals of the defendant against whom judgment had been signed by default and that that judgment was a bar to the prosecution of an action against the principals, the cause of action having passed into a judgment which could not be set aside without their consent.\nCounsel for the respondent on the appeal had relied upon the decision in Partington v. Hawthorne, apparently to support a contention that the judgment against T. having been set aside it was, as had been said by Manisty J., \"as if it never had been.\" Dealing with this contention, Riddell J. pointed out that in Partington's case Kelly, representing himself as acting for the Princess's Theatre, had ordered goods for the theater from the plaintiff and that they were sold, delivered to and debited against the Princess's Theatre. Further, they were sold on the credit of the theatre and Hawthorne did not deny receipt of them. As to the judgment which had been recovered against Kelly, he was of the opinion that it had been obtained necessarily on the hypothesis that Kelly had not the authority to act for Hawthorne. If, indeed, this was the ground upon which Partington proceeded against Kelly, the latter's liability would be in damages for breach of warranty of authority. Whether the action proceeded on this basis or on the ground that Kelly had contracted personally, though also on behalf of his principal, cannot be determined from the report. The statement in the judgment of Baron Pollock that the action against Kelly was obviously a mistaken proceeding can only mean that Kelly was not personally liable on either ground. Riddell J. pointed out that the cause of action against Hawthorne had accordingly not merged and, referring to his judgment in Re Harper and Township of East Flamborough, he said that once the judgment against Kelly was out of the way the action against Hawthorne could proceed. Mr. Justice Riddell's opinion as to the effect in law of the merger of a cause of action is made apparent by a further passage in his judgment dealing with a supposititious case where A. goes to C. and buys goods ostensibly for himself and on his own credit. C. thereafter discovering that B. is the real purchaser and A. only an agent for his undisclosed principal may sue A. and will succeed if he proves the sale only, or may sue B. when he will succeed if he proves agency. He then said (p. 471):\nIn either case the action is the same, for \"goods bargained and sold, and sold and delivered;\" there is only one cause of action, the one contract: a contract to which C. is one party and either B. or A. (at C.'s option) the other. If he takes judgment against either, the contract transit in rem judicatam and is merged, gone. He cannot thereafter say that the contract is in existence. Nor can he, having taken a judgment against one, revive against the other the dead contract; it stays dead.\nWhile expressing these views as to the consequences of the merger of a cause of action, the judgment of the Court in Brennen's case does not appear to have been based on this ground. Upon the evidence the Court were of the opinion that the agent and the principals were all personally liable, that there was but one cause of action and that signing the judgment against the agent was conclusive evidence of an election not to proceed against the others.\nIn the passage from the judgment of Riddell J. in Harper's case, above quoted, that learned judge said that if it was a case of estoppel there was respectable authority for the proposition that an action begun, which can be met by a plea of estoppel, will lie if the estoppel be removed before the matter comes to adjudication. However, as pointed out in the passage from Vol. 13 of Halsbury which has been relied upon in the present matter, the question in a case such as this is not that the plaintiff is estopped by having taken judgment against one of several joint debtors, but rather that the cause of action has been extinguished. While the judgment of the Appellate Division in Brennen's case, delivered by Riddell J. where all three defendants were liable, proceeded upon the ground that the plaintiffs had by taking judgment against the agent elected not to proceed against the others, the Court must have arrived at the same result, though on different grounds, had the liability of the three defendants been joint. If Riddell J. was of the opinion, when he delivered judgment in Harper's case, that where judgment had been taken against one of several who were alternatively liable or against one of several joint debtors, setting aside the judgment would revive the cause of action against the others, it would appear that he had changed his mind by the following year when he delivered the judgment of the Court in Brennen's case.\nPartington v. Hawthorne is the authority referred to in Note D to the passage from 13 Halsbury, above mentioned, for the statement that a judgment recovered against one of a number of persons jointly liable is until set aside a bar to an action. In that case, the defendant against whom the judgment had been signed had not been liable for the debt, the only cause of action being that against Hawthorne. The remarks of Baron Pollock and Manisty J. as to the effect of setting aside that judgment were presumably directed and accordingly must be limited in their application to the situation with which they were dealing. No question as to the effect of a merger of the cause of action could arise, either in that case or, as I have already pointed out, in the case of Harper or that of Goodrich. Partington's case was not one where there was joint liability and it does not support the proposition that where, as in the present case, judgment has been signed against one of several joint debtors, the setting aside of the judgment revives the cause of action as against third persons.\nThere is a statement in the 13th edition of Odgers on Pleadings, p. 207, where, dealing with the subject of estoppel by record, that is by judgment of a court of record, it is said that so long as a judgment stands no one who was a party to it can reopen that litigation, the matter having become res judicata. But this does not touch the question here. The appellants were not parties to the judgment which was signed. Estoppel is not a cause of action, rather is it a rule of evidence. In the case of estoppels arising from a judgment of a court of record, it is as between the parties and their privies that the record is conclusive so as to estop the parties from again litigating a fact once tried and found (Everest and Strode on Estoppel, 3rd Ed. p. 52). Odgers' statement, as is apparent from its terms, relates, and indeed could only relate, to the situation as between the parties to the judgment. In The Bellcairn 21, the question was as to the effect of a judgment entered between the owners of two vessels upon a subsequent dispute between them arising out of the same incident. The remarks of Lord Esher M.R., to which our attention has been drawn, amounted only to this, that if the first judgment was still in existence the matter as between the parties was res judicata. The case does not appear to me to bear upon the issue in the present matter.\nThe respondent's contention is, as I understand it, that where judgment has been signed against one of several defendants whose liability to the plaintiff is joint and the proceedings are thereafter abandoned against the others, the original cause of action which has been merged in the judgment may be revived and the legal consequences of having taken the judgment avoided by the simple expedient of obtaining an order of the court setting it aside, even though this be done without the knowledge or consent of the parties defendant who have been released of liability. If the mere setting aside of the judgment in this manner were effective to revive rights which have been lost as against those who were formerly joint debtors, I can see no sound reason why the same rule should not apply to rights which have been lost by election. By way of illustration, in Morel v. Westmorland 22, a claim was advanced against a husband and wife for necessaries supplied on the orders of the latter. The plaintiff, under the provisions of Order 14 of the Rules of the Supreme Court, obtained leave to sign judgment against the wife and proposed to proceed with the action against the husband. Holding that the liability of the husband and wife was alternative and not joint, and there being no rule permitting the plaintiff to proceed against the husband in these circumstances, the Court of Appeal decided that signing judgment against the wife was a conclusive election on the part of the plaintiff to hold her liable, to the exclusion of the liability of the husband (Collins M.R. p. 77). The judgment was upheld in the House of Lords, the Law Lords being unanimously of the opinion that the doctrine of election as stated in Scarf v. Jardine 23, applied. The legal consequence of the election was the release of the husband. If the respondent's contention in the present case be sound, then, notwithstanding such release, by obtaining an order setting aside the judgment entered against the wife, the liability of the husband would be revived. If there is any authority for any such proposition in English law, we have not been referred to it and I have been unable to discover any such.\nThere is but one cause of action against persons jointly liable in contract. Merger is effected by mere operation of law, independently of any intention of the parties that the inferior remedy should be discharged (Price v. Moulton 24. As pointed out by Baron Parke in King v. Hoare, the judgment of a court of record changes the nature of the cause of action which is the subject matter of the suit and prevents it being the subject of another suit. In Kendall v. Hamilton, Cairns L.C., speaking of the effect of the judgment taken against Wilson and McLay, said that the plaintiffs by doing so had exhausted their right of action. Lord Selborne and Lord Blackburn, as above stated, were in agreement that its effect was that the legal liability of the respondent was extinguished. In Hammond v. Schofield (p. 545), Wills J. said that the effect of the judgment was undoubtedly to destroy the right of action against a co-contractor with the defendant. The opinion expressed by Hawkins J. in Odell's case and that of Wills J. at p. 455 of the report of Hammond v. Schofield were no doubt obiter. The accuracy of the statement of the law by Wills J., however, appears to me to receive strong support from the judgment of Lord Alverstone C.J. in Cross v. Matthews 25, in which Kennedy J. concurred. Wills J. was the third member of the court hearing this appeal and his concurrence in the judgment of the Chief Justice shows that he remained of the same opinion as that which he had expressed thirteen years earlier. Other than general statements as to the effect of the setting aside of judgments in cases where the liability was neither joint nor alternative, I am unaware of any authority which suggests the contrary, other than the judgment in the present case. If the cause of action is extinguished by the taking of judgment against one of two joint debtors and the proceedings are regularly conducted and the debt justly due at the time the judgment is signed, I am quite unable to understand how the setting aside of the judgment, either by the consent of the parties to that judgment or otherwise, resuscitates the obligations of those who, by operation of law, were discharged when the judgment was signed.\nThe English counterpart of Rule 113 of the Supreme Court of Alberta first appeared in the Rules of the Supreme Court 1883, which came into operation in that year. I am unable to find that the exact point to be determined here has been decided in any reported English case. The rule in King v. Hoare was firmly embedded in the common law of England when the rule of court was first adopted. The principle of statutory construction to be applied appears to me to be accurately stated in Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, 9th Ed. p. 85, where the learned author, in dealing with the presumption against implicit alteration of the law, has said:\u2014\nOne of these presumptions is that the legislature does not intend to make any substantial alteration in the law beyond what it explicitly declares, either in express terms or by clear implication, or, in other words, beyond the immediate scope and object of the statute. In all general matters outside those limits the law remains undisturbed. It is in the last degree improbable that the Legislature would overthrow fundamental principles, infringe rights, or depart from the general system of law, without expressing its intention with irresistible clearness, and to give any such effect to general words, simply because they have a meaning that would lead thereto when used in either their widest, their usual, or their natural sense, would be to give them a meaning other than that which was actually intended. General words and phrases, therefore, however wide and comprehensive they may be in their literal sense, must, usually, be construed as being limited to the actual objects of the Act.\nThe rule was first enacted in England four years after the judgment of the House of Lords in Kendall v. Hamilton and it appears to me that its purpose is clear on the face of it. That purpose was to permit the plaintiff, in any action for a debt or liquidated demand where the act of signing judgment against one of several defendants might extinguish the right of action against others, to sign judgment against one or more and pursue the claim in that action against the other or others, a course which was not legally possible prior to the adoption of the rule of court. I think only to that extent was the common law rule changed. I think support for this view is to be found in the judgment of Lord Sterndale M.R. in Parr v. Snell 26. In that action, which was against three joint contractors for damages for breach of an agreement, the plaintiff obtained an interlocutory judgment for damages to be assessed against two of the defendants in default of defence. He then procured an assessment of damages and signed final judgment for the assessed amount against the two defendants who were in default and attempted to proceed against the remaining defendant. Rule 5 of Order 27 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1883 permitted a plaintiff in such an action, which was for pecuniary damages only, to enter an interlocutory judgment against a defendant in default but did not permit the signing of a final judgment, as was permitted by Rule 3 in the cases to which the latter rule applied. In holding that the plaintiff could not proceed further with the action, the Master of the Rolls said in part (p. 6):\u2014\nApart from any rules of Court or any statutory provisions to the contrary, it is quite clear that a judgment against one joint contractor or tortfeasor is a bar to proceeding against the others. It is not necessary to read the cases upon that point. It is clearly established in Kendall v. Hamilton; King v. Hoare; and Brinsmead v. Harrison with regard to both joint contractors and joint tortfeasors. Therefore, apart from any special provision by statute or rule, it seems to me quite clear that this judgment is a bar to proceeding against the other defendant. There are a certain number of rules contained in Order XXVII which have been framed to mitigate the hardship occasioned by the application of the doctrine in Kendall v. Hamilton; King v. Hoard; and Brinsmead v. Harrison, and unless the plaintiff can bring himself within one of these rules, the general doctrine must apply.\nThe rule, as originally enacted and as continued in Rule 113 of the Supreme Court of Alberta, does not say that the right of action does not merge upon signing judgment in respect of such a claim against one or more of the others; rather does it simply permit the action to be pursued after signing such a judgment. The true situation, therefore, in the present matter, when the judgment was signed against Barker, was, in my opinion, that the merger of the cause of action was conditional and not absolute, being subject to the right of the respondent to carry the proceedings to judgment against the present appellants in the action. That right the respondent appears to me to have abandoned when the action was discontinued against the appellants and it could not be enforced in a separate action. To hold otherwise would be to construe the rule as transforming a liability which was admittedly joint into one that was joint and several.\nI would allow this appeal with costs throughout.\nCartwright J.:\u2014The facts out of which this appeal arises are stated in the reasons of my brother Kerwin. Several defences were raised at the trial but I find it necessary to deal with only one of them, as, in my opinion, the others were rightly rejected in the courts below.\nThe defence to which I refer is that based on the default judgment signed against one Barker who had been a partner of the appellants. The facts so far as relevant to this defence are as follows. The appellants and Barker were indebted to the respondent for the price of goods sold and delivered. Their liability was joint, not joint and several. The respondent therefore had but one cause of action against Barker, Singer and Belzberg. On 28 November, 1949, the respondent commenced an action against Barker, Singer and Belzberg, based on the cause of action aforesaid, claiming $10,898.95. On 16 December 1949 judgment in default of defence was signed and entered for this amount against Barker. On 26 January 1950 the respondent filed a notice wholly discontinuing the action against Singer and Belzberg and on the same day commenced the action in which this appeal is brought. In the Statement of Claim in the present action the same amount is claimed as that for which judgment had been signed against Barker. On 8 March 1950 the appellants delivered their Statement of Defence pleading inter alia the recovery of the judgment against Barker and that the indebtedness was joint and was merged in such judgment. On 14 March 1950, the respondent delivered a reply which, insofar as it relates to the defence mentioned, reads as follows:\u2014\nIn reply to paragraph Nine (9) of the said Defendants' Statement of Defence the Plaintiff denies that the said debt was a joint debt, and not a joint and several debt. He further denies that the indebtedness was merged in the judgment recovered by the plaintiff against John Barker, and he further denies that the defendants were released from liability for such indebtedness. No further pleadings were delivered.\nOn 21 March 1950 Egbert J. sitting in Court made an order in the earlier action setting aside the judgment against Barker. This order recites that it was made upon the application of Barker and upon hearing counsel for him and for the respondent. It will be necessary to refer later to the \u2022evidence as to the circumstances in which this order was made. It appears that in August 1950 the solicitors for the respondent served upon the solicitors for the appellants a notice that at the trial of the action they would ask leave to amend their reply by pleading the order of Egbert J. which order was set out verbatim in the notice. The solicitors for the appellants thereupon wrote to the solicitors for the respondent stating that they would have no objection to leave being granted if this were applied for promptly but that they would object to its being granted at the trial. Their reason for taking this position was stated to be that they would require production and discovery in regard to the making of the order of Egbert J. The solicitors for the respondent did nothing further. At the opening of the trial counsel for the appellants referred to the notice of motion and asked the position of counsel for the respondent in regard to it. The latter said: \"When the trial is over you will perhaps know my position on that amendment. I doubt if it will become necessary.\" During the trial when counsel for the respondent sought to introduce the order of Egbert J. in evidence counsel for the appellants objected on the ground that it was not pleaded. The learned trial judge overruled the objection and permitted the order to be introduced. Following this counsel for the appellants called as a witness, Mr. McLaws, who\u201e had acted as counsel for Barker on the application to Egbert J. and examined him as to the circumstances under which the order of that learned judge was made. Towards the end of the trial counsel for the appellants again referred to the motion to amend and asked whether it had been abandoned and counsel for the respondent said to the Court:\u2014\"I never made any application my Lord.\"\nIn my view the position taken by counsel for the appellants was correct. I think that it was necessary for the respondent to plead the order of Egbert J. and that when it appeared that counsel had deliberately decided not to ask for the amendment to his pleadings he ought not to have been allowed to give evidence of the order. I think, however, that if the learned trial judge had so ruled counsel for the respondent would then have asked for leave to amend and that it would have been granted. I am unable to say that the appellants were prejudiced by what was, in my respectful opinion, an erroneous ruling and as such( ruling appears to me to have been in regard to a matter of procedure I do not think that we should interfere with the judgments below on this ground.\nFrom the above recital of facts it appears that when the present action was commenced in the Supreme Court of Alberta, and indeed when issue was joined, there was in existence a judgment of that Court against Barker for the same cause of action. Had the last mentioned judgment continued in existence I think it clear that, under the rule stated in King v. Hoare 27 and approved by the House of Lords in Kendall v. Hamilton 28, such judgment would (although unsatisfied) have been a bar to the plaintiff's claim against the appellants.\nIt is argued for the respondent that the rule does not apply in the case at bar for two reasons. The first is that the rule is abrogated, in the circumstances of this case, by the provisions of rule 113 of the Alberta Rules of Court, quoted in the reasons of my brother Locke. As to this, if the judgment against Barker had not been set aside I would have been of opinion that rule 113 did not assist the respondent. The effect of that rule is to modify the rule in King v. Hoare (supra) only to the extent of permitting a plaintiff who has sued, in one action, two or more persons who are jointly liable to proceed to judgment in that action against the other defendants notwithstanding that he has signed judgment against one or more of them in default of defence. I do not think that rule 113 assists a plaintiff who has taken judgment against one joint contractor and then seeks in a different action to obtain judgment against the co-contractors who were jointly liable with him. The reasons of Byrne J. in McLeod v. Power 29 and those of the Court of Appeal in Parr v. Snell 30 indicate that a rule of this nature is to be strictly construed. The second and main reason urged by the respondent is that the setting aside of the judgment against Barker prevents the application of the rule in King v. Hoare. As to this if the matter were devoid of authority I would have thought that upon the judgment against one of several co-contractors being set aside it would cease to operate as a bar to an action against the others, that upon being set aside it ceases to exist and therefore to have any effect thereafter, although it would in some circumstances provide a justification for an act done in reliance upon it between the time of its being given and being set aside, as for example in the case of Williams v. Smith 31. This view of the matter finds some support in the way in which the rule is stated, and particularly in the words which I have italicized, in the following passages: Halsbury 2nd Edition, Vol. 13, page 416:\u2014\nOn this principle, a judgment recovered (though unsatisfied) against some one of a number of persons who are jointly (not jointly and severally) liable on the same contract, or are liable for the same tort, with others is, until set aside, a bar to an action against the others (although the plaintiff may not have been aware of their liability), not on any ground of estoppel, but because there was but one cause of action, and that has merged in the judgment\u2014transit in rem judicatam; and because in the case of contract the others are deprived by the act of the plaintiff of the right to have their liability determined in the same judgment with their co-contractors.\nOdgers on Pleading, 3rd Edition, page 207:\u2014\nEstoppel by record, e.g., by a judgment of a Court of Record. The matter becomes res judicata. So long as that judgment stands, no one who was a party to it can re-open that litigation.\nReference may also be made to the words of Lord Mansfield in Moses v. Macferlan 32:\nIt is most clear, \"that the merits of a judgment can never be over-haled by an original suit, either at law or in equity.\" Till the judgment is set aside, or reversed, it is conclusive, as to the subject matter of it, to all intents and purposes.\nIt is, however, argued for the appellants that it has been held in cases which we ought to follow that once a judgment has been entered against one of several co-contractors the right of action against the others is irrevocably lost and that the setting aside of such judgment (except, perhaps in cases where it was irregularly entered or for some other reason ought never to have been pronounced) is immaterial. The cases relied on in support of this proposition are Hammond v. Schofield 33, Odell v. Cormack 34, The Bellcairn 35, Cross and Co. v. Matthews and Wallace 36, M. Brennen and Sons v. Thompson 37; and it is necessary to examine each of them.\nHammond v. Schofield is distinguishable on the facts. In that case the plaintiffs, a firm of printers, sued the defendant for the cost of printing a newspaper of which they supposed him to be the sole proprietor. There being no defence the defendant consented to final judgment being signed against him. After judgment had been so signed the plaintiffs received information that at the time the work was done one Thomas was a partner of the defendant and jointly liable with him. With the consent of the defendant they obtained an order in the Birmingham District Registry ordering that the default judgment be set aside and that the writ be amended by adding Thomas as a defendant in the action. That order was confirmed on appeal by Pollock, B. Thomas appealed to the Divisional Court consisting of Wills and Vaughan Williams, JJ. and the appeal was allowed. From the above summary of the facts it is clear that in the final result the default judgment was not set aside as the order setting it aside was reversed by the Divisional Court. In the case at bar, on the other hand, the default judgment against Barker had been set aside by the order of Egbert J. and no appeal has been taken from that order. It would appear that under rule 446 of the Alberta Rules of Court, the appellants, upon the order of Egbert J. coming to their notice, might have moved to rescind it but they did not do this. Egbert J. clearly had jurisdiction to make it under the provisions of rule 127 of the Alberta Rules of Court. If it is contended that an order made by a judge of the Supreme Court of Alberta, who clearly had jurisdiction to make it, setting aside a default judgment entered in that Court ought not to have been made the proper course would seem to be to attack such order directly either by way of appeal or by motion to rescind. The Court cannot, in another action, simply ignore it or treat it as being ineffective. It appears to me that anything said in the judgments in Hammond v. Schofield as to what would be the effect on the liability of persons jointly liable with one against whom judgment had been taken of that judgment having been validly set aside is obiter. Wills J. relied on Odell v. Cormack (supra) and The Bellcairn (supra).\nIn Odell v. Cormack at page 228 Hawkins J. expresses an \u2022 opinion similar to that expressed by Wills J. but states that such opinion is unnecessary to the decision of the case and it is clearly obiter.\nThe Bellcairn was not a case involving joint liability. The facts are accurately summarized in the head-note which reads as follows:\nIn an action for damages by collision between the owners of the A. and the B., the Court, by consent of the parties, made a decree dismissing the action. Subsequently another action was brought by the owners of the cargo on the A. against the B. in respect of the same collision, and the Court found both vessels to blame. The owners of the B. then commenced an action against the owners of cargo on the A. for the purpose of limiting their liability in respect of all claims arising out of this collision, and paid the amount of their statutory liability into court. Subsequently, again by consent of the owners of the A. and the B., the assistant registrar rescinded the decree by consent in the first action, and the owners of the A. then brought in a claim in the limitation action against the fund in court. The registrar held such claim to be inadmissible. On motion to confirm the report:\u2014\nHeld, that the report should be confirmed, as the owners of the A. and B. could not by consent rescind the decree of the Court, and that the decree by consent was a bar to a claim against the fund in court, as it estopped the owners of the A. from bringing any further action against the B.\nIt would seem clear that so long as the judgment in the action first mentioned in the head-note was in existence it would estop the owners of the A. from bringing any further action against the B. and the case, therefore, appears, at a first reading, to raise directly the question of the effect of the consent order setting aside that judgment. When, however, the reasons of the Court of Appeal are examined it appears that the Court dealt with the matter as if the judgment had not been set aside at all. Lord Esher M.R. said at pages 165 and 166:\u2014\nIt is clear that if the judgment of the 7th of November, 1884, be valid and standing, the owner of the Britannia can have no claim against the Bellcairn. The sole question therefore is whether this judgment has been set aside. I agree with Butt, J., that when at a trial the Court gives a judgment by the consent of the parties it is a binding judgment of the Court and cannot be set aside by a subsequent agreement between the solicitors, or the parties, even though it be placed in the form of an order by consent on a summons and taken to a registrar or master, and by him made as a matter of course. It is only the Court, with full knowledge of the facts on which it is called on to act, which can set aside the first judgment, and I doubt whether, unless some fraud in regard to such judgment is shewn, even the Court would have jurisdiction to set aside its first judgment. It is clear then that the second consent order was absolutely void, and would have been of no validity in an action between the Britannia and the Bellcairn, in which the judgment of the 7th of November was relied on as a bar.\nCotton, L.J. says, in part, at page 166:\u2014\nI am of the same opinion. The judgment of the 7th of November was a bar to any action by the owners of the Britannia against the Bellcairn, and if such judgment could have been set aside at all, it could only have been done by the Court with all the facts before it.\nThese passages would seem to indicate that in the view of Lord Esher and of Cotton L.J. the consent order was made without jurisdiction and was absolutely void. The words used by Lord Esher, which I have italicized, are open to the interpretation that if the first judgment had been validly set aside the bar to the later action would have been removed. I have already indicated my view that in the case at bar it cannot be said that the order of Egbert J. was void or was made without jurisdiction.\nCross and Co. v. Matthews and Wallace (supra) is a decision of the Divisional Court delivered by Lord Alverstone C.J. with the concurrence of Wills and Kennedy JJ. The head-note reads as follows:\u2014\nTwo defendants, M. and W., having been sued in the High Court for goods sold and delivered, judgment was entered against M., and the action as against W. was remitted for trial to the County Court. At the trial it was found that the debt was contracted by W. alone, and that M. had merely acted as his agent.\nJudgment was postponed, and the judgment against M. was set aside. The learned County Court Judge then entered judgment against W.\nHeld, that the judgment against W. was wrong, as the plaintiffs had conclusively elected to enforce their remedy against M.\nIt will be observed that Matthews and Wallace were alternatively and not jointly liable. The concluding sentence of Lord Alverstone's judgment is as follows:\nI am of opinion that the County Court judge ought to have given judgment for the defendant on the ground that the plaintiffs had conclusively elected to enforce their remedy against Matthews. The appeal must, therefore, be allowed.\nIt would appear that the signing of judgment against Matthews was treated as conclusive evidence of an election to look to him for payment instead of to Wallace and that this was the real ratio decidendi of the case, but there is no doubt that Lord Alverstone used language approving of the observations of Wills J. in Hammond v. Schofield.\nM. Brennen and Sons v. Thompson (supra) was a case of principal and agent. The plaintiffs sued T., the agent, and L. and C, the undisclosed principals, in one action in the County Court. They signed judgment by default against T. but then moved in the same action asking to set aside the judgment against T. The County Court Judge made an order setting aside the default judgment and giving the plaintiffs leave to amend the statement of claim. From this order L. and C. appealed. As in Cross and Co. v. Matthews and Wallace, this was a case not of joint but of alternative liability and, as in Hammond v. Schofield, the appeal was from the order setting aside the default judgment. The Court was not called upon to consider what would have been the result had the default judgment been validly set aside by an order from which no appeal was taken.\nIn my view, in none of the five cases mentioned was it determined as part of the ratio decidendi that where a judgment is recovered against some one of a number of persons who are jointly liable on the same contract but is set aside by a valid order such judgment nonetheless continues to constitute a bar to an action against the others. It is my present view that even where the order setting such judgment aside was made on consent and no grounds existed for setting it aside against the opposition of the plaintiff, the effect of the judgment as a bar to a subsequent action is destroyed by the order setting it aside and, to use the words of Manisty J. in Partington v. Hawthorne 38, it \"has gone, and is as if it never had been made.\" Once it-has been decided that the order of Egbert J. was made with jurisdiction its merits cannot be inquired into in this action and, so long as it remains unreversed, to borrow the words of Lord Mansfield, in Moses v. Macferlan, quoted above, \"It is conclusive as to the subject matter of it to all intents and purposes.\"\nI find nothing in the judgment of Parke B. in King v. Hoare (or in those of the Law Lords in Kendall v. Hamilton where it is discussed and approved) to support the view that had the judgment against Smith been set aside it would still have availed as a plea in bar to the subsequent action against Hoare. It will be observed that the plea there under consideration stated:\n\u2026 that the contract in the declaration was made by the plaintiff with the defendant and one N. T. Smith jointly, and not with the defendant alone ; and that, in 1843, the plaintiff recovered a judgment against Smith for the same debt, with costs, \"as appears by the record remaining in the Court of Queen's Bench, which judgment still remains in full force and unreversed,\" concluding with the common verification.\nI am at a loss to understand how any matter can be held to be res judicata by virtue of a judgment which once existed but has since been validly set aside.\nI am unable to accept the view expressed by Wills J. in Hammond v. Schofield in the following passage:\u2014\nI cannot see upon what principle the consent of the plaintiff and defendant can be allowed to create a new right, or (which is the same thing), to resuscitate an extinguished right in favour of the plaintiff against a third person, or to create on the part of a third person a new liability.\nThe consent of the plaintiff and the defendants there referred to did not, I respectfully think, purport to create a new right in the plaintiff but only to remove an obstacle in the way of the enforcement of a right theretofore existing.\nIf, contrary to the view that I have expressed, it is material to decide whether the order of Egbert J. must necessarily have been made with the consent of the respondent I think that such question should be answered in the negative for the following reasons. It appears to me that Barker had at least an arguable legal right to have the default judgment against him set aside. At common law, before the Judicature Act, Barker, being jointly liable to the plaintiff with his co-contractors was entitled to be sued in the same action with them and if he had been sued alone he would have had the right to plead in abatement. The Judicature Act abolished pleas in abatement but it did not change the rights of the parties, and, since the Judicature Act, if a party jointly liable with others is sued alone his remedy appears to be to move the Court to stay the action unless and until the plaintiff adds his co-contractors as defendants. No such remedy was open to Barker in the action brought against him because his co-contractors Singer and Belzberg were made defendants in that action. Having no defence on the merits against the plaintiff's claim Barker could not be criticized for failing to file a defence and he could not object to judgment being signed against him by default although it was not signed at the same time against his co-defendants because such a course was expressly permitted by rule 113. He had therefore no right to complain until the plaintiff discontinued the action as against the other two defendants. When this happened I think that Barker had a right to object that the procedure which the plaintiff had adopted of suing the three co-contractors, signing judgment against him and then discontinuing as against the other two had the effect of depriving Barker of his right to have his liability and that of his co-contractors determined in one action. This right is referred to in Kendall v. Hamilton and it is made clear that it was not taken away by the Judicature Act. See for example the statement of Lord Blackburn at page 544:\u2014\n\u2026 I cannot agree in what seems to be the opinion of the noble and learned Lord on my left (Lord Penzance) that the Judicature Act has taken away the right of the joint contractor to have the other joint contractors joined as Defendants, or made it a mere matter of discretion in the Court to permit it. With great deference I think that the right remains, though the mode of enforcing it is changed.\nWhat course then was open to Barker to enforce this right? It was, I think, to move the Court for whatever relief was appropriate to require the liabilities of the three defendants to be determined in one action and it would seem that the first step in obtaining such relief would be to ask to have the judgment against him set aside. It may well be that it was on this ground that Egbert J. set the judgment aside. Some support is found for this view in the following evidence of Mr. McLaws, as to what was said by counsel on the application before Egbert J.:\u2014\nA. \u2026 I mentioned to the judge that it was my opinion, acting for my client Barker, that there may be some question of contribution of Messrs. Belzberg and Singer with my client with respect to this debt and other facts which I knew about at that time.\nQ. And you say it was on account of the matter of contribution that \u2026\nA. Or joint liability, if you wish to put it that way.\nI do not think that it is an answer to this to say that it-appears from the contract of 1 April 1949 filed as Exhibit 3 that as between Barker, Singer and Belzberg, Barker was liable to pay the whole of their joint indebtedness to the plaintiff. The existence of such an agreement would not destroy Barker's right to insist that the liability of himself and of his co-contractors to the plaintiff should be determined in one action instead of being settled piece-meal.\nIt remains to consider the argument of the appellants that at the date of the commencement of this action the ' plaintiff had no cause of action. I think this argument must be rejected. The default judgment against Barker was available to the defendants as a plea in bar but I think it was rightly held in Partington v. Hawthorne and in Harper v. Township of East Flamborough, cited by my brother Kerwin, that it is sufficient to enable the plaintiff to succeed that such a bar was removed before the trial, even although it existed at the commencement of the action.\nFor the above reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the Appellants: Barron & Barron.\nSolicitors for the Respondent: Fisher, McDonald & Fisher.\n1 [1951] 3 W.W.R.

The equity of redemption was extinguished by the sale.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in Banco (Illsley C.J. and MacQuarrie J. dissenting)[1], affirming the decision of Hall J.[2] permitting the respondent Lobster Point Realty Corporation, the owner of the equity of redemption in mortgaged lands, to redeem after foreclosure and sale by the Sheriff.\nW. P. Potter, Q.C. for the appellant.\nDonald McInnes, Q.C. for Lobster Point Realty Corp., and L. B. P. Gould, respondents.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock, Estey and Cartwright, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nRAND J.:\u2014The question on which this appeal hinges is whether or not under the law of Nova Scotia the court has jurisdiction to allow a mortgagor of lands to redeem after a sale under decree but before conveyance and before a report has been made to the court and approved.\nSeveral special features of that law should first perhaps be mentioned. The rule, as far back as 1833, authorized and since then followed, is that long ago adopted in Ireland under which, instead of foreclosure as in England, the realization of a mortgage is by way of sale. The order formally forecloses the equity of redemption and directs a sale, but reserves a further right of redemption until the day of the sale. By c. 140, R.S.N.S. 1923, continuing, in this respect, the provision of preceding enactments, the sale, unless otherwise ordered by the court, shall be made by the sheriff of the county in which the lands lie, who is authorized to execute a deed which \"when delivered to the purchaser shall convey the land ordered to be sold.\" The purchaser can pay the price and the sheriff execute the deed immediately upon acceptance of the bid. The sheriff renders as report of the proceedings to the court, but whether that report must be confirmed is disputed. Rule 8 of Order 51 of the Supreme Court practice provides that where an order is made directing any property to be sold,\nthe same shall, unless otherwise ordered, be sold, with the approbation of the court or a judge, to the best purchaser that can be got, the same to be allowed by the judge, and all proper parties shall join in the sale and conveyance as the judge directs.\nThis, with an immaterial change, reproduces Order 51 of the Rules of the Supreme Court, 1883. This latter was, in turn, taken from Rule 13 of Order 35 adopted by the Court of Chancery in 1852 under the Chancery Procedure Act, c. 86, 15 & 16 Vitt. For the purposes of the matter before us, it is, in my opinion, of no significance that the rule applies, but on the assumption that it does, I examine the main question.\nBoth the general practice in the Court of Chancery and the statute here speak of a \"sale\" of land, and the decisions make it clear that the transaction is not confined to a mere voluntary payment of money in exchange for the conveyance.\nIn Ex parte Minor[3], 32 E.R. 1206, in which the question was the point of time at which the equitable ownership became attributed to the purchaser, Lord Eldon had this to say:\u2014\nThe question '(whether the purchaser must bear a loss by fire before confirmation of the sale) must depend upon the point, what is the date and time of the contract, at which it can be said to have been complete. Is the bidding in the Master's office the contract between the Court and the bidder; or only an authority to the Master to tell the Court, that if the Court approves, the Court may make a contract with him upon the terms proposed . . . In some of the cases that have been cited, the change of property is said to be from the date of the Report: in others from the time of the conveyance: so, that, though confirmed as the best purchaser, if he had not got the conveyance, he would have been entitled to say, the estate was not his. That cannot be according to the principle. Suppose, this person had insured the premises, while in the Master's office, from fire: would he according to the cases in late times have had an insurable interest? His interest is not near so thin as many, that have been considered insureable.\nThe decree was that the loss must fall upon the vendor and that there be deducted from the purchase price the amount of deterioration in value found by the master. But any inference that until the order of confirmation either the purchaser or the court could withdraw is clearly unwarranted. In Anon[4], after the report had been confirmed nisi, a motion made that the best bidder should complete his purchase and pay the money on or before a specified day was refused. In Lord Chancellor Loughborough's view, until confirmation the purchaser was always \"liable to have the biddings opened; until that non constat that he is the purchaser\": in other words, the purchaser could not be compelled to pay before confirmation of the report as the time fixed for performance, but with the implication that there is a 'continuing obligation and that he can be so ordered thereafter. In Else v. Barnard[5], property ordered to be sold by the court was bought in, but 'before the auctioneer had 'left the rostrum the unsuccessful bidder signed a contract to purchase it 'at the reserved price, improperly disclosed to him, slightly higher than the bid. Before confirmation, the purchaser repudiated and the question was whether he could do so. The Master of the Rolls, Sir John Romilly, holding that he could not, says:\u2014\nI do not, at this present time, go into the question or consider whether that is a sale by auction or not, but I think it is impossible for Mr. Courtauld to say that it is not to be treated as a sale by auction, for he signs a bidding paper, by which he agrees that it shall be so treated; it is impossible for him afterwards to say that he is not bound by it. . . I am of opinion that this amounts to a contract, by which he agrees that it shall be treated as a sale by auction; that he must be treated as the highest bidder at the sum of \u00a32,500; that he cannot repudiate his contract, but must be held to be the purchaser.\nIn Anson v. Towgood[6], where the question was when the purchase should be deemed to become effective to determine the right to receive interest on consols, Lord Eldon observed:\u2014\nCan anything turn upon the report not being confirmed? There was a case about a house being burned down before the confirmation of the report (ex parte Minor[7]). But if the tenant for life had died the same night, must not the purchase money have been paid? The report I think, when confirmed, must have relation back to the purchase; and the contract, I apprehend, was made the moment that the purchaser's name was entered in the Master's book. If the purchaser had lived till the 6th of July, and then died, he would have had nothing if he is not entitled to these dividends.\nIt is settled, too, that obedience to the contract can be enforced either 'by ordering a resale subject to the payment of all costs and any deficiency by the first purchaser or by attaching the latter to compel him to carry the bargain out: Lansdown v. Elderton[8]; Gray v. Gray[9].\nThe conclusion from this is that on the acceptance of a bid either a contract is entered into by the purchaser with the court in its own capacity or as representing the parties in interest, or in the case of Nova Scotia, conceivably with the sheriff, that the one will buy and the other sell the land, subject only to the approval of the report; or the purchaser submits to the jurisdiction of the court on those contractual terms. The obligations are reciprocal and from them neither the court nor the purchaser can withdraw except upon the failure of the condition; but, apart from consent, only by its operation, which is determined by rules of law, can the obligation and correlative right of the purchaser be destroyed.\nOn what grounds, then, may the court refuse to confirm? Although it would be impossible to enumerate them all, fraud, mistake, misconduct by the purchaser, error or default in the proceedings are well established. But the controlling fact to which these grounds give emphasis, is that the purchase can be defeated only by juridical action. To hold, on the other hand, that the court, acting otherwise than in setting aside the sale, can destroy such a right would be to attribute to it the repudiation of its own contract without proper cause.\nBut it is said that so long as the court retains the power of 'approval, the original jurisdiction to permit redemption is preserved and that this is a further condition to which the purchaser submits himself. Redemption in that case would be an act intercepting the approval, not a ground for refusing approval: and allowing it would, on the theory advanced, wipe out all steps following the order for sale. Since no case has been cited in which that has been done, we have no indication of how the resulting matters would be dealt with, such as the purchaser's discharge, the costs and expenses, the deposit, the reconveyance where the deed has been given before redemption. In the last situation, it would be extraordinary that the court should permit the instrument to remain outstanding.\nIf such a condition has, for the past century, been annexed to sales under decree, we surely would have some reference to it in the cases or in the standard works on equity practice; but the researches of counsel have failed to discover one instance in which such a power has been exercised in any jurisdiction within the British Commonwealth. There are a number of authorities directly in point from the United States: Brown v. Frost[10], holding that there was no power to redeem after a sale, although the mortgagee was the purchaser: Pennsylvania Company v. Broad St. Hospital[11], declaring that the mortgagor's right of redemption \"must be exercised before the sheriff's hammer falls\"; Parker v. Dacres[12], in which the United States Supreme Court, speaking through Harlan J. at p. 47 said:\u2014\nIn the view we take of this case it is unnecessary to express an opinion whether the provision relating to sales under execution, properly interpreted, give a right of redemption after sale under a decree of foreclosure. If it did not, the decree below must be affirmed, for a right to redeem, after sale, does not exist unless given by a statute.\nYoung's Appeal[13], in which Ross J. on appeal used this language:\u2014\nThe bona fide purchaser, at a public sale of land, the moment it is knocked off to him, if .he complies in all respects with the conditions of sale, instantly acquires a vested right to the property sold.\nand\nGibson v. Winslow[14], in which it is stated:\u2014\nThe moment the land was struck down, the interest of the purchaser attached.\nIn Gordon Grant & Co. v. Boos[15], action had been brought to enforce a mortgage of lands in Trinidad and for sale in default of payment. The property was sold by auction, purchased by the mortgagees and later disposed of for a much larger price. Thereafter the mortgagees sued in New York to recover on the personal covenant the mortgage debt less the amount realized on the sale under the decree. The mortgagor thereupon sought a declaration that his right to redeem had been revived and for an injunction, and the West Indian courts granted the latter relief. The Judicial Committee, speaking through Lord Phillimore, in reversing the judgment, had this to say on the nature of judicial sale:\u2014\nNo doubt the sale realized very little, and the mortgagee, who had leave to bid, apparently bought a valuable property for a small sum; and their Lordships can understand that the Courts in the West Indies may have felt some aversion to granting the mortgagee further advantages. But it was a judicial sale which is not impeached, and the mortgagor, who could have made a bid or procured a bid, must take the consequences.\nThere remains the question whether the existence of such a condition must be gathered from a uniform practice of the court in Nova Scotia, the disturbance of which might adversely affect existing rights or titles. The most diligent search by counsel has uncovered no case in which it has been directly decided. What is relied upon is Stubbings v. Umlah[16], decided in 1900, in which Meagher J. in an obiter dictum expressed himself as follows:\u2014\nAn absolute right of redemption exists in this Province, up to the completion of the sale, at least, if not, as I am inclined to think it does, up to the granting of the final order of confirmation.\nEven after that, especially where the plaintiff is the purchaser, and retains the title, the court, it seems to me, possesses a discretionary power to decree redemption, just as the court in England possesses such a power after a foreclosure order absolute has been made.\nThere is, therefore, at least, this distinction between our decree and the English final order: that, under the former, the right of redemption exists absolutely, pending the sale and final confirmation thereof; while under the latter, no such absolute right exists.\nAgain by the same judge when speaking for the court consisting of MacDonald C.J., Weatherbe and Meagher JJ. in Ritchie v. Pyke[17], but likewise obiter:\u2014\nUnder our practice which has prevailed for nearly half a century at least, no time for redemption is fixed where a sale is ordered, but the right to redeem, of course, endures until the proceedings have been finally confirmed by order of the court, after the sale, payment of the price, and conveyance to the purchaser have been completed.\nIn Wallace v. Gray[18], on the other hand, Graham E.J. at p. 288 said:\u2014\nIn this province, where there is no intervening step between the sale and the deed, no confirmation of sale, payment into court, inquiry as to title, settling and execution of the deed by the proper parties, etc., before the deed is given, all causing delay, the amount of deposit required is not important. The deed, upon the name being inserted, may be executed by the sheriff directly the hammer falls.\nand in Power v. Foster[19], at pp. 487 and 488, he speaks to the same effect:\u2014\nThe sale more resembling .a sale of land under execution followed by a deed executed by the sheriff, and not by the party, there has grown up a practice differing from that prevailing in other places. The deed is given by virtue of a statute; and the provisions applicable to this case would be the Act of 1890, Ch. 14, secs. 5, 6 and 10.\nI take this language to imply that the execution of the deed under statutory authority would end the matter; but if, contrary to his apparent understanding of the practice, confirmation should be necessary, then the contract would be subject only to the setting aside, on proper grounds, of the proceedings themselves.\nThe question seems to have been raised still earlier. In Slayter v. Johnston[20], a suit for redemption, Young C.J. at pp. 508-9 said:\u2014\nWe are told that the foreclosure might be opened, which would be a strange thing, at the instance of the mortgagee, and a very startling thing if it could be done at the instance of the mortgagor in this country after a sale.\nand Wilkins J. at pp. 522 and 523:\u2014\nIf there had been, and there has not been, so far as we are informed, an instance in this Province, of opening a decree of foreclosure after sale, where there was no fraud or illegality, and if an authority were adduced, as there has not been, warranting us to take that judicial course in a case where a mortgagee elected to purchase at the sale; still, it would be our duty to proceed further, and, considering the origin of the doctrine contended for to inquire, how far it would consist with adjudicated cases, or (in the absence of these) with equitable principles, to apply it to such a case as this.\nIn Bigelow v. Blaiklock (undated but between July, 1873 and December, 1877) Russell's Equity Decisions of Ritchie E.J., the mortgagor claimed a re-sale on the ground of a misunderstanding at the sale because the properties were described differently in the advertisement and in the mortgage and writ. He was held entitled to a re-sale notwithstanding that the mortgagee, after having purchased at the sale, had agreed to sell one of the lots, since he had obtained no deed and the sale had not been confirmed. Ritchie E.J. at p. 25 said:\u2014\nThough I have in this case ordered a resale on the grounds I have stated, the plaintiff being the purchaser, and under similar circumstances the result might have been the same if a stranger, possessed of the same knowledge, had been the purchaser, yet there is a manifest distinction between the plaintiff in a suit and a stranger; and I do not wish it to be inferred from what I have said, that in a case where the plaintiff himself has bid on the mortgaged property, and the amount of principal, interest and costs is tendered to him before the deed is given and the sale confirmed, he would not be required to take it and give up the purchase. This point, however, is not before me at present.\nIn Diocesan Synod N.S. v. O'Brien (1879) Russell's Equity Decisions, 352, a purchaser at a foreclosure sale who had made a deposit of 10 per cent as required by the terms of the sale refused to complete on the ground that a good title in fee simple could not be given. The Court declined to enforce specific performance, but ordered the payment of the deposit to the mortgagee. Ritchie E.J. at p. 354 remarked:\u2014\nInasmuch as the terms of sale are clear and unambiguous, \u2022and the purchaser by paying the balance of the purchase money could have got all that he bid for and agreed to buy, he cannot recover back the deposit, the vendor being willing to convey to him all that was offered for sale.\nIt would seem to be an astonishing proposition that the sale under such a power and a fortiori, the title, before confirmation, should still carry with it an inverted equitable clog of a right to redeem. Between the conveyance and the confirmation, the property might have passed through the hands of several bona fide purchasers; what would their position be? Would they, through their notice of the title at sale, be bound by that equity? The judicial statements brought to our attention pertinent to this are those first of Jessel M.R. in Campbell v. Holyland[21]:\u2014\nUnder what circumstances that discretion should be exercised is quite another matter. The mortgagee had a right to deal with an estate acquired under foreclosure absolute the day after he acquired it; but he knew perfectly well that there might be circumstances to entitle the mortgagor to redeem, and everybody buying the estate from a mortgagee who merely acquired a title under such an order was considered to have the same knowledge, namely, that the estate might be taken away from him by the exercise, not of a capricious discretion, but of a judicial discretion by the Court of Equity which had made the order.\nand of Meredith, C.J.C.P., to the same effect, in Dovercourt Land Building & Savings Co. v. Dunevegan Heights Land Co.[22]. But proceedings in foreclosure and those for sale under statutory authority are essentially different: the one deals with an equitable creation of the court, the equity of redemption, the other with a statutory power to convey both the legal and beneficial interests of the mortgagor in the land. I am quite unable to accept the view that the statutory sale is burdened with a discretionary right of redemption in the absence of an express term in the conditions of sale, or an undisputed practice or rule of court; whether such a term, practice or rule could 'be annexed to the power where the intention that it should be so could not be inferred from the legislation, it is unnecessary to consider: nothing of the sort is present here. A sale under a power in the mortgage or given to the mortgagee by statute means what the term implies, a power to make an out-and-out transfer of ownership: Waring (Lord) v. London & Manchester Assurance Co.[23]; Saltman v. McColl[24], on what ground, then, should we attach to a like statutory power given the court a collateral condition that can nullify its exercise?\nThat no disturbance of titles could result from its rejection in this case admits of no doubt. If a purchaser has acquiesced in a redemption notwithstanding his contract, it would mean that he had abandoned it or that it had with his consent been rescinded or otherwise terminated. If there had been a conveyance, the contract had become fully executed and he must have re-conveyed or acquiesced in an order setting it aside, which he would now be estopped from questioning: in either case, if acting under a mistake, it would have been as to his rights in law.\nThe question of the right to raise before us the point of the discretionary jurisdiction to permit redemption, which had been decided in an earlier appeal to the Court en banc, was challenged. The issue here is between the mortgagor and the purchaser in which the mortgagee is not interested, and although the action was brought in 1948, that issue arose only in 1950. By s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act this Court has jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal from the first ruling, and in the circumstances, but without touching the question of our right, in this appeal, to deal with the first judgment without it, leave is given and all necessary ancillary orders made, to enable the question now to be dealt with.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and direct the conveyance of the lands in accordance with the contract made at sale. The appellant will have her costs in this Court and in the Court en banc on the second motion: there will be no costs of the first motion to the Court en banc or on either application in chambers.\nLOCKE J. :\u2014This is an appeal by Alberta C. Pew, a purchaser of lands at a mortgage sale, from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco by which an appeal of the present appellant from a judgment of Hall J., where by the respondent corporation was declared to be entitled to redeem the lands in question and in respect of which an order for foreclosure 'and sale had been made upon the application of the respondent Zinck was dismissed.\nThe facts, in so far as they appear to me to be relevant, are as follows: On September 30, 1929, the respondent Zinck conveyed to the respondent Gould, Sr. the lands in question, in consideration of the payment of a sum in cash and the granting of a mortgage dated October 23, 1929, to the said Zinck in the sum of $25,000, the balance of the purchase price, such sum to be repaid in instalments over a period of eight years. In the year 1931 Gould conveyed the lands, subject to the mortgage, to the respondent corporation. During the interval between this conveyance and February 26, 1948, when the writ in the present action was issued, there were various defaults in payment under the mortgage: in the year 1934 mortgage foreclosure proceedings were instituted by Zinck and an order for foreclosure and sale made but these proceedings were not carried to a conclusion, the parties entering into an agreement extending the time for payment of the mortgage moneys: this was followed by other agreements the last of which was made on October 1, 1938, which substituted new terms and times for payment for those provided by the mortgage. In the present action the plaintiff alleged a series of defaults on the part of the mortgagor and the respondent corporation in respect of instalments and interest and principal and interest due under the terms of the mortgage, as amended by the said agreement, and in payment of various taxes and claimed payment of the principal amount due with accumulated interest.\nand in default of payment foreclosure of the said mortgage as altered or modified by the said agreement of the 1st of October 1938 and\/or rescission of the said Agreement, sale of the mortgaged premises and possession of the same; and if the purchase money is insufficient to pay what is found to be due to the plaintiff for principal, interest, insurance premium, taxes, rates, charges and interest and costs of this action the plaintiff further claims an order for judgment for the payment of the deficiency against the defendant, Lyttleton B. P. Gould, mortgagor as aforesaid.\nWhile the defendant corporation and Gould entered a statement of defence to the action, they did not appear when the action was set down for trial and on November 25, 1949, Parker J., after hearing evidence for the plaintiff proving the various defaults and the amount of the sum due, found that the amount due on the mortgage and on the agreement was the sum of $15,266.10 as of October 2, 1949, with interest on the principal sum secured at the rate of six per cent from that date and directed that the interest of the respondent corporation in the lands and premises be foreclosed and that the property be sold. The formal judgment was entered on December 16, 1949, and included the following terms:\u2014\nAND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the estate, interest and equity of redemption of the Defendant, Lobster Point Realty Corporation, and of all parties claiming or entitled 'by, through or under the Defendant, Lobster Point Realty Corporation, in the lands and premises described in the Mortgage be forever BARRED AND FORECLOSED and that a sale of the mortgaged property described in the statement of Claim herein be made by the Sheriff of the County of Lunenburg after four notices in the \"Chronicle-Herald\" and in the \"Mail-Star\" newspapers published at 'Halifax in the County of Halifax alternatively by two notices in each of the said newspapers for at least thirty days prior to the day appointed for such sale and by one notice in the \"Progress-Enterprise\" newspaper published at Lunenburg, in the County of Lunenburg for at least 30 days prior to the day appointed for such sale and by handbills :posted in the municipality of Chester in the County of Lunenburg for at least twenty days before the day appointed for such sale.\nThis was followed by a direction that unless before the day appointed for the sale the amount found due, together with the costs and disbursements thereafter referred to, should 'be paid to the plaintiff:\u2014\nthe said Sheriff shall proceed to sell and execute to the purchaser or purchasers thereof at such sale a Deed or Deeds conveying and which shall convey to him or them all the estate, right, title, interest, claim, property and demand of the Mortgagor, Lyttleton B. Gould and of the defendant, Lobster Point Realty Corporation, owner of the equity of redemption, and of each of them at the time of the making of the Mortgage and at the time of the making of the Agreement foreclosed in this action, or at any time since, and of all parties claiming or entitled by, from or under the original Mortgagors or either of them of, in and to the lands purchased at such sale.\nThis was followed by a term providing for the disposition by the sheriff of the proceeds of the sale, for paying the arrears of taxes upon the lands, the costs of the proceedings, the amount found due as the mortgage debt and interest, the amount paid by the plaintiff for fire insurance premiums on the property and the balance, if any, to the Accountant General of the Supreme Court to abide further order.\nThe property was duly advertised for sale by the sheriff in accordance with the directions of the judgment and on March 25, 1950, 'bids were asked at public auction and on behalf of the appellant Edmund Fader offered the sum of $18,000, a bid which was accepted by the sheriff. The plaintiff's agent, Edmund Fader, thereupon paid to the sheriff a sum of $2,300 on account of the purchase money and, at the sheriff's request, signed a memorandum endorsed on the back of one 'of the posters advertising the sale which read as follows:\u2014\nLunenburg, N.S.\nMarch 25, 1950.\nI acknowledge purchasing at foreclosure sale this day the property as within described for the sum of $18,000.\nEdmund Fader\nAgent for Mrs. Alberta C. Pew of Ardmore, Penn.\nMarried Woman.\nFader then inquired from the solicitor for the plaintiff as to when he could expect to receive a deed of the property, saying that he would be prepared to pay the balance of the purchase price whenever it was ready and was referred by the solicitor to the sheriff. On April 21, 1950, Fader, accompanied by the solicitor for Mrs. Pew, attended upon the sheriff and paid the balance of the purchase price of $18,000 and asked for a deed. On May 22, 1950, the solicitors for the plaintiff moved before Hall, J. for an order to confirm the sale and on this application the respondent corporation and the respondent Gould were represented by counsel and asked that an order be made declaring that the respondent corporation was entitled to redeem the property. Mrs. Pew was also represented by counsel on this application. After argument, Hall J. made an order to the effect that the respondent corporation was entitled to redeem the property sold, by paying to the plaintiff the sums specified in the order for foreclosure and sale. and certain sums for costs on or before May 8, 1950, and redirecting that if such redemption took place the sheriff should refund to Mrs. Pew the amounts paid on her behalf to the sheriff.\nBy order of the Supreme Court in banco, Mrs. Pew was granted leave to appeal from this order and, on this appeal, the order of Hall J. was set aside and the matter remitted to him to permit the respondent Zinck to renew his motion to confirm the sale, the respondent corporation, the respondent Gould and the present appellant to be at liberty to file further affidavits upon the renewal of the hearing. All of the members of the Court were of the opinion that, despite the sale, the Court was not in the circumstances without power to permit redemption. On April 10, 1951, Hall J., after again hearing the matter and considering the further material, found that the respondent corporation should be permitted to redeem upon the terms set out in his previous order. The present appellant appealed from this order and by the decision of the majority of the members of the Court the appeal was dismissed. Ilsley C.J. and MacQu'arrie J. who dissented, were of the opinion that the material filed did not disclose a proper case for such relief and would accordingly have set aside the order of Hall J.\nNo objection of any kind is made to the regularity of the proceedings taken by the plaintiff in the action up to the time of the holding of the sheriff's sale. While in asking for an extension of time for redemption the respondent Corporation and Gould filed some evidence in the form of affidavits, in an endeavour to show that the sale had been made at an undervalue, it is not suggested that this was a ground for impeaching the regularity of the sale. The present appellant was an entire stranger to the proceedings up to the time the sale was held. It is said on her part that it was unnecessary that any application should have been made by the plaintiff in the action to confirm the sale. The question to be determined on this appeal is as to the nature of the rights of a purchaser at such a sale which, assuming confirmation to be necessary, has not been confirmed.\nThe appellant who had been permitted to intervene in the litigation by a rule of the Court did not appeal from the first judgment of the Court in banco. The question as to whether the first judgment of that Court in which it was decided that the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia might in a proper case extend the time for redemption after a sale has been held, pursuant to the judgment of the Court, was a final judgment and whether, accordingly there having been no appeal, the matter was to this extent res judicata, has been argued before us. The appellant, while contending that that judgment was interlocutory in its nature, asks leave to appeal if we should be of a contrary opinion. Since the issues raised on the appeal arise entirely from matters occurring after the 1949 amendment to s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, this Court has, in my opinion, jurisdiction to grant such leave and, without expressing a decided opinion as to it being necessary, I would, in the circumstances of this case, grant leave to the present appellant to appeal from the first judgment.\nIn deciding that in a proper case the Court might permit redemption on the application of the mortgagor after the premises had been sold by the sheriff pursuant to a judgment of the Court, the majority of the learned Judges of the Supreme Court in banco expressed the view that a statement of the law made by Sir George Jessel M.R. in Campbell v. Holyland[25], might properly be applied. In that case, after saying that an order for foreclosure, according to the practice of the old Court of Chancery, was never really absolute and that the principle applied has always been that, though a mortgage is in form an absolute conveyance when the condition is broken in equity it is always security, and that courts of equity interfered with the actual contract to this extent by permitting redemption after foreclosure in a proper case where the mortgagee retained title or control of the property, the Master of the Rolls said in part (p. 172) :\u2014\nUnder what circumstances that discretion should be exercised is quite another matter. The mortgagee had a right to deal with an estate acquired under foreclosure absolute the day after he acquired it; but he knew perfectly well that there might be circumstances to entitle the mortgagor to redeem, and everybody buying the estate from a mortgagee who merely acquired a title under such an order was considered to have the same knowledge, namely, that the estate might be taken away from him by the exercise, not of a capricious discretion, but of a judicial discretion by the Court of Equity which had made the order.\nReliance was also placed upon a passage from the judgment of Meredith C.J.C.P. in Dovercourt Land Building and Savings Co. v. Dunvegan Heights Land Co.[26], which reads (p. 108) :\u2014\nIt is accurately said that a Court of Equity is always ready to hear a meritorious application for relief against a foreclosure, and will open it whenever good and substantial reasons for such a course are shown to it. . . the true equitable principle has always been that the mortgagor may be permitted to redeem when the equities in favour of it undoubtedly outweigh all that are against it.\nThis statement of the learned Chief Justice was founded primarily on what had been said by the Master of the Rolls in Campbell v. Holyland (supra).\nThe accuracy of that portion of the judgment of Sir George Jessel which is above italicized has not as yet been considered in this Court. Since the present case is as to the status of a purchaser at a judicial sale, it is not necessary for the disposition of this matter to consider it. It may be noted, however, in passing, that the purchaser whose rights were considered in that case had not purchased the property from the mortgagee after foreclosure, rather had he purchased the mortgagee's interest after the decree nisi but before the granting of the decree absolute. While it was Campbell, the mortgagee, who applied for the decree absolute, he did so on behalf of the purchaser Ford. At the time of the transaction between these persons, therefore, Campbell had not acquired title to the mortgaged property and could sell merely his interest as mortgagee. These being the facts, the portion of the quotation to which I refer was clearly obiter.\nIn considering the position of the appellant after her bid for the property was accepted by the sheriff and she had, through her agent, paid part of the purchase money and bound herself to pay the balance, the question as to the necessity of thereafter obtaining an order approving the sale while not, in my opinion, decisive, should be considered. The order for the sale of the property in this matter was made under the powers vested in the Court by An Act relating to the Law and Transfer of Real Property (c. 140, R.S.N.S. 1923), by The Judicature Act (e. 32, Statutes of N.S. 1919) and by Rules of Court made under powers conferred on the Judges of the Supreme Court by statute and having legislative approval. Rule 8 of Order 51 of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia provides that where a judgment or order is given or made directing any property to be sold:\u2014\nthe same shall, unless otherwise ordered, be sold, with the approbation of the court or a judge, to the 'best purchaser that can be got, the same to be allowed by the judge, and all proper parties shall join in the sale and conveyance as the judge directs.\nThe text of this rule, with a slight change which does not alter its meaning, is taken from Rule 3 of Order 51 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1883, adopted in England in that year. The English Rule 3, in turn, was in the same terms as Rule 13 of Order 35 adopted in the Court of Chancery on October 16, 1852, under powers conferred upon the Judges by s. 48 of the Chancery Procedure Act (c. 86, 15 & 16 Vict.). Prior to the Chancery Procedure Act there was no statutory authority in England for a sale of property in proceedings upon a mortgage and the practice, unlike that in Ireland, was to order a foreclosure. The Rules of Court made under the Chancery Procedure Act adopted the practice which had theretofore been followed in regard to sales of land in administration and other like actions. That practice is described in the first edition of Daniel's Chancery Practice, Vol. 2, p. 92, published in 1837. If, at the sale, a sufficient bid was obtained, the bidder was required to sign a memorandum whereby he agreed to become the purchaser of the property, and, thereafter, to procure a report of the Master showing the result of the sale and then apply to the Court by motion for its confirmation.\nWhile Rule 13 of Order 35 of the Court of Chancery was supplemented 'by other rules defining the procedure to be followed, which was in effect simply 'an adoption of the previous practice, in my opinion, the language 'of the rule itself made it clear that, after the holding of the sale directed by the order, the approval 'of the Court was to be obtained. The sale was to be made, with the approbation of the Judge, \"to the best purchaser that can be got, the same to be allowed by the Judge.\" Clearly, \"the same\" refers to a sale that had been held. There are further rules supplementing Rule 3 of Order 51 and the form prescribed in the conditions of sale (Form 15, Appendix L), requires in terms that the approval of the Court be obtained after the sale. While there are no such rules supplementing Rule 8 of Order 51 and the only conditions of sale were, in the present matter, those contained in the judgment entered pursuant to the order of Parker J. on December 16, 1949, Rule 8 is, in my opinion, to be construed in the same manner as the English Rules and, after the sale has been held, the approval of the Judge must be obtained.\nFor the appellant it is, however, contended that Order 8 does not apply to sales which are ordered in foreclosure proceedings. This 'argument is based upon the fact that the twelve rules which form part of Order 51 are grouped under sub-headings, namely \"Lunatics and Infants' Estates\" under which Rules 1 to 5 appear, \"Sales in Other Cases\" under which appear Rules 6 to 9 and \"Foreclosure Sale\" under which Rules 10 to 12 are to be found. The contention is that Rule 8 accordingly applies to sales other than those ordered in proceedings under a mortgage. I think this argument fails. Order 8 of Rule 51 first appeared in the Rules of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia as Rule 3 of Order 42 in c. 25 of the Statutes of 1884. Rule 3 was one of four rules in Order 42, all of which appeared under a sole heading \"Sales by the Court.\" In the revision of the statutes in that year, c. 25 became c. 104 and Order 42 became Order 51. Instead of the general heading \"Sales by the Court,\" sub-headings, namely, \"Lunatics and Infants' Estates\" containing Rules 1 to 5, \"Generally\" under which Rules 6 to 9 were grouped and \"Foreclosure\" under which Rules 10 to 12 appeared. In 1900 the statutes were again revised and the Judicature Act re-enacted as c. 155. In this revision, the sub-title \"Generally\" in Order 51 was changed to read as at present \"Sales in Other Cases\" and the sub-heading \"Foreclosure\" changed to \"Foreclosure Sale.\" When the statutes were revised in 1923 these subheadings remained unchanged. The revision of the statutes in the year 1900 was authorized by c. 44 of the statutes of that year. Section 12(3) of that Act reads:\u2014\nThe marginal notes and headings in the body of the said Revised Statutes and references to former statutes or provisions shall be held to form no part of the said statutes, but to be inserted for convenience or reference only.\nA like provision appears in s. 12(3) of c. 12 of the Statutes of 1921, which authorized the revision which was carried out in 1923. While Orders 10, 10A, 11 and 12 deal with certain matters applicable only to mortgage sale proceedings, their subject matter is different from that of Rule 8 providing, as they do, for cases where in any action for foreclosure or sale a sale is sought by a subsequent mortgagee or encumbrancer, directing that where a sale is ordered in default of payment it shall be conducted by the sheriff of the county in which the lands lie, providing for a judgment for any deficiency after the sale and the distribution of the surplus, if any such results, requiring the mortgagee to convey the mortgaged premises if the amount found due is paid before the sale, and dealing with sales where the lands to be sold are situate partly in two counties. Only in Rule 8 is to be found the provision that where a sale is ordered it shall, unless otherwise ordered, be sold, with the approbation of the Court or a Judge, to the best purchaser that can be got, the same to be allowed by the Judge, and providing that all proper parties shall join in the sale and conveyance as the Judge directs. The subheading \"Sales in Other Cases\" is, I think, misleading: the scope of the rule was more 'accurately described 'by the word \"Generally\" under which it appeared in the revision of 1884.\nRule 3 of Order 51 of the English Rule has been applied in mortgage sale proceedings in England since 1883 and, in my opinion, the Nova Scotia Rule 8 was directed towards such proceedings from the time it was enacted in 1884. This view, I think, finds further support in the provisions of c. 136, R.S.N.S. 1900 and in c. 140, R.S.N.S. 1923. Section 14 of each of these statutes authorized the Supreme Court or any judge thereof to order the sale of real property in all cases in which any court or a judge in England has power to order such a sale. Section 15 provides that where an order of sale has been made the property shall be sold, unless the court or a judge otherwise orders, by the sheriff of the county in which the land or part of the land lies. Section 16 provides that the deed shall be executed by the person authorized to make the sale and that, when delivered to the purchaser, it shall convey the land ordered to be sold. Section 17 provides that all sales theretofore made by any person authorized by the court or a judge shall be deemed to be good and effective to vest the title of the land in the purchaser, although such deeds were not confirmed by the court or a judge. Order 8 prescribes the manner in which the powers vested in the court by s. 14 shall be 'exercised and deals with matters not dealt with elsewhere.\nUpon this aspect of the matter, I am of the opinion that the rule of court and the established practice required either the mortgagee plaintiff or the sheriff to apply to the Court for its approval of the sale to the 'appellant. If I correctly appreciate the contention of the respondent Corporation, it is that, this being so, it cannot be said that the equity of redemption has been extinguished by the sale and that the matter still being under the control of the Court an order extending the time for redemption might properly be made.\nThe question is one of great importance, not only in Nova Scotia but in other provinces where Rule 3 of Order 51 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1883 has been adopted verbatim. I can perceive no logical reason why the position of a purchaser at a sale regularly held under the direction of the court in proceedings upon a mortgage is to be 'distinguished from that of a purchaser at mortgage sale proceedings regularly conducted 'by a mortgagee out of court. While vast numbers of such sales have been held in various parts of Canada, I am not aware of any case in which a sale regularly made by a mortgagee upon default by the mortgagor has been set aside on the sole ground that the mortgagor is able and desires to redeem, nor have we been referred to any case in which the principle enunciated by Sir George Jessel in Campbell v. Holyland has been applied after a mortgage sale regularly held. The only case which I have been able to find in which such a contention was made, other than the present, is Saltman v. McColl[27]. In that case, after sale proceedings regularly taken by a mortgagee of land under the Real Property Act of Manitoba, whereby the property was sold to a bona fide purchaser who made the first payment called for by the terms of sale and bound himself to complete the purchase, the mortgagor brought an action for redemption. It was contended for the mortgagor that the property had been disposed of at a gross undervalue, that the purchaser had made default in payment of the second instalment of the purchase price and, therefore, was not entitled to as great consideration by a court of equity as was the mortgagor, as the equities being equal the first in point of time should prevail and that since the sale had not been completed by conveyance the mortgagor was entitled to redeem. There was no allegation of fraud or irregularity in the conduct of the sale other than that the property had been sold for much less than it was worth and Macdonald J. dismissed the action. The plaintiff appealed and the report of the argument shows that Campbell v. Holyland (supra) and Trinity College v. Hill[28], in which Campbell's case had been applied, and Stubbings v. Umlah[29], were cited on behalf of the appellant. The Court dismissed the appeal without calling on counsel for the respondent\u2014unfortunately no written reasons were given.\nPrior to 1867 there was a practice in England described as opening the biddings under which, after property had been sold at a judicial sale, if a better offer was made before confirmation of the sale it might be accepted. In discussing the position of a purchaser whose bid had been accepted at a sale, Loughborough L.C. in 1794, in a case reported as Anon[30], where emotion was made that a person reported to be the best bidder should complete his purchase and pay in the money at a time when the report had been confirmed nisi but not absolutely, said that he felt a difficulty as, until confirmation, the purchaser was always liable to have the biddings opened and until that non constat that he is the purchaser. The practice of opening biddings was abolished by the Sale of Lands by Auction Act 1867 (30-31 Vict. c. 48, s. 7) which provided that in sales held thereafter in the Court of Chancery the highest bona fide bidder at the sale, provided he shall have, bid a sum equal to or higher than the reserved bidder, shall 'be declared the purchaser, unless the Court or Judge should on the ground of fraud or improper 'conduct in the management of the sale either open the biddings, hold the bidder bound by his bidding or discharge him from being the purchaser and order the land to be resold.\nIt was, I think, for the reason that the sales conducted under orders of the Court in England were thus not absolute prior to 1867 that in the first edition of Daniel's Chancery Practice published in 1837, Vol. 2, pages 909 and 910, it was said that, while in ordinary sales by auction or by private agreement a contract is complete when the agreement is signed, a different rule prevails in sales before a Master where the purchaser is not considered as entitled to the benefit of his contract until the Master's report of the purchaser's bidding is absolutely confirmed. This is explained in the judgment of Sugden, L.C. in Vesey and Elwood[31]. Daniel's further statement that the bidder not being considered as the purchaser until the report is confirmed is not liable to any loss 'by fire or otherwise which may happen to the estate in the interim, is based upon a decision of Eldon L.C. in Ex parte Minor[32].\nThe judgment ordering the sale in the present matter directed that a sale of the mortgaged property be made by the sheriff of the County of Lunenburg after such sale had been advertised in the manner provided by the judgment and that the sheriff should execute to the purchaser a deed conveying all the estate or interest of the respondent Gould and the respondent 'Corporation in the said lands. This was the subject matter of the sale and purchase. The sale was made in exercise of a statutory power which authorized an outright sale of the interest of these respondents in the property. The respondent's contention is that, conceding this to be so, none the less the purchase was subject to the condition that if the mortgagor should find the money before the time when the judge's approval of the sale was given he might still be permitted to redeem. The respondent relies mainly upon two decisions in the courts of Nova Scotia to support this position. In Stubbings v. Umlah supra, Meagher J. said in part (p. 271) :\u2014\nA plea of foreclosure in England is not good, unless the foreclosure has been made absolute by the granting of a final order. Senhouse v. Earl[33].\nThe same principle should, it seems to me, apply with us, at least, until the sale has taken place, and, more than likely, until the order confirming it passed.\nIn a later case, Ritchie v. Pyke[34], Meagher J., delivering the judgment of a court consisting of McDonald C.J. and Weatherbe J. in addition to himself, said (p. 478) :\u2014\nUnder our practice, which has prevailed for nearly half a century, at least, no time for redemption is fixed where a sale is ordered; but the right to redeem, of course, endures until the proceedings have been finally confirmed by order of the court, after the sale, payment of the price, and conveyance to the purchaser have been completed.\nNo authorities were cited by Meagher J. for either of these statements. The statement in the later case, it will be noted, is more positive than that made in the earlier. These statements of the law, as has been pointed out in the judgments of the learned judges of the Supreme Court in banco were obiter and, with respect, they do not appear to me to be supported by authority, unless such is to be found in the judgment of Ritchie C.J. in Bigelow v. Blaik-lock, Russell's Equity Decisions, p. 23. In that case, at a sheriff's sale of property directed in proceedings upon a mortgage, the property to be sold was misdescribed. The mortgagee had purchased the property at the sale and thereafter had agreed to sell part of the property to a third person. Ritchie C.J. said that he took no account of the fact that the plaintiff had agreed to sell one of the lots; that he had no right to do Aso as he had obtained no deed and the sale had not been confirmed by the court, as required by its practice, and directed a resale. He then proceeded to say that, though he had ordered a resale, the plaintiff being the purchaser, and that under similar circumstances the result might have been the same if a stranger possessed of the same knowledge had been the purchaser, yet there was a manifest 'distinction between the plaintiff in a suit and a stranger. The learned judge did not refer to any authority in support of any of these statements and the exact nature of the difference which he considered to exist between the position of a stranger and that of a mortgagee plaintiff is not made clear.\nAs opposed to this, in Slayter v. Johnston[35], a suit in equity for the redemption of a mortgage, Young C.J., referring to an argument that the plaintiff should be permitted to redeem, said (p. 508) :\u2014\nWe were told that the foreclosure might be opened, which would be a strange thing, at the instance of the mortgagee, and a very startling thing if it could be done at the instance of the mortgagor in this country after a sale.\nWilkins J. (p. 522) said that there had not been, so far as the Court was informed, any instance in the Province of vacating a decree of foreclosure after sale where there was no fraud or illegality.\nIn Wallace v. Gray[36], the action was brought to set aside a sale directed in what were apparently proceedings for partition upon the ground of certain irregularities in the proceedings. Townshend J., referring to the fact that the plaintiff had been well aware of the alleged irregularities, said in part (p. 282) :\u2014\nNow the authorities are clear that it was his duty at the earliest moment to apply to a judge, before the sale was made, and that it is too late after the property has been knocked down and sold, as in this case, to an innocent purchaser. It would be most unjust if he were permitted to do so, and hurtful to the confidence placed in sales made under the authority of the court.\nWhatever may have been the practice prior to 1884, this case was decided after Rule 8 of Order 51 was enacted and, accordingly, the approval of the judge to the sale, after it has been held, was necessary.\nI think a sharp distinction is to be drawn between the position of a purchaser, such as the present appellant, and that of a mortgagee who has acquired title to the property by foreclosure and who retains it in his possession. Whether there is any distinction between the position of the appellant and one who equally in good faith, though aware that the title of a mortgagee had been acquired by foreclosure, purchases the property from the latter, it is unnecessary to decide. There is no evidence before us' that there was ever at any time a practice of opening the biddings in Nova Scotia such as existed in England prior to 1867. Doull J. says in his judgment on the first appeal that the practice does not seem to have existed, at any rate in that form, in Nova Scotia, then, however, proceeding to say that such sales were not made \"subject to the approbation of the court\" if the order for sale is followed. While there is no statute in Nova Scotia containing provisions similar to those of s. 7 of the Sale of Land by Auction Act 1867 in England, in my opinion, the decided cases do not support the view that a judicial sale of land in mortgage sale proceedings regularly conducted in accordance with the judgment of the court, as in the present case, may be set aside merely on the ground that the mortgagor has, after the event, succeeded in raising the mortgage money.\nIn Bennett v. Hamill[37], where the proceedings were to set aside a judicial sale on the ground of irregularities in the proceedings, Lord Redesdale L.C. said (p. 577) that the purchaser had a right to presume that the court had taken the steps necessary to investigate the rights of the parties and properly decreed a sale and that, if he gets a proper conveyance of the estate, his title ought not to be invalidated and that if the court went beyond this it would be to introduce doubts on sales made under the authority of the court, which would be highly mischievous.\nIn Matthie v. Edwards[38], Knight Bruce V.C., where the action was to set aside a sale made under the powers given by a mortgage, set aside the sale on the ground that it had been harsh, oppressive and inequitable. The action had been contested by the purchaser at the sale as well as by the mortgagee and, as to the former, the learned Judge said that there were facts in evidence more than sufficient to prevent his case from standing better than that of his vendor. On appeal, this judgment was reversed: 11 Jur. 504. Cottenham L.C., dealing with the ground upon which the judgment appealed from had proceeded, said (p. 505) :\u2014\nSuch a power as this may no doubt be used for purposes of oppression, but when conferred, it must be remembered that it is so by a bargain between one party and the other, and it is for the party who borrows to consider whether he is not giving too large a power to him with whom he is dealing. If the power is exercised for fraudulent purposes, this Court will interfere, and, as in other cases, if the party actually deposits in court the amount due, it will not allow the power to be exercised at all. The interests, however, of society require that these powers should not be interfered with, and there is no reason why they should be. The only fact alleged which might have affected the purchaser was apparently that his solicitor was also the solicitor for the mortgagee who conducted the sale proceedings on behalf of the latter, but Lord Cottenham found no evidence of impropriety in this. Heconsidered that to confirm the judgment of the Vice Chancellor would be to lay down a new rule for the interference of courts of equity.\nIn Adam v. Scott[39], where a sale by a mortgagee under a power of sale contained in the instrument was attacked on the ground that it had been made at an undervalue and that the mortgagor desired to redeem, Wood V.C. said that, assuming the allegations made for the plaintiff were all true, the plaintiff was bound to have shown that the power, the existence of which was stated in his bill, had been exercised improperly or contrary to its terms, that there had been some fraud attending the sale and that the purchasers had notice of such fraud. As nothing of this nature was alleged, the defendant's demurrer was allowed and the action dismissed.\nIn Shaw v. Bunny[40], a mortgagee, in exercise of a power of sale given by a mortgage, had sold part of the mortgaged property to the defendant who held a second mortgage on the property. The default was not denied or that the sale had been made in accordance with the power granted but it was objected that such a sale to a second mortgagee could not be supported. The Master of the Rolls had dismissed the action. On appeal, Knight Bruce L.J. said (p. 471):\u2014\nThe Master of the Rolls has held . . . that the second mortgagee has, under his purchase, in the absence of special circumstances, the same absolute and irredeemable title as a stranger purchasing would have had. And there being, I think, not any special circumstance in the present instance to prejudice or affect the purchaser's right, his title against the mortgagor to the benefit of the purchase seems to me also, as absolute as that of a mere stranger purchasing would have been.\nThe Court of Chancery was first vested with power to direct a sale of property in proceedings upon mortgages by the Chancery Procedure Act of 1852. We have not been referred to any such proceedings between the passage of that Act and of the statute of 1867 which abolished the practice of opening biddings, in which any such question as arises here, as to the rights of a purchaser at such a sale, was considered. Cases decided since that time must be considered, bearing in mind the provisions of s. 7 which has been referred to above. Its effect was considered by Peterson J. in re Joseph Clayton[41].\nSome of the cases decided after 1867 in mortgage sale proceedings out of court are of assistance, though s. 7 does not apply to them. In Warner v. Jacob[42], after a sale by a mortgagee in proceedings out of court, the mortgagor brought an action against the mortgagee and the purchaser for redemption, alleging that the sale had been made at an undervalue and for the purpose of embarrassing him. Kay J. referred to what had been said by Lord Cottenham in Jones v. Matthie[43] and by Vice-Chancellor Wood in Adams v. Scott[44] and said that if the mortgagee exercised the power of sale bona fide for the purpose of realizing the debt without corruption or collusion with the purchaser, the Court would not interfere even though the sale be very disadvantageous, unless indeed the price was so low as in itself to be evidence of fraud.\nIn Gentles v. Canada Permanent[45], the defendant mortgagee had advertised a sale of mortgaged premises and the property was knocked down to the plaintiff, who was declared to be the purchaser. The mortgagor who had made arrangements to pay the amount in default but, through mischance, had not tendered the amount before the sale, wished to redeem and the mortgagee thereupon informed the purchaser that it would not carry out the sale unless forced to do so by the Court. As the regularity of the proceedings was not impeached, Street J. directed specific performance.\nIn Huson v. Haddington[46], where a sale under proceedings by the mortgagee taken out of court was attacked on the ground that it had been made without due regard to the interests of the mortgagor and that the property had been sold at a great undervalue, the Court of Appeal set the sale aside. On appeal to the Judicial Committee, this judgment was reversed:[47]. The pleadings had not contained any charge of fraud or collusion or bad faith against the defendant purchasers and there had been no notice before trial that inadequacy of price would be relied upon as evidence thereof and the purchasers had accordingly given no counter-evidence of its sufficiency. Lord De Villiers, in delivering the judgment, made it clear that, in the absence of any allegation of fraud or collusion or bad faith or knowledge of the existence of facts which would invalidate the sale on the part of the purchasers, or any evidence of such, the action failed.\nIn Gordon Grant & Co. v. Boos[48], the lands had been sold at a sale directed in proceedings upon a mortgage in the Supreme Court of Trinidad. The appellants, the mortgagees of the property, having obtained leave to bid, purchased the property and subsequently sold it at a much larger price. Thereafter they sued the respondent in New York on his personal covenant for the balance found due on the mortgage, less the sum realized at the sale, where-upon the respondent brought an action for, redemption. Lord Phillimore, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, pointed out that, while the judicial sale had realized a very small amount, the regularity of the proceedings was not impeached and the mortgagor who could have made a bid or procured a bid must take the consequences.\nIn Waring (Lord) v. London and Manchester Assurance Co.[49], a mortgagor brought an action and moved for an injunction to restrain a mortgagee from giving a conveyance of the mortgaged property to a purchaser to whom it had been sold, in the exercise of the power of sale conferred by s. 101 of the Law of Property Act, 1925. An agreement for the sale of the property between the mortgagee and the purchaser had been completed but the conveyance had not yet been made. The report of the argument shows that it was contended by counsel for the plaintiff that the mere entering into of a contract for sale of the property comprised in a mortgage does not exclude the mortgagor's right of redemption. A further contention was that the sale was at a gross undervalue. Crossman J., in delivering judgment dismissing the motion, pointed out that the contract for the sale of the property entered into by the mortgagee was not conditional in any way. As to the argument that the plaintiff's equity of redemption had not been extinguished as there had been no completion by conveyance and the plaintiff was, accordingly, still entitled to redeem, he said that s. 101 of the Act, which gave to the mortgagee power to sell the mortgaged property, was perfectly clear and meant that the mortgagee had power to sell out and out by private contract or by auction and, subsequently, to complete by conveyance, and that the power to sell was a power by selling to bind the mortgagor. After saying that if that were not so the extraordinary result would follow that every purchaser from a mortgagee would, in effect, be getting a conditional contract liable at any time to be set aside by the mortgagor coming in and paying the principal, interest and costs, he said that it seemed to him impossible seriously to suggest that the mortgagor's equity of redemption remained in force pending completion of the sale by conveyance. Dealing with the argument as to the sale at an undervalue, he referred to what had been said by Kay J. in Warner y. Jacob and said that on the facts of the case before him it was impossible to conclude that the price was so low as to be evidence of fraud.\nIn the cases above referred to, other than that of Gordon Grant & Co. v. Boos, the sale proceedings were carried out either under powers of sale contained in the mortgage itself or under a statutory power of sale and were made out of court. In none of them, other than the Manitoba case, was the mortgagor's claim for relief based upon the grounds upon which the judgments in the present matter have proceeded. While, for the reasons which I have given, I think Rule 8 of Order 51 requires either the plaintiff in the action or the sheriff to ask the approval of the Court of the sale which had been made, in my opinion, the plaintiff and the present appellant were entitled, as of right, to such approval, since it is conceded that the sale had been conducted in the manner directed by the judgment.\nIt was the entire interest of the respondent Corporation and of the respondent Gould which was offered for sale under the judgment of Mr. Justice Parker and which the plaintiff purchased and, in my opinion, the regularity of the sale proceedings being conceded, the appellant's legal position following the sale and payment of part of the agreed purchase price and the execution on her behalf of an agreement binding her to pay the balance, did not differ from the position of the purchaser in Waring's case. In my opinion, the equity of redemption of the mortgagor was extinguished by the sale (Waldock on Mortgages, 2nd Ed. 377 and cases cited Note 279). Had the appellant refused to complete the purchase, a decree of specific performance might have been made against her (Else v. Barnard (1); Power v. Foster (2)). Upon application to the Court, she was, in my opinion, entitled to an order that the sheriff do deliver to her the deed of the property, as had been directed by the judgment of Parker J.\nFor these reasons, it is my opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the conveyance of the interest sold to the appellant directed. I agree with the order as to costs proposed by my brother Rand.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. P. Potter.\nSolicitor for the respondents, Lobster Point Realty Corp. and L. B. P.

When the work was nearly completed the defendant, who had been paid $1,000 on account, refused to do anything more until paid a further $3,000. Held: On the view of the evidence most favourable to the defendant, he deliberately abandoned the contract at a stage when the machine would not perform the work for which it had been ordered and when what remained to be done required the exercise of engineering skill and knowledge. Under such circumstances it could not be said that he had substantially completed his contract. Appelby v. Myers L.R. 2 C.P. 651; Sumpter v. Hedges [1898] 1 Q.B. 673 at 674; Dakin v. Lee [1916] 1 K.B. 566, applied.\nDecision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario [1951] O.R. 860, reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of Genest J. at the trial dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action and awarding judgment to the defendant on his counterclaim.\nW.B. Williston for the appellant.\nJ.D. Arnup, Q.C. and J.S. Boeckh for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The appellant is a manufacturer of soap and the respondent is a mechanical engineer. This action arises out of an agreement between the parties for the construction by the respondent in the plant of the appellant of a machine for making and drying soap chips. There is also a claim made by the respondent for $1,000 for the \u201cinstallation\u201d of the machine in question and of certain pulleys, hangers and shafting to be supplied by the appellant which requires consideration but it will be convenient first to dispose of the questions relating to the contract for the construction of the machine itself. It was a term of the contract that the type of design of the machine and the products produced by it should be \u201cof the standard generally used and produced by all the large soap producers on this continent.\u201d It is now common ground that this was an entire contract to construct the machine for a price of $9,800 payable $4,000 in cash on completion and the balance to be secured by promissory notes. For the reasons given by Roach J.A. I agree with his conclusion, which was also that of the learned trial judge, that the contract was not one for the sale of goods but for work to be done and materials supplied.\nThe contract was made in September 1945. No date for completion was fixed. For reasons with which we are not now concerned there were numerous and lengthy delays in building the machine. By March 1, 1949, according to the evidence of the respondent, the work had progressed to a point where the supplying of a small number of parts and the performance of a few days work would have resulted in the completion of the machine. At this point the respondent took the position that he would do nothing more unless and until he was paid $3,000, which, added to $1,000 which had been paid to him in November 1946, would make up the payment of $4,000 which was due on completion. The explanation of this given by the respondent at the trial was that he was afraid that if he completed the machine so that the appellant no longer required his services in connection with it he would not be paid. The appellant offered to deposit the sum mentioned in escrow to be paid to the respondent on completion of the machine but the respondent refused to proceed unless payment was made to him. By letter dated March 25, 1949 the appellant required the respondent to complete his contract by April 30, 1949 stating in part that unless he did so:\u2014\n\u2026 we shall cancel the contract and require you to remove this machine from our premises, and request you to return the $1,000 paid to you, and further reimburse us for the time our employees worked on this machine with your employees, at your request, and for materials supplied at your request.\nThe letter concluded with the following paragraph:\u2014\nIf for any reason the time limit fixed by us for completion of the machine is unreasonable or insufficient, we would ask you to kindly advise us at once, otherwise we shall presume that we have given you reasonable time for so doing, and will act accordingly.\nCounsel for the respondent does not suggest that the date fixed by this letter for completion was unreasonable. His submission is that the contract was already substantially completed. The respondent did nothing further and on May 11, 1949 the appellant commenced this action. The Statement of Claim recites the contract, alleges that the machine had never been constructed or completed and claims:\u2014\n(a) A declaration of this court that the contract between the parties hereto and dated the 21st of September, 1945, has been cancelled,\n(b) The sum of $1,000 paid to the defendant.\n(c) The sum of $700, value of floor space in the plaintiff\u2019s factory, used by the defendant.\n(d) The sum of $137.11 the value of materials supplied by the plaintiff to the defendant at his request. (e) The sum of $355.77 being value of materials purchased by the plaintiff as aforesaid less their salvage values and wasted by reason of the failure of the defendant to complete such machine.\nAt the opening of the trial the following claim was added by amendment, (e) (1) the sum of $1,191.80 the cost of labour referred to in paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim. The relevant sentence in paragraph 9 is as follows:\nThe plaintiff further supplied labour at the request of the defendant in the construction of such machine, such labour costing the plaintiff the sum of $1,191.80.\nThere was an alternative claim for $15,000 damages, presumably to cover the contingency of its being held that the appellant had to accept and pay for the machine.\nParagraph 5 of the Statement of Defence reads as follows:\u2014\nThe defendant says and the fact is that he has manufactured upon the premises of the plaintiff a machine as specified in the said agreement referred to in paragraph 3 of the statement of claim and that the plaintiff is now obliged to accept and pay for the same.\nThe respondent asked that the action be dismissed and counterclaimed (a) $9,584 being the contract price of $9,800 plus $784 sales tax less $1,000 paid on account, (b) $1,000 for \u201cinstallation\u201d as mentioned above and (c) $500 paid by the respondent for labour which he claimed should have been supplied by the appellant.\nThe learned trial judge held that \u201cthere was a substantial compliance with the contract\u201d by the respondent, that there was no abandonment of the work by him, and no total failure of consideration, and that the respondent was entitled to be paid the contract price \u201cless the cost of completing the machine, etc. and putting it in working order,\u201d which last mentioned cost he fixed at $600. He allowed the respondent\u2019s claim on the separate contract at $1,000 and on his claim of $500 he allowed him $200. Judgment was accordingly given for the respondent on his counterclaim for these amounts totalling $10,184, with costs, and the action was dismissed with costs. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal and the plaintiff now appeals to this Court.\nI did not understand counsel to differ as to the present state of the law in Ontario but rather as to its application to the facts of the case at bar. In Appleby v. Myers[2], a decision of the Exchequer Chamber in which the unanimous judgment of the Court, Martin B., Blackburn J., Bramwell B., Shee and Lush JJ., was delivered by Blackburn J., that learned judge stated the general rule at page 661, as follows:\u2014\n... the plaintiffs, having contracted to do an entire work for a specific sum, can recover nothing unless the work be done, or it can be shown that it was the defendant\u2019s fault that the work was incomplete, or that there is something to justify the conclusion that the parties have entered into a fresh contract.\nThe judgment in Appleby v. Myers was approved and acted upon by the Judicial Committee in Forman & Co. Proprietary Ltd. v. The Ship \u201cLiddesdale\u201d[3], particularly at page 202. In Sumpter v. Hedges[4], A.L. Smith L.J. said:\u2014\nThe law is that, where there is a contract to do work for a lump sum, until the work is completed the price of it cannot be recovered.\nThis rule was recognized by the Court of Appeal in H. Dakin and Co. Ltd. v. Lee[5], but it was pointed out that the word \u201ccompleted\u201d as used in the rule is, in certain circumstances, equivalent to \u201csubstantially completed\u201d. The judgments in Dakin v. Lee have been repeatedly approved and followed in Ontario, vide e.g. Taylor Hardware Co. v. Hunt[6], and in my respectful opinion they correctly state the law.\nThe real question on this appeal is whether the respondent substantially completed his contract to construct the machine. With the greatest respect for the contrary view held by the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal, I have reached the conclusion that he did not. From a perusal of the written record I would have inclined to the view that the evidence of the appellant\u2019s expert witness Mitchell, who was of opinion that the machine when completed would not be capable of producing soap chips of commercial quality should be preferred to that of the experts called by the respondent not only because of his admittedly high qualifications but because he appeared to have based his opinion on a much more thorough examination of the machine than was made by the other witnesses; but I do not rest my judgment on this view. In my opinion on the evidence of the respondent himself and of the witnesses called on his behalf there was no substantial completion of the contract. At the time when the respondent definitely refused to proceed further with the construction of the machine it was incomplete in the following respects: the \u201cknife\u201d and \u201cflange\u201d were missing, baffles were required for the canvas apron screening of the dryer, further work was required on the fans and the speed of the machine had to be changed, being about six times as fast as was proper. It is urged on behalf of the respondent that these are comparatively unimportant details and that the allowance of $600 for the completion of the machine made by the learned trial judge is a generous one. But it appears from the evidence of the respondent and his witnesses that what remained to be done required engineering skill and knowledge. The record is silent as to whether the services of an engineer other than the respondent possessing the necessary skills were available to the appellant. The situation was, I think, accurately summed up in the following answer made in re-examination by the expert witness Stokes called for the respondent:\u2014\nI think I know what both you gentlemen are trying to get at, and let me put it this way, it may not be legal or it may not be orthodox, but I am going to say this, if Fairbanks and Sheppard do not get together that machine will never run, it has to depend on the co\u2011operation of two individuals just the same as ours at Guelph. If we had sat on the sidelines looking at it, it would never run. We had to co-operate with Sheppard and he had to co-operate with us. Everyone has to co-operate to operate the machine.\nThe respondent in his own evidence makes it clear that he decided to desist from further construction at a time when the machine was not capable of producing soap chips and to refuse to bring it to the state where it would produce them unless and until he was paid moneys to which under the contract he was not then entitled. He says in effect that he had intentionally put in sprockets of the wrong size so that the appellant could not use the machine to produce chips. After stating that one reason for putting in a small sprocket was to \u201crun the machine in\u201d he added that he had another reason. He was questioned as to this by the learned trial judge as follows:\u2014\nHis Lordship: You asked him what reason and he is not finished his answer. A. Will I give the other reason?\nQ. Yes. A. Because of the fact if I had gone and put the proper speeds on that dryer and I had put the knife on the dryer and operated that dryer producing chips, from my previous experience about the loan on the machine, with my dealings with Mr. Fairbanks with the machine, I had come to the firm conclusion I would have been locked out of the plant the same as Arneil, I would have been locked out and I would have had to sue him for my money. He could have fooled around for years and been making soap chips at my expense. I have $6,000 tied up in the machine and I think I have a right to get something out of it before I operate it and he could go on and operate it for years.\nI can find nothing in Dakin v. Lee (supra) or in the numerous other authorities referred to by counsel to indicate that under all these circumstances it could be said that the respondent had substantially completed his contract. The contract was to construct a machine to produce soap chips of a certain standard. The respondent refused to do anything further at a time when on his own evidence the partially constructed machine would not produce soap chips at all. In my opinion on the view of the evidence most favourable to the respondent he abandoned the work and left it unfinished. The difference between the facts of the case at bar and those in Dakin v. Lee (supra) are apparent on reading all the judgments in the last mentioned case, and it will be sufficient to refer to the following passage from the judgment of Lord Cozens-Hardy M.R. at pages 578 and 579:\u2014\nIn these circumstances it has been argued before us that, in a contract of this kind to do work for a lump sum, the defect in some of the items in the specification, or the failure to do every item contained in the specification, puts an end to the whole contract, and prevents the builders from making any claim upon it; and therefore, where there is no ground for presuming any fresh contract, he cannot obtain any payment. The matter has been treated in the argument as though the omission to do every item perfectly was an abandonment of the contract. That seems to me, with great respect, to be absolutely and entirely wrong. An illustration of the abandonment of a contract which was given from one of the authorities was that of a builder who, when he had half finished his work, said to the employer \u201cI cannot finish it, because I have no money,\u201d and left the job undone at that stage. That is an abandonment of the contract, and prevents the builder, therefore, from making any claim, unless there be some other circumstances leading to a different conclusion. But to say that a builder cannot recover from a building owner merely because some item of the work has been done negligently or inefficiently or improperly is a proposition which I should not listen to unless compelled by a decision of the House of Lords. Take a contract for a lump sum to decorate a house; the contract provides that there shall be three coats of oil paint, but in one of the rooms only two coats of paint are put on. Can anybody seriously say that under these circumstances the building owner could go and occupy the house and take the benefit of all the decorations which had been done in the other rooms without paying a penny for all the work done by the builder, just because only two coats of paint had been put on in one room where there ought to have been three?\nI regard the present case as one of negligence and bad workmanship, and not as a case where there has been an omission of any one of the items in the specification. The builders thought apparently, or so they have sworn, that they had done all that was intended to be done in reference to the contract; and I suppose the defects are due to carelessness on the part of some of the workmen or of the foreman: but the existence of these defects does not amount to a refusal by them to perform part of the contract; it simply shows negligence in the way in which they have done the work.\nIn the case at bar when the respondent knew the machine was not capable of producing soap chips he said to the appellant: \u201cI will not finish it unless you pay me $3,000.\u201d In my opinion the conduct of the respondent falls within the illustration of an abandonment of a contract given by the Master of the Rolls in the above quoted passage.\nCounsel for the respondent did not seek to base any claim in regard to this contract on a quantum meruit and I think it clear that, if, as I have held to be the case, there was no substantial completion of the contract, there was no evidence from which any new contract to accept and pay for the work done could be inferred. From the evidence it seems probable that the machine in its present state has become part of the realty which belongs to the appellant. Assuming this to be so it is clear from the reasons in Sumpter v. Hedges[7] that the mere fact of the appellant remaining in possession of his land is no evidence upon which an inference of a new contract can be founded. At page 676 Collins L.J. puts the matter as follows:\u2014\nThere are cases in which, though the plaintiff has abandoned the performance of a contract, it is possible for him to raise the inference of a new contract to pay for the work done on a quantum meruit from the defendant\u2019s having taken the benefit of that work, but, in order that that may be done, the circumstances must be such as to give an option to the defendant to take or not to take the benefit of the work done. It is only where the circumstances are such as to give that option that there is any evidence on which to ground the inference of a new contract.\nIn the case at bar the appellant has never elected to take any benefit available to him from the unfinished work and Mr. Williston stated that he was willing that, in the event of his appeal succeeding, a term should be inserted in the judgment permitting the respondent to remove the machine within a reasonable time. For the above reasons I am of opinion that the respondent\u2019s claim based on the contract to construct the machine fails and that the appellant is entitled to a declaration that the contract was cancelled and to the return of the $1,000 paid to the respondent in November 1946.\nIt is next necessary to consider the appellant\u2019s claim for damages. The amount to which the appellant should be held entitled was not argued before us and the best course might be to direct a reference but in the hope of bringing the litigation to an end I have examined the evidence and have concluded that substantial justice would be done by awarding the appellant the total of items (d), (e) and (e) (1) claimed in the Statement of Claim amounting to $1,684.68, but as this branch of the matter was not fully argued before us, either party dissatisfied with this amount may have a reference at his own risk as to costs to the Master at Toronto to determine the amount.\nIt remains to consider the item of $1,000, claimed by the respondent for \u201cinstallation\u201d, referred to in the opening paragraph of these reasons. This item is claimed in paragraph 2 of the counterclaim which reads as follows:\u2014\nThe defendant further says that the installation of the said machine and accessories thereto was on the basis of a separate order from the plaintiff to the defendant for which the defendant was to be separately paid and in respect of which the defendant is entitled to the sum of $1,000. The plaintiff further agreed to supply labour to assist the defendant in the installation of the said machine and failed to do so, as a result whereof the defendant had to hire extra labour and incurred expenditures in the sum of approximately $500.\nIn so far as these claims are for the installation of the machine they must fail. Having refused to complete the construction of the machine I can find no basis for a claim to be paid for the installation of an incomplete machine which must now be removed. There was however a separate agreement to be found in the letters marked as Exhibits 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 and 32 to install a motor and certain pulleys and hangers to be used on the ceiling counter shafts for driving the dryer. Exhibit 32, a letter from the respondent to the appellant, reads as follows:\u2014\nWe acknowledge your letter of September 26th, authorizing us to proceed with the erection of pulleys, hangers and motor for the driving members to the various sections of the dryer.\nWe as arranged are to supply the labour and engineering in connection with the same but not materials, and for the sake of record and invoicing wish to point out that this is a separate order from the dryer proper and will be billed to you on that basis. There is no evidence of any bill having been rendered by the respondent shewing what part of the $1,000 claimed in paragraph 2 of the counterclaim is attributable to the installation of these items and I am unable to find much assistance in the evidence. It does appear however that the work was done and the exhibits referred to indicate the amount of material installed. While I feel it is little better than a guess, I would, once more in the hope of bringing the litigation to an end, assess the amount to which the respondent is entitled for installing the equipment in question at $200 with a similar right to either party, if dissatisfied with this figure, to have a reference to the Master at Toronto.\nIn the result the appeal should be allowed and judgment should be entered (a) declaring that the contract between the parties dated the 21st of September 1945 has been cancelled, (b) providing that the appellant recover from the respondent the sum of $2,684.68, (c) providing that the respondent shall have the right to remove the incomplete machine from the premises of the appellant within sixty days from the date of the delivery of this judgment, (d) providing that the respondent recover from the appellant on his counterclaim the sum of $200; provided however that if either party so elects within fifteen days of the date of the delivery of this judgment in respect of either or both of items (b) and (d) above, instead of judgment being entered for the amount above set out it shall be referred to the Master at Toronto to determine the amount of damages in respect of the item or items as to which such election is made.\nAs the appellant has succeeded substantially both on the claim and counterclaim it should have its costs of the action and counterclaim and of the appeals to the Court of Appeal and to this Court.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fasken, Robertson, Aitchison, Pickup & Calvin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Mason, Foulds, Arnup, Walter & Weir.\n[1] [1951] O.R. 860.\n[2] (1867) L.R. 2 C.P. 651.\n[3] [1900] A.C. 190.\n[4] [1898] 1 Q.B. 673 at 674.\n[5] [1916] 1 K.B. 566.\n[6] (1917) 39 O.L.R. 85 at 88.\n[7] [1898] 1 Q.B. 673.\n"}

Desharnais and The Pacific Cartage & Storage Company Limited (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nMuriel Johnson (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1952: November 10; 1953: March 18.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Estey, Locke and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OP ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nNegligence\u2014Motor Vehicle\u2014Pedestrian run down in intersection\u2014Driver's vision obscured by frosted windshield\u2014Whether if pedestrian not in pedestrian crossing, onus on driver discharged\u2014The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 275, ss. 69 (2), (4), 94(1).\nIn an action for damages against the appellants for injuries suffered by the respondent, who was knocked down at a street intersection and run over by a motor truck driven by the appellant driver and owned by the appellant company, the defences pleaded were negligence by the respondent in crossing the intersection diagonally and her failure, contrary to s. 59(4) of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 275, to yield the right-of-way to the vehicle, and in the alternative, contributory negligence. The evidence was that the driver's vision was obscured by frost on the windshield which prevented his seeing the respondent. No one saw the collision but from the evidence adduced the trial judge considered that it had occurred, either while the respondent was crossing from the northeast to the northwest corner of the intersection and while she was in the pedestrian right-of-way or, after she angled off that right-of-way slightly in a southwesterly direction. He found the latter to be the case but that that was not a contributing cause of the accident, and that the entire fault was the negligence of the truck driver. The judgment was affirmed by Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division, Frank Ford J.A. dissenting.\nHeld: (Locke J. dissenting), that the appeal should be dismissed. Upon the evidence the accident was caused by the negligence of the driver of the truck and there was no negligence on the part of the rspondent contributing to the accident.\nPer: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin J.:\u2014It made no difference whether the respondent followed the unmarked crossing, or whether she deviated \"very slightly\" therefrom as the trial judge found, or even if she crossed at a point further to the south and near the centre of the intersection, as the majority of the Court of Appeal thought, in any event, the position of the respondent had nothing to do with the accident.\nThe respondent stated she looked to her left, where the traffic nearest her would be expected. As a result of the accident she remembered nothing further but that did not necessarily mean that she did not thereafter look to her right, and there was nothing to indicate that the truck would have been seen at any relevant period in sufficient time for the respondent to avoid the accident. Nance v. British Columbia Electric Ry. Ld. [1951] A.C. 601 at 609. In view of the finding that the position of the respondent was not a contributory cause of the accident, the onus section, s. 94(1), need not be considered.\nPer: Estey and Fauteux JJ.:\u2014There was no evidence accepted by the trial judge that justified a finding that the respondent was not upon the pedestrian lane when struck by the appellants' truck. Therefore, the case fell within s. 59(2) by virtue of which the operator of the vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to the pedestrian. There was no evidence as to the manner in which the respondent conducted herself and, therefore, no evidence that she failed to exercise due care.\nPer: Locke J. (dissenting):\u2014The evidence disclosed that the respondent proceeded across the intersection diagonally from the northeast corner toward the southwest corner and was to the west of the centre of the intersection when struck by the truck. In failing to concede the right-of-way given to the oncoming vehicle by s. 59(4), and in failing to take any precautions for her own safety, her negligence contributed to the accident. Swartz v. Wills [1935] S.C.R. 628. The statement in the reasons for judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal that the evidence must prove beyond a doubt to the satisfaction of the jury that the pedestrian did by negligence contribute to the accident was error. The evidence in the case discharged the onus placed upon the appellants by s. 94(1). Both the driver and the respondent were guilty of negligence contributing to the accident, as found by Frank Ford J.A., and the liability should have been apportioned equally.

L. Fenerty, Q.C. for the appellants.\nM. Millard, Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by:\u2014\nKerwin J.:\u2014Several errors were pointed out in the reasons for judgment of the trial judge and in the reasons in the Court of Appeal but, irrespective of any onus under s. 94(1) of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act of Alberta, R.S.A. 1942, c. 275, the evidence satisfies me, as it did the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal, that the accident was caused by the negligence of the driver of the truck and that there was no negligence on the part of the respondent contributing to the accident. In my opinion it makes no difference whether she followed the unmarked crossing, or whether she deviated \"very slightly\" therefrom as the trial judge found, or even if she crossed at a point further to the south and nearer the centre of the inter-section as the majority of the Court of Appeal thought. On this point I am inclined to agree with the trial judge but, in any event, the position of the respondent had nothing to do with the accident. The truck driver was driving a truck in which his vision to the left was obscured by reason of frost on the windshield; he proceeded at the same rate of speed down the street and across a busy intersection, failed to see the respondent, and his truck struck her.\nCentre Street in the City of Calgary runs north and south, and 20th Avenue runs east and west. The respondent had in her hands letters for mailing and she intended to cross from the northeast to the northwest corner of the intersection of these highways in order to deposit the letters in a mail box situated on the northwest corner. Neither highway is a stop street and there are no traffic lights. The respondent stated that before starting to cross, she looked to her left, that is, to the south where the traffic nearest her would be expeced. As a result of the accident she remembers nothing further but that does not necessarily mean that she did not thereafter look to her right. In Nance v. British Columbia Electric Railway Ld. 2, a pedestrian had been instantly killed by a street car and in the British Columbia Court of Appeal, Chief Justice Sloan had said:\u2014\"Had he taken the precaution of a momentary glance, he would not have walked into a position of imminent peril.\" Viscount Simon, speaking for the Judicial Committee, stated at page 609 with reference to this statement:\u2014\"On this, their Lordships would respectfully observe that in their opinion there was no evidence that the deceased did not look, and that if he looked, it may be that he saw that the car was stationary.\" Furthermore, in view of the down grade of Centre Street to the north at some point north of the intersection, and accepting the truck driver's evidence as to his rate of speed, fifteen to twenty miles per hour, there is nothing to indicate that the truck would have been seen at any relevant period in sufficient time for the respondent to avoid the collision.\nOn my view of the matter, s. 6 of The Contributory Negligence Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 116, and the question of ultimate negligence need not be considered. Section 6 provides:\u2014\nWhere the trial is before a judge without a jury the judge shall not take into consideration any question as to whether, notwithstanding the fault of one party, the other could have avoided the consequences thereof unless he is satisfied by the evidence that the act or omission of the latter was clearly subsequent to and severable from the act or omission of the former so as not to be substantially contemporaneous therewith.\nI might add that in my opinion the Court of Appeal were in error in attaching as much importance as they did to the positions occupied after the collision by the various articles that had been in the respondent's hands. In view of the tendency of these articles to be scattered after an event such as that with which we are concerned, nothing may be inferred from where they were found as to where the accident occurred. The evidence of the witness Craven has not been overlooked but in view of the findings of the trial judge it must not have been accepted by him, and a reading of the transcript appears to justify his disregard of it.\nThe appellants relied upon s. 59(4) of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act:\u2014\nEvery pedestrian crossing a roadway at any point other than within a marked or unmarked crossing shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles and street railway cars upon the roadway, provided that this provision shall not relieve the driver of a vehicle or street railway car from the duty of exercising due care for the safety of pedestrians.\nIt was argued that if it be shown that the respondent was off the pedestrian crossing, she must yield the right-of-way to vehicular traffic; that her failure to do so contributed to the accident; and that this satisfies the onus resting on the truck driver of proving that the accident was not entirely or solely due to his fault as provided by s. 94(1):\u2014\nWhen any loss or damage is sustained or incurred by any person by reason of a motor vehicle in motion, the onus of proof that the loss or damage did not entirely or solely arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of the motor vehicle shall be upon the owner or driver of the motor vehicle. Even if the respondent had not been on the pedestrian crossing, I agree with Mr. Justice Clinton J. Ford, speaking for the majority of the Court of Appeal, that this has nothing to do with the matter unless it be found that it was a contributory cause of the accident.\nFor the reasons already indicated, I think the onus section, s. 94(1), need not be considered but our attention was called to an extract from the judgment of Mr. Justice Clinton J. Ford where, after disposing of the appellants' contention now under consideration, he continues:\u2014\nThe answer might also be stated in this way: The evidence, including any fair inference therefrom, must prove beyond a doubt to the satisfaction of the jury that the pedestrian did by negligence contribute to the accident, and until this has been done the onus still remains on the driver. Geel v. Winnipeg Electric Co. 3.\nObjection was raised, and I think properly so, to the words \"beyond a doubt\" but I venture to think that their insertion was inadvertent. The Geel case was concerned with a section of the Manitoba Motor Vehicles Act which as it then stood may be taken for present purposes to be the same as s. 94(1) of the Alberta Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act except that the words \"entirely or solely\" did not appear. In the judgment of Lord Wright delivered on behalf of the Judicial Committee it was stated:\u2014\"if, however, the issue is left in doubt or the evidence is balanced and even, the defendant will be held liable in virtue of the statutory onus\" and in concluding he put it thus:\u2014\"No doubt the question of onus need not be considered, if at the end of the case the tribunal can come to a clear conclusion one way or the other, but it must remain to the end the determining factor unless the issue of negligence is cleared up beyond doubt to the satisfaction of the jury\". The meaning of \"doubt\" in these two extracts is clear. Lord Wright was not dealing with doubt or reasonable doubt as used in criminal cases and I am quite sure that Mr. Justice Clinton J. Ford meant nothing more than Lord Wright although unfortunately in the former's reasons in this case the letter \"a\" was inserted between \"beyond\" and \"doubt\". The matter is mentioned merely because of the significance attached to it by counsel for the appellants. The trial judge directed that the respondent should have costs \"on triple column 5\" but the Court of Appeal could find no reason to increase the usual scale allowable under the rules. A litigant has no more right to cross-appeal than to enter a substantive appeal on a question of costs only and, in any event, I would not interfere with the order made by the Court of Appeal.\nThe appellants did not question the amount of the damages awarded and the appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs and the cross-appeal without costs.\nThe judgment of Estey and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nEstey J.:\u2014At trial the respondent was awarded damages for injuries suffered when struck by appellant company's one-and-one-half ton truck driven by its employee, appellant Desharnais, at the intersection of Centre Street and 20th Avenue in the City of Calgary on Monday, October 25, 19p48, at 7:30 a.m. The majority of the learned judges in the Appellate Division affirmed this judgment at trial. Mr. Justice Frank Ford, dissenting in part, would have held the negligence of both parties contributed, and apportioned the fault two-thirds against the appellant and one-third against the respondent.\nIt was a clear, cold, frosty morning. Appellant Desharnais had left the truck outdoors all night and the windshield was covered with frost. He removed some, but an examination of the windshield disclosed that sufficient had not been removed to make driving reasonably safe. Moreover, Desharnais deposed that as he approached the intersection the sun blinded him. Notwithstanding these two factors, he continued driving at his speed of fifteen to twenty miles per hour as he entered the intersection.\nWhen about one-quarter of a block north from the intersection he deposed that he saw a young lady crossing the intersection at an angle toward the southwest corner. As he noticed her she was not quite half way across. He \"kind of watched her\" and \"figured she was all of the way across the street.\" He then \"lost vision of her.\" When he realized that his truck had struck a young lady, he thought it was the same one, who had turned around and was walking back toward the northeast corner. No evidence was adduced to support this surmise and, on the contrary, Miss Halpin, who worked for the same company as the respondent, had just crossed from the northeast corner and had reached Campbell's car at the southwest corner when she heard a noise and, turning, she saw the respondent under the truck. I am in agreement with the majority of the learned judges in the Appellate Court that Desharnais had seen Miss Halpin and, as he admits that he had seen no other young lady, he never did see the appellant. This conclusion is in accord with the remarks which he made immediately following the collision when he asked: \"Where did she come from?\"\nThe learned trial judge and all of the judges in the Appellate Division have, upon the evidence, held that the appellant Desharnais was negligent in a manner that contributed to the collision and the record amply supports that conclusion.\nThe appellants submit that the respondent, by her own negligence, contributed to her injury. The learned trial judge stated:\nOn the evidence produced, I find that the plaintiff did angle very slightly from the pedestrian right-of-way between the northeast and northwest corners, but I cannot find that that was a contributing cause of the accident.\nThe Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act (R.S.A. 1942, c. 275) contains two relevant provisions, s. 59(2) and 59(4). These provide that at an intersection such as that here in question the operator of a vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to a pedestrian crossing the roadway upon or within any crossing at an intersection, while a pedestrian crossing at any point other than within the marked or unmarked crossing shall yield the right-of-way to the operator of the vehicle. In neither case is the driver or the pedestrian excused from a duty to exercise due care. In view of these statutory provisions it is material to determine, if possible, where the respondent was at the moment of impact.\nCraven, who was walking across 20th Avenue from the southwest toward the northwest corner, while he did not see the collision, did see the respondent who, as he deposed, was angling across the intersection toward a point that would be about one-quarter of the distance from the south- west to the northwest corner on the west side of Centre Street. I am in agreement with the learned judges of the Appellate Division that the learned trial judge, in finding \"the plaintiff (resp.) did angle very slightly,\" either discounted or disbelieved the evidence of Craven.\nCampbell, who worked for the same company as respondent and Miss Halpin, conveyed them in his automobile, along with others, to their work each morning. Respondent and Miss Halpin met him at the southwest corner of this intersection. Miss Halpin, upon this occasion, when at the northeast corner saw respondent coming down Centre Street on the east side, but, observing that respondent was carrying some letters that presumably she would mail at the northwest corner, did not wait for her, but proceeded toward Campbell's car then approaching the southwest corner from the west on 20th Avenue.\nThe respondent deposed that she had come down Centre Street on the east side with letters she intended to mail at the northwest corner; that at the northeast corner she turned and started across to mail the letters at the northwest corner, looking to the south for oncoming traffic. She remembers nothing as to the events that followed, except \"yelling, 'My arm hurts, take me home,' \" but she cannot say where she was at that time. The next thing she remembers is waking up in the hospital some hours later. The doctor said \"she was responding a little from 24 to 36 hours.\" If her evidence is accepted it is a fair conclusion that she was walking on the pedestrian lane on the north side of 20th Avenue crossing Centre Street.\nThe letters, respondent's purse and the contents thereof were found scattered in, or near, the southwest quarter of the intersection. No person states precisely where these were found, except Miss Halpin does say that the broken glasses were picked up \"in the cross-walk from the north to the south side of 20th Avenue on the west side of Centre Street\" about half way.\nNo person saw the collision, nor did anyone see the truck at any time touch her body. Four saw her upon the street immediately after the accident. One deposed she was rolling under the front part of the truck, another between the front and the back wheels, a third that she was lying between the wheels of the truck and the fourth that she was behind the truck, which was still proceeding, however, within the intersection. All agreed that the truck passed over her. It is important to observe that she suffered severe injury about her head, arms and legs, including a fractured skull and forearm. Her clothes were torn and sand and gravel impressed both in her lacerations and her clothes. These facts make it clear that those who saw the respondent under the truck did not see the manner in which she must have been thrown about, if, indeed, not dragged some distance, in order that such injuries might be inflicted.\nThe appellant Desharnais deposed as follows:\nI kind of shielded my eyes from the glare of the sun, and the next thing I knew there was a big thump like a bump and I looked back in the rear view window or mirror and I could not see anything, in the rear view window, and I went a few feet further and I looked again and I seen a young lady laying on the road. I immediately stopped and got out and went over to her.\nThen he deposed:\nQ. The sun did not bother you at any other point along Centre Street except when you got to the intersection of 20th Avenue?\nA. That is right, sir.\nQ. That is the only place it bothered you?\nA. That is right, sir.\nHe was of the opinion that the respondent had somehow come in contact with the side of the truck and that the right rear dual wheel passed over her when he was about the middle of the intersection. Although no other witness saw the wheels pass over her, some such occurrence may well have happened. The front of the truck was carefully examined. There was no mark that would indicate a point of impact. This, of course, having regard to the manner in which the front of the truck was constructed, is not significant. The learned judges of the Appellate Division were of the opinion, with which I respectfully agree, that, having regard to all the circumstances, the probability is that she was struck by the front of the truck.\nCentre Street and 20th Avenue are each 42 feet wide between the curb lines. The truck was being driven at from 15 to 20 miles per hour, or approximately 22\u00bd to 30 feet per second. Appellant Desharnais would, therefore, proceed straight through the intersection, as he said he did, in less than 1\u00bd to 2 seconds. There is no suggestion that he applied his brakes until after he had passed over the respondent and stopped his truck about 40 to 50 feet south of the intersection.\nIt is often difficult to determine just how such collisions occur and in what manner the injuries are inflicted. This is no exception. Moreover, experience indicates that conclusions based upon the position of articles scattered about, that were in the possession of an injured party, are often unreliable. The significant factors are that no person saw the truck strike respondent, or, indeed, at any time touch her. Her injuries were extensive and the major portion must have been suffered before anyone saw her under the truck and, therefore, further north in the intersection than where the witnesses first saw her under the truck. Then, having regard to the width of the intersection (42 feet) and the speed of the truck, together with the fact that the appellant never saw the respondent until he had looked the second time, after realizing something had happened, supports a conclusion that this collision occurred at least well to the north of the intersection.\nThe learned trial judge stated:\nThe plaintiff then attempted to cross Centre Street to reach Campbell's car and it was then she was struck by the defendant's car and injured. In attempting to reach Campbell's car, she probably did one of two things, either she went towards the northwest corner on the pedestrian right-of-way until she was struck or she angled off that right-of-way very slightly in a southwesterly direction and was there struck.\nThe learned judge would appear not to have given sufficient weight to the positive evidence of the respondent that she was then crossing Centre Street on her way to mail the letters and thereafter would proceed to Campbell's car.\nWhen Craven's evidence is discounted or disbelieved, there is no direct evidence as to respondent's position, except her own, which would place her within the pedestrian lane. With great respect to those who have concluded otherwise, I am of the opinion that there is no evidence accepted by the learned trial judge that justifies a finding that the respondent was not upon the pedestrian lane when struck by the appellant's truck. Therefore, the case falls within s. 59(2), by virtue of which the operator of a vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to a pedestrian. Respondent was, quite apart from any statutory provision, required to exercise due care as she proceeded to cross the intersection. There is, however, no evidence as to the manner in which she conducted herself and, therefore, no evidence that she had failed to exercise due care.\nThe evidence here adduced supports the conclusion that it was the negligence of the appellant Desharnais driving the appellant company's truck that was the sole direct cause of the respondent's injuries.\nI agree with the majority of the learned judges in the Appellate Division that no basis is disclosed which would support the exercise of a judicial discretion to increase the usual scale of costs and I, therefore, agree that the costs at trial should be taxed under Column 5 on the old scale in effect when the action was tried.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs and the cross-appeal without costs.\nLocke, J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta dismissing the appeal of the present appellants from a judgment for damages, for personal injuries awarded against them at the trial by the late Chief Justice Howson of the Supreme Court of Alberta. Frank Ford J.A. disagreed with the judgment of the majority of the Appellate Division and would have apportioned the damages between the parties under the provisions of The Contributory Negligence Act (R.S.A. 1942, c. 116).\nThe respondent is a stenographer in the employ of the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company Limited at Calgary and was at about 7.30 o'clock on the morning of October 25, 1948, crossing the intersection of 20th Avenue and Centre Street in that city when she was knocked down and seriously injured by a truck, the property of the appellant company, and driven by the appellant Desharnais in the course of his employment. Miss Johnson who lived not far distant left her home on the morning in question to proceed to work, walking south along the east side of Centre Street. Centre Street runs north and south and is intersected at right angles by 20th Avenue and it was her intention to proceed to the southwest corner of this intersection to meet Mr. J. M. Campbell, a fellow employee, who was in the custom of driving Miss Johnson and other employees to their work at the plant some ten miles distant. There was at the time a letter box on the northwest corner of the intersection and, according to Miss Johnson, she intended to mail some letters which she was carrying in her hand in this box. A Miss Halpin, a friend employed by the same employer, had preceded her along Centre Street and crossed the intersection ahead of her. Owing to the severity of the injuries sustained in the accident, the respondent unfortunately did not remember anything that occurred after she commenced to cross. However, she recollected what she had done up to that moment and gave the following answers to questions directed to her on her direct examination at the trial:\u2014\nQ. Now, we would like to know what you remember of that accident, what happened that day, what you remember happened that day?\nA. I remember starting to cross the street, to cross from the northeast corner of Centre Street and 20th Avenue, to go across to the west side.\nQ. Why were you going over to the west side?\nA. Because I was going to mail some letters, and then I had to go across 20th Avenue to get my ride to work.\n* * *\nQ. Where did you come from to get to the corner?\nA. Straight up Centre Street from the north.\nQ. You came from the north along Centre Street?\nA. From 27th Avenue south to 20th Avenue.\nQ. You walked down from 27th Avenue to 20th Avenue?\nA. Yes.\n* * *\nQ. And did you see Miss Halpin that morning?\nA. I remember seeing Viola before I got to the corner, but she did not wait for me.\nQ. Viola Halpin?\nA. Viola Halpin, yes.\nQ. And you remember seeing her ahead of you at the corner?\nA. She came to the corner before I did, but she did not stop and wait for me to cross over.\n* * *\nQ. Do you remember seeing her on that corner?\nA. Yes, I remember seeing her there.\n* * *\nQ. What did she do?\nA. She went on across the street.\nQ. What did you do?\nA. I came on up to the corner and then I crossed, started to cross.\nQ. You started to cross?\nA. Yes. Q. Do you know whether you looked for traffic before you started to cross?\nA. I would say I did.\nQ. Well, what did you do before you started to cross?\nA. Before I started to cross the corner, I looked towards 16th Avenue, which is south.\nQ. Yes? Because traffic would be going north on the side of the street?\nA. That is right.\nQ. You remember doing that?\nA. Yes, sir, I remember that.\nQ. And how far did you proceed, as far as your memory carries you?\nA. I don't know, sir.\nQ. You don't know?\nA. No. I remember starting across Centre Street but I don't know how far I ever got.\nCampbell's car was approaching the intersection from the west on 20th Avenue as Miss Johnson reached or was about to reach the northeast corner of the intersection, he intending to stop to pick up his passengers. In cross-examination, further answers were made by the respondent relating to this:\u2014\nQ. Now, as to the accident itself. I think you have told us here today that you recall stepping off the northeast corner with the intention of going directly across to the northwest corner?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. You have told us, I believe, that you have no recollection of what you actually did after stepping off, is that right?\nA. No, I haven't.\nQ. And you have told us that you have actually no recollection as to whether you saw Mr. Campbell's car there or not, you don't know?\nA. No, sir, I don't remember seeing it.\nQ. And you don't know whether you carried out your intention of going straight across, or whether something happened to change your mind, or not, that is a blank, is that right?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. You have also told us that you were in the habit, when you did see Mr. Campbell waiting to hurry to his car, is that right?\nA. Yes.\nQ. You don't know whether you hurried on this occasion or not?\nA. No, sir.\nQ. You don't even know whether his car was there or not?\nA. No, I don't.\nFollowing these answers, the respondent was asked by the learned trial judge whether she remembered what she had done on other occasions prior to this accident at that corner and said that her practice was to go straight across to the northwest corner and then from that corner to the southwest corner, and, in answer to the question:\u2014\n\"You never cut through the middle of the street?\"\nsaid:\u2014\nNo sir, I made a practice of crossing in my own pathway, always had.\nWith respect, I think this evidence was inadmissible. This was, however, followed by the admission that she did not remember what she had done on the morning in question.\nDesharnais was driving south on Centre Street approaching the intersection. The weather was clear and bright but there had been a hoarfrost during the night and the windshield of the respondent company's truck, which had been standing out overnight, had become coated with frost. According to Desharnais, he had scraped the frost off the windshield on the driver's side and to some extent from the right side of the windshield and he was driving with the window on the left door of the truck lowered. Despite this, he did not see Miss Johnson though, according to him, he saw another young woman cross the intersection from the east side of Centre Street. The speed of the truck is not in dispute; it was proceeding at between 20 and 25 miles an hour when it entered the intersection and struck Miss Johnson.\nIn spite of the fact that Campbell, Miss Halpin and the witness Callbeck who was in Campbell's car at the time the accident took place were so close to the scene, none of them saw Miss Johnson as she proceeded across the intersection, the only witness who was able to give evidence as to this being George H. Craven, who lived nearby and who was proceeding from the southwest to the northwest corner of the intersection as the truck approached from the north and Miss Johnson was crossing the street. According to Craven, the respondent was not walking towards the northwest corner of the intersection but appeared to be heading towards the car which was parked on 20th Avenue close to the southwest corner. As Craven was about half way across 20th Avenue, he said that Miss Johnson was almost directly opposite him and the truck was then about to enter the intersection, so that it is apparent that he observed her immediately before the moment of impact. Upon a plan of the intersection this witness indicated the course followed by Miss Johnson as being on a line running slightly west of due southwest from the centre of the curve of the curb at the northeast corner. Craven had apparently not kept his eyes fixed upon the respondent and did not see the actual impact but placed her position as being slightly to the north of the centre line of 20th Avenue and in the traffic lane. In answer to a question directed to him by the learned trial judge, he described her course across the intersection as cutting the corner. The only other evidence as to the point of impact is that to be inferred from the place where her personal belongings were found on the pavement after she had been struck, and as to this I respectfully agree with Mr. Justice Frank Ford that it supports Craven's account as to Miss Johnson's position at the time of impact.\nDesharnais' excuse for not having seen the respondent crossing in full view from his left is that he was dazzled by the rays of the sun. He contends that he had removed sufficient of the hoarfrost from the windshield to enable him to see clearly objects ahead and to his left. In addition, the open window on the left door of the truck gave him added vision to his left. However, it is clear that whether his failure to see Miss Johnson was due to the glare of the sun, or to his vision through the windshield being obscured, or to his failure to look to his left, he was guilty of negligence which contributed to the occurrence of the accident. If his vision was obscured for either of these reasons, it was a negligent act to have approached the crossing at a speed of from 20 to 25 miles an hour. The only question to be determined is whether upon this evidence the respondent should not have been found to have been guilty of negligence contributing to the accident and the damages accordingly apportioned.\nIn determining this question, certain statutory provisions must be considered. Ss. 2 of s. 59 of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act (c. 275, R.S.A. 1942), in so far as relevant, reads:\u2014\nThe operator of a vehicle \u2026 shall yield the right-of-way to a pedestrian crossing the roadway upon or within any crossing at an intersection except at intersections where the movement of traffic is regulated by a police officer or traffic control signal \u2026 This provision shall not relieve the pedestrian from the duty of exercising due care for his safety. S-s. 4 of that section provides that:\u2014\nEvery pedestrian crossing a roadway at any point other than within a marked or unmarked crossing shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles and street railway cars upon the roadway, provided that this provision shall not relieve the driver of a vehicle or street railway car from the duty of exercising due care for the safety of pedestrians.\nS-s. 1 of s. 94 of the same Act deals with the question of onus of proof in these terms:\u2014\nWhen any loss or damage is sustained or incurred by any person by reason of a motor vehicle in motion, the onus of proof that the loss or damage did not entirely or solely arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of the motor vehicle shall be upon the owner or driver of the motor vehicle.\nThere is a concrete sidewalk on either side of Centre Street and a boulevard between the roadway and the sidewalk enclosed by concrete curbing. On each of the four corners of the intersection there is a rounded curb which connects the curbing on Centre Street with that along both sides of 20th Avenue. At the northeast corner the sidewalk extends westerly to connect with the street curb at that point. The sidewalk on the east side of Centre Street appears from the photographs filed to be connected with the street curbing in the same manner as that at the northeast corner. Both avenue and street are forty-two feet in width from curb to curb. There is no marked crossing between the northeast and the northwest corners of the intersection and there was no traffic light.\nIn the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge he said in part:\u2014\nIn attempting to reach Campbell's car she probably did one of two things, either she went toward the northwest corner on the pedestrian right-of-way until she was struck or she angled off that right-of-way very slightly in a southwesterly direction and was there struck. No witness produced can say, because no witness actually saw the collision \u2026 On the evidence produced, I find that the plaintiff did angle very slightly from the pedestrian right-of-way between the northeast and northwest corners, but I cannot find that that was a contributing cause of the accident.\nWhile it is true that Craven did not see the actual impact, it was only an instant before it occurred that he had seen the respondent walking directly into the path of the on-coming truck. Howson C.J. does not mention the evidence of Craven. He was an independent witness who did not know any of the parties to this litigation. There is no reflection on his veracity and there is nothing to contradict his evidence as to the manner in which the respondent crossed the intersection and that the impact took place in the traffic lane of the westerly half of the intersection at or slightly to the north of the centre line of 20th Avenue. It is, I think, not without significance that while this action was tried at Calgary on September 6, 1950, judgment was not given until March 1, 1952 and, with great respect, I think what appears to me to be the failure of the learned trial judge to give effect to the evidence of Craven, supported as it was by the evidence as to the place on the pavement where the personal belongings of the respondent were picked up or if he disbelieved it to so state, may not be unconnected with the delay of nearly a year and a half in delivering his judgment. Unless the evidence of Craven and the other evidence is to be rejected, the respondent did not angle off the direct line from the northeast corner to the northwest corner \"very slightly\": rather did she walk almost directly in a south westerly direction from the north-east corner of the intersection where she was seen by both Callbeck and Craven in the direction of the car which was about to stop or had stopped close to the curb at the southwest corner.\nThe finding of the learned trial judge that the course followed by the respondent across the intersection was not a contributing cause of the accident must be weighed in the light of his conclusion that she deviated very slightly from the direct cross-walk from the northeast to the north-west corner of the intersection. Clinton J. Ford J.A. by whom the reasons for judgment of the majority of the Court were delivered considered that the evidence of Miss Halpin placed the point of impact at approximately the centre of the west lane of vehicular traffic on Centre Street and near the centre of 20th Avenue, which would agree with the evidence of Craven as to this. This conclusion cannot be reconciled with the opinion of the learned trial judge that she had deviated very slightly from the pedestrian right-of-way. However, after saying that if she was a few feet farther to the south than her position as estimated by the learned trial judge it could not:\u2014\nbe safely inferred or held that any different situation would be created from a practical point of view than that which the learned trial judge had in mind as the driver, not seeing her, principally because of the condition of his windshield, drove straight across the intersection without any lessening of speed. the learned Justice of Appeal said:\u2014\nBut, weighing the evidence, including that of the plaintiff, who said that she distinctly remembered looking for north-bound traffic as she started to cross, but could not remember anything more, I cannot reach the conclusion with assurance that what she did amounted to negligence contributing to the accident.\nThese portions of the reasons for judgment of the majority of the Court followed a passage in which the following appears:\u2014\nThe evidence, including any fair inference therefrom must prove beyond a doubt to the satisfaction of the jury that the pedestrian did by negligence contribute to the accident, and until this has been done the onus still remains on the driver. (Geel v. Winnipeg Electric Company 4).\nIn Geel's case the Judicial Committee on an appeal from this Court 5 considered the effect of s. 62 of the Motor Vehicle Act of Manitoba, which dealt with the onus of proof in an action for damages for personal injury caused by the operation of a motor vehicle and provided that the onus of proving that the damage did not arise through the negligence of the owner or driver of the motor vehicle lay upon them. The Manitoba section, as it then read, being passed before the enactment of The Tortfeasors and Contributory Negligence Act of that province in 1939, differed from s. 94(1) of the Alberta statute, in that the words \"entirely or solely\" did not appear. These words, it may be noted, now form part of s. 81(1) of The Highway Traffic Act of Manitoba (c. 93, R.S.M. 1940). Dealing with the effect of this section the Judicial Committee, after saying that the burden remained on the defendant until the very end of the case, expressly approved the following statement of the effect of a like section in the Saskatchewan Act made by Turgeon, J.A. in Stanley v. National Fruit Company 6:\u2014\nSection 43 of the Act places the onus of proof upon the defendants. This means that the defendants must lose if no evidence of the circumstances of the accident is given at all, or if the evidence leaves the Court in a state of real doubt as to negligence or no negligence, or is so evenly balanced that the Court can come to no sure conclusion as to which of the parties to the accident is to blame. But if evidence for and against is given upon the points in question, the rule in favour of the preponderance of evidence should be applied as in ordinary civil cases, and the statutory onus will cease to be a factor in the case if the Court can come to a definite conclusion one way or the other, after hearing and weighing the whole of the testimony. Nor does this statutory onus increase the degree of diligence required in the owner or driver of a motor vehicle. His duty to others remains the same, notwithstanding the shifting of the burden of proof. He must exercise at all times the same measure of caution as might be expected, in like circumstances, of a reasonably prudent man. He must take proper precautions to guard against risks that might reasonably be anticipated to arise from time to time as he proceeds on his way. This degree of care, and nothing more, is required of him except in cases specially provided for, with which we are not concerned here.\nWith respect, I am unable to find anything in this decision to support the view that the onus is upon the defendant in the present case to prove beyond a doubt that the negligence of the respondent contributed to the accident.\nI am of the opinion that the onus placed upon the appellants by s. 94(1) has been discharged. Frank Ford J.A. concluded from the evidence that the respondent at the time of the accident had proceeded from the northeast corner of the intersection to a point approximately in the middle of 20th Avenue and approximately in the middle of the westerly half of Centre Street. I do not take it from the reasons for judgment of the majority that they disagreed with this view and, indeed, it seems to me the only conclusion consistent with the evidence. It cannot be seriously contended that she looked to her right for oncoming traffic as she walked in a southwesterly direction across the intersection. If I correctly understand that portion of the reasons for judgment delivered by Clinton J. Ford J.A., he was of the opinion that the fact that she failed to do so and failed to concede the right-of-way to the approaching truck, as required by s-s. 4 of s. 59 of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, was not negligence contributing to the accident. While not so stated, I must assume that by this it is meant that the accident would have happened in any event, even had the respondent crossed the intersection upon the cross-walk. This may or may not be so but that is not the point. This conclusion overlooks the fact that in deciding where the fault lay, not only are the actions of the driver of the truck to be considered but also those of the respondent. To say that the accident would have happened any way and to treat this as decisive is merely to consider the question of the liability of the truck driver. He was undoubtedly guilty of negligence contributing to the accident. But the respondent's actions must also be considered. The statement of the law contained in the judgment of Sir Lyman Duff C.J. in Swartz v. Wills 7, is constantly quoted in street crossing accidents of this kind but, unfortunately, not consistently followed. Dealing there with s. 21 of The Highway Act of British Columbia which in its effect is indistinguishable from s-s. 4 of s. 59 of the Alberta Statute, he said (p. 629):\u2014\nI can perceive no ambiguity or obscurity in this language. The driver approaching an intercommunicating highway is to keep a lookout for drivers approaching upon the right upon that highway and to make way for them. If everybody does this a collision is not only improbable, it is hardly possible. The respondent failed in this plain duty. This neglect of duty was the direct cause of the collision.\nThis was the duty of the respondent in the present matter as she walked diagonally across the intersection in question. The morning was clear and bright and the approaching truck was plainly visible and, failing in that duty, she walked without looking directly in the path of the truck. To say that such conduct was not a contributing cause of this accident is, in my opinion, to say that the right-of-way provisions of the statute may be ignored with impunity.\nWhether she would have been struck had she proceeded across the cross-walk, in which situation she would have had the benefit of s-s. 2 of s. 59 of the statute, is a debatable matter but, in my opinion, it is aside from the point. In Toronto Railway v. King 8, Lord Atkinson, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, said:\u2014\nIt is suggested that the deceased must have seen, or ought to have seen, the tramcar, and had no right to assume it would have been slowed down, or that its driver would have ascertained that there was no traffic with which it might come in contact before he proceeded to apply his power and cross the thoroughfare. But why not assume these things? It was the driver's duty to do them all, and traffic in the streets would be impossible if the driver of each vehicle did not proceed more or less upon the assumption that the drivers of all the other vehicles will do what it is their duty to do, namely, observe the rules regulating the traffic of the streets.\nHad the respondent been crossing on the cross-walk and had she seen the truck approaching as it was at a moderate rate from her right, she might assume that it would slow down and permit her to cross and might not realize until too late that the driver had not seen her. Had that been the situation, the fault might well have been found to be entirely that of the truck driver, but that is not this case. Mr. Justice Frank Ford in his reasons for judgment has said that the conclusion is inescapable that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence and with this I am in complete agreement. He was of the opinion that the damages should be apportioned two-thirds as against the present appellants and one-third as against the respondent. The respondent was at the time she was struck some twenty feet to the south of the cross-walk and I am unable to find any more excuse for her conduct than I am for that of the driver Desharnais. The negligence of each of them, in my opinion, continued up to the moment of the collision and the rule stated by Viscount Birkenhead in The Volute 9, applies. S. 2 of The Contributory Negligence Act (c. 116 R.S.A. 1942) provides that, where by the fault of two or more persons, damage or loss is caused to one or more of them, the liability to make good the damage or loss shall be in proportion to the degree in which each person was at fault. S. 2(a) provides that if, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it is not possible to establish different degrees of fault, the liability shall be apportioned equally. In this matter I find myself quite unable to distinguish any difference in the degree of fault of the driver Desharnais and that of the unfortunate respondent and I would accordingly apportion the blame equally between them and find the appellant liable for fifty per cent of the damages awarded by the learned trial judge.\nWhile the damages awarded appear to me to be very high, I do not think a case has been made out to warrant any reduction in the amount.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal. The respondent should recover her costs of the action up to the conclusion of the trial under Column 5 on the old scale in effect when the action was tried.\nI would dismiss the cross-appeal without costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs and cross-appeal without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Fenerty, Fenerty, McGillivray & Robertson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Millard & Woolliams.\n1 (1952) 6 W.W.R.

The appellant, \"Western Leaseholds Limited, was lessee from its co-appellant. Both appellants sued for a declaration that they were the registered and equitable owners of all minerals and\/or valuable stone including the sand and gravel within, upon or under the said lands and for certain other relief. The actions were consolidated and tried together and judgment was given in favour of the appellants. Following the filing of notice of appeal by the respondents, The Sand and Gravel Act, S. of A., 1951, c. 77, came into force providing that as to all lands in the Province the owner of the surface of land is and shall be deemed at all times to have been the owner of and entitled to all sand and gravel on the surface of that land and obtained or otherwise recovered by surface operations. By order of the Appellate Division, Gaumont and Brown were permitted to raise the terms of the Statute as a further ground of appeal. The Appeal Court allowed the appeal and dismissed the plaintiffs' action. On appeal to this Court.\nHeld: 1.\u2014That the appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand, Kellock, Estey and Oartwright, JJ.:\u2014 The appellants failed to establish that \"mines, minerals, petroleum, gas, coal and valuable stone\" in their Certificate of Title should be construed as including sand and gravel.\nPer Locke, J.\u2014Apart from the provisions of The Sand and Gravel Act, the only question to be determined was the meaning of the language employed in the certificate of title by reason of s. 62 of The Land Titles Act (R.S.A. 1942, c. 205) and on the proper construction of that instrument, sand and gravel were included. The appellants should, therefore, have their costs of the trial.\n2. Per Curiam\u2014That The Sand and Gravel Act is intra vires of the Provincial Legislature and is declaratory of what is and has always been the law of Alberta, and so applied to the present litigation and is fatal to the appellants' claim.\nAPPEALS from the judgments of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta 1 which allowed the Defendants' appeals from the judgments of Egbert J. 2 in favour of the Plaintiffs. The two actions were brought by the Plaintiffs for a declaration that they were the registered and equitable owners of all minerals and\/or valuable stone including sand and gravel, upon or under certain lands the title to the surface of which was vested in the Defendants and for certain other relief. The two actions were consolidated and tried together. The Defendant, Beaver Sand & Gravel Ltd., took no part in the action. By leave of the Court, the Farmers Union of Alberta was permitted to intervene. Following the delivery of judgment by the trial judge The Sand and Gravel Act, 1951, S. of A., c. 77, came into force and the Defendants who, in the meantime had filed notice of appeal, applied for and were granted leave to amend and plead the Act as a further ground of appeal. The Plaintiffs then served the Attorney General for the Province of Alberta with notice that they intended to bring into question the constitutional validity of the Act and thereafter, by order of the Appellate Division, the Attorney General was added as a party Defendant.\nH. W. Riley Q.C. and H. Patterson for the appellants.\nW. G. Morrow for the respondents.\nJ. J. Frawley, Q.C. for the Attorney General of Alberta.\nJ. A. Ross for the Farmers Union of Alberta, Intervenant.\nKerwin J.:\u2014On the argument the Court decided that The Sand and Gravel Act, c. 77 of the 1951 Statutes of Alberta was intra vires. That Act applies to the present litigation and on this point I agree with the reasons of my brother Cartwright. However, the statute was enacted after the judgment at the trial and if at the date of that decision the appellants were entitled to judgment in their favour as the trial judge held, they should have, at least, the very considerable costs of the action, including the trial.\nI have come to the conclusion that the appellants were not so entitled. At the outset it should be emphasized that the plaintiff, Western Minerals Limited, was registered as owner pursuant to The Land Titles Act of the Province of Alberta of an estate in fee simple of and in all mines, minerals, petroleum, gas, coal and valuable stone in or under the lands in question in the two actions and the right to enter upon or occupy such portions of the lands as may be necessary or convenient for the purpose of working, mining, removing and obtaining the benefit of the said mines, minerals, petroleum, gas, coal and valuable stone. On the other hand, the respondent Gaumont has a certificate of title that he is the owner of an estate in fee simple in his lands \"reserving thereout all mines and minerals. Subject to the exceptions, reservations and conditions contained in transfer of record as 6489 B.D.\" The reservation in this transfer, dated April 5, 1915, from a former owner, Western Canada Land Co. Limited, to one Bolster, reads:\u2014\"reserving to the transferor, its successors and assigns, all mines, minerals, petroleum, gas, coal and valuable stone in or under the said land and the right to enter upon and occupy such portions of the said lands as may be necessary or convenient for the purpose of working, mining, removing, and obtaining the benefit of the said mines, minerals, petroleum, gas, coal, and valuable stone.\" Similarly, the respondent Brown has a certificate of title dated November 16, 1945, as owner of an estate in fee simple in his lands \"reserving thereout all mines and minerals and the right to work the same as set forth in transfer of record as 5755 F.V.\" This transfer from a prior owner to Brown is dated August 1, 1945, and the reservation is the same as that in the transfer of Gaumont's lands from Western Canada Land Co. Limited to Bolster.\nWhile there is no evidence as to when the certificate of title was granted by which the appellant, Western Minerals Limited, is declared to be the owner of the mines, minerals, etc. its date is of no importance. The question for determination is whether under the terms of the three certificates of title the sand and gravel in the lands are owned by the respondents Brown and Gaumont respectively or by Western Minerals Limited. In Attorney General for the Isle of Man v. Moore 3, Lord Wright, speaking for the Judicial Committee, at page 267, states (referring to a statute): \"The principles to be applied in determining such a question have now been established by decisions of the House of Lords dealing with words of reservation in the Railway Clauses Act and similar Acts.\" In the earlier case of Attorney General for the Isle of Man v. Mylchreest 4 the Judicial Committee had arrived at the same conclusion as the House of Lords, and it might be noted that in Re McAllister v. Toronto Suburban R.W. Co. 5, the Ontario Court of Appeal considered these decisions applicable in an expropriation under s. 133 of the then Ontario Railway Act. All of these decisions were as to the meaning of certain statutes and the effect of the decision of the Privy Council in the Moore case is that the same principles are to be applied to the construction of statutory provisions of an entirely different type. I see no reason that they should not also be applied to the construction of certificates of title under The Land Titles Act (R.S.A. 1942, c. 205). S. 62 of that Act provides that \"every certificate of title \u2026 shall \u2026 be conclusive evidence \u2026 that the person named therein is entitled to the land included in the same for the estate or interest therein specified.\" The point is whether the estate or interest of the parties includes the sand and gravel.\nIt was not contended that they fell within the term \"mines\" but it was urged that they were \"minerals\". The enumeration of \"petroleum, gas, coal and valuable stone\" affords a context to show that the word is not used in its widest sense: Attorney General for the Isle of Man v. Mylchreest (supra); Barnard-Argue-Roth-Stearns Oil and Gas Co. Ltd. v. Farquharson 6. Furthermore, I am quite sure that Gaumont and Brown, as holders of certificates of title, or any other purchasers of lands in Alberta would never imagine that sand and gravel were excluded from their estate or interest under \"minerals\": Lord Provost v. Farie 7. My brother Kellock has detailed the evidence adduced on behalf of the appellants and I therefore do not repeat it. It is quite apparent that that evidence falls far short of showing that in the mining and commercial world, and by land owners, sand and gravel were considered to be minerals. There can be really no question that, as held by the trial judge, sand and gravel do not come within the term \"stone\".\nThe appeals should be dismissed with costs payable by the appellants to the respondents Gaumont and Brown. There should be no order as to the costs of the Attorney General of Alberta or of the intervenant.\nRand J.:\u2014Two questions are raised in this appeal: whether a reservation of \"all mines, minerals, petroleum, gas, coal and valuable stone\" contained in two conveyances of land in Alberta, includes sand and gravel, both of which will be embraced within the treatment of the latter; and whether a statute passed after judgment at trial, effects retroactively the exclusion of gravel from the scope of the reservation.\nEvidence was adduced to show the place of gravel in the scientific and engineering classifications of minerals, which was undoubtedly pertinent to the issue; but as the question arises out of the sale and purchase of land, the understanding of persons who deal in land or its constituents is of primary importance; and in the circumstances here there are factors of special significance to that understanding. In Crown grants of lands in the colonies the reservation of mines and minerals was exceptional, but in western Canada from the early stages of its organization that was not the case. The uninhabited territory of what was later called the Northwest Territories, then little better than a wilderness, was transferred to the Dominion by an Imperial Order-in-Council in 1870. In the course of the subsequent administration, including a comprehensive immigration program, the Dominion Government in 1889 by an order authorized by the Dominion Lands Act, provided for the reservation of mines and minerals in grants made under that Act. There is not readily accessible the extent of land patented between that date and 1905; but the reports of the Commissions on Western Lands and Subsidies submitted to Parliament in 1935 show that between 1905, when Alberta and Saskatchewan were formed, and 1930, when the remaining public lands were transferred to them, approximately fifty million acres had been disposed of, the individual applications for which approached three hundred thousand in number. This was in addition to at least nine million acres granted after 1905 on commitments made before that time. From this uniform practice, the reservation became notorious throughout the West, and a matter of common knowledge in land dealings. Large areas had, it is true, been conveyed to the Hudson's Bay Company and to railway companies without reservation, but these were widely known as exceptions to the generality of titles.\nSince 1931 the same policy has been continued by statutory provisions in all three provinces, Manitoba, Revised Statutes (1940) c. 48; Saskatchewan, Revised Statutes (1940) c. 37; and Alberta, statutes of 1949, c. 81; in all of them the expression \"mines and minerals\" is found.\nFrom the commencement, also, of the Dominion administration, a form of the so-called Torrens system of land titles has been in force. By its effect the ownership of land is conclusively evidenced by an official Certificate of Title, and this system has, likewise, been continued by the provinces since their formation.\nIn this background of uniformity of public administration and of phraseology in relation to mines and minerals, and the formal establishment of title by certificate, it would, I think, be difficult to attribute to that collocation of words any other than the same meaning throughout that western territory, certainly, on the record here, throughout Alberta ; and, apart from questions, as between the immediate parties to a transfer, of rectifying the certificate, it would be a rare case in which an enquiry into the actual or presumed intentions of parties to a grant or transfer, where the same expression is alone in question, would be justified. What is to be sought, then, is the general sense of those words in the vernacular of engineers, business men and land owners, the latter of whom constitute a substantial fraction of the population in the prairie section. The recent decision of the Judicial Committee in Borys v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company 8, dealing with the word \"petroleum\", adopted that use as the determinant of its scope.\nThe vernacular is, in turn, a fact itself to be ascertained. There are varying degrees of appreciation of the meaning of words, and, apart from the opinions of individuals, positive data evidencing the common acceptation are not always at hand; but one of reliability is that of neutral conduct which indicates the assumption of such an acceptation.\nIt is, therefore, of some significance, that although gravel in general building and railway construction has long been used as material, and during the past thirty years, most extensively in road building, no case has been cited in which the question here has been directly raised before a Canadian court. That seems to be particularly noteworthy in relation to railways. By The Railway Act, 1903, as well as its revision of today, the sections which authorize expropriation of land do not entitle the company to the mines or minerals unless expressly purchased. On the other hand, the statute provides, as in s. 202 of the present Act, that \"any stone, gravel, earth, sand, water or other material\" required for the construction, maintenance or operation of the railway may, for any such purpose, be taken. The inclusion of the word \"gravel\" in this context points, at least in the understanding of Parliament, to a genus of materials forming part of land which embraces gravel but excludes minerals. In the first twenty years of this century, a vast network of railways was built in the West for which immense quantities of gravel were required for ballasting, a great deal of which must have been obtained from lands in which the minerals were reserved to the Crown; but nothing has been disclosed to suggest a claim for compensation ever asserted by the Dominion.\nGeologically, the soil was formed by the disintegration of hard surface minerals plus the later ingestion of vegetable matter. Gravel is produced in the course of that disintegration by the attrition of rock fragments and contains all sizes from a grain of sand to stones of several inches in diameter. The difference, then, between the ordinary soil and gravel is a matter largely of gradation in physical refinement of a common substance, and that fact may explain the absence of previous controversy through the natural tendency to treat the latter as ordinary roughage of the soil rather than discrete mineral substance.\nViewing the evidential matters and opinions placed before the Court in the light of these considerations, I take the vernacular sense of the words \"mines and minerals\" not to extend to gravel.\nBut the reservation before us, by the additional words \"valuable stone\", itself evidences that exclusion. Stone, lacking any real use qua land, has, from the earliest times, been used for building all manner of structures, and so far has acquired a higher degree of distinctiveness from the soil than gravel: it was and is that utility that gives it special character and value. It is not seriously contended that \"valuable stone\" includes gravel, but its presence in the reservation implies that other stone is excluded, which, a fortiori, excludes material produced by a fragmentation of stone that basically changes its useful character.\nThen is the legislation to be interpreted as a prospective alteration of the previous law or a retroactive declaration of what the law was prior to the judgment at trial? Here is a case in which the boundary between property rights, depending upon the scope to be given general words in common parlance, is somewhat vague and uncertain, and in which the determination by the legislature can safely be taken to express the general understanding of the language being interpreted. That in such a situation and by way of precaution the legislature should resort to a declaration of pre-existing law arises from an apprehension of widespread disruption of what are thought to be settled interests. For that purpose the legislature has access to sources of relevative considerations not effectively available to a court of justice. The word \"shall\" in the context implies a conclusive effect to the words \"be deemed\" and, that, considering the recitals in the preamble, the expression was intended to operate upon the subject matter of these proceedings, I entertain no doubt. The Appeal Division was consequently concluded by it.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKellock, J.:\u2014These appeals raise the same question, namely, the proper construction of a reservation in certain certificates of title to lands in the province of Alberta of the following reservation: \"all mines, minerals, petroleum, gas, coal and valuable stone in or under the said land and the right to enter upon and occupy such portion of the said land as may be necessary or convenient for the purpose of working, mining, removing and obtaining the benefit of the said mines, minerals, petroleum, gas, coal and valuable stone.\"\nIn the case of the respondent Gaumont the certificate is dated July 11, 1928, while that of the respondent Brown is dated August 1, 1945. These certificates are to be read in conjunction with s. 62 of The Land Titles Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 205.\nThe appellants are entitled to the benefit of these reservations and claim title thereunder to the sand and gravel in, upon or under the lands. They contend that sand and gravel are \"minerals\" within the meaning of that term as used in the reservations. This contention was given effect to by the learned trial judge, but was rejected by the Appellate Division which also held that the respondents were, in any event, protected by The Sand and Gravel Act of Alberta, 15 Geo. VI, c. 77, passed on April 7, 1951, after delivery of the judgment at trial.\nThe word \"minerals\", standing alone, and considered in contradistinction to animal or vegetable substances, would no doubt include such materials as sand and gravel. In Darvill v. Roper, 9, Kindersley V. C. said at p. 299, in reference to a similar contention, that\nEvery portion of the soil, not merely the limestone rock, but the gravel, the pebbles, all, even to the very substance of the loam or mould which forms the soil, would be included.\nIn Attorney-General for the Isle of Man v. Mylchreest, 10, Sir Montague Smith pointed out, in the Judicial Committee, considerations which enter into the question as to the sense in which the word may, in any particular case, have been used, as follows:\u2014\nIt was contended for the Crown that the word \"minerals\" used in the clause comprehended clay and sand. Doubtless, the word in its scientific and widest sense may include substances of this nature, and, when unexplained by the context or by the nature and circumstances of the transaction, or by usage (where evidence of usage is admissible), would, in most cases, do so. But the word has also a more limited and popular meaning, which would not embrace such substances, and it may be shewn by any of the above-mentioned modes of explanation that in the particular instrument to be construed, it was employed in this narrower sense.\nIt seems plain from the context in the case at bar that the word is not used in its widest sense. At page 308 of Mylchreest's case, Sir Montague Smith said with respect to the language there in question,\nIf the word \"minerals\" were intended to be used in its widest signification, it was obviously unnecessary to make specific mention of flagg, slate and stone.\nSimilarly, in the case at bar there is an enumeration of substances which would be quite unnecessary if \"minerals\" were employed in the broad sense.\nIn. Barnard-Argue-Roth-Stearns Oil and Gas Co., Ltd. v. Farquharson, 11, the Judicial Committee had to consider a conveyance which reserved to the grantor \"all mines and quarries of metals and minerals and all springs of oil \u2026\" Lord Atkinson, delivering the opinion of the Board, expressed the same idea at p. 869 as follows:\nIt is obvious, however, for several reasons, that in this clause of the grant the word \"minerals\" is not used in this wide and general sense. First, because two substances are expressly mentioned in the clause which would be certainly covered by the word \"minerals\" used in its widest sense, namely, \"metals\" and \"springs of oil in or under the said land \u2026\" Lord Gorell in Budhill's case, 12, put the matter as follows at p. 134:\u2014\nThe enumeration of certain specified matters tends to show that its object was to except exceptional matters.\nIf the broad meaning is not to be given to the word in the reservation here in question, the onus would appear to be on those who assert, in doubtful cases at least, that the word is inclusive of the substance in controversy: Savill v. Bethell, 13. It may very well be that such a substance as \"lead\" would obviously fall within the scope of such a reservation, but where, as here, \"coal and valuable stone\" are specifically mentioned, it is incumbent, in my opinion, upon those who assert that such ordinary materials as sand and gravel were intended to be included, to establish this.\nIn Attorney-General for Isle of Man v. Moore, 14, Lord Wright, delivering the opinion of the Privy Council, reaffirmed the principles to be applied as follows:\u2014\nThe principles to be applied in determining such a question have now been established by decisions of the House of Lords \u2026 that this type of question is an issue of fact to be decided according to the particular circumstances of the case, the duty of the court being to determine what the words meant in the vernacular of mining men, commercial men and land owners at the relevant time. Such an issue is necessarily an issue of fact because it must depend on evidence of the actual user of the words\u2014that is, the way in which they were in practice used by the classes of persons enumerated.\nThe learned trial judge was of opinion that the sand and gravel question in the case at bar were \"not separable either commercially or geologically\" and dealt with them as forming one deposit. He referred to them throughout his judgment as gravel only. In his view, the deposit did not come within the word \"mines\" as used in the conveyances, as he was of opinion that it had been authoritatively determined by the decisions that a \"mine\" was limited to underground workings and that there was nothing in the evidence before him to indicate that the word should have any other meaning in the present instance. It is not necessary to consider this particular aspect of the matter as the appellants do not rely on the word \"mines\" but on the word \"minerals\". The learned judge was also of opinion on the evidence that the words \"valuable stone\" in the conveyances in the case at bar were limited to cut stone and that they did not include \"gravel\".\nWith respect to the meaning of the word \"minerals\" in the present certificates, the learned judge concluded that the appellants had established on the evidence that it included gravel, although he expressed \"a strong suspicion\" that that was not the intention of the parties to the transactions but that if sand and gravel had been mentioned at the date of the original conveyances, they would have been excluded from the reservations. It is necessary to examine the evidence.\nThe appellants rely in the first place upon the testimony of a member of the engineering faculty of a university who, in addition to his academic duties, carries on a consulting practice in connection with the construction industry. This witness testified as follows:\u2014\nQ. In the phraseology or popular language of a mining man, is a commercial deposit of gravel surface or soil or minerals or what?\nA. Well, in my opinion, it is a mineral. The reason for that is that in the general definition a mineral is anything that is not plant or animal.\nQ. Yes?\nA. The use of the \"commercial\" though, restricts it so that your mineral material as contained in a conveyance has to have some commercial value. Well, a gravel deposit that is being worked for profit obviously has commercial value, and by fundamental definition it is a mineral, and therefore it is a mineral substance.\nThis evidence is, of course, completely worthless in that it is pure argument and does not answer at all the relevant question as to the meaning of the word \"minerals\" in the vernacular of mining men. The witness made a similar attempt to include gravel within the meaning of \"valuable stone.\" He said:\u2014\nWell, on the question of the definition of valuable stone as it is most commonly used or as it has most commonly been used, it probably has meant stone that was quarried; in other words, building blocks that were taken out or blocks of stone that were taken out and then faced off and so on and turned into building stone. On the other hand, you don't have to extend the definition any appreciable amount to include gravel as a valuable stone. It definitely is valuable and it is stone. The appellants also rely on the evidence of a chemical engineer who is an officer of the appellant Western Minerals Limited. When asked the following question in chief:\nQ. Now, sir, you and your companies are in the mining game in its various branches. In the phraseology, or, if you like, the popular language of the mining world, what is gravel? Mineral or surface?\nhe answered,\nA. I would say it was a mineral.\nIt is not too clear what was intended by the question itself. The contrast is between \"mineral\" on the one hand and \"surface\" on the other, and in the case of a transfer of surface rights exclusively it may be that, in certain circumstances, gravel would not pass to the grantee. But such a question is not the relevant question. It is whether or not, when used in its ordinary sense by mining men, the word \"minerals\" would be understood as inclusive of gravel. That question was neither put nor answered. The following additional testimony of the same witness does not clarify matters:\u2014\nQ. If that sand could be sold today, would it be considered as a mineral?\nA. If it was handled commercially at commercial rates I would say so.\nQ. Is that your standard?\nA. I believe that is what makes it commercial.\n. . .\nQ. Well, in a chemical sense there is no doubt that sand would be a mineral, is there? I am speaking in the commercial sense. If you could sell that sand today would it be a mineral?\nA. Yes, it has value.\nQ. And if you can't sell it then today, it isn't a mineral in the commercial sense? Correct?\nA. Yes, I will answer that yes.\nI do not think, therefore, that there is any evidence in the record at all on this aspect of the matter.\nWith respect to the understanding of land owners, the appellants called an employee of the Hudson's Bay Company who had been employed by that company since 1931. He described himself as a \"land department representative\" or \"inspector\". What the duties of this witness are, does not appear. He testified that the Hudson's Bay Company had originally owned two and a quarter million acres of land in the province of Alberta, of which there remained unsold approximately sixty thousand acres. Whether or not the witness had anything to do with the land sold or any part of it, or what sales were made since 1931, he did not say. The following evidence of the witness is relied on by the appellants:\u2014\nQ. Now, the Hudson's Bay Company granted a number of commercial gravel permits on lands from which they have parted with the surface?\nA. Yes, sir.\n. . .\nQ. In these various gravel permit transactions which you have spoken about with the Hudson's Bay Company, are they all cases in which the Hudson's Bay Company owned minerals and valuable stone?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. All right, sir. In the understanding of land representatives is gravel a mineral or part of the surface?\nA. I would say mineral.\nThe same infirmity appears in this evidence as in that of the previous witness to which I have just referred, the attention of the witness being directed to the contrast between \"mineral\" and \"surface\" and not to the real question. Moreover, his evidence is presumably based upon the dispositions of lands made by the Hudson's Bay 'Company, but his knowledge of such transactions or of the language of the conveyances does not appear. In my opinion, his evidence does not touch the question as to the meaning of \"minerals\" as ordinarily used by owners of land.\nIt was for the appellants to establish that the word \"minerals\" is here used in the sense of including either sand or gravel. I think they have failed to do so.\nIt is not without relevance to observe that the lands in question were sold on the one hand and bought on the other for agricultural purposes. So far as any vendor or purchaser knew at the time of the grants, it might have developed that the whole or the greater part of the lands were underlaid with gravel, to get at which would have destroyed the lands for the purposes for which they were purchased, in which event the grant would have been swallowed up by the reservation. In my view, as pointed out by Lord 'Gorell in Budhill's case, supra, the enumeration of the specific substances indicates that the intention was to reserve exceptional substances only. Sand and gravel deposits are no doubt less frequent in the Edmonton area than apparently they are in the neighbourhood of Calgary, but the specific exception of \"valuable stone\", in my opinion, indicates that the parties intended that apart from building stone, other stone or allied substances such as sand or gravel were not reserved.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeals with costs.\nEstey, J.:\u2014I agree that the appeal should be dismissed on the basis both, as the learned judges in the Appellate Division held, that the word \"minerals,\" as used in the reservations, did not include sand and gravel and that, upon the principle underlying Boulevard Heights v. Veilleux 15, the provisions of The Sand and Gravel Act are applicable to this litigation.\nLocke J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta setting aside the judgment delivered at the trial by Egbert J. in favour of the present appellants in these consolidated actions.\nThe issues concern the ownership of deposits of sand and gravel in the northeast quarter of Section 21 in Township 55 and Range 22 west of the 4th Meridian in the Province of Alberta and the southwest quarter of Section 21 in Township 57 and Range 21 west of the said Meridian, of which lands the respondents Gaumont and Brown are respectively the registered owners of what have been referred to in these proceedings, for the purpose of convenience, as the surface rights.\nAs against the respondent Gaumont the appellants claimed, in addition to a declaration of right, an injunction restraining him from removing either sand or gravel from the land and damages for trespass in respect of quantities of these materials theretofore taken from the land by this respondent. The respondent Brown had entered into an agreement with the respondent Beaver Sand and Gravel Limited, under which that company had removed and was continuing to remove gravel and sand from the property, and, as against them, the appellants claimed, in addition to a declaration of right, an injunction to restrain the removal of further material, an accounting and damages. At the outset of the trial a written admission made by the solicitor for the respondents Gaumont and Brown was read into the record, this being that the plaintiff Western Minerals Limited was:\u2014\nregistered as owner pursuant to The Land Titles Act of the Province of Alberta of an estate in fee simple of and in all mines, minerals, petroleum, gas, coal and valuable stone in or under\nthe said lands\nand the right to enter upon or occupy such portions of the lands as may be necessary or convenient for the purpose of working, mining, removing and obtaining the benefit of the said mines, minerals, petroleum, gas, coal and valuable stone.\nVarious transfers and agreements of sale evidencing dealing with these lands by the parties and others and the predecessors in title of the appellant Western Minerals Limited and the respondents Gaumont and Brown were filed and, in the reasons for judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Alberta delivering the unanimous opinion of the Appellate Division, various of these instruments have been referred to as an aid to the interpretation of the expressions \"mines and minerals\" in these several documents. From these it appears that in the year 1915 the Western Canada Land Company Limited transferred the northeast quarter of Section 21 of the surface rights of which the respondent Gaumont is now the registered owner to one Bolster, with a reservation of the mines and minerals and other named mineral substances and the right to enter and work the same, and thereafter a certificate of title for the said lands issued to Gaumont excepting the mines and mineral substances reserved in the transfer to Bolster. The respondent Brown had agreed to purchase the said southwest quarter of Section 21 from one of the predecessors in title of the appellant Western Minerals Limited by an agreement made in the year 1940, by which the vendor reserved the mines and mineral rights in similar, though not identical, terms to those expressed in the transfer to Bolster and it was shown that, as far back as 1919, the respondent Brown's father had agreed to purchase the land from the then registered owner in an agreement containing a like reservation and had thereafter entered into an agreement in similar terms for the purchase of the land in 1928. In the case of the respondent Brown, a certificate of title under the provisions of The Land Titles Act had been issued in the year 1945, with an exception as to mines and minerals and the right to work the same in similar terms.\nIn addition to these documents, evidence was given which made it quite clear that both Gaumont and Brown purchased these lands for agricultural purposes and that they have lived there and farmed the lands for a long period of years prior to the commencement of these actions and to show that the gravel, and such sand as is intermingled with it, cannot be removed without destroying the surface and rendering that portion of the land thereafter worthless for farming purposes.\nWith respect for contrary opinions, I think none of this evidence was relevant to the issue raised by the pleadings and decided by Mr. Justice Egbert. That question was as to the interpretation to be placed upon the language of the certificate of title of the appellant Western Minerals Limited which is above referred to. It is so restricted, in my opinion, by the provisions of s. 62 of The Land Titles Act (c. 205, R.S.A. 1942) which, so far as relevant, reads as follows:\nEvery certificate of title granted under this Act shall (except in case of fraud wherein the owner has participated or colluded) so long as the same remains in force and uncancelled under this Act be conclusive evidence in all courts as against His Majesty and all persons whomsoever that the person named therein is entitled to the land included in the same, for the estate or interest therein specified, subject to the exceptions and reservations mentioned in section 61, except so far as regards any portion of land by wrong description of boundaries or parcels included in the certificate of title and except as against any person claiming under a prior certificate of title granted under this Act or granted under any law heretofore in force relating to titles to real property in respect of the same land.\nThe reservations mentioned in s. 61, other than those which are irrelevant to the present considerations, are merely any subsisting reservations or exceptions contained in the original grant of the land from the Crown. These lands formed part of the lands originally granted by the Government of Canada to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and there is no evidence that the grant contained any exceptions and there were none such in the conveyance of the said lands to the Western Canada Land Company Limited, one of the predecessors in title of the appellant Western Minerals Limited. There is no evidence that there was any prior certificate of title relating to the interest of the appellant Western Minerals Limited declared by the certificate of title in question in existence. The title of the said appellant to the mines, minerals and other mineral substances described in it is not in any way impeached.\nS. 62 of The Land Titles Act, with a change which does not affect the matter to be considered, re-enacted s. 57 of The Land Titles Act (57-58 Vict. c. 28) enacted by the Parliament of Canada, dealing with titles to land in the Northwest Territories and the manner of its disposition. The system of landholding adopted by the Federal Act and by the Province of Alberta in 1905 was that which has come to be known as the Torrens system, the object of which was to provide a system of landholding where the root of the title was a certificate granted under governmental authority, which would declare an absolute and indefeasible title to realty or to some interest therein and to simplify its transfer. The first of the Acts providing for such a system was enacted by the South Australian Legislature, at the instance of Sir Robert Torrens, in 1858, and it was thereafter adopted in all of the States of the Commonwealth of Australia, the declared purpose of such statutes being as above stated (Hogg's Australian Torrens System, p. 1). It would, in my opinion,\" be directly contrary to the true intent and meaning of The Land Titles Act to allow the estate declared by the certificate of title to be cut down or limited in any manner by evidence as to the intention of the parties to earlier dealings with the land in question to be inferred from the language of agreements made between them or conveyances made pursuant to such agreements such as have been admitted in the present case. The extent of the rights of the appellant Western Minerals Limited is declared by the certificate of title and the first matter to be determined is the meaning of the language employed in that document as of the date from which the judgment at the trial was delivered.\nThe certificate of title declares Western Minerals Limited to be the owner of all mines, minerals, petroleum, gas, coal and valuable stone in or under the said lands. Grammatically, this means all mines, all minerals, all petroleum, all gas, all coal and all valuable stone, as is pointed out by Lord Russell of Killowen in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Knight Sugar Co. v. Alberta Ry. & Irrigation Co. 16. In Attorney General of Ontario v. Mercer 17, in considering the interpretation to be placed upon the 109th section of the British North America Act, the Earl of Selborne, L.C. in dealing with the contention that the natural meaning to be assigned to the word \"royalties\" should be restricted, said (p. 778) :\u2014\nIt is a sound maxim of law, that every word ought, prim\u00e2 facie, to be construed in its primary and natural sense, unless a secondary or more I limited sense is required by the subject or the context.\nIt is this principle that should be applied in construing the language of this certificate of title.\nThe material, the ownership of which is in dispute, consists of deposits which lay a short distance beneath the surface upon the lands in question. On Gaumont's land it was some 35 acres in extent and on Brown's some 8 acres. The expert witnesses called who dealt with the point agreed that these were glacial deposits and it is common ground that such material did not constitute the subsoil of the remaining portions of either quarter section or any material part of it. Mr. R. M. Hardy, the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Alberta, speaking generally of the substance which is designated as gravel, said that it is largely composed of various types of rock and in this area of limestone rocks and contains felspar, silica and in some cases mica. The gravel on the Gaumont pit was estimated by the witness John E. Prothroe, a graduate engineer, to run about 40 per cent gravel and 60 per cent fines (without defining the latter term). The deposits on Brown's land were estimated at about 60 per cent gravel and 40 per cent fines. Sand was mingled with the gravel to some extent in both deposits. A sample taken from the pit on Gaumont's land and which is said to be representative shows the material to contain quantities of small stones, the largest of which is not more than an inch in diameter, quantities of much smaller stones and particles of stone as well as sand. A witness, D. S. Harvie, a chemical engineer who had examined the material in both pits, said that the quality was better than in other pits in the area and that in the Brown pit the stones or pebbles were very uniform in size which was uncommon and made it what he described as a \"premium\" gravel. During the course of the examination-in-chief of Dean Hardy at a time when the learned trial judge was directing questions to the witness, counsel for the present appellants said that he did not think that the defendants challenged the \"scientific fact that the gravel itself was a mineral\" and counsel for the respondents then said: \"From the straight geological standpoint we are not opposing that proposition\" and later that the defendants did not suggest that it was not a mineral.\nThe date upon which the certificate of title in question was issued was not proven. The appellant Western Minerals Limited was, however, incorporated on April 18, 1944, and it is, in my opinion, a proper inference from the documents filed that the certificate was issued later in that year. I am unable to find in the record, whether in the evidence tendered on behalf of the present appellants or the present respondents, anything to support a contention that the word \"minerals\" or the expression \"all minerals\" conveyed at that time or thereafter any meaning other than their ordinary or natural meaning. The material in question is admittedly a mineral substance and was contained in deposits situate beneath the surface of the land differing entirely in their nature from the surrounding lands. The enumeration of petroleum, gas, coal and valuable stone following the word \"minerals\" in the certificate cannot restrict, in my opinion, the meaning to be assigned to the word. If the language was that of an agreement or conveyance, inferences as to the intention of the parties might restrict the meaning of the term. I think also if the word was contained in an Act of the Legislature the meaning of the term might be affected by circumstances from which it might be inferred that the intention of the Legislature was to give it other than its natural meaning. No such consideration, however, can affect the construction of the language of a certificate of title issued pursuant to the provisions of The Land Titles Act. Applying the principle stated in Attorney General of Ontario v. Mercer, which is not of course limited in its application to statutes, I can find nothing in the context in which the word is used, or in the nature of the subject matter, which requires the word to be construed in other than its primary and natural sense. This, in my opinion, was the state of the law as of the date of the commencement of this action and as of the date of the judgment at the trial. The situation, however, appears to me to be materially altered by the enactment of The Sand and Gravel Act by the Legislature of Alberta following the judgment at the trial and before the appeal of the present respondents came on for hearing before the Appellate Division.\nWhile the validity of this legislation was questioned, in consequence of which the Attorney General of the Province intervened in the litigation, this Court decided during the course of the hearing that the statute lay within the powers of the Provincial Legislature under head 13 of section 92 of the British North America Act. The preamble to the statute refers to the judgment given following the trial of the present action, and by section three it is declared that the owner of the surface of land is and shall be deemed to be and at all times to have been the owner of and entitled to all sand and gravel obtained by stripping off the overburden, excavating from the surface or otherwise recovered by surface operations. I am unable to construe this language, when read with the context, in any other way than as a declaration that this has always been the law. Accordingly, the word \"minerals\" in the certificate of title should have been construed as excluding the material in question and effect must be given to this direction of the Legislature.\nIn my opinion, this appeal should be dismissed with costs. As I think the present appellants were entitled to succeed at the trial and have lost the benefit of that judgment only by reason of the enactment of The Sand and Gravel Act I would allow them the costs of the trial. I think there should be no costs in the Court of Appeal.\nCartwright, J. (concurred in by Taschereau, J.):\u2014The issue in these appeals is as to the ownership of certain sand and gravel situate in or under the lands of the respondents Gaumont and Brown. These respondents are the owners of what was, as a matter of convenience, referred to on the arguments as \"the surface\" of the lands in question. They appear to be the owners in fee simple of such lands subject to a reservation in favour of the appellant Western Minerals Limited and those claiming under it. It is admitted that, as a result of such reservation having been made, the said appellant is \"the owner of an estate in fee simple in all mines, minerals, petroleum, gas, coal and valuable stone in or under such lands, together with the right to enter upon or occupy such portions of the said lands as may be necessary or convenient for the purpose of working, mining, removing and obtaining the benefit of the said mines, minerals, petroleum, gas, coal and valuable stone.\"\nIn or about the year 1942 the respondent Gaumont opened a gravel pit on his lands and has been disposing of gravel therefrom since that time. In 1948 the respondent Brown made an agreement with the respondent Beaver Sand and Gravel Limited pursuant to which that company had been taking gravel from his land. There are concurrent findings of fact, and I did not understand it to be questioned before us, that the gravel in both pits is covered by a black top soil about one inch in depth followed by from five to seven inches of light brown soil which is in turn followed by sand and gravel to a depth not exceeding eight feet and that it is not possible to remove sand or gravel from the pits without destroying the surface. It seems clear that any gravel or sand which has been taken or is proposed to be taken from the lands in question has been or will be recovered by surface operations.\nThe action against Gaumont was commenced in August 1949 and that against Brown in July 1950. In each action the plaintiffs claimed a declaration that they are \"the registered and equitable owners of all minerals and\/or valuable stone including the sand and gravel within, upon or under the said lands\", an injunction, an accounting, and damages for trespass. The actions were consolidated for the purposes of trial and were tried before Egbert J. on October 11 and 12, 1950. That learned judge gave judgment on February 9, 1951 in favour of the plaintiffs. Judgment was entered on February 28, 1951. A notice of appeal was given on behalf of the defendants in each action on March 8, 1951. On April 7, 1951, The Sand and Gravel Act being Chapter 77 of the Statutes of Alberta, 1951, was assented to and came into force. By order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta the defendants were permitted to amend the notices of appeal by including the terms of the last-mentioned Statute as a further ground of appeal. On August 16, 1951, notice was given on behalf of the plaintiffs that they intended to question the constitutional validity of The Sand and Gravel Act. On September 24, 1951 by order of the Appellate Division the Attorney-General of the Province of Alberta was added as a party defendant.\nThe appeals were heard on September 24 and 25, 1951. Judgment was delivered on October 19, 1951, allowing the appeals, dismissing the actions, declaring the defendants to be the owners of the sand and gravel in or under the lands in question, declaring The Sand and Gravel Act intra vires of the Legislature of Alberta, and declaring that such Act \"is and was retroactive and applicable to the issues between the present parties\". On November 26, 1951, the Appellate Division granted special leave to appeal to this Court.\nThe unanimous judgment of the Apellate Division was delivered by the learned Chief Justice of Alberta, who first examined the matter without regard to The Sand and Gravel Act and reached the conclusion that on the evidence and the authorities, apart altogether from the provisions of the last-mentioned Statute, the judgment at trial should be reversed. The learned Chief Justice then considered the Statute and held that it was decisive in favour of the defendants.\nI am in respectful agreement with the Appellate Division as to the effect of the Statute. In my opinion, The Sand and Gravel Act is declaratory of the law. A consideration of all its provisions indicates an intention not to alter the law but to declare what, in the view of the Legislature, it is and always has been. In Blackstone's Commentaries, Volume 1, on page 86, that learned author says:\u2014\nStatutes also are either declaratory of the common law, or remedial of some defects therein. Declaratory, where the old custom of the Kingdom is almost fallen into disuse, or become disputable; in which case the Parliament has thought proper, in perpetuum rei testimonium, and for avoiding all doubts and difficulties, to declare what the common law is and ever has been. In Craies on. Statute Law, 4th Edition at pages 60 and 61 it is said:\u2014\nFor modern purposes a declaratory act may be defined as an act passed to remove doubts existing as to the common law, or the meaning or effect of any statute. Such acts are usually held to be retrospective. The usual reason for passing a declaratory act is to set aside what Parliament deems to have been a judicial error, whether in the statement of the common law or in the interpretation of statutes.\nIt is true that the word \"declared\" is not found in the statute, but there are many other indicia of the intention of the Legislature. In the preamble there is a recital of the judgment of the learned trial judge, of the doubts and uncertainties as to the ownership of sand and gravel in the Province resulting therefrom and of the desirability of resolving these doubts and uncertainties. Then it is enacted (by ss. 2 and 3) in regard to all lands in the Province that \"the owner of the surface of land is and shall be deemed at all times to have been the owner of and entitled to all sand and gravel on the surface of that land and all sand and gravel obtained by stripping off the overburden, excavating from the surface, or otherwise recovered by surface operations\".\nS. 4(1) of the Act may not be strictly necessary. It is the corollary of s. 3 and reads:\u2014\nThe sand and gravel referred to in section 3 shall not be deemed to be a mine, mineral or valuable stone but shall be deemed to be and to have been a part of the surface of land and to belong to the owner thereof.\nThe words in s. 3:\u2014\"is and shall be deemed at all times to have been\" and those in s. 4(1):\u2014\"shall be deemed to be and to have been\" appear to me, in the words of Black-stone quoted above, to declare what the law \"is and ever has been\".\nWith all respect to Mr. Riley's argument on this point, I think it clear that the word \"deemed\" as used in this Statute means \"conclusively presumed\". To construe it as meaning \"deemed, prima facie, until the contrary is shewn\" would be to revive those doubts and uncertainties which it was the expressed intention of the Legislature to remove. There is, of course, no doubt of the general rule that unless the intention of the Legislature collected from the words of the Statute is clear and unequivocal we are to presume that an act is prospective and not retrospective. As it is put in the well-known maxim:\u2014\"Omnis nova constitutio futuris formam imponere debet non praeteritis\". But it has often been held that where an act is in its nature declaratory the presumption against construing it retrospectively is inapplicable. (vide Craies on Statute Law op. cit. p. 341 and cases there cited).\nHaving concluded that the Act is declaratory of what is and has always been the law of Alberta in this regard, I do not find it necessary to decide whether, under the applicable Statutes and rules of Alberta, an appeal to the Appellate Division is\u2014to use the words of Duff J., as he then was, in Boulevard Heights v. Veilleux 18 \u2014\"an appeal strictly so-called, not an appeal by way of re-hearing\"; for even assuming it to be so, I think it clear that the Appellate Division would be bound to give effect to a Statute, passed after the judgment from which the appeal is taken but before the hearing or decision of the appeal, declaring what the law is and always has been and so, of necessity, declaring what it was at the time of the trial. This proposition appears to me to be so obvious as not to require authority to support it but if authority is needed it is, I think, to be found in the following passages in the judgments in Boulevard Heights v. Veilleux (supra):\u2014 per Duff J. (as he then was) at pages 191 and 192:\u2014\nThere can be no doubt, I think, that if these amendments had been enacted before the hearing of the appeal by the Appellate Division of Alberta, that court would have been governed by them in the disposition of the appeal. The question we have to consider is another question. The Legislature of Alberta has no authority to prescribe rules governing this court in the disposition of appeals from Alberta; and the enactments invoked by Mr. Clarke, which do not profess to declare the state of the law at the time the action was brought, or at the time the judgment of the Appellate Division was given, can only affect the rights of the parties on this appeal to the extent to which the statutes and rules by which this court is governed permit them so to operate.\nper Anglin J. (as he then was) at pages 193 and 194:\u2014\nIt is impossible to say that the provincial appellate court should have given effect to an amendment of the statute law which was not in force when it rendered judgment. Nor can an amendment not declaratory in its nature, such as was that dealt with in Corporation of Quebec v. Dunbar, 19 ited by Mr. Clarke, enable us to say that the law was at the date of the judgment appealed from what the subsequent amendment has made it.\nper Brodeur J. at page 196:\u2014\nIf it was a declaratory law that had been passed by the provincial legislature, of course we would be bound by it.\nIn K.V.P. v. McKie et al 20 This Court, applying the [principles stated in Boulevard Heights v. Veilleux (supra), declined to give effect to an Ontario statute passed after the date of the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario from which the appeal was brought. Kerwin J., who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court said, at page 701:\u2014\nThe 1949 Act is not an enactment declaratory of what the law was deemed to be.\nThe case of Eyre v. Wynn-Mackenzie 21 relied upon by counsel for the appellants is distinguishable. In that case judgment had been given, and the time for appealing had expired before the passing of the Act there in question. An application was made to extend the time for appealing so as to enable the appellant to have the benefit of the provisions of such Act. In refusing leave Lindley L. J., speaking for the Court of Appeal, said:\u2014\nIf we give leave to appeal in this case, we should be re-opening all judgments of a similar kind which had been given prior to the passing of the Act. We cannot do that.\nIn my opinion the law is correctly stated in the following passage in Craies on Statute Law (op. cit.) at page 341, provided the words \"cases pending\" are understood as including actions in which, while judgment has been given, an appeal from such judgment is pending at the date of the declaratory act coming into force:\u2014\nActs of this kind, (i.e., declaratory acts), like judgments, decide like cases pending when the judgments are given, but do not re-open decided cases.\nFor the appellants reliance was placed on the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Beauharnois Light, Heat and Power Co. Ltd. v. The Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario et al 22, and particularly the following passages in the judgment of Middleton J. A. who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal :\u2014\nThe rights of the parties had already passed into judgment, and the legislation has no effect upon this action. It is true the legislation was passed and was in effect when the appeal was heard in this Court, but the duty of an appellate Court is to reconsider the case and to correct any error made, in its opinion, by the trial Judge, and to pronounce the judgment that, in its opinion, the trial Judge ought to have pronounced: see Ontario Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1927, ch. 88, sec. 26.\n. . .\nThe intention of the Legislature is embodied in the formal Act of Parliament and can only be gathered from the words used in that enactment. The Legislature, in matters within its competence, is unquestionably supreme, but it falls to the Courts to determine the meaning of the language used. If the Courts do not determine in accordance with the true intention of the Legislature, the Legislature cannot arrogate to itself the jurisdiction of a further appellate Court and enact that the language used in its earlier enactment means something other than the Court has determined. It can, if it so pleases, use other language expressing its meaning more clearly. It transcends its true function when it undertakes to say that the language used has a different meaning and effect to that given it by the Courts, and that it always has meant something other than the Courts have declared it to mean. Very plainly is this so when, as in this case, the declaratory Act was not passed until after the original Act had been construed, and judgment pronounced.\nTo understand what was before the Court in the Beauharnois case it is necessary to refer shortly to the facts. In 1935 the Ontario Legislature had passed an Act (c. 53) providing that a number of contracts to which The Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario was a party \"are hereby declared to be and always to have been illegal, void and unenforceable as against the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario\" and further providing that:\u2014\nNo action or other proceeding shall be brought, maintained or proceeded with against the said Commission founded upon any contract by this Act declared to be void and unenforceable, or arising out of the performance or non-performance of any of the terms of the said contracts;\nS. 6(4) of The Power Commission Act of Ontario, R.S.O. 1927, c. 57, read as follows:\u2014\nWithout the consent of the Attorney-General, no action shall be brought against the Commission or against any member thereof for anything done or omitted in the exercise of his office.\nIn the earlier case of Ottawa Valley Power Co. v. The Hydro-Electric Power Commission 23, which arose under the same statute, the Court of Appeal had held that the substantive enactment declaring void the contracts in question in that action was ultra vires of the Legislature because it assumed to destroy civil rights outside the Province and that the Legislature could not, by enactment of adjectival law, preclude the courts of Ontario from so declaring.\nIn the Beauharnois case Rose C. J. H. C. delivered judgment on January 13, 1937, following the Ottawa Valley Power Co. case. An appeal was heard in April, 1937. In the meantime on January 29, 1937, c. 58 of the Ontario Statutes of 1937, I Geo. VI was enacted as follows:\u2014\nThe meaning and effect of subsec. 4 of sec. 6 of The Power Commission Act is and always has been that without the consent of the Attorney-General no action of any kind whatsoever shall be brought against The Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, and that without the consent of the Attorney-General no action of any kind whatsoever shall be brought against any member of The Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario for anything done or omitted by him in the exercise of his office.\nIt was to this enactment that the passages quoted above from the judgment of Middleton J. A. were directed.\nWith the greatest respect, it seems to me that this enactment was merely a further attempt by enacting adjectival law to preclude the Courts from declaring that a substantive enactment of the Legislature was beyond its powers and was therefore rightly held ineffectual. If and insofar as the judgment in the Beauharnois case negatives the power of the Legislature to declare the law, retrospectively or otherwise, in regard to matters entirely within the ambit of its constitutional powers it ought not to be followed. The question of the constitutional validity of The Sand and Gravel Act was disposed of adversely to the appellants at the hearing of the appeal, and consequently I do not think that they are assisted by the judgment in the Beauharnois case.\nI would dismiss the appeals for the reasons given above and would not have found it necessary to examine the other ground upon which the judgment of the Appellate Division proceeds if it were not for Mr. Riley's submission that if the appeals should be decided against his clients solely on the basis of The Sand and Gravel Act the costs in the courts below should be borne by the respondents. In view of this submission I have considered the matter without regard to the provisions of the last-mentioned Statute and find myself in agreement with the reasons of my brother Kellock on this aspect of the case. I therefore do not think that the order as to costs made by the Appellate Division should be varied.\nIn the result the appeals should be dismissed. The respondents are entitled to their costs in this Court. While we are indebted to Mr. Ross, who appeared for the intervenant, for a most helpful argument, I do not think that the appellants should be ordered to pay costs to his client. There will therefore be no order as to the costs of the intervenant.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Macleod, Riley, McDermid, Bessemer & Dixon.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Morrow & Morrow.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General of Alberta: R. J. Wilson.\nSolicitors for the Intervenant: Lavell and Ross.\n1 (1951) 3 W.W.R. (N.S.) 434.\n2 (1951) 1 W.W.R.

Thereafter the Crown served notice under s. 575C (4) (b) that at the trial he would \"be charged with being a habitual criminal.\" Following his conviction on the 1st charge the trial judge without giving him a further opportunity to elect, proceeded to inquire and found him to be a habitual criminal and sentenced him to a term of five years on the 1st charge, and directed that as a habitual criminal he be detained in prison, as provided by s. 575B, for an indefinite period. The accused appealed from the sentence imposed on the charge of being a habitual criminal, on the ground that it was a charge of a criminal offence on which he had a right of election which had not been granted him and in the alternative, that if such a charge was not a charge of a criminal offence it so materially affected the punishment which might be imposed that he was entitled to notice of the habitual criminal proceedings before being called upon to elect as to the mode of trial on the substantive offence. The appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, O'Halloran J.A. dissenting.\nHeld: 1. By the majority of the Court (Locke and Cartwright JJ. expressing no opinion) that the allegation of being a habitual criminal is not an offence within the meaning of the Criminal Code. Rex v. Hunter [1921] 1 K.B. 555, followed.\n2. (Cartwright J. dissenting): That the right of election restricted by Part XVIII to certain indictable offences, does not extend to such an allegation.\nPer: Estey J. Part XVIII restricts the right to an election to certain indictable offences. The addition of a charge of being a habitual criminal, after the required notice, does not become a part of the offence or crime charged in the indictment. There is, therefore, no right within the meaning of the provisions of the said Part, to a further election upon the crime as charged, when a charge of being a habitual criminal is added to the indictment. Rex v. Robinson [1951] S.C.R. 522, distinguished.\nPer: Locke J.\u2014Whether the charge laid under Part X(A) is of a criminal offence or merely the first step in an enquiry as to the accused's status or condition, as suggested in Hunter's case, no question of right of election arises. The very terms of Part X(A) exclude the provisions relating to election contained in Part XVIII.\nPer: Fauteux J.\u2014 Rex v. Robinson has no application. The whole matter being one of sentence, as was decided in Hunter's case, is one beyond the field of election which is strictly related to the trial of an indictable offence as to which the right of election is given and has nothing to do with sentence.\nPer: Cartwright J., dissenting\u2014It is not necessary to determine whether a charge of being a habitual criminal under Part X(A) is a charge of a criminal offence. On the hypothesis that it is not, its addition to the charge sheet had the effect of changing the charge upon which the accused made his election to one different in substance, with the result that the appellant never elected to be tried on the charge on which he was tried. Rex v. Armitage [1939] O.R. 417, applied. No notice was conveyed to the appellant that if he elected trial by a judge on the first charge he would at the same time be giving up his right to have a jury determine the question whether or not he was a habitual criminal.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia (O'Halloran J.A. dissenting) [1], which dismissed an appeal from a conviction on a speedy trial by Grimmett J., County Court Judge, on a charge of being a habitual criminal. J. L. Farris, Q.C. for the appellant.\nL. H. Jackson for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the Court of Appeal erred in failing to quash the conviction, because the accused should have been given an opportunity of electing as to how he wished to be tried on the charge of being an habitual criminal.\nOn February 5, 1952, the appellant was tried in County Court Judge's Criminal Court, New Westminster, B.C., on the original charge of breaking and entering and convicted and sentenced to five years imprisonment. Immediately thereafter the appellant was proceeded against as an habitual criminal and witnesses were heard, whereupon the learned trial judge found the accused to be an habitual criminal and ordered that he be detained for an indeterminate period in prison.\nThe wording of the various sub-sections of s. 575 of The Criminal Code of Canada are copied almost verbatim from the English Statute (Prevention of Crime Act, 1908, c. 59) whereunder proceedings against habitual criminals have been in effect for a number of years in England. The Court of Appeal followed the English decision in Rex v. Hunter [2], wherein the matter raised by the present appellant is fully discussed. In that case the judgment of the Court was delivered by the Earl of Reading C.J. and at p. 559 he said, inter alia:\u2014\nIn my judgment the whole question depends upon whether the charge against the appellant was a charge of an offence or crime or whether it merely asserted a status or condition in him which would enable the court if it were established to deal with him in a certain manner. We are of opinion that Mr. Oliver's argument on his behalf is sound, and that there is nothing in the Act which would justify us in saying that the charge of being a habitual criminal is a charge of a crime or offence.\nAnd again at p. 560:\u2014\nIf one turns to s. 10, the object of the Legislature is shown by reference to sub-s. 1\u2014namely, to enable the court to pass a further sentence if the accused is found to be a habitual criminal. That seems to me to be the key to the question, and to show that the Act intended to empower the Court, not to convict of another offence, but to pass a further sentence. That shows that Parliament was not creating a new offence. The majority of the Court appealed from relied on that decision, O'Halloran J.A. dissenting.\nThe wording of the sections in question (575 (a) to 575 (g)) are all indicative of their meaning. Section 575 (b) is as follows:\u2014\nWhere a person is convicted of an indictable offence committed after the commencement of this Part and subsequently the offender admits that he is or is found by a jury or a judge to be a habitual criminal, and the court passes a sentence upon the said offender, the court, if it is of the opinion that, by reason of his criminal habits and mode of life, it is expedient for the protection of the public, may pass a further sentence ordering that he be detained in a prison for an indeterminate period and such detention is hereinafter referred to as preventive detention and the person on whom such a sentence is passed shall be deemed for the purpose of this Part to be a habitual criminal.\nThere can be no question that an enactment of that kind was within the competency of the Canadian Parliament, since the criminal law in its widest sense is reserved for its exclusive authority (A.G. for Ontario v. Hamilton Street Ry. [3]; Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. A.G. for Canada [4].\nAdopting the language of the Earl of Reading, the sections of The Criminal Code referred to were \"not creating a new offence\", but just enabling the court to pass a further sentence if the accused was found to be a habitual criminal.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nESTEY, J.:\u2014The appellant contends that an accused who, following his election, has been tried and found guilty of an indictable offence before a judge presiding under Part XVIII (Speedy Trials of Indictable Offences) of The Criminal Code has the right, before being charged as a habitual criminal under Part X(A), to make an election as to whether he will be tried upon that charge before a judge or a judge with a jury.\nThe appellant and two others were committed for trial upon a charge that they jointly did break, enter and steal (hereinafter referred to as the crime). They elected for a speedy trial before a judge under Part XVIII. Thereafter on December 19, 1951, the Crown served a notice under s. 575C(4) (b) that at the trial the appellant would \"be charged with being a habitual criminal.\" The learned trial judge, on February 5, 1952, found all three guilty of the crime and forthwith, without giving appellant a further opportunity to elect, proceeded to inquire and find him to be a habitual criminal. He accordingly directed that the appellant be detained in prison for an indeterminate period as provided under s. 575B.\nIf being a habitual criminal is an indictable offence it would seem that the provisions of s. 834 would be applicable and, though the charge of an offence other than that upon which the accused had been committed may be included in the indictment under the proviso of that section (834), the prisoner should not be tried thereon without his consent or, in other words, without an election to be so tried.\nThe question, therefore, arises is being a habitual criminal an offence? The provisions with respect to habitual criminals were first enacted and made a part of our Criminal Code in 1947. Parliament then enacted, as part X(A) of the Criminal Code, provisions respecting habitual criminals and in doing so adopted the principle underlying and much of the language of Part II of the English Prevention of Crime Act, 1908 (8 Edw. VII, c. 59). Section 575B reads as follows:\n575B. Where a person is convicted of an indictable offence committed after the commencement of this Part and subsequently the offender admits that he is or is found by a jury or a judge to be a habitual criminal, and the court passes a sentence upon the said offender, the court, if it is of the opinion that, by reason of his criminal habits and mode of life, it is expedient for the protection of the public, may pass a further sentence ordering that he be detained in a prison for an indeterminate period and such detention is hereinafter referred to as preventive detention and the person on whom such a sentence is passed shall be deemed for the purpose of this Part to be a habitual criminal.\nSection 575C reads as follows:\n575C. (1) A person shall not be found to be a habitual criminal unless the judge or jury as the case may be, finds on evidence,\n(a) that since attaining the age of eighteen years he has at least three times previously to the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment, been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to at least five years' imprisonment, whether any such previous conviction was before or after the commencement of this Part, and that he is leading persistently a criminal life; or\n(b) that he has on a previous conviction been found to be a habitual criminal and sentenced to preventive detention.\n(2) In any indictment under this section it shall be sufficient, after charging the crime, to state that the offender is a habitual criminal. Parliament does not in these which may be referred to as the substantive sections of Part X(A) describe being a habitual criminal as an offence. This in itself is most significant and, with respect, I think the other language used supports the view that Parliament did not intend being a habitual criminal should be an offence.\nIt will be observed that under s. 575B one who is found to be a habitual criminal will be detained as such only when the court \"is of the opinion that, by reason of his criminal habits and mode of life, it is expedient for the protection of the public\" that he should be detained. If Parliament had intended that being a habitual criminal was an offence it would, in all probability, have treated it the same as all other offences and directed that sentence be passed and detention ordered or suspended as the court might determine upon the offence being established.\nThen again under s. 575C an accused must first be found guilty of an indictable offence. If, then, he admits, or evidence is adduced, that he has been three times previously convicted of indictable offences for which a penalty of at least five years might have been imposed and he is \"leading persistently a criminal life,\" he may be found to be a habitual criminal and a further sentence may then be passed if, as provided in s. 575B, the court is of the opinion that for the protection of the public an indeterminate period of preventive detention should be directed. It is not penal servitude that Parliament has in mind, but rather, as expressed, preventive detention. Penal servitude has for its object both punishment and example. Punishment, so far as the habitual criminal is concerned, has failed. Parliament now provides for his preventive detention.\nThe significance of the phrase \"preventive detention,\" as used in s. 575B, is further emphasized by s. 575G (2) under which he may be confined in a prison or that part of a prison set apart for the purpose. The intent and purpose of Parliament in passing Part X(A) was to protect the public by placing in preventive detention one who was found to be a habitual criminal and, while so detained, that he be subject \"to such disciplinary and reformative treatment as may be prescribed by prison regulations\" (575G(3)). Parliament, during the period of his detention, places upon the Minister of Justice the responsibility, once at least in every three years, to review his condition, history and circumstances with a view to determining whether he should be placed out on licence and, if so, in what conditions (575H).\nIt was necessary that Parliament should provide a procedure whereby a person may be found a habitual criminal and it was but to be expected that in the circumstances it would be substantially the same as that in respect of indictable offences. It directs that one accused of being a habitual criminal shall be tried on a charge (575C(4)). The indictment shall first set forth the crime and it will be sufficient if there be added thereto a statement that the offender is a habitual criminal (575C(2)). He will first be \"arraigned only on so much of the indictment as charges the crime\" (575C(3)). If he be found not guilty of the crime that is an end to the proceeding. If he be found guilty of the crime then the court will direct its attention to determining whether he is a habitual criminal. This finding shall be upon evidence (575C(1)). If he be convicted of being a habitual criminal and sentenced to preventive detention he may appeal. If being a habitual criminal was an indictable offence the following words of s. 575E \"the provisions of this Act relating to an appeal from a conviction for an indictable offence shall be applicable thereto\" would be unnecessary. It is true that throughout Part X(A) the words \"charge,\" \"arraignment,\" \"sentence\" and \"conviction\" are used, but it will be noted that these are all in relation to the procedure and are not, therefore, indicative of a conclusion leading to the designation of being a habitual criminal as an offence.\nCounsel for the appellant seeks to draw some analogy between the position of a habitual criminal and one charged with vagrancy. Vagrancy is described as an offence and is in all respects treated as other offences. There does, however, appear to be some analogy between the treatment in the court of a habitual criminal and one who, charged with an offence, has been found to be insane either at the time the offence was committed or at the time of his trial. In both cases the provisions are to the effect that such person is not permitted at large, but is detained in a mental hospital or other institution to await the pleasure of the Lieutenant-Governor. It would be contrary to public interest to permit such a person to be at large until at least that is deemed safe by competent authority. In like manner it is deemed unsafe, from the point of view of the public, that one who is a habitual criminal should be at large and, therefore, he should be detained subject to the direction of the Minister of Justice.\nIn Rex v. Hunter[5], a decision under the English statute, it was held that being a habitual criminal is not an offence. Counsel for the appellant submitted that decision was either distinguishable or ought not to be applied to the provisions of Part X(A) because of the difference in our legislation. He points out that in England the inquiry can only be before a jury and, therefore, no election ever takes place. That, however, is a matter of procedure or mode of trial and does not affect the substantive provisions. Parliament, in defining the term \"judge\" in Part X(A), expressly contemplated that the inquiry as to whether a person is a habitual criminal would be made both by a judge presiding under Part XVIII and any judge having criminal jurisdiction in the province.\nCounsel also emphasized the difference in language between s. 11 of the English Act and the corresponding s. 575E of the Canadian Act dealing with the matter of an appeal. In the former the language is \"a person sentenced to preventive detention may\u2026\" while in the Canadian Act it reads \"a person convicted and sentenced to preventive detention may\u2026\" The word \"convicted\" in s. 575E does not add anything and is, as already stated, in relation to procedure and in any event it does not override the general intention of Parliament.\nSection 13 of the English Act and s. 575G of the Canadian Act are different in this sense that under the English Act the sentence of preventive detention takes effect immediately on the termination of the sentence of penal servitude, while under the Canadian Act it takes effect immediately on the conviction of a person on a charge that he is a habitual criminal. Here again this does not assist in determining whether being a habitual criminal is an offence within the meaning of the Criminal Code. Counsel for the Crown adopts the language of Mr. Justice O'Halloran that even if being a habitual criminal is not an offence \"nevertheless Parliament has mandatorily stipulated it shall be dealt with by the courts in the same manner (with one or two exceptions) as if it were an indictable offence.\" The learned judge, therefore, concludes that \"Whether being a habitual criminal is a criminal offence or not the right to elect for trial still remains an essential statutory requirement.\"\nIt must be conceded that, as already stated, the words \"charge,\" \"arraignment,\" \"sentence\" and \"conviction\" appear throughout the part and under s. 575E, if an appeal is taken, the procedure therein will be that applicable to an indictable offence. These are all relative to procedure and as such do not affect or indicate the substantive nature of being a habitual criminal as an offence. In fact, as already pointed out, the provision relative to an appeal would be unnecessry if it were an indictable offence.\nWhat is more significant is that even in the indictment it is sufficient \"to state that the offender is a habitual criminal\" (575C(2)) and this statement can be added only after \"not less than seven days' notice\" (575C(4) (b)). Parliament, in the same Part X(A), in s. 575A, provides that the word \"judge\" means a judge acting under Part XVIII of this Act and any judge having criminal jurisdiction in the province. It is, therefore, clear that Parliament had in mind an election and the procedure in reference thereto and it must follow that, in providing for seven days' notice, had it intended being a habitual criminal was an additional offence, it would, not having so described it, have directed that s. 834 would apply.\nMoreover, ss. 825, 826 and 834 make it clear that Parliament intended the provisions for an election should only apply in certain indictable offences. Being a habitual criminal is not an offence. A charge that an accused is a habitual criminal is added to an indictment for an offence. Though Parliament in this sense contemplated that it should be a part of the indictment, it does not thereby become a part of the offence charged in the indictment. This is made clear by the provisions which require that the accused shall first be arraigned and tried for the offence. Then only if he be guilty of that offence will the court direct its attention to the issue as to his being a habitual criminal and, if so, should there be directed an indeteminate period of preventive detention. Throughout the proceeding the offence or crime charged is treated in every respect, even as to punishment, as separate and distinct from being a habitual criminal. With great respect to those who entertain a contrary opinion, Part XVIII restricts the right to an election to certain indictable offences. The addition of a charge of being a habitual criminal, after the required notice, does not become a part of the offence or crime charged in the indictment. There is, therefore, no right, within the meaning of the provisions of Part XVIII, to a further election upon the crime as charged, when a charge of being a habitual criminal is added to the indictment.\nCounsel for the appellant referred particularly to the word \"offence\" as used in two of the reasons for judgment in Rex v. Robinson[6]. In that case this Court had to construe the words \"at least\" where they appear in s. 575C (1) (a) and, therefore, quite a different issue from that here to be considered, and the word there used must be read and construed in relation to that issue. When so read it does not assist counsel for the appellant in his contention.\nSection 575B of our Act is based upon and adopts much of the language of s. 10(1) of the English Act, in respect of which the Earl of Reading C.J., in Rex v. Hunter, supra, stated:\nIf one turns to s. 10, the object of the Legislature is shown by reference to sub-s. 1\u2014namely, to enable the Court to pass a further sentence if the accused is found to be a habitual criminal. That seems to me to be the key to the question, and to show that the Act intended to empower the Court, not to convict of another offence, but to pass a further sentence. That shows that Parliament was not creating a new offence.\nThese are the substantive sections and it would seem that the learned Earl has appropriately described the intent and purpose of the Parliament both of Great Britain and Canada.\nThe appeal should be dismissed. LOCKE J.:\u2014The appellant Brusch was arrested on February 26, 1951, with two persons by name Paton and Abbott, on a charge of having broken and entered certain store premises in Haney, B.C. on that date, and on this charge the accused persons were committed for trial by a magistrate. On March 19, 1951, the appellant appeared before His Honour Judge Sullivan in the County Court Judges' Criminal Court for the County of Westminster and elected to be tried by a judge, without the intervention of a jury, on such charge. While the record is silent on the point, apparently Paton and Abbott also elected to be so tried.\nOn December 19, 1951, something more than a month before the date fixed for the trial of these three persons by a judge of the County Court of New Westminster, the Crown caused to be served a notice on the present appellant, informing him that at the trial then fixed for January 23, 1952, and on any adjournment thereof he would, if convicted on the said charge,\n\"be charged with being a habitual criminal and be tried upon such charge\"\non the grounds that on three previous occasions since attaining the age of eighteen years he had been convicted of criminal offences on each of which he was liable to be sentenced to at least five years' imprisonment, and further:\nthat since the year 1940 you have been leading a persistently criminal life in that you have been an associate of criminals, prostitutes, drug addicts and have had no regular employment or occupation.\nOn the charge of breaking and entering, the appellant, together with Paton and Abbott, was tried before His Honour Judge Grimmett in the County Court Judges' Criminal Court at New Westminster on February 7, 1952 and was found guilty.\nUpon the charge sheet, following that portion which charged the three accused persons of the offence of breaking and entering, there appeared the following:\nRegina v. Lloyd Brusch. In that the said Lloyd Brusch having been convicted of the offence mentioned of breaking, entering and theft at Haney in the County of Westminster and Province of British Columbia, on the 26th day of February, A.D. 1951, is a habitual criminal.\nR. G. KELL,\nClerk of the Peace The transcript of the proceeding shows that at the conclusion of the trial on the charge of breaking and entering the further charge was read by the Registrar to the accused, who was represented by counsel, that he pleaded not guilty and that the trial proceeded forthwith. At its conclusion the learned County Court Judge reserved his judgment. On February 13, 1952 he found the appellant guilty on what was referred to as \"the habitual criminal charge.\" On the charge of breaking and entering, he sentenced the appellant to a term of five years and, finding him to be a habitual criminal, further directed that he be detained for an indefinite period in prison.\nThe appellant moved before the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal from his conviction and on the same date gave notice of his intention to appeal and both applications were dismissed by the Court of Appeal, O'Halloran J.A. dissenting, and it is from this judgment that the present appeal is taken.\nSection 575B of the Criminal Code provides that where a person is convicted of an indictable offence committed after the commencement of Part X(A) and subsequently:\u2014\nthe offender admits that he is or is found by a jury or a judge to be a habitual criminal, and the court passes a sentence upon the said offender, the court, if it is of the opinion that, by reason of his criminal habits and mode of life, it is expedient for the protection of the public, may pass a further sentence ordering that he be detained in a prison for an indeterminate period\u2026 and the person on whom such a sentence is passed shall be deemed for the purpose of this Part to be a habitual criminal.\nSection 575C provides that a person shall not be found to be a habitual criminal unless the judge or jury, as the case may be, finds on evidence that since attaining the age of eighteen years he has at least three times previously to the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment, been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to at least five years' imprisonment, and that he is leading persistently a criminal life, or that he has on a previous conviction been found to be a habitual criminal and sentenced to preventive detention. The language of s-s. 3 of this section is of importance in determining the present matter. It reads:\u2014\nIn the proceedings on the indictment the offender shall in the first instance be arraigned only on so much of the indictment as charges the crime, and if on arraignment he pleads guilty or is found guilty by the judge or jury, as the case may be, unless he thereafter pleads guilty to being a habitual criminal, the judge or jury shall be charged to enquiry whether or not he is a habitual criminal and in that case it shall not be necessary to swear the jury again.\nOf the three grounds upon which Mr. Justice O'Halloran dissented, two only were argued before us, these being that the charge of being a habitual criminal being a charge of a criminal offence the accused had a right of election, which was not granted to him, and, alternatively, if such a charge was not a charge of a criminal offence, it so materially affects the punishment that might be imposed that the accused was entitled to notice of the habitual criminal proceedings before being called upon to decide as to the mode of trial on the substantive offence.\nThe sections of the Criminal Code dealing with habitual criminals were introduced into the statute in 1947 and form Part X(A) of the Code. While not identical in terms, sections 575B and 575C follow very closely the language of s. 10 of The Prevention of Crime Act, 1908 (Imp.).\nSince under the English statute the question as to whether an accused person is a habitual criminal must be determined by the jury which tries him upon what may be called the substantive offence, no question can arise there as to a right of election.\nThe decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Hunter[7], however, deals with the question as to the nature of the proceedings. The Earl of Reading C.J. there said that the charge under s. 10 of being a habitual criminal was not a charge of an offence or crime, but rather, merely the first step in ascertaining \"a status or condition in him\" which would enable the Court, if it were established, to deal with him in a certain manner. This question was considered by the Court of Appeal in British Columbia in R. v. Robinson[8], in proceedings under Part X(A) and Robertson J.A., who delivered the judgment of the Court, followed what had been said by the Earl of Reading in Hunter's case on the question as to whether the charge of being a habitual criminal was of a substantive offence and said that:\u2014\nThe question was not one of guilt but whether under the circumstances a further sentence should be imposed. It may, however, be noted that the exact point to be decided in Robinson's case was as to whether the trial judge who presided at the hearing had the right to take judicial notice of the conviction of the prisoner for an offence against the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, which was the substantive offence charged and of which he had pleaded guilty, and to tell the jury that was empanelled to hear the habitual criminal charge that he had been so convicted. In the present appeal, the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia, in delivering the judgment of the majority of the Court, expressed the view that the sections related to sentence only and that the Court's decision in Robinson's case should be followed.\nThere is much to be said for the contrary view, in my opinion. Sub-s. 4 of s. 575C refers to the statement on the indictment that the offender is a habitual criminal as a charge upon which no person shall be tried, unless the Attorney-General of the Province consents and not less than seven days' notice has been given to the offender specifying the grounds upon which it is intended to found the charge. Sub-s. (a) provides that a person shall not be found to be a habitual criminal unless the judge or jury, as the case may be, finds on evidence that, in addition to having been three times previously, since attaining the age of eighteen years, convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to at least five years' imprisonment, he is leading persistently a criminal life. This was the charge that the learned County Court Judge was required to consider in the present matter. Upon evidence which he considered to be sufficient, he found Brusch to be a habitual criminal and so, if he considered it to be expedient for the protection of the public, liable to be detained in prison for an indeterminate period. O'Halloran J.A. points out in his dissenting judgment that s. 238 of The Criminal Code defines a course of conduct rendering a person liable to conviction and sentence for the offence of vagrancy. Part X(A) defines the course of conduct which renders a person liable to conviction as a habitual criminal. If one is properly described as a criminal offence, why not the other? I have, however, come to the conclusion that whether the charge laid under Part X(A) is of a criminal offence or merely the first step in an enquiry as to the accused person's status or condition, as suggested in Hunter's case, no question of a right of election arises and that this appeal should fail.\nIn my opinion, Part X(A) defines in its entirety the procedure to be followed in disposing of charges of this nature. Under s. 575(3) the offender is first arraigned on so much of the indictment as charges the crime, in this case that of breaking and entering. If he is tried on that offence by a judge alone, as in the present case, it is the judge who, having found the accused guilty and passed sentence upon him, is \"charged to enquire\" whether or not he was a habitual criminal. Had he been tried on the offence of breaking and entering by a jury and found guilty, that jury would have been charged with the duty of determining the habitual criminal charge. In the present case, since Part X(A) named the tribunal which was to hear and determine the habitual criminal charge, there was no option to offer the prisoner as to the manner in which he would be tried. The very terms of Part X(A) exclude, in my opinion, the provisions relating to election contained in Part XVIII of the Code.\nIt has been said during the argument of the present matter that it is a hardship upon an accused person to be deprived of the right to elect the tribunal before which a charge of this grave nature is to be heard, on which he may be found liable to be imprisoned for life. That, however, is a matter for Parliament and not for the courts. The question, moreover, as to whether this works a hardship upon such an accused person is debatable. At the time the present appellant elected to take a speedy trial on the charge of breaking and entering, he must be held to have been aware that since he had been convicted three times since he was eighteen years of age of offences of the character described in Part X(A) and had been leading persistently a criminal life, he might be charged under the provisions of that Part with being a habitual criminal and to have considered this in electing for a speedy trial.\nI would dismiss the appeal. CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia pronounced on December 19, 1952, whereby according to the formal order of that Court, \"the appeal\u2026 of the above-named Appellant from the finding of His Honour Judge J. K. Grimmett, a judge of the County Court Judge's Criminal Court for the County of Westminster, holden at New Westminster, B.C., in the said County of Westminster, on the 13th day of February, A.D. 1952, that he, the said Lloyd Brusch, is an habitual criminal\" was dismissed.\nThe appeal is based, pursuant to section 1023(1) of The Criminal Code, on the following questions of law, upon which O'Halloran J.A. dissented:\u2014\n(1) the charge of being an habitual criminal is a charge of a criminal offence on which the accused has a right of election which was not granted to the Appellant herein;\n(2) alternatively the charge of being an habitual criminal, if it is not a charge of a criminal offence, so materially affects the punishment that may be imposed that the accused is entitled to notice of the habitual criminal proceedings before being called upon to elect as to the mode of trial on the substantive offence;\n(3) in the further alternative if the charge of being an habitual criminal is not a charge of a criminal offence but a matter in respect of status, then it is legislation in respect to a non-criminal matter and the Parliament of Canada has no jurisdiction to legislate with respect thereto.\nNo argument was addressed to us in regard to the third ground of dissent, and I therefore propose to deal only with the first two questions above set out.\nThe facts are as follows. The appellant was arrested on February 26, 1951 and was charged jointly with two others with breaking and entering a store with intent to steal. The three were committed for trial. On March 19, 1951, the three accused elected a speedy trial pursuant to the provisions of Part XVIII of the Criminal Code and the trial was set for the 28th of May. On that date and on several subsequent dates the three accused appeared and the trial was further adjourned and finally commenced on February 5, 1952.\nNo objection is taken to the form of the statement in writing, prepared pursuant to section 827(3) of the Code, insofar as it relates to the charge of breaking and entering. This statement is signed \"R. G. Kell\", Clerk of the Peace. Below this signature appears the following:\u2014\nRegina v. Lloyd Brusch\nFor that the said Lloyd Brusch, having been convicted of the above mentioned offence of breaking, entering and theft at Haney in the County of Westminster and Province of British Columbia, on the 26th day of February A.D. 1951, is a habitual criminal.\nR. G. KELL,\nClerk of the Peace\nCode Sec. 575 C (2)\nThe record is silent as to when the last mentioned addition was placed on the charge sheet but it is clear that it was not mentioned or in any way brought to the notice of the accused or his counsel at the time he elected to be tried before a judge without the intervention of a jury. On December 19, 1951 an undated notice addressed to the appellant was served upon him, stating that if convicted on the breaking and entering charge he would \"be charged with being an habitual criminal and be tried upon such charge on the following grounds, namely\u2026\". The notice sufficiently sets out the grounds upon which it was intended to found the charge.\nThe trial on the charge of breaking and entering was held on the 5th and 7th days of February 1952. At the conclusion of the trial the appellant and the other two accused were found guilty and immediately thereafter counsel for the Crown asked the Clerk of the Court to read the charge against the appellant of being a habitual criminal. The Clerk of the Court read the charge. The appellant, who was represented by counsel, was called upon to plead. He pleaded \"not guilty\" and the hearing proceeded. At the conclusion of the hearing the learned trial judge reserved his judgment until February 13 to which date he remanded the accused. On February 13 he delivered judgment orally, saying in part:\u2014\"On the habitual criminal trial charge I have come to the conclusion that you are guilty as charged\u2026 therefore I sentence you to be detained for an indeterminate period in prison.\" On the charge of breaking and entering the learned trial judge sentenced the appellant to five years imprisonment. No appeal was taken from the last mentioned conviction and sentence. From the above recital of facts it is clear that the appellant was given no opportunity of electing as to how the question whether he was a habitual criminal should be determined, that is to say, whether it should be by a judge under Part XVIII of The Criminal Code or by a jury. The contention of counsel for the respondent is that in any case in which an accused has been charged with an indictable offence falling with section 825(1) of the Code and has properly elected to be tried on such charge by a judge under Part XVIII, it is open to the prosecuting officer to make an addition to the charge sheet stating, pursuant to section 575C(2), that the accused is a habitual criminal, and that, without any further election by the accused, the judge trying the indictable offence has jurisdiction to try the further question whether or not the accused is a habitual criminal.\nThe Crown relies on the case of Rex v. Hunter[9], a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. In that case the appellant \"was indicted at the London Sessions for office breaking and larceny and also for being a habitual criminal.\" The jury convicted him on the charge of office breaking and larceny. Before the charge of being a habitual criminal, which the appellant denied, was gone into he asked for an adjournment to enable him to call a witness who was not present. After discussion the Deputy Chairman adjourned the trial of the question whether the accused was a habitual criminal to the following sessions and in the meanwhile sentenced the accused to three years penal servitude on the charge of office breaking. The sole ground of appeal appears to have been that on a proper interpretation of The Prevention of Crime Act, 1908 8 Edw. VII, c. 59, which is in its wording similar to, although by no means identical with, Part X(A) of the Criminal Code, where in addition to a substantive charge a charge is made that the accused is a habitual criminal the last mentioned charge must be tried by the same jury that tries the substantive charge.\nThat point had already been dealt with by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Jennings [10]and in delivering the judgment of the Court in Rex v. Hunter (supra) the Earl of Reading C.J. said, in part:\u2014\"The only ques- tion remaining is whether Parliament has altered the law since the decision in Rex v. Jennings.\" I do not read Rex v. Jennings as necessarily deciding that the charge of being a habitual criminal is not a charge of a crime or offence but there is no doubt that in Rex v. Hunter the Court did so decide, and, while it was not necessary to the decision, a court of thirteen judges, presided over by Hewart L.C.J. in Rex v. Norman[11], appears to approve the decision in Hunter's case. It would seem, therefore, that it must be taken to be established in England that the charge of being a habitual criminal is not a charge of an offence or crime but is merely an assertion of the existence of a status or condition in the accused which would enable the Court, if it were established, to deal with him in a certain manner.\nI am much impressed by the reasons given by O'Halloran J.A. in his dissenting judgment in the case at bar for reaching a result on the construction of Part X(A) of the Code different from that which was reached on the construction of the Act under consideration in the Hunter case but I do not think it is necessary, in this appeal, to finally determine whether a charge of being a habitual criminal under Part X(A) of the Code is a charge of a crime or of an offence. If it is, as O'Halloran J.A. considers it to be, then clearly the learned trial judge had no jurisdiction to deal with the charge as the appellant had not elected to be tried by him. If, however, the alternative view is accepted, i.e. that the statement added to the indictment or charge sheet, pursuant to s. 575C(2), is not a charge of an offence, then I respectfully agree with O'Halloran J.A. that an election by the appellant was nonetheless an essential condition precedent to the judge acquiring jurisdiction to determine, without the intervention of a jury, the question, whether the accused was or was not a habitual criminal.\nOn the hypothesis that the statement added to the charge sheet stating the appellant to be a habitual criminal was not the charge of an offence, in my opinion that addition had the effect of changing the charge upon which the appellant had made his election to one different in substance, with the result that the appellant never elected to be tried by the learned judge on the charge on which he was tried. In Rex v. Armitage [12], the circumstances dealt with were different from those in the case at bar but I think that case rightly decides that a change in an indictment which makes it possible to impose a longer term of imprisonment in the event of conviction cannot be regarded as an amendment in matter of form only. When, pursuant to s. 827 of the Code, the judge stated to the appellant that he was charged with an offence, he described only the offence of breaking and entering and no notice of any sort was conveyed to the appellant that if he elected trial by a judge on that charge he would at the same time be giving up his right to have a jury determine the question whether or not he was a habitual criminal.\nIt is obvious that an accused might be moved to electtrial by a judge on a substantive charge by considerations different from those which would weigh with him in deciding what tribunal should decide whether he was a habitual criminal. He might know that he was guilty of the substantive charge but be convinced, in his own mind, that he was not a habitual criminal. He might be willing to be tried without a jury for an offence as to which he knew the maximum penalty, but desire a jury to pass upon a question the adverse determination of which could result in his being deprived of his liberty for the rest of his life.\nI can find no provision in the Code giving jurisdiction to a judge to determine without the intervention of a jury whether an accused is a habitual criminal, without the accused's consent, given after being informed that the question, or one of the questions, to be determined is whether he is a habitual criminal.\nI can derive little assistance from the sections of the Code dealing with the method of specifying in an indictment or charge sheet that an accused who is charged with a substantive offence has been previously convicted. The only questions in such a case, in regard to the previous conviction, are those of historical fact and identity. The question whether or not a person is a habitual criminal involves an inquiry going much further afield, the nature of which is fully discussed in the judgment of the Lord Chief Justice in Rex v. Norman (supra). In my view the charge or statement that a person is a habitual criminal must be regarded as either (i) a substantive charge of an offence, or (ii) the allegation of the existence of a condition in a person accused of an indictable offence (conveniently referred to as a substantive offence) by reason of which such person if found guilty of the substantive offence may suffer detention for an indeterminate period in addition to any punishment imposed for the substantive offence, and therefore a substantial ingredient of the indictment charging the substantive offence. If the former is the right view, the question raised in this appeal presents no difficulty; but if the latter view is preferred then for the reasons given above I am of opinion that there was no proper election by the accused to be tried under Part XVIII.\nIf the construction of the relevant sections of the Code were difficult or doubtful the Court should adopt that construction which does not deprive an accused of the right to have tried by a jury a question which may involve his losing his liberty for the rest of his life. The power of Parliament to take away the right to trial by jury is not questioned but the intention to do so should not lightly be assumed.\nIt remains to consider the question, raised during the argument before us that the appellant can not now be heard to allege lack of jurisdiction because he pleaded to the charge before the learned trial judge without objection and did not raise the question of jurisdiction at the trial. On this point reference was made to Sayers v. The King [13]. In my opinion that case is distinguishable from the case at bar. In Sayers' case the appellants were convicted after trial by a jury. It was held that their right to elect trial and to be tried without a jury under Part XVIII of the Code, if it existed, was a privilege which could be waived and which was waived by pleading, without objection, to the arraignment before the jury. In the case at bar, in my respectful view, the consent of the accused obtained pursuant to the provisions of s. 827 of the Code was a condition precedent to the existence of jurisdiction in the learned trial judge and such consent was not obtained. For the above reasons I would allow the appeal and quash the finding that the appellant is a habitual criminal and the sentence passed upon that finding.\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014This is an appeal under s. 1023 of the Criminal Code. Of the three grounds of law, upon which there was a dissent, only the first two have to be considered, for the third one\u2014related to the constitutionality of Part XA\u2014has been abandoned by the appellant and the Attorney General for Canada was not represented at the hearing.\nIn brief, the whole matter raises a question of procedure but, as will be seen, one of substance, i.e. one of jurisdiction.\nOriginally charged with the offence of \"breaking and entering a store with intent to steal,\" the appellant, after being committed to trial for this offence, elected to be tried on the same, by a judge alone, under Part XVIII of the Criminal Code. A plea of not guilty was entered and several adjournments of the case ensued. Some two months before trial, i.e. on the 19th of December 1951, the appellant received notice that the Crown intended to proceed with a charge of being a habitual criminal and at some time before the trial, an addition, implementing this intention, was made to the formal statement in writing provided under s. 827 s-s. 3. Without a new election nor any objection being made in the matter, the trial proceeded; the appellant was found guilty of the substantive offence as to which he had elected; immediately thereafter, the secondary issue was inquired into and he was found to be a habitual criminal and sentenced as such.\nAs formulated, the first ground of law is:\u2014\nThe charge of being a habitual criminal is a charge of a criminal offence on which the accused has a right of election which was not granted to the appellant.\nThis point rests on two legal assumptions:\u2014(a) That to be a habitual criminal is a criminal offence; (b) That this offence is indictable and one for the trial of which a right to elect for a speedy trial is given.\nDealing with (a):\u2014This point never came before this Court. Our decision in Rex v. Robinson[14], relied on by counsel for the appellant, has no application. It is true that some of the members of the Court, incidentally, said that by the enactment of Part X(A), Parliament created a new offence. But besides the fact that such a dictum was not expressed by a majority of the Court, it was foreign to the issue and its determination. The question, however, came squarely before the English Criminal Court of Appeal in Hunter [15] where, having to determine the object of the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908\u2014from which Part X(A) of the Criminal Code is inspired\u2014Reading L.C.J., rendering the judgment for the Court, said at page 74:\u2014\n\u2026that to be a habitual criminal within the meaning of the statute is not a substantive offence, but is a state of circumstances affecting the prisoner which enables the court to pass a further or additional sentence to that which has been already imposed; \u2026\nAt page 73, the Lord Chief Justice says:\u2014\nTurning to s. 10 we think that the object of the legislature is clearly shown by reference to sub-s. (1). It empowers the Court to pass a further sentence if the prisoner is found to be a habitual criminal. That seems really the key of the question so much discussed today, and indicates that the Act was not intended to enable the Court to convict of another offence, but was intended to enable the Court, when the prisoner has been convicted of the substantive offence for which he is indicted and has been sentenced to at least three years' penal servitude, to pass \"a further sentence, ordering that on the determination of the sentence of penal servitude,\" he be detained for a further period.\nIt is plain, looking at the language of this statute, that the intention of Parliament was, that if the man is found to be a habitual criminal, then, in addition to the sentence of three years' penal servitude for the substantive offence, he may be sentenced to preventive detention.\nThe object of our own legislation is manifested in the provisions of s. 575 (b) which, and so far as the object of Part X(A) is concerned, are couched in terms similar to those of s. 10 s-s. 1 of the English Act. If anything, I think that the provisions of the former are more apt than those of the latter to support, with respect to Part X(A), a conclusion similar to the one reached by the English Criminal Court of Appeal for, at the end of s. 10, s-s. 1, it is said:\u2014\n\u2026and a person on whom such a sentence is passed shall, whilst undergoing both the sentence of penal servitude and the sentence of preventive detention, be deemed for the purposes of the Forfeiture Act, 1870, and for all other purposes, to be a person convicted of felony. The corresponding wording of s. 575 (b) is:\u2014\n\u2026and the person on whom such a sentence is passed shall be deemed for the purpose of this Part to be a habitual criminal.\nNowhere in enacting Part X(A) did Parliament use the word \"offence\" to characterize the conditions which must be met before one may be deemed to be a habitual criminal. Part X(A) does not define a habitual criminal but it does give in s. 575 (b) and s. 575 (c), the circumstances which must co-exist before a person may be deemed for the purpose of this new part, to be a habitual criminal. These circumstances are:\u2014\n1. A fresh, precedent and contemporaneous conviction of an indictable offence after the commencement of the part;\n2. An admission of the convicted offender or a finding by a jury or a Judge that he is a habitual criminal within the meaning of either (a) or (b) of s. 575 (c);\n3. A formed opinion of the Judge, before whom the conviction for the substantive offence took place, that, by reason of the criminal habits and mode of life of the convicted offender, it is expedient for the protection of the public that a further sentence, ordering his detention in a prison for an indeterminate period be passed;\n4. An actual passing of such an additional sentence.\nAs it appears, a mere admission or finding under s. 575 (c), though a condition precedent, is not sufficient for, under s. 575 (b), the judge must also be of opinion that, for reasons therein stated, it is expedient for the protection of the public to pass, in addition to the one given as to the substantive offence, a sentence for an indeterminate period, and must actually pronounce such additional sentence.\nPart X(A) does not authorize a charge for being a habitual criminal to obtain independently. And, moreover, the Part has no effective application unless the substantive charge for the criminal offence is prosecuted and found.\nIn brief, the object of the Part is not to create a new crime but, to use the relevant terms of the title of the English Act, \"To make better provision for the prevention of crime and for that purpose to provide for\u2026 the prolonged detention of habitual criminals\u2026\"\nDealing with (b):\u2014As indicated by the title \"Speedy trials of Indictable Offences\", as well as clearly stated in s. 825 and s. 582, the provisions of Part XVIII\u2014including the right to elect to have an offence tried before a judge alone\u2014have no application except in the case of certain indictable offences. And as speedy trials are a marked departure from the common law, and as the provisions related thereto establish a special statutory jurisdiction which cannot be extended beyond the terms of the statute, not only would it be necessary for the appellant to show successfully that to be a habitual criminal is a criminal offence, but that this criminal offence is indictable. In the general pattern followed by Parliament, when a new offence is created, the nature of the offence is always and must of necessity be given, for it is the ascribed nature of the offence that determines the course of proceedings for its prosecution. This Parliament does\u2014for an indictable offence\u2014in stating either that the offence is indictable or that the offender may be prosecuted by indictment and\u2014in the case of an offence which is not indictable\u2014by describing it purely and simply as an \"offence\" or by stating that the offender is punishable on summary conviction. In this respect, and for the obvious reason that Parliament did not purport to create an offence, Part X(A) is denuded of any indication. It is true that s. 575 (c) s-s. 2 provides:\nIn any indictment under this section it shall be sufficient, after changing the crime, to state that the offender is a habitual criminal.\nBut the indictment to which this sub-section refers is manifestly the one reciting the substantive offence; and while a conviction on such indictment is a condition precedent to the substantial operation of Part X(A), an acquittal on the same brings the whole matter to an end.\nIf, as the appellant must contend to succeed, to be a habitual criminal is effectively an indictable offence, there was no need for Parliament to enact, in positive language, the provisions of the opening section of Part X(A), i.e., s. 575 (a), to empower a judge acting under Part XVIII to apply the provisions of Part X(A), for such jurisdiction was already given to him by s. 825 and s. 582. But, and because Parliament did not mean to create an indictable offence coming within the jurisdiction ratione materiae of a judge acting under Part XVIII, it was necessary to enact s. 575 (a) to enable him to apply the provisions of Part X(A).\nIn my respectful view, this first ground cannot be entertained. The second point of dissent is:\u2014\nAlternatively the charge of being a habitual criminal, if it is not a charge of a criminal offence, so materially affects the punishment that may be imposed that the accused is entitled to notice of the habitual criminal proceedings before being called upon to elect as to the mode of trial on the substantive offence.\nIf, as above concluded, to be a habitual criminal is not an offence and there is no jurisdiction ratione materiae under Part XVIII but simply a power given by s. 575 (a) of the new part to a judge acting under Part XVIII to apply the provisions of Part X(A), then there is no text of law to justify this second contention. To accept it would effectively be tantamount to amend the speedy trial provisions, in making them applicable to the charge of being a habitual criminal, and in conditioning the election of the substantive charge for an indictable offence to the addition of a formality unprovided for in s. 827 to cover a case never contemplated when Part XVIII was first enacted, i.e. at a time when neither Part X(A) nor even the Prevention of Crime Act were law.\nFurthermore, the reason underlying this second proposition is not consonant but inconsistent with the economy of the Criminal Code. It is said that the charge of being a habitual criminal so materially affects the punishment that may be imposed, that the accused is entitled to notice of the habitual criminal proceedings before being called upon to elect as to the mode of trial on the substantive charge; and in support of this proposition, reference is made to Rex v. Armitage[16]. At the time of this decision, there were in Canada, as to the advisability to refer to previous conviction or convictions in a charge for an offence for which a greater punishment may be inflicted by reason of such previous conviction or convictions, two schools of thought amongst the members of the judiciary. One view was that it was unfair to the accused to have, at the very outset of the procedure, no notice of the intention of the Crown to ask for the greater punishment provided in such cases. The other view was that a reference, on the charge, to such previous convictions was unfair because prejudicing the case as to the offence charged. These two views led to conflicting jurisprudence and, in 1943, by 7 George VI c. 23, the Code was amended and Parliament, adopting the latter view, prohibited any reference to such previous conviction or convictions in all proceedings under Parts XV, XVI and XVIII before conviction on the substantive offence. It was then clearly enacted that no information or no charge for an offence for which greater punishment may be inflicted by reason of previous conviction or convicitions, shall contain any reference to such previous conviction or convictions. The Armitage case, consistent with the first view, was decided before such amendment.\nFurthermore, the whole matter, being one of sentence\u2014as was decided in the Hunter case\u2014is one beyond the field of election which is strictly related to the trial of the offence as to which the right of election is given and has nothing to do with the sentence.\nWith deference for those who entertain on the whole matter a contrary opinion, I must, for the above reasons, conclude that this appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Farris, Stultz, Bull & Farris.\nSolicitor for the respondent: L.

By an escape clause, each party was to deposit $500 and \"forfeit the same in case he changes his mind or for other reason cannot complete contemplated deal\". The agreement was also signed by the wives of the parties.\nSoon after the parties had exchanged possession and before the deal was completed, the male appellant gave notice of repudiation and commenced action to have the agreement declared void for misrepresentation or, alternatively, voidable under the escape clause. The respondent counterclaimed for specific performance. A second action was brought by both appellants against both respondents on the ground that the agreement was void for non-compliance with the Dower Act. Both actions were tried together.\nHeld: The appellants were entitled to withdraw from the agreement under the escape clause.\nPer Kerwin and Estey JJ.: The appellants were also entitled to succeed by virtue of the provisions of the Dower Act. The requirements of that Act were not complied with and the male appellant was not estopped from asserting his rights under it.\nPer Kellock and Locke JJ.: No question of dower rights was involved. The male appellant undertook to put himself into a position to convey and his wife must be taken to have undertaken to do whatever was necessary on her part to enable the husband to convey.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division 1, reversing the judgment at trial and holding that the agreement for sale and exchange of property was enforceable.\nN. D. Maclean Q.C. for the appellants.\nG. H. Steer Q.C. and G. A. C. Steer for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Estey JJ. was delivered by:-\nEstey, J.:\u2014Under date of September 22, 1949, Thomas Wass and William Pinsky entered into the following agreement:\nThomas Wass is the owner of E\u00bd 20 and S.E. 28 both in Twp. 48, Rge 13-4 and agrees to sell the same Wm. Pinsky for $5,000 clear of encumbrances and taxes.\nWm. Pinsky is the owner of dwelling and lots in the City of Edmonton described as follows: Lots 10 and 11, in Block 106, King Edward Subdivision Plan 1.1 and agrees to sell the same to Thos. Wass for $7,500 clear of encumbrances and taxes. Thos. Wass will pay Wm. Pinsky the difference between $7,500 and $5,000, namely $2,500, in cash and will in addition lend Wm. Pinsky the sum of $800 (so that Wm. Pinsky will have enough cash to pay off encumbrances or agreement for sale against the above described lots). For this reason an agreement for sale will be given by Thos. Wass to Wm. Pinsky covering above described farm lands under which the balance owing will be set out as being the sum of $800 with interest at 5 per cent and the whole payable Nov. 1, 1950. Transfer to be given when the said balance under said agreement is paid.\nWm. Pinsky to give transfer of above lots at time Thos. Wass gives said agreement for sale.\nEach party to deposit the sum of five hundred ($500) dollars in accepted bank cheque on the signing hereof and to forfeit the same in case he changes his mind or for other reason cannot complete contemplated deal.\nWm. Pinsky\nHis Wife Anna Pinsky\nT. Wass\nHis Wife Ella Wass\nOn October 19 the parties exchanged possession of the aforementioned properties. On October 25 the appellant William Pinsky notified the respondent Thomas Wass that he was withdrawing from the agreement. Wass then took the position which he has maintained throughout that once the respective parties took possession the provisions of the last clause (hereinafter called the escape clause) could not be invoked.\nThe appellant William Pinsky thereafter brought an action alleging fraudulent misrepresentation and asking that the agreement be declared null and void and, in the alternative, that he had a right to withdraw under the escape clause and consequential relief. The respondent counterclaimed for specific performance.\nWhen it was later discovered that the appellant Anna Pinsky had been, at all times material hereto, owner of lots 10 and 11 a second action was brought by both appellants against both respondents in which, inter alia, it was alleged that the appellant Anna Pinsky was at all times the owner of lots 10 and 11 referred to in the agreement and that the Dower Act (1948 S. of A., c. 7) had not been complied with and, therefore, the agreement was null and void. These actions were tried together.\nThe learned trial judge found that there had been no fraudulent misrepresentation. This was affirmed in the Appellate Division 2 and is not an issue in this appeal. The appellants here contend that under the escape clause they were entitled to withdraw from the agreement and further that in any event the agreement is null and void because of non-compliance with the Dower Act.\nAs to the escape clause the learned trial judge stated:\nI have come to the conclusion that the clause must be given literal recognition, that the Pinskys before completion changed their minds as the agreement permitted them to do, and that their demand for the house property should have been acceded to.\nChief Justice O'Connor agreed. The other learned judges of the Appellate Division, upon the construction of this clause, agreed with Mr. Justice W. A. Macdonald who, after stating that the agreement would not be completed until November 1, 1950, continued:\nI am unable to conclude that the agreement as a whole means that each party may go on diligently fulfilling his obligations under its terms, only to find in the end that the whole deal has collapsed by virtue of the withdrawal clause. The agreement must be read as a whole, and this clause must be reconciled insofar as reconciliation is possible with the other provisions of the agreement. It is conceded that on the date of the agreement and thereafter so long as matters remained in statu quo either party was free to withdraw and to put an end to the deal. But I do not think this clause enables either party to continue to affirm the agreement and to take benefits under it and still to retain the right to repudiate it. Once a definite step is taken by the parties in part performance of its terms and the continued existence of the agreement is recognized in this manner, then and thereafter the withdrawal clause ceases to have any effect. Such a step took place when the parties exchanged possession and in so doing each elected to be bound by the agreement. The validity of the withdrawal clause and of the agreement as a whole will be dealt with later.\nThis agreement must be read and construed in relation to the position in which the parties found themselves at the time of its execution and in this regard the evidence is not contradictory. An important circumstance was that Thomas Wass would not be in a position to pay the $2,500 and the loan of $800 until he had sold his grain and cattle. The date of this sale being uncertain, by common consent of the parties a date for the completion of this agreement was not inserted.\nThe agreement contemplates that it would be completed by the loan of $800, the removal of the encumbrances from lots 10 and 11, the payment of $2,500, the transfer of lots 10 and 11 and an agreement for sale in respect of the farm for the sum of $800 to be paid November 1, 1950. When all this was done the contract was completed.\nI am in agreement with the learned judges who state that this escape clause must be read and construed with the agreement as a whole, but, with great respect, I cannot agree that November 1, 1950, is the date fixed for completion of the contract. On the contrary, the terms of this contract, in the fall of 1949, after Wass had raised the necessary money and the items therein specified had been completed, would be carried out. These items would include an agreement relative to the $800 to be paid on November 1, 1950. This latter agreement, however, while arising out of the contract here in question, would itself constitute another and different contract. The parties had provided that withdrawal might take place under the escape clause at any time up to the date for the completion of the aforesaid items. It would, therefore, appear that the appellants exercised their right to withdraw well within the prescribed time.\nIt is contended that the exchanges of possession on October 19 and the transfer of the gas, water, light and telephone accounts in Edmonton from appellants to respondents constituted an election, or created an estoppel which prevented either party having recourse to the escape clause. Counsel for the respondents contends that the election is here similar to that of an infant upon becoming of age or a defrauded party upon attaining knowledge of the fraud. The essential difference is, however, that the law places a duty upon such an infant and the party defrauded to make an election upon the happening of the events mentioned, while in this case the contract gave to each party a right to withdraw prior to the completion of the agreement. In the exchanges of possession they were acting in accord with their intention to carry out the contract, indeed the same intention with which they entered into the agreement on September 22 and transferred the post office box at Viking from respondents to appellants. This is not a case where an obligation rested upon either party to do anything in furtherance of their intention to carry out the contract, but whatever they might do they knew was subject to the terms of their contract, including the right to withdraw. There is no misrepresentation here present upon which an estoppel might be founded. Each party went into possession on October 19 before Wass had completed his sale and, therefore, before the contract was completed. They did so apparently for their own convenience and with full knowledge of their contractual rights to withdraw. It is in principle similar to that of Toronto Electric Light Company v. Toronto Corporation 3, where the issues raised concerned the right of the city to remove poles of the Electric Light Company, including those erected by it with the implied consent of the city. The contention that the city, having impliedly consented to the erection of certain poles, could not remove them was dismissed, with the statement at p. 99:\nNo estoppel arises in this case, as there is no evidence whatever that both the contracting parties were not fully aware of their respective legal rights.\nI am equally of the opinion that the appellants succeed by virtue of the provisions of the Dower Act 1948 (1948 S. of A., c. 7). The Legislature of Alberta in 1917 enacted the first Dower Act. It is unnecessary to review the history of that Act and subsequent legislation, as in 1948 the then dower legislation (1942 R.S.A., c. 206) was repealed and the Legislature, in enacting a new Dower Act (1948 S. of A., c. 7), adopted a somewhat different and more comprehensive approach. While the prevention of the disposition of \u00e0 homestead by a married person without the consent of that married person's spouse remains the intent and purpose of this dower legislation, the statute of 1948 contains many new features. Dower rights are now given to the husband as well as the wife and for the first time these are specifically defined.\nThe material part of the definition of dower rights reads as follows:\n2. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,\u2014\n(b) \"Dower rights\" means all rights given by this Act to the spouse of a married person in respect of the homestead and property of such married person, and without restricting the generality of the foregoing includes,\u2014\n(i) the right to prevent disposition of the homestead by withholding consent; This definition of dower rights, by including the words \"without restricting the generality of the foregoing,\" discloses an intention not to restrict the spouse to the remedies therein specified. It was never the intention of the Legislature that, though withholding consent in writing and filing a caveat under s. 9, the spouse must then await developments. The creation of a present interest, while the position of the parties remains as in this case, supports an action, such as here brought, for a declaration that the agreement is unenforceable and for an order that possession be restored.\nSection 3 expressly prohibits the married person making a disposition of the homestead without the consent in writing of the spouse.\n3. (1) No married person shall make any disposition by act inter vivos of the homestead of the married person whereby any interest of the married person shall or may vest in any other person at any time during the life of the married person or during the life of the spouse of such married person living at the date of the disposition, unless the spouse consents thereto in writing or unless a judge has made an order dispensing with the consent of the spouse as hereinafter provided for.\n(2) Every married person who makes any such disposition of a homestead without the consent in writing of the spouse of such married person or without an order dispensing with the consent of the spouse shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years.\nThe opening words of this s. 3 specifically prohibit \"any disposition by act inter vivos of the homestead of the married person \u2026 unless the spouse consents thereto in writing \u2026\" Then in s.-s. (2) provision is made for the imposition of a penalty when any married person violates the provisions of s.-s. (1). This direct prohibition, together with the provision for a penalty, makes the agreement legally unenforceable at the instance of the married person. Indeed, under the general rule, the contract would be void. That, however, is a matter of construction, as stated by Viscount Haldane in Cornelius v. Phillips 4 :\nThese words do not appear to be ambiguous \u2026 So standing they are clear, and they prohibit, and therefore make void, any contract which contravenes them \u2026 There might have been inserted in the statute a special context which would have modified the application of the general rule, but there is nothing in the actual context to exclude the ordinary result which follows in law when a statutory prohibition is disregarded. There is here present, in the actual context, a clear intention that the agreement shall not be void but contemplates that the agreement may be carried out and a transfer pursuant thereto registered in the Land Titles Office ; that upon such registration the land shall be no longer a homestead (s. 4(2) (1)) and thereafter the married person shall be liable to the spouse in damages (s. 12(1)) which, when not recovered, may be satisfied from the assurance fund (s. 2(b) (iii)). These sections indicate that the Legislature intended the agreement should be voidable rather than void and emphasize that the position of the spouse prior to registration is quite different from that after registration.\nIn the more usual case the spouse would not be a party to the disposition. In this case William Pinsky, under the belief that he was the owner of lots 10 and 11, was a party to the agreement. Throughout he acted only after consultation with his wife and, once it was ascertained that she was the owner, it has been, quite properly I think, accepted throughout this litigation that whatever he did was as her agent. In the result, however, I do not think that alters the position in law. The statute requires (s. 6) that the spouse, in this case William Pinsky, must evidence his consent in writing and acknowledge, apart from his wife, that he was aware of the nature of the disposition ; that he had a life estate in the homestead and the right to prevent its disposition; that he consented for the purpose of giving up his life estate and other dower rights and that he did so freely and voluntarily, without any compulsion on the part of the married person. This requirement of the statute was not complied with, nor does the evidence establish any basis for holding that he is estopped from asserting his dower rights. There is no evidence that he was aware of his dower rights ; in fact, throughout they were never mentioned. In these circumstances William Pinsky, as spouse, is not estopped from the insistence upon his dower rights.\nMrs. Pinsky deposes that the premises described herein as lots 10 and 11 were her home and that the basement and rooms in the upstairs had been rented \"off and on.\" This evidence is not sufficient to justify a conclusion that these premises are not her homestead. The evidence discloses that William Pinsky owned a farm, but he states positively that he had lived at these Edmonton premises four or five years. Under these circumstances the contention that this is not the homestead of Anna Pinsky and that William Pinsky is not entitled to dower rights therein cannot be maintained.\nThe agreement in writing specifically provided that both agreed to sell their respective properties. While Pinsky agreed to transfer his property, Wass undertook to transfer his property and pay an amount of money. With great respect to the learned judge who expressed a contrary view, this writing would appear to constitute an \"agreement for sale\" and, therefore, a disposition within the meaning of s. 2(a).\nThe appeals should be allowed with costs here and in the Appellate Division. No question was raised as to the learned trial judge's direction that the respondents might retain the $500 and his judgment should be restored, with para. 5 thereof varied to read as follows:\nAND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the claim of the plaintiffs based upon misrepresentation be dismissed.\nTaschereau J.\u2014I do not think that for the determination of these appeals, it is necessary to consider the question raised as to the application of the Dower Act.\nFor the reasons given by my brothers Kellock and Estey on the effect of the \"Escape Clause\", I would allow the appeals, and restore the judgment of the trial judge with costs here and in the court below.\nThe judgment of Kellock and Locke, JJ. was delivered by:-\nKellock, J.:\u2014Two points arise in this appeal. In the first place, it is said on behalf of the appellants that as the Edmonton premises were in fact the property of the appellant, Anna Pinsky, the appellant William Pinsky was entitled to dower rights, and that as the agreement of September 22, 1949, did not comply with the provisions of the relevant statute, 1948, c. 7, the respondents must fail.\nIn my opinion this statute does not afford any assistance to the appellants. Under the agreement in question, William Pinsky contracted as \"owner\". As at that time the title was in his wife, he was in fact contracting to put himself into a position to convey. The appellant Anna Pinsky, by her execution of the document, must be taken to have been undertaking with the respondents to do whatever would be necessary to enable her husband, at the proper time, effectively to convey. Accordingly, in my opinion, no question of dower rights on the part of the male appellant is involved. This is the only point taken with respect to the statute.\nThe remaining question arises under the so-called \"escape clause\", which reads as follows:\nEach party to deposit the sum of five hundred ($500) dollars in accepted bank cheque on the signing hereof and to forfeit the same in case he changes his mind or for other reason cannot complete contemplated deal.\nUnder the earlier terms of the agreement, the respondent Thomas Wass agreed (1) to pay to appellant William Pinsky $3,300 (of which $800 was to be a loan), and (2) to enter into an agreement of sale of the Wass farm to the male appellant for $800, payable November 1, 1950, with interest at 8 per cent. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this agreement of sale, Pinsky was to execute and deliver to Wass a transfer of the Edmonton property. Pinsky, however, was not to receive a transfer of the farm until the monies called for by the agreement of sale should be paid.\nNo time was fixed by the written agreement for the payment of the $3,300 and the execution and delivery of the documents, but it is common ground that this was to occur only after the respondent Wass had been able to sell his farm, stock and implements. Thus, the \"contemplated deal\" would be completed. The evidence of the male respondent is perfectly clear on this point. He deposed also that he was depending upon the sale for the money to enable him to complete. It is, therefore, to the period between the execution of the agreement of September 22, 1949, and the date of completion to which the escape clause relates. At any time within this period either party might, according to the express term of the contract, withdraw.\nBefore the sale of the farm stock and implements occurred, the respondent Ella Wass and her son, on October 19, moved into the Edmonton house, and the Pinskys, with their son-in-law, moved out to the farm, but the respondent Thomas Wass continued to live there also. The day following the execution of the agreement of September 22, the Pinskys, who had spent the night on the Wass farm, changed over the rural mail box from the respondents to the appellants and when the respondent Ella Wass and her son moved into the city house, the city gas and water services were changed over to Wass.\nIt appears that the Pinskys had intended that the farm should be operated by their son-in-law, a veteran, who, following upon the execution of the agreement of September 22, applied to a department of the provincial government for a loan upon the farm under certain legislation pertaining to veterans. The loan, however, was refused by the government official in charge on the ground of the poorness in quality of the land. On learning this, the Pinskys, on October 25, the day preceding the sale, advised the male respondent that they declined to go on with the transaction and their reason for so doing. On the 27th of October, the day after the sale of the stock and implements, they and their son-in-law left the farm.\nIt is argued on behalf of the respondents that it was then too late for the Pinskys to attempt to avail themselves of the escape clause. Before considering this contention, it may be observed that had there been no change of possession at all, but had Wass nonetheless sold his stock and implements, the appellants might still, under the term of the agreement, have declined to complete. In such ease, the only recourse of Wass would have been to retain the appellants' deposit of $500. Such a situation would have been much more prejudicial to Wass than was the actual situation when the appellants advised him of their change of intention. At that time he had not carried out his proposed sale and, had he seen fit, could have cancelled it.\nHad the sale, when it did occur, failed to produce the necessary monies to enable Wass to carry out the transaction, it is difficult to see how the express right given him by the contract to decline to go on \"in case he . . . for other reason cannot complete\" would no longer have availed merely because, in the expectation that no such difficulty would arise, he had allowed the Pinskys on to the farm and had placed his wife and son in the city house. If that be so in the case of the respondents, there would seem to be no more reason why the same result should not follow in the case of the appellants when a situation arose which they had not expected. All this, it seems to me, is covered by the express term of the agreement between the parties. In my opinion the clause must be given its literal effect, and should be construed as a provision designed to meet all eventualities, the only consequence of failure to complete being the loss of $500.\nThe problem which arises in the case at bar is not without analogy to that arising under the implied condition that a vendor in the absence of something to the contrary must make out a good title. In the present case the time within which to comply with that condition would be at any time prior to the date of closing.\nAs stated in the 8th edition of Dart, p. 443 : \"Possession, if taken \u2026 with the consent of the vendor is not in itself, as a general rule, any waiver of the purchaser's right to a good title. Spragge, V.C., in Mitcheltree v. Irwin 5, puts the matter thus at 542:\nThe mere taking of possession by a purchaser is not necessarily a waiver of the right to an inquiry as to title. The Court will not hold it to be so unless satisfied that it was the intention of the purchaser to take the land without such inquiry; \u2026\nIn my opinion, it is at least equally the case that under a clause such as that here in question the mere taking of possession is not sufficient to establish that the respondent Wass intended to preclude himself from the right to refuse to complete if it should turn out that he did not receive sufficient monies from the sale of his stock and implements to enable him to do so. If that be so, the appellants equally are not precluded from relying upon a \"change of mind\" which the agreement expressly provides could occur at any time up to the actual exchange of documents.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the appellants should have judgment for the relief granted by the learned trial judge with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Maclean & Dunne.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Milner, Steer, Dyde, Poirier, Martland & Layton.\n1 [1951] 3 D.L.R. 455; 2 W.W.R.

The crime was committed in June 1947. The deceased was returning home from the City of Quebec in a taxicab driven by the appellant. He was in the back seat with two other passengers, one Valli\u00e8res and one L\u00e9gar\u00e9. Another passenger was in the front seat. There was some beer drinking during the ride and at one time the deceased, who had become noisy and quarrelsome, threatened to strike L\u00e9gar\u00e9 with a bottle. The car was stopped; the appellant and the three rear passengers got out; the deceased was then hit with a bottle by both Valli\u00e8res and L\u00e9gar\u00e9 and when he was on the ground and unconscious, the appellant struck him with his fists and feet. He was then put on the floor of the car where he remained without making a sound, except for one prolonged sigh, until the appellant, with or without the help of Valli\u00e8res and L\u00e9gar\u00e9, is alleged to have thrown him in a river. The theory of the Crown was that the deceased died as a result of the blows struck during the fighting and not by drowning. The appellant's conviction was affirmed by a majority in the Court of Appeal for Quebec.\nHeld: The trial judge, by omitting to review that part of the evidence which showed that the deceased could have died before he was thrown in the river, left the jury with the impression that the deceased died by drowning rather than as the result of the blows. The theory of the defence was, therefore, not adequately put to the jury, and the conviction should be quashed.\nHeld further: Under the exceptional circumstances of this case, and specially in view of the theory on which the case for the Crown was based, a verdict of manslaughter should be substituted for the jury's verdict.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming, Pratte and Hyde JJ.A. dissenting, the appellant's conviction upon a charge of murder. Valli\u00e8res and L\u00e9gar\u00e9, who were alleged to have participated with the appellant in the commission of the crime, pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter after a verdict of murder, pronounced against L\u00e9gar\u00e9, had been quashed by the Court of Appeal for Quebec. A. Chevalier Q.C. for the appellant.\nN. Dorion Q.C. and P.

Le crime aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 commis au cours d'un voyage entre Qu\u00e9bec et St. G\u00e9rard de Magella, conjointement avec Maurice L\u00e9gar\u00e9 et Auguste Valli\u00e8res. Des plaidoyers de \"coupables de manslaughter\" de la part de L\u00e9gar\u00e9 et Valli\u00e8res ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9s par la Couronne apr\u00e8s qu'un verdict de meurtre, prononc\u00e9 contre L\u00e9gar\u00e9, e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 cass\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc de la Reine. Tous deux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 respectivement condamn\u00e9s \u00e0 huit ann\u00e9es de p\u00e9nitencier. Quant \u00e0 l'appelant, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement une premi\u00e8re fois trouv\u00e9 coupable de meurtre, il a aussi obtenu un nouveau proc\u00e8s par jugement de cette Cour 2, puis condamn\u00e9 une seconde fois. Il appelle maintenant du jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine 3 qui a refus\u00e9 son pourvoi, MM. les Juges Pratte et Hyde dissidents.\nLe soir du 14 juin 1947, l'appelant, domicili\u00e9 \u00e0 Val St. Michel, et qui est conducteur de taxi, est descendu \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec en compagnie de Maurice L\u00e9gar\u00e9, Auguste Valli\u00e8res et Armand Demers, trois b\u00fbcherons employ\u00e9s \u00e0 la Rivi\u00e8re aux Pins, pr\u00e8s du Lac St-Joseph. Apr\u00e8s qu'ils eussent bu chacun quelques bouteilles de bi\u00e8re dans une taverne locale, les compagnons se sont s\u00e9par\u00e9s, pour se retrouver vers 11 heures P.M. \u00e0 un endroit convenu sur la rue St-Roch. A ce lieu de rendez-vous, il y avait cependant une cinqui\u00e8me personne, G\u00e9rard Beaumont, qui devait \u00eatre la victime de cette malheureuse trag\u00e9die. La preuve ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas clairement si Beaumont est mont\u00e9 volontairement dans la voiture de Lizotte, ou s'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 contraint par force de le faire. Mais \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, les cinq voyageurs sont repartis vers 11 heures P.M. se dirigeant vers le chemin de Valcartier, pour apparemment gagner leurs domiciles respectifs.\nEn route, il y eut de nouvelles consommations de bi\u00e8re, et Beaumont, sans doute excit\u00e9 par les liqueurs alcooliques, \u00e9tait tapageur et chantait. Au lieu de se calmer \u00e0 la demande des autres passagers, il mena\u00e7a de frapper L\u00e9gar\u00e9 d'une bouteille, et ce n'est que gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'intervention de Valli\u00e8res qu'il ne donna pas suite \u00e0 son projet. Il semble que d'un commun accord, Lizotte, L\u00e9gar\u00e9 et Valli\u00e8res ont voulu faire un mauvais parti \u00e0 Beaumont, car Lizotte a arr\u00eat\u00e9 sa voiture, il en est descendu, de m\u00eame que L\u00e9gar\u00e9 et Valli\u00e8res. On en fit sortir Beaumont, et l\u00e0 sur le bord du chemin conduisant \u00e0 St-G\u00e9rard, Valli\u00e8res et L\u00e9gar\u00e9 ont tous deux frapp\u00e9 Beaumont d'un coup de bouteille sur la t\u00eate. Alors qu'il gisait \u00e0 terre, sans connaissance, Lizotte lui appliqua des coups de poing dans le visage ainsi que des coups de pied sur le corps et dans la r\u00e9gion de la gorge. On le pla\u00e7a ensuite sur le plancher dans la partie arri\u00e8re de la voiture, o\u00f9 il demeura immobile, et sans murmurer une seule parole. Lizotte se rendit \u00e0 St-G\u00e9rard prendre de l'essence. En arrivant sur une route bois\u00e9e de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9, Lizotte arr\u00eata la voiture, et avec l'aide de L\u00e9gar\u00e9 et Valli\u00e8res, descendit Beaumont, lui enleva une partie de ses v\u00eatements, et on lui enleva la somme de $38 qu'il portait sur lui. Les v\u00eatements furent jet\u00e9s dans le foss\u00e9, et retrouv\u00e9s plus tard. Quelque temps avant d'arriver \u00e0 St-G\u00e9rard, Beaumont, qui dans le fond de la voiture \u00e9tait toujours demeur\u00e9 immobile, rendit un soupir prolong\u00e9.\nOn revint ensuite dans la direction de Qu\u00e9bec, et \u00e0 un endroit du c\u00f4t\u00e9 Nord de la Rivi\u00e8re St-Charles, non loin de la ville, \"Le Remous des Hirondelles\", Lizotte arr\u00eata de nouveau, et seul, ou avec l'aide de L\u00e9gar\u00e9 et Valli\u00e8res, (la preuve est contradictoire sur ce point) et sous pr\u00e9texte de \"laver\" Beaumont, le transporta vers le bord escarp\u00e9 de la rivi\u00e8re, et en revint sans la victime environ dix minutes plus tard. Il recommanda aux autres \"de ne pas parler\", et que \"l'affaire finirait l\u00e0\". Huit jours plus tard, on retrouva le corps de Beaumont dans les eaux de la Rivi\u00e8re, pr\u00e8s de la ville de Qu\u00e9bec. Ce n'est qu'un an plus tard, quand les v\u00eatements de Beaumont furent retrouv\u00e9s dans le bois, que l'on commen\u00e7a l'enqu\u00eate sur cette mort myst\u00e9rieuse, qu'\u00e0 l'origine on avait crue accidentelle.\nJ'ai cru n\u00e9cessaire de faire ce r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des faits, afin de bien faire saisir la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle je suis arriv\u00e9.\nLes principaux griefs d'appel de Lizotte sont les suivants :\n1) Dans son adresse aux jur\u00e9s, le juge pr\u00e9sidant au proc\u00e8s aurait omis de leur signaler, comme il aurait d\u00fb le faire, certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve tendant \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer le moment o\u00f9 Beaumont est mort. 2) Ce n'est pas le paragraphe D de l'article 259 (Code Cr.) qui s'applique, mais bien le paragraphe B, sur lequel les jur\u00e9s n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement instruits.\n3) A d\u00e9faut d'acquittement, seul un verdict de \"manslaughter\" pouvait \u00eatre rendu par un jury correctement inform\u00e9.\nLe premier grief, s'il est fond\u00e9, est celui qui \u00e0 notre sens doit d\u00e9terminer le sort de cet appel. En effet, si Beaumont est mort parce qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 jet\u00e9 dans la rivi\u00e8re par Lizotte, ce dernier serait indiscutablement coupable de meurtre. Au cours de sa charge aux jur\u00e9s, le juge pr\u00e9sidant au proc\u00e8s, apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9cit\u00e9 certains faits saillants de cette triste aventure, semble avoir omis quelques \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, essentiels pour arriver \u00e0 une juste conclusion. Sans doute, il n'est pas imp\u00e9ratif que le juge d\u00e9crive en d\u00e9tail toutes et chacune des circonstances qui ont entour\u00e9 un crime, mais encore faut-il qu'il place devant le jury tout ce qui est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 par les t\u00e9moignages, soit de la Couronne ou de la d\u00e9fense, qui peut \u00eatre un moyen s\u00e9rieux de disculper l'accus\u00e9. (Le Roi v. Azoulay 4) ; (Le Roi v. Kelsey 5) ; (Vide Lord Goddard in Dereck Clayton-Wright 6).\nAvec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, nous ne croyons pas que ces exigences de la loi aient \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9es, et que la th\u00e9orie de la d\u00e9fense ait \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise aux jur\u00e9s, comme elle aurait d\u00fb l'\u00eatre. Il semble incontestable que la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve d\u00e9montre que Beaumont est mort bien avant qu'il ne soit jet\u00e9 dans la Rivi\u00e8re St-Charles. L\u00e9gar\u00e9, Valli\u00e8res, Demers, t\u00e9moignent tous que Beaumont, apr\u00e8s les coups qui lui furent port\u00e9s, gisait immobile dans le fond de la voiture et qu'il ne pronon\u00e7ait aucune parole. On n'entendait pas sa respiration, sauf le long soupir qu'il rendit en arrivant \u00e0 St-G\u00e9rard, et qui fut probablemet son dernier. Aucune apparence de vie ne s'est manifest\u00e9e, lorsque le corps inerte a \u00e9t\u00e9 replac\u00e9 dans la voiture apr\u00e8s l'assaut dont il fut la victime, pas plus que quand on l'a sorti de nouveau pour le d\u00e9valiser, ou pour plus tard le jeter dans la rivi\u00e8re. C'est bien Lizotte qui, r\u00e9alisant ce qui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 Beaumont, dit \u00e0 Demers, avant de se diriger vers la Rivi\u00e8re St-Charles, \"Tu vas nous aider Ti-blond, ou bien tu vas mourir toi aussi.\" La preuve m\u00e9dicale semble \u00eatre au m\u00eame effet. Le Docteur Fontaine qui a examin\u00e9 la victime, n'a pas constat\u00e9 de fracture du cr\u00e2ne comme r\u00e9sultat des coups de bouteille, mais para\u00eet \u00eatre d'opinion qu'il est possible que la mort soit la cons\u00e9quence d'une h\u00e9morragie interne, qui aurait provoqu\u00e9 un \u00e9touffement. D'ailleurs, la Couronne n'a pas pr\u00e9tendu que Beaumont \u00e9tait mort noy\u00e9. Au contraire, elle a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il \u00e9tait mort des coups qu'il avait re\u00e7us, et que ce n'est qu'un cadavre qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 jet\u00e9 \u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re.\nCe point de vue n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis aux jur\u00e9s. A sa lecture, l'ensemble de la charge ignore enti\u00e8rement le t\u00e9moignage du Docteur Fontaine, et ne met pas en relief le fait de la mort probable avant que Beaumont ne soit jet\u00e9 dans la rivi\u00e8re. L'impression laiss\u00e9e aux jur\u00e9s a sans doute \u00e9t\u00e9 que la victime est morte noy\u00e9e par l'acte volontaire et pr\u00e9m\u00e9dit\u00e9 de Lizotte, et non comme r\u00e9sultat de la querelle qui a origin\u00e9 dans le taxi sur la route de St-G\u00e9rard. Nous croyons que cette insuffisance d'instruction aux jur\u00e9s, a contribu\u00e9 dans une large mesure \u00e0 la s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 du verdict qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9.\nIl ne nous para\u00eet pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer si, comme les parties l'ont contradictoirement pr\u00e9tendu, c'est le paragraphe (B) sur lequel les jur\u00e9s n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 instruits, ou le paragraphe (D) de l'article 259 (C. Cr.), qui doit trouver son application. Que ce soit l'une ou l'autre de ces dispositions qui r\u00e9gisse le pr\u00e9sent cas, nous croyons que le verdict ne peut \u00eatre maintenu et doit \u00eatre cass\u00e9.\nNous sommes d'avis, en tenant compte des faits particuliers de ce proc\u00e8s, et sp\u00e9cialement de la th\u00e9orie sur laquelle la Couronne a bas\u00e9 sa cause, que les fins de la justice seront bien servies, si cette Cour, en vertu de l'autorit\u00e9 qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par l'article 1024(1) du Code Criminel, rend une ordonnance substituant un verdict de \"manslaughter\" \u00e0 celui de meurtre qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9. (Vide: Manchuk v. Le Roi 7) ; (Lizotte et Savard v. Le Roi 8).\nL'appelant, L\u00e9gar\u00e9 et Valli\u00e8res ont \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9s au mois d'ao\u00fbt 1948, et d\u00e9tenus en prison. L\u00e9gar\u00e9 et Valli\u00e8res ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tous deux condamn\u00e9s pour \"manslaughter\" \u00e0 8 ans de p\u00e9nitencier au mois de mars 1952. Il s'ensuit que l'appelant est incarc\u00e9r\u00e9 depuis pr\u00e8s de 5 ans, et nous croyons en cons\u00e9quence, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les diverses circonstances de cette cause, et vu le sort qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux autres qui ont particip\u00e9 \u00e0 ce crime, qu'une sentence de 8 ann\u00e9es de p\u00e9nitencier, \u00e0 compter du pr\u00e9sent jugement, serait juste et ad\u00e9quate.\nNous sommes d'opinion de maintenir l'appel, de casser le verdict de meurtre qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu, d'y substituer celui de \"manslaughter\", et de condamner l'appelant \u00e0 huit ann\u00e9es de p\u00e9nitencier, \u00e0 compter de la date du pr\u00e9sent jugement.\nAppeal allowed; judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside; direction that the verdict of murder be quashed and a verdict of manslaughter entered; appellant sentenced to imprisonment for eight years from the date of the present judgment.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Alexandre Chevalier.\nSolicitor for the respondent: No\u00ebl Dorion.\n1 Q.R.

(Alcan) entered into an agreement in 1937 with Det Norske Aktieselskab for Elektrokemisk Industri, a Norwegian corporation, for the use until 1953, under a non-exclusive licence subject to royalty payments, of the latter's Canadian patents covering the Soderberg system for manufacturing aluminum. After the outbreak of war in 1939, due to the great increase in production, negotiations were carried on for a reduction in the royalty payments and in 1941 it was agreed that the licence should be changed from a non-exclusive to an exclusive one and that the royalty rate be reduced by one third where annual production exceeded 40,000 metric tons up to an excess of 30,000 tons and be further reduced by one half if production exceeded that amount. Near the end of 1942 further negotiations were begun seeking a ceiling on the amount of royalties but no agreement had been reached when in March 1943 the Deputy Minister of Munitions & Supply (acting under the powers contained in Orders in Council P.C. 6982 of 1940 and 11081 of 1942) notified Alcan no further royalty payments were to be made on orders placed with it by or on behalf of the Crown but that (as provided by the said Orders) the Crown would indemnify Alcan as to any claim made against it for nonpayment of royalties under the terms of any licensing agreement. On the occupation of Norway by the enemy the respondent, The Secretary of State of Canada, as Custodian under the Revised Regulations respecting Trading with the Enemy, became vested with the patents in question and, as provided by s. 19 of the Patent Act, 1935 and the above cited Orders and P.C. 449 of 1944, petitioned the Commissioner of Patents to name a reasonable compensation for the use of the patents by the Crown. The Commissioner found that such compensation was one-fortieth of a cent for each pound of aluminum produced under the process with a limit of $100,000 for any one year. On appeal to the Exchequer Court the President, after hearing evidence of a witness who had not been available at the time of the hearing before the Commissioner, set aside that award and fixed compensation at the rate agreed upon between the parties in 1941, subject to a ceiling of $215,000 in any twelve-month period.\nHeld: that further evidence was properly admitted under the power vested in the Court by r. 40 of the Exchequer Court rules.\nHeld: also, that the evidence disclosed that there had been no agreement between the parties that the maximum total annual payment should be $215,000 and that while this amount had been finally proposed by Elektrokemisk the amount suggested was in payment of rights which included the right to use any improvements made or acquired by the patentee during the terms of the agreement without further payment and the right to the extension of the term of the licence during the life of any such patents. The value of this right was not relevant to the inquiry which concerned only the use of the five patents.\nHeld: further, that the principle applicable in settling compensation under the Orders in Council is the same as in proceedings under s. 19 of the Patent Act, 1935, and a fair and reasonable compensation for such user should be such an amount as would be agreed upon between a willing licensor and a willing licensee bargaining on equal terms, but the fact that the country was at war and that accordingly practically the sole customer was the Crown was a matter to be considered in estimating what amount would be so agreed upon. Such an amount here would be one-twentieth of a cent per pound of aluminum produced by the Soderberg system, subject to a ceiling of $175,000 in any one year. The King v. Irving Air Chute Inc.

The judgment of the Chief Justice, Kerwin, Taschereau, Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nLocke J. :\u2014It is common ground that the claim advanced by the Secretary of State on behalf of Det Norske Aktieselskab for Elektrokemisk Industri (herein referred to as Elektrokemisk) is in respect of the use of five only of the Canadian patents mentioned in the licensing agreement entered into between Elektrokemisk and the Aluminum Company of Canada (to be called Alcan hereinafter). These are No. 264997 dated October 12, 1926, and granted to Elektrokemisk as the assignee of Carl Wilhelm Soderberg; No. 287700 dated March 5, 1929, and granted to it as the assignee of Jens Westley; No. 341667 dated May 15, 1934, granted to it as assignee of Pierre Torchet; No. 346868 dated February 18, 1934, relating to a further invention of Torchet, which patent by assignment is vested in Elektrokemisk and No. 383238 dated August 8, 1939, and granted to it as the assignee of Jean-Louis Legeron. The nature of the inventions described in these letters patent and the manner of their use in the manufacture of aluminum have been described in the judgment appealed from and it is unnecessary to restate them.\nLong prior to the date when the first of these patents was obtained in Canada, Soderberg, a Norwegian, together with Dr. Mathias 0. Sem, had carried on experiments with a view to developing a satisfactory self-baking electrode for use in electric furnaces. Dr. Sem, who gave evidence on the hearing of the appeal before the learned President of the Exchequer Court but who was not available at the time of the hearing before the Commissioner of Patents, was in the year 1914 in the employ of Elektrokemisk as assistant to Soderberg, the Chief Metallurgist of the Company. It was in that year, owing to war conditions, very difficult to obtain pre-baked carbon electrodes and, in an endeavour to develop a self-baking electrode, Soderberg, apparently with the assistance of Sem, developed a method which later became the subject of Canadian Patent No. 215697, the application for which was filed on February 14, 1918, and which was granted on February 7, 1922 to Elektrokemisk as assignee of Soderberg. The method described in the specification was to make a self-baking carbon electrode by inserting in the electrode paste, which consisted of crushed coke and calcined anthracite together with a binder, an iron rod through which the electric current was carried into the mass. These efforts, according to Sem, were not directed to the recovery of aluminum but for the purpose of using the electrodes in a smelting furnace, as used for the production of calcium carbide, ferro-alloys and the like, and the invention was not tried for the production of aluminum anywhere. The method was a failure and apparently would not work for any purpose.\nThe efforts to develop a satisfactory self-baking electrode were, however, continued and on September 23, 1919, an application was made for a Canadian patent for an improved method by enclosing the paste within an iron mantel having ribs or fins of iron which projected into the paste and conveyed the electric current to the electrode, and for which Patent No. 216092 issued on February 21, 1922. Electrodes so made proved successful in smelting furnaces but when tried for the production of aluminum were, according to Dr. Sem, found to be of no value since the use of the iron casing introduced too much impurity into the aluminum. In addition to the inventions described in these two patents, Elektrokemisk had on May 31, 1921, obtained Canadian Patent No. 212181 for a clamping device which pressed on the iron casing of the electrode and enabled the electrode to be lowered as it was consumed but which had no function in the baking of the paste.\nOn July 22, 1924, Elektrokemisk applied as assignee of Soderberg for a further Canadian patent, for a new method of preparing the electrode mass or paste in which the proportion of the binder content was sufficiently high to render the mass liquid and Patent No. 264997 issued in respect of the invention claimed on October 12, 1926.\nThere was evidence, notably that of Dr. Sem, establishing that these inventions controlled by Elektrokemisk were not effective in the production of aluminum and that this was demonstrated by tests made in the plant of the Aluminum Company of America at Baden in North Carolina in 1924. According to Sem, the equipment and the methods used embodied all the knowledge that Elektrokemisk had of the production of aluminum up to that time, but too much power was consumed, there were impurities in the aluminum produced and the product could not successfully compete with that produced by the employment of pre-baked electrodes and the trial was abandoned.\nStress has been laid in the argument of the appellant upon the fact that it was possible to produce aluminum by the use of methods protected by Patents Nos. 215697, 216092 and 264997 and the Commissioner of Patents, in determining what was reasonable compensation for the use of the five patents in question, materially reduced the amount awarded by reason of this fact. I am, however, of the opinion that, in the circumstances of the present case, undue weight was attached to this fact.\nIt was not until the discoveries made by Westley in respect of which Patent No. 287700 was granted and those of Torchet for which Patents Nos. 341667 and 346868 were granted that what may be described as the Soderberg system, for the manufacture and use of self-baked electrodes, became successful in the production of aluminum. Throughout the period during which these various discoveries were made, Elektrokemisk was endeavouring to obtain the acceptance of the methods described in the patents it controlled from time to time by the Aluminum Company of America (referred to in the proceedings as Alcoa), then the largest of all the producers of aluminum on this continent. After the failure of the experiments at Baden in 1924, according to Sem, a further installation was made by Alcoa, after Westley's discovery, and which made use of the invention disclosed in Patent No. 287700, in one of its plants in Tennessee, and in the following four years the method was extensively used but in 1932 Alcoa advised Elektrokemisk that its method could not compete with what were described as European type furnaces which employed pre-baked electrodes. Manufacture was, however, continued for a time on Elektrokemisk agreeing to waive any claim for royalties.\nThe situation changed, however, completely after Torchet's discoveries which were made in France in the summer of 1932, and for which patents were obtained in that country. According to Dr. Sem, the effect of the employment of the methods described in Canadian Patents Nos. 341667 and 346868 was enormous. The patent rights were acquired by Elektrokemisk and according to Sem, the accuracy of whose statement was accepted by the learned President, the successful introduction of the Soderberg system into the aluminum industry started from that time. Thereafter that system, including the methods described in Patents Nos. 264997, 287700 and in the two Torchet's patents, were installed by Alcoa, together with the invention of Legeron referred to in Patent No. 383238, in some, though not all, of their plants. The evidence supports the finding in the judgment appealed from that the employment of these five inventions resulted in the adoption of the Soderberg method throughout by far the greater part of the aluminum industry and that this condition continued up to the time of the hearing.\nIn determining what is reasonable compensation, it is necessary to examine the terms of the two licensing agreements made between Elektrokemisk and Alcan. The first of these is dated July 14, 1937, and recites that Elektrokemisk had the sole control of eight patents relating to self-baking electrodes and the manufacture thereof (referred to in the agreement as the Soderberg electrode system) and, in addition, some twenty-two patents relating to improvements on Soderberg electrodes. The first patents referred to included Nos. 212181, 215697, 216092 and 264997. In the latter group were Nos. 287700, 341667 and 346868. For the term of the licence which was until June 18, 1953, unless terminated earlier at the option of the licensee, the licensor granted to the latter a non-exclusive licence to make and to use for the production, treatment and manufacture of aluminum only the said patents, together with any patents for improvements which might be acquired by Elektrokemisk, without any addition to the royalty. It was by reason of this provision that Alcan became entitled to the benefit of the invention described in the Legeron Patent No. 383238. The stipulated royalty was 1\/10 cent U.S. currency per pound of aluminum, with the proviso that, if the price of gold in New York should during the term exceed the then price of $35 an ounce, Elektrokemisk had the option, by giving written notice at the end of each quarter, to claim as royalty for the next quarter either 1\/10 cent per pound or delivery of 11 pounds of aluminum per metric ton of aluminum produced under the licence. Due to the outbreak of the World War in September, 1939, the demand for aluminum increased tremendously and practically the entire output resulting from Alcan's operations was required for war purposes. Negotiations were carried on between Alcan and Elektrokemisk for a reduction of the agreed royalty and a change agreed upon which was embodied in a letter dated January 27, 1941, addressed to Alcan on behalf of the licensors. This letter stated that, of the patents listed in the preamble to the agreement of July 14, 1937, Patents Nos. 215697, 216092 and 212191 had expired but that four other Canadian patents obtained by Elektrokemisk, including one covering the Elektrokemisk absorption system, had been obtained since the date of the first agreement and were subject to its terms. The nonexclusive licence was changed to an exclusive licence and the rate of royalty was changed. For annual production of 40,000 metric tons the rate was that provided in the original agreement but, for production in excess of that amount up to 30,000 metric tons, the royalty was at the rate of two-thirds of that amount, and for any further annual increase the royalty was reduced by fifty per cent.\nOn March 23, 1943, the Deputy Minister of Munitions and Supply wrote Alcan informing them that, effective immediately, it was to make no payments by way of royalty or licence fees under the licence agreement, for the purpose of carrying out any contract or order placed with the company by that Department or by any of the Crown Companies, without the approval in writing of the Department. After referring to the Orders-in-Council in pursuance of which the notices were given, the Deputy Administrator said that it was the view of the Department that in many cases the rate of royalty, although perhaps not unreasonable under normal conditions, was altogether excessive having regard to the very substantially increased volume of production resulting from wartime requirements and the purposes for which the patent rights were being used, and gave further detailed instructions as to the manner in which the requirements of the Crown were to be complied with, and agreed on behalf of His Majesty in the right of Canada to indemnify the company against any claim which might be made against it in respect of the nonpayment of any royalties payable under any licence agreement.\nProduction of aluminum had continued to increase tremendously and, before the Deputy Minister had intervened, negotiations had been carried on between the parties for a further amendment of the licensing agreement. Near the end of 1942 Alcan had asked Elektrokemisk to consider placing a ceiling on the amount of the royalties and Georg Hagerup-Larssen, who had managed to escape from Norway and was representing Elektrokemisk in North America, after consultation with the representatives of the Norwegian Government, said that his employers were agreeable to fixing such a ceiling and offered to accept $250,000 as such, as the maximum amount to be paid per annum for royalties for the duration of the war. Alcan made a counteroffer of $175,000 but this was not accepted. On May 7, 1943, Hagerup-Larssen, on behalf of his employers, wrote to Alcan from New York offering to fix a maximum annual payment for any calendar year at $215,000, provided that such agreement should be approved by the Alien Property Custodian of Canada. The letter further stated that there were some minor points which would have to be dealt with in any amending agreement. As, however, Alcan had already received the order of the Deputy Minister of Munitions and Supply of March 23, 1943, nothing further was done with the matter. It may be noted that in the reply filed on behalf of the Crown to the petition it was admitted that the schedule of royalties provided by the agreement had been amended by providing a maximum figure of $215,000 but that in the reply filed by Alcan this was denied. The admission on behalf of the Crown was apparently made in error. The evidence showed that no such agreement had been made.\nThe obligation imposed upon the Crown by Orders-in-Council P.C. 6982 and 11081 is to pay to the owners of these patents such compensation as the Commissioner of Patents reports to be reasonable for their use during the period in question. The decision of the Commissioner is declared to be subject to appeal to the Exchequer Court. The Commissioner in conducting his inquiry is given all of the powers that are or may be given to a commissioner appointed under Part 1 of the Inquiries Act.\nThe petition addressed to the Commissioner by the Honourable the Secretary of State was filed on June 8, 1944, at a time when the Second World War was still in progress and Norway occupied by the enemy. At the time the inquiry was opened in March 1945 the case for the patent owner was presented without the evidence of Dr. Sem, whose knowledge of the inventions covered by the various patents was very much more extensive than that of any of the available witnesses, owing to his long association with Elektrokemisk. The case for the petitioner was supported by the evidence of Alan N. Mann, a member of the Bar of New York specializing in patent matters, Dr. Bruno Luzatto, an Italian engineer who had had a lengthy experience in the production of aluminum in Europe, and Georg Hagerup-Larssen, an electrical engineer who had been in the employ of Elektrokemisk since the year 1935.\nBy his report the Commissioner of Patents found that the obligation of the Crown was to pay compensation to the petitioner from October 1, 1941, and that fair and reasonable compensation was 1\/40 of a cent for each pound of aluminum produced by the Soderberg process, with a limit of $100,000 for any one year, this to be payable in Canadian currency. The Commissioner, in his carefully reasoned report, noted that Patents Nos. 212181, 215697 and 216092 had expired prior to January 27, 1941, when the amended agreement was made between Elektrokemisk and Alcan and, accordingly, that the inventions disclosed by them might be freely used and expressed the opinion that the five patents in respect of which the proceedings were taken, while being of material value, were less valuable than these three patents which had expired. As between the three expired patents and the other patents to the use of which the licensee was entitled under the two licensing agreements and the five patents, he assigned 75 per cent of the value to the former and 25 per cent to the latter.\nUpon the appeal to the Exchequer Court, leave was granted on the application of the petitioner to call Dr. Sem as a witness and his evidence was taken and considered by the learned President, together with that taken before the Commissioner of Patents in dealing with the matter. While the matter was contested before the President and has been argued before us, in my opinion the evidence of Dr. Sem was properly admitted under the powers vested in the Court by Rule 30 of the Exchequer Court Rules.\nBy the judgment delivered in the Exchequer Court from which the present appeal is taken, the decision of the Commissioner was set aside and the compensation awarded on the basis of the amending agreement of January 27, 1941, subject to a ceiling of $215,000 for each of the years 1942, 1943 and 1944 less, in the latter year, 1 per cent for the aluminum produced for civilian purposes. The learned President was apparently of the opinion that the maximum amount which had been proposed on behalf of Elektrokemisk in the letter of May 7, 1943, had been agreed to by Alcan.\nIn The King v. Irving Air Chute, Inc 2, three of the members of the Court considered the principle to be applied in fixing the compensation to be awarded to the owners of a patented invention by the Government of Canada under the provisions of s. 19 of the Patent Act, 1935. That section provides that the Government may at any time use any patented invention, paying to the patentee such sum as the Commissioner reports to be reasonable compensation for the use thereof. The principle applicable in settling the compensation under the Orders-in-Council in question in the present matter is, in my opinion, the same as in proceedings under s. 19. Two of the five members composing the Court expressed the opinion that, in fixing the amount, the Commissioner of Patents might properly adopt the rule recommended by the Royal Commission appointed in England to determine the nature of the awards to be made to inventors of whose inventions the Crown had made use during the period of hostilities, that a fair and reasonable consideration for such user should be such an amount of money as would be arrived at between a willing licensor and a willing licensee bargaining on equal terms. In my opinion, where the product manufactured under the licence is, as was the case with aluminum in the recent war, required almost exclusively for war purposes, the licensor should not be permitted to exploit the necessity of the nation by exacting an excessive royalty. On the other hand, he should not be required to accept less than a fair remuneration by reason of the fact that he is dealing with the Crown and may, accordingly, by the exercise of legislative power be required to take such amount as Parliament may see fit to allow, or indeed be paid nothing. I consider, however, the fact that the country was at war and that, accordingly, practically the sole customer for aluminum was the Government, is a matter to be considered in estimating what, under such circumstances, a willing licensor and a willing licensee who had only one customer for his product, would agree upon.\nIt is evident from the negotiations which were carried on at the end of 1942 and the early part of 1943 that Elektrokemisk realized that the rates provided by the amending agreement of January 27, 1941 would require payment of an amount in excess of what was reasonable under the circumstances and that this opinion was shared by Alcan, since the latter asked and the former was agreeable to restricting the total annual payment by a ceiling. It would appear from statements made by the witness Mann and by counsel for Alcan during the course of the hearing that, apart from the necessity of obtaining the approval of the Crown, the only obstacle to an agreement for fixing the ceiling at $215,000 was the question as to the liability for any increase in the then existing fifteen per cent tax on payments to non-residents, a stipulation which Elektrokemisk then offered to waive. I do not consider, however, that this amount can be accepted as a reasonable maximum annual payment.\nI am, with respect, unable to agree with the Commissioner of Patents as to the value to be assigned to the patents other than the five in respect of which the claim is made. There were twenty-five patents owned or controlled by Elektrokemisk which were referred to by number in the licence agreement of July 14, 1937. Evidence as to each of these patents was given by the witness Mann and there was no contradiction of his statements. The first of these, in order of date, was Canadian Patent No. 212181 and was for a sliding clamp which was used successfully with a metallurgical furnace but which, if ever of use in the production of aluminum, was entirely replaced by the mechanism described in the Torchet patents. Patent No. 215697, which was Soderberg's first attempt to make a self-baking carbon electrode by inserting an iron rod in the mass, was not directed to the recovery of aluminum and was not tried for that purpose anywhere and did not work for any purpose. The invention disclosed by Patent No. 216092 was, according to the evidence of Dr. Sem, found to be of no value in the production of aluminum. The Commissioner attached importance to the fact that in giving evidence Mann said that this patent No. 216092 could be said to be the foundation of the Soderberg system but, when his evidence is read together with that of Dr. Sem, it would appear that it might more properly be said that the method disclosed by this patent, like that described in Patent No. 215697, represented ineffective and unworkable attempts to produce a self-baking electrode. It was not until Westley discovered the method of introducing electricity into the mass by the employment of studs and Torchet's two patents changing the shape of the electrode and disclosing an effective method of successfully suspending it that a commercially feasible method of producing aluminum by the use of self-baked electrodes was found. The remaining patents enumerated, other than the five in question, disclosed inventions which were either less effective and accordingly were superseded by the Westley or Torchet methods, or were for use in smelting furnaces and not designed for use in the production of aluminum, or were not discovered to be of any value in the production of aluminum by Alcan. This appears to be demonstrated conclusively by the fact that none of them had been utilized between the time of the granting of the first licence agreement in 1937 up to the time of the hearing before the Commissioner in 1945.\nAt the time when Elektrokemisk agreed to the reduction in the rate of royalty for production in excess of 40,000 metric tons in January of 1941, Patents Nos. 212181, 215697 and 216092 had expired. This circumstance, however, had apparently nothing to do with the reduction of the royalty which was sought and granted only by reason of the great increase in the annual production of Alcan, due to the war. For the year 1939 the production of aluminum by the employment of the Soderberg system was something in excess of 68,000,000 lbs., which was increased in the following year to an amount in excess of 92,000,000 lbs. and was steadily increasing. While I think it is clearly shown by uncontradicted evidence that the three expired patents had not been of any value to Alcan since the contract of 1937 was made and that, accordingly, the fact that they had expired was a matter of no moment, the willingness of Alcan to pay the 1937 rate for the first 40,000 metric tons of its production shows that the company placed no value on these expired patents. As to the other patents mentioned in the original agreement, while conceivably the right to the use of some of them was of some value to Alcan, to consider that, at the time the amendment to the licence agreement was made in January 1941, they represented any substantial value in the eyes of the contracting parties is, in my opinion, error.\nThe production of Alcan by the employment of the Soderberg system was in the calendar year 1941 almost exactly double that of the year 1939. In 1942 it was in excess of 353,000,000 lbs., in 1943 in excess of 666,000,000 lbs. and in 1944 something more than 663,000,000 lbs. As indicated by the conduct of Elektrokemisk and Alcan, they were in agreement that a royalty calculated according to the amended rate provided in the agreement of January 27, 1941, resulted in the payment of an amount in excess of what was fair and reasonable. The learned President, considering that the ceiling of $215,000 had been agreed upon by the licensor and the licensee, concluded that compensation from October 1, 1941, should be computed at the royalty rate provided by the January 1941 agreement and the ceiling applied in any year when the royalty so computed exceeded $215,000.\nWhile, as I have pointed out, there was no agreement between Elektrokemisk and Alcan on a maximum payment of $215,000, it would appear that, apart from the necessity of obtaining the approval of the Minister, the only substantial difference between the parties themselves was as to the liability for taxation if the rate imposed on payments to non-residents exceeded 15 per cent. It must, however, be recognized that the royalty rate agreed to by Alcan was not merely for the right to use the five patents but the right to the use of any improvement made or acquired by Elektrokemisk during the term of the agreement which were to be communicated to Alcan as soon as the same were perfected and which might be made use of by it without payment of any additional royalties and the right to the extension of the term of the licence during the life of any such patents. In addition, the royalty payment agreed upon in January 1941 entitled Alcan to an exclusive licence for the employment of the Soderberg system in Canada. The right to the use of such improvement patents might well be of the greatest value to Alcan but this consideration, no doubt most material in the estimation of that company, is not relevant to the present inquiry. I am, therefore, with respect, unable to agree in the conclusion of the learned President of the Exchequer Court that the maximum annual payment should be fixed at an amount as high as $215,000.\nIn my opinion, it is in the interest of the due administration of justice that we should now determine the amount of the compensation to be paid. It is now nearly nine years since the petition was filed by the Secretary of State on behalf of Elektrokemisk. Witnesses have been brought from Europe and elsewhere to give evidence on the two hearings which have been held and, unless the parties should agree that the matter be determined by the Commissioner of Patents on the evidence taken before him in 1945 and the evidence of Dr. Sem subsequently taken in the Exchequer Court, heavy further expense will be necessarily incurred in again giving this evidence at Ottawa. It is not suggested by either party that there is any other evidence which would be of assistance in determining the amount of a reasonable compensation than that which is now before us.\nThe agreement of January 27, 1941, is evidence of the fact that both the licensor and the licensee were in agreement that the royalty should be at a lesser rate as production was increased. The negotiations which resulted in the letter of May 7, 1943, show that both parties considered that a maximum annual figure should be agreed upon. At the 1937 contract rate of 1\/10 of a cent per pound, the royalty paid by Alcan to Elektrokemisk in 1940 was $92,192.59. The January 27, 1941, amendment provided for the payment of a royalty of 1\/20 of a cent per pound for all production in excess of 70,000 metric tons, or roughly 154,350,000 lbs. Production for the year 1942 exceeded that amount by roughly 77,000,000 lbs. and in each of the years 1943 and 1944 by over 230,000,000 lbs. After giving all of the evidence tendered in this matter the most careful consideration, it is my opinion that a fair and reasonable royalty rate to be paid for the use of the patents in question from October 1, 1941 until the end of the year 1944 would be 1\/20 of a cent per pound of aluminum produced by the Soderberg system, subject to a ceiling of $175,000 in any one year. I would to this extent allow the appeal with costs. As I think the Commissioner of Patents erred in principle in fixing the amount of his award, I would allow to the petitioner the costs in the Exchequer Court. There should be no costs for or against Alcan. If the parties are unable to agree as to the amount of the production for the period October 1 to December 31, 1941, the matter may be spoken to.\nEstey J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the learned President of the Exchequer Court setting aside the report of the Commissioner of Patents fixing the compensation to be paid by the Government for the use of certain patents, as provided by Orders-in-Council P.C. 6982 of December 4, 1940, and P.C. 11081 of December 8, 1942, passed under and by virtue of the provisions of the War Measures Act. The learned President himself fixed the compensation and this appeal therefrom asks that the report of the Commissioner be restored.\nUnder date of July 14, 1937, Det Norske Aktieselskab for Elektrokemisk Industri (hereinafter referred to as Elektrokemisk) granted a licence to the Aluminum Company of Canada Limited (hereinafter referred to as Alcan) to use, in the production of aluminum, some thirty of its patents and such improvements as may be made in relation to those patents during the life of the agreement and two years thereafter. This licence or agreement was to continue until June 18, 1953, unless otherwise terminated as therein provided. The head office of Elektrokemisk is in Oslo, Norway, which country was occupied by the enemy on April 9, 1940, and the patents under the foregoing agreement thereafter became the property of the Secretary of State of Canada, acting in his capacity as Custodian of Enemy Property. On March 23, 1943, the Deputy Minister of Munitions and Supply, acting under authority of the above-mentioned Orders-in-Council, advised Alcan to make no further payment of royalties or licence fees under the above-mentioned licence agreement.\nAlcan, at the time this notice was received, had not paid royalties from and after October 1, 1941, and we are here concerned with fixing reasonable compensation from that date.\nIt is not the first step, by which aluminum oxide (Al2O3), or alumina, is taken from bauxite, but rather the electrode that is used in the process of breaking up aluminum oxide, or alumina, into its component parts of aluminum and oxygen, with which we are here concerned.\nAbout 1886, and almost simultaneously, Charles M. Hall in the United States and Paul T. H\u00e9roult in France discovered that by mixing the mineral creolyte, a fluorine compound, with alumina, and passing through this mixture an electric current of low voltage and high amperage, this mixture could be raised to a temperature of approximately 960 degrees centigrade and the molecule of aluminum oxide broken into its constituent elements, the aluminum going to one pole and the oxygen to the other. All this is usually done in what is variously styled a tank, a furnace, but more properly described as an electrolytic cell. One pole, or cathode, is at the bottom and the other pole, or anode, enters at or near the top. The electric current is, by an iron conveyor in the electrode, taken down into the mixture of creolyte and aluminum oxide, which is styled electrolyte. When the oxygen becomes separated from the aluminum it burns or consumes the carbon electrode at the lower end and forms carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.\nIt will be observed that the electricity serves a double purpose\u2014it generates the heat and provides the action of electrolysis. The creolyte, in this process, is a catalyst and, therefore, though necessary, remains unchanged. This electrode is made of carbonaceous material, usually coke and pitch. In the method discovered by Hall and H\u00e9roult it is baked separate and apart from the electrolytic cell and is, therefore, styled prebaked. In the electrolytic cell they use a number of these electrodes, which, because of the burning and consumption at the lower end, have to be, from time to time, lowered and eventually removed. Because of the necessity of maintaining a continuous process they cannot all be removed at the same time. Therefore, these electrodes are of varying lengths and their proper adjustment from time to time is a matter of difficulty. This process of prebaking, the constant adjustment and replacement, involves a substantial expense.\nSoderberg sought to find an electrode which could be baked in the same process and thereby avoid the substantial disadvantages and expense incident to prebaking and constant changing. He first succeeded in developing an electrode which could be baked in the same electrolytic cell and would be replenished at the top as it was burned or consumed at the bottom. This was called a self-baking continuous electrode. His discovery was about 1917 and it was patented in Canada as No. 215,697 (applied for February 18, 1918). In this process new carbonaceous material was added at the top of the electrode to compensate for that which was burned or used at the bottom. The amount burned in a day is relatively small and the baking process is effected as the electrode is lowered into the heat. One or more iron rods run down through the carbonaceous material to support the electrode and carry the electric current into the molten electrolyte. The expansion of the iron rod, or rods, when heated, made this patent impracticable for commercial purposes.\nSoderberg, however, continued his study and soon improved his earlier process, which he patented under No. 216,092 (applied for September 19, 1919). In this patent he eliminated the iron rods and introduced a cylindrical iron mantle or casing having ribs extending inwardly therefrom. He thereby provided a casing or container to hold the carbonaceous substance or paste and the ribs carried the electric current into the molten electrolyte. Under this process aluminum may be produced, but because the iron melts and falls into the aluminum the latter becomes contaminated. Mr. Mann described this patent as \"the foundation of the Soderberg system.\"\nThe third Soderberg patent, No. 212,181 (applied for February 2, 1921) provided greater efficiency in holding the electrode in place and lowering it. It was regarded as an improvement of the process.\nSoderberg's fourth patent, No. 264,997, eliminated the tamping of the paste in the casing by the introduction of sufficient binder to render it liquid.\nThen followed the Westly patent No. 287,700, which removed the projecting iron ribs and introduced removable iron studs inserted through holes in the casing. There are several rows of these studs which point inward and downward toward the molten electrolyte. The electric current is passed through the lower rows of these studs which are removed before they reach a point where the iron might drop into the aluminum pot. Furthermore, these studs projected outside of the casing and made possible the carriage of the current directly into the electrode.\nIn all of the foregoing patents the electrode is cylindrical in shape. Torchet's patent No. 346,868 introduced an electrode rectangular in shape, of a width not more than 43 inches, while in length no limit was specified. This patent provided a shorter path for the escape of the gases and thereby eliminated possibilities of disturbance in the aluminum that tended to lower the efficiency of the process.\nTorchet introduced, by patent No. 341,667, iron beams placed along each side of the electrode under the rows of studs in a manner that forms a frame around the electrode and the side beam and studs carry the weight of the electrode. This patent prevented the electrode from bulging and improved the method for lowering the electrode. It is referred to as a device for suspending continuous electrodes.\nLegeron, by patent No. 383,238, improved the Torchet suspension patent by providing, instead of a beam under the row of studs, a continuous wall of beams around the electrode. This provided greater strength around the electrode and made possible the use of a thin aluminum casing or mantle instead of the iron mantle. The first seven of the foregoing patents were included under the agreement of July 14, 1937, and the last, or Legeron, patent was added in accordance with the terms thereof. The parties in that agreement, in effect, classified these patents under two headings. In the first recital it is stated as follows:\nWhereas Elektrokemisk is the sole owner and\/or has sole control of the following letters patent of Canada relating to self-baking electrodes and manufacture thereof hereinafter called the Soderberg Electrode System.\nThe numbers of certain patents follow, including the Soderberg patents, or the first four of the eight patents which appellant says were used under the licence. These are Nos. 215,697, 216,092, 212,181 and 264,997. It is further stated:\nWhereas Elektrokemisk is also the sole owner and\/or has control of the following letters patent relating to improvements on Soderberg Electrodes.\nThen follow the numbers of certain patents, including three of the eight. These are Nos. 287,700 (Westly), 341,667 (Torchet) and 346,868 (Torchet). The remaining patent, or Legeron, No. 383,238, is mentioned in the letter of January 27, 1941 (amending royalties) as one of the patents added to the list since the agreement of July 14, 1937.\nThe parties to the agreement treated the first four as among the basic patents in the Soderberg electrode system and the latter three as improvements thereon which had been incorporated into that system. When the agreement of July 14, 1937, was made seven of these patents were outstanding. At all times material hereto the first three had expired and we are, therefore, only concerned with the compensation for the use of the last-mentioned five patents.\nThe Government, under the authority of the Orders-in-Council, directed the use of the foregoing patented inventions for war purposes; agreed to indemnify or protect Alcan against any proceedings for non-payment of the royalty under the agreement and became obligated to pay Elektrokemisk reasonable compensation for the use of these inventions. The Government was, therefore, not bound by the terms of the agreement of July 14, 1937. On the contrary, the record would indicate that the Government felt that in many agreements the royalties were, having regard to the increased production to meet war requirements, excessive; that all royalties upon patent inventions so used should be reviewed and some uniformity in respect of the basis of payment should be arrived at. In any event, it is the compensation under the Orders-in-Council, notwithstanding such an agreement may exist, that the Commissioner has to determine. The relevant provisions of the Orders-in-Council are identical and read as follows:\nHis Majesty shall pay to the owner or licensor of any such patent or registered industrial design which is valid such compensation as the Commissioner of Patents reports to be reasonable for the use aforesaid of the invention or design covered by such patent or registered industrial design * * * *\nThese provisions in respect to compensation are to the same effect as that in s. 19 of the Patent Act.\n19. The Government of Canada may, at any time, use any patented invention, paying to the patentee such sum as the Commissioner reports to be a reasonable compensation for the use thereof, \u2026 R.S., c. 150, s. 48.\nIt will be observed that s. 19 applies at all times, while the foregoing Orders-in-Council constitute an extension of s. 19 restricted to the conditions of war.\nThough the agreement was not binding upon the Government, its terms may be and were, in fact, considered by both the Commissioner and the learned President. Alcan therein promised to pay in United States currency a royalty of one-tenth of a cent per pound of aluminum produced. This term was amended when Alcan, enlarging its production facilities, requested and, under date of January 27, 1941, was granted a reduction. The above rate of one-tenth of a cent remained in effect in respect of each annual production up to 40,000 metric tons; over 40,000 and up to 70,000 tons the royalty was fixed at a rate of 66 2\/3 per cent of the said one-tenth of a cent and for a production over 70,000 tons the royalty to be at 50 per cent of the one-tenth of a cent.\nIn the latter part of 1942 Alcan sought a further reduction. Elektrokemisk then suggested a ceiling in any year of $250,000 and later of $215,000, while Alcan suggested $175,000. No amount was agreed upon, no doubt because of the letter from the Deputy Minister dated March 23, 1943, requesting that no further royalties be paid under the agreement. The ceiling then proposed would have applied to both war and civilian production. In 1941, 1942 and 1943 the entire production of Alcan was for war purposes and in 1944 1 per cent of the production was devoted to civilian needs.\nThe Commissioner adopted two methods of computing what he thought would at least approximate reasonable compensation. First, he considered that the thirty patents and those later added had each a value; that all of the patents other than the five here in question represented 75 per cent of the total royalty value and the five represented 25 per cent thereof. While, therefore, he fixed no specific value to any particular patent, the result was that he allowed 25 per cent of the royalty fixed by the parties on July 14, 1937, or a rate of one-fortieth of a cent per pound of aluminum produced. This he applied to the average production during the six-year period 1939-1944 and arrived at a figure of $82,500 per year.\nIn his second method, the Commissioner based his finding upon the evidence of Mr. Russell of Alcan, who deposed that the company had saved about .11 cents per pound at the company's Arvida plant in 1944. The Commissioner, therefore, concluded that 25 per cent of the saving based on the average production per year from 1939 to 1944 would be reasonable compensation for the use of these patents. Under this method he arrived at a sum of $90,500 per year.\nThe Commissioner then averaged the two amounts of $82,500 and $90,500 and arrived at a figure of $86,500 per year, which he determined as reasonable compensation, subject to a ceiling of $100,000 for any one year.\nIn His Majesty The King v. Irving Air Chute, 3, a judgment rendered subsequent to the Commissioner's report, this Court applied the test adopted as a general rule in Great Britain that the Government should pay as reasonable compensation that sum \"arrived at between a willing licensor and a willing licensee bargaining on equal terms.\" This rule contemplates bargaining in what is usually referred to as an open market and as applied to this case it eliminates the inclusion of any amount in the compensation that might be exacted because of the necessity of the Government under the circumstances of war. While in the determination of such an amount the information and computations before the Commissioner may be of assistance, it cannot be concluded that upon the evidence the Commissioner applied that principle. I am, therefore, in agreement with the learned President that the Commissioner, in fixing the compensation, did not apply the proper principle.\nThe learned President found reasonable compensation for the use of the five patents to be the schedule of royalties agreed upon and set out in the letter of January 27, 1941, subject to a ceiling or limit of $215,000 in any one year. He stated:\nPrimarily, the use of the inventions was worth what the parties were willing to pay and receive for it. There can be no doubt that the revised royalty and ceiling were arrived at between a willing licensor and a willing licensee bargaining on equal terms with full knowledge of the value of the inventions that were being used.\nThe revised royalty referred to is that set forth in the letter of Elektrokemisk to Alcan dated January 27, 1941. This revision or reduction was granted as a result of a request from Alcan at a time when it was enlarging its productive capacity. Alcan was already obligated under the agreement of July 14, 1937. Aluminum, in the circumstances of war, was a necessity and, therefore, while Alcan might request, actually it was in the position where it had to accept whatever reduction, if any, Elektrokemisk might make. The latter did, in fact, make a substantial reduction, but, with the greatest possible respect, these parties cannot be held to have been then negotiating as willing licensors and licensees within the meaning of Irving Air Chute, supra.\nMoreover, the learned President was apparently of the opinion that the parties had agreed on the ceiling of $215,000. With great respect, I do not think the evidence bears out that conclusion. Alcan did approach Elektrokemisk in 1943 asking the second reduction. In the course of negotiations Elektrokemisk suggested $250,000 and subsequently a ceiling of $215,000. Alcan, on its part, sug- gested $175,000, but no agreement was arrived at, apparently because the Government had served notice that no further royalties should be paid.\nIt cannot be overlooked that Alcan and Elektrokemisk entered into the agreement of July 14, 1937, appreciating that an improvement patent ought not to be used without a licence or permission being obtained for the use of the basic patent. Lynch and Henry Wilson & Company Ld. v. John Phillips & Company 4. As already pointed out, they, in effect, classified as improvement patents four of the five here in question. The fact that the basic patents may have, as here, expired and thereby become public property does not alter or affect the value of the improvement patents. While it may be conceded that the inventions under the improvement patents may have been the major factors in making the self-baking continuous electrode commercially successful, it is difficult to attribute to them the entire value of the system. Mr. Mann, called on behalf of the respondent, stated:\nThis patent No. 216,092 can be said to be the foundation of the Soderberg system.\nDoctor Sem, in the course of his evidence, stated:\nThe basic invention of Mr. Soderberg is the foundation of the self-baking electrode as developed by us.\nMoreover, Doctor Sem, in 1938, in an article entitled \"Soderberg Electrodes in the Production of Aluminum,\" wrote:\nThe first commercial plant dates back as far as 1925 but only lately has the equipment been fully developed to all the requirements of the aluminum industry.\nThese statements indicate that the basic patents were of value and support the view that the entire value of the system cannot be attributed to the five patents in question.\nMoreover, the original agreement of July 14, 1937 had to do with some thirty patents, together with any improvements effected thereon. While the evidence shows that only eight were used, it does disclose that in certain contingencies others might have been used. What, however, is of greater significance is that Alcan was, under that agreement, purchasing the right to use, in the production of aluminum, over a period of fifteen years, all of these patents and the improvements that might be effected in relation thereto. The same right was preserved to Alcan for a period of about twelve years when, on January 27, 1941, the royalty was revised. Alcan no doubt entered into the agreement of July 14. 1937, with the intent of forthwith using certain of these patents, but it also intended to protect itself by the inclusion of the others and the acquisition of the right to use the improvements that, during the currency of the agreement, might be effected in relation to all of these patents. The basis upon which the consideration would be determined would, in such an agreement, be quite different from that of ascertaining reasonable compensation for the use of five of these patents over a period of a few years.\nThe evidence justifies the conclusion that there is a relation between the savings effected by the patented inventions and the amount of the royalty. Mr. Russell of Alcan made a computation which would indicate that the amount determined by the learned President could not be accepted as reasonable. Counsel for respondent pressed the comparisons with royalties paid and savings effected by the Aluminum Company of America. These, of course, may well be considered, but it must be conceded that circumstances in the two countries are not identical. With the greatest possible respect, it would appear that the compensation has not been arrived at in accord with the principle underlying Irving Air Chute, supra, and must be set aside.\nAt the hearing of this appeal a question was raised as to the jurisdiction of the learned President to admit, upon the hearing of the appeal before him, the evidence of Doctor Sem. The recital of the first of the foregoing Orders-in-Council refers to s. 19 of the Patent Act and, as already stated, may be regarded as an extension of or, in effect, an amendment to s. 16.\nIt would, therefore, appear that it was intended that under the Orders-in-Council, as under s. 19, the provisions of s. 17 of the Patent Act would apply. S. 17 reads as follows:\n17. In all cases where an appeal is provided from the decision of the Commissioner to the Exchequer Court under this Act, such appeal shall be had and taken pursuant to the provisions of the Exchequer' Court Act and the rules and practice of that Court. Rule 30 of the Exchequer Court Rules, under which the learned President admitted the evidence, reads as follows:\nThe Court in any appeal shall have full discretionary power to receive and hear further evidence.\nThat the Exchequer Court had authority to enact such a rule is apparent from s. 87(c) of the Exchequer Court Act. Section 87(c) reads:\n87. The President of the Exchequer Court may, from time to time, make general rules and orders,\n* * *\n(c) For the effectual execution and working in respect to proceedings in such Court or before such judge, of any Act giving jurisdiction to such Court or judge and the attainment of the intention and objects of any such Act;\nMoreover, s. 88(2) provides that copies of all rules and orders made by the President of the Exchequer Court shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament within ten days of the opening of the session next after the making thereof. Rule 30 was included in the rules of April 21, 1931, and, therefore, comes within the provisions of s. 88(3) which reads as follows:\n88(3) All such rules and orders and every portion of the same not inconsistent with the express provisions of any Act shall have and continue to have force and effect as if herein enacted, unless during such session an address of either the Senate or House of Commons shall be passed for the repeal of the same or any portion thereof, in which case the same or such portion shall be and become repealed: \u2026\nRule 30 is not inconsistent with the express provisions of any Act and is, therefore, by virtue of s. 88(3), entitled to full force and effect as if enacted as part of the Exchequer Court Act. It would, therefore, appear that Rule 30 was competently made.\nThe learned President, who had dealt with and reviewed a similar application in the Irving Air Chute Case, supra, in the present case found that circumstances were disclosed which, in the exercise of his discretion, justified the admission of the evidence.\nThe practice of this Court would require that this matter be referred back for the purpose of determining the compensation as directed by the Orders-in-Council. The circumstances here are, however, quite exceptional and justify this Court in fixing the compensation. I therefore, adopt the computation thereof as set out in the reasons of my brother Locke. The appeal should be allowed. The appeal before the learned President was justified and I would not disturb his order for costs in the Exchequer Court. The appellant should have its costs in this Court. There should be no costs for or against Alcan.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F. P.

Insurance was issued upon premium notes upon which a cash payment was secured prior to the issuance of the policy and the notes were subject to further assessments to meet losses and expenses incurred during the term of the policy. Where the amount collected in cash exceeded the current year's losses and expenses the surplus became part of the reserve fund. In 1947 the appellant transferred, as provided by s. 249 of the Insurance Act, a surplus of $6,103.69 to its reserve fund. This amount was assessed under s. 3(1) of The Income War Tax Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 97, as amended, as taxable income, constituting an annual net profit or gain. Held: The surplus was accumulated as directed by The Insurance Act, 1937 not in pursuance of a profit making enterprise but in furtherance of a mutual insurance plan carried on by the appellant in. the interest of its members and the fund could not be applied, except on the order of the Governor in Council, to any purpose other than the settlement of claims or other liabilities. On a winding-up the surplus, if any, under the provisions of The Winding-Up Act (R.S.N.B. 1927, c. 97) and The Insurance Act, 1937 read together, would be returned to the members of the Company.

By these letters patent the applicants, all of whom were farmers living in that province, were created a body corporate and politic with all the rights and powers given by Part II of the said Act and The Insurance Act, 1937 (c. 44: S. of N.B., 1937). The purposes of the company are stated to be:\nTo undertake contracts of insurance against loss by fire, lightning or explosion upon farm and other non-hazardous property upon the premium note plan, subject to the provisions of Part II of the \"New Brunswick Companies Act and the Insurance Act 1937.\" The company has no capital stock.\nThe Companies Act of the Province, as enacted in the Revised Statutes of 1927, was amended by the addition of Part II by c. 19 of the Statutes of 1937. Ss. 129 to 153 of the amendment under the heading \"Provincial Mutual Insurance Companies\" provide for the incorporation of such companies. Companies incorporated under this Part have no shares but each person, partnership or corporation insured under a policy is declared to be a member thereof. Any five or more persons residents of and owning real estate in any county in the province may apply to the Superintendent of Insurance appointed under the provisions of The Insurance Act, 1937, for his approval to promote the organization of such a company and, with his approval, organization may be undertaken. After insurance has been subscribed by fifty or more subscribers to an amount not less than $100,000, the promoters may call an organization meeting and, if so authorized, petition the Provincial Secretary Treasurer for incorporation under a name which must include the words \"Mutual Fire Insurance Company.\" Each subscriber to the subscription book for the organization of the company is required, within three weeks from the date of the incorporation or such further period as may be allowed by the Superintendent, to apply for a contract of insurance in an amount not less than the amount subscribed for by him, and is subject to a penalty for failure to do so. Each member not being in default for any dues, fees or assessments is entitled to one vote at all meetings which he attends. The directors must be members of the company in good standing and insured by it for at least $1,000 or be an accredited representative of a partnership or corporation, being a member in good standing insured for at least that amount. Companies so incorporated are empowered to make by-laws not inconsistent with the Act or The Insurance Act, 1987 or the Regulations, for the management of its business, regarding the regulation of the tariff of fees, the levying of assessments and the forms, terms and conditions of its insurance policies, and generally for all matters incident to its incorporation or necessary for carrying out its purposes, but no such by-law is of any force or effect until the same is approved by the Superintendent. His approval is likewise required to the alteration, repeal or re-enactment of any of the by-laws. By-laws passed by the Board of Directors may also be enacted but become effective only with approval of the Superintendent. S. 142 provides that any member may, with the consent of the directors, withdraw from the company upon such terms as the directors may lawfully prescribe, and upon such withdrawal his policy shall be cancelled but he shall nevertheless be liable to be assessed for and pay his proportion of \"losses, expenses and reserve\" to the time of cancelling the policy.\nThe Insurance Act of 1937 deals with the subject of insurance in all its branches within the province and Part XII under the heading \"Provincial Mutual Insurance Companies\" by ss. 226 to 249, both inclusive, deals particularly with the operation of such companies. S. 129 of Part II of the Companies Act provides that the word \"company\" in that part shall mean a \"provincial mutual company\" as defined in s. 2 of the Insurance Act, which defines such a company as meaning a mutual insurance corporation incorporated by or under an Act of the Legislature. S-s. 40 of s. 2 of the Insurance Act reads:\u2014\nMUTUAL INSURANCE\nMutual insurance means a contract of insurance, in which the consideration is not fixed or certain at the time the contract is made but is to be determined at the termination of the contract or at fixed periods during the term of the contract according to the experience of the insurer in respect of all similar contracts whether or not the maximum amount of such consideration is predetermined.\nThe word \"member\" where used in Part XII is defined as meaning a person holding a contract of insurance from a provincial mutual insurance company. Such companies are prohibited from undertaking any risk in respect of any one property or risk subject to the hazard of a single fire, for an amount greater than $3,000 unless it be reinsured to an amount sufficient to reduce the net liability of the insurer to that amount. However, with permission of the Governor in Council, risks not exceeding $5,000 may be undertaken. The form, terms and conditions of the applications and policies of insurance are to be determined by the Board of Directors but are subject to the approval of the Superintendent. Each application and policy is required to bear the words Mutual company\u2014subject to pro rata distribution of assets and losses.\ntogether with a statement of the company's total reserves as of the preceding 31st of December. The Board may, subject to the provisions of the Act and with the approval of the Superintendent, adopt a \"tariff of rates for premium notes\" and vary the same from time to time. A company may accept premium notes for insurance and may issue policies thereon and such notes must be assessed for the losses and expenses of the insurer in the manner provided by the Act. The form of such notes must be approved by the Superintendent. The Board is required to demand and collect a cash payment on the note at the time of the application for the insurance of such amount as may be fixed by by-law and if the amount so collected in cash is more than sufficient to pay any losses and expenses during the maintenance of the policy, any surplus becomes part of the reserve fund. The Board is further authorized to make assessments upon premium notes before losses have happened or expenses been incurred and any surplus from any such assessment becomes part of the reserve fund. All assessments on premium notes are required to be made by the Board with the approval of the Superintendent, such assessments to be made at such intervals and of such sums as the Board determines and the Superintendent approves to be necessary to meet losses, expenses and reserve of the insurer during the currency of the policies on which the notes were given. If any assessment in respect of a policy be not paid within thirty days after the mailing of the notice of assessment, the policy becomes null and void as against the insured as to any claim for losses occurring during the time the policy holder is in default. If the policy be cancelled or avoided by the company, the liability of the insured on his premium note ceases from the date of such cancellation or avoidance in respect of any loss that occurs thereafter, but the insured shall nevertheless be liable to pay his proportion of the losses and expenses of the insurer up to that time and, upon payment of his proportion of all assessments then payable or to become payable in respect of losses and expenses sustained up to that time, he shall be entitled to a return of his premium note. The limit of the liability of the member under the premium note plan is the face amount of the note. Under the sub-heading \"Reserve and Guarantee Fund\" s. 249 provides:\u2014\n249. (1) The insurer shall form a reserve fund to consist of all money which remains on hand at the end of each year after payment of expenses and losses; and in addition shall levy an annual assessment, not exceeding twenty-five per centum, and not less than five per centum, on the premium notes held by the insurer until such reserve reaches the sum of five hundred dollars for every one hundred thousand dollars of the first one million dollars insurance in force, and three thousand dollars for each additional one million dollars or part thereof in force, up to which minimum level it shall be maintained, and for such purpose the insurer shall thereafter levy annually such adequate assessment as the Superintendent approves.\n(2) Such reserve fund may, from time to time, be applied by the board to pay off such liabilities of the insurer as are not provided for out of the ordinary receipts for the same or any succeeding year.\n(3) The reserve fund shall be the property of the insurer as a whole and no member shall have a right to claim any share or interest therein in respect of any payment contributed by him towards it; nor shall such fund be applied or dealt with by the insurer or the board other than in paying its creditors, except on the order of the Governor in Council.\nS. 61 of the Act permits an insurer to invest its reserve in securities in which trustees are by law permitted to invest trust funds, with a limitation as to the amount permitted to be invested in mortgages on land and requires that uninvested funds shall be kept on deposit in the name of the insurer in a post office, provincial savings bank or chartered bank of Canada.\nThe by-laws adopted by the company state that:\u2014\nThe object of the company is a mutual association of the members thereof for the relief of each other in case of loss by fire or lightning.\nThey provide that the company may insure against loss or damage by fire or lightning isolated dwelling houses, farm buildings, churches and school houses and any other useful isolated non-hazardous buildings and the ordinary contents of such buildings when situate within the Province of New Brunswick, but shall not insure mercantile risks. No property may be insured for more than two-thirds of its value. Each person insuring for the first time is required to pay a Membership Fee of $1. Schedules of rates on all isolated buildings 100 feet distant from all others not part of the premises, with their contents, are fixed at a premium note of 2 per cent of the amount of the policy for three years with a cash payment thereon of one-half of the amount after discount, if any, has been allowed. On public halls with their contents and rented buildings of the first class 100 feet distant from all others not part of the premises, the rates are fixed at a premium note of 2\u00bd per cent with a cash payment of one-half of that amount, less any discount.\nThe balance sheet of the appellant company for the year ending December 31, 1947, shows its assets to consist of bonds to the value of $37,000, accrued bond interest $319.98, cash to the amount of $4,936.01 and stirrup pumps valued at $220. As against this, liabilities in respect of unearned premiums are shown as being $19,824.51, an amount classified as Reserve Fund $6,103.69 and a further amount as Surplus in the sum of $16,557.79.\nThe profit and loss account for the year shows income totalling $16,050.27 made up of premiums earned, membership fees, interest and an item designated \"Special Permits\". The expenses totalled $9,946.50, this including fire losses of $6,838 agents' fees and commissions $1,671.87, the balance being made up of salaries, directors' fees, printing and stationery and other incidental expenses. The excess of receipts, including premiums earned, over the disbursements was $6,103.69, which amount was transferred to the Reserve Fund pursuant to the provisions of s. 249 of the Provincial Insurance Act.\nNo question arises regarding the interest earned upon the company's investment of its reserve fund which is conceded to be taxable. The dispute is as to the balance on hand at the end of the year's operations resulting from the fact that the cash premium receipts and the amounts assessed upon the premium notes exceeded the outgoings for losses and other necessary expenses.\nThe appellant was assessed to income tax upon $6,103.69, the amount transferred to the reserve fund, and on the taxpayer filing a notice of objection the Minister affirmed the assessment. The appeal to the Income Tax Appeal Board was allowed. Mr. Justice Graham, with whom Mr. Fabio Monet, Q.C. agreed, considered that the operations of the company did not result in any profit and that the surplus resulting from the year's operations was not income, within the meaning of that term as defined by s-s. 1 of s. 3 of the Income War Tax Act, as amended, other than the amount received from bond interest. Mr. W. S. Fisher, Q.C., the third member of the Board, dissented.\nThe appeal of the Minister to the Exchequer Court was allowed. Mr. Justice Hyndman considered that the company was not in essence a genuine mutual company, as defined by the authorities, being of the opinion that the essential feature of such concerns was that the contributors to the funds must also be participators in the surplus, and that this was excluded in the present matter by s-s. 3 of s. 249 of the Insurance Act. The learned trial Judge concluded that there was no real distinction between the appellant company and any ordinary fire insurance company and that the surplus must be regarded as a profit or gain to it and not to the members.\nS-s. 1 of s. 3 of the Income War Tax Act, in so far as it affects the present matter, reads:\u2014\nFor the purposes of this Act \"income\" means the annual net profit or gain \u2026 being profits from a trade or commercial or financial or other business or calling \u2026 and shall include the interest, dividends or profits directly or indirectly received from money at interest upon any security or without security or from stocks or from any other investment, and whether such gains or profits are divided or distributed or not.\nThe question is whether the surplus resulting from the amounts received from premiums paid in cash at the time the insurance is effected and from assessments being in excess of that required for the company's operations is a profit or gain. For the Minister the contention is that accepted by Mr. Justice Hyndman that by the very terms of the Insurance Act the reserve fund is the property of the company and not of its members: accordingly since its receipts for the year have exceeded its expenditures the balance remaining is, of necessity, a profit or gain to the company since its assets have been increased to that extent.\nThe question of the liability to income tax of the surplus funds of mutual insurance companies has been considered in several cases in England. In New York Life Insurance Company v. Styles 4, the question of the liability of such a fund resulting from payments of premiums by the participating shareholders of the company was considered. The company had no shares or shareholders, the only members being the holders of participating policies, each of whom was entitled to a share of the assets and liable to all losses. A calculation was made by the company of the probable death rate among the members and of probable expenses and other liabilities and the premiums charged were commensurate therewith. Annually an account was taken and the greater part of the surplus of such premiums over expenditures was returned to the policy holders as bonuses, either by addition to the sums insured or in reduction of future premiums and the remainder of the surplus was carried forward as funds in hand to the credit of the general body of the members. It was conceded that the income derived by the company from investments and from transactions with persons not members was assessable. It was held that no part of the premium income received under participating policies was liable to be assessed to income tax. The case, on the face of it, is distinguishable from the present in that the entire surplus resulting annually from the transactions of the company with participating shareholders was either returned to them, utilized for their benefit by increasing the amount of the insurance, or held for their benefit, to be accounted for thereafter. That an operation of this nature was mutual insurance could not be questioned. Lord Watson, speaking of the plan, said (pp. 393-4):\u2014\nThe individuals insured and those associated for the purpose of receiving their dividends, and meeting policies when they fall in, are identical; and I do not think that their complete identity can foe destroyed, or even impaired, by their incorporation. The corporation is merely a legal entity which represents the aggregate of its members; and the members of the appellant company are its participating policy-holders.\nWhen a number of individuals agree to contribute funds for a common purpose, such as the payment of annuities, or of capital sums, to some or all of them, on the occurrence of events certain or uncertain, and stipulate that their contributions, so far as not required for that purpose, shall be repaid to them, I cannot conceive why they should be regarded as traders, or why contributions returned to them should be regarded as profits \u2026 In my opinion, a member of the appellant company, when he pays a premium, makes a rateable contribution to a common fund, in which he and his co-partners are jointly interested, and which is divisible among them, at the times and under the conditions specified in their policies. Lord Bramwell, who was of the same opinion, said in part (pp. 394-5) :\u2014\nThe appellants do not carry on a profession, trade, employment, or vocation from which profits or gains arise or accrue within the meaning of the Income Tax Act \u2026 I speak, of course, of the mutual insurance business. They are a corporation, but the case may be, as is admitted, dealt with as though they were an unincorporated association of individuals. Take it that they were; take it that half-a-dozen persons so associated themselves at the beginning of the year; they each put into a common purse \u00a310, to be given to the executors of any one who dies, or divided, if more than one dies, among the executors of those having died. In fact, no one dies, and the money is returned, or carried on for the next year. Is it possible to say that this is an association for the purpose of profit, or that it has made any profit?\nLord Herschell, after referring to the fact that the Attorney-General had conceded that the fact that the persons (thus associating themselves together for the purpose of mutual insurance had been incorporated was immaterial and that the case might be treated as though it were an association of individuals unincorporated, said that persons who agree to contribute to a common fund for mutual insurance would not in ordinary parlance be regarded as carrying on a trade or vocation for the purpose of earning profit, and continuing (pp. 409-10) :\u2014\nLet us see how the so-called profit arises. It is due to the premiums which the members are required to pay being in excess of what is necessary to provide for the requisite payments to be made upon the deaths of members, and not being, as the case states they were intended to be, commensurate therewith. This may result either from the contributions having, owing to an erroneous estimate or overcaution, been originally fixed at a higher rate than was necessary, or from the death rate being lower than was anticipated. Can it be properly said that, under these circumstances, the association of mutual insurers had earned a profit? The members contribute for a common object to a fund which is their common property; it turns out that they have contributed more than is needed, and therefore more than ought to have been contributed by them, for this object, and accordingly their next contribution is reduced by an amount equal to their proportion of this excess. I am at a loss to see how this can be considered as a \"profit\" arising or accruing to them from a trade or vocation which they carry on.\nLord Macnaghten who agreed that the surplus was not taxable was also of the opinion that the fact that the insured who were also the insurers carried on their business through the medium of a company had been properly treated as immaterial. In Jones v. South West Lancashire Coal Owners' Association 5, the manner of operation of the Association, whose liability to taxation was considered, more closely resembled those of the present appellant. A colliery company was a member of an Association, a company limited by guarantee, the sole activity of which was the indemnity of its members against compensation in respect of fatal accidents to their workmen. The Association was a mutual concern, every person indemnified by it being a member, and calls were made by it and paid by the members for insurance, and nothing more. Out of these calls a general fund was built up to meet claims for indemnity and a reserve fund was also created the interest earned upon which might be applied in diminution of the calls upon members. It is of importance to note that if a member retired from the Association he was entitled to receive back a proportion only of what was called his share of the reserve fund, the balance being retained. Rowlatt J., by whom the case was tried, held that the principle stated in the New York Life case was applicable. As to the reserve fund, he said (p. 47) :\u2014\nNo doubt, as the money is not distributed year by year, and calls are not limited to actual losses, but to enable a fund to be built up, it may in a sense be said that the Association has a fund which it holds as a company and which it does not divide among all the people who have built it up, inasmuch as members may come in when the fund has been largely built up, and so there is a fund which does not go back to those people who subscribed it individually.\nand, after saying that, in his opinion, this did not distinguish the case from the New York Life case, said (p. 48):\u2014\nThe broad principle was there laid down that, if the interest in the money does not go beyond the people or the class of people who subscribed it, then, just as there is no profit earned by the people subscribing, if they do the thing for themselves, so there is none if they get a company to do it for them.\nThis decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal and by the House of Lords. Two questions had been decided by Rowlatt J., the first being as to whether the colliery company was entitled to charge the amount of the levies made by the Association as an expense of its business and as to this he had decided that such payments were properly deductible. In the reasons for his judgment on the appeal, Lord Hanworth M.R. said in part (p. 58):\u2014\nIt is said that once the first case is decided in the way it has been, that these moneys were absolutely paid over by the insured to the Association for the purpose of obtaining insurance, then the moneys that have been so paid over become the property of the Association, and that the Association ought then in its turn to be liable to income tax in respect of the excess that they have received. It appears to me that there is no inconsistency in saying that both judgments of Rowlatt J. are right. True, in the first case the sum is deducted because it represents the cost of obtaining the insurance by the assured, but it does not necessarily follow that the money received by the Association is as to a part of it the reaping of a reward or gain by the Association. It must still be looked at from the point of view of mutual insurance. Regarded as such, the Association does not make a profit or gain which is of the nature or character which subjects it to income tax.\nScrutton L.J., after referring to the fact that if a member withdrew he only got back part of his share of the reserve fund, the balance being retained by the Association, considered this did not affect the matter and that no part of the accumulations added to the reserve fund from year to year were subject to taxation.\nThe report of the proceedings in the House of Lords 6, shows that the same arguments now made on behalf of the Minister were made by the Attorney-General and there rejected. It was contended that since the company was carrying on a trade or business, within the meaning of the Income Tax Act, 1918, the surplus of the receipts over the expenditures was profit and that it was immaterial how that profit was applied, that the company owned the contributions of the members in response to calls and the reserve fund belonged to the company and was available to creditors and that no individual member had an interest in it. Viscount Cave considered that the decision of the House in the New York Life case (supra) completely covered the case. The accumulated reserve fund of the Coal Owners' Association exceeded \u00a3150,000. A passage from the Lord Chancellor's judgment reads (p. 832) :\u2014\nIn this case, as in the New York Life Insurance Co.'s case, 7, there are no shareholders interested, and the whole of the yearly surplus remains to the credit of the members, and must either be applied to meeting their future claims or be returned to them on retirement. Sooner or later, in meal or in malt, the whole of the company's receipts must go back to the policy holders as a class, though not precisely in the proportions in which they have contributed to them; and the association does not in any true sense make a profit out of their contributions. While the first sentence of the above quotation would indicate that Lord Cave thought that the entire amount contributed to the reserve fund was refunded, the concluding sentence makes it clear, I think, that he had not failed to note that the contrary was the case and that less might be returned than had been paid in. The important point was that the whole of the fund must go back to the members as a class. By this, I assume he meant that this would occur on a winding-up or in the event of the discontinuance of business by the Association.\nIn Ayrshire Employers Mutual Insurance Association, Ltd. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue 8, the Association had as its principal object the insuring of its members on the mutual principle against claims arising out of accidents to their workmen. By levies upon the members for premiums in excess of the amounts required, a reserve fund had been accumulated a proportion of the revenue from which was credited to each member. Members' accounts were cleared annually and when an account showed a surplus, part was returned to the member as a bonus the balance being retained by the Association. The articles provided that a retiring member, unless he was giving up his business, forfeited half of his contribution to the surplus assets. Where, however, he was giving up business, or if his membership was terminated by the Association, he was entitled to recover his whole contribution. The decision in Jones v. South West Lancashire Coal Owners' Association 9 was applied, the Court of Session deciding that the transactions between the Association and its members did not give rise to a profit subject to income tax. It is to be noted that in the course of the judgment of Lord Fleming (p. 427) he referred to a passage from a judgment of Lord Macmillan in Municipal Mutual Insurance v. Hills 10, where, after referring to the principle on which the surpluses arising in the conduct of a mutual insurance scheme are not taxable as profits, he said in part:\u2014\nThe cardinal requirement is that all the contributors to the common fund must be entitled to participate in the surplus and that all the participators in the surplus must be contributors to the common fund; in other words there must be complete identity between the contributors and the participators. If this requirement is satisfied the particular form which the association takes is immaterial. Lord Fleming did not appear to construe this as meaning that it was essential that the contributors to the reserve fund should be entitled to have refunded to them the full amount of their contributions, in view of the term of the by-laws referred to above. That portion of the argument directed to s. 31(1) of the Finance Act, 1933 does not touch the present matter.\nThe appeal to the House of Lords was dismissed 11. Lord Thankerton who, alone of the Law Lords, referred to what had been said by Lord Macmillan in the Municipal Mutual Insurance case and did not mention the provision in the by-laws whereby a member withdrawing received back only one-half of his contributions to the surplus, considered that the appeal failed.\nLord Macmillan, after referring to an argument advanced on behalf of the commissioners that a surplus arising from transactions of the company with non-members was taxable, said (p. 640) :\nThe hypothesis is that a surplus arising on the transactions of a mutual insurance company with non-members is taxable as profits or gains of the company. But unfortunately for the Inland Revenue the hypothesis is wrong. It is not membership or non-membership which determines immunity from or liability to tax; it is the nature of the transactions. If the transactions are of the nature of mutual insurance, the resultant surplus is not taxable whether the transactions are with members or with non-members.\nIn my opinion, the business carried on by the appellant company in the taxation year 1947 is properly described as that of mutual insurance. The purpose of the company, as declared by the letters patent, is that of insuring on the premium note plan, subject to the provisions of Part II of the Companies Act and of The Insurance Act, 1987. A premium note is defined by s-s. 48 of s. 2 of the latter statute to mean:\u2014\nAn instrument given as consideration for insurance whereby the maker undertakes to pay such sum or sums as are legally demanded by the insurer, the aggregate of such sums not to exceed an amount specified in the instrument and includes any undertaking to pay such sums regardless of the form thereof and whether or not accompanied by a deposit of money or security. The premium notes taken by the appellant company conform to the first part of this definition. It is of the essence of such a plan that each member insuring with the company will to a maximum figure (being the principal amount of the note) and, from time to time during its currency, to the extent of the balance which may become payable under it, share the risk of loss by fire or lightning by any of the members with all the members of the company. Such a plan falls within the definition of \"Mutual Insurance\" in s-s. 40 of s. 2 of the Act and, in addition, within the generally accepted meaning of the term.\nI think it is true that the question does not differ from that which would arise had those persons who were members of the appellant company for the year 1947 entered into an agreement among themselves each to contribute his proportionate share of the loss by fire suffered by any of them to an agreed amount, the members' liability being limited to, say, the sum of $20, each member to contribute part of this sum in cash in order to pay expected losses and the expenses of carrying out the plan, assessments to be made upon the notes for further amounts when required by a committee of the members, any surplus resulting from the cash payments and such assessments to be placed at the end of the year in a reserve fund to the credit of the members, any member withdrawing from the plan during the year to forfeit any interest he might have in the amount so accumulated. Had this plan been followed it would be quite impossible, in my opinion, to sustain a contention that such a fund represented a profit or was taxable income if distributed among the members, except perhaps to the extent that they might individually participate or be entitled to participate in the portion of such surplus contributed by members who had withdrawn. That would be a truly mutual plan of insurance and I think the situation is not changed when the members, availing themselves of the provisions of the Companies Act and The Insurance Act, 1937, carry out such a plan through the medium of an incorporated company.\nThe plan provided by the terms of Part II of the Companies Act and the relevant sections of the Insurance Act enables persons wishing to associate with others in such an enterprise to substitute the covenant of a separate legal entity for the individual covenant of the proposed members. It is clear that in enacting this legislation it was contemplated that the persons who would take advantage of its provisions would be unlikely to be skilled in insurance matters and perhaps in financial matters involving the undertaking of considerable financial obligations. Accordingly, after organization in the manner required by the Companies Act, the operations were made subject to the supervision of the Superintendent of Insurance and, inter alia, the forms to be used and the extent of the assessments to be made upon the premium notes made subject to his approval. While such a company could, no doubt, operate by assessing its members upon their premium notes from time to time as losses occurred, the Legislature apparently considered it prudent to require the establishment of a reserve fund to the amount provided in s. 249 of the Insurance Act, to be available to pay the liabilities of the company to the extent that the ordinary receipts were insufficient. Much importance has been attached in argument to the fact that by s-s. 3 of that section the reserve fund is declared to be the property of the insurer. Since it is the company that incurs the obligation to the members by issuing policies of insurance, of necessity the reserve fund must be its property, since the whole purpose of the requirement is that it may be resorted to in satisfaction of the company's liabilities. The argument loses its force when it is realized that the fund is accumulated as directed by the statute, not in pursuance of a profit making enterprise but in furtherance of a mutual insurance plan carried on by the company in the interests of its members and which may not be applied, except on the order of the Governor in Council, to any purpose other than the settlement of claims or other liabilities. Counsel for the respondent argues that the case at bar is distinguished from the cases relied upon by the appellant by reason of the further provisions of ss. 3. The argument is that any surplus ultimately remaining after payment of all claims will not necessarily be returned to the members. I think it clear, however, from the provisions of the Winding-up Act (R.S.N.B. 1927, c. 97) and of the Insurance Act (S. of N.B. 1937, c. 44), read together, that on a winding-up the surplus, if any remaining after payment of the liabilities, would be returned to the members of the company. In the Jones and the Ayrshire Employers Mutual cases, the fact that only part of the amounts contributed by the members to the reserve fund was in certain circumstances returned to them on their withdrawal was held not to affect the matter and it was decided that the amounts thus accumulated from year to year were neither profits nor gains of the Association. In my opinion, the principle applied in these two cases is applicable to the present case.\nCounsel for the Minister referred to para. (d) of s-s. 1 of s. 6 of the Income War Tax Act which provides that in computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed a deduction shall not be allowed in respect of amounts transferred or credited to a reserve, except such an amount for bad debts as the Minister may allow and except as otherwise provided in the Act. This, however, clearly refers to amounts received which must properly be taken into account in determining whether a profit or loss has resulted from the company's operations and cannot, in my opinion, apply to amounts such as are in question here received by the company for the purpose defined by the Insurance Act.\nWith all the great respect that I hold for any opinion of Mr. Justice Hyndman, my consideration of the present matter leads me to a different conclusion. This appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Exchequer Court.\nTaschereau J.:\u2014For the reasons given by my brother Locke I would allow this appeal with costs here and in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Francis, Woods, Gauley & Blair.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

Mason (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1952: November 11, 12, 13; 1953: April 28.\nPresent: Taschereau, Estey, Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.\nOn Appeal From the Court of Appeal of the Province of Saskatchewan\nNuisance\u2014Negligence\u2014Highway construction near mink farm\u2014Loss of pregnant mink due to noise of construction equipment\u2014Duty to use reasonable care even where nuisance authorized by Statute.\nThe respondent, on learning extensive construction work was about to be undertaken on a provincial highway contiguous to his mink farm, notified responsible officials of the Highway Department that the whelping season had just begun and the noise from such operations would endanger the lives of the female mink and their offspring. In consequence orders were given by the engineer in charge to leave a sufficient gap in the road by carrying on the work at a distance that would prevent disturbance of the mink. Contrary to orders the appellants operated bull dozers and tractors within, the prohibited area and the noise from the equipment resulted in the loss of a number of female mink and their young.\nHeld: 1. (Taschereau and Lockk JJ. dissenting)\u2014That in an action for damages, the plea that the raising of mink, particularly during the whelping season, was a delicate and sensitive business, did not necessarily conclude the matter. A defendant seeking to avoid liability for a nuisance on the basis that he had pursued but the ordinary and normal course of conduct incident to that locality must establish that he acted with reasonable care, even where statutory authority may have authorized the creation of a nuisance. L. & N. W. Ry. Co. v. Bradley 3 Mac. & G. 336 at 341; Geddis v. Proprietors of Bann Reservoir 3 App. Cas. 430; Dufferin Paving & Crushed Stone Ltd. v. Anger [1940] S.C.E. 174 at 177.\n2. That though the respondent's pleadings based the cause of action upon nuisance, it appeared that at the trial the basis of negligence was also considered. It was raised in the Notice of Appeal to the Appeal Court and that Court in its judgment appeared to have founded liability upon negligence. The contention that at this stage respondent's recovery must be restricted to a claim for nuisance, could not be maintained.\n3. That a reasonable man in the position of the appellants would have known of the presence of the respondent's mink, forseen the possibility of damage, and taken reasonable care to avoid it. Failure to do so constituted a breach owing by them to the respondent.\nPer: Taschereau and Locke JJ., dissenting.\u2014The case should be disposed of upon the only issue raised by the pleadings, which was that of nuisance. The appellants were acting as servants of the Crown and no such action lay against them. Had the appellants been acting as servants of the Municipality rather than of the Crown the action likewise should fail: Hammerton v. Dysart [1916] 1 A.C. 57; Gaunt v. Fynney L.R. 8 Ch. 8; Eastern & South African Telegraph Co. v. Cape Town Tramways [1902] A.C. 381; Kine v. Jolly [1905] 1 Ch. 480. As the appellants did not give evidence at the trial as they would presumably have done had the statement of claim contained a count of negligence, the question of their liability on that basis should not be considered.\nAPPEAL by defendants from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan 1 allowing an appeal from the judgment of Taylor J. 2 which dismissed plaintiff's action.\nF. A. Brewin Q.C. and R. Scott for the appellants.\nA. W. Embury for the respondent.\nTaschereau, J.\u2014(dissenting)\u2014For the reasons given by my brother Locke, I would allow the appeal, dismiss the action with costs here and in the court below.\nThe judgment of Estey, Cartwright and Fauteux, J.J. was delivered by:\u2014\nEstey J.:\u2014The respondent (pl.) claims that the appellants (defs.), in operating bulldozers, road graders and other road construction and maintenance equipment upon that portion of Highway No. 35 in the Province of Saskatchewan contiguous to his mink farm, on or about the 9th day of May, 1949, caused the death of valuable mink and their offspring. His action was dismissed at trial, but allowed as against the appellants in the Court of Appeal.\nHighway No. 35 is owned and maintained by Her Majesty The Queen in the right of the Province of Saskatchewan. At all times material hereto the Minister of Highways was reconstructing and repairing the road in front of or contiguous to the respondent's farm and the appellants Neilson and Appenheimer were grade foremen and Grandel, Reine and Ponto operators of caterpillar tractors.\nThe respondent operates a mink farm on the eastern side of Highway No. 35 on lots 1-20, block 59, in the townsite of Qu'Appelle. When, on the 5th day of May, he observed that equipment for reconstruction and repair of the highway was being assembled about 2,000 feet south of his mink farm he realized, because this was the whelping season, the possibility of damage. Immediately he interviewed one who to him appeared to be in charge of the equipment and was advised to go to Regina. This he did, where he interviewed Hartwell, Superintendent of Fur Farms in the Department of Natural Resources. As a consequence, on the morning of May 6, 1949, he received from Hartwell a telegram reading:\nCHIEF ENGINEER WILL CONTACT CONSTRUCTION CREW TO COMMENCE CONSTRUCTION FURTHER UP ROAD IF POSSIBLE\nThe surveyors, at the outset, placed stakes, hereinafter referred to as stations, at each 100 feet, commencing with zero in the centre of Highway No. 1, from which Highway 35 extends northward. The actual work of reconstruction and repair commenced on May 6, at station 20, about 2,000 feet from Highway No. 1. That morning, as a consequence of instructions from his superiors at Regina, Swenson, the engineer in charge, instructed Olson to leave a gap of 1,200 feet between stations 28 and 40 in order \"to prevent disturbing the mink\" and to particularly inform those in charge of the bulldozers and road graders. When this order was given about noon the crew were working near station 24.\nThe respondent's mink pens were about 3,350 to 3,400 feet north of the junction of Highways Nos. 1 and 35. Stations 28 and 40 would be respectively 2,800 and 4,000 feet north of that junction. The evidence justifies a conclusion that the gap of 1,200 feet was fixed at or near stations 28 and 40 and, therefore, the mink pens would be about the centre thereof, or 600 feet from each station. That the equipment was moved from some point south of station 28 northward is clear, but the evidence is conflicting as to where the equipment was working on the morning of the 9th when the damage was suffered. The appellants' evidence is to the effect that the work was commenced north of station 40, while that of the respondent and his witnesses indicates that the work was actually being done at the northwest corner of respondent's property. The learned trial judge found:\n\"I find the fact to be that on the early morning of the 9th, May 1949, the construction work with its accompanying noise, vibration and commotion sufficiently near to the mink, and in entering upon the plaintiff's land to turn the machines, did panic the female mink and caused damage to these female mink and their kittens.\"\nThe learned judges of the Appellate Court accepted this finding and stated:\nThe finding of the learned trial Judge that construction work was actually carried on on the morning of May 9th close to his property and even on the corner of his property is supported by the evidence and should not be disturbed.\nWe have, therefore, concurrent findings of fact as to where the noise was created that caused the damage and such findings ought to be disturbed only in exceptional circumstances which are not here present.\nThe respondent did not object to the noise, except in so far as it caused the death of his mink, nor is it otherwise suggested the noise interfered with the comfort or convenience of the residents of that locality or adversely affected their property. In these circumstances the appellants submit that, though the noise caused the unfortunate loss suffered by the respondent, they are not liable because of the peculiarly delicate and sensitive business of raising mink. That such a business, particularly during the whelping season, may well be styled a delicate and sensitive business is established upon the evidence. The learned trial judge, while dismissing the action upon other grounds, stated:\nWhere, therefore, a fur farm with these female mink at times so susceptible to noise is located on a much travelled highway, the owner must in so locating do so at his own peril, and his industry can claim no special privileges as of right, nor object to the noises incidental to the use, repair, reconstruction and maintenance of the highway by the Highway authorities.\nThe principle underlying the foregoing submission is illustrated by Eastern and South African Telegraph Co. v. Cape Town Tramways 3. The appellant (pl.) maintained a submarine cable into Cape Town where the respondents operated a system of electric tramways. Electricity leaked from the rails and affected the working of the appellant's submarine telegraph cable. In dealing with the common law liability their Lordships of the Judicial Committee pointed out that the apparatus of the telegraph company (appellant) consisted of a delicate instrument at the time the injury complained of was suffered which \"to insure its immunity from disturbance is a somewhat serious liability to cast on neighbours.\"\nTheir Lordships stated at p. 393 :\u2014\nThe true comparison is with things used in the ordinary enjoyment of property, and this instrument differs from such things in its peculiar liability to be affected by even minute currents of electricity \u2026 A man cannot increase the liabilities of his neighbour by applying his own property to special uses, whether for business or pleasure.\nIn Robinson v. Kilvert 4, the landlord occupied the basement and generated heat to the point that it caused damage to the tenant's brown paper stored on the ground floor of the building. It was held that the excessive heat was not something noxious in itself and did not interfere with the ordinary use and enjoyment of the premises. The tenant's application for an injunction was refused. In the course of his judgment Lopes L. J. stated at p. 97:\nA man who carries on an exceptionally delicate trade cannot complain because it is injured by his neighbour doing something lawful on his property, if it is something which would not injure anything but an exceptionally delicate trade.\nThe learned author of Salmond on Torts, 10th Ed., states at p. 226:\nNo action will lie for a nuisance in respect of damage which, even though substantial, is due solely to the fact that the plaintiff is abnormally sensitive to deleterious influences, or uses his land for some purpose which requires exceptional freedom from any such influences \u2026 Extraordinary and special requirements axe not protected by the law of nuisance.\nThat, however, in the circumstances of this case, does not necessarily conclude the matter. The point at which the work was done and the noise caused which disturbed the mink and caused the damage was, under the concurrent findings, at the northwest corner of respondent's property and, therefore, well within the gap and some 300 or 400 feet closer to the mink than had the work been done, according to instructions, north of the gap. The grade foremen Neilson and Appenheimer and the operators of the machines were not only acting contrary to instructions given to avoid damage to the mink, but were in a place where, as hereinafter described, reasonable men would have foreseen damage would probably result and taken those precautions which, under the circumstances were possible to avoid it. It was their failure to take this reasonable care that created the noise from which the damage resulted.\nA defendant who seeks to avoid liability for a nuisance on the basis that he has pursued but the ordinary and normal course of conduct incident to that locality must establish that he acted with reasonable care.\nThose who say that their interference with the comfort of their neighbours is justified because their operations are normal and usual and conducted with proper care and skill are under a specific duty, if they wish to make good that defence, to use that reasonable and proper care and skill. (Sir Wilfrid Greene M.R. in Andreae v. Selfridge & Co. 5)\nEven where statutory authority may authorize the creation of a nuisance, parties must, in order to obtain that immunity, act with reasonable care.\nBut in order to secure this immunity the powers conferred by the Legislature must be exercised without negligence, or, as it is perhaps better expressed, with judgment and caution (per Lord Truro, L. & N.W.R. Co. v. Bradley.6) For damage which could not have been avoided by any reasonably practicable care on the part of those who are authorised to exercise the power, there is no right of action. But they must not do needless harm; and if they do, it is a wrong against which the ordinary remedies are available. Pollock on Torts, 15th Ed., p. 94. \u2026 it is now thoroughly well established that no action will lie for doing that which the legislature has authorized, if it be done without negligence, although it does occasion damage to anyone; but an action does lie for doing that which the legislature has authorized, if it be done negligently. And I think that if by a reasonable exercise of the powers, either given by statute to the promoters, or which they have at common law, the damage could be prevented it is, within this rule, 'negligence' not to make such reasonable exercise of this powers. Geddis v. Proprietors of Bann Reservoir. 7\nIn Groat v. City of Edmonton 8, the plaintiffs, riparian owners, recovered damages against the City of Edmonton for pollution of a stream. Duff J. (later C.J.) stated at p. 526;\nThe existence of a state of affairs constituting a nuisance in fact, is found, and is, I think, established as resulting from the construction and use of the large sewer extending through the northeast arm; and this was in law a nuisance chargeable to the municipality, unless sufficient justification or excuse has also been established. Rinfret J. (later C.J.) with whom Anglin C.J.C. concurred, stated at p. 534:\nThe city therefore has inflicted and still inflicts unnecessary injury upon the appellant.\nIn Dufferin Paving & Crushed Stone Ltd. v. Anger, 9 Davis J., with whom Duff C.J. and Hudson J. concurred, stated :\nIt may with advantage, however, be pointed out that the authority to use the street was not obligatory but only permissive, and that even where there is a statutory obligation upon a person, that does not entitle him to invade the rights of others unless he can show that in practical feasibility the obligation could be performed in no way save one which involves damage to other persons.\nIt would seem in principle that a similar rule should apply where, as here, the appellants seek to avoid liability on the basis that, though they created the noise which caused the damage, recovery should be denied because of the delicate and sensitive nature of respondent's business\u2014 a business well known throughout the Province. In fact, respondent operated his mink farm under a licence issued by the Provincial Government.\nIn Andreae v. Selfridge & Co., (supra), Selfridge & Co. appealed from a judgment at trial holding that it had created a nuisance in demolishing and constructing certain buildings. In the Court of Appeal, Sir Wilfrid Greene M.R., with whom Romer L.J. and Scott L.J. agreed, stated at p. 6:\nI am unable to take the view that any of these operations was of such an abnormal character as to justify treating the disturbance created by it, and the whole of the disturbance created by it, as constituting a nuisance. That applies to both the first and the second operations.\nThe Master of the Rolls, however, went on to hold that Selfridge & Co. was liable for noise caused at unreasonable hours in respect of the first operation and then, as to the second, that it had not satisfied the burden upon it to establish that all reasonable and proper precautions had been taken to reduce the quantity of dust and grit which he described as \"insufferable.\" Lord Green stated at p. 10:\nThe use of reasonable care and skill in connection with matters of this kind may take various forms. It may take the form of restricting the hours during which the work is to be done; it may take the form of limiting the amount of a particular type of work which is being done simultaneously within a particular area; it may take the form of using proper scientific means of avoiding inconvenience. Whatever form it takes, it has to be done, and those who do not do it must not be surprised if they have to pay the penalty for disregarding their neighbours' rights.\nThe officials in the Department of Highways, apprized of the possible damage that might result, did what reasonable men, foreseeing the possibility of damage, would have done and instructed the engineer in charge \"to commence construction further up road if possible.\" That such was possible is established by the fact that a gap of 1,200 feet was directed and if proper care had been exercised the equipment would have been moved to the north of that and, as the respondent states, if work had been done a similar distance from his mink pens on the north as on the south damage would not have resulted.\nIt would, therefore, appear that the appellants were negligent in creating the noise within the gap and in such proximity to the mink and, therefore, cannot avail themselves of the defence based upon the delicate and sensitive nature of respondent's business of raising mink.\nMoreover, quite apart from any question of nuisance, it would appear that the appellants are liable on the basis of their own negligence. The maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas is applicable to both nuisance and negligence. Broom's Legal Maxims, 10th Ed., 238, 248, 252. Though the respondent, in his pleadings, bases his cause of action upon nuisance, it would rather appear that it has also been treated on the basis of negligence. The learned trial judge so considered it. It was raised in the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal and the learned Chief Justice, writing on behalf of the learned judges of that Court, would appear to have founded liability upon the negligent conduct of the appellants. The contention of counsel for the appellants that at this stage the respondent's recovery must be restricted to a claim for nuisance cannot be maintained.\nThe respondent's mink pens were within approximately 250 feet of the northwest corner of his property. These, as well as two signs reading \"Mink, no trespassing,\" were within the view of persons using or working upon the highway. The respondent had spoken to someone at the equipment on Thursday, the 5th. The instructions relative to the gap and the moving northward were received and communicated on the 6th. Swenson, the engineer in charge, deposed that when he told Olson, in the presence of Thomson and Boivin, to leave a gap of 1,200 feet, one of them inquired why and he explained \"to prevent disturbing the mink\" and went on to tell Olson to give the instructions \"To whoever was in charge of the machines at the time.\" Olson corroborates this and states: \"Well, my instructions were to tell the construction crew not to build past station 28, that there would be a gap left of twelve hundred feet.\" It was, as Olson explained, not \"an ordinary order, it was something different.\" Barker and Hanson both admitted they knew of the presence of the mink and the reason for the gap. Neilson deposes that he did not know of the mink farm and, in fact, was not told why the gap of 1,200 feet was made. On the other hand a witness whom the learned trial judge evidently believed deposed that Neilson had told him they \"had to move on account of the mink farm.\" The damage was not suffered until Monday, May 9. In the interval between the 5th and the 9th, as the learned Chief Justice, speaking on behalf of the Court of Appeal, observed, \"There is much evidence to the effect that it was common knowledge that the gap was left to protect the plaintiff's mink.\"\nA reasonable man in the position of the grade foremen and the operators of these large machines would have known of the presence of the respondent's mink, foreseen the possibility of damage and taken reasonable care to avoid it. Their failure to do so constituted a breach of duty owing by them to the respondent.\nIn considering whether a person owes to another a duty a breach of which will render him liable to that other in damages for negligence, it is material to consider what the defendant ought to have contemplated as a reasonable man. This consideration may play a double r\u00f4le. It is relevant in cases of admitted negligence (where the duty and breach are admitted) to the question of remoteness of damage, i.e., to the question of compensation not to culpability, but it is also relevant in testing the existence of a duty as the foundation of the alleged negligence, i.e., to the question of culpability not to compensation. Lord Russell of Killowen in Hay or Bourhill v. Young. 10\nThere is here present evidence of markings and conversations which, in the exercise of reasonable care, would have brought home to the appellants the presence of the mink and the damage that might result from the noise. Those factors essential to liability absent in Nova Mink Ltd. v. T.C.A., 11, are here present.\nIn MacGibbon v. Robinson, 12, the plaintiff operated a mink farm. The trial judge found that the defendant, with knowledge both that this was the whelping season and that during that season noise and disturbance might cause damage, discharged two blasting shots upon land which he was clearing and which did, in fact, cause serious damage to the plaintiff's mink. It was also held that the defendant had been advised by certain government employees that they had discontinued land clearing operations until after the whelping season. It was also found that these shots were unnecessary. In these circumstances the defendant was held liable for the damage caused.\nCounsel for the appellant submits that the evidence does not specify which of the defendants caused the damage and, therefore, the action should be dismissed. Neilson and Appenheimer were grade foremen who, upon the morning in question, were directing the operators of the machines. The learned trial judge found the damage was done in the early morning of the 9th. Appenheimer deposed \"We both directed where it was necessary\" and to a suggestion that they might at times become separated over a space of 1,000 feet and, referring particularly to the morning in question, he said \"Well, we would be very close together, just starting up.\" It was stressed that one witness deposed but two machines were operating at the point in question. Another witness, however, deposed that he saw four or six. In view of this conflict it is significant that neither Neilson nor Appenheimer, the grade foremen, suggests that the usual number were not operating.\nThese men were all employed in the construction and repair of this highway and, upon the morning in question, in the course of their work created the noise. The learned judges in the Court of Appeal have found them to be joint tortfeasors and they may be, particularly if the provisions of s. 3 of the Contributory Negligence Act (S. of Sask. 1944, c. 23) are applicable. On the other hand, they may be \"several concurrent tortfeasors,\" as that phrase is used in Williams\u2014Joint Tortfeasors and Contributory Negligence, p. 5 et seq. The point is often one difficult to determine and here, as the case was presented, it is unnecessary to determine under which heading these men must be placed. Sewell v. B.C. Towing & Transportation Co. Ltd., 13 Sault Ste. Marie Pulp and Paper Co. v. Myers, 14; Till v. Town of Oakville 15, (reversed on other grounds, 33 O.L.R. 120).\nJudgment was not directed against Barker and Hanson in the Court of Appeal and they are not before this Court. The learned trial judge did not accept the evidence of those who deposed that the work was done north of the gap and it, therefore, follows that the work on the morning in question was done within the gap and at a point near the northeast quarter of the respondent's property. The appellants before this Court all participated in that work and in the creation of the noise.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nLocke J. (dissenting) :\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan 16 which allowed the appeal of the present appellant from a judgment of Taylor J. 17 by which the action was dismissed. In view of the nature of the claim advanced in the pleadings and the manner in which the action has been dealt with in the judgment appealed from, it is necessary to examine closely the evidence adduced at the trial.\nThe respondent, in the spring of 1949, established what is described as a fur farm on the outskirts of the Town of Qu'Appelle and there carried on the occupation of raising mink. Prior to this time, he had engaged in operations of this nature on a farm near Grenfell, Sask. At Qu'Appelle he acquired a property described as Block 59, comprising an area 500 feet in length and 300 feet in width, the western boundary of which fronted upon Provincial Highway No. 35. On this property, he constructed pens and other buildings required for carrying on his operations. To this site he brought some 49 female mink and 12 males which were maintained there within an enclosure. According to a rough sketch of the premises put in by the respondent at the trial, the nearest of these pens was distant approximately 250 feet from the easterly limit of the highway which ran due north and south.\nIt was established in evidence that at the time female mink are about to whelp, and for some two weeks thereafter, they are extremely sensitive to unusual noises and, when disturbed by such a cause, are liable to kill their young and frequently themselves suffer death. The time of the year when this condition is present is apparently during the last days of April and the early days of May.\nHighway No. 35 is a provincial highway, a term defined by s-s. 2 of s. 8 of The Highways and Transportation Act, 1949, as being a public highway designated as such by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. Public highway is defined by s-s. 9 of s. 2 of the Act as meaning a road allowance or a road, street or lane vested in His Majesty or set aside for such purpose under the provisions of The Northwest Territories Act or any Act of Saskatchewan and includes any bridge, culvert, drain or other public improvement erected upon or in connection with such public highway. It was admitted on behalf of the defendants for the purpose of the trial that Highway No. 35 was a provincial highway and:\u2014 \"as such is the responsibility of the Government of Saskatchewan for maintenance and repairs.\" It was further admitted that the appellants were between the 5th and the 10th days of May, 1949, engaged as members of a work crew doing maintenance and repair work on the said highway in the area adjoining, but not contiguous to, the lands of the respondent.\nOn May 5, 1949, the respondent saw the work crew, of which the appellants were members, on Highway 35 to the south of his property. They had with them a caterpillar tractor for use in connection with the work and, believing that the noise made by such machines on the road maintenance work might cause damage to the mink, he spoke to a member of the crew and told him about the danger. He could not identify the person to whom he had spoken. He then went and spoke to some other unidentified persons who referred him to the Department of Highways at Regina. He, thereupon, went to Regina and spoke to a Mr. Hartwell, who was the Supervisor of Game in the Department of Natural Resources. It was admitted on behalf of the appellants that Hartwell brought to the notice of the Department of Highways that Mason was concerned about the effect of the highway operations on the mink, and on May 6th Hartwell wired the respondent from Regina, saying that the Chief Engineer would instruct the crew to commence construction further up the road, if possible.\nOn May 6th, the crew commenced operations on the highway to the south of the respondent's property. According to Orville Swenson, a graduate engineer employed by the Department of Highways, he was the resident engineer in charge of the work to be performed upon Highway No. 35 and directed the work of the survey gang who were establishing the lines for the proposed work and driving stakes for the guidance of those who were to do the work, which involved widening the right-of-way by some 17 feet, starting at a point a mile north of Qu'Appelle. Stations were established at every 100 feet and stakes driven. Gordon Olson was the construction foreman in charge of the work. On the morning of May 6th, a construction engineer of the Department gave instructions that no work was to be carried on upon the highway for a distance of 1,000 feet opposite the respondent's property, the centre of the gap to be in line with the mink pens. Swenson instructed Olson as to this, who, in turn, communicated the order to the appellant Neilson, who was sub-foreman on the work. E. W. Boivin was the foreman in charge of the construction work and, working under him, in addition to Neilson, was the appellant Appenheimer. Boivin received the same instructions as to the gap to be left opposite the respondent's place directly from Swenson.\nOn May 7th, the crew carried on the work of construction to the south of the respondent's property and it appears to be common ground that no ill result followed from their operations on that day. May 8th was a Sunday and no work was done but operations were continued on Monday, May 9th, and it was upon this date that the damage was caused. There is a conflict between the evidence of the respondent and of two witnesses called by him and of the witnesses for the appellant, as to the exact area in which work was done on that day. According to the respondent, the crew discontinued work on the 7th, 600 feet south of the southern limit of his property and, having removed their equipment, they recommenced their operations on the road allowance at the northwest corner of his land \"right up from my mink pens\", on Monday. On the same day the respondent says that the crew excavated a small portion of a borrow pit which was thereafter greatly extended so that, according to the respondent, it was ultimately some 210 feet in length and encroached approximately 25 feet along the western boundary of his property. That part excavated, however, on May 9th was only a small portion at the northwest corner of his property. The respondent, however, contends that in digging this part of the pit on May 9th the crew trespassed upon his property. According to Donald Leslie, a labourer who was a member of the crew and who was called by the respondent, there were two 'machines engaged in moving earth opposite the northwest corner of the property in question. He said that the tracks of the caterpillar tractors and the buckets and the cables which moved them made a lot of noise. The respondent did not attempt to describe the noise made by the operation of the machinery but it resulted, he said, in the mink becoming very excited, apparently through fright. In addition to saying that a small portion of the borrow pit was excavated on his land on May 9th, he said that during part of the time the operators of the machinery turned it around on his property, but the evidence as to this is extremely vague. The necessity for doing so when the highway was available for this purpose does not appear. After working at the location mentioned for a period which the respondent described as \"a matter of a few hours\", they moved to the north, away from his property.\nA further witness called by the respondent, Alex Haughian, who was engaged by the Department of Highways for cutting brush on the road allowance, said that Neilson had told him on May 7th that the work they were doing was causing trouble with the respondent's mink and that they were to work to the north. It will be noted, however, that the respondent himself said that there was no trouble with the animals at that time. On May 9th, Haughian said that he was working near the northwest corner of the respondent's property and that the machines moving the earth were working to the south of him and that there were from 4 to 6 of them and that Neilson was directing the work.\nAs opposed to this evidence, Boivin, the foreman who said that there were 5 caterpillar tractors in operation on the work between the 5th and the 10th of May and that two of the operators were the appellants Grandel and Reine, said that a gap of over 1,200 feet had been left, on instructions, opposite the respondent's land and that no work was done along this part of the road, or on the borrow pit, between the 7th and the 19th of May and that no work was done at any time within 600 feet of the mink pens. Olson said that the centre of the gap was very close to opposite the mink pens. Swenson, the resident engineer, was at the scene on the morning of May 9th and said that the crew were then working about 400 feet to the north of the north end of the gap and that no work was done in the gap up to the time he left the work on May 19th. L. O. Thompson, the resident engineer employed by the Government at Qu'Appelle, said that no work was done in the gap between the 6th and the 19th of May and that the borrow pit was not commenced until May 19th. Barker and Hanson, both of whom were named as defendants in the action and were engaged in operating tractors on the work on the day in question, say that no work was done in the gap on that day, the operations being carried on to the north of it. The appellant Appenheimer said that he had not ordered any of the machines to operate in the gap after May 6th and that none of the drivers had done any work on that section of road between May 6th and 19th.\nTaylor J. by whom the case was tried, after saying that this was a Government project and that there was no evidence that any of the defendants did anything other than in pursuance of the orders given to them, which they were employed and paid to perform, said:\u2014\nIt may be, and I strongly suspect, there was negligence in the supervision of the work and carrying it out by the head foreman and the resident engineer, but they are not parties to the action. I find the fact to foe that on the early morning of May 9, 1949, the construction work with its accompanying noise, vibration and commotion sufficiently near to the mink, and in entering upon the plaintiff's land to turn the machines, did panic the female mink and caused damage to these female mink and their kittens.\nand further, after saying that, in his opinion, none of the defendants were liable, the learned Judge said:\u2014\nAs stated, I am satisfied that an error was made in proceeding with the project at the place in question on the 9th May. The resident engineer and head foreman had gone off the job over the weekend, and instructions to pass that place and work elsewhere may have been given to the engineer and were disregarded.\nThis, I think, must be taken as a finding of fact that work was carried on by the construction crew at or near the northwest corner of the respondent's property and that some of the machines had entered on the property to turn around. The action was framed in nuisance but the learned trial judge appeared to be of the opinion that it might properly be treated as including a claim for damages for negligence and as the defendant workmen owed no duty to the plaintiff, whether statutory or otherwise, in his opinion, he considered the action failed. For this reason, he found it unnecessary to examine the evidence to ascertain which, if any, of the defendants were actually engaged in the particular work that caused the damage. Taylor J. further considered that the operator of a fur farm locating close to a much travelled highway must be deemed to have done so at his own peril and to be without any right to object to the consequences of noises incidental to the use, repair, reconstruction and maintenance of the highway. This, I think, was directed to the claim for nuisance.\nThe present respondent's appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed, the unanimous judgment of the Court being given by the Chief Justice of Saskatchewan. In the reasons for his judgment the learned Chief Justice said in part:\u2014\nThe finding of the learned trial Judge that construction work was actually carried on on the morning of May 9 close to his property and even on the corner of his property is supported by the evidence and should not be disturbed.\nWithout mentioning the fact that the action was framed in nuisance, he said further that a public employee must be subject to the common law relating to negligence, to the same extent as any other individual, and is personally responsible if he fails to take that reasonable care to avoid injury to anyone to whom he owes a duty in the circumstances and, after commenting on the fact that while the appellants Grandel, Reine and Ponto had filed defences but had not given evidence at the trial (a fact which is considered to be significant), expressed the view that the evidence warranted a conclusion that a prima facie case was made against these three operators of the machinery, there being evidence that the workmen of the crew knew of the mink and knew that the gap was being left to protect them, and accordingly:\u2014\nowed a duty to the plaintiff to take care not to operate within the limits of the gap\u2014there was a forseeable risk\u2014and in my opinion they are liable for the damages caused by carrying on the operations within the gap and so close to the plaintiff's premises and the mink pens.\nHe was further of the opinion that the appellants Neilson and Appenheimer, together with the three machine operators, were joint tortfeasors, and jointly and severally liable for the entire damage suffered by the plaintiff.\nI am unable to construe the allegations made by the Statement of Claim in this action, other than as a claim for damages for nuisance. The pleading contains no allegations of negligence. Had this been the cause of action, particulars of the negligence relied upon must have been pleaded or furnished on the defendant's demand. Such particulars would presumably have differed in respect of the claim against the defendants such as Neilson and Appenheimer who, as sub-foremen, were in a position of authority on the work and Grandel, Reine and Ponto, who merely operated the road building equipment, under their direction. I am, with respect, unable to attach importance to the fact that Grandel, Reine and Ponto did not give evidence at the trial. The only claim pleaded against them was that, as operators of the machinery, they were parties to the commission of a nuisance. The nuisance, if such there was, was committed on the instructions and on behalf of the Crown. It was presumably by reason of the plaintiff being advised that an action for damages for nuisance would not lie against the Crown in the right of the Province that the plaintiff decided to proceed against the servants of the Crown, rather than initiating proceedings by a Petition of Right under the provisions of c. 73, R.S.S. 1940. If these three defendants were advised (as I would assume they were) that a claim founded in nuisance did not, in these circumstances, lie against them, their failure to give evidence at the trial appears to me to be without significance.\nThe nature of the acts alleged to constitute a nuisance was causing \"offensive and pestilential noises to be created on and about the plaintiff's lands and premises.\" If it be assumed, for the purpose of argument, that an action for damages for nuisance would lie against the Crown in respect of road making operations carried on by it upon Crown property in the manner in which such operations are customarily conducted, as it might against a municipal corporation, the question to be determined at the outset is whether the respondent has any such right of action in the circumstances disclosed by the evidence. Assuming this and since the claim is in nuisance, any right of the respondent against the servants of the Crown cannot be any higher than they would be against their employer if it was liable to an action for such a tort.\nMuch evidence was adduced on behalf of the respondent as to the particular sensitivity of female mink to disturbance from unusual noise or other causes shortly before whelping and for some two weeks thereafter. According to the respondent, the mink were not, even at this period, affected by the ordinary noise of traffic and the other noises to which they are accustomed. Thus, he said, they were not affected by the noise from the operation of his own farm machinery. A. K. McNeill, who had had some nine years' experience with raising mink in Saskatchewan, said that, from approximately the 1st of May until the 1st of June, noise caused by an aeroplane and even strange human voices would disturb them and might cause damage. Noise from highway traffic to which they have become accustomed was not, in his experience, likely to cause any disturbance. Walter Lefurgey, an experienced mink rancher and the President of the Saskatchewan Provincial Fur Breeders' Association called by the plaintiff, said that the mink at such time did not appear to mind noises they were used to but, if there was any very great noise, they were liable to kill their young. He considered the month of May to be the danger period.\nThere is no suggestion in the present matter that such noise as was caused by the road making machinery at the time in question was more than that usually attendant upon like operations, or that it would have caused any inconvenience or discomfort to the owners or occupants of the adjoining property other than the respondent. The respondent's case, therefore, is that by carrying on his operations in a location, chosen by himself, closely adjoining a public highway, he has imposed upon the owners or occupants of adjoining property a liability that would otherwise not exist.\nThe differences between cases of nuisance and cases of negligence must never be lost sight of (Latham v. Johnson,18). Negligence is not necessarily an element of nuisance. The principle underlying the action for damages for nuisance is the same as the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas. As pointed out by Lord Parker in Hammerton v. Dysart, 19, nuisance involves damage but damage alone is not sufficient to give rise to a right of action. There must be some right in the person damaged to immunity from the damage complained of. The nature and extent of that right is the matter to be determined.\nIn Gaunt v. Fynney 20, where the action was to restrain a nuisance, by noise, Lord Seiborne L.C. said that a nuisance by noise was emphatically a question of degree and that (p. 12):\u2014\nIf my neighbour builds a house against a party-wall, next to my own, and I hear through the wall more than is agreeable to me of the sounds from 'his nursery or his music-room, it does not follow (even if I am nervously sensitive or in infirm health) that I can bring an action or obtain an injunction. Such things, to offend against the law, must be done in a manner which, beyond fair controversy, ought to be regarded as exceptive and unreasonable.\nIn Cook v. Forbes 21, a manufacturer of fabrics which were sensitive to injury by sulphuretted hydrogen claimed damages for nuisance against the defendant, a manufacturer whose operations resulted in large quantities of that\ngas being discharged into the air. Page-Wood V.C. held that it was not an answer to the claim that the product manufactured was of great delicacy and thus liable to injury from a substance which would not otherwise cause damage. In that case, however, as pointed out by Lindley L.J. in Robinson v. Kilvert 22, the gas poured into the air from the defendant's works was in itself of an offensive and noxious character, and this was to be distinguished from doing something not in itself noxious which makes the neighbouring property no worse for any of the ordinary purposes of trade.\nIn Eastern and South African Telegraph Company v. Cape Town Tramways 23, dealing with the liability of the Tramway Company for damages caused to the submarine cable of the appellants by the escape of electricity stored by the respondents for the due working of their tramway system, Lord Robertson said in part (p. 393) :\u2014\nNow, having regard to the assumptions of the appellant's argument, it seems necessary to point out that the appellants, as licensees to lay their cable in the sea and as owners of the premises in Cape Town where the signals are received, cannot claim higher privileges than other owners of land, and cannot create for themselves, by reason of the peculiarity of their trade apparatus, a higher right to limit the operations of their neighbours than belongs to ordinary owners of land who do not trade with telegraphic cables. If the apparatus of such concerns requires special protection against the operation of their neighbours, that must be found in legislation ; the remedy at present invoked is' an appeal to a common law principle which applies to much more usual and less special conditions. A man cannot increase the liabilities of his neighbour by applying his own property to special uses, whether for business or pleasure.\nIn Kine v. Jolly 24, Vaughan Williams L.J. said in part (p. 489) :\u2014\nI think we must bear in mind that in these cases, which are conveniently grouped together as cases in which the proper form of action is an action of nuisance, citizens are not to be allowed to enforce rights which limit the user by others of property, unless the facts relied upon as constituting a nuisance are such as interfere with the ordinary rights which according to the ordinary notions of mankind they are entitled to exercise in relation to one another and in relation to their property. The authorities upon this aspect of the law of nuisance appear to me to be accurately summarized in Pearce and Meston on the Law of Nuisance at pages 39, 50 and 51. In my opinion, a person establishing an industry of any nature upon a public highway such as the Provincial Highway in question here, or upon highways the ownership of which is vested in municipalities, upon which, of necessity, maintenance and construction work must be done from time to time in the ordinary course of events, has no right in law to complain of the noise attendant upon the performance of such work on the ground that it is a nuisance and, accordingly, the claim advanced in the present matter must fail.\nI do not interpret the Statement of Claim as advancing a claim in trespass. If there was, indeed, some entry upon the respondent's property near the northwest corner, this appears to have been justified under the provisions of s-s. (d) of s. 30 of the Highways and Transportation Act, 1949. The evidence as to any entry upon the respondent's land for the purpose of turning around is very slight and there is nothing to suggest that any damage flowed from this, as distinct from that resulting from the noise of the operations upon the right-of-way.\nThere is no suggestion in the evidence that the road making machinery was operated in a negligent manner so that it made more noise than that which ordinarily resulted from its operation. The negligence suggested is that of having operated in that area at the time in question, contrary to their instructions. In these circumstances, and as I think it to be the case that the activities carried on at the time in question were not an infringement by the Crown (and would not have been an infringement on the part of a Municipality) of any right of the respondent, I have difficulty in understanding upon what footing the servants of the Crown might be held liable for performing or directing the performance of the work. I am satisfied that if the plaintiff's claim had been framed in negligence further evidence would have been tendered on behalf of the appellants. As no such case was made against them, I decline to speculate as to the particulars of the negligence which might have been asserted against the appellants, or the nature of the defence which would have been raised by them against such a claim, or the evidence that would have been given to support it. I think this case should be disposed of upon the issues raised in the pleadings.\nI would allow this appeal with costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.

They have become the de facto international or (maritime rules on the high seas, and the duties raised on the two vessels were therefore rules of law proceeding from a recognized paramount source.\nPer Kerwin and Estey JJ.: The International Rules of the Road, as established by Canadian Order in Council P.C. 259, dated February 9, 1897, and those contained in the King's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions (as amended to November 1943) and incorporated in the Naval Service Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 139, were the governing rules to be applied under ss. 19(c) and 50A of the Exchequer Court Act in the present case.\nPer Locke J.: The International Rules of the Road, not being by their terms made applicable to the Crown, did not apply. The fact, however that that portion of the rules governing the conduct of vessels proceeding on crossing courses had been almost universally adopted by ships of seafaring nations and that an identical rule forms part of the King's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions affords evidence from which the inference may properly be drawn that failing to comply with it is negligent conduct. In addition there was evidence justifying the finding that there had been no proper lookout kept on the naval vessel.\nPer Locke J. (dissenting in part) : The Crown is not entitled to limit the amount of its liability under s. 649 of the Canada Shipping Act of 1934, since such limitation of the liability of His Majesty qua owner is excluded by s. 712 of that Act. Furthermore, the principle that the Crown may invoke the benefit of any statute, though not named in it, has no application where as here the matter has been dealt with by Parliament.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Thorson P. 1, holding, in an action brought under s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act, that the respondent was entitled to recover the full amount of its damages from the appellant for the total loss of its vessel, the S.S. Blairnevis, when she collided on February 13, 1945, with the Canadian frigate, H.M.C.S. Orkney, in the Irish Sea.\nF. P. Varcoe Q.C. and A. J. MacLeod for the appellant.\nC. R. McKenzie Q.C. and L. A. Sherwood for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Rand J. was delivered by:\u2014\nRand J. :\u2014This litigation arises out of a collision between H.M.C.S. Orkney and the ship Blairnevis on the morning of February 13, 1945 in the Irish Sea, a few miles north of The Skerries. Besides that of negligence in the navigation of the Orkney, questions were raised at trial of the applica- tion of s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act, which gives a right of action against the Crown for negligence, to acts causing damage on the high seas; of the governing law and whether it could be said to be effective in the special circumstances of the collision; and whether the Crown was entitled to invoke s. 649 of the Canada Shipping Act in limitation of damages.\nOn the argument before this Court, Mr. Varcoe stated that, for the purposes of the appeal, he would not contest the application of s. 19(c), and we are not then concerned with that issue.\nOn the second point, the controlling fact is that the Crown, not liable for the tortious acts of its servant, has by statute accepted liability. The legislation by which that has been done must be taken as impliedly envisaging the law according to which the liability of both the servant and master, in any case, arises. The courts in applying s. 19(c) have uniformly held that within Canada that law is the law of the province in which the act takes place, and as of the time of the enactment of the statute; but as to acts on the high seas, the situation is somewhat complicated.\nIn 1943 by c. 25 of the Dominion Statutes, enacting s. 50A of the Exchequer Court Act, the members of the naval, military or air services of His Majesty were declared as from June 24, 1938 to be deemed servants of the Crown for the purposes of s. 19(c). To what law, then, applicable to a collision on the high seas between a Canadian naval vessel and a merchant ship registered in Scotland must we relate the accepted liability, the law creating liability of the persons actually to blame for it and vicariously of the Crown, as an employer, for whom they were acting. If Parliament itself has legislated in relation to either or both of these matters, that would seem to me necessarily to be the law to which that liability must be related.\nUnder the Imperial Shipping Act of 1894, regulations governing navigation were in 1910 promulgated by Order in Council. The Act by s. 424 provided that with the consent of foreign countries the regulations could, by Order in Council, be extended to apply to their ships when either within or beyond British jurisdiction as if they were British ships; and by the same order they were so applied, with unimportant exceptions, to all maritime European countries, to most of the countries of North and South America, including the United States, and to a number in Asia.\nThese regulations affected only merchant vessels but in the same year the Admiralty issued Instructions identical with them to govern the ships of the navy. By the Naval Service Act, (1910) c. 139, R.S.C. 1927, these Instructions, so far as applicable, were adopted for the Canadian naval service, and they were in effect at the time of the collision. It was found by the President 2, and not challenged before us, that the particular rules governing the situation here were the same as those prescribed by the Imperial orders.\nThe sources of law imposing the regulation on the merchant vessel and on the naval ship here are seen to be different: but the rules, first codified in 1863 under the Merchants' Shipping Amendment Act of that year and assented to by the maritime nations, originating in the uniform practices of navigators for centuries, have since their enactment been universally followed. They have become the de facto international or maritime rules on the high seas, and it would be to disregard realities to deal with the duties raised on the two vessels otherwise than as rules of law proceeding from a recognized paramount source: The Scotia 3.\nTheir adoption by the statute for the governance of Canadian naval vessels is in fact the recognition of their international character. It was the statutory enactment by Congress in 1864 of identical rules, that was treated by the British government as the \"consent\" of the United States under the Act of 1863. The principle that the maritime or international law applicable in any country is that interpretation of it given by that country can here be accorded its full effect, and its result is simply the submission of the naval forces to that broader but identical law. The observance of the rules by Canadian vessels, not only towards other ships of Canadian registry but towards all vessels bound by them, as the law of the sea, is inherent in the language of the statute. Within the western seas, certainly, they create the duties on the part of those in charge of Canadian naval ships out of which their liability for negligence must arise: Vaughan-Williams L.J. in H.M.S. Sans Pareil 4.\nThe scope of that liability at common and maritime law has been modified by statute. The Canada Shipping Act in ss. 640 et seq., deals with negligence on the part of two or more vessels in collision and attributes responsibility according to the degree of fault. These provisions constitute likewise part of the general law of negligence applicable to the liability of the servant, on which, in turn, the Crown's liability is founded.\nThe same principle attracts finally those provisions of Dominion law which deal directly with the imputed responsibility of owners. By ss. 649 to 655 inclusive, provision is made for the limitation of the damages issuing from that liability. It was argued that, because of s. 712, these sections had no application to the Crown. By force of the statute alone, that is so, but being part of the general law from which the liability of a master arises, they are within the contemplation of s. 19(c). What is sought is the law governing the collision: Parliament has enacted its own laws of negligence; and the liability, in all its aspects, of the owner in the case of private persons, for the negligence of servants, so arising, is that adopted by 19(c).\nThe President of the Exchequer Court 5, after a careful examination of the facts, found the Orkney solely to blame for the collision and rejected the contention that the Blairnevis had aggravated the damages by unreasonable delay in seeking assistance. On the argument I was satisfied that the President's findings had not been successfully challenged, and further consideration has confirmed that view.\nThe substantial point against the applicability of the law was as follows. The Orkney at the time was, under Admiralty orders, moving southeasterly to take up escort duty into Liverpool of a portion of a convoy that was to divide near The Skerries, off Anglesey, the other portion proceeding north to Glasgow; the Blairnevis had in the meantime detached herself from the convoy and was proceeding northerly to Workington; in February, 1945, the allies were still at war with Germany and its associates; we must assume, as the facts indicate, that the hazards from submarine and air bombing were at all times, in the Irish Sea, to be anticipated; and that in this situation the civil law of negligence is not to be taken as operative.\nThree authorities bear upon this proposition. There is, first, the case of H.M.S. Hydra 6 in which a steamship was damaged by a collision with a destroyer. The action was heard in camera and we do not know all the facts ; but as the collision took place in the English Channel in February, 1917, the destroyer was undoubtedly engaged in at least equal warlike activities and in an area that was surcharged with war dangers. In the judgment as reported no reference is made to the supersession of the law of negligence, the controversy was decided solely upon the ordinary rules of seamanship, and the destroyer held alone to blame. In H.M.S. Drake 7, a naval vessel having been torpedoed and heading southeasterly from Rathlin Island in a damaged condition collided with a steamship. This took place in October, 1917 in Rathlin Sound, and again it is necessary to assume that the same warlike operations and war perils were present as in the previous case; but the judgments of Roche J. and of the Court of Appeal deal with the case only in relation to the rules of good seamanship. The action was, in fact, dismissed but there is no hint of any suspension of the ordinary law.\nThe last examination of the question arose in the High Court of Australia. In Shaw Savill & Albion Company Limited v. The Commonwealth 8, the action was brought against the Crown for negligence by a naval vessel. A special defence was pleaded to the effect that the naval vessel was proceeding on its course pursuant to Admiralty instructions during a state of war, and that at the time of the collision it was engaged in active naval operations against the enemy. In reply, the plaintiff both denied the facts and pleaded a demurrer; and it was on the latter that the case went to appeal. The court, consisting of Rich, A.C.J., Starke J., Dixon J. (now C.J.), McTiernan J. and Williams J. agreed in the general proposition that in the circumstances of actual hostile engagement the civil laws are in effect supplanted and no act of persons participating in it can give rise to liability in negligence. On the other hand it was agreed that not all warlike activity can be said to be active operations against the enemy; that, as the two authorities already mentioned show, there may be activity which, though warlike, is nevertheless accompanied by the duty of care towards civilian interests, to be judged, as in all other cases, in the light of the existing conditions. No theory by which the point at which the liability ceases is attempted. The substance of the opinions is stated in these words of Dixon J.:\u2014\nA real distinction does exist between actual operations against the enemy and other activities of the combatant services in time of war. For instance, a warship proceeding to her anchorage or manoeuvring among other ships in a harbour, or acting as a patrol or even as a convoy must be navigated with due regard to the safety of other shipping and no reason is apparent for treating her officers as under no civil duty of care, remembering always that the standard of care is that which is reasonable in the circumstances \u2026 It may not be easy under conditions of modern warfare to say in a given case upon which side of the line it falls.\nThe court agreed that the question of the existence of the state of things excluding liability was one for the civil tribunals.\nThe facts here do not, in any conception of the principle, bring the case within those overriding operations in which by their nature the civil law is superseded, conditions in which the responsibility rather is cast upon the civilian to extricate himself as best he can both for his own interest and to avoid interference with them. Although the Orkney in her passage to join the convoy was under a primary duty of alertness to enemy presence of any kind, yet the movement was not what, by any reasonable interpretation, could be called actual operations against the enemy. It was a period not of encounter but anterior to possible encounter, a period of apprehension, of lookout, of watchfulness with a view to detection ; but, at the same time, a period in which duties to civilian interests were, in fact, intended to be continued. In such circumstances, unless the exercise of care is, at the moment, incompatible with that paramount vigilance, I can see no ground for excusing the failure to exercise it. It has not been suggested that any feature or requirement of that duty operated to the slightest degree in the faulty navigation: it was, by the facts themselves, demonstrated that the observance of the rules would have been as indifferent to the fulfilment of the naval duty as was their disregard. In that character of action, there is no public interest to exempt the individual from the consequences of his delinquency; and in view of the role that goods of every conceivable kind now play in war, practical considerations would be clearly against it. That was the view of the President in the court below, and I think he was right.\nThere remains the claim for limitation of damages, on which the President held against the Crown. The latter, by its defence, sought the benefit of s. 649 of the Canada Shipping Act:\u2014\n649. (1) The owners of a ship, whether registered in Canada or not, shall not in cases where all or any of the following events occur without their actual fault or privity\n* * *\n(iii) Where any loss or damage is, by reason of the improper navigation of the ship, caused to any other vessel \u2026\nbe liable beyond an amount based on the vessel's tonnage. Mr. Mackenzie challenges the right of the Crown both to avail itself of this provision and to raise the question by the plea. He argues that the matter is controlled by s. 650 which, \"where any liability is alleged to have been incurred by the owner of a British or foreign ship\" permits the owner to apply to a judge of the Exchequer Court to determine the limited amount for which he is liable and to distribute that amount ratably among whoever may be claimants. The section contemplates two or more claims made or apprehended: other proceedings in the same or other courts may be stayed; provision is made for bringing in persons interested, and for the exclusion of those who do not claim within a specified time.\nIt seems to be settled in England that where there is only one claimant, the matter can be raised by a defence and determined in the action: Wahlberg v. Young 9, where the claim was for damage to a tow by stranding; Beauchamp v. Turrell 10, a claim by a widow of a member of a crew who had, through a defective rope, fallen into the sea and drowned. The same procedure was followed in Waldie v. Fullum 11. But it is obvious that if other claimants are apprehended, the issue cannot be conclusively adjudicated in an action limited to one alone; in that case a counterclaim directed to the plaintiff and all other claimants can be resorted to: The Clutha 12. The purpose of s. 650 is to determine, once for all, whether limitation is in order or not and to conclude the question against all interests. Since the vessel and her cargo were, here, a total loss, the question of other claimants should be cleared up, and it would seem to me to be improper to enter upon that question as the action now stands in this Court.\nMr. Varcoe argued his right to limitation on another ground. It is a recognized rule that the Sovereign \"may avail himself of the provisions of any Act of Parliament\": Chitty's Prerogatives, p. 382. Where liability, then, on the same footing as that of a subject, is established, giving a right to damages, I can think of no more appropriate enactment to which that basic rule of the prerogative could be applied than to a statutory limitation of those damages.\nIf it should appeal that there are no other or apprehended claims, then the preliminary condition of actual fault or privity of the Crown will be determined by a judge of the court and the tonnage at the same time ascertained. It may be that, prima facie at least, the circumstances of a collision themselves exclude the existence of fault or privity, and I do not at the moment see how, on the facts shown here, there can be any doubt upon it. If other claims appear, the matter will be dealt with according to the procedure of the Court.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal subject to a variation in the judgment at trial by adding thereto a declaration that the Crown is entitled to avail itself, under the conditions prescribed, of s. 649 of the Canada Shipping Act, 1934, limiting liability. The Crown will be at liberty to take such steps toward the determination of the question of limitation as it may be advised. There will be no costs in this Court.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Estey, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKerwin J.:\u2014On February 13, 1945, a collision occurred on the high seas between His Majesty's Canadian frigate Orkney and the respondent's ship Blairnevis. In its petition of right filed in the Exchequer Court of Canada, the respondent claimed from His Majesty the King damages suffered by it as a result of the loss of its ship. The President 13, found that negligence on the part of the Commander and officers of the frigate alone had caused such damages, declared that His Majesty should pay the amount thereof, and directed a reference to the Registrar to determine the proper sum. Her Majesty the Queen now appeals.\nThe claim of the respondent is based upon s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 34) which, as amended in 1938, reads as follows:\u2014\n19. The Exchequer Court shall also have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nWith this must be read s. 50A of the Exchequer Court Act as enacted in 1943:\u2014\n50A. For the purpose of determining liability in any action or other proceeding by or against His Majesty, a person who was at any time since the twenty-fourth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight, a member of the naval, military or air forces of His Majesty in right of Canada shall be deemed to have been at such time a servant of the Crown.\nIn the Court below it was argued that s. 19(c) must be restricted to claims based on negligence occurring within Canada. Such a contention was abandoned before us but in view of at least one other question that requires consideration, I deem it advisable to state that I concur in the opinion of the President. To the reasons given by him, I would add a reference to the wording in s. 50A : \"a member of the naval, military or air forces of His Majesty in right of Canada\", which contemplates that such a servant of the Crown may perform a negligent act within the scope of his duties or employment outside the limits of Canada. Furthermore, in The Diana 14, the Court was concerned with the Admiralty Court Act, 1861 (24 Vict. c. 10) \"An Act to extend the jurisdiction and improve the practice of the High Court of Admiralty\", s. 7 of which enacted:\u2014\nThe High Court of Admiralty shall have jurisdiction over any claim for damage done by any ship.\nThis was held to confer jurisdiction over a cause instituted as a result of a collision between foreign vessels in foreign waters. Similarly upon a consideration of s. 19(c) the conclusion is reached that the Exchequer Court has jurisdiction in the present proceedings. It has always been held that s. 19(c) imposed liability upon the Crown as well as conferred jurisdiction upon the Exchequer Court. This, it should be noted, is the Exchequer Court proper and not on its Admiralty side. Where the events complained of arise in a province, the law that applies is the provincial law as between subject and subject as of the date of the enactment of the relevant provisions imposing such liability, unless, of course, Parliament has chosen to establish the standard of care of its own officers or servants. The question here is as to the law to be applied where a collision occurred on the high seas between one of His Majesty's Canadian warships and a private merchant ship registered in Scotland.\nThe words that formerly appeared at the end of s. 19(c) \"upon any public work\" were omitted in 1938 and it was by s. 1 of c. 25 of the Statutes of 1943-44 that s. 50A was enacted. From that time until the date of the collision, February 13, 1945, the applicable law remained the same. The Canadian Order in Council establishing collision regulations under the authority of the Canada Shipping Act, 1934, c. 44, was not promulgated until April 8, 1948, so that, if any regulations relating to collisions at sea be relevant, the proper ones would be those established by P.C. 259 of February 9, 1897 (Canada). The Naval Service Act, 1944, c. 23, although assented to July 24 of that year was not brought into force by proclamation until October 15, 1945. The previous Naval Service Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 139) therefore applied, and subsection 1 of s. 45 thereof provided:\u2014\n45. The Naval Discipline Act, 1866, and the Acts in amendment thereof passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom for the time being in force, and the King's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions, in so far as the said Acts, regulations and instructions are applicable, and except in so far as they may be inconsistent with this Act or with any regulations made under this Act, shall apply to the Naval Service and shall have the same force in law as if they formed part of this Act.\nThe King's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions (as amended to November, 1943) referred to in this subsection contain, in chapter 16, regulations for preventing collisions at sea. Paragraph 660 states:\u2014\nThe following regulations are to be observed in order to prevent collisions at sea and all executive officers are to make themselves thoroughly acquainted therewith. Then follow regulations identical for present purposes with the Collision Regulations under the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 and with those established by Canada, P.C. 259 of February 9, 1897, including article 19:\u2014\nWhen two steam vessels are crossing so as to involve risk of collision, the vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way of the other.\nTherefore the rule to be followed by His Majesty's Canadian naval ships on the high seas where the proper circumstances existed were set by the authority of the same Parliament which by s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act imposed liability on the Crown.\nThe Orkney had the Blairnevis on her own starboard side. The President found that the Commander and officers of the frigate failed to obey the injunction contained in article 19 and failed to observe the standard of care demanded under the circumstances. I am satisfied on the evidence that this was the correct conclusion and Mr. Varcoe has not persuaded me that the President was in error in finding that there was no negligence on the part of those on board the Blairnevis. However, it was contended that even if the officers of the Orkney were negligent and caused damages, those damages did not include the loss of the Blairnevis because, it was said, that loss resulted from the negligence of the latter's Master and officers in not applying for a tug to take their ship to Liverpool sooner than they did. When such a contention is raised, all the circumstances must be investigated. They are not at all similar to those that existed in The King v. Hochelega Shipping and Towing Co. Ltd. 15, and the evidence set forth in the reasons for judgment in this case in the Court below satisfied me that there is no basis for the contention now under consideration.\nIt was next argued that at the time of collision the Orkney was engaged in warlike operations in a theatre of war and that, therefore, ss. 19(c) and 50A of the Exchequer Court Act did not apply. Reference has been made to several cases but the only one I need mention is Shaw, Seville and Albion Co. Limited v. The Commonwealth 16. That was a decision of the High Court of Australia on a demurrer where, of course, the allegations in the statement of claim were taken as being true. The judgment of Sir Owen Dixon is a carefully reasoned one and I think that he put the position correctly when he stated that the principle that civil liability did not arise for supposedly negligent acts or omissions in the course of an actual engagement with the enemy extended to all active operations against the enemy but that a real distinction existed between the latter and other activities of the combatant services in times of war. In each instance the precise circumstances must be considered and in the present case, in my view, the Orkney was not engaged in a warlike operation against an enemy but in something anterior and preparatory, and the point must therefore be decided against the appellant.\nThe final point raised by the appellant is that in any event it is entitled to a limitation of liability under s. 649 of the Canada Shipping Act. As the owner of the Orkney, the Crown would ordinarily be entitled to take advantage of this provision but it is said that s. 712 of the Act prevents this result. That section provides:\u2014\nThis Act shall not except where specially provided apply to ships belonging to His Majesty.\nIn my opinion this section has no reference to a claim for limitation for liability under s. 649, which can only be put forward by an owner. The President considered that in The King v. St. John Tug Boat Co. Ltd. 17, I had expressed a larger view of the operation of s. 712 but, there, I was considering s. 640 of the Act which deals with the fault of two or more vessels causing damage or loss to one or more of them, their cargoes or freight, or any property on board.\nThe question therefore remains, what order should now be made? The respondent is justified in its contention that the onus is on the appellant to show that the damage or loss happened without its fault or privity : Patterson Steamship Ltd. v. Canadian Co-Operative Wheat Producers Ltd. 18. While in the statement of defence the appellant asked:\u2014\n(b) For a declaration that if His Majesty the King is liable in the-premises he had the right to limit his liability to the sum of $38.92 for each ton of H.M.C.S. Orkney's tonnage, the said tonnage to be determined in conformity with Sections 649 and 654 of the Canada Shipping Act; that he is liable only for the damage resulting from the collision and not for the subsequent loss of the S.S. Blairnevis, and that he is not liable for interest;\nand while s. 650 of the Canada Shipping Act provides that \"The President or the Puisne Judge of the Exchequer Court may\" determine the amount of the owners liability, the usual practice is that an action for limitation of liability would be brought against the present respondent and every person or persons whomsoever claiming or being entitled to claim in respect of the damage or loss alleged to have been occasioned in any way by the collision between the Orkney and Blairnevis on or about February 13, 1945. It is quite probable that little difficulty will be encountered in ascertaining the tonnage of the Orkney but all interested parties should have an opportunity of disputing the claim of the Crown that it is able to bring itself within s. 649 by showing that the damage or loss happened without its actual fault or privity. The judgment appealed from with its order that the respondent recover its costs of the action might well stand. The appeal to this Court should be dismissed subject to an addition to the trial judgment of a declaration that the Crown is entitled to limit its liability in accordance with s. 649 of the Canada Shipping Act 24-25 Geo. V. 1934. c. 44, if it is able to show that the damage or loss occurred without its actual fault or privity. The respondent has won in this Court on all issues except that of limitation of liability. In view of the expense entailed in connection with the preparation and presentation of this appeal on the other points, there should be no costs in this Court.\nThe judgment of Kellock and Cartwright, JJ. was delivered by:\nKellock J.:\u2014I agree with my brothers Kerwin and Rand that the appeal fails on all grounds except as to the right of the appellant to limit liability under s. 649 of the Canada Shipping Act. With respect to the excepted point, I desire to express my own view.\nIn The City of Quebec v. The Queen 19, Strong, C.J., with whom Fournier J. concurred, in considering the provisions of s. 16(d) of the Exchequer Court Act (now s. 19(d)), said at p. 429:\nProceeding upon this principle, we should, I think, be required to say that it was not intended merely to give a new remedy in respect of some pre-existing liability of the Crown, but that it was intended to impose a liability and confer a jurisdiction by which a remedy for such new liability might be administered in every case in which a claim was made against the Crown which, according to the existing general law, applicable as between subject and subject, would be cognizable by the courts.\nGwynne J., with whom King J., concurred, expressed a similar view at p. 449 with respect to paragraph (c) of s. 16 (now s. 19(c)):\nThe object, intent and effect of the above enactment was, as it appears to me, to confer upon the Exchequer Court, in all cases of claim against the government, either for the death of any person, or for injury to the person or property of any person committed to their charge upon any railway or other public work of the Dominion under the management and control of the government, arising from the negligence of the servants of the government, acting within the scope of their duties or employment upon such public work, the like jurisdiction as in like cases is exercised by the ordinary courts over public companies and individuals.\nIn Filion v. The Queen 20, Burbidge J., said at p. 144:\nIt was the intention of Parliament that the Crown should within the limitations prescribed in section 16 of the Exchequer Court Act be liable in any case in which a subject would in like circumstances be liable.\nOn appeal 21, Strong C.J., expressly agreed with the reasons of the trial judge, considering that the question of jurisdiction was precluded by the decision in the Quebec case. Gwynne J. is, I think, to be taken as affirming the view he had already expressed in the earlier case, while Sedgewick J. expressly concurred in that view, considering himself \"bound by the judgment\" in the Quebec appeal. King J. also concurred. That this is the settled jurisprudence of this court, which was never departed from, is, I think, fully established.\nIn Gauthier v. The King 22, the law was again affirmed in the same sense. The matter there in issue was governed by s. 19 of the 1906 statute (R.S.C., c. 140) to which s. 18 of the present statute corresponds. S. 20 of the 1906 statute corresponds to s. 19 of the present statute.\nIn Gauthier's case Fitzpatrick C.J., contrasted the situation with respect to the applicable law under the then ss. 19 and 20. At p. 182 he said:\nI agree also with Mr. Justice Anglin that section 19 of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" merely recognizes pre-existing liabilities; and cases falling within it must be decided not according to the law applicable to the subject matter as between subject and subject, but to the general law of province in which the cause of action arises applicable to the Crown in right of the Dominion. Anglin J., with whom Davies J. also agreed, said at p. 190:\nThere are, however, two fallacies in the appellant's contention\u2014one the assumption that liability ex contractu of the Crown in right of the Dominion depends upon the \"Exchequer Court Act\"; the other, that a series of decisions, culminating in The King v. Desrosiers, (41 Can. S.C.R. 71) holding that a liability of the Crown imposed by clauses of section 20 of that Act is the same as would be that of a subject under like circumstances in the province in which the cause of action arises, applies to cases falling within section 19. This latter provision (originally found in section 58 of 38 Vict. ch. 11) does not create or impose new liabilities. Recognizing liabilities (in posse) of the Crown already existing, it confers exclusive jurisdiction in respect of them upon the Exchequer Court and regulates the remedy and relief to be administered. In regard to the matters dealt with by this section there is no ground for holding that the Crown thereby renounced whatever prerogative privileges it had theretofore enjoyed and submitted its rights and obligations to be determined and disposed of by the Court according to the law applicable in like cases between subject and subject. The reasons for which it was so held in regard to liabilities imposed by section 20, are stated by Strong C.J. in the earlier part of his dissenting judgment in The City of Quebec v. The Queen (24 Can. S.C.R. 420). See, too, The Queen v. Filion (24 Can. S.C.R. 482), The King v. Armstrong (40 Can. S.C.R. 229) and The King v. Desrosiers (41 Can. S.C.R. 71). No other law than that applicable between subject and subject was indicated in the \"Exchequer Court Act\" as that by which these newly created liabilities should be determined. Placing upon that section a \"wide and liberal\"\u2014a \"beneficial construction\"\u2014\"the construction calculated to advance the rights of the subject by giving him an extended remedy,\"\u2014it was the view of the former learned Chief Justice, and is now the established jurisprudence of this Court, that it was thereby\nnot intended merely to give a new remedy in respect of some preexisting liability of the Crown but that it was intended to impose a liability and confer a jurisdiction by which the remedy for such new liability might be administered in every case in which a claim was made against the Crown, which, according to the existing general law, applicable as between subject and subject, would be cognizable by the Courts.\nBut, since section 19 merely recognizes pre-existing liabilities, while responsibility in cases falling within it must, unless otherwise provided by contract or statute, binding the Crown in right of the Dominion, be determined according to the law of the province in which the cause of action arises, it is not that law as applicable between subject and subject, but the general law relating to the subject-matter applicable to the Crown in right of the Dominion which governs. That law in the Province of Ontario is the English common law except in so far as it has been modified by statute binding the Crown in right of the Dominion.\nIn Armstrong v. The King 23, the statement of the law in the same sense was expressly approved on appeal to this court 24, by at least three of the members of the Court, Davies, Maclennan and Duff JJ., while again in The King v. Desrosiers 25., Fitzpatrick J., said at p. 76:\nAll these questions were decided by this court against the appellant in the Armstrong Case (40 Can. S.C.R. 229) on the ground that the law had been settled in a long series of cases; and, on the application for leave to appeal to the Privy Council from that judgment, Lord MacNaghton said as a ground for refusing the application, referring to the decisions of this court:\nThis seems to have been the law for eighteen years,\n(See report of argument in Privy Council, p. 17), (Cf. per Girouard J. in Abbott v. City of St. John (40 Can. S.C.R. 597) at p. 602).\nIn these circumstances, we are of opinion that the judgment in the Armstrong Case is conclusively binding on this court.\nAccordingly, in determining the liability of the Crown in any case under s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act, if the petitioner can make out a cause of action on the basis of the law applicable as between subjects, he thereby makes out a cause of action against the Crown and is entitled to the same relief as he would be entitled to in the former case.\nThe question arises, therefore, as to the law applicable as between subject and subject in circumstances such as are here present. In my view the legislative subject matter with respect to navigation and shipping being exclusively a matter for the federal Parliament, the law applicable in so far as the question of negligence or no negligence on the part of those in charge of the navigation of the Orkney at the material time is concerned, is to be found in the King's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions made applicable by s. 45 of the Naval Service Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 139. Negligence being thus established, it is then necessary, in order to determine the extent of the liability of a subject, to resort to the provisions of the Canada Shipping Act, which is the law applicable, and s. 649 provides the answer.\nIt is contended on the basis of the presence of s. 712 in the Canada Shipping Act that resort cannot be had to that Act in a case such as the present. In my view this is erroneous. The resort to that statute is not at all for the purpose of determining what that statute has to say with respect to the Crown, but as to what it has to say with respect to the liability of a subject. In that inquiry it is obvious that s. 712 is quite irrelevant. When this inquiry is thus answered, it is s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act which applies that answer to the Crown.\nI would therefore vary the judgment below to the extent indicated and would dismiss the appeal otherwise. In my opinion there should be no costs in this court.\nLocke, J. (dissenting in part) :\u2014This action was commenced by a Petition of Right by the respondent company, incorporated in Great Britain, as the owner of the steamship Blairnevis, against the Crown as owner of H.M.C.S. Orkney, in respect of damages caused by a collision between these two vessels which occurred in the Irish Sea on February 13, 1945. The jurisdiction invoked is that vested in the Court by s. 18 of the Exchequer Court Act and the cause of action is based upon s. 19(c) of that Act, in respect of the alleged negligence of certain naval officers, while acting within the scope of their duties, who are to be deemed servants of the Crown by virtue of s. 50A.\nThere are three questions to be determined. The first is as to whether there was negligence on the part of the naval officers which caused the accident: the second, was there contributory negligence on the part of those in charge of the Blairnevis: and the third, whether, if there be liability upon the Crown, is it entitled to limit the amount of that liability under the provisions of s. 649(1) of the Canada Shipping Act of 1934.\nI agree with the contention of counsel for the Crown that the International Rules of the Road, not being by their terms made applicable to the Crown, did not apply to H.M.C.S. Orkney at the time in question. While the King's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions referred to in s. 45 of the Naval Service Act (R.S.C. 1927, cap. 139) were not proven at the trial of this action, the matter has been contested on the footing that they were in effect at the time in question and that they are identical in their terms with the International Rules of the Road, and that this is a fact should, in my opinion, be accepted in disposing of this appeal. In The Truculent 26, Willmer J. expressed the view that a breach of these regulations was a breach of the duty owed by His Majesty's ships to other mariners. I do not share this view but it is unnecessary for the disposition of the present case to decide the matter. I respectfully agree with the learned President of the Exchequer Court 27 that the fact that the International Rules of the Road, as established by Order-in-Council P.C. 259 dated February 9, 1897, require that when two vessels are crossing so as to involve risk of collision the vessel which has the other on her starboard side shall keep out of the way of the other, that this rule has been almost universally adopted for a very long time past by ships of seafaring nations, and that an identical rule forms part of the King's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions affords evidence from which the inference may properly be drawn that the course prescribed is in accordance with good seamanship, and that failing to comply with it is negligent conduct. In addition, the failure of the naval officers to keep a proper lookout, which was found to have contributed to the accident, was a failure to take that reasonable care in the circumstances to avoid injury to the property of others, which is the duty of those at sea as well as ashore. In my opinion, the inference was properly drawn in the present matter that it was the negligent acts of the two naval officers referred to in the reasons for judgment of the learned President which were the proximate cause of the collision and the resulting damage. I am further of the opinion that the defence that at the time of the collision the Orkney was engaged in warlike operations to protect merchant vessels against enemy action and that the Crown cannot, therefore, be held liable for loss, fails for the reasons given by the learned President. Upon the issue of contributory negligence, I also agree with his conclusion.\nThe third question arises by reason of the contention that, if liable, the Crown is entitled to the benefit of the provisions of s. 649(1) of the Canada Shipping Act of 1934. So far as relevant to the present proceedings, that section reads:\u2014\nThe owners of a ship, whether registered in Canada or not, shall not, in cases where all or any of the following events occur without their actual fault or privity, that is to say\u2014\n* * *\n(iv) where any loss or damage is, by reason of the improper navigation of the ship, caused to any other vessel, or to any goods, merchandise, or other things whatsoever on board any other vessel;\nbe liable to damages \u2026 to an aggregate amount exceeding thirty-eight dollars and ninety-two cents for each ton of the ship's tonnage. The respondent contends that any such claim on behalf of the Crown is excluded by s. 712 of the Act reading:\u2014\nThis Act shall not, except where specially provided, apply to ships belonging to His Majesty.\nThe claim to limit the liability was advanced in paragraph 19 of the Statement of Defence and, by the prayer for relief, a declaration was asked that if His Majesty was liable in the premises he had the right to limit his liability in conformity with the provisions of ss. 649 and 654 of the Canada Shipping Act. The right to so limit the liability, if I appreciate correctly the argument advanced by counsel for the Crown, is that as the position of the Crown in respect of claims under s. 19(c) is the same as if the claim was asserted against a subject qua employer and as a subject would be entitled to invoke the benefit of s. 649, so may the Crown. Secondly, it is said that under the principle that the Crown may invoke the benefit of any statute, though not named in it and presumably, therefore, not being bound by its provisions, it may rely upon s. 649.\nIn support of the first contention, we have been referred to a passage from the dissenting judgment of Strong, C.J. in City of Quebec v. The King 28. The claim of the appellant in that case was considered by a majority of the Court to be based upon ss. (c) of s. 16 of the Exchequer Court Act, which first imposed liability upon the Crown under certain circumstances in respect of the negligence of its servants, but the learned Chief Justice considered that any right of the City must depend upon ss. (d) which gave jurisdiction to the Court to hear and determine:\u2014\nEvery claim against the Crown arising under any law of Canada or any regulation made by the Governor in Council.\nIt was in considering this subsection that Strong C.J. said (p. 429) as to its interpretation and, after referring to a passage from the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Attorney-General of the Straits Settlement v. Wemyss:29\nProceeding upon this principle, we should, I think, be required to say that it was not intended merely to give a new remedy in respect of some pre-existing liability of the Crown, but it was intended to impose a liability and confer a jurisdiction by which a remedy for such new liability might be administered in every case in which a claim was made against the Crown which, according to the existing general law, applicable as between subject and subject, would be cognisable by the Courts. Gwynne, J., who disagreed with the Chief Justice as to the proper disposition to be made of the appeal, referred to ss. (c) of s. 16, which, in his opinion, gave to the Exchequer Court \"the like jurisdiction as in like cases is exercised by the ordinary courts over public companies and individuals.\"\nIn The Queen v. Filion 30, Sedgwick, J. quoted the passage from the judgment of Gwynne, J. in the City of Quebec case, from which the above quotation is taken, as authority for finding that ss. (c) not only created a liability but gave jurisdiction to the Court.\nIn Gauthier v. The King 31, where the claim was in contract, Anglin J. (as he then was), in discussing liabilities imposed by s. 20 of the Exchequer Court Act (the former s. 16), said that no other law than that applicable between subject and subject was indicated in the Exchequer Court Act as that by which these newly created liabilities should be determined and, following this, quoted from the judgment of Strong, C.J. in the City of Quebec case the passage above cited.\nThese statements, in so far as they are applicable to the construction of ss. (c) of s. 19 of the Exchequer Court Act, are, in my opinion, authority only for this, that the same events which, upon the application of the maxim respondiat superior, impose liability upon a subject qua employer, apply in determining the liability of the Crown in that capacity. That question is entirely distinct from the matter in question here, which is whether the liability so imposed upon the Crown may be limited in its extent by a statute which, by its terms, is declared to be inapplicable to the Crown. Nothing said by the learned members of this Court in the above mentioned cases or in any others to which we have been referred was directed to any such question.\nIn England the liability of the owners of vessels in respect of harm caused without their actual fault or privity has been restricted by various statutory enactments since 1733 (Mayers Admiralty Law, p. 161). S. 503 of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 limited the damage to \u00a38 for each ton of the ship's tonnage. That section, with changes which do not alter its meaning, was incorporated as s. 921 in the Canada Shipping Act (c. 113, R.S.C. 1906) and re-enacted as s. 903 in the revision of 1927. When the new Canada Shipping Act was enacted in 1934 and the previous Act repealed as well as the Merchant Shipping Acts of 1894 to 1898, in so far as they were part of the law of Canada, the section was enacted in its present form.\nS. 4 of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854 provided that the Act should not, except as provided, apply to ships belonging to His Majesty, As section 741 the provision formed part of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894. When the Canada Shipping Act of 1906 was enacted, however, while by a number of sections (of which s. 4 was an example) particular parts of the statute were declared to be inapplicable to ships belonging to His Majesty, there was no such provision in Part XIV of which s. 921 formed a part, nor was there any such section in that part of the Canada Shipping Act as it appeared in the Revised Statutes of 1927 of which s. 903 formed a part. When, however, the new Act was passed in 1934 and the Merchant Shipping Acts of England, in so far as they formed part of the law of Canada, were repealed, s. 712 was enacted in the precise terms of s. 741 of the Act of 1894.\nParliament thus, discarding the manner which had been adopted in the earlier Canada Shipping Acts of exempting His Majesty's ships from the operation of defined parts of the Act, adopted the form of the legislation which had been in effect in England of providing generally that, except where specially provided, the Act should not apply to them. It is clear that, with certain exceptions provided by the terms of the statute which are irrelevant to the present consideration (such as sections 557 to 564), none of the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 were ever held to apply to vessels of His Majesty's Navy. It is no doubt for this reason that when the Crown Proceedings Act, 1947 (c. 44), which for the first time imposed liability upon the Crown in respect of torts committed by its servants or agents, was enacted, s. 5(1) provided that:\u2014\nThe provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1940, which limit the amount of the liability of the owners of ships shall, with any necessary modifications, apply for the purpose of limiting the liability of His Majesty in respect of His Majesty's ships; and any provision of the said Acts which relates to or is ancillary to or consequential on the provisions so applied shall have effect accordingly. There is no such legislation in Canada.\nIt is, however, to be noted that while it is the \"owners of a ship\" who are entitled to the benefit of the limitation of liability by s. 649(1), s. 712 says that the Act shall not, except where specially provided, apply to ships belonging to His Majesty. In my opinion, s. 712 should be construed as applying to or in respect of ships belonging to Her Majesty and that, accordingly, the limitation of the liability of His Majesty qua owner is excluded by s. 712. To construe that section otherwise would be, in my judgment, to fail to interpret the section in such manner as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the enactment, as required by s. 15 of the Interpretation Act.\nThe contention that the Crown may take advantage of s. 649(1) is apparently based upon a principle which is stated in Chitty on the Prerogatives of the Crown, p. 382, in the following terms:\u2014\nThe general rule clearly is that, though the King may avail himself of the provisions of any Acts of Parliament, he is not bound by such as do not particularly and expressly mention him.\nWhen the necessity arises and, in my opinion, it does not arise in the present case, it will be necessary to consider the entire accuracy of this statement. As to this, I refer to the comments of Scrutton, L.J. in Cayzer v. Board of Trade 32. The right to invoke the statute is asserted as an exercise of the prerogative and there is no room, in my opinion, for its exercise when the matter has been dealt with by Parliament. In Attorney-General v. De Keyser's Royal Hotel 33, Lord Dunedin said in part:\u2014\nThe prerogative is defined by a learned constitutional writer as \"The residue of discretionary or arbitrary authority which at any given time is legally left in the hands of the Crown.\" Inasmuch as the Crown is a party to every Act of Parliament it is logical enough to consider that when the Act deals with something which before the Act could be effected by the prerogative, and specially empowers the Crown to do the same thing, but subject to conditions, the Crown assents to that, and by that Act, to the prerogative being curtailed.\nHere s. 712 provides that any provision of the Act may be made applicable to the Crown and the provisions of s. 649 and the following sections have not been so made applicable. Lord Atkinson said in part (p. 539) :\u2014\nIt is quite obvious that it would be useless and meaningless for the Legislature to impose restrictions and limitations upon, and to attach conditions to, the exercise by the Crown of the powers conferred by a statute, if the Crown were free at its pleasure to disregard these provisions, and by virtue of its prerogative do the very thing the statutes empowered it to do.\nThere is no authority binding upon us to which we have been referred or of which I am aware where His Majesty has been held entitled to the benefit of the provisions of a statute which, by its terms, declares it to be inapplicable to the Crown.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs subject to limitation of liability under s. 649 of the Canada Shipping Act, 1934.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Lucien Beauregard.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C.

Moffat Q.C. for the A.G. of Canada.\nTASCHEREAU, J.\u2014In view of the practice that was followed for many years, I believe that the appellants thought that they were entitled with the tacit consent of the owners, to keep possession of the logs they had found afloat or resting on the shore. They were, I think, left under the honest impression, as a result of previous happenings, that they were entitled to receive forty per cent of the market value of the logs they had recovered, or sell them after ten days, remitting sixty per cent to the owners. I can find no elements of criminality attached to the act done by the appellants.\nI would allow the appeal, and quash the conviction.\nRAND, J.:\u2014There is no doubt that the accused acted on the fact or the reasonable belief in the fact that they had permission from the owners to salvage logs on the understanding that they would be entitled to compensation to the extent of 40 per cent of the value which could be deducted from the sale price realized by them or paid by the owner on delivery up of the logs. On that state of facts that no offence has been committed under sec. 394 (b) of the Code seems to me to be scarcely arguable. The word \"fraudulently\" carries through the entire section; and, regardless of that, on the language of (b) to import an offence from such objective acts divested of intent would be a new departure in the interpretation of criminal legislation.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the judgment of acquittal. KELLOCK, J.:\u2014The appellants were convicted under the provisions of section 394 (b) of the Criminal Code for, on August 20, 1951, having in their possession certain saw-logs which had been found adrift in a river in Canada and unlawfully did refuse to deliver up the said sawlogs to the proper owner thereof or to the person authorized by such owner to receive the same. The appellants had for some years followed the practice of picking up sawlogs found adrift at the mouth of the Fraser River and the adjacent waters or on the shores. Thereafter they informed the British Columbia Forest Service, asking that department to scale the logs so taken. In due course, this was done by an officer of the department, which then sent a copy of the scale to the appellants and, in the case of logs bearing a visible mark, a copy was also sent to the respective owners. It was the practice for the appellants to wait a period of ten days thereafter and at the end of that time to dispose of the logs, remitting sixty per cent to the owners and retaining forty per cent for their own services.\nAccording to the evidence, the purchasers of such logs from the appellants would be furnished by the department or obtain from the department the original scale showing the names of the owners of marked logs. The evidence also shows, and counsel for the respondent argued the case on the basis that, as found by the trial court, the owners of the particular logs here in question had followed this practice with the appellants for some four or five years. The majority in the court below[2] were, however, of opinion that in such circumstances, the appellants, having in the present instance refused to give up the particular logs to the owners on demand, there was no defence to the charge. Section 394 (b) reads as follows:\n394\u2014Everyone is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to three years' imprisonment who\n(b) refuses to deliver up to the proper owner thereof, or to the person in charge thereof, on behalf of such owner or authorized by such owner to receive the same, any such timber\u2026\nIt might well be said that this section contemplates that the owner or his agent who demands possession of the timber has not, qua the person to whom the demand is addressed, disentitled himself to possession. However that may be, the section is to be considered, as counsel for the respondent concedes, with section 990(2), which reads:\nPossession by the accused\u2026 of any such timber\u2026 shall, in all cases, throw upon him the burden of proving that such timber\u2026 came lawfully into his possession\u2026\nIn view of this provision, no offence was disclosed in the circumstances conceded to exist in the case at bar where the appellants, acting in accord with the practice as between them and the owners of the logs here in question, had taken possession of the logs with the consent of the owners on the implied basis that if they did so, the owners were willing to remunerate them for so doing.\nIn these circumstances, I think there was no ground upon which the acquittal could have been properly set aside. I would allow the appeal and set aside the order below.\nESTEY, J.:\u2014The appellants were charged that on the 20th day of August, 1951, they refused to deliver up to the owners, the Vanwest Logging Co. Ltd., saw-logs in their possession and thereby committed an offence contrary to s. 394 (b) of the Criminal Code. They were acquitted in the County Court Judge's Criminal Court, but in the Court of Appeal[3] the majority of the learned judges directed a conviction.\nThe appellants were engaged in the business, recognized in British Columbia, of collecting logs that have become separated, as those here in question, from their booms and are afloat or resting on the shore.\nA few days prior to August 20, 1951, the appellants, in the course of their business, collected a number of logs, including those here in question bearing the mark 1-Q-1, the property of the Vanwest Logging Co. Ltd. The appellants notified the Forestry Service, whose employees then scaled the logs and under date of September 4 the Forestry Service notified the appellants of its charge therefor in the sum of $117.45 and added:\nUpon receipt of your CERTIFIED CHEQUE for $177.45 or cash, the original Scale and Royalty Account will be released to you which will enable you to dispose of these logs.\nThis amount of $117.45 was paid by the appellants. Either on the same date (September 4) or prior thereto the Forestry Service notified the Vanwest Logging Co. Ltd. of the existence of these logs in the possession of the appellants and, as a consequence, on September 4 the latter wrote the appellants as follows:\nWe have received a letter from the Forest Service that the following logs were scaled at the Ft. Nanaimo Street, South Vancouver for your account:\n2 pcs. No. 2 Fir 859 Feet Mark 1Q1\n9 pcs. No. 3 Fir 3,213 Feet Mark 1Q1\nKindly forward proceeds, from these logs after making deductions for salvage, etc.\nThe appellants, upon receipt of this letter, deducted the salvage and forwarded the proceeds as requested, thereby becoming owners of the logs.\nThe Vanwest Logging Co. Ltd. had their logs insured with the B. L. Johnson, Walton Company Limited, insurance brokers, who employed a group of men to collect the logs, afloat or on the shore, of their insured. When one of their employees, Carson, on August 20, found the logs here in question in the possession of the appellants the latter refused to deliver them to Carson, as agent for the owners, unless the salvage was settled for, which Carson was not prepared to do. He reported to his employer, the B. L. Johnson, Walton Company Limited, and the latter obtained a letter from the Vanwest Logging Co. Ltd. reading as follows:\nThe undersigned, being the registered owner under the Forest Act of Timber Mark 1-Q-1 do hereby authorize you or your agent nominated in writing, to demand and secure possession on my\/our behalf of any logs bearing the above mark or marks found in possession of any unauthorized person or persons whatsoever.\nAnd for so doing, this shall be your sufficient warrant and authority.\nDated at Vancouver, B.C., this 20th day of August, 1951.\nThe phrase \"any unauthorized person or persons whatsoever\" in this letter is not explained. It may be that it would include those who were in the business and in the habit of dealing with the Vanwest Logging Co. Ltd., which would include the appellants. This much is significant, that the record does not suggest that Carson or another officer or agent of the B. L. Johnson, Walton Company Limited, in any conversation with any officer or agent of the Vanwest Logging Co. Ltd., mentioned when obtaining the letter that the logs were in the possession of the appellants. However, the B. L. Johnson, Walton Company Limited gave this letter to Carson who, with another letter from the B. L. Johnson, Walton Company Limited to himself authorizing him, on its behalf, to demand the logs from any unauthorized person, again interviewed the appellants and demanded the logs. The appellants took the same position to the effect that when the salvage was paid they would surrender the logs and Carson took the position that they were not entitled to salvage. As a consequence of this refusal criminal proceedings were taken against the appellants. The learned trial judge found as follows:\nI do not think there is any criminal intent on the part of these men whatever. They were carrying on the practice\u2014there is always the Court of Appeal\u2014that is why I say the custom between Vanwest and these men existed for four or five years. Every exhibit there is against you.\nHere the practice has gone on 29 years, according to your own witness; then all at once, they take criminal proceedings. It sounds very much like private prosecution. I am not going to say any more about it.\nThe learned trial judge's report made under s. 1020(2) of the Criminal Code reads in part:\nIn this particular case I not only believe the evidence of all the Crown witnesses but also the very candid evidence of the accused Gaunt who gave evidence on behalf of himself and his partner Watts.\nI found the accused not guilty, my reasons being:\u2014\n(a) There was nothing fraudulent in their action.\n(b) The accused came lawfully in possession of the logs in question.\n(c) A custom had been established between the actual owners of the logs and the accused as to the payment of salvage, both before and after the enacting of Sec. 394B of the Canadian Criminal Code. An arrangement had been made between the owners and\/or their agent or agents as to the payment of the salvage.\n(d) I doubted the delegation of the authority from one agent to pass along the authority to another agent.\n(e) I doubted whether the logs were picked up in a river, as set out in the indictment.\nThe Court of Appeal accepted the finding of the learned trial judge, but the learned Chief Justice, with whom Mr. Justice Smith and Mr. Justice Bird agreed, was of the opinion that \"fraud is not an element required to be proved in a prosecution under '(b)' of Sec. 394\" and apparently treated the word \"fraud\" as equivalent to mens rea. Mr. Justice Robertson and Mr. Justice O'Halloran were of the opinion that mens rea is an essential ingredient of the offence defined in s. 394 (b). Section 394 reads:\n394. Drift Timber.\u2014Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to three years' imprisonment who,\n(a) without the consent of the owner thereof, (i) fraudulently takes, holds, keeps in his possession, collects, conceals, receives, appropriates, purchases, sells or causes or procures or assists to be taken possession of, collected, concealed, received, appropriated, purchased or sold, any timber, mast, spar, saw-log, shingle bolt or other description of lumber, boom chains, chains, lines or shackles, which is found adrift in, or cast ashore, or lying upon or imbedded in the bed, bottom, or on the bank or beach of any river, stream, or lake, in Canada, or in the harbours or any of the coast waters, including the whole of Queen Charlotte Sound, the whole of the Strait of Georgia or the Canadian waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, of British Columbia, or (ii) wholly or partially defaces or adds or causes or procures to be defaced or added, any mark or number on any such timber, mast, spar, saw-log, shingle bolt, or other description of lumber, boom chains, chains, lines or shackles, or makes or causes or procures to be made, any false or counterfeit mark on any such timber, mast, spar, saw-log, shingle bolt, or other description of lumber, boom chains, chains, lines or shackles; or\n(b) refuses to deliver up to the proper owner thereof, or to the person in charge thereof, on behalf of such owner, or authorized by such owner to receive the same, any such timber, mast, spar, saw-log, shingle bolt, or other description of lumber, boom chains, chains, lines or shackles.\nIt is a general rule that mens rea is an essential ingredient of criminal offences. Its meaning varies in relation to different offences, but it is generally described by Cave J. as \"some blameworthy condition of the mind,\" Chisholm v. Doulton[4] , or by Chief Justice Robertson as \"at least an intention to do a wrong or to break the law,\" Rex v. Stewart[5] , Tremeear, 5th Ed., p. 18; Russell on Crime, 10th Ed. p. 25.\nWhile an offence of which mens rea is not an essential ingredient may be created by legislation, in view of the general rule a section creating an offence ought not to be so construed unless Parliament has, by express language or necessary implication, disclosed such an intention. Parliament created or defined the indictable offences under s. 394 (a) and (b) in one sentence. Although it is not necessary to decide the point, the grammatical construction of the sentence, as well as the history of the section, suggests that Parliament intended the section should be construed in a manner that the word \"fraudulently\" is an essential ingredient of each of the offences therein defined. Even if it be assumed that the word \"fraudulently\" is not included under the offence defined in s. 394 (b), it does not follow that mens rea is not an essential ingredient thereof.\nIn Bank of New South Wales v. Piper[6] , in the first part of the section an offence was created of which \"with a view to defraud\" was an essential ingredient, while in the latter part the offence created did not include these words and their Lordships of the Privy Council found no \"ground for construing the section as if the words 'with a view to defraud' had been inserted\" in the latter part. Their Lordships went on to point out the distinction between a specific intent and mens rea as essential ingredients of an offence. In the Piper case a fraudulent intent was required in the first part, yet while that was not required in the second part it did not follow that mens rea was not an essential ingredient. Even if, therefore, the word \"fraudulently\" should not be construed to apply to all the offences under s. 394, as above suggested, it does not follow that mens rea would not be an essential ingredient of the offence under s. 394 (b). At p. 389 their Lordships stated:\nIt was strongly urged by the respondent's counsel that in order to the constitution of a crime, whether common law or statutory there must be mens rea on the part of the accused, and that he may avoid conviction by shewing that such mens did not exist. That is a proposition which their Lordships do not desire to dispute; but the questions whether a particular intent is made an element of the statutory crime, and when that is not the case, whether there was an absence of mens rea in the accused, are questions entirely different and depend upon different considerations.\nIn cases when the statute requires a motive to be proved as an essential element of the crime, the prosecution must fail if it is not proved. On the other hand, the absence of mens rea really consists in an honest and reasonable belief entertained by the accused of the existence of facts which, if true, would make the act charged against him innocent\u2026 The circumstances of the present case are far from indicating that there was no mens rea on the part of the respondent\u2026 Then he knew that he had not the written consent of the mortgagee; and that knowledge was sufficient to make him aware that he was offending against the provisions of the Act, or, in other words, was sufficient to constitute what is known in law as mens rea.\nParliament, in s. 394 (b), defined an indictable offence in the same sentence with one in which fraud must be found as an essential ingredient and provides the same maximum penalty of three years for each offence. That is understandable if mens rea is an essential ingredient under s. 394 (b), but, if one who is acting with an honest and reasonable belief that what he is doing is right and involves no breach of the law is guilty of the offence and liable to the same punishment, it involves a consequence that, apart from express language, ought not to be attributed to Parliament. As stated by Sir Richard Couch, \"absence of mens rea really consists in an honest and reasonable belief entertained by the accused of the existence of facts which, if true, would make the act charged against him innocent.\" Piper case, supra, at p. 389.\nMoreover, in the main, statutory offences that have been construed not to include mens rea as an essential ingredient have been enacted to promote public safety, health or morality. Section 394 is placed in the Criminal Code under the general heading \"Offences Resembling Theft\" and, therefore, directed to wrong doing in respect of property.\nSection 990(2) places the onus upon one charged with any one of the offences under s. 394 to prove that the sawlogs \"came lawfully into his possession.\" It would, therefore, seem that Parliament intended that if one had sawlogs lawfully in his possession he could retain them if he had a right thereto in the nature of a lien for services performed which the business or practice here gave to the appellants.\nThe evidence here does not justify the conclusion that the business or practice followed by the appellants existed as far back as 1892. It does, however, establish that it has existed over a sufficiently long period to justify the conclusion that these provisions were never directed against one who engages in the business of gathering saw-logs with the intent and purpose of returning them to the owner upon payment of salvage, or of purchasing them from the owner upon a basis recognized by both owners and others in the business, and all with the assistance and co-operation of a department of government.\nWith great respect to the opinion of the learned judges who entertain a contrary view, it would appear that mens rea is an essential ingredient of the offence under s. 394 (b) and the evidence here did not establish that the appellants possessed that essential ingredient.\nThe appeal should be allowed.\nLOCKE, J.:\u2014The relevant facts in this matter are stated in the dissenting judgment of Robertson J.A.[7] and it is unnecessary to repeat them.\nWhether or not Dickenson knew at the time he wrote to the appellants on September 4, 1951, that the logs referred to in the scale and royalty account No. 92492 were those of which Carson had demanded possession on August 20, that letter and the subsequent transaction between Gaunt and his partner and the Vanwest Logging Company Limited, whereby the former paid to the latter sixty per cent of the value of the logs, support the view that there was at the time in question an outstanding offer by the owners of these logs to pay to beachcombers either forty per cent of the market value of logs of that company which had gone adrift and been recovered qua salvage, or to sell them such logs for sixty per cent of their market value.\nI respectfully agree with the reasons and with the conclusion of Mr. Justice Robertson and would allow this appeal.\nCARTWRIGHT, J.:\u2014For the reasons given by my brother Estey I agree with his conclusion that mens rea is an essential ingredient of the offence defined in clause (b) of section 394 of the Criminal Code. The findings of fact made by the learned trial judge, as set out in his oral reasons delivered at the conclusion of the trial and in his report made pursuant to section 1020(2) of the Code, appear to me to indicate not merely that mens rea on the part of the appellant was not established but that it was expressly negatived.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge. FAUTEUX, J.:\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed. In enacting sections 394 and 990 of the Criminal Code, Parliament intended to provide a protection of the right of ownership of things therein mentioned and assure its adequate exercise by punishing such encroachments of the same as are described in the sections. These provisions necessarily assume the existence of a right of ownership and are therefore operative in the measure in which such a right or its exercise is not otherwise affected or conditioned either by laws of a competent legislature or by the very person vested with it. It cannot be presumed, for instance, that Parliament intended, by enacting ss. (b) of s. 394\u2014i.e. by making the refusal to deliver to the owner a crime\u2014, to defeat a contract authorized in civil matters under the terms of which a right to retain the logs until payment for services rendered would be given by the party owning these logs to the party gathering them.\nIn the present case, no one suggested that the appellants have, in relation to the logs in question, committed the offence described in paragraph (a) of s. 394. As to the charge actually laid against them under paragraph (b) of s. 394, the trial Judge found\u2014and this finding is supported by the evidence\u2014in an existing custom, an implied understanding between the appellants and the owners entitling the former, at the time when the logs would have to be delivered, either to be paid by the latter for their services or to purchase the logs they collected upon a basis recognized by both. The circumstances of this case do not bring the appellants within the scope of the sub-section on which they were charged.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellants: G.

This finding was upheld by a majority in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. There was evidence to warrant the finding of contempt and there was no substance to the objections raised as to the granting of the injunction, the jurisdiction of the trial judge and the procedure adopted by him.\nPer Rinfret C.J., Rand and Kellock JJ.: The large numbers of men involved and the public nature of the defiance of the injunction rendered the conduct in question contempt of Court criminal in character. Consequently no appeal lay to the Court of Appeal.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , affirming, O'Halloran J.A. dissenting, a committal order[2] for breach of an ex parte labour injunction.\nR.J. McMaster and A. B. MacDonald for the appellants.\nD. M. Gordon Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice, Rand and Kellock, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014The question which lies at the threshold of this appeal is one as to the jurisdiction and practice of the court with respect to contempt in circumstances such as are here involved. The Court of Chancery has for centuries enforced its orders by contempt proceedings, but it is well settled that such orders, when made merely in aid of execution of process for the benefit of a party, are to be regarded as purely civil in nature. It is equally well settled that conduct which renders appropriate contempt proceedings in aid of execution may have a criminal aspect as well.\nIn Wellesley v. The Duke of Beaufort[3] , Lord Brougham had occasion to deal with the matter in a case of the clandestine removal from the proper custody of a ward of court. In holding that the contempt there in question was criminal and not civil and that no privilege attached to a Member of Parliament in such cases, the Lord Chancellor said at page 665:\nThe line, then, which I draw is this; that against all civil process privilege protects; but that against contempt for not obeying civil process, if that contempt is in its nature or by its incidents criminal, privilege protects not:\nThere are many statements in the books that contempt proceedings for breach of an injunction are civil process, but it is obvious that conduct which is a violation of an injunction may, in addition to its civil aspect, possess all the features of criminal contempt of court. In case of a breach of a purely civil nature, the requirements of the situation from the standpoint of enforcement of the rights of the opposite party constitute the criterion upon which the court acts. But a punitive sentence is called for where the act of violation has passed beyond the realm of the purely civil.\nIn Ambard v. Attorney-General of Trinidad[4] , not an injunction case, Lord Atkin at page 74 said:\nEveryone will recognize the importance of maintaining the authority of the Courts in restraining and punishing interferences with the administration of justice, whether they be interferences in particular civil or criminal cases or take the form of attempts to depreciate the authority of the Courts' themselves. It is sufficient to say that such interferences when they amount to contempt of Court are quasi-criminal acts, and orders punishing them should, generally speaking, be treated as orders in criminal cases,\u2026 In Izuora v. Reginam[5] , Lord Tucker, in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, uses the following language:\nIt is clear that the appellant's conduct was treated by the judge as being contempt of a criminal kind, viz:\n\u201cany act done\u2026 calculated to bring a court or a judge of the court into contempt or to lower his authority\"\nor something \"calculated to obstruct or interfere with the due course of justice or the lawful process of the courts\": see R. v. Gray (2) (1900) 2 Q.B. 40.\nIn in re Armstrong[6] , Vaughan Wiliams, J., as he then was, indicated the distinction between the two classes of contempts at page 329 as follows:\nBut I do not think in the present case there is any element of personal contempt, or any offence committed for which Mr. Isaacson could be sent to prison as a punishment. I think that any imprisonment ordered in the present case would be by way of civil process, and would determine ex debito justitiae as soon as the person committed yielded obedience to the order of the Court and paid the costs.\nThe question arises as to the characteristics of criminal contempt of court as distinguished from mere disobedience of process. Halsbury, Vol. 7, 2nd edition, page 2, treats the subject thus:\nContempt of court is either (1) criminal contempt, consisting of words or acts obstructing, or tending to obstruct, the administration of justice, or (2) contempt in procedure, consisting of disobedience to the judgments, orders, or other process of the Court, and involving private injury.\nThat this division is not, in the view of the editors, a mutually exclusive one, is clear from the following appearing on page 24:\nContempt in procedure, unaccompanied by circumstances of misconduct,\u2026 is a contempt in theory only,\u2026 In circumstances involving misconduct, contempt in procedure partakes to some extent of a criminal nature, and then bears a twofold character, implying as between the parties to the proceedings merely a right to exercise and a liability to submit to a form of civil execution, but as between the party in default and the State, a penal or disciplinary jurisdiction to be exercised by the Court in the public interest.\nReference is made in support of the text last quoted to the judgment of Lindley L.J. in Seaward v. Patterson[7] . The statement in the note to the text quoted from page 2 that\nThe distinction between criminal contempt and contempt in procedure appears in some cases to be a narrow one; e.g., if a party to an action disobeys a prohibitory order, such disobedience, even though wilful, is contempt in procedure, whereas persons who aid and abet such disobedience, and are not parties to the action, are guilty of criminal contempt. \u2026 The true distinction seems to be that one offender is seeking, though under a mistaken view, to enforce his rights, while the other is simply obstructing the course of justice.\nis, therefore, not to be read without keeping in mind that \"contempt in procedure\" may itself be criminal if accompanied by \"circumstances involving misconduct.\"\nIt does not therefore follow from the statement in the note that, even in the view of the editors, disobedience by a party to a prohibitory order, can never be more than a civil contempt.\nIn Seaward v. Paterson an injunction had been granted restraining the use of certain premises in a particular manner. The appellant was not a party to the proceedings but was aware that the injunction had been granted. It was held by the Court of Appeal that although not bound by the injunction any more than any other member of the public, the appellant was, like other members of the public, bound \"not to interfere with and not to obstruct, the course of justice.\"\nIn his judgment in Scott v. Scott[8] , the question in that case being whether the conduct there in question amounted to criminal contempt, if so, there being no right of appeal, Lord Atkinson reiterates that mere disobedience to an order of the court, even though wilful, does not amount to criminal contempt. In his view the conduct of the appellant in question in Seaward's case was purely civil contempt. Lord Atkinson criticized the judgment of Lindley L.J., in that case at pages 555-6 with respect to disobedience to an injunction by a person not a party to the proceedings. He regards the language of Lindley L.J., which he quoted, as failing to \"grapple with the absurdity\" of considering conduct on the part of a non-party as criminal while considering the same conduct by a party as civil. He said at p. 459:\nIt is difficult to conceive that a judge of Lord Lindley's well-known knowledge, ability and acuteness of mind would have gone through this long analysis of the subject without ever suggesting that either or both, of the kinds of contempt of Court with which he dealt was necessarily criminal, if he had so regarded it.\nAll that Lord Atkinson is insisting on is that mere disobedience, whether by a party or a stranger, is not necessarily criminal. But it may be so, depending upon the nature and quality of the conduct involved. At p. 461 he repeats (in speaking of In re Freston[9] , a case involving the authority of the court to discipline its officers) that\nthis case, so far from being an authority that disobedience per se of an order of Court, irrespective of the nature of the thing ordered to be done, is a criminal offence, is an authority to the contrary.\nI think, however, having regard not only to the judgments in Seaward's case, but to the position taken by counsel for the appellant, that both court and counsel considered they were dealing with a case of criminal contempt.\nAt p. 554, Lindley L.J., points out that it was argued for the appellant that\nthe only course to pursue would be to proceed against him by indictment.\nThis, of course, is not language appropriate to civil contempts, although no objection to entertainment of the appeal was raised by the respondent. A similar situation had occurred in Reg. v. Jordan[10] , as Lindley L.J., himself had pointed out in O'Shea v. O'Shea[11] .\nThe judgments in Seaward's case are relevant to the case at bar only from the point of view that conduct in the face of an injunction, while not necessarily criminal, is not necessarily purely civil either. It may be either, depending upon the nature and quality of the conduct in question in any particular case.\nAt page 555, Lindley L.J., said:\nA motion to commit a man for breach of an injunction, which is technically wrong unless he is bound by the injunction, is one thing; and a motion to commit a man for contempt of Court, not because he is bound by the injunction by being a party to the cause, but because he is conducting himself so as to obstruct the course of justice, is another and a totally different thing. The difference is very marked. In the one case the party who is bond by the injunction is proceeded against for the purpose of enforcing the order of the Court for the benefit of the person who got it. In the other case the Court will not allow its process to be set at naught and treated with contempt. In the one case the person who is interested in enforcing the order enforces it for his own benefit; in the other case, if the order of the Court has been contumaciously set at naught the offender cannot square it with the person who has obtained the order and save himself from the consequences of his act. The distinction between the two kinds of contempt is perfectly well known, although in some cases there may be a little difficulty in saying on which side of the line a case falls.\nWhile the contrast Lord Lindley draws is between contempt proceedings as mere process against a party for the purpose of compelling obedience to an order of the court in the interests of the party obtaining it and proceedings against a person not a party who has \"contumaciously set at naught\" the order, and while he does not indicate that in the latter case the contemp again may be either civil or criminal, I think the apparent omission is explained by the fact, already pointed out, that the court was in fact dealing with conduct which all concerned regarded as criminal. Lord Lindley, at p. 553, said that he regarded the case as \"not anywhere near the line. It seems to me a plain straight forward case.\"\nAt p. 558, Rigby L.J., said:\nI will only say a few words on the argument of Mr. Seward Brice with reference to the jurisdiction of the Court in matters of contempt of Court with relation to injunctions. Unless I entirely misapprehended that argument, it went so far as this, that the Court has no jurisdiction to commit for contempt by way of punishment; but that the jurisdiction is an ancillary or subsidiary jurisdiction in order to secure that the plaintiff in a suit shall have his rights. I do not think that that can be for a moment maintained \u2026 That there is jurisdiction to punish for contempt of Court is undoubted. It has been exercised for a very long time \u2026 and it is a punitive jurisdiction founded upon this, that it is for the good, not of the plaintiff or of any party to the action, but of the public, that the orders of the Court should not be disregarded, and that people should not be permitted to assist in the breach of those orders in what is properly called contempt of Court.\nRigby L.J., was not speaking, and did not find it necessary to speak of civil contempt. It would appear that North J., the judge of first instance, had also regarded the appellant's contempt as criminal. The actual committal was for a definite term. This is punishment as opposed to an order of the civil type exemplified in Avery v. Andrews[12] .\nThe authorities make it plain that a party and a nonparty are on exactly the same footing so far as contempt of court is concerned. In Wellesley v. The Earl of Mornington[13] , the court refused to commit a servant of the defendant, who was not a defendant, for breach of an injunction but, as appears at page 181, on a motion to commit him for contempt the court did so. Again, as pointed out by Lord Atkinson, the view taken as to the nature of the contempt does not appear from the report and that is not important from the standpoint of the case at bar. Avery v. Andrews[14] , may also be referred to.\nIn re Eede[15] , the appellant had been struck off the roll of solicitors for having permitted his name to be made use of in an action by an unqualified person. The Court of Appeal held that an appeal lay as the order was not made in a criminal cause. Lord Esher referred to the pertinent section of the Attorneys and Solicitors Act 1843, which authorized the striking off and also authorized the unqualified person to be committed to prison. He pointed out that the section recognized that in dealing with a solicior the court was merely exercising its disciplinary powers but that\nit is easy to see that that punishment inflicted on the unqualified person must be in a criminal matter; but the Act obviously draws a clear distinction between the two cases.\nIn re Freston, supra, is an example of the first class of case.\nIn my opinion the statement in Oswald, the 3rd edition, at page 36, correctly distinguishes between civil and criminal contempts:\nAnd, generally, the distinction between contempts criminal and not criminal seems to be that contempts which tend to bring the administration of justice into scorn, or which tend to interfere with the due course of justice, are criminal in their nature; but that contempt in disregarding orders or judgments of a Civil Court, or in not doing something ordered to be done in a cause, is not criminal in its nature. In other words, where contempt involves a public injury or offence, it is criminal in its nature, and the proper remedy is committal\u2014but where the contempt involves a private injury only it is not criminal in its nature. It is with this distinction in mind that the judgment of Chitty J., in Harvey v. Harvey[16] , is, I think, to be read. The learned judge there said:\nInterference with a ward of Court, interfering with the due administration of justice, as by intimidating witnesses, or ill-treating a process server, and breaches of an injunction, were and still are all alike treated as in the nature of offences punishable by committal.\nInterference with a ward of court, Wellesley v. Duke of Beaufort, supra; intimidation of witnesses, R. v. Steventon[17] ; ill-treating a process server, Lewis v. Owen[18] ; are all criminal contempts.\nIt should be said that the conduct in question in Scott v. Scott involved nothing in the nature of a \"public\" injury if it could be considered to be contempt at all. In the view of Viscount Haldane and of Lord Shaw, the order for hearing in camera was ultra vires and therefore there could be no contempt of that order at all. Earl Loreburn considered that the publication \"in good faith\" of the evidence by the petitioner could not be treated as in contempt of an order she had herself obtained \"for her protection\". Lord Atkinson arrived at the same result as Viscount Haldane, but considered the order for hearing in camera to have been \"spent when the case terminated.\"\nIn the case at bar the plaintiff's ship had arrived at the government dock in Nanaimo on the 7th of July, 1951, for the purpose of loading lumber then piled upon the dock. It appears that a strike of members of a union, known as The International Wood Workers of America, was then in progress but it was not the members of that union but longshoremen who were required for the purpose of loading the ship on its arrival. It appears, however, that the woodworkers had established a \"picket line\" at the entrance to the bridge leading to the government dock, by reason of which the plaintiff company was unable to have the loading continued, the longshoremen refusing to cross. So far as the evidence shows, the Woodworkers Union had no interest in the actual lumber on the dock to be loaded nor in the ship nor its crew. In this situation the plaintiff applied ex parte to Clyne J., and obtained an injunction restraining the defendants, their servants and agents, from\n(a) \"watching or besetting, or causing to be watched or beset, the M.S. Vedby at the government assembly dock in the City of Nanaimo and the approaches thereto by land or sea;\"\n(b) \"from preventing or interfering with the loading of the said M.S. Vedby;\"\n(c) \"and from preventing access to and from the said ship by any persons seeking to embark or depart from the said ship.\"\nThis order was served upon the appellant Tony Poje on the 15th of July and a copy was posted on the bridgehead in the presence of Poje and six pickets. On the following day, July 16, the Sheriff returned at noon and found at approximately 12.25 p.m., one hundred and fifty men at or near the landward end of the bridge and another thirty at its end nearest the ship. The bridge is some forty or fifty feet wide and its landward end was completely blocked. The legend \"I.W.A. is on Strike for Better Wages and Conditions\" was displayed on posters being carried and was also posted on the railing of the bridgehead as well as chalked on the asphalt road.\nThe Sheriff informed the men at the bridgehead that longshoremen would report to load the ship at approximately 12.30 p.m., and shortly before that, when the pickets showed no sign of dispersing, he announced to the men at both ends of the bridge that he was the Sheriff of the county and read the material parts of the order of Clyne J., informing them that he considered them all to be in contempt of court but the pickets paid no attention to him. Shortly after this several cars carrying longshoremen entered the area, one driving directly to the bridge. The occupants of this car were interrogated by the appellant Tony Poje as to who they were. On being informed that they were longshoremen and being asked if they were to load, Poje replied in the negative. Matters remained in this situation until about 2.15 when the Sheriff left, the longshoremen remaining in the area outside the picket line.\nOn returning at 4.30 p.m., the Sheriff found the situation the same, with the longshoremen still waiting. On returning at 7 p.m. he found no longshoremen and six pickets only. On July 18 and 19 the Sheriff went to the locality on a number of occasions and found on each occasion only six pickets patrolling the bridgehead. He found none on Sunday, July 20. On the following day he again attended on a number of occasions throughout the day and found only six pickets at the bridgehead.\nOn July 22, at 8.30 a.m. the situation was the same. Later in the morning the Sheriff was instructed that longshoremen would be reporting for work at 1 p.m. At 10 a.m., on going to the area, he found sixteen pickets there, and at 12.15, he found fifty men assembled at the bridgehead and along the roads leading to it with the appellant Tony Poje apparently in charge. At approximately 12.30 p.m. the number of men at the bridgehead increased to approximately seventy. The Sheriff again read the operative parts of the injunction order, told those present they must disperse, but that did not occur, there being some \"snickers\" at the Sheriff's statement. On this occasion all of the appellants were in the group. At this time the longshoremen were present on the other side of the street opposite the bridgehead.\nOn July 22 the defendants served notice of motion for an order setting aside the order of Clyne J., and on the following day the plaintiff moved to commit those concerned for disobedience to the said order. These motions were returnable on the 24th of July, but on that day the parties to the action settled their differences, it being agreed that the plaintiff would discontinue his action and the motion to commit, and that the motions would be spoken to on the 29th.\nOn the last mentioned day the matter came before the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia, who was informed by counsel of the position. The learned Chief Justice indicated to counsel, however, that on the material, it appeared that there might have been a contempt of which the court should take notice. He, therefore, adjourned the matter to the 8th of September, informing counsel that the Sheriff would be asked to report and that the Court might decide to initiate contempt proceedings of its own motion. On the 8th of September, the Sheriff was called and deposed to the facts set out above, and the learned Chief Justice then announced that he proposed to direct the issue of writs of attachment, directed to the appellants and others, under which they would be taken into custody and brought before the court on September 15, but that they would be allowed to remain in the custody of counsel for the appellant upon his undertaking that they would be brought before the court on that day, or they might be permitted to enter into their own recognizance.\nWrits of attachment were accordingly issued and the matter came before court [19] again on the 15th of September. The appellants were represented by counsel, the Sheriff repeated the evidence he had given on the previous occasion. He was cross-examined and counsel for the appellants on this occasion admitted that the Sheriff's \"evidence\" as to the congregation of men on the various occasions was in accordance with the fact. The orders here in question were made on the following day.\nIt is plain, I think that so far as the learned Chief Justice was concerned, he considered that the facts before him amounted to a criminal contempt of court. So far as the immediate parties to the action were concerned, all matters in question between them had been adjusted. The plaintiff was no longer interested in enforcement of the injunction and had agreed to drop the proceedings for enforcement by way of committal. It was the court which at that point stepped in, the proceedings from then on being purely punitive. In my opinion the learned Chief Justice had jurisdiction so to deal with the matter.\nIt is idle to suggest that on the evidence the presence of these large numbers of men blocking the entrance to the bridge was intended merely for the purpose of communicating information. That had been very efficiently done for a considerable time by the six pickets with their signs or cards, and the notices at the bridgehead. The congregation of the large numbers of men at the times that the longshoremen were to arrive had no other object or effect than to present force. The context in which these incidents occurred, the large numbers of men involved and the public nature of the defiance of the order of the court transfer the conduct here in question from the realm of a mere civil contempt, such as an ordinary breach of injunction with respect to private rights in a patent or trade-mark, for example, into the realm of a public depreciation of the authority of the court tending to bring the administration of justice into scorn. It is to be observed that the nuisance created by the incidents referred to brought the appellants within the scope of s. 501 of the Criminal Code; Reners v. The King[20] . S. 165 as well as s. 573 were also infringed. There is no doubt that the appellants and those associated with them were acting in concert. Their conduct was thus entirely criminal in character in so far as these specific offences are concerned. Over and above these offences, however, the character of the conduct involved a public injury amounting to criminal contempt.\nIn these circumstances, I think the order of the learned Chief Justice was properly made, and as the proceeding was a criminal proceeding, an appeal to the Court of Appeal was not competent; Storgoff v. Attorney General[21] . It follows that the rules of court are inapplicable as they apply only in civil proceedings.\nIt is immaterial by what means the appellants were in court. The court had jurisdiction to deal with them when there; R. v. Hughes[22] . Nor do I think the order of Clyne J., may be treated as in any sense a nullity. There is no application before us for leave to appeal directly to this court from the order of the learned judge of first instance under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, but having regard to my view as above expressed, I would not, in any event, be inclined to grant such leave.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nKERWIN J.:\u2014I am unable to discover any substance in the objections raised by the appellants to what are in my opinion mere matters of procedure so far as concerns the order of Mr. Justice Clyne granting an injunction. Furthermore, on any view of the matter, Chief Justice Farris[23] had jurisdiction, sitting in a Court of record, to hear the application for attachment or committal for the alleged contempt in failing to obey that injunction, and I can find no merit in any of the objections raised to the procedure adopted by the Chief Justice. There was evidence sufficient to warrant the finding of contempt and I am unwilling to interfere with the orders made by him with respect to the various appellants. Without expressing any opinion as to the other matters argued, I would dismiss the appeal without costs.\nESTEY, J.:\u2014I agree the appeal should be dismissed. The learned Chief Justice[24] , in my opinion, upon this record had jurisdiction to hear the motion. I am in respectful agreement with the conclusions of the majority of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal[25] , both with respect to the objections taken to the order as made by Mr. Justice Clyne and the findings of the learned Chief Justice. In view of the foregoing it is unnecessary to determine the nature and character of the contempt.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: A. MacDonald.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E. Pepler.\n[1] [1952] 7 W.W.R. (N.S.) 49.\n[2] [1952] 6 W.W.R. (N.S.) 473.\n[3] (1831) 2 Russ. & My. 638.\n[4] (1936) 105 L.J.P.C. 72.\n[5] [1953] 1 All.

Out of the net annual income properly divisible as profits, annuities were to be paid to his widow and his two sons and the Hospital for Sick Children, the remainder, if any, to be invested and accumulated. Upon the death of the survivor of the widow and the two sons the business was to be sold and the proceeds and all the remainder of the residue of the estate was to be paid to the Hospital. R. died in 1918, and his widow in 1947, predeceased by the two sons. In carrying on the business the trustees set up a reserve for depreciation with respect to the plant and the buildings and upon the sale of the property the next of kin claimed such write-offs were subject to the provisions of the Accumulation Act and that the amount realized by the sale showed them to have been excessive to such an extent that the whole amount so written off should be considered as income to which they were entitled.\nHeld: The reserve was not an accumulation within the meaning of the Accumulations Act.

Mason, Q.C., Terence Sheard, Q.C., G.E. Hill, Q.C. and A.B. Whitelaw for appellants.\nC.F.H. Carson, Q.C., A.S. Pattillo, Q.C., and A.J. Macintosh for the Trustees appointed by Hospital for Sick Children, respondents.\nJ.L. Stewart for Trustees of the Estate of John Ross Robertson, respondent.\nG.T. Walsh, Jr., for The Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Incurables, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Kellock, Estey and Cartwright, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014Under the will here in question the testator placed the residue of his estate in the hands of trustees upon trust \u201cthat my executors and trustees shall carry on the business of the Evening Telegram and for that purpose shall hold all the real and personal property connected therewith until the same shall be sold as hereinafter set out.\u201d It will be noticed that for the purpose of carrying on the business the testator makes no distinction between the real and personal property.\nIn paragraph 16 the testator directed that out of the \u201cgeneral income\u201d of his estate, including \u201cthe net annual income properly divisible as profits\u201d derived from the Telegram business, there should be paid certain annuities, including annuities in favour of his wife and his two sons and the Hospital for Sick Children. The testator further directed the remainder of such net annual income, if any, to be invested and the accumulated fund to be disposed of \u201cas the remainder of my estate is disposed of.\u201d\nBy paragraph 22 he directed that upon the death of his widow and sons, the Telegram business, including the land and buildings, should be sold and that the proceeds and all the remainder of the residue of his estate should be paid to trustees for the Hospital for Sick Children, which institution, subject to any outstanding annuities, was to be entitled to the income, there being a gift over to other charities in certain contingent events.\nThe testator died on the 31st of May, 1918, and his widow on July 11, 1947, she having been predeceased by, the two sons. By a judgment of the Supreme Court of Ontario in 1939, it was held that any accumulation of income under paragraph 16 of the will subsequent to twenty\u2011one years from the date of the testator\u2019s death was prevented by virtue of the Accumulations Act, the income so affected being payable to the next-of-kin of the testator.\nOn the passing of the trustees\u2019 accounts subsequent to the death of the widow, it appeared that the trustees, in carrying on the business, had set up a reserve for depreciation with respect to plant and buildings and that the amounts credited to this reserve subsequent to the twenty-one year period up to the date of the death of the widow, amounted to some $770,970. The next-of-kin, in their \u201csurcharge\u201d claimed that the\nsaid sum of $770,970.23 so held in reserve by the trustees, should be credited to income account accruing to the tenants pur autre vie (the next-of-kin) and cannot be credited to capital account except to the extent that the trustees can show that part or all thereof is required to make good impairment of capital on the realization of the Evening Telegram business and can show that any such transfer to capital account is not contrary to the provisions of the Accumulation Act.\nThe appellants say that the amount written off over the period in question for depreciation is subject to the provisions of the Accumulations Act and that such amount has been shown, by reason of the price realized on the sale of the business, to have been excessive to such an extent that the whole amount of the write-offs should now be considered income to which the appellants are entitled.\nAs stated in their factum, however, the appellants\ndo not suggest that the executors acted improperly in setting up a reserve for depreciation.\nNor do they\nimpugn in any way the general accounting practice of setting aside out of profits an annual amount as a reserve for depreciation. As pointed out by the learned judge of first instance,\nIt is not suggested that the trustees acted improperly in setting up a reserve for depreciation at the rates which they applied, but it is claimed that in view of subsequent events and information now available, that we are now in a position to say what the real depreciation was, and that the amount deducted from income was unnecessary to preserve the capital assets.\nThe \u201csubsequent events\u201d to which the learned judge refers, and \u201cthe realization of the Evening Telegram business\u201d referred to in the surcharge, are one and the same.\nIt may be observed at this point that the business was sold as a going concern, inclusive of the goodwill, and that there was no distribution of the purchase price with respect to any particular asset. The appellants rely on an appraisal of the physical assets obtained at the instance of the trustees for the purposes of sale indicating values of the physical assets considerably in excess of book values, less the depreciation reserve, as a basis for the contention that the price received reflects this excess.\nOn this assumption the appellants contend that, by a species of \u201crelation back\u201d, the write-offs for depreciation were correspondingly excessive and, to that extent, constitute income of which they were deprived during the relevant period, which should now be recouped to them out of the proceeds of sale. The decision in In re Bridgewater Navigation Company,[3], is, in the first instance, relied upon.\nIn the Bridgewater case part of the profits had been carried to a \u201cdepreciation of steamers\u201d reserve, which, on the sale of the undertaking of the company, was held to be income to which the ordinary shareholders were entitled as against the preference shareholders. In my opinion, the fund in question in the Bridgewater case was not at all, however, a true depreciation reserve such as is in question in the case at bar. The fund in the Bridgewater case may have had some elements of a depreciation reserve but it was much more than that. It is sufficient to refer to the judgment of Kay L.J., at p. 333, and particularly to his statement that the reserve was made\nnot on account of any depreciation in fact, but to provide for the possibility of loss in case of the sale of the undertaking as a going concern, or the plant being brought under the hammer. It seems clear from this, that far from being a depreciation reserve in the modern sense, the fund there in question was a contingent reserve set up against a fall in market value should the assets have to be sold either as a going concern or piecemeal by auction. Kay L.J., went on to point out that not only were\nthe plant and works of the company being fully and efficiently maintained in good order and repair out of current revenue\nbut that \u201cpurchases of steamers\u201d were charged against revenue.\nAt page 328 Lindley L.J., with whom Lopes L.J., agreed, said:\nAs regards the depreciation fund, if the company chose, as in fact it did, to keep up the value of its plant, &c., and also to set apart some of its profits to meet unforeseen contingencies, such setting apart was not a necessary proceeding in order to ascertain the divisible profits;\nI think these references are sufficient to make it clear that the \u201cdepreciation of steamers\u201d fund was not a true depreciation reserve in the sense that that word is under consideration in the case at bar. The directors had used revenue for capital purposes, such as the purchase of steamers. The fund was not a reserve against the depreciation of the steamers but against the possibility of a fall in their market value.\nIn Bishop v. Smyrna,[4], to which the appellants also refer, where the decision in Bridgewater was followed, an investment made by the defendant company having fallen in value in the market, the amount of the depreciation was debited to revenue. In the liquidation of the company, when the value of the investment had again risen, it was held that the amount of the appreciation must be treated as revenue. The reserve, like the reserve in the Bridgewater case, was simply a reserve against a fall in market value and has no relation to a true depreciation reserve. This decision illustrates just what was involved in Bridgewater\u2019s case.\nIn my opinion the true nature of a depreciation reserve such as is involved in the case at bar, is illustrated in the decision of the Court of Appeal in In re Crabtree,[5]. In that case the testator authorized his trustees to carry on his business during the lifetime and widowhood of his wife and to pay her \u201cthe profits arising from my business\u201d. The question arose as between the tenant for life and remainderman as to whether, in addition to the cost of repairs to the machinery, the trustees were entitled to deduct from the profits otherwise payable to the wife, an annual sum for depreciation of the machinery at a specified rate on its original value. It was held that this was a proper deduction. The trial judge, Swinfen Eady J., as he then was, said at page 50:\nBut in the ordinary course of ascertaining the profits of a business where there is power machinery and trade machinery which is necessary in order to perform the work of the business, it is, in my opinion, essential that, in addition to all sums actually expended in repairing the machinery, or in renewing parts, that there should be also written off a proper sum for depreciation, and that sum ought to be written off before you can arrive at the net profits of the business, or at the profits of the business; and it is not profit until a proper sum, varying with the class of machinery, with the nature of the business, and with the life of the machinery, has been written off for depreciation.\nThis decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, the passage quoted above from the judgment of Swinfen Eady J., being expressly approved by Cozens-Hardy M.R., and Fletcher Moulton L.J. At page 51 the latter said:\nAll the plant in a business has a lifetime which is longer or shorter in various cases. If a man starts some new mills he keeps them in working order, but if he acted on the supposition that there was consequently no loss of value, or that the machines were not wearing out, he would be deluding himself, and in time find himself much poorer than he expected.\nBuckley L.J., said on the same page:\nThe profits of this business are not ascertained until a sufficient sum has been deducted to meet the depreciation of the machinery.\nOne of the witnesses in his affidavit referred to the saleable value of this machinery. That is not the right standard. Here it is the value of the machinery for the purpose of this business, not the saleable value.\nIt is of interest to observe that the witness McDonald, who testified on behalf of the respondents, gave the following answer in cross-examination:\nQ. Is it a fact that the purpose of the depreciation allowance is to make up the loss of capital in that sense?\nA. To make up the loss in value, not exchange value but loss in value to a business of the capital assets.\nApart from the question as to the proper rate or rates at which write-offs for depreciation in any particular case should be made, and in the case at bar there is no question of that sort, such write-offs are, in my opinion, necessary and proper, and profits or income cannot be ascertained until such write-offs have been made. The theory of such write-offs is maintenance of capital. If there are no profits until after proper write-offs for depreciation have been made, the fact that ultimate realization produces a surplus over book values, a result dependent on market conditions at the time of sale, does not establish that, after all, there were additional profits.\nI think, therefore, that the Accumulations Act has no application. There is, in my opinion, no accumulation in connection with a true depreciation reserve within the meaning of the statute. The reserve, as already pointed out, is, in theory, made to maintain value and not to add to it. In In re Gardiner[6], the will there in question directed a yearly sum out of the rents of leaseholds held for a term of more than twenty-one years from the testator\u2019s death to be applied in effecting and keeping on foot a policy of insurance to secure the replacement at the end of the term of the capital that would be lost through not selling the leaseholds. It was held that the Accumulations Act had no application. Buckley J., as he then was, said at page 699:\nWhat the testator has here directed is not, in my opinion, an accumulation within the Act. All that he has done is to direct that the property shall not foe diminished.\nAfter referring to the judgment of Lindley L.J., as he then was, in Vine v. Raleigh[7], he added:\nI understand him to mean because they simply keep up the property and do not add to it.\nApart from the fact that it may be resorted to at any time for the purposes for which it was set up, a depreciation reserve of the nature of that here in question is intended merely to keep up the initial value of the property and not to add to it. In my opinion, therefore, such a reserve is not within the statute.\nI would dismiss the appeal with all costs to be paid out of the estate, the costs of the Trustees for Estate of John Ross Robertson to be taxed as between solicitor and client. RAND J.:\u2014It is agreed that the direction to carry on the newspaper business, under the conditions laid down, was valid and that the setting aside of the depreciation reserve in the manner and to the extent done was authorized and unobjectionable. These premises furnish the background to the interpretation of art. 16 of the will which reads:\u2014\n16. And upon the further trust out of the General income of my estate including the net annual income properly divisible as profits derived from the Evening Telegram business and the income derived from the purchase money thereof if and when the same shall be sold to pay the following sum, namely,\nI take that to mean that once each year when the \u201cnet annual income properly divisible as profits\u201d derived from the business has been transferred to the general income account of the trustees, the latter, under the article, have no further interest in the income of the business for that year; and that it is only the residue of that general income remaining after payment of the specific bequests that is directed to be accumulated for the beneficiary mentioned in the last paragraph of the article. That this is what the language used means is, I think, unquestionable. If the accumulation of that residue of income had ended at twenty years and the business had then vested in another person, can there be any doubt that the beneficiary of the latter would have been entitled to every asset of the business including the reserve? How, then, can it make any difference that the statute intercepts the accumulation beyond twenty-one years or that the proceeds from the sale of the business rather than the business itself vest in the beneficiary? or that there is the same beneficiary in both cases?\nMr. Sheard\u2019s argument based on In re Bridgewater Navigation Company[8], is vitiated by the assumption contrary to the fact that the profits to be accumulated mean all profits of the business including those placed in the reserve which may ultimately be found to be in excess of the requirements for which they were set aside. In Bridgewater admittedly the common shareholders were entitled to all the divisible profits, and the decision was that that right extended to accumulated earnings undisposed of in the reserves on the winding up. The remaining question is whether the Statute of Accumulations applies to the reserve. The latter is not an accumulation directed by the testator; it is authorized and is voluntary, not directed: it is subject at any time to be resorted to for appropriate application. An accumulation means not only a process in time but a process of maintenance from a beginning, that is, that money placed aside shall be kept intact until the end of a period. The reserve possesses no such character; it does not irrevocably bind any appropriation to it for any period at all; the funds are at all times free and available for the purposes of the business; and its character is quite outside the mischief aimed at by the statute. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that it has not been shown that one dollar of the existing sum represents an actual retention in the fund beyond twenty-one years. Any other view would in reality declare that a direction to carry on a business in the full sense of the term could not extend beyond twenty-one years.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with all costs to be paid out of the estate, including, in the case of the trustees of the Robertson estate, costs as between solicitor and client.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the trustee of the Estate of John Sinclair Robertson, appellant: Macdonald & Macintosh.\nSolicitors for the executors of the Estate of Jessie Elizabeth Cameron, appellants: Bicknell, Cameron & Chisholm.\nSolicitors for the executrix of the will of Irving Earle Robertson, appellant: Holmstead, Sutton, Hill & Kemp.\nSolicitors for the appointed trustees, respondents: Blake, Anglin, Osler & Cassels.\nSolicitors for the Trustees, respondents: Fraser, Beatty, Tucker, Mcintosh & Stewart.\nSolicitors for Grand Lodge, A.F. & A.M., respondents: Kilmer, Rumball, Gordon & Beatty.\nSolicitors for The Children\u2019s Aid and Infants\u2019 Homes of Toronto, respondents: Borden, Elliott, Kelley, Palmer & Sankey.\nSolicitors for the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, respondents: Clark, Gray, Baird & Cawthorne.\n[1] [1952] O.R. 283; 2 D.L.R. 594.\n[2] [1951] O.R. 309; 3 D.L.R. 241.\n[3] [1891] 2 Ch. 317.\n[4] [1895] 2 Ch. 596.\n[5] (1912) 106 L.T. 49.\n[6] [1901] 1 Ch. 697.\n[7] [1891] 2 Ch. 13 at 26.\n[8] [1891] 2 Ch. 317.\n"}

Upon the son\u2019s death the fund was to be divided into as many shares as there should be children surviving him or issue of such children living at his death, one such share to be set aside \u201cin respect of\u201d each surviving child or deceased child leaving issue. No child or issue was to have any other or greater interest in any share than such as should be \u201cexpressly given\u201d to him. Out of the net income each child to be of his share paid a certain sum per annum and each issue out of his share or equal part of a share the same sum. The excess income was to be added to the capital of the shares. On the death of any child of R. the son surviving him the share attributed to the child with any accumulated income was to go as he or she might by will direct and failing such direction, to the issue of such child in equal shares, and in default of issue the share with accumulated income to be added to the other shares, such additions to be treated as if they had at all times been a part of the original shares. Any part of the capital fund or accumulated income at any time undisposed of was to be distributed in accordance with the law of Ontario relating to the distribution of personal estate upon an intestacy among the next of kin to be ascertained at the date of such distribution. If any share or shares or any part of any share of the capital fund was not vested in some person or persons as the beneficial owner or owners at the expiration of 21 years less one day from the date of the death of the last survivor of the son and his child or children and the issue of such child or children born in the lifetime of the testator, such share or shares, part or parts, at the expiration of the said period, was to vest in the person or persons who at that time was or were the person or persons for whose benefit the Trustees were authorized to make payments out of income derived from such share or shares or part or parts thereof. The Testator died in 1929 and upon the termination of the 21 year period from the date of his death s. 1 of The Accumulations Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 4, applied to prevent further accumulation of income of the estate. The direction of the Court was sought as to whether the income so directed to be accumulated should go to a grandson David Fasken Jr., the sole surviving lineal descendant, or to the collateral next of kin of the testator.\nHeld: \u201cKin\u201d or \u201ckindred\u201d is the equivalent of blood relationship; \u201cnext of kindred\u201d defines its degree. Children are \u201cnext of kindred\u201d in the ordinary sense of the words and in s. 29 of The Devolution of Estates Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 103, children as kin, are dealt with first, and it is only if there are no children, meaning issue, that the word \u201cnext\u201d is applied to the remaining kin. As held by the trial judge, the accumulated income should go to the grandson. In re Natt; Walker v. Gammage 37 Ch. D. 517, explained; Withy v.

Swackhamer for executors and trustees, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nRAND J.\u2014This appeal raises a question of the interpretation of a will. The instrument was made in 1924 and the testator died in 1929. At the time of its making, the testator\u2019s only son, Robert, was alive and as well a grandchild, David Jr., the present appellant, then aged about eight years. The son died in 1934 and the testator\u2019s widow in 1935. The son had married twice. To his first wife was born David Jr., and to the second a daughter who died unmarried in 1945. David Jr. has not married. The testator was survived also by four brothers and four sisters. At the time these proceedings were commenced, two of the sisters and thirty-three nephews and nieces, the survivors of deceased brothers and sisters, were living. The widow of Robert is also alive and a party to the appeal, both as executrix of the will of her deceased husband and as administratrix of the estate of the testator\u2019s widow.\nThe estate of the testator was very substantial. The will directed the income from a capital sum to his wife during her lifetime, and from another sum to two children of a deceased cousin, with the capital to their issue and with cross-limitations over of both income and capital: power was given the trustees in their discretion to advance capital to either of the children upon entering business or marriage.\nThe remainder of the estate as a fund was dealt with as follows. From its income, trustees were to pay to the son, Robert, during his lifetime, annually, such a sum as with his income from other sources should make up $30,000; all income not so required was to be capitalized.\nUpon the death of Robert, the trustees were to divide the fund with all accretions into as many equal shares as there should be children of Robert surviving him or issue of such children living at his death, and to set aside one such share \u201cin respect of\u201d each surviving child or deceased child so leaving issue. No child or issue was to have any other or greater interest in any share than such as should be \u201chereinafter expressly given\u201d to him. Each share or portion in case there were more than one issue was to be subject to a spendthrift provision.\nEach child was to be paid out of the net income from his share the sum of $10,000 per annum and each issue out of his share or equal part of a share the same sum. Income beyond such payments was to be added to the capital of the shares. Special provisions were made for discretionary payments to persons under the age of twenty-one. The trustees were empowered also to advance \u201cto or for the benefit of any person then entitled to the benefit from the income of a share or part any sum or sums out of the capital of the share or part.\u201d Clause 16 dealt with the capital in these terms:\u2014\nOn the death of any child of my said son Robert who survives my said son, the share of the said child shall, with any accumulated income thereon, go in manner as he or she shall by will or by deed or other appointment in writing made in his or her lifetime direct, and failing any such direction, to the issue of such child, in equal shares if more than one such issue, and in default of issue the said share, with accumulated income, shall be added to the other shares into which the capital fund was divided as hereinbefore directed, and such additions to be treated for all purposes as if they had at all times been a part of the original share to which such addition is added.\nClause 17 made corresponding provision for the shares or parts attributed to the issue of deceased children of Robert.\nClauses 18 and 19 contemplated the possibilities of undisposed property:\u2014\n(18) In case the said capital fund or any part thereof, or any accumulated income thereon, is at any time undisposed of beneficially by the preceding provisions hereof, whatever is so undisposed of shall be distributed in accordance with the law of the Province of Ontario relating to the distribution of personal estate upon an intestacy, among my next-of-kin to be ascertained as of the date of such distribution.\n(19) Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained, I expressly direct that if by the provisions hereinbefore contained in respect of the said capital fund, and the income derived therefrom, any share or shares or part or parts of any share or shares of the said capital fund, or any of the income thereof, is or are not vested in some person or persons as the beneficial owner or owners thereof at the expiration of twenty-one years less one day from the date of the death of the last survivor of my said son Robert, and his child and children, and the issue of such child and children born in my lifetime, any and every such share or shares, part or parts of any share or shares of the said capital fund, and any of the income thereof not so vested by the provisions hereinbefore contained, shall, at the expiration of the said period of twenty-one years less one day, immediately and absolutely vest in and be transferred by my Trustees to the person or persons who is or are respectively at that time the person or persons for whose benefit my Trustees are authorized to make payments out of income derived from such share or shares or part or parts of a share or shares (any income in my Trustees\u2019 hands to go with the share or part of a share from which it is derived), and I give and bequeath the same accordingly.\nThe income has greatly exceeded the amounts to be paid and as from December 2, 1950, being twenty-one years after the death of the testator, the Accumulations Act has intervened, and the immediate question is in whom the excess income is now vested. Barlow J. held in favour of the appellant as the \u201cnext-of-kin\u201d of the testator as at the expiration of the twenty\u2011one years; the Court of Appeal, with Roach J.A. dissenting, construed the expression \u201cnext-of-kin\u201d in clause 18 to refer to collaterals and to exclude children, and in that situation the case comes before this Court.\nIt will be seen, at the outset, that the testator has endeavoured to confine both income and capital to descendants; clauses 16, 17 and 19 put this beyond doubt; and that fact becomes significant to the interpretation of clause 18.\nThe case for the respondents rests on the assumption that the connotation, as a compound word, of the verbal construct, \u201cnext-of-kin\u201d, which, as a word, is not recognized in any of the standard dictionaries, is to be identified with that of the expression \u201cnext of kindred\u201d in s. 29 of the Devolution of Estates Act (R.S.O. 1950, C. 103) which, it is argued, does not include descendants. The language of the section is:\u2014\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Act the personal property of a person dying intestate shall be distributed as follows: one-third to the wife of the intestate and all the residue by equal portions among the children of the intestate and such persons as legally represent the children in ease any of them have died in his lifetime and if there are no children or any legal representatives of them then two-thirds of the personal property shall be allotted to the wife, and the residue thereof shall be distributed equally to every of the next of kindred of the intestate who are of equal degree and those who legally represent them, and for the purpose of this section the father and the mother and the brothers and sisters of the intestate shall be deemed of equal degree;\u201d\nI find nothing whatever there which treats children as not being of kin or \u201cnext of kindred\u201d. \u201cKin\u201d or \u201ckindred\u201d is the equivalent of blood relationship; \u201cnext of kindred\u201d defines its degree. That children are not \u201cnext of kindred\u201d in the ordinary sense of the words would be absurd and no one suggests it. That property left by a deceased person should pass to those of his blood is one of our deeply imbedded ideas; the question has been, to which of them? Naturally it would be to the nearest in blood, but not all in the same generation have always shared equally. In determining degrees we have followed the rule of the civil law, counting forward or back from the deceased. The limited meaning attributed to \u201cnext-of-kin\u201d as derived from \u201cnext of kindred\u201d results from the latter\u2019s position in the text of the section and its application to ascendants and collaterals; but if, in construing the expression, the emphasis is placed, where it belongs, on the word \u201cnext\u201d, the appropriateness of its use in its plain meaning becomes apparent. As is seen, children, as kin, are dealt with first and it is only if there are no children, meaning issue, that the word \u201cnext\u201d is applied to the remaining kin.\nThe Court of Appeal took In re Natt; Walker v. Gammage,[3] to establish the proposition that \u201cnext-of-kin\u201d means next-of-kin other than lineal descendants. The point raised there before North J. was whether an undisposed share of the residue should be divided among four grandchildren per stirpes or per capita. The two children of the testator had died, and it was argued that the language of the section of the English statute,\nand in case there be no child, then to the next of kindred in equal degree of or unto the intestate, and their legal representatives as aforesaid, and in no other manner whatsoever.\nwhich has its counterpart in the latter part of s. 29 of the Ontario Act, was the applicable provision. The contention of counsel for three of the grandchildren, the descendants of one child, interpreted this language to read as if the words \u201cincluding the descendants of deceased children\u201d, appeared after the word \u201cintestate\u201d and before the phrase \u201cand their legal representatives\u201d. It was in relation to this contention that North J., at p. 521, says:\u2014\nBut I think the true construction is, that the words \u201cnext of kindred\u201d mean next of kindred exclusive of issue of the intestate.\nThis, if I may say so, appears to be obvious from the fact that the language is introduced by the expression \u201cif there is no child\u201d, that is, in the sense of issue. The decision went on the application of the earlier language that \u201cif there is no wife, then all such personal property shall be distributed equally among the children\u201d, including descendants of children, and held the distribution to be per stirpes. That this was the only point decided is the view taken in the standard text books on the subject. The broader question seems to me to be concluded by Withy v. Mangles,[4] affirming the judgment of Lord Langdale, M.R., reported in 49 E.R. 377. Clause 19, dealing with the possible application of the rule against perpetuities, is an overriding provision which must be read with clauses 16 and 17. It provides for the vesting of the capital while a beneficiary is in receipt of income. But it might be that all issue of the son should have died before the period mentioned without having appointed the capital.\nThe possible situations in which clause 18 would operate would include such a failure of issue and of appointment, and as well, the intervention of the Accumulations Act. In the former, the question raised would fall because of the absence of descendants. On the other hand, the limited period of accumulation must certainly have been present to the mind of the testator and, by the interpretation proposed, to exclude the children from this income when by clauses 16 and 17 the transfer to them of the capital by the trustees, either in their discretion or imperatively under clause 19, is provided for, involves a contradiction of the testator\u2019s clear intention.\nMr. Carson stresses the language of clause 13,\nBut no child or issue of a deceased child or my said son shall have any other or greater interest in any share than such as is hereinafter expressly given to him or her.\nLater in the same clause it is declared that,\nIn every case, any right or interest given in any share shall be subject to the limitations of the clause hereinafter contained.\nmeaning the spendthrift provision.\nThe phrases \u201cexpressly given\u201d and \u201cgiven in any share\u201d are intended primarily to rebut any implication that because, say, the income in whole or part of a share goes to a child or that the trustees have discretionary powers to advance any part of its capital, the share is intended thereby to be vested in the beneficiary although its immediate enjoyment is limited; the beneficiary is at any time to be entitled only to what the instrument clearly gives him and nothing more and the shares, in that sense, have so far a notional character. That purpose indicates the meaning to be attributed to \u201cexpressly given\u201d; it means clearly given, and, as shown by the use of the word \u201cgiven\u201d, makes the expression no stronger or weaker than if it had been \u201creally given\u201d. What the testator intended to make unmistakable was that there were to be no benefits by implication: except as to what was given, each share was to remain open.\nThere is nothing to show that \u201cnext-of-kin\u201d has become a recognized locution signifying kin other than children, nor does the reference in clause 18 to the \u201claw of the Province of Ontario\u201d governing intestate estates supply it; and that clause, besides designating the beneficiaries, fixes the time for determining them: Hutchison v. National Refuges for Homeless and Destitute Children[5].\nSince the language used, in its ordinary meaning, includes the testator\u2019s children, of whom the appellant is the sole representative, the onus is on those who seek to exclude him. Mr. Carson has left nothing unsaid in support of the view taken by the Appeal Court, but he has not raised a serious doubt in my mind of the soundness of Mr. Arnup\u2019s contention.\nI would, therefore, fallow the appeal and restore the order of Barlow J. All parties are entitled to costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal out of the estate, those to the executors and trustees of the testator to be as between solicitor and client.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fraser, Beatty, Tucker, McIntosh & Stewart.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Belle Fasken et al: Tilley, Carson, Morlock & McCrimmon.\nSolicitor for the Official Guardian: P.D.

The goods were to be shipped from Montreal to New York for furtherance to a South American country. The evidence consisted of a customs bill of lading, produced from the records of the Collector of Customs at New York, on which a signed entry was endorsed to the effect that the goods had been shipped from the United States destined to a European country. The bill had been prepared for admittance of the goods to the United States and was required by the law of that country.\nHeld: As to counts other than 6 and 7, the document was admissible.\nHeld further: As to counts 6 and 7, the copies of documents before the Court were improperly admitted and the appeal as to these counts was allowed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, reversing the trial judge's decision and convicting the appellant.\nA. Tourigny Q.C. and J. Drapeau for the appellant.\nG. W. Hill Q.C. and J. G. Ahearn Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nRand J. : The charge against the accused was for exporting tin plate from Canada to an ultimate destination not authorized by the permit for the export, and the substantial question in the appeal concerns a rule of evidence.\nThe goods were shipped from Montreal to New York for furtherance by water to a country in South America on bills of lading showing the accused to be the shipper. For admittance to the United States at the border point, what is called a customs bill of lading is made out by the railway on behalf of the shipper from the information furnished on the bill of lading; and since, on such a transit through the United States, the goods must be in bond, the customs bill of lading, supplemented, undoubtedly, by an official seal placed on the car, evidenced the receipt of the goods from the Customs authorities and committed them to the Collector of Customs at New York. The document was produced in court from the records of the Collector by his assistant solicitor. Endorsed on it was a signed entry that the goods had been shipped from the United States destined to a European country.\nThat control of the goods by the customs department of the government, effected by the customs bill of lading, was required by the law of the United States. In order that the transit be cleared, it was necessary that the goods should be exported and the entry to that effect on the records of the Customs Collector made in the course of public duty authenticates that fact. The document accepted in evidence contained such a record, and the question is whether it was admissible. The argument made to us somewhat confused the admissibility of an entry made strictly in the course of business and one made pursuant to a public duty. The rule in, relation to the latter does not seem ever to have been doubted. As early as 1785 in R. v. Aickles 2, it is said:\nThe law reposes such a confidence in public officers that it presumes they will discharge their several trusts with accuracy and fidelity; and therefore whatever acts they do in discharge of their public duty may be given in evidence and shall be taken to be true, under such a degree of caution as the nature and circumstances of each case may appear to require.\nIn Doe v. France 3, Erle J. says:\nIt depends upon the public duty of the person who keeps the register to make such entries in it, after satisfying himself of their truth.\nIn Irish Society v. Bishop of Derry 4, Parke B. says:\nThe bishop in making the return discharged a public duty, and faith is given that they would perform their duty correctly; the return is therefore admissible on the same principle on which other public documents are received.\nIn Richardson v. Mellish 5, in admitting a list showing the names, capacities and descriptions of all persons embarked on a ship, Best C.J., overruling an objection, said:\nFor the purpose of proving the damage, the plaintiff put in a list returned by a captain under the authority of 53 Geo. III, cap. 155. It is contended that that paper was not evidence against third parties. I am decidedly of opinion that there is no foundation for that objection. This is a public paper made out by a public officer under a sanction and responsibility which impel him to make that paper out accurately; and that being the case, it is admissible in evidence, on the principle on which sailing instructions, the list of convoy, and the list of the crew of a ship are admissible.\nThe grounds for this exception to the hearsay rule are the inconvenience of the ordinary modes of proof and the trustworthiness of the entry arising from the duty, and that they apply much more forcefully in the complex governmental functions of today is beyond controversy. They have equal force in the case of an entry made pursuant to a duty under a foreign as well as a domestic law ; People v. Reese 6 (Cardozo C.J.). In the infinite variety of commercial relations we have with the United States, it would be virtually impossible in such a case as that before us to establish proof if this long accepted rule could not be invoked; and since the Court retains a discretion in admitting the document, any special circumstances tending to qualify the dependability of the entry would be subjected to judicial scrutiny.\nIt was urged by Mr. Tourigny, however, that for two of the shipments there was no evidence that the ultimate destination had been other than that authorized by the permit. The original documents in the office of the Customs Collector in New York had been mislaid and were not available and photostat copies tendered were rejected; there is, therefore, no evidence of the destination of export from New York before the Court. It is necessary, then, to consider, first, the precise requirement of the permit that is alleged to have been violated and the extent to which that violation can be said to be shown by the documents before us.\nSec. 5 of the Export and Import Permits Act reads :\nNo person shall export or attempt to export from Canada any goods included in a list established pursuant to section three of this Act except under the authority of and in accordance with a permit issued under this Act.\nThe permit given the accused is headed \"Application for permit to export war materials and other goods\" ; the name of the consignee is Charles Brauner, New York; the country of ultimate destination is stated to be Peru ; and the application is granted \"subject to the conditions entered on the reverse side of this permit.\" No such conditions are shown.\nAll that can be deduced from this, as the charge laid shows, is that to be exported in accordance with the permit, the goods must have as their ultimate destination a point in Peru.\nThe first of these two counts, No. 6, is supported by bill of lading for Car No. 29107 stated to have been shipped in bond to New York City for export \"under T. & E. entry to Callao, Peru.\" ; the second, No. 7, by bill of lading for Car No. 144541, shipped likewise in bond to New York for export \"under T. & E. entry to Callao, Peru.\" The former is endorsed \"intended for S.S. Copgapo, Chilean Line\" ; the latter \"intended for S.S. Santa Louisa, Grace Line.\" I am unable to see how it can be contended that these acts of the accused in Canada contained in the directions and entries on the bill of lading can be taken to evidence a shipment in violation of the permit. A further point was taken that the notice of appeal by the Crown was insufficient. There was admittedly an error in the description of the charges from the acquittal on which the appeal was being taken; but the references to the Court and to the dates of the adjudications made clear to the accused both the error in the description and the judgments against which the appeal was being taken. Mr. Tourigny frankly conceded that the accused was in no way misled.\nUnder sec. 1018 (2) of the Criminal Code the time within which notice of appeal may be given may be extended at any time by the Court of Appeal. The point was considered by that Court in this case, but was rejected, which can only mean that the notice was dealt with in such a manner as brought the appeal properly before the Court. There is no question of the jurisdiction to do that and we would not interfere with a discretion so exercised.\nI would, therefore, alow the appeal as to counts 6 and 7 and dismiss it as to the others.\nAppeal dismissed except as to counts 6 and 7.\nSolicitors for the appellant: A.

The second proviso to s. 17 of the Copyright Act, 1927, R.S.C., c. 32, as amended by 1938 (Can.), c. 27, s. 5, provides that no charitable or fraternal organization shall be held liable to pay any compensation to the owner of any musical work or to any person claiming through him by reason of the public performance of any musical work in furtherance of a religious, educational or charitable object.\nThe respondent, a fraternal organization, carried on various social, charitable and benevolent activities and as a means of raising funds for them, operated a dance hall. The appellant, the holder of the performing rights in certain musical compositions, sued the respondent for infringement, alleging that the respondent without its consent had performed or permitted to be performed the compositions in public in its dance hall. The respondent pleaded that it was a charitable or fraternal organization and that any public performance as alleged by the appellant was in furtherance of a charitable object and it specifically pleaded s. 17 of the Act as amended.\nThe action was dismissed by the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nHeld: The performance of a musical work to be \"in furtherance of\" a charitable object within the meaning of the exemption contained in the second proviso of s. 17 of the Copyright Act, must be a participating factor in the charitable object itself or in an activity incidental to it, for the purpose of which the object may consist of component parts of a cognate character; but it could not be said to be so associated with the object here by its role in the ordinary business entertainment of a dance: there being neither a participation in the object nor in anything incidental to it.\nDecision of the Exchequer Court of Canada [1952] Ex. CR. 162, reversed.\nAPPEAL by special leave from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1 Cameron J., dismissing the appellant's action in damages for breach of copyright by the respondent, and for an injunction.\nH. E. Manning, Q.C. for the appellant.\nH. G. Fox, Q.C. and G. M. Ferguson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nRand J.:\u2014This is an appeal by a company entitled to performing rights in certain copyright musical compositions. The claim is brought against Kiwanis Club of West Toronto, the respondent, a fraternal organization carrying oh various social, charitable and benevolent activities, centering around the city of Toronto. Among other things, it has leased Casa Loma which had been built as a palatial residence but which through the vicissitudes of several decades had been abandoned to taxes and allowed by the city to become almost derelict. The Club sensed the possibilities of a profitable use of the building and premises to enable it to extend its own good works and for the past few-years its foresight has been vindicated by the successful results of its venture. Substantial payments in the nature of rent are made to the city, and all net profits are restricted in their application to charitable purposes.\nAmong the means of raising money adopted is that of holding frequent dances from which the great part of its net income is derived. The Club has availed itself of other uses such as tours of the estate, conducting tea rooms, holding musicales, concerts, sales of souvenirs and refreshments, and other forms of service or entertainment, both with and without charge.\nThe meetings of the Club are held in the building, including the regular weekly luncheon, which serve not only the social purposes of the Club as between its members but enable the details of its administration generally to be discussed and courses of action to be decided upon. A full-time secretary devotes himself primarily to the activities of the centre and there is a staff for carrying them out.\nAgainst the net income of approximately $44,000 for the year 1950 and some $4,000 interest on accumulated profit investments, certain charges or appropriations were called to our attention by Mr. Manning as not being attributable to charitable purposes. Among them was a sum of $1,500 applied to general administration costs of the Club. This, it was argued, could not represent any real service by the organization to Casa Loma nor a contribution to charity. There were sums paid for carrying on a summer camp at which paying as well as non-paying guests were received; in assisting agricultural clubs to spread the knowledge of animal husbandry and in demonstration of tree culture on a particular farm; junior Kiwanis clubs were promoted, a campaign in courtesy and safety in automobile driving likewise; and a large item of over $11,000 paid to the Y.M.C.A. These appropriations of funds were claimed to show the income of Casa Loma not to be wholly devoted to charitable objects and not, therefore, within the statutory exemption claimed by the respondent. But I do not find it necessary to deal further with this feature. That exemption is contained in the second proviso of , s. 17 of the Copyright Act, and is as follows:\u2014\nFurther provided that no church, college, or school and no religious, charitable or fraternal organization shall be held liable to pay any compensation to the owner of any musical work or to any person claiming through him by reason of the public performance of any musical work in furtherance of a religious, educational or charitable object.\nThe question posed is this: is the performance of such music by an orchestra paid for its services at the dances held by the Club an act \"in furtherance of \u2026 a charitable object\" by reason of the ultimate destination of the net profits to charity? This admirable utilization of what would probably otherwise be a wasted property is, except for its general direction by the unpaid officers of the Club, carried on as an ordinary business enterprise, in which service is rendered on a commercial footing : does that ultimate disposal of the net return bring these operations within the proviso so that it can be said that the Club may, carte blanche, use any music it sees fit regardless of copyright?\nOn this question we have had the benefit of thorough argument from counsel for both sides. Mr. Fox, for the respondent, says that every act done in the course of this or any like chain or group of activities is, regardless of its nature, \"in furtherance\" of the concluding charitable act or object. But from this it is at once seen that there can be objects immediate, proximate or remote in relation to the performance. What, then, are we to take as that or those intended by the proviso?\nIt is the \"public performance\" that is to further the object. Now undoubtedly there can be an immediate charitable object in connection with and as part of which a performance can be given. Singing or performing music in and as part of a church service is directly furthering that service, itself a charitable object; an educational meeting with musical interpolations is carried on in a charitable sense and is itself such an object; and in the relief or amelioration of poverty, the accompaniment of the music of an orchestra at a Christmas dinner given to the poor through the means of voluntary contributions is equally so. Since, then, the proviso can be satisfied by a performance in the furtherance of a charitable activity of which it furnishes one of the functions, are we justified in attributing to the proviso the intention to embrace also an ultimate, possible and remote result following a series of disjoined business transactions?\nThe ends to which Mr. Fox's argument leads are plain and undisputed. The Club could organize an opera company for the same purposes as Casa Loma. Opera ventures are notoriously unprofitable, but the \"object\" of the proviso, as Mr. Fox conceded, cannot be made to depend on the actual accrual of profit as the end result: what is looked to is the intention with which the step involving the performance is taken. And so Mr. Britten's \"Peter Grimes\" could be presented to the Toronto public without payment of the fee to which the composer has the right to look for his own subsistence. And there would be no limit to the mode of business to which resort could be so made, provided it involved the performance of music.\nSome light is thrown on the question by para. 7 of the first proviso to s. 17. It exempts \"the performance without motive of gain of any musical work at any agricultural, agricultural-industrial exhibition or fair which received a grant from or is held under Dominion, provincial or municipal authority, by the directors thereof.\" In Composers, Authors & Publishers Association of Canada v. Western Fair Association 2, this was held not to apply to the case of a paid performance by a band as part of an entertainment at a fair to which a special admission fee was charged, the object being both to entertain and to attract attendance. And in The King v. Assessors of Sunny Brae ex p. Les Dames R\u00e9ligieuses de Notre Dame de Charit\u00e9 du Bon Pasteur 3, an exemption from taxation of property used for charitable purposes was held not to apply to a laundry operated by the Sisters, the net income from which went wholly to charity.\nThe performance, to be \"in furtherance of\", must, I should say, be a participating factor in the charitable object itself or in an activity incidental to it, for the purpose of which the object may consist of component parts of cognate character; but it could not be said to be so associated with the object here by its role in the ordinary business entertainment of a dance : there is neither a participation in the object nor in anything incidental to it. We cannot, then, treat the ultimate object here as exempting the performance from the prescribed fees: so to extend the language of the proviso would unnecessarily run counter to those principles of justice which accord to owners, particularly of property which in the truest sense they have created, the accepted privileges of ownership.\nAn injunction is claimed not only in respect of the unauthorized performance of the musical works mentioned in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the claim but also of all musical works included in lists which the appellant may file in the Copyright Office, the exclusive rights to the public performance of which belong to it. Whether or not an injunction can be given such a comprehensive scope, there is not, in this case, sufficient occasion to consider; the question between the parties arises out of the interpretation of the statute, and that now having been settled, the controversy should be ended.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and direct judgment\n(a) declaring the appellant to be the owner of that part of the copyright in the musical works mentioned in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the statement of claim, consisting of the sole right to perform them in public;\n(b) declaring that the respondent has infringed the appellant's right by authorizing the performance of the musical works in public without the consent of the appellant ;\n(c) enjoining the respondent, its agents, servants and employees from infringing the appellant's copyright in the said musical works while comprised in the lists of such works which have been or will be filed by the appellant with the Honourable the Secretary of State at the Copyright Office in Ottawa and while the sole and exclusive right to perform the same in public remains the property of the appellant ;\n(d) damages in the sum of five dollars.\nThe appellant will have its costs of the action and of this appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Manning, Mortimer & Kennedy.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ferguson & Martin.\n1 [1952] Ex.

One of its trucks was damaged while standing in the logging area near to a spar tree of the appellant where it had been placed for loading. This spar tree was used both for yarding logs and for loading them on to the trucks. A log which the appellant was yarding hit and broke a snag with the result that the spar tree fell on the truck.\nThe respondent's action, claiming negligence, was met by the contention that the appellant's liability was excluded by the exempting clause of the contract which provided that: \"The trucks and the personnel operating such trucks shall\u2026 be at the risk of and the responsibility of the truckers and the truckers will provide their own insurance, pay their own workmen's compensation charges and will indemnify\u2026 the company from any claims or damages or for any damage that may occur arising out of the use or operation of the said trucks \u2026\". The action was maintained by the trial judge and by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. The negligence of the appellant was not contested in this Court.\nHeld: (Kellock and Locke JJ. dissenting), that the appeal should be dismissed.\nPer: Rand J.: On the principle followed in Canada Steamships Company v. The King [1952] 1 All E.R. 305, as the exempting clause can be satisfied reasonably by reference to an area not touching the negligence of the company, its language is not to be read as extending to that negligence. Furthermore, the accident arose out of work carried on exclusively by the company and therefore outside the scope of the contract.\nPer: Estey and Cartwright JJ.: The reciprocal obligations contracted by the parties had to do with the loading, hauling and dumping of the logs. The operation in the course of which the truck was negligently damaged had nothing to do with the operation of loading the truck; it was therefore not within the four corners of the contract and the exempting clause did not apply. On the assumption that the words of the clause should apply to the negligence of the appellant in matters within the contract, clear words would be necessary to cover damage caused by negligence in an operation carried on outside the contract.\nPer: Kellock and Locke JJ. (dissenting): Effect can be given to all of the language of the exempting clause only by construing it as covering damage or injury to trucks or drivers caused by the negligence of the appellant as well as to damage to the person or property of third persons caused by reason of the operation of the trucks. As the damage arose within the scope of the contract, the appellant should be exempted from liability.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , upholding the decision of the trial judge[2] and maintaining the action for damages.\nC. K. Guild Q.C. for the appellant.\nAlfred Bull Q.C. for the respondent.\nRAND J.:\u2014Clause 3 of the agreement, on which the contention of Mr. Guild is based, reads:\u2014\n3. IT IS UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED that the trucks and the personnel operating such trucks, shall, at all times during the life of the within contract, be at the risk of and the responsibility of the Truckers and that the Truckers will provide their own insurance, pay their own Workmen's Compensation charges and will indemnify and save harmless the Company from any claims or damage or for any damage that may occur arising out of the use or operation of the said trucks for the term of the within contract.\nConstruing that language as a whole and with the remaining provisions, I have come to the conclusion that it is designed to evidence conclusively the fact that the trucking was to be taken as separate and distinct from the loading and other work carried on by the Logging Company; that the trucking firm was to act as an independent contractor and not in any relation of agency, partnership, sub-contractor, or anything of like nature toward the Company: that, in short, no risk relating to the property or personnel of the Truckers was to be placed upon the Company attributable to any relationship arising from the contract. This may have been quite unnecessary but the language indicates it to have been in the minds of the parties.\nMr. Guild contends that the clause is aimed at the hazards of the work undertaken so far as it involved cooperative or concurrent action by the Company, and that since outside the obligations of the contract the Company would be liable only for negligence, this latter must be imported to give subject matter to the language. The first significant word is \"risk.\" That may denote risks of damage or injury caused to the trucks or personnel by accident, by the negligence of the Truckers themselves or by third parties, or by that of the Company, and it is so far ambiguous: but on the principle followed by the Judicial Committee in Canada Steamships Company v. the Crown[3] , as the clause can be satisfied reasonably by reference to an area not touching the negligence of the party claiming the benefit of it, its language is not to be read as extending to that negligence; and that interpretation is confirmed by the considerations which follow. The word \"responsibility\" is to be related, obviously, to the consequences of conduct of the Truckers. Why should tortious action by the Truckers be declared to be on their own responsibility? Only because of possible effects resulting from the special relations created by the contract. The Truckers are to insure generally. Insurance would cover loss from accident and the negligence of themselves as well as that of third persons; but what of damage caused by the Company? Being of the nature of indemnity, insurance gives rise to subrogation against the wrongdoer: is this subrogation to be negatived in relation to the Company by insuring for its benefit where the damage is the result of its negligence but not so in the case of other wrongdoers? How can we imply such a significant provision? The Truckers will pay their own compensation charges. What could raise a doubt about this? Only that the terms of the contract might seem to create a relationship affecting that obligation by associating in some way the Truckers with the Company in what is, objectively, an entirety of operation. Mr. Guild referred to the provisions of the Act by which where an employee of one class is injured by the negligence of an employee in another class, the latter is charged with the resulting compensation. How the Truckers could, short of bearing the entire award themselves, prevent that transfer from being made under the statute I am unable to see; and what the Truckers are to do is to pay their charges, not compensation to their own employees. This view is strikingly confirmed by the last member of the clause. The Truckers are to \"indemnify and save harmless the Company\" from the consequences specified. To what consequences are these words appropriate? We do not \"indemnify and save harmless\" from or against our own claims or for damage done to us by others. To give them that effect would be to interpret them as an anticipatory release or a declaration that no claims would arise or could be made by the Truckers against the Company. But this familiar phrase must be given its well established meaning. To indemnify and save harmless is to protect one person against action in the nature of claims made or proceedings taken against him by a third person, and it would distort that plain meaning to attribute any other signification to it.\nFinally, the indemnity is to be for damage \"arising out of the use or operations of the said trucks\", that is, those operations or use as being the cause of damage or to which it is attributable. This concluding sentence gathers up the effects of the previous language and furnishes protection in law to the substantive matter of the preceding specifications. It completes a consistent and logically developed expression of a specific area of security to the Company and one which, in the circumstances, the parties can readily be understood to have had in mind.\nThe accident here was not of the nature so envisaged; it arose out of work carried on exclusively by the Company; the fact that the truck was in its vicinity awaiting loading cannot in any sense stamp the resulting damage as arising out of that fact.\nThere remains to be added what is to me a most pertinent question: in this situation of doubtful meaning of their language, for what conceivable reason can we take the parties to have intended that in relation to these associated operations in which there might easily be joint negligence, and as between themselves, the Truckers were to be liable for their negligence while the Company was to be excused? I can imagine none.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs. The dissenting judgment of Kellock and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014I cannot accept the contention of the respondent that paragraph 3 of the agreement here in question extends to breaches on the part of the appellant of its contractual obligations. So to construe the paragraph would nullify such obligations and I do not think any such intention is to be gathered from the terms in which the agreement is expressed.\nLeaving this contention aside, therefore, damage or injury might arise in the course of the carrying out of the contract not only to the person or property of others but also to the trucks and the drivers themselves. The appellant would, however, be liable only for injury or damage arising from negligence.\nIt is said for the respondent that by reason of the agreement between the parties, it might be held that the doctrine of respondeat superior would apply so as to make the appellant liable for claims of third persons and that the terms of paragraph 3 are limited to protection against such claims. I cannot, however, accept this contention. I do not think it can be doubted that the parties to the agreement contemplated that the logging operations, to which the trucking was incidental, were operations involving risk of injury not only to persons or property which might be caused by the trucks but also danger to the trucks and the truck drivers themselves from the mere presence of the latter on the appellant's premises during the carrying on of logging and loading operations.\nParagraph 3 provides not only that the trucks and their drivers shall be \"the responsibility\" of the truckers but also that they shall be at their \"risk.\" \"Risk\" certainly includes injury or damage occurring to the trucks or the drivers, while \"responsibility\" envisages accountability for damage caused by the trucks or drivers. In my view these words are used in contradistinction with the result that damage to trucks and personnel as well as damage by them is expressly provided for.\nWith respect to protection against claims for third party damage, such a result is attained by the following language, namely, that \"the trucks and the personnel operating such trucks shall at all times be\u2026 the responsibility of the truckers\" who agree to \"indemnify and save harmless the Company\u2026 for any damages that may occur arising out of the use or operation of the said trucks.\"\nThis, however, as already noted, does not exhaust the actual terms of paragraph 3 as it also provides that the trucks and the drivers shall at all times \"be at the risk\" of the truckers who shall also \"provide their own insurance\", (no doubt insurance as to the trucks themselves) and \"pay their own Workmen's Compensation charges\" (insurance as to the drivers) and \"indemnify and save harmless the Company from any claims or damage.\"\nWith respect to the obligation to insure, it is, I think, obvious, as was pointed out by Banks L.J., in Rutter v. Palmer[4] , that\nit is well known to be the common practice for the owners of motorcars to insure themselves against all risks in connection with the car, that is to say against damage done not only to the car but by the car, and damage caused not only by negligent acts but by innocent acts as well.\nIn Canada Steamship Lines v. The King[5] , with respect to a provision there in question that the respondents would \"provide their own insurance,\" Lord Morton, speaking for the Judicial Committee, said at p. 211 that the other party to the contract had indicated by that language that it did not intend to be liable for any damage to the property there in question \"howsoever such damage might arise.\"\nIn my view the contention of the respondent gives effect to part only of the terms of paragraph 3. I think, with respect, it cannot be so limited, and that effect can be given to all of its language only by construing it as covering damage or injury to trucks or drivers caused by the negligence of the appellant as well as damage to the person or property of third persons caused by reason of the operation of the trucks. The appellant would not be liable for any damage or injury to trucks or drivers caused otherwise than by negligence on the part of its servants.\nWith respect also, I cannot accept the contention that the damage here in question arose outside the scope of the contract and, therefore, outside the protection of paragraph 3. The words \"at all times\" sufficiently indicate that an occasion, such as that here in question when the truck was waiting to be loaded, was, in the contemplation of the parties, an occasion within the express terms of the contract.\nI would allow the appeal. The appellant should have its costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Estey and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014 The facts out of which this appeal arises are undisputed. On March 5, 1948, the appellant and the respondents entered into a contract in which they are referred to respectively as \"the Company\" and \"the Truckers\". The relevant parts of this contract are as follows:\u2014\nWHEREAS the Company owns and has the right to log Timber Licences 3233p, 3234p, and 6420p, together with certain adjoining Crown Timber Sales situate in the vicinity of Elk Creek, in the District of Sayward, Vancouver Island, Province of British Columbia, with a log pond adjacent thereto, with dumping facilities (hereinafter referred to as the \"Log Dump\");\nAND WHEREAS the Truckers are desirous of transporting the log production from the said timber lands to the Company's said Log Dump and have agreed with the Company to haul all logs produced by the Company from the area within three and one-half miles of the said Log Dump as shown on the sketch attached hereto, which area is hereinafter referred to as the \"Logging Area\", and to perform the additional services hereinafter set out for the remuneration and on the terms and conditions hereinafter contained;\nNOW THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH:\n1. During the life of the within contract IT IS AGREED that the Truckers shall have the exclusive right at the remuneration and on the terms and conditions hereinafter set out, to haul all logs produced by the Company from its said logging area.\n2. The Truckers HEREBY COVENANT with the Company as follows:\n(a) The Truckers shall furnish sufficient logging trucks, which in the opinion of the Company are necessary to haul all of the logs produced from the said logging area, and will at all times during the life of the within contract at the Trucker's expense, maintain and keep the said logging trucks in first-class operating condition;\n(b) The truck or trucks to be provided by the Truckers shall, at all times during the life of the within contract, be kept in readiness and available for the purpose of hauling logs produced by the Company pursuant to the terms of this contract and that the time of loading and the despatch of the trucks for the purpose of efficiently transporting the said logs shall be at the sole discretion and control of the Company;\n(c) The driver of each truck shall be a competent and qualified logging truck driver approved by and acceptable to the Company. 3. IT IS UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED that the trucks and the personnel operating such trucks shall, at all times during the life of the within contract, be at the risk of and the responsibility of the Truckers and that the Truckers will provide their own insurance, pay their own Workmen's Compensation charges and will indemnify and save harmless the Company from any claims or damage or for any damage that may occur arising out of the use or operation of the said trucks for the term of the within contract.\nParagraph 4 deals with the terms of payment. The contract continues:\n5. IT IS UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED that the Truckers shall haul all logs produced under the within contract to the said log dump and will, with the equipment to be provided by the Company and with the assistance of the Company's log dump employees, cause the said logs to be dumped at the Company's said log dump.\n6. IT IS UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED that to facilitate the maintenance and repair of the Trucker's trucking equipment that the Truckers may use the Company's temporary garage for the purpose of making repairs and carrying out maintenance and service work on the said trucks and trailers free of charge, but that any gasoline, oils, grease, major parts or other major materials provided by the Company for such maintenance and service work shall be paid for by the Truckers at cost, and IT IS FURTHER UNDERSTOOD that the intention is that the Company shall provide the facilities in this clause referred to to assist the Truckers in maintaining the truck and trailers to be provided by the Truckers in operating conditions and that it is not intended that the Company shall in any wise be expected to provide parts or materials for overhaul.\n7. IT IS UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED that the Company shall, with the use of its road grader, so far as possible keep its logging truck roads in the said logging area, and particularly the main line logging truck road, in as good shape as reasonably possible for the hauling of the said logs, subject to circumstances or conditions arising beyond the control of the Company.\n8. IT IS UNDERSTOOD that the Company will furnish suitable water facilities for the purpose of cooling brakes when required and will for the purpose of enabling the Truckers to furnish light for the said temporary garage, furnish the Truckers with one of its existing gasoline light plants which it is understood the Truckers will maintain and operate for the purpose of furnishing light for the said temporary garage.\n9. In order to facilitate the carrying on of continuous logging and to, so far as possible, prevent shutdowns the Truckers AGREE with the Company that they will provide without charge their equipment for the purpose of moving necessary miscellaneous equipment from one setting or logging area to another setting or logging area. Paragraph 10 deals with terms of payment.\n11. IT IS UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED that it is the intention of the Company to carry on continuous operations except for necessary seasonable shutdowns and that the Company will use its best endeavours to provide a continuous supply of logs for hauling by the Truckers but that the quantity of timber and the time of the removal thereof and the right to shutdown operations at any time and for any cause shall be solely a matter of decision by the Company and the Company shall not under any circumstances by reason of a shutdown or its inability to make logs available for transport to its said log dump be in anywise responsible to the Truckers for any claim for damages or otherwise.\nIt was not suggested that any other provision of the contract was material to the question before us.\nOn June 22, 1949, a logging truck belonging to the respondents was standing near to a spar-tree of the appellant which was used for the two purposes of yarding (i.e. drawing in by the use of tackle rigged to the spar-tree) logs and of loading them on to the trucks. Both the yarding and the loading were done by employees of the appellant. These operations were separate and were performed with, different tackle and by different crews. While the truck was being loaded the appellant's yarding crew were engaged in yarding a log. This log hit and broke a \"snag\" which fell against and broke one of the guy-wires supporting the spar-tree, with the result that the spar-tree broke and fell on the truck damaging it to the extent of $5,549.29, for which amount the respondents brought action against the appellant. The action was tried before the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[6] , who found that the damage was caused by the negligence of the servants of the appellant. This finding was not questioned in the Court of Appeal[7] or before us. The learned Chief Justice held that the appellant was not relieved from liability by the terms of paragraph 3 of the contract quoted above because, in his view, the operation in the course of which the truck was negligently damaged was not within the contract and consequently the following words of Lord Greene M.R. in Alderslade v. Hendon Laundry Ld.[8] were applicable:\u2014\nIt must be remembered that a limitation clause of this kind only applies where the damage, in respect of which the limitation clause is operative, takes place within the four corners of the contract. On this point Sidney Smith J.A., with whom O'Halloran J.A. agreed, held a contrary opinion which he expressed in the following words:\u2014\nI think this too strict a view. I think it was based on his finding that the spar tree had nothing to do with the operation of loading the truck. But the evidence shows (and both counsel agree) that it had; that the same spar tree was used for yarding the logs (and it was in the yarding that negligence was found) and for loading them on to the truck. That being so, and the truck at the time being in the course of being loaded, it would seem that the damage was done while the truck was being used entirely in accordance with the contract terms, and in the very heart of the logging operations.\nIt is true that the words used by the learned Chief Justice who presided at the trial are open to the construction that he had overlooked the fact that the spar-tree was used in the operation of loading the trucks as well as in the operation of yarding the logs but, if this be so, in my opinion it in no way affects the validity of his conclusion. The negligent operation which caused the spar-tree to break had nothing to do with the operation of loading the truck. The reciprocal obligations with which the contract deals have to do with the loading of the logs on the respondent's trucks, the hauling of them to the appellant's log dump, and the dumping of them there. The contract is silent as to how the logs are to be brought to the places at which they are loaded. The appellant is left free to do this in any manner it sees fit or to arrange with an indepedent contractor to do it. Even if the words of the exempting clause should on a proper construction be held to apply to negligence of the appellant or its servants in regard to all matters falling within the four corners of the contract, I think that clear words would be necessary to extend it to cover damage caused by the negligence of its servants in a separate operation carried on by a different crew, and which, as has already been pointed out, the appellant was free to entrust to an independent contractor. Such operation does not in my opinion fall within the four corners of the contract merely by reason of the fact that it was being carried on in the immediate vicinity of the truck at the time it was being loaded. I am in respectful agreement with the conclusion of the learned Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia on this branch of the matter, without finding it necessary to resort to the rule stated in Beal's Cardinal Rules of Legal Interpretation, 3rd Edition at page 144 that:\u2014\nWhere there is any doubt as to the interpretation of any stipulation in a contract, it ought to be interpreted strictly against the party in whose favour it has been made.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

The appellant tendered the bonus payment and at the same time submitted for the signature of the respondent a form of lease containing provisions contrary to the terms of the option. The tender was refused. The trial judge found the option to be binding but the Court of Appeal for Alberta held that the tender was conditional and that the option had ceased to exist.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. The evidence showed that the tender was not within the terms of the option.\nPer: Kerwin and Fauteux JJ. The principles of Pierce v.

W. Riley Q.C. and J. R. McColough for the appellant.\nM. E. Shannon for the respondent. The judgment of Kerwin and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J. :\u2014This action is concerned with what is called an \"option to lease\", signed by Mrs. Connors, and is in these terms:\u2014\nOPTION TO LEASE\nTHIS INDENTURE made this 22nd day of October, A.D. 1951 BETWEEN\nAdda Weis Connors of Rimbey, Province of Alberta, Canada, hereinafter called the Lessor,\nand\nR. A. Gordon of Lacombe, Province of Alberta, hereinafter called the Lessee.\nThe Lessor being the registered owner of the S.W. 23-42-3 W 5M and also being in possession of the mines and mineral rights does on this day grant an option to R. A. Gordon, the Lessee, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this Option, the right to lease the mines and minerals on the above mentioned land, for a period of ten (10) years at the rate of One (1) Dollars per acre per year. It is also agreed that the Lessee will pay Sixteen Hundred ($1,600.00) bonus which includes the lease fee for one year.\nNow it is understood by both parties that for the sum of One Hundred ($100.00) Dollars paid by the Lessee to the Lessor, the Lessor agrees to give the Lessee Thirty (30) days to complete the payment of Sixteen Hundred ($1,600.00) Dollars agreed upon and in case the Lessee completes and takes up the option it is understood that the One Hundred ($100.00) Dollars now paid will be credited on the Sixteen Hundred ($1,600.00) payment. In case the payment of Fifteen Hundred ($1,500.00) is completed.\nThe Lessor and Lessee covenant and agree as follows: The Lessee shall pay to the Lessor as royalty (a) 12\u00bd per cent of the current market value at the well of all petroleum oil produced, saved and marketed from the said lands, (b) 12\u00bd per cent of the current market value of gas produced from the said lands and marketed or used off the said lands or in the manufacture of casinghead gasoline.\nIn witness whereof the Lessor and Lessee have signed their names this 22 day of October, A.D. 1951.\nIn Pierce v. Empey 2, with reference to an option for a sale of land, Sir Lyman Duff on behalf of the Court stated the law in the following terms at page 252:\u2014\nIt is well settled that a plaintiff invoking the aid of the court for the enforcement of an option for the sale of land must show that the terms of the option as to time and otherwise have been strictly observed. The owner incurs no obligation to sell unless the conditions precedent are fulfilled or, as the result of his conduct, the holder of the option is on some equitable ground relieved from the strict fulfilment of them (Cushing v. Knight (1912) 46 Can. S.C.R. 555; Hughes v. Metropolitan Rly. Co. (1877) 2 App. Cas. 439; Bruner v. Moore (1904) 1 Ch. 305.\nThe same principles apply to an option for a lease.\nIn the reasons for judgment of the Appellate Division 3, delivered on behalf of that Court by Mr. Justice Clinton J. Ford, appears the following :\nThe position taken by the plaintiff at the trial was that Mrs. Connors agreed to sign a lease in the form and content of what is spoken of in the case as a Landmen's lease, that was being used in the Rimbey area in the leasing of petroleum and natural gas rights.\nThis is made plain by the statement of counsel for the appellant at the opening of the trial:\u2014 \"As I see it the main issue in the case is whether the lease should be for ten years or for ten years and longer thereafter as oil is produced.\" That this position was justified is shown by the evidence given on cross-examination by Mr. MacGillivray, the agent of the appellant, who in response to the following question:\u2014 \"You wanted her to take the money first before you would discuss the lease with her, is that it?\",\u2014referring to the interview on November 9 or 10 between Mrs. Connors and Mr. MacGillivray,\u2014answered by a decisive \"No.\" It is true that the witness proceeded to state:\u2014 \"I wanted her to accept the money, say she would accept it and then we would go into the lease\" but that does not qualify the emphatic negative and in fact it shows that the witness was merely following the instructions he had received from the appellant who testified that he had told Mr. MacGillivray:\u2014 \"Pay Mrs. Connors the $1,500.00 and have her sign the lease.\" The lease followed in substance the Landmen's form that was being used in the Rimbey area and instead of being a lease for ten years, it was for \"ten years or so long thereafter as the leased substances were produced.\" It also contained other provisions contrary to the terms of the option.\nIt is of importance that on November 20 (before the expiration of the thirty days mentioned in the option) Mr. Braithwaite, Mrs. Connors' son-in-law, offered Mr. MacGillivray a ten year lease and repeated the offer the follow- ing day to the appellant. Part of the appellant's cross-examination upon this point and as to that conversation is as follows:\u2014\nQ. And do you recall Mr. Braithwaite telling you at that time that any lease they submitted to you would be for ten years certain, nothing more, nothing less, in accordance with the option?\u2014A. I do not. But I do recall him saying that he understood that they were bound to give a lease for ten years. Yes?\u2014A. And that they were prepared to execute a lease of that type.\nGiving full effect to the trial judge's finding:\u2014 \"I accept the evidence of B. M. MacGillivray throughout respecting the transactions between the parties.\", it is clear that in accordance with his instructions, Mr. MacGillivray would not have paid the $1,500 to Mrs. Connors without having the latter sign the form of lease sent to him by the appellant. The Appellate Division came to the right conclusion and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRand J.:\u2014Throughout these proceedings both parties have agreed and acted on the view that, by its terms, the option was to be accepted by the unconditional tender to the respondent of the sum of $1,500. The evidence indicates clearly that no such tender was made. That of the agent representing the appellant shows beyond a doubt his intention, after demonstrating, as he did, that the money was there and available to be paid over, to proceed first to settle the terms of a lease which both parties assumed would be drawn up. The document presented at that time contained clauses that contradicted the provisions of the option, and the respondent was justified in rejecting it. But quite apart from that, at no time within the period of the option was the appellant or his agent willing to pay the money over as the act of acceptance and therefore antecedent to the formulation of terms. There was, then, no acceptance of the offer of sale, and consequently no contract, and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nEstey, J.:\u2014The appellant and Adda Weis Connors in her lifetime entered into an option agreement dated October 22, 1951, which reads as follows:\nThe Lessor being the registered owner of the S.W. 23-42-3 W. 5M and also being in possession of the mines and mineral rights does on this day grant an option to R. A. Gordon, the Lessee, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this Option, the right to lease the mines and minerals on the above mentioned land, for a period of ten (10) years at the rate of One (1) Dollar per acre per year. It is also agreed that the Lessee will pay Sixteen Hundred ($1,600.00) bonus which includes the lease fee for one year.\nNow it is understood by both parties that for the sum of One Hundred ($100.00) Dollars paid by the Lessee to the Lessor, the Lessor agrees to give the Lesse Thirty (30) days to complete the payment of Sixteen Hundred ($1,600.00) Dollars agreed upon and in case the Lessee completes and takes up the option it is undertsood that the One Hundred ($100.00) Dollars now paid will be credited on the Sixteen Hundred ($1,600.00) payment. In case the payment of Fifteen Hundred ($1,500.00) is completed the Lessor and Lessee covenant and agree as follows:\nThe Lessee shall pay to the Lessor as royalty (a) 12\u00bd per cent of the current market value at the well of all petroleum oil produced, saved and marketed from the said lands.\n(b) 12\u00bd per cent of the current market value of gas produced from the said lands and marketed or used off the said lands or in the manufacture of casinghead gasoline.\nThe appellant contends that through his agent, MacGillivray, on the 9th or 10th day of November, 1951, he accepted the option by tendering the sum of $1,500, which Mrs. Connors refused. The respondent contends that it was but a conditional offer. The learned trial judge found in favour of the appellant and declared that the appellant was entitled to a lease in the terms of the above-quoted option, read in conjunction with the terms of the Alberta Landmen's Association form of lease, on payment by the plaintiff of $1,500.00.\nThe learned judges in the Court of Appeal 4 held that the Landmen's lease was not a part of the option and that the tender on the 9th or 10th of November by MacGillivray of $1,500 was conditional.\nI am in agreement with the learned judges in the Court of Appeal that the Landmen's lease was not a part of the option.\nThe evidence justifies a conclusion that early in November the appellant had made up his mind to accept the option, provided he could obtain a lease upon the terms that he desired, which were not those of the lease contemplated by the option. He sent the $1,500 and a draft lease to his agent, MacGillivray, with instructions: \"Pay Mrs. Connors the $1,500 and have her sign the lease.\" MacGillivray advised Mrs. Connors that he had the $1,500 and the lease. As a consequence she went to his office and, after some conversation to the effect that she preferred to be released from the option and Mr. MacGillivray's statement that he could do nothing about it, he continued: \"I am instructed to tender you $1,500, and here is the money in cash.\" The evidence shows clearly that he did no more than show her the money. When asked : \"You wanted her to take the money first before you would discuss the lease with her, is that it?\" he replied: \"No. I wanted her to accept the money, say she would accept it, and then we would go into the lease.\"\nThe lease prepared by the appellant and sent to MacGillivray included clauses contrary to the terms of the option. The two to which particular objections were taken provided for a right in the lessee to surrender at any time and that it should \"remain in force for ten years from this date and so long thereafter as the leased substances, or any of them are produced from the said land or any operations are conducted thereon for the discovery and\/or recovery of leased substances.\"\nThe learned trial judge accepted the evidence of MacGillivray \"throughout respecting the transactions between the parties.\" MacGillivray arranged for a meeting at his office on November 21, when the appellant, MacGillivray, Mrs. Connors and Mr. and Mrs. Braithwaite were present. Notwithstanding that the appellant then had in his possession a letter written by Mrs. Connors' solicitor taking exception to certain clauses, including the two above mentioned, he brought a second draft lease to the meeting which contained both of these objectionable clauses. Braithwaite, who was acting as agent for Mrs. Connors, deposed that he, upon that occasion, offered appellant a lease for a ten-year period, which he refused in the words \"It is no good to me.\" The appellants, while not expressly admitting Braithwaite's statement, did admit that Braithwaite had offered him a lease in the terms of the option, to which he replied: \"I did tell him at the time that I did not think such a lease would be worth very much, but I should certainly like it prepared and submitted to me for my inspection.\" He was then asked and replied:\nQ. \u2026 But your option is for 10 years, is it not?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. All right.\u2026And what did you want the term to be in the lease?\u2014\nA. Ten years or so long thereafter as the leased substances were produced. Moreover, at the trial one of the main issues was whether or not the form of lease known as the Alberta Landmen's Association lease was not a part of the option agreement and, in fact, the learned trial judge directed that it be declared\nthat the plaintiff is entitled to a Petroleum and Natural Gas lease of S.W. 23-42-3, W. 5th, in the terms of the agreement between the parties dated 22nd October, 1951, read in conjunction with the terms of the Alberta Landmen's Association form of lease on payment by the plaintiff of $1,500.00.\nThis Landmen's lease contained clauses providing for continuation and surrender to the same effect as those objected to by the respondent.\nThe foregoing indicates that the appellant was at all times insisting upon a lease for ten years and so long thereafter as the leased substances were produced, and, therefore, quite contrary to the terms of the option, which provided for a period of ten years certain. It was (this he desired and insisted upon throughout. It was in the first lease that he sent to his agent, MacGillivray, with the instructions: \"Pay Mrs. Connors the $1,500 and have her sign the lease.\" That MacGillivray understood and was but carrying out his principal's instructions is clear from the language \"I wanted her to \u2026 say she would accept it, and then we would go into the lease.\" This leads to the conclusion that had she failed to sign the lease he would have retained the $1,500. It cannot, therefore, be construed as more than a conditional tender.\nCounsel for the appellant emphasized a portion of his client's evidence as to what took place in MacGillivray's office on November 21 when all were present. This evidence reads as follows:\nI advised Mr. Braithwaite that my information was that \u00a71,500.00 had been tendered to Mrs. Connors, and that I was prepared to go over to the bank and obtain another $1,500.00 if she desired tender to be made, and he advised that there was no necessity of making tender, because they admitted tender had been made to Mrs. Connors.\nThe appellant does not purport to give Braithwaite's words, but rather his own conclusion as to the effect thereof. Braithwaite was not asked as to this part of the conversation, nor was it referred to by MacGillivray. Even upon the assumption that the appellant's recollection and conclusion as to the admission is correct, it could not amount to more than that a tender had, in fact, been made to MacGillivray. It still remained for the Court to determine, as a matter of law, whether the tender was absolute or conditional.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nLocke, J. :\u2014The document signed by Mrs. Connors called an \"option to lease\" described the land, the term of the lease, the annual rental and the royalty to be paid to the lessor in the event of oil or gas being discovered, the payment by Gordon of the sum of $100 was acknowledged and the offer to lease the mineral rights was stated to be open for acceptance for a period of thirty days from October 22, 1951. Upon acceptance and the payment of a further $1,500 before the expiration of that period without more, the transaction would have been completed. The offer thus made said nothing about any more formal lease and did not, by its terms, obligate Mrs. Connors to sign any other document.\nThe appellant in framing his action, after referring to the written document, said that \"the lease to be granted on the exercising of the option\" was for a term certain which was stated in the language of the option and, after alleging a tender, pleaded that:\u2014\nThe Defendant further refused to grant the plaintiff a lease of the said mines and minerals in direct violation of the terms and covenants in the said agreement.\nBy the defence it was alleged that the plaintiff had failed to tender the sum of $1,500 within the time limited by the option and, alternatively, that if any such tender was made the plaintiff had required the defendant, at the time of the tender, to sign a lease which did not comply with the terms of the option and which contained terms and covenants not provided for or contemplated in the said option.\nIt was upon this record that the action went to trial. The opening statement of counsel for the plaintiff, however, made it clear that the issue which the plaintiff contended was to be tried was not one which was raised by the pleadings, as he then said that the main issue in the case was whether the lease should be for ten years or for ten years and so long thereafter as oil was produced. No such question could arise under the terms of the written instrument. The appellant, however, apparently without objection, proceeded to set up another case which was that there had been negotiations between the parties prior to the signing of the option, which obligated Mrs. Connors, if the option was accepted, to sign a written lease in a form referred to in the evidence as the Landman's lease, which, it was said, is extensively used in leasing mineral rights in the Province of Alberta. Despite the state of the record and without any amendment, evidence was directed to this issue by both parties and the learned trial Judge found that the plaintiff was:\u2014\nentitled to a petroleum and natural gas lease of S.W. 23-42-3, W. 5th, in the terms of the agreement between the parties dated 22nd October, 1951 (Ex. 1), read in conjunction with the terms of the Alberta Landmen's Association form of lease (Ex. 3) on payment by the plaintiff of $1,500.\nA blank form of the Landmen's lease had been introduced by the plaintiff into the evidence. In addition to a large number of important terms which had never been discussed between the parties, the form fixed the duration of the lease as being for a term of years to be specified,\nand so long thereafter as the substances or any of them are being produced from the said lands subject to the sooner termination of the said term as hereinafter provided.\nA further provision gave to the lessee the right to surrender the lease at any time as to all or any portion of the lands, whereupon the obligations of the lessee should cease.\nIt was, no doubt, because the appellant had not in his statement of claim alleged that Mrs. Connors had orally agreed to lease the mineral rights for ten years upon the terms and conditions stipulated for in the Landmen's lease form that the Statute of Frauds was not raised as a defence. Clinton J. Ford, J.A. 5, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, has said that, if it were necessary, permission to amend to plead the statute should be granted but considered that the defence was open to the present respondent without this being done. On the view I take of this matter, it is unnecessary to consider the question.\nThe action is one for specific performance. If the issue to be disposed of is that raised by the pleadings, it is perfectly clear that Mrs. Connors did not by the terms of the option agree to sign any further written instrument and the action fails since the evidence shows that there was no unconditional tender of the sum of $1,500 during the period within which the offer was open for acceptance but that, on the contrary, the amount was offered to her on condition that she sign a lease, the terms of which differed radically from the terms of the offer. If, on the other hand, the matter be considered upon the evidence as to the negotiations between the parties, both prior to and after October 22, 1951, while it is apparent that Mrs. Connors, who had apparently very little business experience in matters of this nature, was prepared to sign a formal lease in the terms of the offer, there is no evidence that she agreed to sign such an instrument, either in the terms of the Landmen's lease or in either of the other forms which the appellant endeavoured to induce her to execute.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacLeod, Riley, McDermid, Bessemer & Dixon.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McLaws & McLaws.\n1 [1953] 2 D.L.R. 137; 8 W.W.R.

She was a partner in a meat business but testified that since 1930 she had, out of her savings, purchased from time to time a number of properties which she sold soon thereafter; that since 1940 she had capital gain in view in making these purchases. The terms of sale in most cases called for a small down-payment and for the balance in monthly instalments. She contended that these were capital profits but the assessment was upheld by the Exchequer Court of Canada. Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\nHeld: The number of transactions entered into by the appellant and, in some cases, the proximity of the purchase to the sale amounted to a carrying on of a \"business\" within the meaning of the Excess Profits Tax Act.\nHeld further: Nothing has been shown to indicate any error in the method of assessment adopted by the respondent.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Hyndman J.1, upholding the Minister's assessment.\nG. H. Steer Q.C. for the appellant.\nH. W. Riley Q.C. and F. J. Cross for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Estey and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.:\u2014In this appeal nothing turns upon the credibility of the appellant but having read the record since the argument, I am of opinion that the trial judge 2 came to the right conclusion. The principle to be applied is well settled and its application is exemplified in two decisions of this Court: Argue v. Minister of National Revenue 3, where the taxpayer succeeded, and Campbell v. Minister of National Revenue 4, where the taxpayer failed. It is a question of fact in each case.\nThe number of transactions entered into by the appellant and, in some cases, the proximity of the purchase to the sale of the property indicates that she was carrying on a business and not merely realizing or changing investments. The method of assessment adopted by the respondent is indicated in a letter to the appellant's auditors from the Director of Income Tax at Edmonton, and nothing has been shown in evidence or in argument to indicate any error in that method. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRand J.:\u2014The question raised in this appeal is simply whether, during the years in question, the series of transactions carried out by the appellant amounted to a carrying on of a \"business\" as that word is used in the Excess Profits Tax Act. Hyndman, Deputy Judge, proceeding on a sound appreciation of the considerations applicable to that determination, found that it did, and I am quite unable to say that, in reaching that conclusion, he was not amply supported by the facts disclosed.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nKellock J.:\u2014The sole question involved in this appeal is as to whether or not the profits here in question were derived from the carrying on by the appellant of a \"business\" within the meaning of the Excess Profits Tax Act. The learned trial judge 5, after a careful review of the evidence, concluded that they were so derived.\nDuring the years 1938 to 1945, the appellant carried out some fifty-three transactions of purchase and sale of real estate, to the carrying out of which she devoted all her time outside of that devoted to the meat business which she was carrying on in partnership. She testified that before buying any property she would probably inspect as many as thirty; that since 1940 she had capital gain in view in the making of her purchase; and that she improved some of these properties \"for purposes of sale.\" In a number of instances she had evidently arranged the sale before she consummated the purchase as sale followed immediately on the purchase.\nThe learned judge approached the question in issue from the standpoint of the principle laid down by Lord Justice Clerk in California Copper Syndicate v. Harris 6, approved by Lord Dunedin in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Commissioner of Taxes v. Melbourne Trust 7, and applied by Locke J., delivering the unanimous judgment of this court in Campbell v. Minister of National Revenue 8, as follows:\nIt is quite a well settled principle in dealing with questions of income tax that where the owner of an ordinary investment chooses to realize it, and obtains a greater price for it than he originally acquired it at, the enhanced price is not profit in the sense of Schedule D of the Income Tax Act of 1842 assessable to income tax. But it is equally well established that enhanced values obtained from realization or conversion of securities may be so assessable where what is done is not merely a realization or change of investment, but an act done in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying 'Out, of a business. In Cooper v. Stubbs 9, Atkin L.J., as he then was, in considering the question as to whether on the evidence in that case the appellant was carrying on a \"trade\" within the meaning of Schedule D of the Income Tax Act 1918, said at page,772:\nThere are no doubt laymen who do indulge in speculative purchases in these commodities, and they repeat those speculative purchases more than once, being probably buoyed up by their initial successes. Nevertheless, it seems to me still to be a question of fact whether the professional man, to quote an extreme case, who makes purchases of that kind, and makes more than one of them in the year, can be said to be engaged in a trade or vocation in the course of these purchases. I should think it would probably be a question of degree. Now if it is a question of degree, it must be a question of fact \u2026 Of course, in all these matters there may be a state of facts which can only lead to one conclusion of law, but when it is, as I have said, a question of degree, it seems to me it must necessarily be a question of fact.\nIn the case at bar the learned judge below concluded that the only reasonable inference from the evidence was that the appellant had followed a course or system which had in view not just investment but the intention to make profits by sale, and that in so doing she was engaged in the carrying on of a business. I think the learned judge has properly appreciated the facts and has properly directed himself with regard to the law and that his finding should not be disturbed.\nThe appellant relies upon the judgment of this court delivered by Locke J., in Argue v. The Minister of National Revenue 10, as assisting her position. In that case, however, Locke J., said at p. 477:\nI find nothing in the evidence in this case which, in my opinion, justifies the conclusion that the appellant \u2026 was trading in securities or buying and selling them with a view to profit.\nI think, therefore, this decision does not help the appellant.\nI concur also with the learned judge in the view that the appellant has not satisfied the onus of establishing any error in the method of assessment, and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Milner, Steer, Dyde, Poirier, Martland & Layton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

Appellant;\nand\nThe Labour Relations Board of Quebec Respondent.\nand\nThe Montreal Catholic School Commission Mis-En-Cause.\n1953: January 28, 29; 1953: June 8.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Rand, Estey and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nLabour\u2014School teachers on strike\u2014Revocation of certificate of representation\u2014Union not notified of hearing of Labour Board\u2014Whether writ of prohibition proper remedy\u2014Judicial function of Board\u2014Whether revocation null\u2014Public Services Employees Disputes Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 169\u2014Labour Relations Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 162A\u2014Public Inquiry Commission Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 9\u2014Articles 60, 82, 1003 C.P.\nThe appellant called a strike of its members in violation of the Public Services Employees Disputes Act (R.S.Q. 1941, c. 169), which forbids such action from the employees of a school corporation. Thereupon, the respondent, acting ex parte and without notice to the appellant, invoked s. 41 of the Labour Relations Act (R.S.Q. 1941, c. 162A) and cancelled the appellant's certificate of representation. A writ of prohibition taken by the appellant and in which it asked for a declaration of nullity, was maintained by the Superior Court and rejected by the Court of Appeal for Quebec.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed; the respondent acted without jurisdiction and the revocation of the appellant's certificate of representation was null and of no effect.\nPer Rinfret C.J.: Having acted as a judicial tribunal, the Board must be assimilated to a court of inferior jurisdiction within the meaning of s. 1003 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and was therefore subjected to the writ of prohibition. The Board acted without jurisdiction and the writ of prohibition was the proper remedy to prevent the execution of its decision.\nAn express declaration from the legislator is required to prevent the application of the principle that no person can be condemned or deprived of his rights without being heard.\nS. 17 of the Public Inquiry Commission Act (R.S.Q. 1941, c. 9) does not apply to the Board and cannot be invoked to prevent the prohibition against a decision rendered without jurisdiction.\nPer. Kerwin and Estey JJ.: Notwithstanding that s. 41 of the Labour Act does not in terms require it and notwithstanding s. 50 of that Act, the respondent was bound to give notice to the appellant before cancelling its certificate, even though an illegal strike had been called. The appellant was entitled to a declaration of nullity and was authorized to join a claim for such relief to a demand for prohibition. Per Rand J.: The provisions of the Labour Relations Act are incompatible with authority to revoke the certificate solely on the ground that there had been a violation of a penal provision of the statute.\nAlthough an administrative body, the Board in making decisions of a judicial nature, as it did here, was bound by the maxim Audi Alteram Partem.\nProhibition would be futile in the present case since the Board's action was exhausted by the revocation, but the proceeding can still be maintained for there is nothing in the articles of the Code of Civil Procedure against the maintenance of the finding, necessarily involved in such a proceeding, that the act challenged was beyond the jurisdiction of the Board.\nPer Fauteux J.: In revoking the certificate of the appellant, the Board acted as a judicial tribunal and therefore should have heard the appellant or at least given him the opportunity to be heard. The application of the principle Audi Alteram. Partem is implied in the statutes giving judicial powers to administrative bodies and to suspend its application an explicit text or equivalent inference must be found in the statute. There is here no such text nor does a comparison of s. 41 of the Labour Act with s. 50 justify the inference that the legislator clearly intended to make an exception.\nSince there is nothing incompatible in the joining of a claim of nullity for lack of jurisdiction to a request for prohibition, the appellant is entitled to an adjudication on the question of nullity, even on the assumption that prohibition was not the proper remedy.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, reversing the trial judge and quashing a writ of prohibition.\nL. P. Pigeon Q.C. for the appellant.\nL. E. Beaulieu Q.C. and J. Gingras Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014L'Alliance des Professeurs catholiques de Montr\u00e9al porte un appel d'un jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine 2 en date du 5 octobre 1951, \u00e0 raison duquel un jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, rendu le 23 septembre 1950, fut infirm\u00e9 et le bref de prohibition \u00e9mis \u00e0 la demande de l'appelante contre les intim\u00e9es fut annul\u00e9 et l'action rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nL'objet de l'appel est un ordre de la Commission des Relations ouvri\u00e8res de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e9mis ex parte, le 21 janvier 1949, ayant pour r\u00e9sultat de r\u00e9voquer, \u00e0 toute fin que de droit, le certificat de reconnaissance syndicale, \u00e9mis le 12 mai 1944, en faveur de l'Alliance des Professeurs catholiques de Montr\u00e9al, comme agent n\u00e9gociateur de tous les instituteurs et institutrices qui enseignent en fran\u00e7cais dans les \u00e9coles fran\u00e7aises de la Commission des Ecoles catholiques de Montreal.\nL'appelante est une association incorpor\u00e9e en mars 1944, en vertu de la Loi des syndicats professionnels (S.R.Q. 1941, c. 162).\nLe 12 mai 1944, la Commission des Relations ouvri\u00e8res de la province de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e9mit, en faveur de cette association, un certificat de reconnaissance pour repr\u00e9senter tous les instituteurs et institutrices qui enseignent en fran\u00e7ais dans les \u00e9coles fran\u00e7aises de la Commisison scolaire catholique de Montreal, comme agent n\u00e9gociateur avec cette Commission, le tout conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi des diff\u00e9rends entre les services publics et leurs salari\u00e9s (S.R.Q. 1941, c. 169) et la Loi des relations ouvri\u00e8res (S.R.Q. 1941, c. 162A).\nEn janvier 1949, l'Alliance et la Commisison des Ecoles catholiques de Montreal n'avaient pas encore r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 conclure une convention collective concernant les salaires des instituteurs pour l'ann\u00e9e courante. A une r\u00e9union g\u00e9n\u00e9rale tenue le 12 janvier, la majorit\u00e9 des membres pr\u00e9sents de l'Alliance se pronon\u00e7a en faveur d'une gr\u00e8ve qui devait commencer le lundi 17 Janvier. Effectivement cette gr\u00e8ve se d\u00e9clencha \u00e0 la date fix\u00e9e, bien que, \u00e0 la fin de la semaine, les instituteurs d\u00e9cid\u00e8rent de retourner \u00e0 leur travail; ce qu'ils firent d\u00e8s le lundi 24 janvier. Dans l'intervalle, \u00e0 savoir, le 21 janvier, la Commission des Ecoles catholiques de Montreal avait adress\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e demandant l'annulation du certificat de l'Alliance comme agent n\u00e9gociateur. Le m\u00eame jour (21 janvier), sans audition ni avis \u00e0 l'Alliance, l'intim\u00e9e rendit une d\u00e9cision annulant le certificat de l'Alliance. Cette d\u00e9cision fut transmise \u00e0 l'Alliance par t\u00e9l\u00e9gramme exp\u00e9di\u00e9 le m\u00eame jour par le secr\u00e9taire de l'intim\u00e9e et confirm\u00e9 par une lettre en date du jour suivant.\nLe 27 avril 1949, l'Alliance obtint d'un juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure un ordre autorisant l'\u00e9mission d'un bref de prohibition. La requ\u00eate de l'Alliance, qui accompagnait ce bref, all\u00e9guait que l'annulation du certificat de reconnaissance \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale, parce qu'une gr\u00e8ve n'\u00e9tait pas une raison justifiant cette annulation et parce que, en plus, l'Alliance n'avait re\u00e7u aucun avis de la demande d'annulation . La requ\u00eate concluait \u00e0 ce qu'il fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e avait exc\u00e9d\u00e9 sa juridiction en rendant la d\u00e9cision du 21 janvier et \u00e0 ce qu'en cons\u00e9quence cette d\u00e9cision fut adjug\u00e9e nulle et sans effet.\nL'action de l'Alliance fut d'abord rencontr\u00e9e par une exception \u00e0 la forme, qui fut rejet\u00e9e par jugement du 28 juin 1949. L'intim\u00e9e en appela de cette d\u00e9cision \u00e0 la Cour du Banc de la Reine et l'appel fut de nouveau rejet\u00e9 par jugement de cette Cour, en date du 8 f\u00e9vrier 1950.\nLa cause revint alors devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et, au m\u00e9rite, l'intim\u00e9e plaida que la d\u00e9cision dont l'Alliance se plaignait \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e par le fait que toute gr\u00e8ve \u00e9tait prohib\u00e9e par la Loi des diff\u00e9rends entre les services publics et leurs salari\u00e9s (S.R.Q. 1941, c. 169) et, en plus, que la Commission des Relations ouvri\u00e8res de la province de Qu\u00e9bec jouissait de l'immunit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'encontre d'un bref de prohibition.\nLe bref de prohibition fut n\u00e9anmoins maintenu par jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure du 23 septembre 1950 et la d\u00e9cision d'annulation de la part de l'intim\u00e9e fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle.\nSur appel, la Cour du Banc de la Reine 3 infirma ce jugement. Une majorit\u00e9 des juges (St-Germain, St-Jacques et Gagn\u00e9, JJ.) fut d'avis que la gr\u00e8ve des instituteurs \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale et qu'elle justifiait l'annulation du certificat \u00e9mis en faveur de l'Alliance; en plus, qu'un avis \u00e0 l'Alliance avant l'annulation du certificat n'\u00e9tait pas requis par la loi. Les deux autres juges (Barclay et Casey, JJ.) \u00e9mirent l'opinion que le bref de prohibition n'\u00e9tait pas le rem\u00e8de appropri\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce parce qu'apr\u00e8s que la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, il ne subsistait rien \u00e0 faire de plus de la part de l'intim\u00e9e avant que la d\u00e9cision de cette derni\u00e8re fut ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e.\nL'Alliance a port\u00e9 ce jugement en appel devant la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada et soumet que l'intim\u00e9e, en agissant sans avis \u00e0 l'Alliance, a exc\u00e9d\u00e9 sa juridiction; que, au surplus, une gr\u00e8ve, m\u00eame ill\u00e9gale, n'est pas une cause suffisante pour annuler un certificat de reconnaissance; et que, dans les circonstances, le bref de prohibition est le rem\u00e8de appropri\u00e9. Le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure commence par prendre \u00e9tat des faits suivants:\nLes intim\u00e9es admettent qu'aucune requ\u00eate en r\u00e9vocation de reconnaissance syndicale n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l'Alliance.\nL'Alliance n'a re\u00e7u aucun avis de la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9vocation et elle n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sente ni repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tendue s\u00e9ance \u00e0 laquelle l'intim\u00e9e a pris sur elle de rendre la d\u00e9cision r\u00e9voquant la reconnaissance ;\nLe 21 janvier 1949, l'intim\u00e9e a rendu une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9voquant le certificat de reconnaissance syndicale;\nCette d\u00e9cision fut port\u00e9e \u00e0 la connaissance de l'Alliance par une d\u00e9p\u00eache t\u00e9l\u00e9graphique du 21 janvier 1949, dat\u00e9e et sign\u00e9e \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec par le secr\u00e9taire de la Commission des Relations ouvri\u00e8res de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, M. Bernier;\nLe 22 janvier 1949, le secr\u00e9taire de la Commission a adress\u00e9 une copie de la d\u00e9cision au pr\u00e9sident de l'Alliance des Professeurs catholiques de Montreal, M. L\u00e9o Guindon. Cette lettre est dat\u00e9e de Qu\u00e9bec et sur la d\u00e9cision il est mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle fut \u00e9mise \u00e0 Quebec, le 21 janvier 1949.\nL'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance d\u00e9clare qu'il ne fait aucun doute qu'\u00e0 la date de la r\u00e9vocation l'Alliance \u00e9tait dans les conditions requises pour conserver le certificat de reconnaissance syndicale. A cette date, il y avait 1,620 instituteurs et institutrices qui enseignaient en fran\u00e7ais dans les \u00e9coles fran\u00e7aises de la Commission des Ecoles catholiques de Montreal et de ce nombre 1,509 \u00e9taient membres en r\u00e8gle de l'Alliance.\nL'honorable juge invoque l'article 1003 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile qui d\u00e9cr\u00e8te qu'il y a lieu au bref de prohibition lorsqu'un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur exc\u00e8de sa juridicition. En plus, l'article 50 du m\u00eame Code d\u00e9cr\u00e8te qu'\u00e0 l'exception de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, tous les tribunaux, juges de Circuit, magistrats et autres personnes, corps politiques et corporations, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, sont soumis au droit de surveillance et de r\u00e9forme, aux ordres et au contr\u00f4le de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et de ses juges, en la mani\u00e8re et la forme que prescrit la loi.\nDeux lois, d'apr\u00e8s la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, peuvent r\u00e9gir le pr\u00e9sent cas: La premi\u00e8re est la Loi des diff\u00e9rends entre les services publics et leurs salari\u00e9s (S.R.Q. 1941, c. 169) et l'autre est la Loi des relations ouvri\u00e8res (S.R.Q. 1941, c. 162A).\nLes dispositions de la Loi des relations ouvri\u00e8res s'appliquent aux services publics et aux salari\u00e9s, \u00e0 leurs employ\u00e9s mais, suivant la Loi des diff\u00e9rends entre les services publics et leurs salari\u00e9s, \"avec les modifications qui s'y trouvent et qui sont r\u00e9put\u00e9es en faire partie int\u00e9grante\". Les instituteurs sont des salari\u00e9s au sens de la loi (L'Association catholique des Instituteurs du District n\u00b0 16 v. Les Commissaires d'\u00e9coles pour la Municipalit\u00e9 de la Paroisse de St-Athanase 4).\nL'article 5 de la Loi des diff\u00e9rends entre les services publics et leurs salari\u00e9s d\u00e9fend la gr\u00e8ve en toute circonstance. Les articles 7 et 8 \u00e9dictent les peines pour les infractions, et l'article 11 ordonne qu'elles soient impos\u00e9es suivant la Loi des convictions sommaires.\nD'autre part, l'article 3 de la Loi des relations ouvri\u00e8res reconna\u00eet \u00e0 tout salari\u00e9 le droit d'\u00eatre membre d'une association et de prendre part \u00e0 ses activit\u00e9s l\u00e9gitimes. L'article 4 stipule que tout employeur est tenu de reconna\u00eetre, comme repr\u00e9sentant collectif des salari\u00e9s \u00e0 son emploi, une association groupant la majorit\u00e9 absolue des dits salari\u00e9s, et de n\u00e9gocier de bonne foi, avec eux, une convention collective de travail. Les articles 11 \u00e0 19 pr\u00e9voient la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour la n\u00e9gociation des conventions collectives, et les articles 20 \u00e0 28 d\u00e9finissent les pratiques interdites. Les articles 29 et suivants traitent de la formation de la Commission des Relations ouvri\u00e8res de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et r\u00e8glent son fonctionnement. Cette Commission a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e en corporation par cette loi sp\u00e9ciale et c'est uniquement dans cette loi qu'on doit trouver les pouvoirs qui lui sont attribu\u00e9s. L'article 41 permet \u00e0 la Commission, pour cause, de reviser ou r\u00e9voquer toute d\u00e9cision et tout ordre rendus par elle et tout certificat qu'elle a \u00e9mis. Les articles 42 \u00e0 47 d\u00e9finissent les peines impos\u00e9es \u00e0 ceux qui contreviennent \u00e0 cette loi; et l'article 48 ordonne qu'elles soient impos\u00e9es sur poursuite sommaire, suivant la Loi des convictions.\nEn rapport avec les infractions, les seuls pouvoirs attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 la Commisison des Relations ouvri\u00e8res sont d\u00e9finis aux articles 49 \u00e0 50.\nL'article 49 pr\u00e9voit qu'aucune poursuite p\u00e9nale ne peut \u00eatre intent\u00e9e en vertu de la loi sans l'autorisation \u00e9crite de la Commission ou le consentement du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. L'article 50 donne certains pouvoirs \u00e0 la Commission des Relations ouvri\u00e8res: Dans le cas d'infractions \u00e0 la section des pratiques interdites, elle peut, sans pr\u00e9judice de toute autre peine, prononcer la dissolution de l'association, mais \"apr\u00e8s lui avoir donn\u00e9 l'occasion d'\u00eatre entendue et de faire toute la preuve tendant \u00e0 se disculper\".\nAux termes de l'article 41, la Commission ne peut r\u00e9voquer une d\u00e9cision que \"pour cause\". D'apr\u00e8s le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, cette cause de r\u00e9vocation doit n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre une cause suffisante en droit. Il est d'avis que le pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par l'article 41 doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 strictement en conformit\u00e9 avec les termes de la loi et que toute d\u00e9cision qui n'est pas ainsi prise doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e en Cour de justice comme ill\u00e9gale (Wrights' Canadian Ropes Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue 5, d\u00e9cision du Conseil Priv\u00e9 6). 1946, S.C.R., \u00e0 la page 146:\nOf course, the discretion must be exercised on proper legal principles.\nA la page 156:\nThe Court is warranted in interfering with the exercise of the Minister's discretion if such discretion has not been exercised in accordance with sound and fundamental principles (Pioneer Laundry and Dry Cleaners Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, 1939 S.C.R. p. 1; 1940 A.C. p. 127; The King v. Noxzema Chemical Co. of Canada Ltd., 1942 S.C.R. p. 178).\nL'honorable juge \u00e9met ensuite l'avis que, quand un organisme gouvernemental exerce une discr\u00e9tion bas\u00e9e sur des motifs erron\u00e9s en droit et que sa d\u00e9cision n'est pas susceptible d'appel, il y a ouverture au bref de prohibition. (The Queen v. The Vestry of St. Pancras 7).\nL'honorable juge continue:\nLes articles 50 et 1003 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure civile nous viennent du droit anglais, et les autorit\u00e9s anglaises font autorit\u00e9 en la mati\u00e8re.\nCes articles ont pour but de contraindre les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs et les corps publics \u00e0 exercer leurs pouvoirs d'apr\u00e8s les principes fondamentaux du droit (Minister of National Revenue v. Wrights' Canadian Ropes Ltd., 1947 A.C. p. 109 \u00e0 122).\nIl en conclut donc que la Commission intim\u00e9e n'avait pas le droit de prononcer la dissolution de l'Alliance sans lui avoir, au pr\u00e9alable, donner l'occasion d'\u00eatre entendue et de faire toute preuve tendant \u00e0 se disculper.\nMais, toujours en suivant le jugement du tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance, il y a en cette esp\u00e8ce beaucoup plus que le d\u00e9faut d'entendre l'Alliance, au pr\u00e9alable, et de lui donner l'occasion de faire toute preuve tendant \u00e0 se disculper; il ressort de la preuve que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue avant qu'elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement saisie de la question. En effet, comme le fait remarquer le juge, la requ\u00eate de la Commission des \u00c9coles catholiques de Montreal est en date du 21 janvier 1949. Elle fut pr\u00e9par\u00e9e \u00e0 Montreal, \u00e0 la suite d'une r\u00e9union des commissaires des \u00e9coles catholiques de Montreal; or, c'est le m\u00eame jour que la Commisison intim\u00e9e, si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec,,' accordait cette requ\u00eate, alors qu'il est en preuve que ce n'est que le 24 janvier 1949 que cette derni\u00e8re est parvenue au bureau de la Commission des Relations ouvri\u00e8res de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec.\nIl en r\u00e9sulte que cette requ\u00eate aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par la Commission intim\u00e9e avant m\u00eame de l'avoir re\u00e7ue. Puis, cette d\u00e9cision annulant le certificat de reconnaissance fut communiqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l'Alliance par t\u00e9l\u00e9graphe.\nVoil\u00e0 une justice exp\u00e9ditive, s'il en est une: Le jugement rendu avant que la requ\u00eate fut devant la Commission intim\u00e9e et la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e inform\u00e9e par t\u00e9l\u00e9gramme; aucune signification \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re de la requ\u00eate de la Commission des Ecoles catholiques de Montreal, aucun avis et aucune audition des moyens que l'Alliance pouvait opposer \u00e0 la demande de la Commission des \u00c9coles catholiques de Montreal.\nIl est difficile de qualifier cette fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der et c'est avec raison que le juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure d\u00e9clare qu'elle est \"contraire aux principes fondamentaux de la justice\".\nEn vertu de l'article 82 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, \"il ne peut \u00eatre adjug\u00e9 sur une demande judiciaire sans que la partie contre laquelle elle est form\u00e9e ait \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue ou d\u00fbment appel\u00e9e\". Et cette prescription a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e par la jurisprudence aux d\u00e9cisions quasi-judiciaires: Lapointe v. Association de Bienfaisance et de Retraite de la Police de Montreal 8, Board of Education v. Rice 9, Richelieu & Ontario Navigation v. Commercial Union Ass. 10; Ville de Bauharnois v. Liverpool, London & Globe Ins. Co. 11, Home Insurance Co. of New York v. Capuano 12. Il r\u00e9pugne \u00e0 la raison de croire qu'un tribunal quelconque puisse accorder une requ\u00eate avant d'en \u00eatre saisi. C'est l\u00e0 indiscutablement un emp\u00eachement radical \u00e0 l'exercice de la juridiction. C'est plus que le d\u00e9faut d'avis \u00e0 la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e; c'est une adjudication sur une proc\u00e9dure qui n'est pas devant le tribunal.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 plusieurs jugements \u00e0 l'effet que le d\u00e9faut d'avis \u00e0 la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e d\u00e9truit la juridiction et entra\u00eene la nullit\u00e9 de la sentence. Mais, pour d'excellentes raisons sur lesquelles il n'est pas besoin d'insister, il n'y a probablement pas jusqu'ici un seul jugement d'une cour sup\u00e9rieure se pronon\u00e7ant sur l'acte d'un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur qui aurait agi sur une requ\u00eate avant qu'il en soit saisi.\nQuel que soit le pouvoir d'exercer sa discr\u00e9tion que l'on veuille attribuer \u00e0 une commission du genre de la Commission des Relations ouvri\u00e8res de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, il ne s'agit plus ici de discr\u00e9tion mais de l'arbitraire le plus absolu ; et que l'on d\u00e9core du nom de tribunal administratif une commission du genre de la Commission intim\u00e9e, d\u00e8s qu'elle exerce un pouvoir quasi-judiciaire, comme elle l'a fait dans les circonstances, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'exercice de ce pouvoir elle doit \u00eatre assimil\u00e9e \u00e0 un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur dans le sens de l'article 1003 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile. Elle fait plus qu'exc\u00e9der sa juridiction; elle agit sans juridiction aucune et son acte donne lieu \u00e0 l'emploi du bref de prohibition. De nombreuses d\u00e9cisions dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec justifient la proc\u00e9dure qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente cause: Deniers v. Choquette 13; Montreal Street Railway v. Board of Conciliation 14; Maillet v. le Bureau des Gouverneurs du Coll\u00e8ge des Chirurgiens-dentistes 15; De Lamirande v. La Cour du Recorder 16.\nDans la cause de Toronto v. York 17, le Comit\u00e9 judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 eut \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer la constitution de \"The Ontario Municipal Board.\" Il d\u00e9cida:\nThe Ontario Municipal Board is primarily, in pith and substance, an administrative body. The members of the Municipal Board not having been appointed in accordance with the provisions of ss. 96, 99 and 100 of the British North America Act, 1887, which regulate the appointment of judges of Superior, District and County Courts, the Board is not validly constituted to receive judicial authority. Assuming that the Ontario Municipal Board Act, 1932, which set up the Board, does by some of its sections purport to constitute the Board a Court of Justice analogous to a Superior, District, or County Court, it is to that extent invalid. There is, however, nothing to suggest that the Board would not have been granted its administrative powers without the addition of the alleged judicial powers, and although, therefore, such parts of the Act of 1932 as purport to vest in the Board the functions of a Court have no effect, they are severable; and the Board is validly constituted for the performance of its administrative functions.\nLe jugement du Comit\u00e9 judiciaire fut prononc\u00e9 par Lord Atkin qui, apr\u00e8s avoir fait remarquer que \"The Ontario Municipal Board is not validly constituted to receive judicial authority\", ajoute:\nSo far, therefore, as the Act purports to constitute the Board a Court of Justice analogous to a Superior, District, or County Court, it is pro tanto invalid; \u2026 The result is that such parts of the Act as purport to vest in the Board the functions of a Court have no effect.\nSur toute cette question, il est tr\u00e8s instructif de lire le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec dans la cause du Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral v. Slanec et Grimstead 18. Ce jugement a infirm\u00e9 celui de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure rendu le 25 mai 1932 (70 C.S. p. 274), avec cependant la dissidence tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9e de l'honorable juge Rivard (54 B.R. p. 263), et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la Loi des accidents du travail (S.Q. 18 Geo V, cc. 79 et 80) \u00e9tait intra vires de la province, qui \u00e9tait comp\u00e9tente \u00e0 faire le choix et la nomination des membres de la Commission appel\u00e9e \u00e0 administrer la loi en question.\nMais, il est de jurisprudence constante que m\u00eame les commissions administratives sont sujettes \u00e0 la prohibition, tel qu'\u00e9dict\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 1003 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, lorsqu'elles exercent des fonctions judiciaires ou quasi-judiciaires, et il y a lieu alors au bref de prohibition, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s jugement rendu pour en emp\u00eacher l'ex\u00e9cution ou qu'il y soit donn\u00e9 effet.\nSur ce dernier point, je ne saurais admettre l'avis de MM. les juges Barclay et Casey en Cour du Banc de la Reine. Tous deux ont mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour le simple motif que le bref de prohibition \u00e9tait sans objet lors de son \u00e9mission et ne pouvait produire aucun effet, parce que, apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de la Commission des Relations ouvri\u00e8res, il ne restait plus rien \u00e0 prohiber ou emp\u00eacher. Il me semble en tout respect qu'il restait encore \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter la d\u00e9cision et que, si la proc\u00e9dure de l'Alliance r\u00e9ussissait \u00e0 faire d\u00e9clarer que cette d\u00e9cision avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue sans juridiction, non seulement elle \u00e9tait nulle et ne pouvait produire aucun effet, mais il s'ensuit que le certificat de reconnaissance subsiste dans toute sa vigueur et que la Commission intim\u00e9e est tenue de le consid\u00e9rer comme tel.\nJe crois donc que ce motif doit \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9. Ce n'est pas d'ailleurs celui de la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d'Appel.\nMais, pour revenir au jugement de premi\u00e8re instance, il ne fait pas de doute que le bref de prohibition peut \u00eatre adress\u00e9 m\u00eame \u00e0 l'encontre d'un tribunal administratif (si l'on arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que le tribunal particulier n'est pas une Cour de justice; et, sur ce point, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, le jugement dans la cause de Slanec supra est tr\u00e8s instructif), lorsque ce tribunal exerce des fonctions judiciaires ou quasi-judiciaires. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, en Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, cette question n'est plus discutable depuis l'arr\u00eat de cette Cour dans la cause de Segal v. la Cit\u00e9 de Montreal 19. Ce jugement fut unanime. Il s'agit d'un r\u00e8glement de la cit\u00e9 qui exige l'obtention pr\u00e9alable d'un permis pour toute personne, corporation ou soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avant de s'engager dans \"the business as canvasser.\" La discussion portait sur le sens de ces mots \"business as canvasser.\" La Cour du Recorder avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'appelant tombait sous cette description et naturellement la d\u00e9cision sur ce point \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour donner \u00e0 la Cour du Recorder juridiction sur le cas. La conclusion de la Cour Supr\u00eame \u00e9tait que:\nThe appellant was not doing business as canvasser within the meaning of the by-law and was under no obligation to take out a licence.\nLa question se posait alors de savoir si, en l'esp\u00e8ce, la Cour du Recorder \u00e9tait susceptible de l'application du bref de prohibition, en vertu de l'article 1003 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile.\nL'honorable juge Lamont, rendant le jugement de la Cour, commence par faire pr\u00e9c\u00e9der sa discussion de cette question par la remarque suivante :\nIn dealing with the question of prohibition it is important to bear in mind that the functions of a superior court on an application for a writ are in no sense those of a court of appeal. It has nothing to do with the merits of the dispute between the parties7; it is concerned only to see that the Recorder's Court did not transgress the limits of its jurisdiction. Il ajoute:\nThe first question which a judge has to ask himself, when he is invited to exercise a limited statutory jurisdiction, is whether the case falls within the defined ambit of the statute ; if it does not, his duty is to refuse to make an order as judge; and, if he makes an order, he may be restrained by prohibition. Davey, L.J., in Farquharson v. Morgan (1894, 1 Q.B. p. 552).\nApr\u00e8s avoir cit\u00e9 un passage du jugement de Lord Den-ham, C.J., dans The Queen v. Bolton 20, l'honorable juge Lamont d\u00e9clare:\nIt is now well settled law that where the jurisdiction of the judge of an inferior court depends upon the construction of a statute, he cannot give himself jurisdiction by misinterpreting the statute. Elston v. Rose (1868 L.R. 4 Q.B. p. 4) ; in re Long Point Co. v. Anderson (1891, 18 Ont. A.R. p. 401).\nPuis, il cite en l'approuvant la r\u00e8gle expos\u00e9e par M. le juge Ridddell dans Township of Ameliasburg v. Pitcher 21, qui est au m\u00eame effet, et il poursuit:\nIt has also been said that a judge of an inferior court cannot give himself jurisdiction by a wrong decision on the facts \u2026\ncar, dit-il,\nwhere the legislature has said that, if certain facts exist, the judge shall have jurisdiction, in such a case the existence of the facts is a condition precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction \u2026The rule, I think, may be stated in another way, as follows:\u2014\nIf the existence or non-existence of the jurisdiction of a judge of an inferior court depends upon a question of fact, then, if upon the facts proved or admitted he has no jurisdiction, his finding that he has jurisdiction will not prevent prohibition, but if the jurisdiction depends upon contested facts and there has been a real conflict of testimony upon some fact which goes to the question of jurisdiction, and the judge decides in such a way as to give himself jurisdiction, a superior court, on an application for prohibition, will hesitate before reversing his finding of fact and will only do so where the grounds are exceedingly strong. Mayor of London v. Cox (1867 L.R. 2 H.L. p. 239); Brown v. Cocking (1868 L.R. 3 Q.B. p. 672); Liverpool Gas Company v. Everton (1871 L.R. 6 C.P. p. 414); Rex v. Bradford (1908, 1 KB. p. 365 at 371).\nEt plus loin:\nI quite agree that if the statute had given the Recorder jurisdiction only where the person charged had been actually doing business as canvasser, then, upon this court coming to the conclusion that he had not been doing business, it would be our duty to direct a writ of prohibition to issue.\nDans cette affaire de Segal, cependant, apr\u00e8s avoir expos\u00e9 la doctrine comme nous venons de le voir, la Cour en vint \u00e0 la conclusion que le statut ne limitait pas la juri- diction de la Cour du Recorder dans le sens des constatations qui viennent d'\u00eatre faites et le bref de prohibition fut refus\u00e9.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente instance, la Commission intim\u00e9e agissait indiscutablement en une fonction quasi-judiciaire. L'Alliance poss\u00e9dait le certificat de reconnaissance \u00e9mis par la Commission intim\u00e9e elle-m\u00eame. En vertu de l'article 7 de la Loi des relations ouvri\u00e8res, la Commission, avant d'\u00e9mettre le certificat, devait s'assurer du caract\u00e8re repr\u00e9sentatif de l'Alliance et de son droit d'\u00eatre reconnue, apr\u00e8s avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 cette fin \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification de ses livres et archives. Cet article 7 emploie bien les mots: \"droit d'\u00eatre reconnu.\"\nD'autre part, en vertu de l'article 41, la Commission peut, pour cause, reviser ou r\u00e9voquer toute d\u00e9cision et tout ordre rendus par elle et tout certificat qu'elle a \u00e9mis. Ce pouvoir lui est donc donn\u00e9 seulement \"pour cause.\"\nNous avons donc ici la situation que le droit de l'Alliance avait \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu par la Commission intim\u00e9e et que cette reconnaissance ne pouvait plus \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e arbitrairement, ni m\u00eame dans l'exercice d'une discr\u00e9tion, mais seulement \"pour cause.\" En cons\u00e9quence, en r\u00e9voquant le certificat de l'Alliance, la Commission intim\u00e9e la privait de son droit et la d\u00e9cision qu'elle rendait ainsi \u00e9tait strictement une d\u00e9cision judiciaire o\u00f9 la Commission intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait appel\u00e9e \u00e0 juger qu'il existait une cause pour enlever ce droit \u00e0 l'Alliance.\nEn pareil cas, la r\u00e8gle est que la partie dont le droit est en jeu doit \u00eatre entendue et que l'opportunit\u00e9 lui soit fournie de se d\u00e9fendre. Sur ce point, il existe une jurisprudence abondante: Maillet v. le Bureau des Gouverneurs du Coll\u00e8ge des Chirurgiens-dentistes 22, In re Ashby 23, d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'Appel d'Ontario; et surtout l'arr\u00eat du Comit\u00e9 judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans une cause de Qu\u00e9bec: Lapointe v. Association de Bienfaisance et de retraite de la Police de Montreal 24, o\u00f9 l'on trouve ce qui suit:\nThey are bound in the exercise of their functions by the rule expressed in the maxim 'Audi alteram partem' that no man should be condemned to consequence resulting from alleged misconduct unheard, and without having the opportunity of making his defence. This rule is not confined to the conduct of strictly legal tribunals, but is applicable to every tribunal or body of persons invested with authority to adjudicate upon matters involving civil consequences to individuals.\nLa maxime \"audi alteram partem\" est, si l'on peut dire, i un principe v\u00e9n\u00e9rable. Elle est reconnue dans la loi elle-m\u00eame. L'article 50 donne certains pouvoirs \u00e0 la Commission des Relations ouvri\u00e8res et stipule que, dans le cas d'infractions \u00e0 la Section des pratiques interdites, la Commission peut, sans pr\u00e9judice de toute autre peine, prononcer la dissolution de l'association, mais \"apr\u00e8s lui avoir donn\u00e9 l'occasion d'\u00eatre entendue et de faire toute preuve tendant \u00e0 se disculper.\" En Cour d'Appel, on a fait observer que cette prescription n'\u00e9tait express\u00e9ment introduite dans la loi que pour le cas des infractions \u00e0 la Section des pratiques interdites et l'on a voulu appliquer ici le principe que la mention pour un cas particulier exclut l'application pour les autres cas qui n'y sont pas mentionn\u00e9s. L'on ajoute qu'en ce qui concerne l'application de l'article 41, qui permet \u00e0 la Commission de r\u00e9voquer \"pour cause\" toute d\u00e9cision et tout ordre rendus par elle et tout certificat qu'elle a \u00e9mis, la loi est silencieuse quant \u00e0 l'obligation d'entendre le d\u00e9tenteur du certificat de reconnaissance et de lui fournir toute opportunit\u00e9 de se d\u00e9fendre.\nMais, sous ce rapport, la r\u00e8gle pos\u00e9e par Maxwell : \"On the Interpretation of Statutes\", 4 \u00e9d., p. 546, me para\u00eet s'appliquer :\nAgain, in giving judicial powers to affect prejudicially the rights of person or property, a statute is understood as silently implying, when it does not expressly provide, the condition or qualification that the power is to be exercised in accordance with the fundamental rules of judicial procedure, such for instance as that which requires that before its exercise, the person sought to be prejudicially affected shall have an opportunity of defending himself.\nEt Maxwell (p. 467) pr\u00e9voit l'objection que la stipulation expresse pour un cas particulier n'implique pas n\u00e9cessairement que ce pr\u00e9cepte d'ordre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme exclus d'un autre cas o\u00f9 la loi est rest\u00e9e silencieuse. En r\u00e9sumant les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents sur ce point, il exprime l'opinion suivante (p. 467) :\nProvisions sometimes found in statutes enacting imperfectly or for particular cases only that which was already and more widely the law have occasionally furnished ground for the contention that an intention to alter the general law was to be inferred from the partial or limited enactment; resting on the maxim 'Expressio unius est exclusio alterius.' But that maxim is inapplicable in such cases. Voir sur ce point le jugement de Farwell L.J. Re Lowe v. Darling & Son 25:\nThe generality of the maxim 'Expression facit cessare taciturn' which was relied on, renders caution necessary in its application. It is not enough that the express and the tacit are merely incongruous; it must be clear that they cannot reasonably be intended to co-exist. In Colquhoun v. Brooks (19 Q.B.D. 400 at p. 406) Wills J. says: 'May observe that the method of construction summarised in the maxim \"Expressio unius exclusio ulterius\" is one that certainly requires to be watched \u2026 The failure to make the \"expressio\" complete very often arises from accident, very often from the fact that it never struck the draftsman that the thing supposed to be excluded needed specific mention of any kind. Lopes L.J. in the Court of Appeal (21 Q.B.D. 52 at p. 65) says : 'The maxim \"Expressio in unius exclusio alterius\" has been pressed upon us. I agree with what is said in the Court below by Wills J. about this maxim. It is often a valuable servant, but a dangerous master to follow in the construction of statutes or documents. The exclusio is often the result of inadvertence or accident, and the maxim ought not to be applied, when its application, having regard to the subject-matter to which it is to be applied, leads to inconsistency or injustice.'\nLe principe que nul ne doit \u00eatre condamn\u00e9 ou priv\u00e9 de ses droits sans \u00eatre entendu, et surtout sans avoir m\u00eame re\u00e7u avis que ses droits seraient mis en jeu est d'une \u00e9quit\u00e9 universelle et ce n'est pas le silence de la loi qui devrait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 pour en priver quelqu'un. A mon avis, il ne faudrait rien moins qu'une d\u00e9claration expresse du l\u00e9gislateur pour mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 cette exigence qui s'applique \u00e0 tous les tribunaux et \u00e0 tous les corps appel\u00e9s \u00e0 rendre une d\u00e9cision qui aurait pour effet d'annuler un droit poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par un individu.\nIl est bon de faire remarquer ici qu'en vertu de l'article 51 de la Loi des relations ouvri\u00e8res \"nulle d\u00e9cision de la Commission ne fait preuve pour des fins autres que celles express\u00e9ment pr\u00e9vues par la pr\u00e9sente loi ou par la Loi des diff\u00e9rends entre les services publics et leurs salari\u00e9s.\"\nIl ne reste plus qu'\u00e0 consid\u00e9rer un argument qui a eu la faveur de l'opinion exprim\u00e9e par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc de la Reine (en appel).\nDans leur contestation les intim\u00e9es ont soutenu que la Commission des Relations ouvri\u00e8res de Qu\u00e9bec poss\u00e8de tous les pouvoirs, immunit\u00e9s et privil\u00e8ges de commissaires nomm\u00e9s en vertu de la Loi des commissions d'enqu\u00eate et que, par cons\u00e9quent, nul bref de prohibition ou d'injonction ne peut entraver ou arr\u00eater leurs proc\u00e9dures. C'est l'article 36 de la Loi des relations ouvri\u00e8res. Et, si l'on r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 l'article 17 de la Loi des commissions d'enqu\u00eate (S.R.Q. c. 9), cet article est \u00e0 l'effet que \"nul bref d'injonction ou de prohibition et nulle autre proc\u00e9dure. l\u00e9gale ne peuvent entraver ou arr\u00eater les proc\u00e9dures des commissaires \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate.\"\nDe m\u00eame que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, je serais d'avis que \"rien ne permet de conclure que la l\u00e9gislature ait voulu rendre ce texte applicable \u00e0 la Commission des Relations ouvri\u00e8res.\" Comme il le fait remarquer, l'article 17, vu qu'il limite un recours, doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 strictement; et il ne d\u00e9fend pas compl\u00e8tement le recours au bref de prohibition, il d\u00e9fend seulement que l'on s'en serve pour entraver les proc\u00e9dures des commissaires \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate.\nIl ne saurait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 pour emp\u00eacher la prohibition \u00e0 rencontre d'une d\u00e9cision rendue en absence de toute juridiction.\nD\u00e9j\u00e0, nous avons vu que la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de cette question dans la cause de Segal v. la Cit\u00e9 de Montreal supra. Nous le r\u00e9p\u00e9tons, un tribunal ne peut s'attribuer \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame une juridiction qu'il n'a pas. Il semble que cette proposition est tellement \u00e9vidente qu'elle n'a pas besoin de d\u00e9monstration. En plus, toute restriction aux pouvoirs de contr\u00f4le et de surveillance d'un tribunal sup\u00e9rieur est n\u00e9cessairement inop\u00e9rante lorsqu'il s'agit pour lui d'emp\u00eacher l'ex\u00e9cution d'une d\u00e9cision, d'un ordre ou d'une sentence rendue en l'absence de juridiction.\nPareille d\u00e9cision, ordre ou sentence est, de toute fa\u00e7on, Ultra vires et par cons\u00e9quent absolument nulle. Le l\u00e9gislateur, m\u00eame s'il le voulait, ne pourrait d\u00e9clarer l'absurdit\u00e9 qu'un tribunal qui agit sans juridiction peut \u00eatre immunis\u00e9 contre l'application du bref de prohibition. Sa d\u00e9cision est nulle et aucun texte d'un statut ne peut lui donner de la validit\u00e9 ou d\u00e9cider que, malgr\u00e9 sa nullit\u00e9, cette d\u00e9cision devrait quand m\u00eame \u00eatre reconnue comme valide et \u00eatre ex\u00e9cutoire.\nIl y aurait beaucoup \u00e0 dire sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de ces articles des statuts qui se g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisent et qui ont pour objet d'emp\u00eacher les tribunaux sup\u00e9rieurs d'examiner la validit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cisions rendues par telle ou telle commission et de fermer la porte \u00e0 l'acc\u00e8s aux tribunaux r\u00e9guliers du pays. Ici, la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l'article qu'on veut opposer \u00e0 l'Alliance n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e. Il est probable que la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada pourrait la soulever proprio motu. Il faudrait, sans doute, que le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada et celui de la province de Qu\u00e9bec en fussent avis\u00e9s. Je n'h\u00e9siterais pas, pour ma part, \u00e0 ordonner que cet avis leur fut adress\u00e9; mais il vaut mieux attendre que cette question devienne essentielle pour la d\u00e9cision d'une cause.\nDans l'affaire qui nous est soumise cela n'est pas essentiel, car il est \u00e9vident qu'un tribunal quel qu'il soit ne peut proc\u00e9der \u00e0 adjuger sur une requ\u00eate qui n'est pas encore devant lui. Cela est suffisant. En plus, je ne saurais en venir \u00e0 la conclusion qu'un tribunal, m\u00eame saisi d'une requ\u00eate, peut proc\u00e9der \u00e0 d\u00e9pouiller d'un droit un citoyen canadien ou une association quelconque qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 que demande en serait faite \u00e0 ce tribunal, qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu et \u00e0 qui toute opportunit\u00e9 de se d\u00e9fendre a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9ni\u00e9e.\nJe suis tout \u00e0 fait de l'avis du juge de premi\u00e8re instance que, dans la cause qui nous est soumise, la mani\u00e8re de proc\u00e9der de la Commission intim\u00e9e \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 un d\u00e9ni de justice.\nPour ces raisons, sur lesquelles j'ai eu \u00e0 m'expliquer aussi longuement que possible, je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu, le jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine infirm\u00e9 et le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure r\u00e9tabli, avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les Cours contre la Commission des Relations ouvri\u00e8res de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.:\u2014Even though an admittedly illegal strike had been called by the appellant and had commenced, the respondent, the Labour Relations Board, was bound to give notice to the appellant before acting under section 41 of the Labour Relations Act to cancel the appellant's certificate which had been granted May 12, 1944. The Board would then have heard any representations the appellant desired to make in order to explain the circumstances under which the strike was called, and it could then have proceeded to decide whether the certificate should be cancelled. Many cases, of which Board of Education v. Rice 26 and L'Association de Bienfaisance et de Retraite de la police de Montreal 27, may be taken as typical, show that such a body as the Board is bound in the exercise of its functions by the rule expressed in the maxim \"audi alteram partem.\"\nThe appellant was entitled to notice notwithstanding that section 41 does not in terms require it. Reliance was placed by some members of the Court below upon section 50 of the Act :\u2014\n50. If it be proved to the Board that an association has participated in an offence against section 20 the Board may, without prejudice to any other penalty, decree the dissolution of such association after giving it an opportunity to be heard and to produce any evidence tending to exculpate it.\nIn the case of a professional syndicate, an authentic copy of the decision shall be transmitted to the Provincial Secretary who shall give notice thereof in the Quebec Official Gazette.\nIt was considered that since this section specified that the Board, before acting, should give an association an opportunity of being heard and producing evidence, the Legislature must have intended that no notice was necessary under section 41. With respect I think the true view is that since the Legislature must be presumed to know that notice is required by the general rule, it would be necessary for it to use explicit terms in order to absolve the Board from the necessity of giving notice.\nIn this view of the matter, the appellant was entitled to ask for a declaration of nullity and, as my brother Fauteux shows in his reasons, there is nothing incompatible in such a claim being joined to a request for prohibition. Holding as I do that the appellant is entitled to succeed in its claim for a declaration of nullity, it is unnecessary to consider the various arguments advanced as to the applicability of the writ of prohibition and as to whether, as was held by Barclay J. and Casey J., the application therefor was too late.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) set aside. The judgment at the trial should also be set aside and in lieu thereof there should be a declaration that in revoking on January 21, 1949, its certificate of May 12, 1944, which had recognized the appellant \"comme agent n\u00e9gociateur de tous les instituteurs et institutrices qui enseignent en fran\u00e7ais dans les \u00e9coles fran\u00e7aises de la mise-en-cause,\" the respondent Board acted without jurisdiction and that such revocation is null and of no effect. The appellant is entitled to its costs throughout against the respondent. Rand J.:\u2014Three questions are raised in this appeal: whether a strike called in violation of the provisions of the Labour Relations Act and of the Public Services Employees Disputes Act is a cause for revoking a certificate of representation issued under sec. 9 of the Labor Act to a syndicate incorporated under the Professional Syndicates Act: whether the Labor Board can, without a hearing, revoke such a certificate; and whether an action claiming a writ of prohibition brought after a purported revocation can, for any purpose, be maintained.\nThe members of the syndicate Association in these proceedings are French teachers in French Catholic schools of Montreal. The certificate was issued on May 12, 1944. In June 1947, negotiations were commenced for a revision of the working arrangement then in effect with the Montreal Catholic School Commission, but the parties were unable to reach agreement. The dispute was accordingly submitted to arbitration under the Public Services Employees Disputes Act. On August 27, 1948, the Board of Arbitration rendered its decision which applied to the year ending June 30, 1948 only. Against this the Association appealed to the Quebec Municipal Commission which affirmed the award. On September 7, while that appeal was pending, the Association again presented to the School Commission the proposals which had previously been rejected. After further negotiations and at least one meeting with representatives of the provincial Government, a strike was called on January 16, 1949 which continued from the 17th until the 21st of that month. As the result of a communication from the School Commission, the Labor Board on the 21st issued an order revoking the certificate. The strike was thereupon called off.\nOn the 27th of January the Association presented a petition to Edge J. for leave to issue a writ of summons in which the relief sought was a declaration of the invalidity of the order of revocation and the issue of a writ of prohibition to the Labor Board and the School Commission. Leave was given and at the same time an order made restraining the defendants until the final adjudication from acting in any manner on the revocation. The action was maintained at the trial before Savard J. for the reasons, among others:\u2014\n(a) La r\u00e9vocation de la franchise syndicale de la requ\u00e9rante a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme peine pour infractions \u00e0 la Loi des Diff\u00e9rends entre les services publics et leurs salari\u00e9s, alors que cette loi a pr\u00e9vu d'autres peines pour de telles infractions, et c'est aux tribunaux seulement qu'il appartient de les appliquer.\n(b) Le retrait de la reconnaissance syndicale n'\u00e9tait ni plus ni moins qu'une confiscation.\n(c) Il est contraire aux principes fondamentaux de la justice qu'une d\u00e9cision judiciaire ou quasi-judiciaire soit rendue, sans audition des parties.\n(d) Le d\u00e9faut d'avis \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante qui \u00e9tait la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, d\u00e9truit la juridiction de la Commission et entra\u00eene la nullit\u00e9 de la sentence qu'elle a rendue.\nOn appeal to the Court of King's Bench 28, this judgment was reversed on the grounds of the majority that the Labor Board, not being an inferior court, was not subject to prohibition, and that in any event, the Board had acted within its jurisdiction ; but by Barclay J. because, as nothing further remained to be done by the Labor Board, prohibition would be ineffectual and did not lie.\nThe object of the Labor Act, the provisions of which, it must be said, are of a most skeletal nature, is to promote the reconciliation, with the least waste, and by rational means, of the conflicting interests of employers and employees. Indirectly it seeks the broader object of maintaining confidence and faith of the community in itself and in its solidarity in freedom by furnishing means for reaching adjustments between those who employ and those employed in the execution of the various functions of our complex life.\nThose objects furnish us with trustworthy indications of the scope within which the legislation was conceived and enacted and was intended to be administered. Can we then, in such a perspective, attribute to the language of the legislature the intention that any breach of the provisions of either statute, such as a strike, ipso facto and regardless of any circumstances attending it, should be cause for which, under sec. 41 of the Labor Act, the Board may revoke the certificate? The effect of revocation would be to deprive the syndicate of its right to require negotiation by the employer until, on the basis of Mr. Beaulieu's argument, the Board a in its wisdom thought the punishment had been sufficient or until the Association, to the satisfaction of the Board, in some form or other, had purged itself of its sin. Until then, the Association would, in effect, be outlawed. Can that, on any reasonable view of the language and objects of the statute as a whole, be reconciled with promoting harmony in any service or work, public or private? Mr. Beaulieu says that the strike shows the Association not to be a group that seeks its objects \"with respect for law and authority\" as the concluding language of the definition of \"Association\" puts it, but this cannot be taken seriously. On his argument, these teachers have been put in leading strings to the Labor Board and their interests balanced on the peril of absolute obedience to this administrative agency acting, as the argument goes, with a discretionary power beyond juridical interference.\nNeither statute provides either for that total subordination or that unlimited discretion. Express provision is made for the punishment of every person participating in a violation of any of their terms. It is a basic rule that where an Act creates an offence and provides a penalty for it, the latter, in the absence of language indicating a contrary intent, is to be presumed to be the only punishment intended: Beal's Cardinal Rules of Interpretation, 3rd Ed. p. 483. There is nothing from which the slightest implication can be drawn that other punishment was intended to be permitted : but the Board has imposed other punishment compared with which the pecuniary penalties authorized, though substantial, are insignificant.\nThe provisions of sec. 4 of the Labor Act bear directly upon this question:\u2014\nTout employeur est tenu de reconna\u00eetre comme repr\u00e9sentant collectif des salari\u00e9s \u00e0 son emploi les repr\u00e9sentants d'une association groupant a majorit\u00e9 absolue desdits salari\u00e9s et de n\u00e9gocier, de bonne foi, avec eux, une convention collective de travail.\nPlusieurs associations de salari\u00e9s peuvent s'unir pour former cette majorit\u00e9 et nommer des repr\u00e9sentants pour fins de n\u00e9gociation collective \u00e0 telles conditions non incompatibles avec la pr\u00e9sente loi qu'elles peuvent juger opportunes. The task of the Board, upon an application, is seen to be to ascertain whether the state of facts specified is present; secs. 5, 6, 7 and 8 elaborate this conception in the clearest terms; and once those facts are found, the Board is bound to recognize the Association as the bargaining agent and by sec. 9, to issue the certificate. It follows, then, that immediately upon the cancellation of the certificate, the Association would, under the conditions of sec. 4, be entitled to apply for its certificate anew, and assuming them to exist as before, the recognition and the certification must at once have followed. These considerations are incompatible with authority to revoke solely on the ground that there has been a violation of a penal provision of the statute.\nThe second objection is that before revoking the certificate for cause, the Board must hear the party to be affected by that action. Audi alteram partem is a pervading principle of our law, and is peculiarly applicable to the interpretation of statutes which delegate judicial action in any form to inferior tribunals: in making decisions of a judicial nature they must hear both sides, and there is nothing in the statute here qualifying the application of that principle.\nThe only answer suggested to this is that the Board, being an \"administrative body\", can, in effect, act as it pleases. But in this we are too much the prisoners of words. In one sense of administration, in the enactment of subordinate legislation or quasi-legislation, the principle has a limited application ; but in the complexity of governmental activities today, a so-called administrative board may be charged not only with administrative and executive but also with judicial functions, and it is these functions to which we must direct our attention. When of a judicial character, they affect the extinguishment or modification of private rights or interests. The rights here, some recognized and other conferred by the statute, depend for their full exercise upon findings by the Board; but they are not created by the Board nor are they enjoyed at the mere will of the Board; and the Association can be deprived of their benefits only by means of a procedure inherent in judicial process.\nMr. Beaulieu cites Burgess v. Brockton 29, where the question concerned the revocation of licenses granted to taxi owners to carry on their business within the city. The city charter conferred power to deal generally with transportation carried on in the streets, and the situation arose that if the competition of the taxi cabs with the street railway continued, the latter would be compelled, because of financial reasons, to cease operations. It became therefore a subject of purely public interest whether only the one or the other mode of transportation should be permitted. What the Council of Brockton did was, in effect, to enact subordinate legislation, but there is nothing of that nature here.\nThe final question is whether, seeing that the revocation, though a nullity, exhausted the Board's action, the proceeding for any purpose can be maintained. In dealing with this question I do not find it necessary to examine the scope of art. 1003 C.P. but I agree with Barclay J. that in the situation presented, prohibition would be futile. Necessarily involved in such a proceeding, however, is the finding that the act challenged is beyond the jurisdiction of the tribunal purporting to make it. Unlike the direct procedure at English common law, the application under the Code of Procedure is, as stated, by way of a writ of summons. By that writ the ordinary action is commenced; and the petition presented here, setting forth the facts, furnishes all of the allegations necessary to a declaration or statement of claim. To the petition a defence was entered, and the issues were tried out as in the ordinary case.\nCan that necessary finding and declaration, then, be maintained even though the writ itself should be denied? I see nothing in the articles of the Code of Procedure against it. In Samson v. Drolet 30, this Court held that, on a dilatory exception, demands in the nature of penalties for misconduct in office provided by a statute could be joined with the relief of quo warranto. Quo warranto is provided for by sec. 2 of c. 40 of the Code of Procedure, which contains nothing permitting such a joinder. The claims were allowed because, although having different sources, they had the same origin in fact and were of similar character. Here we have not only that similarity in character and identity of origin, but also the essential condition of the main relief. The claim for prohibition was made in good faith; but the substantial contest was over the authority of the Board to revoke the certificate as it was done. We are asked to hold that because, in strict formality, prohibition would be ineffectual, the proceedings in which every feature of the controversy has been examined C should be rejected as futile and wasted. Since we have, in substance, the procedure, the matter and the decision on the real issue, it would be a miscarriage of justice to dispose of them in such a manner.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) set aside. The judgment at the trial should also be set aside and in lieu thereof there should be a declaration that in revoking on January 21, 1949, its certificate of May 12, 1944, which had recognized the appellant \"comme agent n\u00e9gociateur de tous les instituteurs et institutrices qui enseignent en fran\u00e7ais dans les \u00e9coles fran\u00e7aises de la mise-en-cause,\" the respondent Board acted without jurisdiction and that such revocation is null and of no effect. The appellant is entitled to its costs throughout against the respondent.\nFauteux J.:\u2014Je concours au maintien de cet appel et sans qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire de relater \u00e0 nouveau et en d\u00e9tail les faits, proc\u00e9dures et jugements y conduisant, je d\u00e9sire simplement souligner certains des motifs m'amenant \u00e0 cette conclusion.\nEn \u00e9mettant, le 12 mai 1944, et en maintenant depuis lors et jusqu'au 21 janvier 1949, un certificat attestant que l'appelante \u00e9tait l'agent n\u00e9gociateur de tous les instituteurs et institutrices qui enseignent le fran\u00e7ais dans les \u00e9coles fran\u00e7aises de la mise-en-cause, l'intim\u00e9e reconnaissait que l'Alliance des Professeurs Catholiques de Montreal, association constitu\u00e9e sous l'empire de la Loi des Syndicats Professionnels du Qu\u00e9bec (S.R.Q., 1941 c. 162), \u00e9tait, aux termes de la Loi des Relations Ouvri\u00e8res (S.R.Q., 1941 c. 162A), une association groupant la majorit\u00e9 absolue de ces salari\u00e9s \u00e0 l'emploi de la mise-en-cause et, comme telle, l'association exclusivement qualifi\u00e9e, suivant la loi, pour n\u00e9gocier avec l'employeur une convention collective.

Lapointe v. L''Association de Bienfaisance et de Retraite de la Police de Montreal 31:\nThey are bound in the exercise of their functions by the rule expressed in the maxim 'audi alteram partem' that no man should be condemned to consequence resulting from alleged misconduct unheard, and without having the opportunity of making his defence. This rule is not confined to the conduct of strictly legal tribunals, but is applicable to every tribunal or body of persons invested with authority to adjudicate upon matters involving civil consequences to individuals.\nEn adjugeant, comme susdit, sur la demande de la mise-en-cause s'appuyant, en droit, sur son interpr\u00e9tation de la Loi des Relations Ouvri\u00e8res et, particuli\u00e8rement, des dispositions de l'article 41 de cette loi, et, en fait, sur l'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la gr\u00e8ve, l'intim\u00e9e remplissait, au sens m\u00eame des pr\u00e9cisions apport\u00e9es, en particulier, par M. le Juge Pratte dans la cause de Giroux v.

Et quelle que soit l'extension susceptible d'\u00eatre donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation du mot \"cause\" de l'article 41, en relation avec la r\u00e9vocation du certificat, il est certain que dans les limites d'une interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gale, on ne saurait inclure une cause dont la reconnaissance et le jeu seraient, dans le r\u00e9sultat, incompatibles avec les dispositions de la loi o\u00f9 il se trouve. Et si, comme le pr\u00e9tend l'intim\u00e9e en r\u00e9ponse au premier moyen soulev\u00e9 par l'appelante la loi lui permettait de s'enqu\u00e9rir si l'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la gr\u00e8ve pouvait autoriser la r\u00e9vocation du certicat, en proc\u00e9dant de fait \u00e0 ce faire et en en d\u00e9terminant le point, elle accomplissait une fonction d'ordre judiciaire. Effectivement, l'intim\u00e9e, en l'esp\u00e8ce, a examin\u00e9 les faits \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l'interpr\u00e9tation qu'elle a donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la loi et a, de ce chef, d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l'appelante d\u00e9chue du droit d'\u00eatre reconnue comme agent n\u00e9gociateur. Cette d\u00e9termination, l'intim\u00e9e ne pouvait la faire sans entendre, ou au moins sans donner l'opportunit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelante d'\u00eatre entendue, non seulement sur le fait mais sur le droit lui-m\u00eame. Voir la d\u00e9cision de la Chambre des Lords dans Board of Education v. Rice 33, et particuli\u00e8rement au deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de la page 182. Cette d\u00e9cision fut appliqu\u00e9e par cette Cour dans Mantha v. The City of Montreal 34. Voir \u00e0 la page 466, aux raisons de Sir Lyman Duff, Juge en chef, qui rendit le jugement de la majorit\u00e9. On ne peut, comme le pr\u00e9tend l'intim\u00e9e, corriger la position en all\u00e9guant que le fait et l'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la gr\u00e8ve \u00e9taient de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 publique et que cela \u00e9tait m\u00eame conc\u00e9d\u00e9 par l'appelante. \u00c9rig\u00e9e en doctrine et pouss\u00e9e \u00e0 ses justes limites, cette pr\u00e9tention pourrait justifier la supression totale de toute proc\u00e9dure et la mise \u00e0 n\u00e9ant des principes fondamentaux r\u00e9gissant l'exercice de la fonction judiciaire. Il reste, d'ailleurs, que l'appelante avait aussi le droit d'\u00eatre entendue, ou d'\u00eatre appel\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00eatre, sur la question de droit que l'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tendait pouvoir soulever et d\u00e9terminer, savoir si cette ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 constituait une cause de r\u00e9vocation du certificat.\nIl est de r\u00e8gle que l'application du principe audi alteram partem est implicitement sous-entendue dans les lois attribuant aux corps administratifs des fonctions d'ordre judiciaire. Maxwell: On Interpretation of Statutes, 9th ed., 368. Le L\u00e9gislateur est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 tenir compte de cette r\u00e8gle en \u00e9dictant ces lois. Pour en suspendre l'op\u00e9ration, il faut donc, dans la loi, un texte explicite \u00e0 cet effet ou une inf\u00e9rence en ayant l'\u00e9quivalence. (Maxwell, op. cit. 318). Il n'y a, en l'esp\u00e8ce, aucun texte \u00e0 cet effet et la comparison des dispositions de l'article 41 avec celles de l'article 50 de la Loi des Relations Ouvri\u00e8res ne justifie pas une inf\u00e9rence ayant la valeur requise en la mati\u00e8re pour \u00e9tablir que le L\u00e9gislateur a clairement voulu faire exception au principe. Voir aussi, sur la port\u00e9e de la maxime d'interpr\u00e9tation Expressio unius exclusio alterius, la d\u00e9cision rendue dans Lowe v. Dorling & Son 35.\nIl faut donc consid\u00e9rer ce second moyen comme fond\u00e9 et d\u00e9clarer que la r\u00e9vocation prononc\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e est nulle et sans effet.\nMais, poursuit l'intim\u00e9e, l'appelante ne peut r\u00e9ussir sur la prohibition puisque, en fait, la d\u00e9cision \u00e9tant rendue, la fonction judiciaire de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait \u00e9puis\u00e9e et qu'en droit, comme il n'y avait plus rien \u00e0 prohiber, au moment o\u00f9 l'action fut initi\u00e9e en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, une prohibition sans objet ne pouvait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. Il n'appara\u00eet pas n\u00e9cessaire de s'arr\u00eater \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration du bien ou mal fond\u00e9 de ces pr\u00e9tentions de fait et de droit au sujet desquelles il y aurait, \u00e0 raison des dispositions de la Loi des Relations Ouvri\u00e8res, plusieurs questions \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer. Par ailleurs, et dans les conclusions de son action, l'appelante a non seulement demand\u00e9 d' \"Ordonner aux intim\u00e9s de surseoir \u00e0 toutes proc\u00e9dures dans la cause ci-haut mentionn\u00e9e et plus particuli\u00e8rement de surseoir \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de la d\u00e9cision ci-dessus r\u00e9cit\u00e9e\", mais \u00e9galement de \"D\u00e9clarer qu'il y a d\u00e9faut de juridiction de la part des intim\u00e9s dans l'affaire ci-dessus all\u00e9gu\u00e9e et d\u00e9clarer nulle et de nul effet ladite d\u00e9cision.\" Sans doute, l'appelante avait int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 rechercher, en addition d'une d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9, une ordonnance de prohibition comme recours le plus appropri\u00e9, avantageux et efficace et, ce, \u00e0 raison, particuli\u00e8rement, des sursis provisoires auxquels donne lieu ce rem\u00e8de particulier, ainsi qu'affirm\u00e9 par M. le Juge Dorion dans Rossi v. Lacroix 36, et reconnu au jugement du 8 f\u00e9vrier 1950 rendu par la Cour d'Appel en la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Mais il n'en reste pas moins que dans les conclusions de l'appelante, il y a deux recours, soit un de nullit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision et l'autre de prohibition. Du bien fond\u00e9 du premier d\u00e9pend, en principe, le bien fond\u00e9 du second. Ces deux recours sont donc, non seulement compatibles et non contradictoires, mais le premier \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire au second. L'appelante pouvait, par ailleurs, n'exercer que le premier en prenant une action directe pour faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 comme nulle la d\u00e9cision de la Commission. Et le fait que le bien fond\u00e9 de ce recours en nullit\u00e9 soit, dans la proc\u00e9dure actuelle, une pr\u00e9misse n\u00e9cessaire au bien fond\u00e9 du recours en prohibition ne saurait,\u2014en supposant que, pour la raison all\u00e9gu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e, la prohibition ne puisse \u00eatre d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce, \u2014priver l'appelante d'une adjudication particuli\u00e8re et au m\u00e9rite sur son recours en nullit\u00e9. Dans Turcotte v. Dansereau 37, l'honorable Juge Taschereau, subs\u00e9quemment Juge en chef, rendant jugement pour cette Cour, disait, particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 la page 587:\u2014\nThe insufficiency of a litigant's allegations may be fatal to his claim, but if he alleges more than is necessary, or adds to a legitimate demand conclusions which he is not entitled to, that is no reason to reject the whole of his demand.\nLes tribunaux reconnaissent l'action directe en pareille mati\u00e8re, (Mantha v. City of Montreal, cit\u00e9e plus haut), comme, d'ailleurs, en certaines circonstances, ils admettent l'action directe pour mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 m\u00eame le jugement des Cours. Particuli\u00e8rement la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'Appel dans Legault v. Surprenant et Faquin v. Surprenant 38, o\u00f9 l'on confirma \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 le jugement de feu l'honorable Juge Archer et d\u00e9cr\u00e9ta que l'action directe peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e par le d\u00e9fendeur condamn\u00e9 par d\u00e9faut, qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement assign\u00e9e devant le tribunal, pour faire d\u00e9clarer nul le jugement rendu contre lui et que ce recours existe ind\u00e9pendamment des autres recours. Rendant le jugement pour la Cour d'Appel, M. le Juge Dorion dit \u00e0 la page 230:\u2014\nNotre jurisprudence a toujours admis ce recours \u00e0 l'action directe, parce que c'est un principe absolu dans notre droit que personne ne peut \u00eatre condamn\u00e9 sans avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9, (C.P., 82). Il en r\u00e9sulte qu'un jugement rendu contre un d\u00e9fendeur qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 est nul et que cette nullit\u00e9 peut toujours \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e par les moyens ordinaires de la proc\u00e9dure. Turcotte & Dansereau, 27 S.C.R. 583.\nMais alors pourquoi le Code indique-t-il un mode sp\u00e9cial de r\u00e9vision des jugements rendus par d\u00e9faut? C'est qu'il peut \u00eatre urgent d'y avoir recours pour obtenir la suspension de l'ex\u00e9cution du jugement (1172 C.P.). C'est pourquoi la requ\u00eate doit \u00eatre accompagn\u00e9e d'affidavit et des moyens de d\u00e9fense. Mais le d\u00e9faut d'assignation est un excellent moyen de d\u00e9fense par lui-m\u00eame.\nLa loi, d'une part, reconna\u00eet le droit de cumuler des recours compatibles et non contradictoires dans une m\u00eame demande, (Art. 87 C.P.C.), mais ne favorise pas l'inutile multiplicit\u00e9 des actions et des frais en r\u00e9sultant. Si, comme je le crois, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission pouvait \u00eatre attaqu\u00e9e par action directe, pr\u00e9tendre que ce recours devait, en l'esp\u00e8ce, \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 s\u00e9par\u00e9ment du recours en prohibition,\u2014 soit par une action distincte,\u2014pour \u00e9viter qu'un jugement adverse sur ce dernier emp\u00eache une adjudication sur le premier, n'est-il pas vouloir justifier une inutile litispendance sur le recours en nullit\u00e9? Aussi bien, je ne vois pas que le d\u00e9faut d'objet du recours en prohibition puisse, en l'instance, affecter le m\u00e9rite du recours en nullit\u00e9.\nAjoutons que cette cause est, sur le point, bien diff\u00e9rente de celle de Segal v. Cit\u00e9 de Montreal 39. Il faut noter qu'en cette cause, le d\u00e9fendeur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 et entendu. Et voil\u00e0 bien ce qui la distingue fondamentalement de la pr\u00e9sente. Cette Cour, en \u00e9tant venue \u00e0 la conclusion que la Cour du Recorder avait err\u00e9 sur son interpr\u00e9tation de la loi, la revision de la d\u00e9cision par elle rendue d\u00e9pendait de la question de savoir si elle avait juridiction pour interpr\u00e9ter la loi comme elle l'avait fait, ou si sa juridiction d\u00e9pendait de la mauvaise interpr\u00e9tation qu'elle en fit. Et, ayant conclu dans le sens de la premi\u00e8re alternative, la Cour s'est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e incomp\u00e9tente \u00e0 maintenir le bref de prohibition et \u00e0 annuler une d\u00e9cision qui, pour la raison ci-dessus, aurait pu l'\u00eatre dans le cas d'un appel. En somme, ce pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent de Segal v. Cit\u00e9 de Montreal est pertinent \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration du premier, mais non du second moyen soulev\u00e9 par l'appelante en cette cause.\nEnfin, le fait que les formalit\u00e9s de la proc\u00e9dure pour obtenir le bref de prohibition ajoutent aux formalit\u00e9s de la proc\u00e9dure pour l'obtention d'un bref ordinaire, n'est pas en soi une objection ainsi qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par cette Cour dans Samson v. Drolet 40.\nJe maintiendrais l'appel, infirmerais le jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, d\u00e9clarerais qu'en d\u00e9cidant, le 21 janvier 1949, de r\u00e9voquer le certificat reconnaissant l'apelante comme agent n\u00e9gociateur de tous les instituteurs et institutrices qui enseignent le fran\u00e7ais dans le \u00e9coles fran\u00e7aises de la mise-en-cause, l'intim\u00e9e a agi sans juridiction et que telle d\u00e9cision, i.e., la r\u00e9vocation de ce certificat, est nulle et de nul effet; le tout avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les Cours contre l'intim\u00e9e.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Germain, Pigeon & Thibodeau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: J.

City of Vancouver, [1953] 2 S.C.R. 170\nDate: 1953-06-26\nJohn George MacDonald and Donald Arthur MacDonald, infants suing by their next friend John Louis MacDonald, And John Louis MacDonald (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\nand\nCity Of Vancouver and Jack Pinch (Defendants) Appellants;\n1953: May 11; 1953: May 12; 1953:June 26.\nPresent: Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand, Kellock and Locke JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nAutomobiles\u2014Negligence\u2014Mother fatally injured while riding in police car following ambulance conveying injured child to hospital\u2014Liability of city where no gross negligence\u2014Whether deceased transported as a passenger in the ordinary course of the business of the city\u2014Motor-vehicle Act R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 227, s. 82(b).\nSection 82 of the Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 227 exempts the owner or driver of a motor-vehicle from liability to a passenger by reason of the operation of the motor-vehicle, in the absence of gross negligence, but does not relieve \"any person to whose business the transportation of passengers is normally incidental, transporting a passenger in the ordinary course of the transporter's business\" from liability arising from the death of such passenger.\nThe plaintiff as next friend of his two infant sons, and on his own behalf, sued the City of Vancouver and the driver of a police car under the Families Compensation Act, R.S.B.C 1948, c. 116, for damages arising out of the death of his wife, the boys' mother. The latter was fatally injured when a member of Vancouver's Police Force, acting on the orders of his superior officer, was transporting the parents in a police car owned by the City, to a hospital to which a third child, injured in a traffic accident, was being conveyed in an ambulance. The action was tried before a jury, which in answer to questions, found that the defendant city was a person to whose business the transportation of passengers was normally incidental and that it was transporting the parents in the ordinary course of its business. It also found negligence but not gross negligence on the part of the driver of the police car, and awarded damages. The Court of Appeal for British Columbia set aside the judgment and dismissed the action.\nHeld: That there was no evidence to support the jury's finding that the parents in the circumstances of the case were being transported in the ordinary course of the city's business.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (1952-53) 7 W.W.R., affirmed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , O'Halloran J.A. dissenting, allowing the appeal of the respondents and setting aside the judgment of Macfarlane J. following a verdict of a jury awarding damages.\nC. K. Guild, Q.C. and M. G. Caple for the appellants.\nJ. W. de B. Farris, Q.C. for the respondents.\nKERWIN J.:\u2014The jury found that there was negligence on the part of the respondent Pinch which caused the accident and that such negligence consisted of excessive speed under the circumstances. That finding is not now in dispute. However, the jury also found that there was no gross negligence on his part and, therefore, under s. 82 of the British Columbia Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 227, no action lies for the death of Mrs. MacDonald unless the respondents fall within these words at the end of the section:\u2014\nbut the provisions of this section shall not relieve:\u2014\n***\n(b) Any person, to whose business the transportation of passengers is normally incidental, transporting a passenger in the ordinary course of the transporter's business,\u2014\nfrom liability for injury, loss, or damage to such passenger, or arising from the death of such passenger.\nIt was argued on behalf of the respondent City that the pleadings and the course of the trial showed plainly that the only business of the City suggested by the appellants was that of policing the municipality. Assuming, however, that the appellants are entitled to claim that anything that might be described as a business mentioned in the Vancouver charter constitutes the Municipality's business within (b), and without expressing an opinion on any other question, I find it impossible to say that transporting Mr. and Mrs. MacDonald was in the ordinary course of any such business. Not only was there no evidence upon which the jury could answer \"Yes\" to Question 2:\u2014 \"If your answer to Question 1 is 'Yes' was the City transporting Mr. and Mrs. MacDonald in the ordinary course of its business?\" but the evidence was all in the opposite sense. The appeal must be dismissed with costs if demanded. TASCHEREAU J.:\u2014This case arises out of an automobile accident which occurred in the City of Vancouver on July 18, 1950. On that date a four year old son of Mr. and Mrs. John G. MacDonald was run over by a truck in front of the MacDonald home, at 2295 Parker Street, in the City of Vancouver. An ambulance as well as two police cars were called to the scene of this accident, one of which was a \"beat\" car driven by Constable Jack Pinch who was accompanied by Constable Robert Gibson.\nPermission was refused to Mr. and Mrs. MacDonald to ride in the ambulance with the injured boy, on account of his critical condition, but authorization was given by the Police Traffic Sergeant to Pinch and Gibson to take the MacDonald's in their car. It is while following the ambulance to the hospital that the \"beat\" car went out of control, skidded and struck a tree, whereupon Mrs. MacDonald received severe injuries which caused her death.\nThe jury awarded $6,000 to the husband John G. MacDonald and $5,000 each to the two infants John G. and Donald A. MacDonald, and Mr. Justice MacFarlane accepted this verdict, and directed judgment to be entered accordingly. The Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice O'Halloran dissenting, allowed the appeal and dismissed the action with costs.\nThe law that has to be considered for the determination of this case, is s. 82 of the Motor-vehicle Act R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 227. The section reads:\u2014\n82. No action shall lie against either the owner or the driver of a motor-vehicle or of a motor-vehicle with a trailer attached by a person who is carried as a passenger in that motor-vehicle or trailer, or by his executor or administrator or by any person who is entitled to sue under the \"Families Compensation Act\", for any injury, loss, or damage sustained by such person or for the death of such person by reason of the operation of that motor-vehicle or of that motor-vehicle with trailer attached by the driver thereof while such person is a passenger on or is entering or alighting from that motor-vehicle or trailer, unless there has been gross negligence on the part of the driver of the vehicle and unless such gross negligence contributed to the injury, loss, or damage in respect of which the action is brought; but the provisions of this section shall not relieve:\u2014\n(a) Any person transporting a passenger for hire or gain; or\n(b) Any person, to whose business the transportation of passengers is normally incidental, transporting a passenger in the ordinary course of the transporters' business,\u2014\nfrom liability for injury, loss, or damage to such passenger, or arising from the death of such passenger. By its answer to question 5, the jury negatived gross negligence, so that the plaintiffs in order to succeed, must necessarily rely on the argument that the City of Vancouver came within subsection (b), and that it was a person, to whose business the transportation of passengers was normally incidental, and it was transporting Mrs. MacDonald in the ordinary course of its business.\nWith this proposition, I respectfully disagree. The business of municipal constables is to police the city, and protect the lives and property of its citizens. It is not a part of the city's business, and it is not \"normally incidental\" thereto, that the \"beat\" cars of the police force be used to transport passengers, as Mr. and Mrs. MacDonald have been, in the circumstances of this case. I find nothing in the City Charter and in the evidence to support the proposition of the appellants.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nRAND J.:\u2014Assuming that the City is a person \"to whose business the transportation of passengers is normally incidental\", and that as owner it would be responsible for the negligence of its police officers in operating the automobile in the circumstances here, on neither of which I express an opinion, that it was a carriage of a passenger \"in the ordinary course of the transporter's business\", is unsupported by anything in the case. It was an exceptional accommodation to the anxious parents of a child who had been injured and is not within the exception to s. 82 of the Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 227.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs if required.\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014The automobiles here concerned were both police cars and the evidence as to their use was limited to their use by the police. The first car, No. 4, a prowler or \"beat\" car, took the adult appellant and his wife from the scene of the first accident to the scene of the second, where Mrs. MacDonald was injured. No. 6, a traffic car, took them from there to the hospital. According to evidence which the jury could accept, the entry of the MacDonalds into each of the cars was on the orders of the police without any request on their part. It is argued by Mr. Farris that the mission of No. 6 was quite a different mission from that of No. 4 in that No. 6 was taking an injured person to the hospital accompanied by her husband, while No. 4 was taking two perfectly healthy people to the hospital in the wake of the ambulance carrying the child.\nHowever that may be, there is no magic in the words \"traffic\" and \"beat\" and it would seem that the appearance of No. 6 and the use to which it was put sufficiently indicates that the police considered it their business to use their cars for such purposes, while paragraph 16 of the statement of defence indicates that car No. 4 was equally employed in the performance of a proper police duty. In my opinion, on the evidence car No. 4 was engaged upon police \"business\" at the time of the accident here in question.\nThe question which arises in the first place, therefore, is whether this business can be said to be the business of the city within the meaning of s. 82 (b) of the Motor-vehicle Act. By virtue of the provisions of s. 253 of the city charter, however, jurisdictional limits are expressly marked off between the business of the city and the business of the police commission. In my opinion it cannot be said that what was done by either police car on the day in question fell within the scope of the business of the respondent, which, in relation to the police, is confined \"exclusively to the business and financial matters incident to the establishment, maintenance and upkeep of the police force\". On the other hand, the \"appointment, control, direction, supervision, discipline, and government\" of the force are exclusively matters within the jurisdiction of the commission. In that view the appeal should be dismissed, with costs, if demanded.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014In the appellant's statement of claim it is alleged that the late Ethel Elizabeth MacDonald, having been directed or ordered by the respondent Constable Pinch, or by Constable Gibson or Sergeant Abercrombie, to ride in a motor car owned by the respondent city to be conveyed to the Vancouver General Hospital, suffered injuries which resulted in her death by reason of the gross negligence in the driving and operation of the car by respondent Pinch. It was further alleged that the conveyance of Mrs. MacDonald was performed by one or other of the three constables above named:\u2014\nIn their business of the transportation of passengers normally incidental thereto, viz.: transportation of passengers in the ordinary course of their duty as police officers in the said motor vehicle as referred to under s. 82 of the Motor Vehicle Act and the said Act and regulations aforesaid.\nand that the automobile was at the time in question driven by Pinch, while in the employment of and in answering a police call of the City of Vancouver Police Department.\nThe allegation that the respondent city was the owner of the motor vehicle was not denied in the statement of defence and, as it appears to have been common ground between the parties throughout the course of this litigation that the city was to be regarded as the owner of the motor vehicle within the meaning of that word, as used in s. 81 of the Motor-vehicle Act (c. 227, R.S.B.C. 1948), we should not, in my opinion, consider the question as to the accuracy of this conclusion raised by the judgment of Mathers, C.J. in Bowles v. City of Winnipeg[2] at p. 496 et seq.\nAs the jury found, in answer to one of the questions submitted to them, that the manner in which Pinch drove the motor car was negligent but that it had not been grossly negligent, the appellants were forced to rely upon their contention that the city was a person to whose business the transportation of passengers is normally incidental and that the accident occurred while it was engaged in transporting the passenger in the ordinary course of the transport business, within the meaning of s. 82 of the Motor-vehicle Act.\nThe statement of claim and the evidence given at the trial make it clear that the business of the city, to which it was contended that the transportation of passengers was normally incidental, was that of policing the streets. It was the \"transportation of passengers in the ordinary course of their duty as police officers\" as to which the negligence was alleged. The answer to the appellant's claim is that the Chief Constable and all the constables and members of the Police Force of the City are appointed by the Board of Police Commissioners, constituted under the provisions of s. 253 of the Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921, as amended, to which Board of control, direction, supervision, discipline and government are given by the statute. Members of the Police Force are directed by s-s. 10 of s. 253 to obey the lawful directions and be subject to the discipline and government of the Board and are charged with special duties of preventing infractions of by-laws of the city, preserving the peace, preventing crime and apprehending offenders, and are stated to have generally all the powers and privileges and be liable to all the duties and responsibilities which belong by law to the constables. Constable Pinch was directed by his superior, Sergeant Abercrombie, to drive the appellant John L. MacDonald and his wife to the hospital and it was in the course of what he undoubtedly considered to be his duty as a police officer that he was driving the car at the time of the accident. He was neither acting nor assuming to act on behalf of the City of Vancouver, or engaged in any of its business. If the City of Vancouver engages in any business to which the transportation of passengers is normally incidental, it is not in connection with the performance of the duties imposed upon the Board of Police Commissioners and the members of the Police Force by the statute.\nWhile the question is not raised by the pleadings in the present action, the liability asserted being qua owner, it may be noted that in Bowles v. Winnipeg, above referred to, was held that neither the City of Winnipeg nor the Board of Police Commissioners was liable for the negligence of a police constable appointed by the Board and acting under its orders. Further authority on this aspect of the matter may be found in Wishart v. City of Brandon[3] ; Winterbottom v. Board of Commisisoners of Police of the City of London[4] ; and McCleave v. City of Moncton[5] .\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs if demanded.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, if demanded.\nSolicitor for the appellants: M. G. Caple.\nSolicitors for the respondents: W.

The road was straight and the visibility clear. The victim was in a coma from the date of the accident to the date of his death which occurred one year later. There was evidence that during that period he reacted only to pain from stimuli. The trial judge found the driver of the truck solely to blame and awarded $10,000 general damages. The Court of Appeal for Alberta upheld the finding of negligence but reduced the general damages to $7,500.\nHeld: Following the principle set down in Anglo-Newfoundland Development Co. v. Pacific Steam Navigation Co. ([1924] A.C. 406), the sole cause of the accident was the negligence of the driver of the truck.\nHeld: The principles to be followed in fixing damages under this head being as set down in Benham v. Gambling ([1941] A.C. 157), which was presumably followed in this case by the Appellate Division, the latter's adjudication should stand. If there was anything included therein for pain and suffering, the maxim de minimus non curat lex applied. APPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division 1, dismissing an appeal from the judgment at trial in an action for damages.\nH. W. Riley Q.C. and J. R. McColough for the appellant.\nS. H. McCuaig Q.C. for the respondents Harvie and Osbaldeston.\nC. W. Clement Q.C. and W. R. Sinclair for the respondent Bechthold.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKerwin J.:\u2014The position in this appeal on the question of liability is that put by Lord Shaw in Anglo-Newfoundland Development Co. v. Pacific Steam Navigation Co. 2:\nAnd I take the principle to be that, although there might be\u2014which for the purpose of this point I am reckoning there was\u2014fault in being in a position which makes an accident possible yet, if the position is recognized by the other prior to operations which result in an accident occurring, the author of that accident is the party who, recognizing the position of the other, fails negligently to avoid an accident which with reasonable conduct on his part, could have been avoided. Unless that principle be applied it would be always open to a person negligently and recklessly approaching, and failing to avoid a known danger, to plead that the reckless encountering of danger was contributed to by the fact that there was a danger to be encountered.\nThe trial judge found that Bechthold's car was stationary and, in effect, that Gibson saw that to be so, and his judgment was approved unanimously by the Appellate Division 3. Mr. Riley has said all that was possible on the point but he has not convinced me that the concurrent judgments in the Courts below should be set aside. Without reference to the signals either by Bechthold or Gibson and assuming that Bechthold was negligent in proceeding to the south side of the road, it was Gibson's negligence that was the sole cause of the accident.\nThere still remains the question of damages. We are concerned only with the amount awarded the plaintiff Albert Osbaldeston as administrator of his son Marvin Harold Osbaldeston. The trial judge, Mr. Justice Egbert allowed $13,000 and it is admitted that of that amount $3,000 represents special damages. The remaining $10,000 was awarded in accordance with the principles the trial judge had previously enunciated in Maltais v. C.P.R.4. There he had adopted as correct the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Adamson in the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Anderson v. Chasney 5, in whose conclusion on this particular topic Mr. Justice Coyn had agreed. There was an appeal to this Court in that case 6, which was dismissed but the question of damages was not in issue. Mr. Justice Adamson departed from the principles set forth by the House of Lords in Benham v. Gambling 7. In Manitoba, as in Alberta, there is a statutory provision which in the latter province is found in the Trustee Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 215, s. 32:\u2014\n32. The executors or administrators of any deceased person may maintain an action for all torts or injuries to the person or to the real or personal estate of the deceased except in cases of libel and slander in the same manner and with the same rights and remedies as the deceased would if living have been entitled to do; and the damages when recovered shall form part of the personal estate of the deceased; but such action shall be brought within one year after his decease.\nI am unable to perceive any difference in substance between this provision and that in England whereby all causes of action vested in a person shall survive for the benefit of his estate.\nContrary to what had been considered to be the law in practically every jurisdiction where similar provisions existed, a claim for what may be described as damages for shortened expectation of life, was upheld by the House of Lords in Rose v. Ford 8. As a result, particularly in England, excessive damages were from time to time awarded under such a head and it was in an effort to offset that tendency that the House of Lords decided Benham v. Gambling. With the consent of counsel on both sides, the tables of expectation of life periodically prepared by the Registrar General had been placed before the trial judge but Viscount Simon, delivering the judgment of the House of Lords, stated that the trial judge had observed that these tables \"are not really evidence in a matter of this kind.\" Viscount Simon considered that this statistical material was not of assistance in such a case as the one before the House but I take it that this was because the child in respect of whose death its father and administrator had brought the action was but two and one-half years of age. Later in his speech Viscount Simon acknowledged that the age of the individual might in some cases be a relevant factor but that \"arithmetical calculations are to be avoided, if only for the reason that it is of no assistance to know how many years have been lost, unless one knows how to put a value on the years.\" It was pointed out that all lives are not uniformly happy and that the thing to be valued was not the prospect of length of days but the prospect of a predominantly happy life. It is generally recognized that infants are subject to children's diseases, which in many cases prove fatal, and the House of Lords therefore felt justified in reducing the amount of damages allowed by the trial judge.\nIn Anderson v. Chasney, Mr. Justice Adamson seemed to consider that the Benham judgment should not be followed in Canada because of the difference in conditions here and in England. While differences do exist, they may be taken into account without departing from the ratio of the House of Lords decision. He also appeared to think that Viscount Simon's statement that \"compensation is not being given to the person who was injured at all\" was opposed to the provision in the Manitoba Trustee Act that such an action may be brought \"as if the representative were the deceased in life.\" I am satisfied that the members of the House of Lords who took part in the judgment in Benham v. Gambling meant only that while the matter was to be treated as if the representative were the deceased in life, any compensation would in fact go to those entitled on an intestacy or under a testamentary disposition. Furthermore, an allowance is not made to compensate the parents, or either of them, for money spent to rear a son or daughter as Mr. Justice Adamson's statement on page 369 of the report in Anderson v. Chaseney might indicate.\nIf the matter were left in this position, the award of Mr. Justice Egbert could not stand. However, the Appelate Division reduced the amount awarded by $2,500. There was no difference on this point among the members of that Court, the main judgment of whom was delivered by Mr. Justice Parlee. Previously he had delivered the reasons for judgment on behalf of the Appellate Division in Kirschman v. Nichols 9. There, in fixing damages under this head, he referred to a number of cases, among which was Benham v. Gambling, thus indicating that the Appellate Division was following the House of Lords decision.\nUnder these circumstances and bearing in mind the depreciation in the value of money, this Court should not interfere with the amount fixed by the highest provincial court unless Mr. Riley is correct in his contention that that adjudication cannot stand in view of the following statement in the reasons of Mr. Justice Parlee:\u2014 \"It is, I think, fair to say that there is evidence that the deceased did suffer pain; in any event, such should not be excluded in determining the amount to be awarded the administrator under the Trustee Act.\" The accident occurred on June 10, 1950, and Osbaldeston died June 16, 1951. The medical evidence was by consent given in the form of written reports. Dr. Stevens reported on February 15, 1951, that Osbaldeston \"has not regained consciousness though he does react somewhat to external stimuli such as pain and spoken word. He has moved his arms and legs slightly but only as an involuntary response to stimulus.\" Dr. Gordon first saw the patient on June 13, 1950, and had him under observation until he was transferred from Macleod Hospital to the University Hospital in Edmonton on July 11, 1950. Dr. Gordon reported:\u2014 \"He responded only to most painful stimuli.\" There is also the evidence of the deceased's father who saw his son frequently and who testified as follows:\u2014\nQ. Did he ever show signs of recognition?\u2014A. At times he did.\nQ. Were you satisfied that he recognized you?\u2014A. Well, we liked to make ourselves believe that he knew us, although he never said anything, he never spoke.\nIt is clear that the deceased was always in a coma and, therefore, if he suffered any pain it would not be to the same extent as one who was in full possession of all his faculties. In his claim for damages, the father, and administrator of Marvin Harold Osbaldeston, did not include anything for pain and suffering of his son and in fact counsel disclaimed any such pretension. Particularly in view of the extract from the reasons of Mr. Justice Parlee quoted above, I am satisfied that the Appellate Division realized that the only possible evidence under this head was as I have indicated and anything included in the award finally made should be treated by this Court as within the maxim de minimus non curat lex.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs and the cross-appeal without costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nCross-Appeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Macleod, Riley, McDermid, Bessemer & Dixon.\nSolicitors for Respondents: Osbaldeston and Harvie: McGuaig, Parsons & McGuaig.\nSolicitors for Respondent Bechthold: Smith, Clement, Parlee & Whittaker.\n1 [1952-53] 7 W.W.R.

At a hearing before the Board counsel for the respondent sought to cross-examine the union secretary to show that since the filing of the application a number of the employees had resigned. On the ground that this matter was irrevelant, the Board refused permission and also refused to question the witness itself, to examine the documents filed, or to order a vote of the employees in question, and granted certification.

KERWIN J.\u2014By leave of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the Toronto Newspaper Guild, Local 87, American Newspaper Guild (CIO) appeals from a judgment of that Court affirming an order of Gale J. The latter had granted an application by the respondent Globe Printing Company by way of certiorari for an order bringing into the Supreme Court of Ontario and quashing a certificate of the Ontario Labour Relations Board dated July 20, 1950. That certificate recited that the appellant\u2019s application for certification as a bargaining agent had come on for hearing in the presence of representatives of the parties; that the Board had satisfied itself that the appellant was a trade union within the meaning of the Regulations made under The Labour Relations Act, 1948, of the Province of Ontario, that all employees in the respondent\u2019s Circulation Department, with certain named exceptions, constituted a unit appropriate for collective bargaining, and that a majority of such employees were members in good standing of the appellant. The Board then proceeded to certify that the appellant was the certified bargaining agent of such employees. While the Board\u2019s proceedings were attacked on various grounds stated in the notice of motion, in my view it is necessary to consider only one, i.e., that the Board had exceeded its jurisdiction.\nIt is important to emphasize immediately one matter referred to in the reasons for judgment of Chief Justice Robertson, speaking on behalf of the Court of Appeal. In the Province of Ontario certiorari may be granted upon a summary application by originating notice (Rule 622), and no writ of certiorari shall be issued but all the necessary provisions shall be made in the judgment or order (Rule 623), and a form of order (82) is provided in these words:\u2014\n\u201cUpon the application of , and upon reading the affidavit of filed, and upon hearing the solicitor (or counsel) for .\n1. It is ordered that do send to the Registrar\u2019s Office at Osgoode Hall, Toronto (or as may be necessary) forthwith (or on the day of ) the , with all things touching the same, as fully and entirely as they remain in his custody, together with this order, that this Court may further cause to be done thereupon what it shall see fit to be done.\u201d There would appear to be no doubt that if in any case the Court considered that \u201call things touching the same, as fully and entirely as they remain in his custody\u201d had not been sent, the Court could remit the return to the inferior tribunal for completion. In the present case no return was made because, as the Chief Justice points out, the original of the Board\u2019s certicate was deposited with the Registrar of the Court by officers of the appellant, apparently after the delivery of judgment by Gale J. Affidavits were filed on behalf of the respondent on its motion for certiorari and in addition to making a copy of the Board\u2019s certificate an exhibit, the affidavits set out what had occurred at the hearing. It should be taken that the affidavits and exhibit referred to constituted the record as if it had been formally returned by the Board. Certiorari will lie if the Board exceeded its jurisdiction, and I understand that proposition is not denied.\nThe Board was established pursuant to s-s. 1 of s. 2 of the Act, and by s-s. 2 thereof the Board was authorized to exercise such powers and perform such duties as might be vested in or imposed upon it by the Act or the regulations made thereunder. By s-s. 7, 8 and 9 of s. 3:\u2014\n(7) The Board and each member thereof shall have the power of summoning any person and requiring him to give evidence on oath before the Board and to produce such documents and things as may be deemed requisite for the full investigation of any matter coming before the Board and shall have the like power to enforce the attendance of witnesses and to compel them to give evidence and to produce documents and things as is vested in any court in civil cases.\n(8) The Board and each member thereof may receive and accept such evidence and information on oath, affidavit or otherwise as in its or his discretion it or he may deem fit and proper whether admissible as evidence in a court of law or not.\n(9) Subject to the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, the Board may make rules governing its procedure which are not inconsistent with the regulations and may by such rules provide for the taking of votes on the premises of employers during working hours.\nBy section 4:\u2014\n4. If in any proceeding before the Board a question arises as to whether,\u2014\n. . .\n(h) a person is a member in good standing of a trade union,\nthe Board shall decide the question and, subject to such right of appeal as may be provided by the regulations, its decision shall be final and conclusive. No applicable right of appeal is provided by the regulations. S. 5 provides:\u2014\n5. Subject to such right of appeal as may be provided by the regulations, the orders, decisions and rulings of the Board shall be final and shall not be questioned or reviewed nor shall any proceeding before the Board be removed, nor shall the Board be restrained, by injunction, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, certiorari or otherwise by any court, but the Board may, if it considers it advisable to do so, reconsider any decision or order made by it and may vary or revoke any such decision or order.\nPursuant to the Act, regulations were made by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. The appellant is a trade union as defined by regulation 1(1) (o), and under regulation 1(3) the Circulation Department of the respondent is a unit appropriate for collective bargaining Regulation 3(1) provides:\u2014\n3. (1) Every employee has the right to be a member of a trade union and to participate in the activities thereof.\nParagraph 1 of regulation 4 reads in part:\u2014\n4. (1) No employer or employers\u2019 organization and no person acting on behalf of an employer or employers\u2019 organization, shall participate in or interfere with the formation or administration of a trade union, or contribute financial or other support to it.\nRegulation 7(1) provides:\u2014\n7. (1) A trade union claiming to have as members in good standing a majority of employees of one or more employers in a unit that is appropriate for collective bargaining may, subject to the rules of procedure of the Board and in accordance with this regulation, make application to the Board to be certified as bargaining agent of the employees in the unit.\nand in accordance therewith the appellant filed with the Board an application to be certified as the bargaining agent of the employees (with certain exceptions) of the respondent\u2019s Circulation Department. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 of regulation 9 read as follows:\u2014\n9. (1) Where a trade union makes application for certification under these regulations as bargaining agent of employees in a unit, the Board, in determining whether the unit in respect of which the application is made is appropriate for collective bargaining, may, before certification, if it deems it appropriate to do so, include additional employees in, or exclude employees from, the unit, and shall take such steps as it deems appropriate to determine the wishes of the employees in the units as to the selection of a bargaining agent to act on their behalf.\n(2) When, pursuant to an application for certification under these regulations by a trade union, the Board has determined that a unit of employees is appropriate for collective bargaining.\n(a) if the Board is satisfied that the majority of the employees in the unit are members in good standing of the trade union; or (b) if, as a result of a vote of the employees in the unit, the Board is satisfied that a majority of them have selected the trade union to be a bargaining agent on their behalf;\nthe Board may certify the trade union as the bargaining agent of the employees in the unit.\n(4) The Board may, for the purposes of determining whether the majority of the employees in a unit are members in good standing of a trade union or whether a majority of them have selected a trade union to be their bargaining agent, make or cause to be made such examination of records or other inquiries as it deems necessary.\nBy regulation 11 the Board has power to revoke a certificate where in its opinion a bargaining agent no longer represents a majority of employees in the unit for which it was certified.\nPursuant to s. 3(9) of the Act, the Board made rules which were approved by the Lieutenant\u2011Governor-in-Council. In accordance with these rules the application by the appellant for certification as a bargaining agent for the employees (with certain exceptions) in the respondent\u2019s Circulation Department said to number 80, was verified by affidavit, and notice of the filing of application was given to the respondent. Also in conformity with the rules the respondent filed its reply, verified by affidavit. In this reply, after giving as 93 the number of employees in the unit, claimed by the respondent to be suitable for collective bargaining, paragraph 11 stated:\u2014\n\u201c11. Any other relevant facts:\nThe Respondent respectfully requests that the Board determine if the Applicant represents a majority of the Respondent\u2019s employees within the appropriate bargaining unit herein as members in good standing within the meaning of the Regulations of the Board.\nThe Respondent further requests that this Board direct and conduct a vote by secret ballot of said employees in order to conclusively determine if they desire to be represented by the Applicant in their collective dealings with the Respondent.\nRule 12 provides:\u2014\n12. After the expiration of the time for receiving a report or for filing reply, intervention or statement of objections, as the case may be, the Registrar shall serve a notice of hearing in form 17 upon each of the parties to the proceeding, not less than 7 clear days from the date fixed in the notice.\nand in accordance therewith the Registrar gave the respondent the prescribed notice (Form 17) of the hearing of the appellant\u2019s application. Under the regulations and rules the Board was therefore obliged to conduct a hearing upon that application and, when it had determined that the Circulation Department was appropriate for certified bargaining, then, by regulation 9(2) (a):-\n(a) if the Board is satisfied that the majority of the employees in the unit are members in good standing of the trade union;\n(b)\u2026the Board may certify the trade union as the bargaining agent of the employees in the unit.\nDisregarding paragraph (b), since the Board refused to order a vote as requested by the respondent, this means that the Board\u2019s jurisdiction to certify depended upon its being satisfied that the majority of the employees in the Circulation Department were members in good standing of the appellant Union. But the Board said that it was irrelevant whether certain individuals had resigned from the Union and it therefore declined to investigate that all important question. In proceeding to certify, it exceeded its jurisdiction and excess of jurisdiction has invariably been held to be a ground upon which a Superior Court could quash an order of an inferior tribunal.\nWe start with the proposition that when an administrative tribunal has been set up by a paramount legislative body it is the intention that such tribunal keep within the powers conferred upon it. In England and in Canada the decisions have been uniform that a Superior Court is invested with the power and duty of seeing that such a tribunal as the Ontario Labour Relations Board does not act without jurisdiction.\nAlthough a case of mandamus, the decision and reasoning in The Queen v. Marsham[3], is instructive. The clerk to the Lewisham Board of Works having been called before a magistrate to prove the execution of certain works and the amount of an apportionment, the applicants desired to cross-examine him as to whether the whole sum expended was paving expenses. The magistrate agreed with the contention of the Board that the apportionment of their surveyor could not be questioned, and refused to allow the clerk to be cross-examined or substantive evidence to be given by the applicants upon the point. An ex parte application for an order nisi for a mandamus had been refused by a Divisional Court but was subsequently granted by the Court of Appeal. Upon cause being shown, the Court consisting of Lord Halsbury L.C., Lord Esher M.R. and Fry and Lopes L.JJ., made the rule absolute. At page 375 Lord Halsbury stated that the act of the magistrate was not a mere rejection of evidence but amounted to a declining to enter upon an inquiry on which he was bound to enter. Lord Esher, at 378, having stated that the application for a mandamus was made upon the ground that the magistrate declined to exercise the jurisdiction given him by law, continues:\u2014\nNow, the form in which he is said to have declined jurisdiction is, that he refused to hear certain evidence which was tendered before him, and it is suggested on behalf of the board that such refusal, at the most, only amounted to wrongful refusal to receive evidence, and not to a declining of jurisdiction. The distinction between the two is sometimes rather nice; but it is plain that a judge may wrongly refuse to hear evidence upon either of two grounds: one, that even if received the evidence would not prove the subject-matter which the judge was bound to inquire into; the other, that whether the evidence would prove the subject-matter or not, the subject-matter itself was one into which he had no jurisdiction to inquire. In the former case the judge would be wrongly refusing to receive evidence, but would not be refusing jurisdiction, as he would in the latter. Here the magistrate does not say that the evidence tendered would not prove the fact that the claim of the board included matters outside the statute; he has refused to hear the evidence, even though it would prove that fact; he has, therefore, declined jurisdiction.\nThe other two members of the Court concurred.\nLord Esher\u2019s judgment, I think, sets forth the test to determine whether there be, in any particular case, a mere rejection of evidence or a refusal of jurisdiction. There is nothing inconsistent in it and the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Rex v. Nat Bell Liquors,[4]; but I might point out two things in connection with the latter. When the occasion arises, it may be necessary to read it in the light of the judgment of Lord Goddard, speaking on behalf of the King\u2019s Bench Division in Rex v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal[5], affirmed by the Court of Appeal[6]; and that we are not concerned with the applicability of the Nat Bell judgment to a motion \u201cto quash a conviction, order, warrant or inquisition\u201d as those words are used in s. 65 of the Ontario Judicature Act, R S.O. 1950, c. 190. The decision in Nat Bell was that a conviction by a magistrate for an offence under the Alberta Liquor Act could not be quashed on the ground that the depositions showed that there was no evidence to support the conviction or that the magistrate had misdirected himself in considering the evidence. The decision in Rex v. Murphy[7], relied on by the appellant, is referred to in the Nat Bell case at 152 where it is said that it appears from the very full and able discussion of all the authorities therein:\u2014\nTo say that there is no jurisdiction to convict without evidence is the same thing as saying that there is jurisdiction if the decision is right, and none if it is wrong; or that jurisdiction at the outset of a case continues so long as the decision stands, but that, if it is set aside, the real conclusion is that there never was any jurisdiction at all.\nThe Irish case is distinguishable because while there had been a refusal at a court-martial to allow cross-examination of two witnesses it was held that the court-martial had jurisdiction.\nThe judgment of the Judicial Committee in Wilson v. Esquimalt Railway Co.[8], was also relied upon by the appellant. There an action had been brought by the Railway Company to establish its title to coal and other minerals underlying certain lands on Vancouver Island and for a declaration that a grant authorized by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of British Columbia was null and void. The latter was given power, if he was reasonably satisfied of certain conditions, to direct the issuance of the grant, and it was held by the Judicial Committee that a court of law, dealing with actions of the Executive, could not say that there was no evidence upon which it could be so satisfied. That conclusion was arrived at notwithstanding the fact that the Privy Council, while thereby disagreeing with the trial judge and the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, agreed with the majority of the latter that no complaint could be made of the circumstance that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council declined to adjourn the hearing before him in order to permit the Railway Company to cross\u2011examine certain deponents. The decision on this last point was particularly relied upon by counsel for the appellant but it might be pointed out that it was only necessary that the Lieutenant Governor in Council be reasonably satisfied of the conditions specified. Sections similar to s. 5 of the Act, although differing in form, have been enacted by legislative bodies from time to time but it is unnecessary to set forth the decisions in which they have been considered because, if jurisdiction has been exceeded, such a section cannot avail to protect an order of the Board; and I understood that to be conceded by counsel for the appellant. Since in my view the Board exceeded its jurisdiction, s. 4 of the Act, also relied upon by counsel for the appellant, does not assist him. Finally, it is stated in the Board\u2019s reasons, which I hold to be a part of the return, that the Board \u201cfurther finds on the basis of the documentary evidence submitted by the parties.\u201d There is nothing to justify the suggestion that the Board, or any member thereof, was even purporting to act under the provisions of s\u2011s. 7 or 8 of s. 3, or that they had any evidence other than the Union records placed before it by the appellant.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRAND J. (dissenting): The complaint here is that the courts have exceeded their authority in setting aside an order of the Labor Board certifying a bargaining agent for a group of employees in Toronto. The immediate question involved a finding by the Board that the required number of persons employed within the unit were members of the applicant union. On the hearing, the employer raised the question of resignations made prior to the hearing but subsequently to the filing of the application, and on this he was denied the right to cross\u2011examine a representative of the union who was present and had submitted undisclosed evidence to the Board. The reason given by the Board, after considerable argument, was that the matter proposed was irrelevant. During the discussion, counsel made a reference to the constitution of the union, implying that in some way it affected the issue raised. There had been placed before the Board, evidently, the application cards for memberships, but in accordance with its practice these were not shown to counsel for the employer. There may have been no objection to placing the constitution before the Board at the hearing, but it was neither asked for nor produced, nor did the Board in its decision refer to it. By s. 4 of The Labour Relations Act, 1948, where a question is raised whether \u201ca person is a member in good standing of a trade union\u201d, the Board shall decide it, and, subject to such right of appeal as may be provided by the regulations, its decision shall be final and conclusive. S. 7 authorizes the Lieutenant-Governor in Council among other things to make regulations generally for carrying out provisions of the Act into effect but no regulation has been passed giving a right of appeal.\nS. 5 enforces this conclusiveness by providing that subject to any such right of appeal,\nthe orders, decisions and rulings of the Board shall be final and shall not be questioned or reviewed, nor shall any proceeding before the Board be removed, nor shall the Board be restrained by injunction, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, certiorari or otherwise by any court;\nbut the Board may reconsider any decision or order made.\nBy s. 3 s-s. (3) each member of the Board must take an oath to execute his office \u201cfaithfully, truly and impartially\u201d and that he will not, except in the discharge of his duties, \u201cdisclose to any person any of the evidence or any other matter brought before\u201d the Board. By s-s. (8) the Board and each member of it \u201cmay receive and accept such evidence and information on oath, affidavit or otherwise as in its or his discretion it or he may deem fit and proper, whether admissible as evidence in a court of law or not.\u201d\nS. 9 excludes certain classes of employees such as those engaged in farming, members of a police force and of a fire department within the meaning of certain statutes, and employees of municipal corporations, including school boards, having certain statutory powers.\nRegulations were made and several of them bear upon the issue. By No. 9(2), upon an application for certification of a union as the bargaining agent of employees in a unit,\n(a) If the Board is satisfied that the majority of the employees in the unit are members in good standing of the trade union.\nthe Board may certify accordingly. Then, in (4) of the same regulation,\nThe Board may, for the purposes of determining whether the majority of the employees in a unit are members in good standing\u2026 make or cause to be made such examination of records or other inquiries as it deems necessary. The statute provides in s. 3 s-s. (9) that\nSubject to the approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, the Board may make rules governing its procedure which are not inconsistent with the regulations.\nExercising this power, the Board promulgated, as rule 12, the following:\u2014\nAfter the expiration of the time for receiving the report or for filing reply, intervention or statement of objections, as the case may be, the Registrar shall serve a notice of hearing in Form 17 upon each of the parties to the proceeding, not less than seven clear days from the date fixed in the notice.\nThis is the only reference in either the statute, the regulations or the rules, to a hearing.\nS. 9 of the Act on its face contains the seeds of questions of law of some importance and set against s. 5, they present the appearance of conflicting provisions. The Board is admittedly a body with a limited jurisdiction, but a jurisdiction that, in many cases, depends upon the determination of questions of law as well as of fact. There is nothing in the Act expressly giving to the Board exclusive power to decide questions of law; but the writ of certiorari and other special remedies, for centuries the means provided for controlling unauthorized action by inferior bodies exercising the power of law, are forbidden.\nHow, then, are we to reconcile these apparent contradictions? Every such enactment, consciously or subconsciously, lies with a general and vague but nonetheless real scope of action within which the body created is contemplated and intended by the legislature to act; and the privative provision, s. 5, is designed to exclude the control of the courts within that area. In the absence of a clear expression to the contrary, we are bound by the principle that ultra vires action is a matter for the superior courts: the statute is enacted on that assumption. Any other view would mean that the legislature intended to authorize the tribunal to act as it pleased, subject only to legislative supervision: but that is within neither our theory of legislation nor the provisions of our constitution. The acquiescence of the legislatures, particularly during the past fifty years, in the rejection by the courts of such a view confirms the interpretation which has consistently been given to the privative clause. The real controversy lies in the determination of the boundaries of that contemplated scope; and when, as today, administrative bodies are regulating civil relations which formerly were not within the cognizance of law at all, by what rule or standard are we to test the jurisdictional validity of their decisions? Certainly where the Board is at liberty to inform itself of matters of fact by any means, as it is here, and where it can act if \u201csatisfied\u201d of certain things and where its findings are declared to be final and judicial review excluded, I doubt that the test can be anything less than this: is the action or decision within any rational compass that can be attributed to the statutory language? It is significant here that neither the statute nor the regulations make any reference to a hearing; that step, as has been seen, arises only by way of implication from procedural rules. But assuming such a right, it has been entrusted with so many qualifying powers in the Board that its ordinary function has been virtually emasculated. It is reduced to an opportunity for each side to present its own evidence unilaterally and by its own means only; but even to that extent, in many respects, it is a disclosure to the Board only. There are, undoubtedly, matters affecting interests on which information privately obtained may be more accessible and quite as dependable as any disclosed at a hearing; and seeing that the Board is entitled to the presumption that it acts in good faith and according to the oath of each member, in the simple matter of finding facts, it must be little short of an act of bad faith that can justify a court\u2019s interference.\nI am fully appreciative of the fact that the safety of permitting action based upon information gathered in the dark depends upon the integrity and the intelligence of those on whom the authority is conferred, and that such a method clashes with the lessons of our law\u2019s experience; the best means to truth remain those of open disclosure of the facts. Yet on both sides of these controversies we have the strongest insistence upon the secrecy of what is called \u201cconfidential\u201d matter. We need not be warned of the dangers of a hugger-mugger procedure generally; the open public court is the citadel of our legal system. Authority to make decisions on matters undisclosed to both sides is the first step toward arbitrary judgment, the final stage of which, if allowed to be pursued, is dictation.\nBut decisions of this nature on matters of fact and erroneous rulings in the course of a hearing are not, under this statute, for the courts; it is to the legislature that complaints against them must be addressed. It is to no purpose that judicial minds may be outraged by seemingly arbitrary if not irrational treatment of questions raised: these views are irrelevant where there is no clear departure from the field of action defined by the statute.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the order of the Board with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Kellock, Estey and Locke, JJ. was delivered by:\nKELLOCK J.: The facts out of which this appeal arises are as follows. On June 7, 1950, the appellant made application in writing, pursuant to regulation 7 under The Labour Relations Act, 1948 (Ontario), to be certified as bargaining agent for certain employees of the respondent, the appellant claiming that\nthe applicant union has a majority of the employees in the Circulation Department as members in good standing.\nThe regulations empower the board established under the Act to grant certification if \u201csatisfied\u201d that the majority of the employees in a \u201cunit appropriate for collective bargaining\u201d are members in good standing of an applicant trade union. By s. 4 of the statute it is provided that, if in any proceeding \u201cbefore\u201d the board a question arises as to whether\n(h) a person is a member in good standing of a trade union.\nthe board is to decide the question, such decision to be final and conclusive.\nCertification affects substantial legal rights of both employer and employee. Regulation 10 reads:\n10. Where a trade union is certified under the Act or these regulations as the bargaining agent of the employees in a unit\n(a) The trade union shall immediately replace any other bargaining agent of employees in the unit and shall have exclusive authority to bargain collectively on behalf of employees in the unit and to bind them by a collective agreement until the certification of the trade union in respect of employees in the unit is revoked; (b) if another trade union had previously been certified as bargaining agent in respect of employees in the unit, the certification of the last-mentioned trade union shall be deemed to be revoked in respect of such employees; and\n(c) if, at the time of certification, a collective agreement binding on or entered into on behalf of employees in the unit is in force, the trade union shall be substituted as a party to the agreement in place of the bargaining agent that is a party to the agreement on behalf of employees in the unit, and may, notwithstanding anything contained in the agreement, upon two months\u2019 notice to the employer terminate the agreement in so far as it applies to those employees.\nThe application was, as required by rule 3(2) of the rules made by the board, verified by the affidavit of the secretary of the appellant, and, as required by the rules, written notice of its filing was, on June 9th, duly given to the respondent by the registrar of the board.\nBy its reply, dated June 15th, the respondent requested the board to determine \u201cif the applicant represents a majority of the respondent\u2019s employees within the appropriate bargaining unit as members in good standing\u201d.\nSubsequently, on June 28th, the registrar caused to be served upon the board, pursuant to the rules, a notice of hearing of the application for July 12th. Rule 13 provides that\nwhere any person served with a notice of hearing fails to attend upon the hearing or any adjournment thereof, the Board may proceed in its absence.\nThe statute contains provisions which indicate the nature of the hearing to be conducted \u201cbefore\u201d the board. S. 3 provides that\n(7) The Board and each member thereof shall have the power of summoning any person and requiring him to give evidence on oath before the Board and to produce such documents and things as may be deemed requisite for the full investigation of any matter coming before the Board and shall have the like power to enforce the attendance of witnesses and to compel them to give evidence and to produce documents and things as is vested in any court in civil cases.\n(8) The Board and each member thereof may receive and accept such evidence and information on oath, affidavit or otherwise as in its or his discretion it or he may deem fit and proper whether admissible as evidence in a court of law or not. In Board of Education v. Rice,[9] the House of Lords laid down principles which apply to a tribunal of the nature of that here in question. At page 182 Lord Loreburn L.C., said that in such cases the tribunal\nmust act in good faith and fairly listen to both sides, for that is a duty lying upon every one who decides anything.\nAfter pointing out the power of the board there in question to obtain information in any way it thought best (a much wider power than the power provided by s-s (8) above quoted), the Lord Chancellor went on to state that in so doing it must always be upon\ngiving a fair opportunity to those who are parties in the controversy for correcting or contradicting any relevant statement prejudicial to their view\u2026 But if the Court is satisfied either that the Board have not acted judicially in the way I have described, or have not determined the question which they are required by the Act to determine, then there is a remedy by mandamus and certiorari.\nThese principles were again affirmed in Local Government Board v. Arlidge,[10].\nWhen the matter here in question came on for hearing on July 12th, the matter of the composition of the bargaining unit having been disposed of, the board proceeded to deal with the claim of the appellant to have a majority of the employees in its membership. Counsel for the appellant stated to the board that appellant claimed to have fifty-nine members and filed with the board a bundle of documents which he stated represented fifty-six members who had paid initiation fees or dues, and one other document stated to represent a member who had mailed a card to the secretary of the appellant without enclosing any money for initiation fees or membership dues, but who subsequently, on request of the secretary of the appellant, had sent the latter $1.00. Counsel further stated that the recording sheets of the applicant union for the month of June, 1950, showed fifty-eight members. The secretary of the appellant, who, as already mentioned, had taken the affidavit of verification of the petition, then made an unsworn statement concerning the document representing the member who had sent in his fee subsequently. The board thereupon requested counsel for the respondent to produce and file lists of employees in its circulation department, showing the occupational classification of individual employees, as required by a requisition previously sent by the registrar of the board to the respondent. Counsel for the respondent thereupon filed lists of employees of the department as of the 7th of June, 1950 and the 5th of July, 1950, as had been requested.\nCounsel for the respondent then submitted to the board that the documents filed by counsel for the appellant did not show that the appellant represented a majority of members in good standing and that he wished to cross-examine the secretary of the appellant who had given evidence. In response to a question from the chairman as to the purpose of his submission and of the proposed cross-examination, counsel stated that he had information that a number of employees in the department in question had sent in their resignations as members of the appellant. The chairman stated, however, that \u201che saw no relevancy to resignations.\u201d\nSome argument then took place by both counsel in which counsel for the respondent pointed out that to refuse the respondent the right to cross-examine was directly at variance with the board\u2019s practice, as previously followed, of checking the membership alleged by an applicant union, with the lists of the employer as of the date of the application for certification and as of the date of the hearing, and that since counsel for the respondent was precluded by previous rulings of the board in similar proceedings from himself examining the membership cards or other evidence filed by the appellant, the right to cross-examine, as asked, was vital in order to bring out the relevant and material facts. Counsel for the appellant objected to any cross\u2011examination of the union officials and submitted that the matter of resignations was irrelevant and that the documents which had been filed did represent members in good standing according to \u201cthe constitution of the applicant union\u201d. He, however, refused to deny receipt of resignations from membership in the union of employees in the circulation department, nor did the secretary to the appellant, who had given evidence, do so. The chairman of the board ruled against any cross-examination of the witness by counsel for the respondent.\nCounsel for the respondent thereupon submitted that since the respondent was precluded by the board\u2019s own regulation from soliciting evidence from employees, if it wished to avoid being charged with interference with their rights under the regulations, and since the board had ruled against his right to cross-examine, a heavy onus lay upon the board to make a full and fair investigation in order to satisfy itself that a majority of the employees of the union were members in good standing of the appellant. Counsel submitted that the board itself should question the witness with respect to whose testimony cross-examination had been denied and should itself examine the documents filed. This was also objected to by counsel for the appellant and the board sustained the objection.\nCounsel for the respondent then submitted that the board ought to make a full and fair investigation, including the examination of some or all of the employees of the company in the department concerned so that it might be satisfied that a majority of the employees were members in good standing of the appellant. Counsel for the appellant objected to any such investigation on the ground of delay. Counsel for the respondent then submitted that the issue could be resolved by secret ballot, as had been requested by the respondent in its reply.\nAll these facts are proved by the affidavit of counsel for the respondent. They are not denied and there is no other evidence. Counsel for the appellant in this court submitted that the court should not draw any inferences but should confine its consideration to facts explicitly stated in the affidavit.\nThe board did not take any secret ballot, and, so far as is disclosed by the record, made no inquiry or investigation beyond what appears above.\nIt may be observed with respect to the subject-matter of the proposed cross-examination of the appellant\u2019s witness, that subsequent to the hearing and prior to the 8th of August, counsel for the respondent was voluntarily furnished by an employee in the department in question with nineteen certificates of post office registration which the employee instructed counsel were receipts for registered letters of resignation mailed to the secretary of the appellant between the 8th of June and the 10th of July, 1950. Counsel\u2019s instructions with respect to the existence of resignations upon which he had acted at the hearing in proposing to adduce evidence with respect to this matter, cannot, therefore, be considered as other than well\u2011founded.\nIt is plain from this recital of facts that there was no \u201chearing\u201d of the matter before the board for investigation within any reasonable interpretation of the word. There is nothing in either s\u2011s. (7) or (8) of s. 3 remotely to suggest that a witness giving evidence before the board at a hearing which may not proceed ex parte, may give evidence without being liable to be examined by a party adverse in interest. The statute, in my opinion, proceeds upon the view that the hearing is to be a real hearing, fairly conducted as between the opposing parties whatever may be the issue which the board may be called upon to determine in particular circumstances.\nIn the case at bar it was impossible for the board to determine whether any one of the persons alleged to be members of the appellant was in fact a member in good standing if the board refused to enter upon the question as to whether or not, assuming membership to have originally existed, it had continued. This was the very obligation placed upon the board by the statute. By refusing to enter upon it, the board in fact declined jurisdiction. It is well settled that any order pronounced by an inferior tribunal in such circumstances is subject to the supervising jurisdiction of the superior courts, exercisable by way of certiorari.\nThe appellant refers to s. 5 of the statute which reads as follows:\n5. Subject to such right of appeal as may be provided by the regulations, the orders, decisions and rulings of the Board shall be final and shall not be questioned or reviewed nor shall any proceeding before the Board be removed, nor shall the Board be restrained, by injunction, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, certiorari or otherwise by any court, but the Board may, if it considers it advisable to do so, reconsider any decision or order made by it and may vary or revoke any such decision or order. The appellant, however, admits that this section would not deprive a superior court of jurisdiction \u201cif there were a manifest defect of jurisdiction\u201d, but the appellant contends that a mere refusal to permit the cross-examination of a witness does not amount to a \u201cmanifest defect of jurisdiction\u201d. In support of this contention, reference was made to Rex v. Murphy,[11] where the refusal of a court-martial to permit cross-examination of two witnesses for the prosecution with respect to certain evidence given by them at a previous proceeding with relation to the accused, was held not enough to invoke the supervising jurisdiction of the court.\nThe principle laid down in the case just cited may for present purposes be taken as correct in circumstances such as were in question in that case, but the distinction between such a case and the case at bar is that the board here in question, having refused to permit the respondent to examine the documentary evidence filed by the appellant and having by its regulations and the interpretation which it had given them, prohibited the employer from himself inquiring among his employees with respect to union membership, effectively removed from the respondent by its ruling with respect to the proposed cross-examination its only remaining means of knowing what the case of the appellant was. Moreover, the board itself declined to enter into the inquiry which the statute laid upon it. Such arbitrary conduct is not within the principle of the case referred to but, in my view, makes applicable the principle of the decision in The Queen v. Marsham,[12].\nIn that case a district board of works had incurred expense under a statute in paving a street and sought to recover against an abutting owner his proportional share. The magistrate before whom the matter came refused to permit cross-examination of the clerk of the board as to whether the whole sum, the proportioned part of which was sought to be recovered from the defendant, included items other than purely paving expenses. It was held by the Court of Appeal that the act of the magistrate was not a mere rejection of evidence but amounted to a declining to enter upon an inquiry upon which he was bound to enter. What is said by Lord Esher, M.R., at page 378, is pertinent:\nNow, the form in which he is said to have declined jurisdiction is, that he refused to hear certain evidence which was tendered before him, and it is suggested on behalf of the board that such refusal, at the most, only amounted to a wrongful refusal to receive evidence, and not to a declining of jurisdiction. The distinction between the two is sometimes rather nice, but it is plain that a judge may wrongly refuse to hear evidence upon either of two grounds: one, that even if received the evidence would not prove the subject-matter which the judge was bound to inquire into; the other, that whether he evidence would prove the subject-matter or not, the subject-matter itself was one into which he had no jurisdiction to inquire. In the former case the judge would be wrongly refusing to receive evidence, but would not be refusing jurisdiction, as he would in the latter. Here the magistrate does not say that the evidence tendered would not prove the fact that the claim of the board included matters outside the statute; he has refused to hear the evidence, even though it would prove that fact; he has, therefore, declined jurisdiction.\nIn the course of the argument in this court the possibility was suggested from the bench that the ruling of the board, excluding the subject-matter of resignation from consideration, might have proceeded upon the footing that under the union constitution any withdrawal of membership was ineffective at the time of the hearing.\nNowhere in the proceedings, below was such a point taken on behalf of the appellant, nor is it taken in the factum of the appellant in this court. It is, moreover, to be noted that the board itself was a party to these proceedings in both of the courts below. Neither the board nor the appellant saw fit to file any material but was content to have the case disposed of on the affidavit of counsel for the respondent before the board, and the appellant\u2019s position in this court, as already mentioned, is that no inferences should be drawn beyond what is expressly stated in the affidavit.\nHad the union constitution contained any such clause, it is inconceivable that the matter would not have been referred to before the board itself or evidence with respect to the point been placed before the court in these proceedings. I do not think, therefore, that this court can be asked to assume anything in this respect. The evidence is that the board ruled that the subject-matter of resignation was quite irrelevant. A provision such as s. 5 of the statute prohibits the court from questioning any decision which has been come to within the structure of the statute itself, but the statute does not endow the board with power to make arbitrary decisions. The legislature must be taken to have been quite familiar with the principles applicable to decisions of inferior tribunals when questioned in the courts. It has not used apt language if it intended, as it cannot be presumed to have intended, to place either of the parties to such a proceeding as that here in question in a position permitting of no relief no matter how arbitrary any particular decision of its creature, the board, may be.\nIn The Queen v. Wood.[13] a case of a conviction under a statute which provided that no \u201cproceeding to be had touching the conviction of any offender against this Act,\u2026 shall be vacated, quashed, or set aside for want of form, or be removed or removable by certiorari or other writ or process whatsoever in any of the superior courts\u201d, Lord Campbell C.J., at page 59 said:\nAs to the clause taking away the certiorari, we came to the conclusion that the justice had declined jurisdiction and therefore had not properly exercised it.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nCARTWRIGHT J., (dissenting): The facts out of which this appeal arises and the relevant provisions of The Labour Relations Act, 1948, Ontario, c. 51 and of the regulations and rules made thereunder are set out in the reasons of other members of the Court.\nI understood counsel for the appellant to concede the power of the Supreme Court of Ontario in proceedings by way of certiorari to set aside the order of the Board if it appeared, (i) that it had failed to perform the duty, stated by Lord Loreburn L.C. in Board of Education v. Rice[14] to be, to \u201cact in good faith and fairly listen to both sides\u201d, or (ii) that it had exceeded its jurisdiction, or (iii) that it had declined jurisdiction.\nI am unable to say upon the record before us that the Board did any of these things. It is to be presumed until the contrary appears that the Board acted in good faith and in the case at bar bad faith is not suggested. What is complained of is that the Board refused to permit cross-examination or to receive or obtain for itself evidence all directed to establishing that between the date of the application for certification and the date of the hearing a number of employees of the respondent who had theretofore been members of the appellant had sent in their resignations and had consequently ceased to be \u201cmembers in good standing\u201d. It is clear that before finally ruling that the fact of such resignations having been sent in was irrelevant to the question whether the senders were members in good standing the Board heard full argument from counsel for both parties. The ruling indicates that the Board reached the conclusion that a member who sent in his resignation during the stated period nonetheless remained a member in good standing at the date of the hearing. If this conclusion was right then the evidence tendered was irrelevant. It may well be that the conclusion was wrong; but that would, or might, depend upon the provisions of the constitution of the appellant which may or may not have been before the Board or upon the contents of the written applications for membership which were before the Board. Assuming, without deciding, that the ruling was wrong it appears to me to have been at the most a wrongful refusal to receive evidence and not a declining of jurisdiction. I respectfully accept as a correct statement of the law the passage from the judgment of Lord Esher M.R. in The Queen v. Marsham[15] quoted in the reasons of my brother Kerwin and applying it to the facts of the case at bar I think that the ground on which the Board refused to hear the evidence of resignations was the first ground mentioned by Lord Esher, i.e., that even if received it would not prove the subject matter into which the Board was bound to inquire, that is whether those who sent in their resignations ceased to be members in good standing.\nI conclude, therefore, that no refusal to hear the parties, or excess of jurisdiction or declining of jurisdiction is made out and that effect must be given to the provisions of the Statute which render the decision of the Board final and forbid its review. While the above reasons appear to me to be sufficient to dispose of the appeal I wish to express my general agreement with the reasons of my brother Rand and I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by him.\nFAUTEUX J.: If the controlling power of superior courts over inferior tribunals or administrative bodies performing judicial functions is to be operative in the cases where, in principle, it is conceded to exist, the superior courts must somehow or other be enabled to see that jurisdiction has not been exceeded or has not been declined. In what way they shall so see is not material, provided they do so see. In Dempster v. Purnell,[16] Tindal, C.J., at page 39, said:\u2014\nI take the rule to be well established by the cases of Moravia v. Sloper, Willes, 30, and Titley v. Foxall, Willes, 688, that, where it appears upon the face of the proceedings that the inferior court has jurisdiction, it will be intended that the proceedings are regular; but that, unless it so appears, that is, if it appear affirmatively that the inferior court has no jurisdiction, or if it be left in doubt whether it has jurisdiction or not, no such intendment will be made.\nThere is no reason why the rule would not obtain in cases where the point as to jurisdiction is focussed to a declining of jurisdiction. In the present instance, it was mandatory for the Board, before concluding that the alleged members of the appellant trade union were in good standing in the union and ultimately that the union was entitled to be certified as bargaining agent of the unit concerned, to decide any question arising as to the particular matter. S. 4 of The Labour Relations Act, 1948 makes that duty clear. The right of the parties to submit to the Board any such questions is implied and the obligation for the Board to determine them and, consequently, to deal with them judicially before reaching its conclusion on the ultimate point to which they are related, is expressed. On a consideration of the material admittedly showing what took place before the Board, I cannot convince myself that the latter did not decline jurisdiction as a result of its rulings on the various requests made at hearing by the respondent, all of them being directed to the contestation of the right of the appellant trade union to be certified as bargaining agent. In the perspective of all that took place, the ruling as to the evidence is, I think, as much, if not more, consistent with a declining of jurisdiction than with a wrongful refusal to receive evidence. Bad faith of the Board has not been suggested and only a misinterpretation of the law as to what its duty was may explain this substantive failure to adequately exercise its jurisdiction. The authorities are clear that jurisdiction cannot be obtained nor can it be declined as a result of a misinterpretation of the law, and that in both cases the controlling power of superior courts obtains, notwithstanding the existence in the Act of a no certiorari clause.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Jolliffe, Lewis & Osler.\nSolicitors for the respondent: MacDonald & MacIntosh.\n[1] [1952] O.R. 345; 102 C.C.C. 318; [1952] 2 D.L.R. 302.\n[2] [1951] O.R. 435; 100 C.C.C. 301; [1951] 3 D.L.R. 162.\n[3] [1892] 1 Q.B. 371.\n[4] [1922] 2 A.C. 128.\n[5] [1951] 1 K.B. 711.\n[6] [1952] 1 K.B. 338.\n[7] [1921] 2 I.R. 190.\n[8] [1922] 1 A.C. 202.\n[9] [1911] A.C. 179.\n[10] [1915] A.C. 120.\n[11] [1921] 2 I.R. 190.\n[12] [1892] 1 Q.B. 371.\n[13] (1855) 5 E. & B. 49.\n[14] [1911] A.C. 179.\n[15] [1892] 1 Q.B. 371 at 378.\n[16] (1841) 4 Sc.

The application was supported by an affidavit stating that in the belief of the deponent the plaintiff (respondent) had a good cause of action. The application was allowed and the appellant then, by leave granted it under s. 82(1)(b) of the Exchequer Court Act R.S.C. 1927, c. 34, as amended by 1949, c. 5, s. 2, appealed on the grounds that the court below had erred in applying Falcon v.

F. Henderson for the appellant.\nH. E. Manning Q.C. for the respondent.\nKerwin J. (dissenting):\u2014By leave granted by Mr. Justice Estey under s-s. 1 of s. 82 of the Exchequer Court Act as enacted in 1949, Muzak Corporation appeals from an order of the President of the Exchequer Court granting Composers, Authors and Publishers Association, the plaintiff in an action in that Court, leave to issue a notice of the statement of claim for service out of the jurisdiction against the appellant. S-s. 1 of s. 82 reads as follows:\u2014\n82. (1) An appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada lies\n(a) from a final judgment or a judgment upon a demurrer or point of law raised by the pleadings, and\n(b) with leave of a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada, from an interlocutory judgment,\npronounced by the Exchequer Court in an action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding, in which the actual amount in controversy exceeds five hundred dollars.\nUnless \"interlocutory judgment\" in this subsection includes \"order\", there is nothing to which it applies, and the paragraph would be nugatory. Notwithstanding the use of the word \"judgment\" and \"order\" in other sections of the Act and in the Rules, I am not prepared to hold that Parliament in enacting a provision, which so far as (b) is concerned was new, meant and accomplished nothing thereby. There being jurisdiction to grant leave, should the President's order be set aside? The action was commenced by a statement of claim filed April 16, 1952, the plaintiff being the present respondent and the defendants Associated Broadcasting Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as Associated), Martin Maxwell, and Muzak Corp. Presumably after the statement of claim had been served in Canada upon the first two defendants, an affidavit was made by Harry Houghton, described as President of Muzak Corporation, a company incorporated and organized under the laws of the State of New York, and also as President of Muzak Corporation, a company incorporated and organized under the laws of Delaware, and stating that the New York company succeeded to the business carried on by the Delaware company. This affidavit, to which further reference will be made, was sworn to on June 16, 1952. As a result, the statement of claim was amended by striking out Muzak Corp. as a party defendant and any reference to it and by making Muzak Corporation, the present appellant, the third defendant. Notice of the motion for leave to issue notice of the statement of claim for service out of the jurisdiction was served upon the appellant and the other defendants. The order in appeal was made after considering the statement of claim, two affidavits upon which the motion was based, and the affidavit of Harry Houghton.\nThe statement of claim is to the following effect. The plaintiff was the owner of the sole right to perform in public throughout Canada numerous musical works and at all relevant times it was entitled to require the defendants, and each of them, to take out a licence to perform such works in Canada and to pay the fees prescribed, and none of the defendants obtained such a licence. The appellant caused recordings known as electrical transcriptions to be made of musical works specially arranged for the purpose of enabling such transcriptions to be performed by means of transcription turntables. Transcriptions were furnished by the appellant to Associated of several musical works, the sole right to perform which in public throughout Canada was owned by the plaintiff. Associated performed (and the defendant Maxwell as principal shareholder, director and executive officer, counselled, authorized and procured it so to do) a number of musical works in which the respondent had the appropriate copyright. The appellant furnished the transcriptions only to those entering into contracts with it. By paragraph 8 it was alleged that such a contract was entered into between the appellant and Associated whereby the latter became a franchise holder on terms that it should receive from the appellant programs suitable for performance and reproduction and pay the appellant a percentage of ten percentum of the gross receipts from all contracts made by Associated with its subscribers for the musical programs. Paragraph 13 reads:\u2014\n13. The Defendant Muzak, by virtue of the agreement set forth in paragraph 8 hereof and the acts performed by it thereunder, and the Defendant Maxwell, by virtue of the acts hereinbefore set forth, have infringed the Plaintiff's copyright in the said musical works by authorizing the performances of the said musical works, the sole right to perform which in public in Canada is the property of the Plaintiff.\nOne affidavit filed on behalf of the plaintiff was made by its counsel, who stated that he had advised the plaintiff that in his opinion he believed that the plaintiff had a good cause of action against the appellant in respect of the matters disclosed in the statement of claim. The second affidavit filed on behalf of the plaintiff was made by C R. Matheson, paragraphs 4 and 5 whereof state:\u2014\n4. The statement of claim should be served upon the Defendant Muzak Corporation because it authorizes and did authorize all the performances in question in this action and it is a necessary and proper person to be joined in the present action.\n5. The Defendant Muzak Corporation is engaged in the business of providing electrical transcriptions and programme schedules to enable musical works to be performed in the manner in which they are alleged to be performed in the statement of claim in this action and collects very substantial fees from the so-called franchise holders to whom pursuant to contracts entered into by Muzak Corporation the electrical transcriptions and programme schedules for performance are made available to franchise holders including the Defendant Association Broadcasting Corporation Limited.\nParagraphs 6 to 11 of the affidavit of Harry Houghton, referred to earlier, are as follows:\u2014\n6. The New York Company lets and supplies to the Defendant, Associated Broadcasting Company Limited, (hereinafter called Associated) in the United States of America under contract a library of electrical transcriptions containing musical selections.\n7. The New York Company delivers to Associated the library in the United States of America, Associated being responsible for all customs duties and other taxes that may be levied in respect of the importation of the said library into Canada.\n8. By contract with the New York Company Associated is granted a territorial franchise in respect of the use of the said library of transcriptions. 9. The contracts between the New York Company and Associated were entered into in the State of New York and are governed in their interpretation and construction by the laws of the State of New York and all payments are made in the said State of New York.\n10. The New York Company does not do any act in Canada.\n11. The New York Company denies that it has authorized Associated to use any musical selection in infringement of the rights of any person.\nI take it that \"lets\" signifies that the appellant leased the electrical transcriptions to Associated and did not sell them.\nRules 76 and 42 of the Exchequer Court Act read:\u2014\nRule 76. When a defendant is out of the jurisdiction of the Court, then upon application, supported by affidavit or other evidence stating that in the belief of the deponent the plaintiff has a good cause of action, and showing in what place or country such defendant is or probably may be found, the Court or a Judge may order that a notice of the information, petition of right, statement of claim or other judicial proceeding be served on the defendant in such place or country or within such limits as the Court or a Judge thinks fit to direct, and the order is, in such case, to limit a time (depending on the place of service) within which the defendant is to file his statement in defence, plea, answer or exception, or otherwise make his defence according to the practice applicable to the particular case, or obtain from the Court or a Judge further time to do so.\nRule 42. In any proceeding in the Exchequer Court respecting any patent of invention, copyright, trade mark or industrial design, the practice and procedure shall, in any matter not provided for by any Act of the Parliament of Canada or by the Rules of this Court (but subject always thereto) conform to, and be regulated by, as near as may be, the practice and procedure for the time being in force in similar proceedings in His Majesty's Supreme Court of Judicature in England.\nIn my opinion this has the effect of making applicable Order XI, Rules 1 and 4 of the English Rules :\u2014\nRule 1. Service out of the jurisdiction of a writ of summons or notice of a writ of summons may be allowed by the Court or a Judge whenever \u2026\n(ee) The action is founded on a tort committed within the jurisdiction.\n(f) Any injunction is sought as to anything to be done within the jurisdiction, or any nuisance within the jurisdiction is sought to be prevented or removed, whether damages are or are not also sought in respect thereof; or\n(g) Any person out of the jurisdiction is a necessary or proper party to an action properly brought against some other person duly served within the jurisdiction.\nRule 4. Every application for leave to serve such writ or notice on a defendant out of the jurisdiction shall be supported by affidavit or other evidence, stating that in the belief of the deponent the plaintiff has a good cause of action, and showing in what place or country such defendant is or probably may be found, and whether such defendant is a British subject or not, and the grounds upon which the application is made; and no such leave shall be granted unless it shall be made sufficiently to appear to the Court or Judge that the case is a proper one for service out of the jurisdiction under this Order. A reference to the following authorities is sufficient to indicate the tests that have been laid down in applying these rules. In Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik v. Chemische Fabrik vormals Sandoz 1, Joyce J. said at page 491:\u2014\nI am invited on this application to try the question whether there has been infringement or not. I am not going to do anything of the kind; but it is perfectly clear that questions of fact are raised and also a very serious question of law.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Collins M.R. said at page 494:\u2014\nNow, it does not appear to me that in conferring this jurisdiction\u2014 which I agree is an important one and one to be carefully exercised\u2014the Legislature has imposed on the courts the duty of trying the case before they allow the plaintiff to put it in suit. That would be going much too far in favour of persons outside the jurisdiction.\n* * *\nIf the court has got before it a prima facie case which is not completely displaced by the evidence on the other side, then it seems to me that the plaintiff has not lost his right to have that case tried.\nOn appeal to the House of Lords 2 the order was again affirmed. Lord Davey said at page 735:\u2014\nThis does not, of course, mean that a mere statement by any deponent who is put forward to make the affidavit that be believes that there is a good cause of action is sufficient. On the other hand, the court is not, on an application for leave to serve out of the jurisdiction, or on a motion made to discharge an order for such service, called upon to try the action or express a premature opinion on its merits,\n* * *\nIf the Court is judicially satisfied that the alleged facts, if proved, will not support the action, I think the court ought to say so, and dismiss the application, or discharge the order. But where there is a substantial legal question arising on the facts disclosed by the affidavits which the plaintiff bon\u00e2 fide desires to try, I think that the court should, as a rule, allow the service of the writ.\nIn Vitkovice Horni A Hutni Tezirstvo v. Korner 3, Lord Simonds stated at page 878:\u2014\n\u2026 the obligation of the plaintiff is, not to \"satisfy\" the court that he is right, but to make it sufficiently appear \u2026 that the case is a \"proper one for service out of the jurisdiction under this order.\"\nreferring to the remarks of Lord Davey in 90 L.T.R., p. 735, (supra) Lord Simonds, at page 879, stated:\u2014\nIt is, no doubt, difficult to say precisely what test must be passed for an applicant to make it sufficiently appear that the case is a proper one.\nand at page 880:\u2014\nThe description \"a good arguable case\" has been suggested and I do not quarrel with it. In my opinion a good arguable case has been suggested by the combined effect of the statement of claim and the three affidavits. Upon the trial of the action, difficult questions of law will no doubt emerge but as to these I express no opinion. The reasons of the President in granting the motion are short:\u2014\nI grant the motion based upon Falcon v. Famous Players Film Co. 4, and on appeal 5.\nI agree that the case cited is distinguishable from the present but that fact does not, in my opinion, indicate that the President proceeded upon a wrong principle. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nTaschereau, J. (dissenting) :\u2014I have reached the conclusion that the \"order\" given by the learned President of the Exchequer Court, authorizing the respondent to issue a notice of the statement of claim for service out of the jurisdiction against the appellant, is an \"interlocutory judgment\", within the meaning of s. 82(1)(b) of the Exchequer Court Act, and that therefore this Court has jurisdiction to hear the present appeal, leave having been granted.\nAs to the second point, I do not think that this Court should interfere with the conclusion of the trial judge. When by affidavit or otherwise, it is shown, that the plaintiff has a \"good arguable case\" against the party intended to be served, the court or the judge may properly issue the order. It is not the function of a court or a judge who considers an application, as the one made in the present case, to go into all the merits of the litigation, and to dispose of the ultimate rights of the parties.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nRand J.:\u2014On the argument, Mr. Manning gave us a very full statement of the scope of copyright in musical composition. It is distributed into a number of interests both \"vertical\" and \"horizontal\". By s. 3 of the statute the copyright holder has the sole right \"to produce, reproduce\", say, a song in sheet form for ordinary sale; to perform it in public; to make a record of it by means enabling it to be performed mechanically; to adapt and present it publicly by cinematograph or radio communication. These rights, again, may be limited to sale or production or performance in specified areas of specified countries and they may be exclusive to one person or open to the market.\nThe material on which the order for service out of the jurisdiction was made shows that Muzak Corporation carries on in New York the business of furnishing electric transcriptions and programme schedules by way of hire as the means by which Associated Broadcasting Company can perform the compositions in Ontario. The units are shipped from New York at the entire cost of Associated, including customs duties and other taxes and fees payable in this country. Furnishing the transcript in New York violates no law or copyright there and it is done in the ordinary course of business. All payments to Muzak by Associated are made there. The privilege enjoyed by Associated within Ontario is exclusive and is of the same nature as another \"franchise\" granted to a different company for Quebec.\nIt is, then, the simple situation of a hiring in New York by a Canadian company of a means or instrument for performing a copyright musical composition in Canada. Muzak is in no other sense related to the business in Canada of Associated; and there is no more connection between that company and the payment of performance fees than the payment of customs duties at the border.\nBut it is said that the sole rights enjoyed under s. 3 include that \"to authorize any such acts as aforesaid\", which Muzak has violated. Obviously, in one sense, Muzak authorizes Associated to make use of instruments which it owns but that use is to be in accordance with regulations dealing with it. There is not a syllable in the material to suggest that Muzak has made itself a party in interest to the performance either by warranting the right to perform without fee or by anything in the nature of a partnership or similar business relation. If by letting a device the owner is to be taken as engaging himself to its use in defiance of regulations, the very distinction between the right to make a record and the right to give a public performance by means of it which Mr. Manning made and the Act provides for, is wiped out. It would be as if a person who lets a gun to another is to be charged with \"authorizing\" hunting without a game license. It is urged that in some manner or other the exclusive \"franchise\", as it is called, to make use of the transcription in Ontario supports the contention that Muzak has \"authorized its use\" within the meaning of s. 3, but how that has anything to do with the conditions under law which relate to public performances I am at a loss to see. The word \"franchise\" is here simply a commercial use of the term meaning an exclusive right within a given territory; it has nothing whatever to do with the conditions in law under which that right is to be exercised.\nThe rules of the Exchequer Court dealing with service of this nature are of a most skeletal form. By r. No. 2 the practice and procedure not otherwise provided shall conform to and be regulated as near as may be by that at the time in force in the Supreme Court of Judicature in England; but it is not necessary, for the purposes of this appeal, to treat the rules of Order No. 11 as being applicable by reason of that provision. An order for such service is the exercise of an unusual power by the domestic forum, and it has at all times been limited to such situations as are consistent with a proper appreciation of the limitations to be placed on exercising jurisdiction beyond a country's territorial boundaries. If the person beyond those limits has been a party to an act within them, that is a basic fact to which the power may be related; but in all cases the minimal requirement is that a prima facie case be shown. This attempt to attach Muzak to the activities of Associated would be futile were it not for the retained ownership of the instruments which it hires to Associated; and it is by the coercion made available by that fact that the effectiveness of a service out of the jurisdiction could be realized. On the facts laid before the Court as I find them, there is not the slightest warrant for exercising this power.\nAgreeing as I do that for the reasons given by my brother Cartwright, a right to bring the case here lies, I would allow the appeal and set aside the order below with costs both here and in the Exchequer Court.\nKellock J.:\u2014In Vigneux v. Canadian Performing Right Society Ltd. 6, Lord Russell of Killowen, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, said, at p. 123, with reference to the owners of the mechanical device and suppliers of the records there in question:\n\u2026 their Lordships think, they neither gave the public performance \u2026 nor did they authorize it. They had no control over the use of the machine; they had no voice as to whether at any particular time it was to be available to the restaurant customers or not. The only part which they played in the matter was, in the ordinary course of their business, to hire out to Raes one of their machines and supply it with records, at a weekly rental of ten dollars.\nIn the case at bar the respondent claims to be the owner of the sole right to perform the works here in question in Canada, and alleges infringement on the part of the appellant because, as it is said, the appellant has \"authorized\" the performance of the said musical works under its contract with the defendant broadcasting company. The business of the appellant is to supply in the State of New York, in consideration of fees payable in New York, electrical recordings of musical works adapted for performance on certain mechanical contrivances, to persons entering into contracts with the appellant in New York, under which a territorial \"franchise\" is granted with respect to the use of such recordings. It is by reason of the entry by the appellant into such a contract with the defendant broadcasting company with respect to some part of Canada that the respondent rests its claim.\nFor any performance on its own part of any musical work which is the subject of copyright, the evidence is that the appellant obtains a licence from the copyright owner and also, with respect to franchise holders from the appellant in the United States, the former obtain their own licences, as is also the case with respect to the only other franchise holder in Canada.\nThe learned President who made the order permitting service upon the appellant outside the jurisdiction did so \"upon Falcon v. Famous Players Film Co. 7, and on appeal 8.\" In my opinion, with respect, when this decision is examined, it has no application in the circumstances here present. It is not in fact a decision upon any question as to the propriety of permitting service outside the jurisdiction. It is a decision upon the merits in an action. In that case a United States company had made a film of a literary work, the copyright in which was the property of the plaintiff. It then sent the negative and two positives to an English company, who made further copies and handed them to a second English company which let out a copy to the proprietor of a picture theatre for exhibition. All three companies participated in the moneys paid by the theatre proprietor and it was conceded by their counsel that no distinction was to be drawn between any of them but that they were all to be treated as on the same footing. The contract with the actual exhibitor contained the following clause: \"the company shall grant to the hirer the right to exhibit the film\" for the sum of \u00a320, \"which sum the hirer agrees to pay on the first day of exhibition of the said film, and in any event not later than the final day of such exhibition.\"\nOn the terms of that contract Scrutton L.J., considered that the defendants had imposed an obligation upon the exhibitor to exhibit the film in order that they should receive the moneys provided for by the contract, and that in so doing the defendants were themselves involved in performance.\nIn the view of Atkin L.J., as he then was, the hiring out of the film\non the terms of the contract of hiring, which is before us\namounted to an \"authorization\" to the exhibitor to perform the play. He said at p. 499:\nFor the purposes of this case it appears to me that to \"authorize\" means to grant or to purport to grant to a third person the right to do the act complained of, whether the intention is that the grantee shall do the act on his own account or only on account of the grantor;\nIt is plain, therefore, that in Falcon's case the defendants did not merely supply the film but purported to confer upon the exhibitor the right to perform in opposition to the right of the true owner.\nThe theory of the respondent in the case at bar assumes that the grant of a \"franchise\" extending to this country necessarily involves the grant of the \"right\" to perform in this country. Evidence of any such element in the contract in question in the case at bar is entirely lacking. The word \"franchise\" connotes nothing more than \"privilege\" and nothing more on the evidence as to the contents of the contract can reasonably be inferred than that it confers the privilege of using the recordings. It is not, therefore, to be assumed that the appellant purported to grant to the defendants any right to perform in Canada and certainly not the right to perform in opposition to the title of the true owner of that right.\nIn Falcon's case, Bankes, L.J., with whom Atkin L.J., agreed, approved of earlier expressions of opinion as to the meaning of \"authorize\", namely, that it is to be understood in its ordinary dictionary sense of \"sanction, approve, and countenance\". Unless what is done by a defendant is to sanction, approve or countenance actual performance, it cannot be said, in my opinion, that it has \"authorized\" performance. While it is true that to perform by means of such a mechanical contrivance as is here in question involves the use of recordings, and while the appellant, on the evidence, has authorized the use of the recordings in performing, it has not authorized the performance itself and has, therefore, not invaded any right of the respondent. Performance was clearly contemplated and authorized in Falcon's case, while in the case at bar the appellant is in the position of the appellant in Vigneux's case, as described by Lord Russell in the passage from the judgment above cited.\nMr. Manning contends that the language of Lord Russell is quite inconsistent with the decision of the Judicial Committee in the earlier case of Mellor v. Australian Broadcasting Commission 9, but I find no such inconsistency. It would have been strange had it been otherwise in view of the fact that both Viscount Maugham and Lord Porter were members of the Board in each instance. In Mellor's case, the appellants, who carried on business as publishers of music and were the owners of the performing right in Australia in certain musical works which they had supplied to a band with a licence to perform the same, alleged infringement against the defendant broadcasting commission in respect of its broadcasting of the performance by a band of these musical works. In that case, however, it was shown, and indeed admitted, that the actual performance was one for which the defendant Commission was itself responsible. With respect to Mr. Manning's contention as to the construction of r. 76 of the Exchequer Court Rules and s. 75 of the Statute itself that these provisions constitute a complete code of procedure and that r. 42 does not apply so as to invoke the practice in the Supreme Court of Judicature in England, I cannot agree. Such a contention is, moreover, opposed to the long-standing view implicit in the reference of the second edition of Audette, at page 436, to the seventh edition of Wilson's Judicature Act, page 151, which deals with O. XI of the rules relating to the Supreme Court of Judicature. In my opinion, this Order is invoked by r. 42 of the Exchequer Court Rules and it is not sufficient for the applicant for an order for leave to serve outside the jurisdiction, simply to file an affidavit or other evidence stating his belief that the plaintiff has a good cause of action.\nThe cause of action here alleged by the respondent is a tort committed within Canada. In such a case the question for the appellate court is, in the words of Lord Simonds in Vitkovice Horni A Hutni Tezirstvo v. Korner 10:\n\u2026 whether the learned judge did exercise his discretion, and did so on the right principles.\nIn Chemische Fabrik vormals Sandoz v. Badische Anilin und Soda Fabriks 11, Lord James at 735 said:\n\u2026 the court ought, I think, to be convinced by the proof brought before it that the applicant is in a position to present to the tribunals of the country a substantial case for their determination.\nLord Davey uses much the same language at 735:\nBut where there is a substantial legal question arising on the facts disclosed by the affidavits which the plaintiff bona fide desires to try, I think that the court should, as a rule, allow the service of the writ.\nIn Vitkovice's case Lord Simonds uses the words \"a good arguable case.\"\nIn my view the respondent has failed to show, on the evidence presented, the existence of any such case.\nAs I agree that notwithstanding the employment of the words \"judgment\" and \"order\" throughout the Exchequer Court Act and Rules, it is difficult to give any meaning to the word \"interlocutory judgment\" without applying it to \"order\", the appeal should be allowed and the order below set aside with costs throughout. Cartwright J. :\u2014This is an appeal, brought pursuant to leave granted by Estey J., from a decision of the learned President giving the respondent leave to issue a notice of the statement of claim for service out of the jurisdiction upon the appellant, a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of New York and having its principal place of business in that State.\nThe respondent questions our jurisdiction to entertain the appeal on the ground that the decision from which it is taken is an interlocutory order and that the Exchequer Court Act does not authorize an appeal from an order but only from a judgment. The relevant section is 82, s-s. (1) and (4) of which read as follows:\u2014\n82. (1) An appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada lies\n(a) from a final judgment or a judgment upon a demurrer or point of law raised by the pleading, and\n(b) with leave of a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada, from an interlocutory judgment, pronounced by the Exchequer Court in an action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding, in which the actual amount in controversy exceeds five hundred dollars.\n(4) A judgment shall be considered final for the purpose of this section if it determines the rights of the parties, except as to the amount of the damages or the amount of liability.\nThe order appealed from is in the form of a judgment, that is to say, the operative part thereof commences with the words:\u2014 \"This Court doth order and adjudge that the Plaintiff be at liberty to issue a notice \u2026\". Counsel for the appellant, however, concedes that the form in which the decision of the learned President was entered is not decisive, and in my opinion, it is more properly described as an \"order\" than as a \"judgment\" if those terms are used in contradistinction from each other. S. 75 of the Exchequer Court Act confers the power to permit service of notice of proceedings on defendants out of the jurisdiction of the Court. The words used are, in s-s. (1), \"\u2026 a judge \u2026 may order \u2026 that notice \u2026 be served\", and in s-s (2), \"The order shall in such case \u2026\". The question is whether such an order falls within the words \"an interlocutory judgment\" in s. 82(1)(b) quoted above. In common parlance the word \"judgment\" is, I think, often used as a generic term including all judicial decisions. In the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Vol. 1, page 1071, one of the meanings given to it is:\u2014 \"a judicial decision or order in court\". Blackstone appears to have used the word \"judgments\" to include decisions which would now more usually be referred to as \"orders\"\u2014see Blackstone's Commentaries, (1768), Vol. 3, page 396:\u2014\nAll these species of judgments are either interlocutory or final. Interlocutory judgments are such as are given in the middle of a cause, upon some plea, proceeding, or default, which is only intermediate, and does not finally determine or complete the suit. Of this nature are all judgments for the plaintiff upon pleas in abatement of the suit or action: in which it is considered by the court, that the defendant do answer over, respondeat ouster; that is, put in a more substantial plea. It is easy to observe, that the judgment here given is not final, but merely interlocutory; for there are afterwards farther proceedings to be had, when the defendant hath put in a better answer.\nIn Ex Parte Chinery 12, Cotton L.J. said:\u2014\n\u2026 Now, in legal language, and in Acts of Parliament, as well as with regard to the rights of the parties, there is a well-known distinction between a \"judgment\" and an \"order\". No doubt the orders under the Judicature Act provide that every order may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment; but still judgments and orders are kept entirely distinct. It is not said that the word \"judgment\" shall in other Acts of Parliament include an \"order\". I think we ought to give to the words \"final judgment\" in this subsection their strict and proper meaning, i.e., a judgment obtained in an action by which a previous existing liability of the defendant to the plaintiff is ascertained or established\u2014unless there is something to shew an intention to use the words in a more extended sense.\nThis language was adopted by Lord Esher, M.R. in Onslow v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue 13, but in both of these cases the order held not to be a judgment had been obtained in a proceeding other than an action and in the last mentioned case Lord Esther said at page 466:\u2014\nA \"judgment\", therefore, is a decision obtained in an action, and every other decision is an order.\nIt will be observed that the judgments in both of the last mentioned cases envisage the possibility of there being something in the statutory provisions under consideration to show an intention on the part of Parliament to use the word \"judgment\" in a more extended sense. In the case at bar I think such an intention is shown by the circumstance, pointed out by my brother Kerwin, that if s. 82 is construed as dealing only with judgments falling strictly within the definition given by Cotton L.J. there would be nothing upon which clause (b) of subsection (1) of s. 82 could operate. A construction which would leave the clause without any effect must be avoided if possible, and, in this case, it can be avoided by giving to the word \"judgment\", a sense in which it is often used and interpreting it as including orders. While, in view of the decision of this Court in British American Brewing Co. Ltd. v. The King 14, I do not suggest that the interpretation section of the Supreme Court Act applies to s. 82 of the Exchequer Court Act, the words of clause (d) of s. 2 of the first mentioned Act furnish an example of the wide sense in which the word \"judgment\" is frequently employed. It reads as follows:\u2014\n2. (d) \"judgment\", when used with reference to the court appealed from, includes any judgment, rule, order, decision, decree, decretal order ( or sentence thereof; and when used with reference to the Supreme Court, includes any judgment or order of that Court;\nI conclude that we have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal and it becomes necessary to consider its merits.\nIn my opinion, the combined effect of s. 75 of the Exchequer Court Act and of rr. 76 and 42 of that Court is to make applicable to motions for leave to serve out of the jurisdiction the provisions of Order XI of the Supreme Court of Judicature in England. The principles by which the Court should be governed in dealing with applications under that order have been recently re-stated by the House of Lords in Vitkovice Horni a Hutni Tezirstvo v. Korner 15.\nThe learned President was of the view that the motion before him was governed by the decision in Falcon v. Famous Players Film Co. 16, 17. For the reasons given by my brother Kellock I am of opinion that the material before us does not indicate facts sufficient to bring the case at bar within that decision. After a perusal of all the material I am of opinion that it was not sufficient to justify the making of an order for service out under any of clauses (ee), (f) or (g) of rule 1 of 0. XI.\nI would allow the appeal and set aside the order below with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed and order of the Exchequer Court set aside. Appellant allowed costs of its motion before the Exchequer Court and of this appeal.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborn & Henderson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Manning, Mortimer & Kennedy.\n1 (1903) 88 L.T.R. 490.\n2 (1904) 90 L.T.R. 733.\n3 [1951] A.C. 869; 2 All E.R. 334.\n4 [1926] 1 K.B. 393.\n5 [1926] 2 K.B. 474.\n6 [1945] A.C. 108.\n7 [1926] 1 K.B. 393.\n8 [1926] 2 K.B. 474.\n9 [1940] 2 All E.R. 20.\n10 [1951] 2 All E.R. 334 at 336.\n11 90 L.T. 733.\n12 (1884) 12 Q.B.D. 342.\n13 (1890) 25 Q.B.D. 465.\n14 1935] S.C.R. 568.\n15 [1951] A.C. 869.\n16 [1926] 1 K.B. 393;\n17 [1926] 2 K.B. 474.\n"}

Co. shares from a German broker in Germany. By an action brought in the Exchequer Court of Canada he sought a declaration that he was their owner and for their delivery by the respondent to him or payment in lieu thereof. The latter contended that if the claimant had purchased the shares as alleged, he had done so illegally, contrary to the above-cited Orders and, that the shares had become the respondent's property pursuant to a general vesting order made by Duclos J. on April 23, 1919 under the provisions of the said Orders, confirmed by the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order 1920 and amendments. The claimant admitted that under the decision in Braun v. The Custodian [1944] S.C.R. 339, para. 6(1) applied to purchases from an enemy outside of Canada of shares in a Canadian company made subsequent to the publication of P.C. 1023 but argued that para. 6(1) did not apply here because (a) It did not prohibit dealings between two parties both of whom were German nationals and, (b) By the Treaty of Versailles the claimant had acquired French nationality as from Nov. 11, 1918.\nHeld: 1.\u2014That the nationality of the transferee was immaterial; Spitz v. Secretary of State for Canada [1939] Ex. C.R. 162; Braun v. The Custodian, supra, applied. The onus was on the appellant to show that the shares purchased by him in 1918 were not owned by the enemy but, even if that were not so, there was evidence in the record that they were.\n2.\u2014That so far as s. 34(1) of the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order 1920 was concerned, the appellant purchased the shares when he was a German national. Furthermore, he did not acquire any title in good faith and for value in accordance with Canadian law. Judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Thorson P., dismissing the action (not reported), affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Thorson P., dated June 15, 1950, dismissing the claimant's action with costs.\nRedmond Quain, Q.C., Henri St. Jacques, Q.C. and Auguste Lemieux, Q.C. for the appellant.\nG. F. Maclaren, Q.C. and L. A. Sherwood for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nKerwin J.:\u2014The appellant claimed a declaration that he had a good title to certain shares of stock and that the respondent, the Secretary of State for Canada as Custodian of Alien Enemy Property, had no interest in, or right or title to them. He also asked for delivery over of the certificates representing the shares, or payment in lieu thereof. The Exchequer Court declared \"that the shares never belonged to the claimant but belong to Canada and are vested in the respondent\" and dismissed the action.\nThe appellant was born in 1885 in Alsace-Lorraine and was a German national. In May and October, 1918, he was on leave from military service in the German army and in those months purchased 100 shares and 90 shares respectively of the capital stock of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. The certificates for these shares were in the names of Nationalbank fur Deutschland or G. Schlessinger-Trier & Co., both German banking houses with headquarters in Berlin, Germany. On the recommendation of a German, he purchased both lots in Strasburg from another German, Albert Bintz, acting as a broker. The certificates had been endorsed in blank by the registered owners and were treated as bearer certificates in the European Exchange.\nThe position of the Custodian has been explained in Spitz v. Secretary of State of Canada 1 and Braun v. The Custodian 2. By paragraph 1 of Order 6 of Canadian Order in Council P.C. 1023, of May 2, 1916:\u2014\n6. (1) No transfer made after the publication of these orders and regulations in the Canada Gazette, (unless upon licence duly granted exempting the particular transaction from the provisions of this subsection) by or on behalf of an enemy of any securities shall confer on the transferred any rights or remedies in respect thereof and no company or municipal authority or other body by whom the securities were issued or are managed shall, except as hereinafter appears, take any cognizance of or otherwise act upon any notice of such a transfer.\nThe appellant admits that under the decision in the Braun case this paragraph applies to purchases from an enemy outside Canada of shares in a Canadian company made subsequent to May 6, 1916, the date of publication of P.C. 1023 in the Canada Gazette. However, it was argued that the paragraph did not apply to the purchases here in question (1) because it did not prohibit dealings between two parties, both of whom were at the time German nationals and (2) because of the appellant's nationality. As to the first, while the appellant points out that P.C. 1023 is intituled \"Consolidated Orders respecting Trading with the Enemy\", paragraph 6(1) is clear and unambiguous, and the argument fails.\nThe Treaty of Versailles signed June 28, 1919, became effective at midnight on January 10, 1920. Under Section V thereof the appellant as an Alsace-Lorrainer acquired French nationality as from November 11, 1918, but this circumstance does not assist him. In the Spitz case the claimant was born in Slovakia, Hungary. While a subject of Czechoslovakia, which was recognized by the Allied Powers as an independent republic in October, 1918, he bought shares of stock from an enemy but he was held not entitled to succeed against the Custodian. That decision was approved in the Braun case where the claimant was a United States citizen who, under a general licence granted to citizens of that country, had purchased shares in Germany from an enemy. Braun also failed in his action against the Custodian. In both cases the nationality of the transferee was immaterial. The vesting order of Mr. Justice Duclos of April 23, 1919, referred to in the cases cited and made under paragraph 1 of Order 28 of P.C. 1023 also vested the shares here in question in the Custodian. If, because of Order 6(1) the appellant acquired no title to the shares, the fact that the order of Mr. Justice Duclos was made after the purchase by the appellant is of no significance. None of the provisions of the Treaty of Peace referred to on behalf of the appellant affects the matter. By c. 30 of 10 Geo. V., Parliament enacted \"An Act for carrying into effect the Treaties of Peace between His Majesty and certain other Powers\",\u2014including Germany. By subsection 1 of section 1:\u2014\n1. (1) The Governor in Council may make such appointments, establish such offices, make such Orders in Council, and do such things as appear to Him to be necessary for carrying out the said Treaties, and for giving effect to any of the provisions of the said Treaties.\nIn pursuance of this enactment, \"The Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920\" was passed by the Governor General in Council (P.C. 755). In Part II thereof, \"Property, Rights and Interests\", paragraph 32 provides that a German national who had acquired ipso facto in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty the nationality of a Power allied or associated during the war with His Majesty shall not be considered as a German national within the meaning of Part V. However, by paragraph 33 it was provided:\u2014\n33. All property, rights and interests in Canada belonging on the tenth day of January, 1920, to enemies, or theretofore belonging to enemies and in the possession or control of the Custodian at the date of this Order shall belong to Canada and are hereby vested in the Custodian.\n(2) Notwithstanding anything in any order heretofore made vesting in the Custodian any property, right or interest formerly belonging to an enemy, such property, right or interest shall belong to Canada and the Custodian shall hold the same on the same terms and with the same powers and duties in respect thereof as the property, rights and interests vested in him by this Order.\nIn 1924, upon a recital that the Secretary of State had reported that P.C. 755 contained certain clauses which were ambiguous and that others were found to require modification, the Governor General in Council, by P.C. 267, repealed paragraph 33 and substituted the following therefor:\u2014\n33. All property, rights and interests in Canada belonging on the 10th day of January, 1920, to enemies, or heretofore belonging to enemies, and in the possession or control of the Custodian at the date of this Order are hereby vested in and subject to the control of the Custodian.\n(2) Notwithstanding anything in any order heretofore made vesting in the Custodian any property, right or interest formerly belonging to an enemy, such property, right or interest shall be vested in and subject to the control of the Custodian, who shall hold the same on the same terms and with the same powers and duties in respect thereof as the property, rights and interest vested in him by this Order. The words \"theretofore\" in P.C. 755 and \"heretofore\" in P.C. 267 have the same effect. If the shares in question in this action belonged to an enemy on January 10, 1920, (the date of coming into force of the Treaty of Versailles) or theretofore and were in the possession or control of the Custodian, they thereby became vested in and subject to his control. Not only was there the earlier prohibition in Order 6(1) of P.C. 1023 of 1916 but there was the later vesting order of Mr. Justice Duclos of April 23, 1919.\nThis action was brought by the consent of the Custodian granted under paragraph 41 of The Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order 1920 as amended, permitting the appellant to proceed in the Exchequer Court for a declaration as to the ownership of the shares. The onus is on the appellant to show that the shares purchased by him in 1918 were not owned by an enemy but, even if that were not so, there is evidence in the record that the shares were owned by an enemy. In such a case not only must paragraph 1 of Order 6 of P.C. 1023 of May 2, 1916, and the vesting order of Mr. Justice Duclos be kept in mind but also sections 34 and 39 of The Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920. These are as follows:\u2014\n34. All vesting orders and all orders for the winding up of businesses or companies, and all other orders, directions, decisions and instructions of any Court in Canada or any Department of the Government of Canada made or given or purporting to be made or given in pursuance of the Consolidated Orders respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1916, or in pursuance of any other Canadian war legislation with regard to the property, rights and interests of enemies, and all actions taken with regard to any property, business or company, whether as regards its investigation, sequestration, compulsory administration, use, requisition, supervision or winding up, the sale or management of property, rights or interests, the collection or discharge of debts, the payment of costs, charges or expenses, or any other matter whatsoever in pursuance of any such order, direction, decision or instruction, and in general all exceptional war measures or measures of transfer or acts done or to be done in the execution of any such measures are hereby validated and confirmed and shall be considered as final and binding upon all persons, subject to the provisions of sections 33 and 41.\n(2) The interests of all persons shall be regarded as having been effectively dealt with by any such order, direction, decision or instruction dealing with property, rights or interests in which they may be interested, whether or not their interests are specifically mentioned therein.\n(3) No question shall be raised as to the regularity of a transfer of any property, rights or interests dealt with in pursuance of any such order, direction, decision or instruction. (4) The provisions of this section shall not be held to prejudice any title to property heretofore acquired in good faith and for value and in accordance with the Canadian law by a British subject or by a national of any of the Powers allied or associated during the war with His Majesty.\n39. No transfer, whether for valuable consideration or not, made after the sixth day of May, 1916, without the leave of some competent authority in Canada, by or on behalf of an enemy as defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 32 of any securities shall confer on the transfer any rights or remedies in respect thereof and no company or municipality or other body by whom the securities were issued or are managed shall take any cognizance of or otherwise act upon any notice of such transfer.\nSo far as s-s. 4 of s. 34 is concerned, when the appellant purchased the shares in May and October, 1918, he was a German national and, in any event, his acquired French nationality dated only from November 11, 1918. Furthermore, he did not acquire any title in good faith and for value in accordance with Canadian law.\nFor the reasons given, the shares may not be taken out of the custody and control of the Custodian and the action fails. However, in view of the alteration in the wording of paragraph 33 of The Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920, as effected by P.C. 267 of 1924, whereby the words \"shall belong to Canada\" were omitted so as to comply with the Treaty of Versailles, the judgment appealed from should be amended by striking out the words \"belong to Canada and\". With this variation, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the claimant: Auguste Lemieux.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McLaren, Laidlaw, Corlett & Sherwood.\n1 [1939] Ex.

Powell Intervenants.\n1953: May 12, 13, 14; 1953: October 6.\nPresent: Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand, Kellock, Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE BRITISH COLUMBIA COURT OF APPEAL\nCompanies\u2014Offer by company to buy shares of another\u2014Period offer to be open for acceptance under The Companies Act (Can.)\u2014Compliance with terms of s. 124 (1) prerequisite to obtaining court order compelling acceptance\u2014The Companies Act, 1934 (Can.) c. 33, s. 124 (1).\nS. 124 (1) of The Companies Act, 1934 (Can.) c. 33, provides that where when any contract involving the transfer of shares in one company has within four months after the making of the offer been approved by the holders of not less than nine-tenths of the shares affected, the transferee company may, at any time within two months after the expiration of the said four months give notice in such manner as may be prescribed by the court, to any dissenting shareholder that it desires to acquire his shares, and where such notice is given the transferee shall, unless on an application made by the dissenting shareholder within one month from the date on which the notice was given the court thinks fit to order otherwise, be entitled and bound to acquire those shares on the terms on which, under the contract, the shares of the approving shareholders are to be transferred to the company.\nThe respondent Trust company, acting on behalf of an undisclosed principal, on Dec. 1, 1950, made an offer to the shareholder of the common stock of the respondent pulp and paper company to purchase their shares at $200 per share, subject to the offer being accepted by Dec. 15, 1950 by the holders of not less than 90 per cent of the shares. It further provided that it should not be bound to accept or pay for any shares not deposited with it by that date. The holders of more than the required percentage accepted and complied with the terms of the offer, but the appellant did not, nor did the intervenants. On April 15, 1951 upon application of the respondents, Coady J. made an order under s. 124 (1) of the Act authorizing the Trust company to notify the shareholders who had not accepted the offer that it desired to acquire their shares under its terms and that, unless upon an application made by any of them within one month from the date upon which notice was given them the court should otherwise order, the Trust company would be entitled to acquire their shares on such terms. The appellant then brought action naming the respondents as defendants, claiming a declaration that the Trust company was neither entitled nor bound to purchase his shares, nor the plaintiff bound to sell or transfer them to it, and that s. 124 was ultra vires, and alternatively that its provisions did not apply to the plaintiffs' shares. He also moved for an order setting aside the ex parte order made by Coady J. The latter dismissed the action and the motion. An appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia was also dismissed.\nHeld: That the language of s. 124 (1) of The Companies Act contemplates that the offer shall be open for acceptance for a period of four months after its making by those to whom it is made. Where the offer, as in this case, does not comply with the terms of the subsection, the offeror is not entitled to invoke the assistance of the court to compel the dissentients to transfer their shares.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (1952) 6 W.W.R. (N.S.) 652, reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Coady J. [2], who dismissed the appellant's (plaintiff's) action. By orders of various judges in chamber, the Attorney General for Canada, Chartered Trust Co., and W. W. Powell were permitted to intervene.\nM. M. Grosman, Q.C. and C. F. Scott for appellant.\nA. S. Gregory for the respondents.\nF. P. Varcoe, Q.C. and K. E. Eaton for the Attorney General of Canada, intervenant.\nTerence Sheard, Q.C. for the Chartered Trust Co., intervenant.\nW. H. Powell, intervenant, in person.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Kellock, Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:\nLOCKE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, by which the appeal of the present appellant from a judgment of Coady, J. in the action brought by the appellant under the provisions of s. 124 of the Dominion Companies Act was dismissed. As it was contended both in the action and upon the motion that the section was ultra vires the Parliament of Canada, the Attorney-General of Canada intervened in the proceedings in this Court. Mr. W. H. Powell, a holder of common shares in the British Columbia Pulp and Paper Company Limited, and the Chartered Trust Company as trustee of the property of W. F. Bald, deceased, were by orders of this Court permitted to intervene.\nThe British Columbia Pulp and Paper Company Limited was incorporated by letters patent under the Companies Act of Canada on December 24, 1925, and has since that time carried on extensive operations in the production of pulp and and allied products in the Province of British Columbia. Its head office is at the City of Vancouver.\nOn December 1, 1950, the authorised capital of the company was 150,000 shares of common stock without nominal par value and 10,000 shares of redeemable preference stock of the par value of $100 each. Prior to December 1, 1950, 100,000 of the common shares had been issued and were in the hands of 243 shareholders. On that date, Montreal Trust Company addressed to each of these shareholders an offer to purchase their shares which read as follows:\u2014\nMONTREAL TRUST COMPANY\nExecutors and Trustees\n15 King Street West,\nToronto 1, Ont.\nDecember 1, 1950.\nTO THE HOLDERS OF COMMON SHARES OF BRITISH COLUMBIA PULP & PAPER COMPANY, LIMITED:\nMontreal Trust Company (hereinafter called the \"Trust Company\") hereby offers to purchase at $200 cash per share flat, Canadian funds, less transfer taxes, all the outstanding common shares (hereinafter called the \"shares\") in the capital stock of British Columbia Pulp & Paper Company, Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of Canada (hereinafter called the \"company\").\nThis offer is subject to the following conditions:\n1. That it shall have been accepted on or before December 15, 1950 in the manner hereinafter provided by the holders of not less than ninety per cent (90%) of the shares.\n2. That acceptance of this offer can be made by you only by depositing with any office of the Trust Company in Canada your certificate or certificates for shares duly endorsed in blank for transfer with signature guaranteed by a bank or trust company or a member of a recognized stock exchange together with a letter of transmittal in the form enclosed duly completed and singed. The conditions of this paragraph 2 may be waived in whole or in part by the Trust Company.\nUpon acceptance of this offer within the time aforesaid by the holders of not less than ninety per cent (90%) of the shares, the Trust Company will forthwith make payment for such shares. Failing acceptance of this offer within the time aforesaid by the holders of not less than ninety per cent (90%) of the shares, the shares certificates deposited will thereupon be returned by teh Trust Company to the persons depositing the same. The Trust Company may, but shall not be bound to accept deposit of or to pay for any shares not deposited on or before December 15, 1950. All payments for the shares shall be made by cheque negotiable without charge at all Canadian Branches of The Royal Bank of Canada.\nShareholders who wish to forwared their certificates by mail are advised to use registered post for their protection.\nThe Canadian Foreign Exchanges Control Board has approved of the making of this offer. It is understood, however, that shareholders who are resident in the United States dollar area countries and who wish to accept this offer by depositing their shares in accordance with its terms will be required to re-invest the purchase price payable hereunder in appropriate Canadian domestic securities.\nYours very truly,\nMONTREAL TRUST COMPANY.\nIt was found as a fact by the learned trial Judge that on or before December 15, 1950, the holders of more than 90 per cent of these shares accepted the offer.\nS. 124 of The Companies Act, 1934, reads as follows:\u2014\n124. (1) Where any contract involving the transfer of shares or any class of shares in a company (in this section referred to as \"the transferor company\") to any other company (in this section referred to as \"the transferee company\") has, within four months after the making of the offer in that behalf by the transferee company, been approved by the holders of not less than nine-tenths of the shares affected, or not less than nine-tenths of each class of shares affected if more than one class of shares is affected, the transferee company may, at any time within two months after the expiration of the said four months, give notice, in such manner as may be prescribed by the court in the province in which the head office of the transferor company is situate, to any dissenting shareholder that it desires to acquire his shares, and where such notice is given the transferee company shall, unless on an application made by the dissenting shareholder within one month from the date on which the notice was given the court thinks fit to order otherwise, be entitled and bound to acquire those shares on the terms on which, under the contract, the shares of the approving shareholders are to be transferred to the transferee company.\nProvided that, where any contract has been so approved at any time before the coming into force of this Act, the court may by order, on an application made to it by the transferee company within two months after the coming into force of this Act, authorize notice to be given under this section at any time within fourteen days after the making of the order, and this section shall apply accordingly, except that the terms on which the shares of the dissenting shareholder are to be acquired shall be on such terms as the court may by order direct, instead of the terms provided by the contract. The terms substituted by order of the court as aforesaid shall not be such as to deprive the dissenting shareholder, without his consent, of the right to receive any dividends declared and unpaid on his shares or any unpaid cumulative preferential dividend on those shares whether declared or not accrued or accruing up to the date of the acquisition of those shares by the transferee company, but any provision made for the preservation of such right shall be taken into account in determining such substituted terms.\n(2) Where a notice has been so given and the court has not ordered to the contrary, the transferee company shall, on the expiration of one month from the date on which the notice was given, or, if an application to the court by the dissenting shareholder is then pending, after the application has been disposed of transmit a copy of the notice to the transferor company and pay or transfer to the transferor company the amount or other consideration representing the price payable by the transferee company for the shares which by virtue of this section it is entitled to acquire, and the transferor company shall thereupon register the transferee company as the holder of those shares.\n(3) Any sums so received by the transferor company shall be paid into a separate bank account in a chartered bank in Canada and such sums and any other consideration so received shall be held by the transferor company in trust for the several persons entitled to the shares in respect of which the said sums or other consideration were respectively received.\n(4) In this section the expression \"contract\" includes an offer of exchange and any plan or arrangement, whether contained in or evidenced by one or more documents, whereby or pursuant to which the transferee company has become or may become entitled or bound absolutely or conditionally to acquire all the shares in the transferor company of any one or more classes of shareholders who accept or have accepted the offer or who assent to or have assented to the plan or arrangement; and the expression \"dissenting shareholder\" includes a shareholder who has not accepted the offer or assented to the plan or arrangement and any shareholder who has failed or refused to transfer his shares to the transferee company in accordance with the contract.\nThe appellant had become the registered owner of 25 of the common shares on November 30, 1950, and did not accept the offer and it was not accepted by the intervenants Powell and the Chartered Trust Company. On April 5, 1951, upon the application of Montreal Trust Company and British Columbia Pulp and Paper Company Limited, Coady, J., acting under the provisions of s-s. 1 of s. 124, made an order authorising the Trust Company to give notice to such of the holders of the common shares who had not accepted the offer, advising them that it desired to acquire the shares on the terms of the offer and settling the form of the written notice to be given. It was a term of the order that unless, upon an application made to the Court by any of these shareholders within one month from the date upon which notice was given to him as directed, the Court should otherwise order, the Montreal Trust Company should be entitled and bound to acquire the said shares on the terms of the offer and should pay to the British Columbia Pulp and Paper Company Limited, or the several persons entitled thereto, the money representing the price payable for the shares in accordance with those terms.\nOn May 2, 1951, the appellant issued a writ in which the Trust Company and the Paper Company were named as defendants, the endorsement claiming, inter alia, a declaration that the Trust Company was neither entitled nor bound to purchase the shares of the appellant and that the plaintiff was not bound to sell or transfer them to the Trust Company, for a declaration that s. 124 of the Companies Act was ultra vires the Parliament of Canada, and alternatively, a declaration that the provisions of the section did not apply to the shares owned by the plaintiff. The appellant obtained special leave to serve with the writ a notice of a motion to be made on June 5, 1951, for judgment in the terms of the endorsement. Notice of this motion was given to the Attorneys-General of Canada and of the Province of British Columbia. In addition, the appellant gave notice of a further motion in the original proceedings for an order setting aside the ex parte order made by Coady, J. on April 5 on the grounds, inter alia, that s. 124 was ultra vires and that there had been no jurisdiction to make the order and notice of this application was also given to the Attorneys-General. These applications came on for hearing together. Neither of the Attorneys-General were represented. Coady, J. dismissed the action and the motion.\nThe first matter to be considered is as to whether the proceedings taken by the Montreal Trust Company were in accordance with the provisions of s. 124. In a matter involving what amounts to a forced sale of the shares of the dissentients, there must clearly be strict compliance with the terms of the section. S. 124 first appeared in the Dominion Companies Act 1934. Other than that part of s-s. 4 which defines certain of the meanings to be attributed to the word \"contract\" in s-s. 1, the section was taken almost verbatim from s. 50 of the Companies Act 1928 (Imp.) which amended in this respect the Companies (Consolidation) Act 1908. That section was carried into the Companies Act of 1929 as s. 155 and, with certain amendments and additions, is now s. 209 of the Companies Act, 1948. The offer of the Montreal Trust Company, it is to be noted, was made subject to the condition that it should be accepted in the manner specified on or before a date fourteen days after the date of the offer by the holders of not less than 90 per cent of the shares. As to those who did not accept within that time, the offer read:\u2014\nThe Trust Company may, but shall not be bound, to accept deposit of or to pay for any shares not deposited on or before December 15, 1950.\nThe appellant contends that such an offer is not within the terms of the section. For the respondents it is said that, since it was shown that within two weeks it was accepted by the holders of more than 90 per cent of the shares, they are entitled to invoke the provisions of the first paragraph of s-s. 1 for the compulsory acquisition of the shares of those who did not accept the offer. The point was carefully considered by Mr. Justice Coady, who was of the opinion that an offer open only for this limited period complied with the requirements of the section. With great respect, I am unable to agree. The Trust Company's offer was open for acceptance for a period of two weeks only: for the remainder of the four month period after the making of the offer the company might, at its option, decline to purchase the shares of any of those who had not accepted on or before December 15, 1950. In my opinion, the language of s-s. 1:\u2014\nWhere any contract involving the transfer of shares or any class of shares in a company\u2026 to any other company\u2026 has, within four months after the making of the offer in that behalf by the transferee company, been approved by the holders of not less than nine-tenths of the shares affected\u2026\ncontemplates that the offer shall be open for acceptance for the period of four months by those to whom it has been made. The procedure authorised by the first paragraph of s-s. 1 enables the transferee company, if the offer is not accepted, to apply to the Court for an order that the dissenting shareholders transfer the shares on the terms of the offer. The intention of Parliament in providing that such an application could not be made until four months after the making of the offer was, in my opinion, to enable the shareholders to make such investigation as they might think advisable to enable them to determine whether the offer was fair and one that they wished to accept. I cannot think that it was contemplated that the offeror might limit the period within which the offeree might make these inquiries in such manner as might suit his own convenience. If the time for acceptance might be limited to two weeks, it might, of course, be limited to a much shorter period and afford the shareholders a wholly inadequate opportunity to make such inquiries as they saw fit to make before deciding upon the acceptance or rejection of the offer.\nAs, in my opinion, the offer made did not comply with the terms of the subsection, the respondents were not entitled to invoke the assistance of the Court to compel the dissentients to transfer their shares.\nI express no opinion as to any of the other questions which were so fully argued before us.\nI would allow this appeal with costs throughout and set aside the judgments of the Court of Appeal and of the learned trial Judge and direct that judgment be entered in the action granting the relief claimed in Paragraph (e) of the endorsement on the writ. No order upon the substantive motion should be made.\nI would make no order as to the costs of the intervenants.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Rand, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nRAND J.:\u2014In this appeal both the interpretation and the constitutional validity of s. 124 of the Dominion Companies Act have been raised: but the view at which I have arrived on the former dispenses with a consideration of the latter.\nThe section reads:\u2014\nWhere any contract involving the transfer of shares or any class of shares in a company \u2026to any other company\u2026 has within four months after the making of the offer in that behalf\u2026 been approved by the holders of not less than nine-tenths of the shares affected\u2026 the transferee company may, at any time within two months after the expiration of the four months, give notice\u2026 to any dissenting shareholder that it desires to acquire his shares, and where such notice is given the transferee company shall, unless on an application made by the dissenting shareholder within one month from the date on which the notice was given the court thinks fit to order otherwise, be entitled and bound to acquire those shares on the terms on which, under the contract, the shares of the approving shareholders are to be transferred to the transferee company. If no application is made by the dissenting shareholder, the transferee company, on transmitting to the transferor company a copy of the notice and paying or transferring the amount of money or other consideration to be given for the shares, is entitled to have them registered in its name. Provision is made for placing sums so received into a separate bank account to be held in trust for the persons entitled. The word \"contract\" is defined to include an\noffer of exchange and any plan or arrangement\u2026 pursuant to which the transferee company has become or may become entitled or bound absolutely or conditionally to acquire all the shares in the transferor company of any one or more classes of shareholders who accept or have accepted the offer or who assent or have assented to the plan or arrangement; and \"dissenting shareholder\" includes one who has not accepted the offer or assented to the plan or arrangement as well as one who has failed or refused to transfer his shares to the transferee company in accordance with the contract.\nThe language of this section, which appears within a fasciculus headed, \"Arrangements and Compromises\", may have been clear to the draftsman, but I confess that it presents to me many difficulties of construction. What, for instance, does the word \"contract\", even including an \"offer of exchange and any plan or arrangement\", mean? With whom is the contract made? Certainly not with the shareholders; both the singular number and the fact that their individual acceptances would be necessary exclude that; and I doubt that the word \"exchange\", although in one sense including purchase, is an exemplary use of language. Then the contract, within four months after the \"making of the offer\", is to be \"approved\". If the offer is to be made direct to the shareholders, it is quite impossible to say that in the ordinary case it could be made on a particular day from which the four months would be computed; and the word \"approved\" is quite out of place if used in relation to such an offer. By s-s. (2), the transferor company is to change the register upon receipt of a copy of a notice sent out to the dissenting shareholder, which would be an extraordinary mode of dealing with registered titles were that copy the only matter of record before the transferor company.\nIn view of these difficulties, I am bound to interpret the section as contemplating, in the practical working out of a business scheme, an offer or plan or arrangement submitted by the proposed transferee to the transferor company and by the latter to its shareholders for approval. That was the course pursued in In re Evertite Locknuts Ld. [3]; and In re Press Caps Ld. [4], the proposal was accompanied by a letter from the directors to the shareholders recommending acceptance. In that way the date of the \"making of the offer\" is fixed by its delivery to the transferor company; meaning is given to the word \"approved\"; and the notice to the dissenting shareholder as received by the transferor takes its place in the records of that company as arising out of the proposal already received.\nThe proposal must also remain open for approval by any shareholder for the four months mentioned, otherwise the postponement of the right to proceed by notice against the dissenting shareholder until after the expiration of that period would scarcely make sense. I should say, too, that every shareholder who approved the proposal would be entitled to compel the transferee to purchase his shares, but there seems to be no obligation to acquire shares of dissenting shareholders.\nThis comparatively new power by which a majority may coerce a minority is one to be exercised in good faith and with the controlling facts available to shareholders to enable them to come to a decision one way or the other. In most, at least, of the cases which have reached the courts in England, the circumstances showed a straightforward transaction with its business considerations made evident to the shareholders. The analogy which obviously suggests itself is that of the sale of a company's undertaking. Such a power has long been accorded companies, and the equivalent transfer by way of share acquisition presents no greater objection in principle except in relation to individual shareholders. One can easily imagine resort to s. 124 for a purely arbitrary acquisition of shares of a small interest by a larger one, but I cannot think the provision was introduced for any such a purpose; and it is significant that it is to a company and not an individual that the power is given.\nThe proposal here was made without reference either to s. 124 or to the Act or to the transferor company: it was made direct by the transferee to the shareholders; there was therefore nothing to indicate that those who disregarded the offer might be exposed to a compulsory divesting of their property. Its offer to buy was one that could have been made at any time regardless of the statute. Dated December 1, 1950, instead of being open to the shareholders for approval for the period of four months, it was to be accepted on or before December 15, 1950 by the holders of not less than 90 per cent of the shares or it would lapse; and to put that beyond doubt, the proposal added that in relation to any acceptances received after December 15 the company reserved the right to reject them. The date of the offer is assumed to be December 1, but obviously that cannot be the time of its receipt by those to whom it was addressed: the list of shareholders shows that three were residents of the sterling area, nine of the United States, and the remainder of Canada, and certainly the mailing date cannot be taken to be the date of an offer to all. The applicant has, rather, proceeded on the view that all that was necessary for the giving of notice was the ownership of the required percentage of the shares.\nThere is also the point raised by Mr. Sheard that the proposal was made by a trust company and we are asked, in view of the nature of the company, to draw the inference that it was acting for an undisclosed principal. It was pointed out that of the 100,000 shares issued, 79,161 were owned by five of a total of 244 shareholders. Nothing is indicated of the interest of these persons in the trust or other purchasing company, and it is difficult to say that that fact could not, in the situation here, be a material consideration. That the shareholders are entitled to know the company which in reality is proposing to buy or exchange appears to me to be undoubted. In the present circumstances, however, I do not treat this feature as material to the determination of the appeal and it is unnecessary to examine it further.\nThe question, then, is whether the failure to conform with the procedure envisaged by the section, notwithstanding that the trust company has acquired over 90 per cent of the shares, is fatal to its claim to the benefit of the coercive effect of the section. Is the mere fact of possessing the required percentage sufficient to justify, in this case, such a departure from the procedural requirements? In my opinion, that procedure cannot be disregarded or modified because of the special circumstances of a proposal. The language contemplates various forms of schemes or arrangements, and we have before us the simplest of them; but I can see no reason why a departure in this case would not justify a like departure in any case. Here is the exercise of a power by which an individual's property may be taken from him, possibly by a fellow shareholder and a more complete negation of the terms upon which originally, at least, individuals entered into the association of company membership can hardly be imagined. Since the applicant specifically intimated that the acquisition of all the shares was not vital to its proposal, it cannot be taken that shares now outstanding can, in the slightest manner, affect the exercise of the substantial control that was sought. If the property of the minority shareholder is to be taken from him without his consent, then on a principle as old as the common law, the steps prescribed must be strictly followed. As that has not been done here, the applicant has not brought itself within the conditions necessary to the exercise of the compulsory power of acquisition.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and direct an order that the applicant is not entitled to acquire the shares of the appellant. The latter will have his costs throughout.\nThere will be no costs to the intervenants.\nAppeal allowed with costs to appellant throughout. No costs to or against the intervenants.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Grossman & Sharp.\nSolicitor for the respondents: A. S.

Sun Publishing Co. [1953] 2 S.C.R. 216\nDate: 1953-06-26\nYvonne Guay (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nSun Publishing Company Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1952: October 30, 31, November 3; 1953: June 26.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Estey, Locke and Cartwright JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nTort\u2014Negligence\u2014Newspaper\u2014Negligent misstatement\u2014False report of death of husband and children\u2014Whether actionable by wife\u2014Absence of malice\u2014Whether duty owed\u2014Nervous shock\u2014Whether damages recoverable.\nThe respondent published in one issue of its daily newspaper printed in Vancouver, a news item stating that the appellant's husband and their three children had been killed in an automobile accident in Ontario where they were living. No such accident had taken place but the appellant read the item and claimed that the resulting shock affected her health. The respondent could not explain its publication. The appellant claimed damages for negligence and did not allege fraud or malice or the existence of any contractual relationship. The action was maintained by the trial judge but dismissed by a majority in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.\nHeld: (Rinfret C.J. and Cartwright J. dissenting), that the appeal and the action should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin J.: Since there was no duty in law owed by the respondent to the appellant, the former could not be held liable in negligence for the shock and impairment in health suffered by the appellant as a result of reading the report. The appellant was not a \"neighbour\" of the respondent within the meaning of Lord Atkin's statement in Donoghue v. Stevenson ([1932] A.C. 562), since she was not a person so closely and directly affected by the publishing of the report that the respondent ought reasonably to have had the appellant in contemplation as being affected injuriously when it was directing its mind to the act of publishing.\nPer Estey J.: Assuming that the respondent owed a duty to the appellant to exercise reasonable care to verify the truth of the report, because injury would be foreseeable to a reasonable person, the appellant cannot succeed since the evidence does not establish that she suffered physical illness or other injury consequent upon shock or emotional disturbance caused by a reading of the report.\nPer Locke J.: Since it was conceded on behalf of the appellant that the respondent had acted without malice in publishing the article believing the statements made to be true, there was no cause of action, even though the respondent had acted carelessly in falling, before publication, to make adequate inquiries as to their truth, and damage has resulted. Dickson v. Reuter's Telegram Co. (1877) L.R. 3 C.P. 1; Derry. v. Peek (1889) 14 App. Cas. 366; Nocton v. Ashburton [1914] A.C. 932; Angus v. Clifford [1891] 2 Ch. D. 449; Le Lievre v. Gould [1893] 1 Q.B. 491; Balden v. Shorter [1933] 1 Ch. 427 and Chandler v. Crane [1951] 2 K.B. 164. Nothing decided in Donoghue v. Stevenson [1932] A.C. 562 affected the question to be determined. Per Rinfret C.J. and Cartwright J. (dissenting): There is no analogy between the present case and an action for damages for misrepresentation or for injurious falsehood; the present case is analogous to a case in which the respondent has unintentionally but negligently struck the appellant or caused some object to strike her. The respondent, as a reasonable man, should have foreseen the probability of the appellant reading the report and suffering injury as a result. (Donoghue v. Stevenson [1932] A.C. 562 and Hambrook v. Stokes Bros. [1925] 1 K.B. applied). Therefore a duty rested upon the respondent to check the accuracy of the report before publishing it.\n2. The respondent failed in that duty.\n3. The appellant can recover damages for nervous shock even though there was no physical impact (Hay or Bourhill v. Young [1943] A.C. 92).\n4. The evidence as to damages does not warrant an interference with the assessment made by the trial judge.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (1), reversing, O'Halloran J.A. dissenting, the decision of the trial judge and dismissing the action for injurious falsehood.\nD.

Brown for the respondent.\nThe dissenting judgment of the Chief Justice and of Cartwright J. was delivered by:\u2014\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal, brought by special leave granted by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, from a judgment of that court [1]reversing, by a majority, the judgment of Wood J. in favour of the appellant for $1,025 and costs and directing that the action be dismissed. O'Halloran J.A., dissenting, would have dismissed the appeal and on the cross-appeal would have increased the damages to $3,275.\nThe material facts may be summarized as follows. The appellant is a married woman. In February 1948 she was living, separate from her husband, in the City of Vancouver. Her husband was living with their three children in Northern Ontario. The respondent publishes a daily newspaper in the City of Vancouver. On the 3rd February 1948, the defendant published the following item in its newspaper:\u2014\nEx-Vancouver Man, Children\nKilled in Crash.\nA former Vancouver man and his three children were killed in an antomobile-train collision in Northern Ontario over the weekend, according to word received by relatives here.\nMrs. R. C. Guay, 1972 West Sixth, said today she and her husband had been notified that her husband's brother, Dick Guay, his daughter and two sons, are all dead.\nThe wife of the dead man is believed to be in Vancouver, Mrs. Guay said.\nMr. Guay left Vancouver last June and has been living in North Bay. The accident occurred when he was motoring with the three children from Timmins to North Bay. The news of the tragedy was sent here by another brother who lives in Ontario.\nThe statement that Mr. Guay and the children had been killed was untrue. They had not been concerned in any accident. It was true, however, that the appellant's husband was known as Dick Guay, that he had a brother whose name was R. C. Guay, that he had another brother living in Ontario and that the children were a daughter and two sons. The evidence does not disclose where R. C. Guay was living at the time of the publication but there is nothing to suggest he was living in Vancouver. It is clear that neither Mr. nor Mrs. R. C. Guay lived at the address mentioned, 1972 West Sixth. There is no evidence as to how or by whom the item was furnished to the respondent. It seems to be a reasonable inference that it was concocted by someone, acquainted with the affairs of the appellant and her husband, who wished to hurt the appellant.\nOn the day on which the item was published the appellant, in accordance with her usual custom, purchased a copy of the respondent's newspaper, read the item, believed it, and suffered from severe shock which somewhat seriously affected her health. She required treatment by two doctors, extending over some months, was prevented from carrying on her customary work and suffered a partial disability of indefinite duration.\nIt is conceded that there was neither malice nor fraud on the part of the defendant. The appellant claims damages for negligence. She does not allege the existence of any contractual relationship between herself and the respondent. The learned trial judge was of opinion that under the principles stated in Donoghue v. Stevenson[2], and Hay or Bourhill v. Young[3], the respondent owed a duty to the appellant which it failed to perform, that such failure caused the injuries suffered by her and that she was accordingly entitled to judgment. The majority in the Court of Appeal were of opinion that the respondent would be under no liability unless it had acted wilfully or maliciously and consequently did not find it necessary to decide whether or not it had been negligent.\nThe following questions were argued before us. (i) Under the circumstances, did the respondent owe a duty to the appellant to be careful? The appellant submits that it did. The respondent submits that it owed no duty to the appellant other than a duty not to publish false news, which might injure her, wilfully, fraudulently or maliciously. (ii) If the respondent was under a duty to the appellant to take care, was there a breach of such duty? (iii) Even if the foregoing questions are answered in favour of the appellant could she recover damages for nervous shock unaccompanied by any physical impact? and (iv) The quantum of damages.\nIt is first necessary to observe that the cause of action alleged by the appellant is based on negligence regarded as a specific tort in itself. In Grant v. Australian Knitting Mills Ltd. [4], Lord Wright, who delivered the judgment of the Judicial Committee, discusses the judgments in Donoghue's case (supra) and says at page 103:\u2014\nIt is clear that the decision treats negligence, where there is a duty to take care, as a specific tort in itself, and not simply as an element in some more complex relationship or in some specialized breach of duty, and still less as having any dependence on contract. All that is necessary as a step to establish the tort of actionable negligence is to define the precise relationship from which the duty to take care is to be deduced. It is, however, essential in English law that the duty should be established: the mere fact that a man is injured by another's act gives in itself no cause of action: if the act is deliberate, the party injured will have no claim in law even though the injury is intentional, so long as the other party is merely exercising a legal right: if the act involves lack of due care, again no case of actionable negligence will arise unless the duty to be careful exists. The learned trial judge refers to the often quoted passage in the judgment of Lord Atkin in Donoghue's case (supra) at page 580:\u2014\nAt present I content myself with pointing out that in English law there must be, and is, some general conception of relations giving rise to a duty of care, of which the particular cases found in the books are but instances. The liability for negligence, whether you style it such or treat it as in the other systems as a species of 'culpa', is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay. But acts or omissions which any moral code would censure cannot in a practical world be treated so as to give a right to every person injured by them to demand relief. In this way rules of law arise which limit the range of complainants and the extent of their remedy. The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer's question, who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably forsee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law is my neighbour? The answer seems to be\u2014persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question.\nThe learned trial judge proceeds:\u2014\nAs I stated above, the article in the newspaper indicated that the wife and mother whose husband and children were supposed to have been killed lived in Vancouver and she naturally would read or at least hear of the article. Surely, therefore, she was the defendant's neighbour.\nIn Hay or Bourhill v. Young (supra) at page 111, Lord Wright points out \"that the issue of duty or no duty is, indeed, a question for the court, but it depends on the view taken of the facts.\" The judgments of all the Law Lords who took part in the last mentioned case appear to me to establish that in determining this issue of duty or no duty it is material to consider what the defendant ought to have contemplated as a reasonable man, and that, prima facie at least, a duty to take care arises towards those individuals as to whom a reasonable man in the position of the defendant would have anticipated that they would be injured by the omission to take such care.\nFor the reasons given by the learned trial judge and by O'Halloran J.A. I am of opinion that a reasonable man in the position of the respondent would have foreseen the probability of the appellant reading the news item and suffering serious injury as a result and that consequently a duty rested upon the respondent to take care to check its authenticity before publishing it; unless, as is argued for the respondent, the authorities negative such a duty where the act complained of is the speaking or writing of words. Counsel for the respondent contends that Donoghue's case has never so far been applied to negligence in words and that it has uniformly been held that fraud or malice is an essential ingredient of a cause of action for damages based on words spoken or written. He does not suggest any analogy between the case at bar and an action for defamation but argues that it is similar to actions for damages for misrepresentation or for injurious falsehood. In my view it is analogous to neither. The gist of the former is the making of false statements to the plaintiff whereby he is induced to act to his own loss; and that of the latter, is the making of false statements to others concerning the plaintiff whereby he suffers loss through the action of those others.\nIn my view the case at bar is an action on the case for negligently inflicting injury to the person of the appellant and thereby causing injury to her health, and is closely analogous to, if not identical with, a case in which the defendant has unintentionally but negligently struck the appellant or caused some object to strike him. In principle I find it difficult to assert that a defendant who unintentionally but carelessly injures an appellant by a blow or an electric shock should be under liability but a defendant who causes a similar, and perhaps much more serious, injury to an appellant by carelessly inflicting a mental shock by the use of words should escape liability.\nI find it unnecessary to attempt to choose between the view of the majority and that of Denning L.J. in Candler v. Crane Christmas and Co.[5], which was, in essence, an action for damages for misrepresentation, as I have already expressed my view that the cause of action in the case at bar differs in kind from that in a case where the appellant's loss is due to his having been induced to act to his loss by representations made by the defendant. For similar reasons I can derive little assistance from the judgment in Shapiro v. La Morta [6], and Balden v. Shorter [7], both of which were actions for injurious falsehood.\nTwo cases, Wilkinson v. Downton [8], and Janvier v. Sweeney [9], resemble the case at bar in several respects. In the former Wright J., and in the latter the Court of Appeal, held that damages were recoverable for illne resulting from shock caused by words spoken directly by the defendant to the plaintiff; but in both cases the defendant knew when speaking the words that they were a false so that the element of wilfulness, which is lacking in the case at bar, was present. In Janvier v. Sweeney the Court of Appeal approved the decision in Wilkinson v. Downton, and speaking of that decision Bankes L.J., said at pages 321 and 322:\u2014\nIn my view that judgment was right. It has been approved in subsequent cases. It did not create any new rule of law, though it may be said to have extended existing principles over an area wider than that which they had been recognized as covering, because the Court there accepted the view that the damage there relied on was not in the circumstances too remote in the eye of the law. The substance of that decision may be found in the following passage from the judgment of Wright J. After referring to the doctrine of Pasley v. Freeman and Langridge v. Levy the learned judge said: \"I am not sure that this would not be an extension of that doctrine, the real ground of which appears, to be that a person who makes a false statement intended to be acted on must make good the damage naturally resulting from its being acted on. Here there is no injuria of that kind. I think, however, that the verdict may be supported upon another ground. The defendant has, as I assume for the moment, wilfully done an act calculated to cause physical harm to the plaintiff\u2014that is to say, to infringe her legal right to personal safety, and has in fact thereby caused physical harm to her. That proposition without more appears to me to state a good cause of action, there being no justification alleged for the act. This wilful injuria is in law malicious, although no malicious purpose to cause the harm which was caused nor any motive of spite is imputed to the defendant.\"\nIn Dulieu v. White and Sons [10], the plaintiff suffered illness as a result of nervous shock caused by the defendant's servant negligently driving a van into the public-house of the plaintiff's husband while the plaintiff was behind the bar. There was no actual impact upon the person of the plaintiff. It was held she was entitled to recover damages. Phillimore J. said at page 682:\nI think there may be cases in which A owes a duty to B not to inflict a mental shock on him or her, and that in such a case, if A does inflict such a shock upon B\u2014as by terrifying B\u2014and physical damage thereby ensues, B may have an action for the physical damage, though the medium through which it has been inflicted is the mind.\nand at page 683:\u2014\nI cordially accept the decision of my brother Wright in Wilkinson v. Downton that every one has a legal right to his personal safety, and that it is a tort to destroy this safety by wilfully false statements and thereby to cause a physical injury to the sufferer. In that case it will be observed that the only physical action of the wrong-doer was that of speech. Dulieu v. White and Sons was approved by the Court of Appeal in Hambrook v. Stokes Bros.[11], in which damages were recovered for injuries caused to the plaintiff's wife by shock caused by the defendants negligently permitting their unattended lorry to rush down a steep hill, the shock being caused by the wife's fear, not for her own safety, but for that of her children. It will be observed that in both of these cases there was no element of wilfulness or malice, but the shock was administered by the instrumentality of a vehicle, not of words.\nI share the view of O'Halloran J.A. and the learned trial judge that the American decisions to which counsel referred are not of great assistance as they do not discuss the problem in the light of the principles laid down in Donoghue's case, and for this reason I refrain from a detailed examination of them.\nWhile it is true, as is pointed out by Lord Haldane in Nocton v. Ashburton [12], that \"liability for negligence in word has in material respects been developed in our law differently from liability for negligence in act\" I can find no reason for refusing to apply the principles stated in the passage from Lord Atkin's speech in Donoghue's case, quoted above, to the case of a false statement communicated directly by a defendant to a plaintiff in such circumstances that a reasonable man in the position of the defendant would have foreseen the probability of the mere communication causing a serious shock with resulting injury to the health of the plaintiff. Wrottesley J. in Old Gate Estates v. Toplis [13], expresses the view that the application of Donoghue's case is confined to negligence which results in danger to life, danger to limb or danger to health. It is not necessary to decide whether this is always so but in my view Donoghue's case should apply to the particular facts of the case at bar where what the respondent should have foreseen was the probability of danger to the health of the appellant. The circumstance that in Dulieu v. White and Sons and in Hambrook v. Stokes Bros. the shock was caused by negligently presenting a vehicle to the view of the person shocked in such circumstances as to terrify her while in the case at bar the shock was caused by negligently presenting the false news item to the appellant does not seem to me to be a satisfactory ground for affirming liability in the one case and denying it in the other. I cannot distinguish in principle between liability for nervous shock caused to a mother by carelessly allowing a truck to run away and so to cause her to think that it will injure her children and liability for nervous shock caused to her by carelessly communicating a false statement to her which will cause her to believe that all her children have met a violent death. Indeed, in my opinion, the probability of injurious shock to the claimant would be more readily foreseen in the latter instance than in the former.\nIn my opinion Hambrook v. Stokes Bros. rightly decides that the right to recover damages which result from nervous shock negligently caused to the plaintiff is not limited to cases in which the shock arises from a reasonable fear of immediate personal injury to the plaintiff. It is true that that decision has not been finally passed upon by the House of Lords. It was dealt with in all the judgments delivered in Hay or Bourhill v. Young (supra). Lord Thankerton and Lord Macmillan reserved their opinion in regard to it. Lord Russell of Killowen said that he preferred the dissenting judgment of Sargant L.J. to the decision of the majority but that the judgment of the House did not amount to a disapproval of that decision. Lord Wright stated that as at present advised he agreed with it. Lord Porter refers to it as showing the high water mark reached in claims of the character under discussion, and explains the dissent of Sargant L.J. as being based on the view that the injury complained of could not reasonably have been anticipated and therefore the defendant had broken no duty which he owed to the plaintiff. In the result, it appears to me that we are free to follow Hambrook v. Stokes Bros. and I have already indicated my view that we should do so. I think that the existence of liability for shock negligently caused should be determined not by inquiring whether the shock resulted from fear for the personal safety of the claimant but rather by inquiring whether a reasonable person in the position of the defendant would have foreseen that his negligent act would probably result in shock injurious to the health of the claimant. I conclude, as did the learned trial judge, that the respondent did owe a duty to the appellant to take reasonable care not to inflict a mental shock on her by communicating the false item to her and that the first question listed above should accordingly be answered in favour of the appellant.\nThe second question presents little difficulty. I agree with O'Halloran J.A. and the learned trial judge that the respondent failed in its duty to take care. Inquiries occupying only a few minutes would have shewn that no such person as Mrs. R. C. Guay lived at the address stated in the item. The evidence of the respondent's witness quoted by O'Halloran J.A. seems to me to conclude this question against the respondent.\nThe third question would present no difficulty if it were not for the decision of the Judicial Committee in Victorian Railway Commissioners v. Coultas [14]. For the reasons given by O'Halloran J.A., in the case at bar, those given by Middleton J.A., speaking for the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Negro v. Pietros Bread [15], and those given by Hogg J., as he then was, in Austin v. Mascarin [16], I think that we are not bound to follow and ought not to follow the decision in the Coultas case. I would respectfully adopt as a correct statement of the law the following passage from the judgment of Lord Macmillan in Hay or Bourhill v. Young (supra) at page 103:\u2014\nIt is no longer necessary to consider whether the infliction of what is called mental shock may constitute an actionable wrong. The crude view that the law should take cognizance only of physical injury resulting from actual impact has been discarded, and it is now well recognized that an action will lie for injury by shock sustained through the medium of the eye or the ear without direct contact.\nIt follows from the above reasons that I think that the appeal should be allowed and it remains to consider the fourth question, whether the judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored simpliciter or whether the damages should be increased in accordance with the view of O'Halloran J.A. After an anxious consideration of all the evidence dealing with the question of damages, I have reached the conclusion that we ought not to interfere with the assessment made by the learned trial judge, who had the advantage, always great and in this case peculiarly so, of actually seeing and hearing the witnesses, and particularly the appellant herself.\nBefore parting with the matter I wish to mention the argument addressed to us that if the judgment of the learned trial judge is restored it will, in effect, amount to a decision that a newspaper must warrant the truth of everything it prints. In my view there is nothing in the judgment of the learned trial judge or in what I have said above which has any such effect. This decision does not touch the case of a reader of a newspaper who suffers financial loss through acting to his detriment on inaccurate information which he reads in the paper. The questions involved in such a case are not before us, as they would have been if, for example, the appellant had been induced by reading the item to fly to Timmins thereby incurring expense. In this regard I think it well to follow the example set by Lord Wright in Grant v. Australian Knitting Mills, Ld. (supra) where, faced with a somewhat similar argument, he said at page 107:\u2014\nIn their Lordships' opinion it is enough for them to decide this case on its actual facts. No doubt many difficult problems will arise before the precise limits of the principle are defined: many qualifying conditions and many complications of fact may in the future come before the Courts for decision. It is enough now to say that their Lordships hold the present case to come within the principle of Donoghue's case,\u2026\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge. The appellant should have her costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court, the respondent should have its costs of the cross-appeal in the Court of Appeal.\nKERWIN J.:\u2014In one issue of its daily newspaper printed in Vancouver, the respondent published a news item stating that the husband and three children of the appellant had been killed in an accident in Northern Ontario. This report was untrue. The information leading to the publication did not come from one of the recognized press services or from any of the respondent's reporters or correspondents but apparently from someone who must have known of the appellant and the whereabouts of her husband and children. The respondent was unable to say who that was or the manner in which the information was conveyed to it. The respondent was not actuated by malice and there was no contractual relationship between it and the appellant. Upon consideration of the evidence, I am satisfied that the trial judge rightly found that the respondent was negligent in publishing the item and therefore the question is whether it is liable in negligence for the shock and impairment in health suffered by the appellant as a result of her reading the report. There is no authority in this Court that compels us to decide either way but there is a considerable body of opinion leading to an answer in the negative.\nNegligence is a separate tort: Donoghue v. Stevenson [17]: Grant v. Australian Knitting Mills Ltd. [18]. Hay or Bourhill v. Young [19]. Several cases bearing upon the point to be determined in this appeal have been decided both before and after this proposition was firmly established, some of which will now be referred to. Derry v. Peek [20], was an action for damages for deceit, and the speeches of all the members of the House of Lords and the reasons for judgment in subsequent cases referring to that decision must be read with that fact in mind. In Shapiro v. La Morta [21], as stated by Lord Justice Banks at 626, the Court of Appeal proceeded upon the basis that:\u2014 \"It was not disputed that in order to succeed the plaintiff must prove that the publication by the defendants was maliicious.\" From this I take it that counsel had admitted that malice was necessary, and it is in the light of that circumstance that one must read the statement of Lord Atkin at page 628:\u2014 \"I think the plaintiff fails in consequence of being unable to prove that the damage was caused by a representation that was malicious.\"\nHowever, it had been laid down by the Common Pleas in Rawlins v. Bell [22] and by the Exchequer Chamber in Ormrod v. Huth [23], that an injury caused by a statement false in fact but not so to the knowledge of the party making it, or made without intent to deceive, will not support an action. In Playford v. United Kingdom Electric Telegraph Company Limited [24], the Queen's Bench decided that the defendant was not liable in damages for a mistake made by it in transmitting a telegram sent to the plaintiff by a third party, upon which the plaintiff acted to his detriment. This decision apparently proceeded upon the ground that there was no contract between the plaintiff and the defendant but in Dickson v. Reuter's Telegram Company, Limited [25], the Common Pleas Division held that the decision disposed of the case before it where the defendant had negligently delivered to the plaintiffs a message intended for a third person and the plaintiffs had suffered damages as a consequence of acting upon the telegram. Rawlins v. Bell and Ormrod v. Huth were referred to by Denman J., speaking on behalf of the Court. The judgment of the Common Pleas Division was affirmed by the Court of Appeal [26]. Lord Justice Bramwell stated that plaintiffs' counsel had admitted that the case prima facie fell within the general rule \"That no action is maintainable for a mere statement although untrue and although acted on to the damage of the person to whom it is made unless that statement is false to the knowledge of the person making it.\" After posing the question whether any duty arose by law he proceeded:\u2014 \"If it did arise by law, the consequence would be that the general rule which has been admitted to exist is inaccurate, and that it ought to be laid down in these terms, that no action will lie against a man for misrepresentation of facts whereby damage has been occasioned to another person, unless that misrepresentation is fraudulent or careless. But it is never laid down that the exemption from liability for an innocent misrepresentation is taken away by carelessness.\" Lord Justice Brett said that the general rule was that no erroneous statement is actionable unless it be intentionally false and that this seemed to be admitted by the plaintiffs' counsel. Lord Justice Cotton pointed out that it was admitted that misrepresentation alone would not have supported an action but that it was contended that owing to the nature of the business carried on by the defendants they were bound to warrant the accuracy of the message, or at least to guarantee that every precaution had been taken by their agents to avoid mistake. In Balden v. Shorter [27], Maugham J. decided that an action would not lay if a person by a false statement made negligently but in the belief that it was true led a third person to act to his damage. In Nocton v. Ashburton [28], the House of Lords decided that Derry v. Peek did not prevent an action succeeding where there was a fiduciary relationship between a mortgagee and a solicitor but, at page 948, Lord Haldane pointed out that \"liability for negligence in word has in material respect been developed in our law differently from liability for negligence in act.\" In truth there appear to be weighty reasons for differentiating between the liability in these two classes of cases. Defamatory statements, oral or written, were in very early times placed in a category by themselves and with the protection afforded by the law to those so affected there was a reluctance to hold liable in damages the publishers of incorrect non-defamatory statements made negligently but not maliciously. It is important to note that the same reluctance existed in the State of New York because the judgment of Cardoza J., speaking for the majority of the Court of Appeals, in the well-known case of MacPherson v. Buick [29], was approved by two of their Lordships in Donoghue v. Stevenson.\nThe Court of Appeals, speaking through the same judge who by then had become Chief Judge, also decided Glanzer v. Shepherd [30]. There a public weigher employed by a seller of beans by his negligence in weighing, or in reporting the weight, gave to the purchaser a certificate which erroneously overstated the amount delivered. A third party relying upon the certificate sustained damages for which the weigher was held liable upon the ground that the controlling circumstance was not the character of the consequences but its proximity or remoteness in the thought and purpose of the action, and that the copy of the weigh slip was sent to the plaintiff for the very purpose of inducing action. Subsequently, in Jaillet v. Cashman[31], the Court of Appeals, affirming the judgments below, held that a stock-ticker company was not liable where it had given wrong information as to the decision of a Court, as a result of which a speculator reading the tape in a broker's office was misled into dealing in shares the value of which was affected by the decision. No reasons were given but the trial Court had compared the ticker services to a newspaper, stating that practical expediency was more important than logic. Still later, in Ultra Mares v. Houche [32], Chief Judge Cardoza delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeals and, referring to Jaillet v. Cashman, stated that \"if liability had been upheld, the step would have been a short one to the declaration of a like liability on the part of proprietors of newspapers.\" In the case then before him, public accountants were held not liable for an inaccurate certificate as to a company's finances if made merely negligently and not fraudulently. The Chief Judge pointed out at page 185 that if, as was argued, the principle should be extended so as to cover such a case \"the extension, if made, will so expand the field of liability for negligent speech as to make it nearly, if not quite, co-terminus with that of liability for fraud.\" Such an expansion had already been negatived by Lord Justice Bramwell in the Dickson case.\nWe may now revert to the decision in Donoghue v. Stevenson, upon which the trial judge and the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal relied. While there are traces in some quarters of a distinction being drawn between damages for injuries to a person in body or mind or damages to a person's property on the one hand, and economic loss on the other, there would appear to be difficulty in ascertaining a sound basis for such a distinction. On the other hand there may be differences of substance between cases where a person of his own volition proceeds to act upon a negligent but non-fraudulent mis-statement, and where he does not so act but suffers damage as a direct result of the mis-statement. No opinion, therefore, is expressed as to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Candler v. Crane [33]. In any event it is unnecessary to explore these matters further because I am of opinion that in this case the appellant was not a \"neighbour\" of the respondent within the meaning of Lord Atkin's oft-quoted statement in Donoghue v. Stevenson since she was not a person so closely and directly affected by the publishing of the report that the respondent ought reasonably to have the appellant in contemplation as being affected injuriously when it was directing its mind to the act of publishing. This being so, there was no duty in law owed by the respondent to the appellant.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. ESTEY, J.:\u2014The respondent published, under date of February 3, 1948, in its newspaper the Vancouver Sun, the following:\nEX-VANCOUVER MAN, CHILDREN\nKILLED IN CRASH\nA former Vancouver man and his three children were killed in an automobile-train collision in Northern Ontario over the weekend, according to word received by relatives here.\nMrs. R. C. Guay, 1972 West Sixth, said today she and her husband had been notified that her husband's brother, Dick Guay, his daughter and two sons, are all dead.\nThe wife of the dead man is believed to be in Vancouver, Mrs. Guay said.\nMr. Guay left Vancouver last June and has been living in North Bay.\nThe accident occurred when he was motoring with the three children from Timmins to North Bay. The news of the tragedy was sent here by another brother who lives in Ontario.\nThis news item was, upon the evidence, probably delivered at the office of the respondent by some person whose identity has not been determined. It was a false statement, published as received, without in any way checking its contents.\nThe appellant read this item on the evening of its publication and was naturally deeply grieved and affected. She inquired at the address given and found that no Mrs. Guay resided there, nor could she obtain any information with respect to the contents of the news item. She later inquired by telephone of the respondent and received a very indifferent answer. A friend later telephoned with the same result, but no effort was made to inquire of the officers or employees in the more responsible positions. In the result, respondent officers did not learn of the misstatement until the appellant consulted a lawyer in the fall who, under date of November 5, 1948, wrote a letter advising that based upon \"negligent editing\" a claim for damages would be made. The investigation then made by the respondent could not ascertain precisely just how the statement had been received, more than that it was not from one of the recognized news services.\nThe appellant alleges that as a consequence of reading this news item she \"suffered shock resulting in an acute anxiety state.\" On her behalf it is submitted that such shock was a foreseeable consequence within the meaning of our law of negligence and, therefore, before publication the respondent owed a duty to her to exercise reasonable care to verify the truth thereof.\nCounsel for the appellant did not cite, nor have we found in our law, a decision directly in point. He submits, however, that if not before then since the decision of Donoghue v. Stevenson [34], respondent owed the duty already expressed to the appellant and, because she suffered shock resulting from a breach thereof, she should recover therefor.\nCounsel for the respondent submits that throughout the decided cases and recognized texts, both before and since the Donoghue decision, statements are found to the effect that recovery is not permitted for damage resulting from statements negligently made.\nIn Salmond on the Law of Torts, 10th Ed., 1945, at p. 580, the learned author, in discussing the law of deceit, states:\nMere negligence in the making of false statements is not actionable either as deceit or as any other kind of tort. This is the anomalous rule established by the House of Lords in the leading case of Derry v. Peek, (1889) 14 App. Cas. 337. Although in almost all other forms of human action a man is bound to take reasonable care not to do harm to others, this duty does not extend to the making of statements on which other persons are intended to act.\nIn Pollock on Torts, 11th Ed., 1951, at p. 430, the learned author, after discussing liability in tort arising out of a contract in favour of a contracting party against one not a party to the contract, goes on to discuss that under English law a telegraph company is not liable to the recipient of a telegram for damages caused by the negligent transmission of that message, while in the United States a telegraph company would be liable to such a recipient. After pointing out that the United States decisions \"are on principle correct,\" the learned author goes on to state at p. 430:\nGenerally speaking, there is no such thing as liability for negligence in word as distinguished from act and this difference is founded in the nature of the thing.\nIn Dickson v. Reuter's Telegram Company [35], cited by the learned author, Brett L.J., at p. 7, states:\nIf the case for the plaintiffs be simply that there was a misrepresentation upon which they have reasonably acted to their detriment, it must fail, owing to the general rule that no erroneous statement is actionable unless it be intentionally false. In a note at p. 429 of Pollock on Torts, 11th Ed., referring to the Dickson case, it is stated:\nIts authority would be impaired if Lord Atkin's wide principle in Donoghue v. Stevenson, 1932, A.C. 562, could be accepted, but it is submitted that it is still good law.\nBowen L.J. in Le Lievre v. Gould [36], referring to \"the suggestion that a man is responsible for what he states in a certificate to any person to whom he may have reason to suppose that the certificate may be shewn\", adds that\nThe law of England does not go to that extent: it does not consider that what a man writes on paper is like a gun or other dangerous instrument, and, unless he intended to deceive, the law does not, in the absence of contract, hold him responsible for drawing his certificate carelessly.\nThe foregoing quotations and others to similar effect are found in discussions of false statements intentionally made or statements which, when negligently made, have induced a person to pursue a course of action from which he suffered financial loss. They are, therefore, not made in relation to a discussion of an issue such as here raised.\nRespondent submitted that Candler v. Crane Christmas & Co [37], supported his contention. In the Candler case a firm of accountants was employed to prepare a statement of accounts and a balance sheet. Their clerk, in the course of his duty, negligently prepared the statement of accounts and a balance sheet which he knew would be used to induce the plaintiff to invest. The latter, relying thereon, did invest and suffered a loss. The accountants, however, were held not liable. The majority of the Lord Justices felt bound by Le Lievre v. Gould, supra, while Lord Denning, in a dissenting opinion, though since Donoghue v. Stevenson, supra, such precedents ought to be reviewed. Whatever the decision may be when such a case is reviewed by the House of Lords, it and similar cases have to do with negligent misstatements which induced a decision on the part of the plaintiff to pursue a course of conduct from which he suffered financial loss. There the essential factor is the inducement founded upon the misstatement, which is quite different from the present case where the contention is that the respondent suffered shock from a reading of the misstatement. While there does not appear to be any difference in principle between pecuniary and personal injury, historically greater emphasis has been placed upon the latter. What is important is the difference in the nature and character of negligent misstatements which cause someone to act to his detriment and those that normally and usually cause shock and consequent physical illness or other injury.\nIn the absence of binding authority the issue must be determined upon principle. At common law defamatory statements and malicious statements relative to title or goods and deceit are treated in a manner separate and distinct from acts or other conduct. On the other hand, a person who intentionally makes false statements is liable in damages for personal injuries which directly result therefrom. Wilkinson v. Downton [38]; Janvier v. Sweeney [39] ; Bielitzki v. Obadisk [40].\nThat facts similar to those here present have not been the subject of litigation in our own courts may be due to several factors. Newspapers gather and publish news in a manner that, having regard to the nature of their business, even if due care be used, errors and mistakes will occur. These errors and mistakes are so common that the natural impulse is, upon reading such an item, that it may not be true and to commence appropriate inquiry. Moreover, the question of liability for physical injuries consequent upon shock has been of comparatively recent origin and the law in relation thereto does not appear to be settled. Victorian Railways Commissioners v. Coultas [41]; Dulieu v. White & Sons [42]; Hambrook v. Stokes Bros. [43]; Owens v. Liverpool Corporation [44]; Bourhill (Hay) v. Young [45]. Whatever the reason may be, no similar case has been found in the reports in our own country or in Great Britain and counsel cited only two in the United States.\nIn the United States the plaintiff in both cases was denied recovery. Herrick v. Evening Express Pub. Co., [46] is a decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of the State of Maine. The Portland Evening Express Advertiser negligently published, under the heading \"Boy Dies Across,\" a picture of the plaintiff's son and a report of his death. In fact the plaintiff's son was not dead. Recovery was denied on the basis that damages for mental suffering, apart from physical impact, could not be recovered.\nCurry et ux. v. Journal Pub. Co. et al [47], is a case almost identical in its facts. The proprietors of the Albuquerque Journal, a daily newspaper in New Mexico, negligently published that \"George Curry, 70, former territorial governor of New Mexico,\u2026 died here Sunday afternoon.\" In fact he had not died. This news item was read by his son Clifford Curry and the latter's wife and as a consequence both suffered mental and physical injury. The court stated two questions, first \"Are damages that result from words negligently spoken or written, as distinguished from acts, actionable?\" and second \"Can damages be recovered from the publishers of a newspaper for the consequences of grief resulting in physical injury, occasioned by reading in such paper a negligently published false report of the death of the reader's parent?\" Both British and United States authorities were considered and the decision was undoubtedly influenced by cases similar in character to the Candler case, supra, and particularly the decision of Jaillet v. Cashman [48] (affirmed in the Appellate Division [49], and in the Court of Appeals [50]). There the defendant supplied to its subscribers items of current news by what is known as a ticker service. The plaintiff read from this ticker service an incorrect report of a decision of the United States Supreme Court dealing with the matter of taxation. As a consequence the plaintiff sold his stock and suffered a loss which he could not recover from the operator of the ticker service. In the course of the reasons for judgment it was stated at p. 173:\nNo attempt has been made by any American court\u2026, nor will be by us, to state rules which will apply generally to all conditions or circumstances, which will authorize a recovery for damages resulting from false words negligently written or spoken, and in the absence of contract, malice, intentional injury, or other like circumstance. We hold that in some such cases recovery may be had, but we will confine our decision to the facts of this particular case. The Court found more than one basis upon which to deny liability, one of which was expressed at p. 174 as follows:\nIn this world of disease and death the families of aged persons, while never entirely prepared, yet may not be greatly surprised to hear of their death at any time; and such serious consequences to the plaintiffs, and particularly to Mrs. Curry (a daughter-in-law of Governor Curry), are so unusual and unlikely to happen under any circumstances, and certainly not to persons in good health (and nothing appears to the contrary), that it cannot be said there was an appreciable chance of such results; and defendants, as reasonable men, could not have realized that there was an appreciable risk to the health of plaintiffs from reading the article, though they had known of plaintiffs' existence, which does not appear.\nThe Court, it would appear, in the foregoing is directing its mind to the issue of the existence of a duty rather than to that of remoteness of damage.\nLord Wright, in Bourhill (Hay) v. Young [51], after pointing out that damage by mental shock may give a cause of action, went on to state at p. 106:\nWhere there is no immediate physical action by the defendant on the plaintiff, but the action operates at a distance, or is not direct, or is what is called nervous shock, difficulties arise in ascertaining if there has been a breach of duty.\nThe difficulty here envisaged is emphasized by a consideration of Dulieu v. White & Sons [52], where Kennedy J. was of the opinion that the shock, in order to provide a basis for liability, must arise from \"a reasonable fear of immediate personal injury to oneself,\" which the Court of Appeal refused to follow in Hambrook v. Stokes Bros. [53]. This conflict of opinion, though considered, was not resolved in Bourhill (Hay) v. Young, supra.\nIn view of the more recent development of the law of torts and the present state of authorities, I am not prepared to say that there can never be recovery for physical illness or other injury caused by shock consequent upon negligent misstatements. Whether in a particular case such as the present a duty to exercise due care exists because injury, as a normal and ordinary consequence, would be foreseeable to a reasonable person, always presents an important and difficult question. While rather disposed to the conclusion upon the authorities already mentioned and, in particular, the remarks in Bourhill (Hay) v. Young, supra, and those of Professor Goodhart in Modern Law Review, Vol. 16 at p. 25, that in the particular facts of this case a duty does not rest upon the respondent, it is unnecessary to decide that issue. Even if it be assumed that such a duty rested upon the respondent, which I do not decide, it is an essential part of the appellant's case that damages be established. J.R. Munday Limited v. London County Council [54]; Pollock on Torts, 15th Ed., p. 139; Winfield Law of Torts 5th Ed., p. 19.\nNo question as to the sufficiency of the proof of damage appears to have been raised before the learned trial judge. The evidence discloses that at the time of reading the article the appellant was emotionally upset, but it does not disclose illness or absence from work at that time. While this is not conclusive, it is, in the circumstances of this case, significant. The appellant had purchased a restaurant in 1946 and had sold it in December, 1947, when she took a trip east and visited her children. She returned to Vancouver in January, 1948, and went to work at Pratts Secret Service with whom she was employed as an investigator \"checking on the employees\" of another employer. At the time of reading the item here in question she was so employed and states that a few weeks later she was asked to resign, as her work was not satisfactory. In the following May, 1948, she took back the restaurant and again sold it in May, 1949. Thereafter she accepted a position at Eaton's which she retained until January, 1950, when she was laid off because \"they were over-staffed.\" She went back to work for Eaton's in the spring of 1950 and at the time of the action was employed with the B.C. Electric. No person was called who had been associated with her either in business or socially who deposed to any illness or change of conduct on her part. She herself stated:\nI would not say that I am sick or anything, but any time any little things upset me so badly. When I balance the cash, if there is a few cents short, I will be nights without sleep. Everything upsets me. Otherwise, physically, I am O.K.\nThe medical evidence is far from conclusive. Although the article appeared on February 3, a doctor was not consulted until October. He deposed that there was no physical disability other than the fact that she was suffering from an anxiety as exemplified by symptoms of pulse and moist or cold palms and soles. He did express his opinion, based upon her history as she gave it to him and his own examination, that her condition was directly related to the reading of the news item here in question. He, however, went on to depose that the fact that she had been living apart from her husband and children, with the attendant uncertainty and insecurity, would cause her condition of anxiety such as he found it. Another doctor agreed that her condition might be the result of her separation from husband and family and, in referring particularly to emotional disturbances, stated:\nI think, in medical experience and psychological experience as it usually occurs it is an examination of various factors, and it is difficult to single out one factor and say, \"That is the factor\".\nIn Wilkinson v. Downton, supra, where, because of the intentionally made false statement, the plaintiff suffered shock causing physical illness and other injury, the remarks of Wright J. at p. 58 are relevant to this issue:\nThese consequences were not in any way the result of previous illhealth or weakness of constitution; nor was there any evidence of predisposition to nervous shock or any other idiosyncrasy.\nMoreover, it is important to keep in mind what must be proved in order that damages may be recovered, as stated in Pollock on Torts, 15th Ed. at p. 37, as follows:\nA state of mind such as fear or acute grief is not in itself capable of assessment as measurable temporal damage. But visible and provable illness may be the natural consequence of violent emotion, and may furnish a ground of action against a person whose wrongful act or want of due care produced that emotion\u2026. In every case the question is whether the shock and the illness were in fact natural or direct consequences of the wrongful act or default; if they were, the illness, not the shock, furnishes the measurable damage, and there is no more difficulty in assessing it than in assessing damages for bodily injuries of any kind.\nIn my opinion the evidence does not establish that the appellant suffered physical illness or other injury consequent upon shock or emotional disturbance caused by a reading of the item in question.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nLOCKE, J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [55] which allowed the appeal of the present respondent from a judgment for damages awarded against it at the trial by Wood, J. O'Halloran, J.A. dissented and would have dismissed the appeal and increased the amount of damages awarded. The question to be determined is one of general importance. The respondent company publishes a daily newspaper called the Vancouver Sun having a large circulation in Vancouver and throughout the Province of British Columbia. On February 3, 1948, there appeared in the newspaper the following article:\u2014\nEx-Vancouver man, Children\nKilled in Crash\nA former Vancouver man and his three children were killed in an automobile-train collision in Northern Ontario over the weekend, according to word received by relatives here.\nMrs. R. C. Guay, 1972 West Sixth, said today she and her husband had been notified that her husband's brother, Dick Guay, his daughter and two sons, are all dead.\nThe wife of the dead man is believed to be in Vancouver, Mrs. Guay said.\nMr. Guay left Vancouver last June and has been living in North Bay.\nThe accident occurred when he was motoring with the three children from Timmins to North Bay. The news of the tragedy was sent here by another brother who lives in Ontario.\nNo such accident had taken place. There was no such person as Mrs. R. C. Guay living at the address given and there is no evidence that anyone of that name had made any such statement as was attributed to her by the article.\nThe appellant, the wife of the man referred to as \"Dick\" Guay and the mother of the three children, by her statement of claim alleged that the publication of the article was negligent on the part of the respondent and that, as a result of such publication she was caused to believe that her husband and children had been killed and, in consequence, suffered shock which resulted in an acute state of anxiety, as a consequence of which she had been unable to carry on her customary occupation and would, for an indefinite time, be partially disabled. She further claimed that she had for a period of approximately three weeks been unable to discover the truth and, believing during such period that her children and husband were dead, had suffered intense mental anguish which affected her mental and physical well-being. Malice on the part of the respondent was not pleaded.\nWhile the question to be determined is a matter of law, it is, I think, of some importance to consider the facts in this particular case, in order to appreciate the extent of the liability of newspapers contended for by the appellant. The appellant lives in Vancouver and, at the time of the publication of the article in question, was living apart from her husband, in accordance with the terms of an agreement of separation made between them on February 4, 1947. Three children had been born of her marriage to Ulderic Guay and by the terms of the agreement the husband undertook the custody of the children and their maintenance and support and it was agreed that he should be at liberty to remove them to the Town of Val Gagni, Ont., where his brother and sister resided and where suitable schooling and maintenance might be afforded to the children. The parties agreed thereafter to live separate and apart, the wife to be free of any control or authority of the husband and surrendering all claims upon him for support or maintenance. The agreement contained further provisions that the wife should have the right of access to the children at all reasonable times. In accordance with this agreement, Guay had removed the children to Timmins, Ont. during the summer of 1947 and the appellant had spent Christmas and New Year's with them at that place, returning to Vancouver on January 7, 1948. It was on February 2 of that year that she saw the article in question.\nWhile it might have been expected that the appellant reading of the death of all the members of her family would have either telephoned immediately to the persons in Timmins with whom her children resided to obtain further information and to learn where and when they were to be buried, or obtained this information by telegraph, she did none of these things. According to her, she had some friends telephone to the Sun newspaper but they could not get any \"satisfactory explanation\" and accordingly she wrote to her husband's relatives in Ontario but got no answer. She also wrote to her mother who, in turn, wrote to her eldest brother in Quebec to investigate whether the article had appeared in the Eastern papers. The brother apparently wired the Chief of Police in Timmins who informed him that there never had been such an accident. He then wired this information to his mother who lived in Saskatchewan, who, in turn, forwarded the telegram to Mrs. Guay at Vancouver. According to the appellant, she received this wire which had been sent to her brother from Timmins on February 19 around the beginning of March. She had, however, some three or four weeks after February 2 received a letter from one of the children, which was the first intimation she had that the article had been untrue.\nAt the time of the publication the appellant was employed as a store detective by a commercial firm in Vancouver and while she continued in that employment for a few weeks she was so upset by the news that she was unable to carry on her duties and was asked by her employer to resign. She first consulted a doctor on October 27, 1948. According to her, she had been nervous and upset since reading the article but, as she thought there was nothing wrong with her physically, she had not thought that there was any point in seeing a physician. Doctor Kaplan, whom she first consulted, had examined her and found that her pulse rate was high, that she had an increased blood pressure and suffering from sweating of the palms with cold extremities, these symptoms indicating to him that she was suffering anxiety. Doctor Kaplan had experience in psychiatric work and after hearing Mrs. Guay's story prescribed concentrated therapy. In his opinion, her condition was directly related to the incident in question.\nWhile Mrs. Guay had telephoned to the newspaper office a few days after the publication, the person to whom she spoke and whose identity does not appear told her that the reporter who had turned in the article was out and was unable to give her any information. The employer of her sister, at the latter's instance, also telephoned to the respondent's office and spoke to someone who, he thought, was a person at the news desk who could not tell him the source of the information upon which the article was based. It was not until November 5, 1948, more than nine months after the time of publication, that the solicitors wrote the publishing company to say that the appellant claimed damages for negligence, by reason of the publication. In the letter it was said that, as a result of what was described as \"a series of fortuitous circumstances\" Mrs. Guay had been unable to discover the erroneous nature of the report for some weeks.\nAccording to Mr. Charles F. Bailey, the business manager of the respondent company, the first intimation that had been received by the respondent that the article published had been incorrect was this letter from the solicitors. After receiving the letter, endeavours had been made to locate the R. C. Guay referred to in the article but no one of that name lived at 1972 West 6th Avenue in Vancouver and they were unable to find any such person. Inquiries were also made among the employees of the publishing company but none of those in its employ at that time knew anything about the matter and the respondent had been unable to ascertain by whom the report had been turned in to the office. According to Mr. Bailey, an average of from 800 to 1,000 despatches or news reports of various kinds are received daily and, of these, less than half are published. News despatches are received from the Canadian Press and the British United Press but the article in question had not been transmitted by either of these organizations. Asked as to the manner in which other news received by the paper was handled, he said that stories brought in by their own trained reporters were not checked, except for further background material and that:\u2014\nSimilarly where news reports that come from our country correspondents, unless there should be something in the nature of the story that would indicate that further enquiries should be made before it was published. It would not normally be checked; other than for elaboration. Unsolicited stories, particularly those that would come in by telephone, we or any other newspaper would normally be wary of and more careful. Those presented in person would have to be checked, largely on their merits, by the decision of the editor handling the story.\nHe said further that it was in the discretion of the editor handling the matter as to what check there should be made. Whether the story in question had been received by the newspaper in writing or by telephone and reduced to writing in the office, does not appear. Owing to the volume of material that came in to the office of such a newspaper every day, it is found impossible, according to this witness, to keep it on file for any protracted length of time. The delay in disputing the accuracy of the report had thus prevented the respondent from making any effective efforts to find out the source of its information for the article in question.\nThe respondent had been unable to find anyone in its employ in November 1948 who had been in its employ in February 1948 who knew the appellant or her husband or any of her family. It is, I think, apparent, however, from the terms of the article that the information had been given to the respondent by some one who knew something about the family of the appellant (which consisted of a daughter and two sons as stated) and it being the fact that Guay had left Vancouver the previous June and had been living in North Bay or in that vicinity. Whether the informant had heard a false report of such an accident or acted maliciously in giving the information to the newspaper cannot be determined. The good faith of the respondent, however, is not questioned.\nWood, J. by whom the action was tried, considered that the judgment of Lord Atkin in Donoghue v. Stevenson [56], stated the principle which should be applied. The passage in the judgment relied upon reads:\u2014\nThe liability for negligence, whether you style it such or treat it as in other systems as a species of 'culpa', is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay. But acts or omissions which any moral code would censure cannot in a practical world be treated so as to give a right to every person injured by them to demand relief. In this way rules of law arise which limit the range of complainants and the extent of their remedy. The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer's question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law is my neighbour? The answer seems to be\u2014persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question.\nThe learned trial Judge found on the evidence that the respondent had been negligent in publishing the article. He then said:\u2014\nI take the view that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff and that as a result of its failure to observe that duty the plaintiff suffered.\nThe exact nature of the duty is not stated but I think it to be clear that it was to refrain from publishing a news item of this nature, without first making reasonable efforts to ascertain that the facts were as stated.\nIn the Court of Appeal[57], Sidney Smith, J.A., with whom Robertson, J.A. agreed, was of the opinion that nothing decided in Donoghue v. Stevenson touched the question in the present matter. I respectfully concur in that opinion. The learned Justice of Appeal considered that the matter was to be determined upon the principle which had been applied in Shapiro v. La Morta [58] and Balden v. Shorter [59]. O'Halloran, J.A. agreed with Wood, J. and in concluding his judgment said in part:\u2014\nOnce the Donoghue concept of the tort of negligence is accepted, then whether appellant owed a duty vis-a-vis the respondent not to harm her by negligent publication of a false news item of the kind in this case, is a question of fact.\nand said that this fact had been found in favour of the present appellant by the trial Judge who had neither misapprehended the evidence or misconceived its weight. He further expressed the opinion that the general damages allowed had been inadequate and would have allowed the appeal and increased the amount to $3,000.\nIn my opinion, there was evidence from which the learned trial Judge might draw the inference that the defendant had acted negligently in publishing the article without first making an effort to ascertain its accuracy. There may have been some explanation regarding this aspect of the matter which might have been made, had the appellant made her claim promptly instead of waiting for a period of over nine months. Since, however, the respondent was unable to give any evidence at all as to the source of its information and as an enquiry by telephone or otherwise would have immediately disclosed the fact that there was no such person as Mrs. R. C. Guay living at 1972 West 6th Avenue and no one of that name known there, the finding at the trial that this was negligent conduct should not, in my opinion, be disturbed. The question to be determined in this appeal is as to whether, assuming that the appellant suffered injury in consequence of the publication, she has a right of action against the respondent.\nIt is well at the outset in a matter of such importance to consider the extent of the liability which, it is asserted, exists. It is neither suggested in the pleadings or the argument that the respondent acted maliciously or with any intent to injure the appellant, or that the statement was published recklessly without caring whether it was true or false, upon proof of which malice might be inferred. The case is to be decided upon the footing that the respondent acted honestly and in good faith. The appellant's contention, put bluntly, amounts to this that newspapers owe a duty to all those who may read their publications to exercise reasonable diligence to see that any items they publish are true, and are accordingly liable for a negligent misstatement should damage result from its publication.\nThe statement complained of was a misrepresentation. A misrepresentation may be either innocent or fraudulent. If innocent, it may be a ground for rescission of a transaction or a good defence to an action for specific performance but, subject to the certain exceptions to be noted, it gives no right of action sounding in damages (Heilbut v. Buckleton) [60]. In Taylor v. Ashton [61], an action was brought against directors of a bank for fraudulent misrepresentations as to its affairs. The jury found the defendants not guilty of fraud but expressed the opinion that they had been guilty of gross negligence. Baron Parke, who delivered the judgment of the Court, said as to this (p. 415):\u2014\nIt is insisted that even that (that is, the gross negligence) accompanied with a damage to the plaintiff in consequence of that gross negligence, would be sufficient to give him a right of action. From this proposition we entirely dissent; because we are of opinion that, independently of any contract between the parties, no one can be made responsible for a representation of this kind, unless it be fraudulently made.\nIn Dickson v. Reuter's Telegram Company [62], where the defendant, through the negligence of its servant, had delivered to the plaintiffs a message not intended for them and they, reasonably supposing that it came from their agents and was intended for them, acted upon it and thereby incurred a loss, Bramwell, L.J. said that the general rule of law is clear that no action is maintainable for a mere statement, although untrue, and although acted on to the damage of the person to whom it is made, unless that statement is false to the knowledge of the person making it. Brett, L.J. said (p. 7) that if the case for the plaintiffs was simply that there was a misrepresentation upon which they have reasonably acted to their detriment, it must fail, owing to the general rule that no erroneous statement is actionable unless it be intentionally false.\nThe decision in Derry v. Peek [63], must be considered together with Nocton v. Ashburton [64]. Derry v. Peek was an action for damages for deceit, but certain statements made in the course of the judgments bear upon the matter to be considered here. When that case was heard in the Court of Appeal (Peek v. Derry [65]), Cotton, Hannen and Lopes, L.JJ. had all expressed the view that if a false statement is made without reasonable ground for believing it to be true an action for deceit would lie and considered that, though fraud was not proven, the directors who made the statements were liable on this footing. The judgment of the Court of Appeal was reversed in the House of Lords. All of the law Lords disagreed with this view. Lord Herschell pointed out the essential difference between making a statement careless whether it be true or false and, therefore, without any real belief in its truth, and making a false statement through want of care which is nevertheless honestly believed to be true. For the latter class of statement there was no liability for deceit. Cotton, L.J. had said that when a man makes an untrue statement with an intention that it shall be acted upon without any reasonable ground for believing that statement to be true, he makes default in a duty which was thrown upon him from the position he has taken upon himself and he violates the right which those to whom he makes the statement have to have true statements only made to them. Referring to this, Lord Herschell said (p. 362):\u2014\nNow I have first to remark on these observations that the alleged 'right' must surely be here stated too widely, if it is intended to refer to a legal right, the violation of which may give rise to an action for damages. For if there be a right to have true statements only made, this will render liable to an action those who make untrue statements, however innocently. This cannot have been meant.\nAfter a review of the authorities he said further (p. 375):\nBut that such an action (i.e. for deceit) could be maintained notwithstanding an honest belief that the statement made was true, if there were no reasonable grounds for the belief, was, I think, for the first time decided in the case now under appeal.\nThe directors of the railway company who had issued a prospectus containing a statement which they believed to be true, but which was in fact untrue, were relieved from the liability imposed upon them by the judgment of the Court of Appeal. In Angus v. Clifford [66], decided by the Court of Appeal on an appeal from Romer, J. the effect of the decision in Derry v. Peek was considered. The head note which accurately expresses the result of the case reads:\u2014\nIf a person who makes a false statement entertains a bona fide belief that the statement is true, an action of deceit cannot be maintained against him on the ground that he formed his belief carelessly or on insufficient reasons. If he had formed no belief whether the statement was true or false, and made it recklessly without caring whether it was true or false, an action of deceit will lie against him. But not so if he carelessly made the statement without appreciating the importance and significance of the words used, unless indifference to their truth is proved.\nThe action was brought by the shareholder of a mining company for damages alleged to have been sustained by his having been induced to take shares in the company by untrue statements contained in the prospectus. The judgment of Romer, J. does not make quite clear the ground upon which he proceeded in holding the directors liable and he did not refer either to Peek v. Derry which had already been decided in the Court of Appeal or to Derry v. Peek. He found, however, that the statements were untrue, that they were material, and that the plaintiff had relied upon them and said that he thought it was clear that no proper care was taken by the defendants with reference to them. He did not find fraud. The decision was reversed in the Court of Appeal. Lindley, L.J., referring to the judgment of the learned trial Judge and after mentioning the fact that he had not found that the directors were guilty of fraud, said in part (p. 463):\u2014\nThen he comes to the conclusion that that statement, being untrue, was material; and then he rather appears to have proceeded upon the theory, that that alone would be enough, without addressing his mind to the further question whether these gentlemen would be liable, supposing that they did make this untrue statement, but made it carelessly, as distinguished from fraudulently. His judgment, when we read it carefully, shews upon the face of it, I think, that his mind was not addressed to that particular point, which was the point mainly argued before us. The judgment, so far as I read it, seems to me quite consistent with his having proceeded upon the view that Peek v. Derry, 37 Ch.D. 541, as decided in this Court, was law, whereas it was reversed by the House of Lords, as we all know.\nHe said further, referring to the case by its title in the Court of Appeal (pp. 463-4):\u2014\nSpeaking of Peek v. Derry broadly, I take it that it has settled once for all the controversy which was well known to have given rise to very considerable difference of opinion as to whether an action for negligent misrepresentation, as distinguished from fraudulent misrepresentation, could be maintained. There was considerable authority to the effect that it could, and there was considerable authority to the effect that it could not; and as I understand Peek v. Derry (14 A.C. 337), it settles that question in this way\u2014that an action for a negligent, as distinguished from a fraudulent, misrepresentation in a company's prospectus cannot be supported; I think it is perfectly impossible to read the judgments which were delivered in that case, especially Lord Herschell's to which I will allude presently, without seeing that that is the broad proposition of law which Peek v Derry has settled, and settled for good.\nAfter considering in detail what had been said by Lord Herschell, Lindley, L.J. concluded (p. 466):\u2014\nIf it is fraud, it is actionable, if it is not fraud, but merely carelessness\u2014it is not.\nUpon the evidence he found that there was no moral obliquity in what the directors had done, that it was what he described as \"pure blundering, pure carelessness\", and that being the case the action could not be maintained. Bowen, L.J. said that after reading the evidence he did not feel satisfied that there was any dishonesty at all, though he thought there was very gross and culpable carelessness in the use of their language.\nIn Le Lievre v. Gould [67], mortgagees of the interest of a builder under a building agreement advanced money to him from time to time on the faith of certificates given by a surveyor that certain specified stages in the progress of the buildings had been reached. The surveyor was not appointed by the mortgagees, and there was no contractual relation between him and them. In consequence of the negligence of the surveyor, the certificates contained untrue statements as to the progress of the buildings but there was no fraud on his part. Lord Esher, M.R. who had written one of the judgments in Heaven v. Pender [68], considered that the later case had no application and that it had been established by Derry v. Peek that in the absence of contract an action for negligence cannot be maintained where there is no fraud. This statement must be taken to be qualified by what was later decided in Nocton v. Ashburton. Bowen, L.J. said in part (p. 501):\u2014\nNegligent misrepresentation does not amount to deceit, and negligent misrepresentation can give rise to a cause of action only if a duty lies upon the defendant not to be negligent, and in that class of cases of which Derry v. Peek was one, the House of Lords considered that the circumstances raised no such duty. After referring to Heaven v. Pender and cases of that class and to the liability of owners of certain chattels and of dangerous premises, Bowen, L.J. asked himself if they had any application to cases such as the one under consideration and said as to this (p. 502):\u2014\nOnly, I suppose, on the suggestion that a man is responsible for what he states in a certificate to any person to whom he may have reason to suppose that the certificate may be shewn. But the law of England does not go to that extent: it does not consider that what a man writes on paper is like a gun or other dangerous instrument, and, unless he intended to deceive, the law does not, in the absence of contract, hold him responsible for drawing his certificate carelessly.\nA. L. Smith, L.J., who agreed in dismissing the appeal, was also of the opinion that the principle of Heaven v. Pender had no application to the case.\nNocton v. Ashburton [69], was an action brought against a solicitor claiming damages on the footing that the defendant had improperly and in bad faith advised Ashburton to realease from a mortgage held by him a valuable part of the security, knowing that it would thereby be rendered insufficient, and of having represented untruly that the remaining security would be sufficient. Derry v. Peek was considered at length in the judgments delivered.\nThe trial Judge, Neville, J. had found that the charge of fraud was not proved and dismissed the action. The Court of Appeal had reversed the finding and granted relief on the ground that there had been fraud. It was decided in the House of Lords that upon the evidence the Court of Appeal was not justified in reversing the finding of fact of the trial Judge but that the plaintiff was not precluded by the form of his pleadings from claiming relief on the footing of a breach of a duty arising from the existence of a fiduciary relationship and was entitled to succeed on that ground. The summary of the judgment of Viscount Haldane, L.C., contained in the head note of the report, sufficiently states the effect of the judgments of the Lord Chancellor and of Lord Dunedin and Lord Shaw of Dumferline, a majority of the members of the Court. It reads as follows (p.932):\u2014\nPer Viscount Haldane L.C.: Derry v. Peek (1889) 14 App. Cas. 337, which establishes that proof of a fraudulent intention is necessary to sustain an action of deceit, whether the claim is dealt with by a Court of Law or by a Court of Equity in the exercise of its concurrent jurisdiction, does not narrow the scope of the remedy in actions within the exclusive jurisdiction of a Court of Equity, which, though classed under the head of fraud, do not necessarily involve the existence of a fraudulent intention, as, for example, an action for indemnity for loss arising from a misrepresentation made in breach of a special duty imposed by the Court by reason of the relationship of the parties.\nUnless innocent misrepresentations made in the course of the negotiations leading up to the formation of a contract or in company prospectuses (before the latter matter was dealt with by statute) are to be distinguished from innocent misstatements of fact made in a newspaper or by an individual orally or in writing, this was the state of the law, as it affects the matter in question here, in 1932 when Donoghue v. Stevenson was decided. In that well-known case a shop assistant sought to recover damages from a manufacturer of aerated waters for injuries suffered as a result of consuming part of the contents of a bottle of ginger beer which contained the decomposed remains of a snail. The ginger beer had been purchased in a cafe in Paisley and not from the manufacturer. It was contained in a sealed glass container which would not in the ordinary course of events be opened until required for consumption. The exact point to be determined, and indeed the only point, was as to whether under these circumstances the manufacturer owed a duty to the ultimate consumer to take reasonable care that the contents of the bottle were fit for human consumption.\nThe present action is one of many, however, which have been undertaken on the footing that much more than this was decided in the judgment of Lord Atkin in the passage to which reference was made by the learned trial Judge. In Grant v. Australian Knitting Mills Ltd. [70], the Judicial Committee considered Donoghue's case and, after saying that they would follow it and that the only question which they were concerned with was what the case decided, said (p. 102):\u2014\nTheir Lordships think that the principle of the decision is summed up in the words of Lord Atkin:\u2014\nA manufacturer of products, which he sells in such a form as to show that he intends them to reach the ultimate consumer in the form in which they left him with no reasonable possibility of intermediate examination, and with the knowledge that the absence of reasonable care in the preparation or putting up of the products will result in an injury to the consumer's life or property, owes a duty to the consumer to take that reasonable care. Shapiro v. La Morta [71], referred to in the reasons for judgment of Sidney Smith, J.A. was decided prior to Donoghue's case. The action was brought by a professional pianist against the proprietors of a music hall who had erroneously published a report that she would appear at their hall during a certain week. In consequence, she lost another engagement and brought an action for injurious falsehood. Lush, J. held that as the statement was published bona fide the plaintiff could not recover and this was sustained by the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal consisting of Bankes, Scrutton and Atkin, L.JJ. The latter, it will be noted, agreed with Scrutton, L.J. that the statement was not actionable in the absence of malice.\nIn Balden v. Shorter [72], an action for injurious falsehood, Maugham, J. dismissed the action, holding that malice had not been shown and that the words were at the worst made without any indirect motive or any intention of injuring the plaintiff and in the belief that they were true. While this case was decided after the decision in Donoghue v. Stevenson, that case was not referred to either in the argument of counsel nor in the judgment.\nIn Old Gate Estates v. Toplis [73], a case referred to by the learned trial Judge and, I think, applied by him to a limited extent, the action was brought against a firm of valuators for negligence in making their valuation of certain real property. The valuation had been made at the request of the promoters of the plaintiff company but it was contended that the defendants knew that it was to be used for the purpose of the company and, therefore, owed a duty to the company to take proper care in making the valuation. Wrottesley, J., after referring to the passage from the judgment in Donoghue v. Stevenson, referred to by the learned trial Judge in the present matter, held the principle there stated to be inapplicable, it being confined to negligence which resulted in danger to life, limb or health, while the claim by Old Gate Estate Limited was for pecuniary loss. With respect, I think the true ground for distinguishing Donoghue's case was not that stated but rather that Le Lievre v. Gould, above referred to, was still the law and was decisive of the issue. I do not think the question as to whether a duty exists is to be decided by the nature of the injury claimed to have been sustained. The only other reported decision in England to which, I think, reference may usefully be made is Candler v. Crane [74], where in an action brought against a firm of accountants for negligence in preparing a financial report it was again attempted to apply the language of Lord Atkin in Donoghue's case to a case of negligent misstatement. Cohen and Asquith, L.JJ. following Derry v. Peek and Le Lievre v. Gould, were of the opinion that the action had been properly dismissed by the trial Judge, the false statements having been made carelessly but not fraudulently, and were not actionable in the absence of any contractual or fiduciary relationship between the parties and that this principle had in no way been qualified by the decision of the majority in Donoghue v. Stevenson. Denning, L.J. dissented.\nSammond on Torts, 10th Ed. 580, states the result of the decision in Derry v. Peek as being that a false statement is not actionable as a tort unless it is wilfully false and that mere negligence in the making of false statements is not actionable either as deceit or as any other kind of tort. The exceptions to the rule are then stated as being where there is a contractual duty, a fiduciary relationship as in Nocton v. Ashburton, and cases of warranty of authority and certain cases where the rule as to estoppel by representation may operate. It cannot be and is not suggested that the present case falls within any of these exceptions.\nIn the October 1951 issue of the Modern Law Review there is an article by Lord Wright regarding Re Polemis [75], in which, after referring to the difficulty which sometimes arises in distinguishing cases of remoteness of damage from cases of absence of duty, he says in part (14 Mod. L.R. 401):\u2014\nI may here note without developing or discussing or criticising the particular rules which by way of contrast have been applied in the case of negligent misstatements. I think Lord Atkin must have intended to recognize the distinction when in Donoghue v. Stevenson, at pp. 581 and 582, Le Lievre v. Gould was cited in his judgment. Furthermore he could not have intended to lay down a different rule from that stated in Nocton v. Ashburton as defining the extent of duty in regard to negligent misstatements. Negligence in words is distinguished there from negligence in acts. The former, it is there said, involves no breach of duty in the absence of fraud, contract or fiduciary relationship. Recently in the Court of Appeal in Candler v. Crane, Christmas & Co., Asquith, L.J., as he then was, and Cohen L.J. have held (Denning L.J. dissenting) that Le Lievre v. Gould is not qualified by Donoghue's Case and so at the moment the law is fixed. Asquith L.J. observes that Donoghue's Case has never been applied to injury other than physical, by which I apprehend he means to include also material injury. Without being dogmatic this seems to be generally true on the authorities. Perhaps it is more accurate to say that Donoghue's Case has never so far been applied to negligence in words. There may well be a substantial practical reason of a general character for that, as is suggested by Cohen L.J. in a long quotation from the language of Cardozo C.J. in Ultramares Corporation v. Touche (1931) 255 N.Y. Rep. 170. I think that in English law the general duty for purposes of the law of tort should as the law stands be limited so as not to include mere negligence in words and the first part of the rule in Re Polemis should be limited accordingly or at least only applied if it is applied with a difference.\nDonoghue v. Stevenson has been referred to in some of the judgments in this Court in Dozois v. Pure Spring Co. Ltd. [76]: Marleau v. People's Gas Supply Co. [77]: Attorney-General v. Jackson [78]: The King v. Anthony [79] and Booth v. St. Catharines [80], but in none of these cases was there any question as to its application to cases such as the present.\nWe have been referred to the decision of Wright J. in Wilkinson v. Downton [81], which, it is suggested, touches in some manner on the point to be decided here. There a defendant who had falsely represented to the plaintiff that her husband had met with a serious accident, knowing the statement to be untrue and intending that it should be believed, was held liable. The basis upon which liability was found was that the defendant had wilfully done an act calculated to cause physical harm to the plaintiff and had in fact cause such harm to her. In the present matter it is common ground that the defendant published the article in good faith, believing it to be true, and without malice. The matters considered in Janvier v. Sweeney [82], appear to me to be equally remote from the question arising in the present action.\nIf the principle which has been applied in the leading cases to which I have referred, where damage has been occasioned by acting upon the faith of a misstatement innocently made, is applicable to a claim where the damage is nervous shock or some other physical injury resulting from merely reading or hearing the statement, the matter is concluded by authority. It is, however, urged on behalf of the present appellant that since the injury in respect of which damages are claimed was suffered as a result of reading the false report, and not as a result of acting upon it, some different principle applies. If this contention were sound, it would, in my opinion, follow that if, through an error in the stock market reports carried by nearly all daily newspapers, the quoted price of a stock was shown at one-half its true market price on that day, a person whose entire fortune was invested in that stock, reading the report and sustaining a severe nervous shock in finding that he had suffered a calamitous loss, could recover damages but if, believing the report, he immediately sold his shareholdings by private contract for much less than their true worth before discovering the error in the report, there could be no recovery. It will not do, in my opinion, to say that a person negligently, though innocently, publishing a false stock market report would not reasonably contemplate that nervous shock might be sustained by persons whose fortunes would be greatly affected if the report were true. It is a matter of common knowledge that during the depression of 1929 many persons who lost fortunes were seriously affected in health and that many people destroyed themselves. If there is any authority for the distinction other than the language employed by Wrottesley J. in Old Gate Estates v. Toplis, we have not been referred to it and I am unable to discover any. Logically, I can see no basis for any such distinction.\nIn Heaven v. Pender, Brett M.R. (later Lord Esher), in considering a claim advanced against a dock owner by a workman in the employ of a ship painter, who had contracted with a ship owner to paint the outside of a ship, for injuries sustained by the collapse of a staging outside of the ship supplied by the dock owner under contract with the ship owner, said in part (p. 509):\u2014\nThe proposition which these recognised cases suggest and which is, therefore, to be deduced from them, is that whenever one person is by circumstances placed in such a position with regard to another that every one of ordinary sense who did think would at once recognise that if he did not use ordinary care and skill in his own conduct with regard to those circumstances he would cause danger of injury to the person or property of the other, a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoid such danger. If this language was to be taken literally, it could be applied to the circumstances of the present case and it may be noted that the distinction sought to be drawn here between claims for injury to the person and claims for injury to property is not made. It is perhaps due to the fact that when in Le Lievre v. Gould [83], Lord Esher made it clear that, in his view, this statement of the law had no application where the claim was for negligent misrepresentation, that one does not find in the reports either in England or Canada decided cases in which claims were considered of the nature asserted in the present action until after the decision in Donoghue v. Stevenson in 1932.\nIn that case, Lord Atkin, referring to the above quoted statement from the judgment of Brett, M.R. in Heaven v. Pender and saying that, as framed, it was demonstrably too wide, said, following that portion of his judgment which I have quoted above at 580:\u2014\nThis appears to me to be the doctrine of Heaven v. Pender as laid down by Lord Esher (then Brett M.R.) when it is limited by the notion of proximity introduced by Lord Esher himself and A. L. Smith, L.J. in Le Lievre v. Gould.\nAfter quoting further from what had been said in Le Lievre v. Gould, Lord Atkin continued (p. 581):\u2014\nI think that this sufficiently states the truth if proximity be not confined to mere physical proximity, but be used, as I think it was intended, to extend to such close and direct relations that the act complained of directly affects a person whom the person alleged to be bound to take care would know would be directly affected by his careless act.\nWith this limitation Lord Atkin appears to have adopted the statement of Brett M.R. in Heaven v. Pender. This is the view taken by the learned author of Salmond on Torts (10th Ed. p. 434, Note X) and, as pointed out by Asquith L.J. in Candler v. Crane (p. 188), while Lord Atkin pointedly referred to Gould's case in his speech he neither hinted nor suggested that it was wrongly decided or that his statement of the law was inconsistent with it.\nAs Lindley, L.J. said in the course of his judgment in Angus v. Clifford, the controversy as to whether an action for negligent misrepresentation, as distinguished from fraudulent representation, could be maintained, was settled once and for all by the judgment of the House of Lords in Derry v. Peek. This statement must be taken to be qualified by the judgment in Nocton v. Ashburton, but the present matter does not fall within any of the exceptions which are, in my opinion, accurately enumerated in the passage from the 10th edition of Salmond on Torts above referred to. This was the state of the law when the judgment of Lord Atkin in Donoghue v. Stevenson was written and, unless he had changed his mind about the matter after he wrote his judgment in Shapiro v. La Morta, this was also his view of the law. I do not think that the passage from his judgment in Donoghue v. Stevenson was intended by him to declare the law as to the liability for negligent misstatements or to have any application to such liability. It is inconceivable, in my opinion, that if Lord Atkin and the Law Lords who agree with him in Donoghue v. Stevenson had intended to declare a principle of law inconsistent with what had been decided in the House of Lords in Derry v. Peek and Nocton v. Ashburton and by the Court of Appeal in Le Lievre v. Gould, they would not have said so in plain terms. That this is the considered view of Lord Wright is made clear from the article written by him in the Modern Law Review.\nThis appeal fails, in my opinion, and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Freeman, Freeman & Silvers.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Russel & Dumoulin.\n[1] [1952] 2 D.L.R. 479; 5 W.W.R.

The evidence disclosed that both families lived in the same city and had visited each other frequently and that the attitude of the respondent and his wife toward the child had up to the time of these proceedings been one of complete indifference. The trial judge found that the unfitness of the respondent had been established and that finding was accepted by this Court (Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. dissenting).\nJean Mercier Q.C. for the appellants.\nGeo. R. Fournier Q.C. for the respondent.\nTaschereau, J. (dissenting):\u2014Le principe fondamental qui doit guider les tribunaux dans une cause comme celle qui nous est soumise, d\u00e9coule non seulement de la loi naturelle, mais se trouve consacr\u00e9 par les dispositions de l'article 243 du Code Civil, qui veut que l'enfant demeure sous l'autorit\u00e9 de ses parents jusqu'\u00e0 sa majorit\u00e9. Cette autorit\u00e9 parentale ou puissance paternelle \u00e0 laquelle est soumis un enfant mineur, comporte pour les parents diff\u00e9rents droits, dont les droits de garde, de direction et de surveillance.\nIl peut arriver sans doute en certains cas, que cette puissance paternelle soit l'objet d'une d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance, car la jurisprudence admet que les tribunaux en cas d'abus, peuvent exercer un droit de contr\u00f4le qui les autorise \u00e0 priver le p\u00e8re ou la m\u00e8re, selon le cas, de la puissance paternelle.\nComme l'a dit M. le Juge Philippe Demers dans la cause de Moquin v. Turgeon 2:\nLe p\u00e8re, et la m\u00e8re, \u00e0 son d\u00e9faut, ont d'apr\u00e8s le droit naturel droit \u00e0 la garde de leur enfant. Pour qu'ils soient priv\u00e9s de ce droit, il ne suffit pas d'un caprice de l'enfant; il faut une raison, soit que le p\u00e8re ait abus\u00e9 de son droit, soit qu'il soit indigne ou incapable de l'exercer. Dans ces cas, \u00e9tant incapable de remplir son devoir, il ne peut r\u00e9clamer de son droit. C'est ainsi que les auteurs peuvent logiquement dire que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des enfants doit seul guider le juge.\nSe baser sur d'autres principes c'est tomber dans l'arbitraire. Qui d'ailleurs peut dire ce qui sera en d\u00e9finitive le plus avantageux pour les enfants, la garde de leur grand'm\u00e8re ou celle de leur m\u00e8re? Dieu seul le sait. Il me para\u00eet plus sage, dans le doute, de suivre la loi naturelle.\nDans Marshall v. Fournelle 3, M. le Juge Rivard disait:\u2014\nDans certaines circonstances extraordinaires, quand les parents sont incapables ou indignes d'exercer la puissance paternelle, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat bien compris de l'enfant, d'accord avec la raison, la morale et l'humanit\u00e9, peut justifier le pouvoir judiciaire d'intervenir dans l'organisation de la famille. Ce n'est alors qu'en apparence que le droit naturel est contrecarr\u00e9. Le principe reste toujours debout: c'est au p\u00e8re qu'il appartient d'\u00e9lever son enfant, et, le p\u00e8re disparu, la m\u00e8re exerce le m\u00eame pouvoir, remplit les m\u00eames obligations. Telle est la doctrine consacr\u00e9e par notre Code Civil (art. 83, 113, 165, 242, 243, 244, 245). Seuls des motifs imp\u00e9rieux et exceptionnels peuvent incliner les juges \u00e0 s'en \u00e9carter; car, ainsi qu'un tribunal de France s'est exprim\u00e9: \"Les droits qui d\u00e9rivent de la puissance paternelle sont ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 toute l\u00e9gislation et ont leur source dans la nature; et un int\u00e9r\u00eat d'ordre public, qui doit dominer tous les int\u00e9r\u00eats priv\u00e9s s'oppose \u00e0 ce qu'il soit port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 une institution que le l\u00e9gislateur n'a pas \u00e9tablie, mais qu'il ne fait que consacrer. (Puy, 10 d\u00e9c. 1869, B.P. 70. 4.64).\nTelle est, je crois, la v\u00e9ritable doctrine o\u00f9 l'on voit que ce n'est que dans les cas d'incapacit\u00e9 ou d'indignit\u00e9 de leurs parents, que les enfants mineurs sont soustraits \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 paternelle.\nIl est certain que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'enfant doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9, et doit m\u00eame \u00eatre le principal souci des tribunaux. En effet, si le p\u00e8re est incapable ou se montre indigne, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'enfant sera \u00e9videmment mis en p\u00e9ril. Mais l'int\u00e9r\u00eat et le bien-\u00eatre de l'enfant, comme l'a justement dit le Juge Rinfret dans Stevenson v. Florant 4, confirm\u00e9 par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 5, ne r\u00e9sident pas surtout dans le confort mat\u00e9riel, mais dans les soins et l'affection paternels, les avantages de l'\u00e9ducation familiale et religieuse.\nL'intim\u00e9 a deux autres enfants qui demeurent avec lui, et avec le concours de son \u00e9pouse, il les \u00e9l\u00e8ve convenablement.\nPour les raisons donn\u00e9es par mon coll\u00e8gue M. le Juge Fauteux, je suis d'opinion qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 soit indigne ou incapable d'apporter les m\u00eames soins \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation de celui qu'il r\u00e9clame par les pr\u00e9sentes proc\u00e9dures.\nJe suis d'opinion de rejeter l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nKellock J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, of the Province of Quebec 6 reversing a judgment of the Superior Court in favour of the appellants in custody proceedings instituted by the respondent, the father of the child, a boy, seven years of age.\nIt appears that shortly after the birth of the child, the latter was placed by its parents with the appellants, its uncle and aunt and godfather and godmother, the female appellant being a sister of the respondent.\nIn the Superior Court the respondent alleged that the child had been left with the appellants only temporarily for a few days as a matter of convenience to the respondent and his wife and that when the respondent in due time asked for his son, the appellants refused to give him up. The respondent further alleged that periodically from that time on, throughout the whole seven years, he had endeavoured to obtain possession of his child but without success due to the fact that the appellants hid the child and kept him from the respondent. In November of 1952, the respondent instituted the present proceedings, having in the previous July instituted proceedings for the same purpose in the Family Court which terminated adversely to him. The respondent contends that the last mentioned court was without jurisdiction and I am content to accept that view. The story, as detailed in evidence by the respondent and his wife as to the events of the seven years and their desire and efforts to obtain possession of the child, is so improbable on its face that it is not surprising that it did not find acceptance with the learned trial judge.\nThe inherent frailty of the story may be demonstrated without dealing with the whole of it. It appears, even on the respondent's own showing, that both families lived in the same city, where they met from time to time. Moreover, for a number of summers they occupied cottages within a few feet of each other, while during the summer of 1949, both families actually lived together in the same cottage. This is quite sufficient to show that the respondent's story, both as to his desire and the lack of opportunity to have his child, is completely untrue. It was so regarded by the learned trial judge.\nThe learned judge found, against the denial of the respondent and his wife, that shortly after the birth, the respondent had asked the male appellant if he would take the child, as otherwise the respondent proposed to give him to strangers. These circumstances are deposed to by a number of witnesses. It will be sufficient to quote the evidence of the appellant. Edgar Taillon, as to what passed between him and the respondent on the occasion referred to. The respondent said:\n'Edgar, est-ce que tu veux prendre l'enfant' J'ai dit: 'Pourquoi?' Ah bien, il dit: 'on n'en veut pans.' J'ai dit: 'pourquoi que tu veux pas de cet enfant-l\u00e0? Je n'ai pas eu aucune r\u00e9ponse. Il dit: 'si tu le prends pas, je vais le placer ailleurs.'\nIt was under such circumstances that the child entered the household of the appellants, who say, and the learned judge accepts their evidence, that from that time until the 9th of July, 1952, when they received a communication from the Family Court, neither the respondent nor his wife made any request of any kind for the return of the child, both being completely indifferent to the child, although they had every opportunity not only to see him but have possession of him had they so desired. In the words of the learned judge:\nce qui appert indubitablement c'est que, sauf par la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure, le requ\u00e9rant n'a jamais demand\u00e9 la possession de l'enfant.\nDuring the whole of this period the respondent contributed nothing to its support, although he received and retained the family allowance in respect of the child. The attitude of the respondent and his wife having thus been that of complete indifference toward the child throughout the whole period, the motive which prompted the launching of these proceedings assumes importance. The story advanced on behalf of the respondent not having been believed by the learned trial judge, and in my opinion being incapable of belief, the reason for their sudden change of front is left completely unexplained so far as the respondent and his spouse are concerned. There is other evidence in the record, however, which is significant.\nThe respondent in attempting an explanation why he had not instituted proceedings at an earlier date deposed that \"j'ai essay\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises\" but \"dans le temps que mon p\u00e8re vivait\" he had counselled the respondent \"m\u00e8ne donc pas de chicane dans la famille\" and that \"c'est pour pas faire de chicane\" that he had acted on this advice. It appears, however, that upon the death, the family immediately began quarrelling over the estate of the father, the respondent and his wife being ranged on one side and the appellants and the respondent's mother on the other side.\nCounsel for the respondent, in the course of the trial, referred to this \"chicane ouverte\" in the family which had broken out upon the inheritance by the respondent upon the death of his father of certain property of the latter. In the words of respondent's counsel\ndepuis ce temps-l\u00e0, entre ce clan Donaldson et le fils Donaldson, il y a eu un d\u00e9bat.\nIt is contended for the appellant that the existence of this quarrel furnishes the explanation for the seeming change of heart on the part of the respondent and for the institution of these proceedings. The record contains no other explanation. In the course of his judgment the learned trial judge found:\nQu'il est plus avantageux \u00e0 l'enfant de le laisser entre les mains des intim\u00e9s, que de lui bouleverser la vie en l'enlevant d'un milieu o\u00f9 il est tenu en affection par des gens d\u00e9vou\u00e9s, qui lui ont prodigu\u00e9 leurs soins, leur affection et leurs biens pendant sept ans, pour le renvoyer dans un milieu o\u00f9 \u00e9videmment il n'existe aucune affection ni \u00e9gard selon ce qui appert depuis ces sept ann\u00e9es;\nIt will be observed that this finding completely negatives any suggestion that the institution of these proceedings was due to the existence of any bona fide parental feeling on the part of the respondent toward his child. In my respectful opinion this appraisal of the evidence by the learned trial judge is eminently sound and, in the interests of the child, ought not to have been disturbed.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Galipeault C.J., refers to the finding of the learned trial judge set out above and adds:\nEn autant que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'enfant est concern\u00e9, je partage en tout l'opinion du savant juge.\nIl est extraordinaire que pendant sept ans, le p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re de l'enfant se soient si peu int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e0 ce dernier, bien qu'il ait v\u00e9cu bien pr\u00e8s d'eux, dans l'entourage de sa propre famille, y compris ses fr\u00e8res, lui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 si. peu d'affection. Pendant sept ans, et il n'y a pas contradiction sur le point, le p\u00e8re et la. m\u00e8re n'ont pas song\u00e9 non seulement \u00e0 se donner le moindre souci pour agr\u00e9menter le sort et la vie de l'enfant, \u00e0 lui procurer le moindre petit cadeau aux jours d'anniversaire, de No\u00ebl ou du Jour de l'An, si ce n'est lors de la derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e alors qu'on lui aurait fait parvenir une somme de $5.00 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e \u00e0 l'achat de choses utiles.\nIls n'ont jamais, sauf en ces derniers temps, s\u00e9rieusement song\u00e9 \u00e0 reprendre leur fils avec eux.\n* * *\nAu cours m\u00eame des d\u00e9positions de Marcel Donaldson et de son \u00e9pouse, on ressent bien que ce n'est pas l'affection qui les guide pour r\u00e9clamer l'enfant: il n'est pas permis d'en discerner. Il est bien s\u00fbr que le proc\u00e8s, la mise en exercice de l'autorit\u00e9 paternelle ou la revendication de l'enfant proviennent d'une m\u00e9sentente entre le p\u00e8re et la m\u00e8re d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, l'oncle et la tante de l'autre. Un drame de famille dont, \u00e0 mon avis, l'enfant sera victime.\nIl a aujourd'hui sept ans, l'\u00e2ge de raison, et l'on sait ce qui peut na\u00eetre et cro\u00eetre dans le cerveau d'un enfant de cet \u00e2ge quand il se croit injustement trait\u00e9, victime d'injustice. Ayant re\u00e7u pendant sept ans beaucoup d'affection, quelle pourra \u00eatre l'influence sur sa personnalit\u00e9 s'il ne rencontre que de l'indiff\u00e9rence. Jusqu'ici, pour ses p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 un \u00e9tranger.\n* * *\nExiste-t-il suffisamment au dossier pour en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que l'appelant et son \u00e9pouse sont indignes d'exercer l'autorit\u00e9 paternelle? J'avoue que ce serait mon avis, et le juge de premi\u00e8re instance qui ne l'a pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 express\u00e9ment, le laisse bien entendre dans le Consid\u00e9rant que j'ai rapport\u00e9 ci-dessus.\nNotwithstanding, however, the learned Chief Justice felt that the authorities did not permit him to act upon this view and he therefore concurred in allowing the appeal, but he did so\nAvec beaucoup d'h\u00e9sitation et de r\u00e9pugnance, je crois devoir ne pas enregistrer une dissidence \u00e0 l'encontre de l'information du jugement.\nIn my respectful view, the authorities, properly understood, required a different conclusion upon the facts of this case.\nSt-Jacques J., with whom Gagn\u00e9 J., concurred, was influenced in the conclusion to which he came by certain evidence given by the female appellant in which she had said that if the parents of the child had ever asked for his return, she would have acceded to it. The learned judge found it difficult to accord this evidence with the course followed by the appellants in defending the proceedings when actually brought.\nWith respect, I think that what the witness was saying was that if the parents of the child had shown any genuine interest in him throughout the seven years of his life before the proceedings were launched, the appellants would have acceded to their desire, but that the attitude of the parents being what it was, the proceedings were not the result of any genuine parental affection for the child but were prompted by the ulterior motive which the evidence reveals. In such circumstances the appellants had defended.\nIn my respectful opinion, the real effect of all the evidence as well as the findings of the learned trial judge were not properly appreciated in the court below and there was resulting error.\nIt is well settled that the normal right of the parents to the custody of a child is displaced where it is shown that \"indignit\u00e9\" or unfitness to have such custody exists. The fact that the respondent and his wife were bringing up two other children and had not been shown \"indigne\" with respect to them appears to have had considerable weight in the court appealed from. It is to be observed, however, that the fitness of the parents to have custody of those children was not an issue in these proceedings, nor does it follow that merely because a parent may be fit to have the custody of some of his children the question is thereby concluded as to all. As was said by the present Chief Justice of this court in Dugal v. Lefebvre 7:\nSans chercher \u00e0 accabler le requ\u00e9rant, dont il faut, par ailleurs, reconna\u00eetre les nombreux m\u00e9rites et qui \u00e9videmment a fort bien \u00e9lev\u00e9 ses autres enfants, il est malheureusent difficile (parce que c'est notre devoir) de lui \u00e9viter le reproche qu'il para\u00eet avoir n\u00e9glig\u00e9 et abandonn\u00e9 l'enfant qui est en cause \u2026\nRinfret J., as he then was, went on to say:\nL'autorit\u00e9 paternelle n'accorde pas seulement des droits, elle comporte aussi des devoirs. Ils sont inscrits dans le code. Et si les parents d\u00e9sirent que les tribunaux les aident \u00e0 conserver l'affection et l'attachement de leurs enfants, il faut au moins qu'eux-m\u00eames s'y int\u00e9ressent.\nIn the same case Cannon J., said, at p. 510:\nJe crois qu'il est maintenant admis par la doctrine que les droits et pouvoirs du p\u00e8re et de la m\u00e8re sur la personne des enfants mineurs ne leur sont accord\u00e9s que comme cons\u00e9quence des lourds devoirs qu'ils ont \u00e0 remplir et n'ont d'autre but que de leur rendre possible l'entretien et l'\u00e9ducation de l'enfant. C'est pour la protection de l'enfant que l'autorit\u00e9 'parentale' existe.\nAnd at page 511:\nL'esprit de la loi\u2014et le requ\u00e9rant l'a oubli\u00e9\u2014n'est pas favorable \u00e0 l'exercice arbitraire de son autorit\u00e9 quand les circonstances exigent de fortes raisons pour bouleverser la situation faite au mineur par l'acte m\u00eame du p\u00e8re en le confiant, d\u00e8s son bas \u00e2ge, \u00e0 des parents de sa d\u00e9funte femme.\nIn Dugal's case the child there in question, who was over fifteen, did not desire to return to the father. That element is not present in the case at bar, which falls to be decided upon the fitness or otherwise of the respondent. In my opinion, if the findings of the learned trial judge be accepted, as in my opinion they should be, such unfitness has been fully made out. I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at trial with costs.\nEstey, J.:\u2014The respondent, the father of Joseph-Edgar-Michel Donaldson (hereafter referred to as Michel), by way of habeas corpus proceedings seeks to obtain possession of Michel who, since the date of his birth, has resided with the appellants, his aunt and uncle, Mme. Taillon being the sister of the respondent.\nMichel was born October 18, 1945, and was at the time of the trial a little more than seven years of age. The parties hereto have apparently been friendly throughout these seven years and, while the evidence at the trial was most contradictory on many relevant points, it is clear that on the date of his baptism his father asked the appellants to care for him at least for a short ime.\nMichel, after his birth, was retained at the hospital for some time and taken directly therefrom by his father to the home of the appellants. The latter have in every way cared for him and provided for his keep. He has always been known by his own name and was so registered at church and school. While the parents have received the mother's allowance, apart from the sum of $5.00 they have contributed nothing to his upkeep. They contend that throughout the years they have been repeatedly refused the custody of their child by the appellants and that the latter have, at times, sought to hide and conceal Michel from them. On the other hand the appellants depose that the parents have never requested his custody and had they done so they would have surrendered him. Moreover, they depose that they have taken him to visit with his parents at the latter's home, but that his parents have at all times looked to the appellants to care and provide for him.\nThe evidence is in many respects most contradictory and it is a case in which the language of my Lord the Chief Justice (then Rinfret J.) in Dugal v. Lefebvre 8, is applicable:\nLa d\u00e9cision qu'il s'agit de rendre est souvent fort d\u00e9licate et d\u00e9pend dans une large mesure de l'exercice d'une sage discr\u00e9tion\u2014discr\u00e9tion judiciaire, bien entendu, mais que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance est mieux plac\u00e9 pour exercer, parce qu'il a l'avantage de voir les personnes et qu'il est m\u00eal\u00e9 de plus pr\u00e8s aux circonstances sp\u00e9ciales de chaque cause.\nThe learned trial judge accepted the evidence of the appellants wherever there was conflict and finds:\nil n'existe aucune affection ni \u00e9gard selon ce qui appert depuis ces sept ann\u00e9es.\nThe relevant law is stated by my Lord the Chief Justice (then Rinfret J.) in Stevenson v. Florant 9:\nL'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'enfant, qu'il faut prendre en consid\u00e9ration, son bien-\u00eatre, ne r\u00e9sident pas surtout dans le confort mat\u00e9riel, mais dans les soins et l'affection paternels, dans les avantages de l'\u00e9ducation familiale et religieuse. Le chagrin passager que l'enfant va, sans doute, ressentir en laissant ceux avec qui il a v\u00e9cu et qui furent bons pour lui, et en changeant d'entourage, ne saurait se comparer \u00e0 la satisfaction permanente et au bonheur solide qu'il ne tardera pas \u00e0 \u00e9prouver en r\u00e9alisant qu'il est d\u00e9sormais chez lui, dans sa demeure, par droit de naissance et non plus en vertu de la bienfaisance d'un \u00e9tranger qui n'a pas envers lui d'obligation l\u00e9gale; (Brown v. Partridge, 1925\u20141 W.W.R. 378, confirm\u00e9 par cette cour le 13 mai 1925) ; en grandissant dans l'honneur et le respect pour ses parents (art. 242 C.C.), \u00e0 l'ombre de leur autorit\u00e9 (art. 243 et seq.). C'est l\u00e0 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat bien compris de l'enfant d'accord avec celui de la famille et de l'\u00e9tat.\nThe evidence does not disclose any particular difference between the ability of the respective parties hereto to contribute to the material well-being of Michel but, upon the finding of the learned trial judge, which is supported by the evidence, there does not appear to be present at the home of the respondent that natural parental care and affection which the foregoing statement of the law contemplates but which is present at the home of the appellants. In this regard the learned trial judge stated as follows:\n\u2026 il est tenu en affection par des gens d\u00e9vou\u00e9s, qui lui ont prodigu\u00e9 leurs soins, leur affection et leurs biens pendant sept ans, pour le renvoyer dans un milieu o\u00f9 \u00e9videmment il n'existe aucune affection ni \u00e9gard selon ce qui appert depuis ces sept ann\u00e9es. While the interests of an infant may normally best be served in the home of his parents, in circumstances such as here present, where the child's welfare must be the paramount consideration, the finding of the learned trial judge, who had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses, that there is absent from the home of his parents one of the most important essentials in the life of a child but which is present in the home of those in whose custody he has been, ought to be accepted, unless there is in his finding some manifest error. In this case the conduct of the appellants, from the date of Michel's birth until at least a short time before these proceedings were commenced, supports the learned trial judge's finding. Moreover, the record does not disclose any fact or circumstance which it can be said the learned trial judge has overlooked or misconstrued and that might constitute a manifest error.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nCartwright J.:\u2014The relevant facts out of which this appeal arises are set out in the judgment of my brother Kellock. I agree with his reasons and with those of my brother Estey and I wish to add only a few words.\nIn my opinion the principles of law applicable to a case in which the Court is called upon to decide whether an infant child is to be returned to the custody of its parents or to remain in that of others with whom it has lived for a long period are well settled. As was said by Middleton J. in re Steacy 10:\nIn all the law relating to the custody of children, the true welfare of the child is being ever more clearly written as the fundamental axiom to which all other considerations must in the end yield.\nIt is equally well established that the parental right to the custody of a child is not to be interfered with unless there exist reasons for so doing which are, to use the words of Rinfret J., as he then was, in Dugal v. Lefebvre 11, \"s\u00e9rieuses et exceptionnelles\", or, to use those of Lord Esher M.R. in The Queen v. Gyngall 12 \"very serious and important.\"\nI find nothing in the reasons of the learned trial judge to suggest that he did not apply these rules. The salient facts, established by the evidence which he believed, are that, for some reason which does not appear, the parents of this child have been throughout his life devoid of all natural affection for him and that they now seek his custody not because of any belated awakening of such affection but by. reason of a disagreement with the appellants, who admittedly love the child as dearly and have cherished him as carefully as if he were their own and desire to continue to do so. It is not surprising to find that there was no contradiction of the evidence of the doctor who has attended the child throughout his life-time and expressed the opinion that his removal from the only home he has ever known to that of his parents would cause him grave injury. In the facts thus briefly summarized the learned trial judge, who has had great experience and who had the advantage of seeing all the parties, found the very serious and important reasons necessary to require the Court to refuse to give effect to the prima facie right of the parents to have the custody of their child. In my respectful view his decision was right.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Kellock.\nFauteux J. (dissenting) :\u2014Il s'agit d'un appel d'un jugement unanime de la Cour du Banc de la Reine de la province de Quebec 13 maintenant, avec d\u00e9pens, un bref d'habeas corpus.

D'ailleurs, \u00e0 l'audition devant cette Cour, cette proposition de droit n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet d'aucune discussion.\nAu m\u00e9rite. Dans la consid\u00e9ration de pareils litiges, les tribunaux seraient impuissants \u00e0 se lib\u00e9rer de l'angoisse s'attachant \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 rendre, n'\u00e9tait-ce la clart\u00e9 avec laquelle les principes, auxquels ils doivent recourir, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis. On les retrouve formul\u00e9s particuli\u00e8rement aux d\u00e9cisions suivantes:\u2014 Stevenson v. Florant (supra) confirm\u00e9e par le comit\u00e9 judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 16; Marshall v. Fournelle 17, confirmant le jugement des Cours inf\u00e9rieures 18; Kivenko v. Yagod 19; Dugal v. Lefebvre (supra). De la jurisprudence, il appara\u00eet clairement que ce qui domine la question, c'est l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'enfant. Il ne s'agit pas, cependant, d'un int\u00e9r\u00eat purement mat\u00e9riel, passager ou en quelque sorte \u00e9tranger \u00e0 l'organisation de la famille. Dans toutes ces dispositions du Code Civil sanctionnant la reconnaissance, le maintien et le d\u00e9veloppement de cette institution naturelle qu'est celle de la famille, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'enfant a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet d'une particuli\u00e8re consid\u00e9ration du L\u00e9gislateur et, de cet int\u00e9r\u00eat, on ne saurait cons\u00e9quemment se faire une conception nettement juridique sans tenir compte des droits et obligations qui y sont \u00e9tablis. Bref, on peut difficilement traduire et r\u00e9sumer le v\u00e9ritable esprit de la loi sur le point en termes meilleurs que ceux employ\u00e9s par M. le Juge Rivard, de la Cour d'Appel, dans la cause de Marshall v. Fournelle (supra), termes approuv\u00e9s par cette Cour dans Dugal v. Lefebvre (supra):\u2014\nDans certaines circonstances extraordinaires, quand les parents sont incapables ou indignes d'exercer la puissance paternelle, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat bien compris de l'enfant, d'accord avec la raison, la morale et l'humanit\u00e9, peut justifier le pouvoir judiciaire d'intervenir dans l'organisation de la famille. Ce n'est alors qu'en apparence que le droit naturel est contrecarr\u00e9. Le principe reste toujours debout; c'est au p\u00e8re qu'il appartient d'\u00e9lever son enfant, et, le p\u00e8re disparu, la m\u00e8re exerce le m\u00eame pouvoir, remplit les m\u00eames obligations. Telle est la doctrine consacr\u00e9e par notre Code Civil (art. 83, 113, 165, 242, 243, 244, 245). Seuls des motifs imp\u00e9rieux et exceptionnels peuvent incliner les juges \u00e0 s'en \u00e9carter; car, ainsi qu'un tribunal de France s'est exprim\u00e9: \"Les droits qui d\u00e9rivent de la puissance paternelle sont ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 toute l\u00e9gislation et ont leur source dans la nature ; et un int\u00e9r\u00eat d'ordre public, qui doit dominer tous les int\u00e9r\u00eats priv\u00e9s s'oppose \u00e0 ce qu'il soit port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 une institution que le l\u00e9gislateur n'a pas \u00e9tablie, mais qu'il ne fait que consacrer.\" (Puy, 10 d\u00e9c. 1869, B.P. 70.4.64).\nCe n'est donc que dans des circonstances extraordinaires et pour des motifs imp\u00e9rieux et exceptionnels, telles l'incapacit\u00e9 ou l'indignit\u00e9 du titulaire l\u00e9gal aussi bien que naturel du droit \u00e0 la puissance paternelle, que les Juges peuvent s'\u00e9carter de ces principes.\nEn l'esp\u00e8ce, on ne conteste pas que le p\u00e8re ou, \u00e0 son d\u00e9faut, la m\u00e8re, soit capable d'exercer la puissance paternelle.\nOn a conc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e9galement, \u00e0 l'audition, que l'intim\u00e9 et son \u00e9pouse \u00e9l\u00e8vent tr\u00e8s bien leurs deux autres enfants, les deux fr\u00e8res de Michel. C'est l\u00e0 reconna\u00eetre qu'ils sont dignes,\u2014au moins \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ces deux fils,\u2014de remplir les charges et d'exercer les droits \u00e0 eux conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le droit naturel et reconnus par la loi. Quant au cas de Michel, le reproche d'indignit\u00e9 formul\u00e9 par les appelants reposerait, en substance, sur la double accusation (i) qu'ils l'auraient abandonn\u00e9 quelques jours apr\u00e8s sa naissance et (ii) qu'ils s'en seraient, depuis lors, totalement d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9s.\nLa preuve ne permet pas d'affirmer que cet enfant a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9 \u00e0 sa naissance par ses parents quand, de fait,\u2014 et c'est l\u00e0 l'expression du Juge de premi\u00e8re instance,\u2014il a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 par eux \u00e0 ses oncle et tante, les appelants, et ce dans des circonstances dont il faut tenir compte. A ce temps, les deux \u00e9poux Donaldson n'avaient pas leur propre r\u00e9sidence. On vivait chez les grands-parents. De plus, la m\u00e8re \u00e9tait de sant\u00e9 pr\u00e9caire et avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 sous ses soins un b\u00e9b\u00e9 de dix-sept mois, lui-m\u00eame malade. Ceux \u00e0 qui ils confi\u00e8rent alors leur enfant, soit les appelants, outre d'\u00eatre oncle et tante de l'enfant, \u00e9taient \u00e9galement ses parrain et marraine. Etant eux-m\u00eames sans enfant et, de toute apparence, sans soucis financiers, ils paraissent avoir accept\u00e9 cette addition \u00e0 leur foyer comme un bonheur comblant un vide et compensant plus que la charge nouvelle. Somme toute, il faut reconna\u00eetre que meilleur foyer, pour leur enfant, ne pouvait \u00eatre trouv\u00e9 par les intim\u00e9s dans les circonstances. Il est vrai que, suivant certains t\u00e9moins dont l'hostilit\u00e9 s'av\u00e8re \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, le p\u00e8re aurait, en l'occurrence, fait certaines d\u00e9clarations qui, tenues comme prouv\u00e9es et prises au pied de la lettre aussi bien que sans tenir compte des circonstances ci-dessus, seraient aptes \u00e0 mettre en doute les sentiments qu'il pouvait avoir alors \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de cet enfant. Ces t\u00e9moignages ne correspondent pas, cependant, au r\u00e9cit de l'incident fait par lui et son \u00e9pouse. A cela, on pourrait ajouter que la preuve, d'autre part, r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00e9galement certaines d\u00e9clarations des appelants eux-m\u00eames \u00e0 l'enfant Michel,\u2014c'est une dame Beaulieu qui en t\u00e9moigne, \u2014d\u00e9clarations dont l'effet est manifestement d'enlever le respect que cet enfant doit \u00e0 son p\u00e8re et dont la teneur est loin de sugg\u00e9rer l'affection des appelants vis-\u00e0-vis l'enfant. Aussi bien, cette accusation d'abandon ne peut \u00eatre tenue comme s\u00e9rieuse.\nQuant au reproche que, durant sept ans, les intim\u00e9s n'auraient fait aucune d\u00e9marche pour reprendre leur enfant en leur domicile et s'en seraient en quelque sorte d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9s, il faut reconna\u00eetre que, dans une certaine mesure, il n'est pas sans fondement. Durant cette p\u00e9riode, les appelants affirment avoir r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement conduit l'enfant en visite chez ses p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re et, de cela, ces derniers paraissent bien, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, s'\u00eatre satisfaits. Et ce n'est que quelques mois avant l'\u00e9mission du bref qu'ils ont manifestement fait des d\u00e9marches s\u00e9rieuses pour reprendre leur enfant. La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s par eux adopt\u00e9s \u00e0 la Cour du Bien-Etre Social, avant d'initier la pr\u00e9sente action, sugg\u00e8re bien, cependant, la r\u00e9sistance anticip\u00e9e des appelants \u00e0 leur remettre leur enfant. Toutes les circonstances r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es par la preuve permettent-elles de frapper, et \u00e0 tout jamais, les intim\u00e9s d'indignit\u00e9 de reprendre leur enfant et satisfaire \u00e0 son endroit \u00e0 leurs obligations naturelles aussi bien que l\u00e9gales? En pr\u00e9sence de l'admission faite \u00e0 l'audition par les appelants que les intim\u00e9s \u00e9l\u00e8vent bien leurs deux autres fils et, cons\u00e9quemment, qu'ils sont dignes de la garde de ces derniers, comment conclure que cette indignit\u00e9 n'existerait que quant \u00e0 Michel? Le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance n'a pas voulu prendre la responsabilit\u00e9 d'exprimer ce motif pour asseoir son jugement. Son refus \u00e0 ce faire est significatif. Et la Cour d'Appel, dans son jugement formel et unanime, en est venue \u00e0 conclure :\n\u2026 que, la preuve d\u00e9montre que le requ\u00e9rant (l'intim\u00e9, p\u00e8re de Michel) est un homme de bonne r\u00e9putation, qu'il gagne honorablement sa vie et celle de sa famille et qu'il est digne de reprendre son enfant pour l'\u00e9lever avec ses deux autres fr\u00e8res plus jeunes.\nDans les difficult\u00e9s qui se seraient \u00e9lev\u00e9es entre les parties autour d'une affaire de pi\u00e8tre importance se rattachant \u00e0 une succession, on a voulu deviner un motif, et m\u00eame l'unique motif, inspirant les intim\u00e9s \u00e0 reprendre leur enfant. Pourrait-on \u00e9galement y trouver celui promouvant l'obstination des appelants \u00e0 ne pas le rendre? En cela, je ne puis, pour ma part, soit dit en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, trouver aucun appui pour troubler l'ordre juridique et affecter fondamentalement les droits des parties. En fait, et s'il faut n\u00e9cessairement, de cette chicane d'affaires entre les parties, d\u00e9celer des motifs, je croirais plut\u00f4t que l'animosit\u00e9 en r\u00e9sultant, et qui aurait elle-m\u00eame comme cons\u00e9quence,\u2014suivant la pr\u00e9tention des appelants,\u2014ce d\u00e9bat sur la personne de l'enfant, ne pourrait, si ce dernier continue de demeurer hors son foyer naturel, que se perp\u00e9tuer au grand d\u00e9savantage de ce dernier. Reconna\u00eetre que les appelants ont trait\u00e9 cet enfant comme s'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 le leur suscite naturellement \u00e0 leur endroit une juste sympathie qui ne saurait, cependant, autoriser la mise \u00e0 l'\u00e9cart des droits et obligations sup\u00e9rieurs et permanents du p\u00e8re et de la m\u00e8re, suivant les principes auxquels il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9. \u00c9galement, la reconnaissance du m\u00eame fait n'ajoute rien \u00e0 la preuve soumise par les appelants contre les intim\u00e9s et ne justifie pas, contre ces derniers, une conclusion d'indignit\u00e9. La loi pr\u00e9sume la dignit\u00e9 des parents. Celui qui invoque l'indignit\u00e9 doit la prouver. Devant cette pr\u00e9somption et la gravit\u00e9 de la mati\u00e8re, une preuve claire et solide s'impose. Je ne puis accepter comme suffisante la preuve offerte par les appelants. Le bref d'habeas corpus doit donc \u00eatre maintenu.\nSans doute l'enfant, comme il arrive en tous ces cas, en subira certains d\u00e9savantages, mais ces d\u00e9savantages qu'il faut anticipier, pas plus que ceux que l'expert entendu, \u00e0 l'initiative des appelants, envisage comme possibles, ne doivent faire obstacle au droit et faire oublier totalement la consid\u00e9ration des avantages d'ordre fondamental et permanent que l'enfant doit raisonnablement trouver au foyer naturel avec ses p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re et ses deux fr\u00e8res. Comme il fut signal\u00e9 par cette Cour dans la cause de Stevenson v. Florant:\u2014\nLe chagrin passager que l'enfant va, sans doute, ressentir en laissant ceux avec qui il a v\u00e9cu et qui furent bons pour lui, et en changeant d'entourage, ne saurait se comparer \u00e0 la satisfaction permanente et au bonheur solide qu'il ne tardera pas \u00e0 \u00e9prouver en r\u00e9alisant qu'il est d\u00e9sormais chez lui, dans sa demure, par droit de naissance et non plus en vertu de la bienfaisance d'un \u00e9tranger qui n'a pas envers lui d'obligation l\u00e9gale (Brown vs Partridge, confirm\u00e9 par cette Cour, le 13 mai 1925); en grandissant dans l'honneur et le respect pour ses parents (art. 242 C.C.) \u00e0 l'ombre de leur autorit\u00e9 (arts 243 et seq.). C'est l\u00e0 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat bien compris de l'enfant d'accord avec celui de la famille et de l'\u00c9tat.\" Suivant le mot du chancelier Boyd, in re: D'ANDREA: the normal well ordered home is unquestionably preferable to the foster home, however well ordered. Ce que LAURENT exprime en d'autres termes (vol. LV, p. 368); \"Mais il ne s'agit pas ici de la libert\u00e9 individuelle; il s'agit de sanctionner un droit qui est \u00e9tabli dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat m\u00eame de l'enfant. Son droit \u00e0 lui consiste \u00e0 \u00eatre \u00e9lev\u00e9; or, pour qu'il puisse l'\u00eatre, il faut qu'il soit sous la garde de son p\u00e8re.\"\nJe confirmerais le jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine et renverrais l'appel, avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Mercier & Cantin.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Geo.

Code ss. 827(5), 982\u2014Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 59, ss. 12, 23, 24, 25.\nThe original owner of a motor car sold it subject to a conditional sales contract which provided title should remain in the vendor until the purchase price was paid in full. The owner assigned his title to the appellant, a finance company. An unpaid balance was outstanding when one R., a stranger to the transaction by which the appellant acquired title, was arrested when in possession of the car and on a summary trial before a county court judge, pleaded guilty to a charge of unlawfully selling a narcotic drug contrary to s. 4(1) (f) of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929 (Can.) c. 49. Following sentence by the judge, to secure forfeiture of the car under s. 21 of the Act, which provides that when a person is convicted of an offence against the Act, any motor car proved to have been used in connection with the offence shall be forfeited to Her Majesty, counsel for the Crown filed a certificate under the seal of the court, signed by the deputy court clerk certifying that R. had pleaded guilty as charged and had been sentenced. The appellant objected to admission of the certificate as proof of conviction but was overruled and the car declared forfeited. A Petition of Right praying a declaration that the suppliant was the owner of the car as against the respondent, judgment for possession of the car or in the alternative the sum of $1,800, was dismissed by the Exchequer Court. On appeal to this court appellant argued that the trial judge erred:\n(i) In adjudging that s. 21, insofar as it operated to forfeit the appellant's motor car, was intra vires Parliament since such forfeiture was not necessarily incidental to the effective exercise of the legislative authority of Parliament over the criminal law.\n(ii) In adjudging that the accused had been convicted as charged, in that such conviction was not proved by admissible evidence, and that the document which purported to establish a plea of guilty, did not do so.\nHeld: (1)\u2014That the forfeiture of property used in the commission of a criminal offence is an integral part of the criminal law, a subject matter of legislation by s. 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, committed to the Parliament of Canada and s. 21 of The Opium and Drug Act, 1929 is therefore intra vires Parliament. Per: Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey, and Cartwright JJ. In the circumstances of the case the conviction was sufficiently proved by the certificate which fulfilled all the requirements of s. 982 of the Criminal Code and of s. 12(2) of the Canada Evidence Act. Had the objection been that it did not strictly comply with s. 23 of the latter Act, it might have been excluded, but since an adjournment could have been granted to permit the obtaining of a copy of the record, certified as contemplated by s. 23, effect should not be given to the objection raised.\nKellock J. agreed with the appellant's contention that neither s. 982 of the Code nor s. 12 of the Canada Evidence Act were relevant but held that the certificate was within s. 23. of the latter.\nHeld: (2)\u2014(Locke J. dissenting). That the conviction of R. was sufficiently proved by the certificate tendered in evidence.\nPer: Locke J. (dissenting). Section 982 of the Code has no application in civil proceedings. The provisions of s. 12 of the Canada Evidence Act were irrevelant and the certificate did not comply with s. 23 of that Act. The document tendered in evidence was inadmissible as proof of any fact. Even if its acceptance had not been objected to by the appellant, the Court itself should have disregarded it. (Jacker v. International Cable Co. 5 T.L.R. 13). The record did not support the contention that counsel for the appellant had consented to the fact of the conviction being proved by the document.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, 1, Cameron J., dismissing the appellant's Petition of Right whereby it sought a declaration that it was the owner of a motor car forfeited under s. 21 of The Opium and Drug Act, 1929 as against the respondent, judgment for possession of the car, or in the alternative damages.\nH. F. Parkinson, Q.C. and W. J. Anderson for the appellant.\nF. P. Varcoe, Q.C. and J. T. Gray for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Taschereau, JJ. was delivered by:\nKerwin J.:\u2014A Plymouth sedan was seized and forfeited to His Majesty in His right of Canada under the provisions of section 21 of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, c. 49:\u2014\n21. When any person is convicted of an offence against this Act, the opium pipe or other article or the drug in respect of which the offence was committed and all receptacles of any kind whatsoever found containing the same, and any vehicle, motor car, automobile, boat, canoe, aeroplane or conveyance of any description, proved to have contained such opium pipe or other article or drug or to have been used in any manner in connection with the offence for which such person has been so convicted, and any moneys used for the purchase of such drug, shall be forfeited to His Majesty, and shall be delivered to the Minister for disposition. The original owner of the sedan has sold it, in the Province of Ontario, under a conditional sale contract to one Ciampi, and later the original owner assigned to the appellant the contract under which a considerable sum remains owing and unpaid. In June, 1951, the sedan was seized at Windsor, Ontario, while in the possession of a stranger to the transaction by which the appellant had acquired its title. That stranger, under the name of Patrick Charles Riley, pleaded guilty to a charge of having illegally sold a narcotic drug contrary to s. 4(1) (f) of the Act and was thereupon sentenced in a County Court Judges' Criminal Court. The judge of that Court found, and so certified, that the sedan had been used in the commission of the offence. The forfeiture followed and the appellant by petition of right claims a declaration that it is the owner of the sedan and judgment for possession, or in the alternative, $1,800. For the reasons given by my brother Cartwright I agree that there is no substance in the contention of the appellant that the conviction was not properly proved and that the offender was not shewn to be the same person as Patrick Charles Riley mentioned in the respondent's defence.\nOn the other question, s. 21 of the Act is, in my opinion, within the competence of Parliament as it is part and parcel of \"The Criminal Law \u2026 including the Proceedings in Criminal Matters\" which, by head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, is within the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament: A.G. for Ontario v. Hamilton Street Ry. 2; Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. A.G. for Canada 3. The mere fact that s. 21 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act affects property and civil rights is of no concern since in pith and substance it does not attempt to invade the provincial legislative field. It provides for the forfeiture of property used in the commission of a criminal offence and is, therefore, legislation in relation to criminal law. As early as 1896 this Court in O'Neil v. A.G. of Canada 4, brushed aside an argument that certain legislation of the Parliament of Canada was invalid as being \"so destitute of any reasonable foundation that it calls for no observation.\" Chief Justice Strong pointed out the peculiar nature of the proceedings but made the remark quoted with reference to the contention that the confiscation of certain moneys under s. 575 of the 1892 Criminal Code was illegal as being an interference with property and civil rights in the Province. That section provided that a magistrate might authorize a constable who had reported in writing that there were good grounds for belief that a house, place, etc., was kept and used as a common gaming house, to enter therein and seize money; and the section also provided that \"any money or securities seized under this section shall be forfeited to the Crown for the public uses of Canada.\"\nI do not deal with those sections of the Criminal Code providing for forfeiture or dealing with what might be argued are civil rights because they are not in question upon this appeal. Nor do I find it necessary to consider the provisions for forfeiture under the Acts respecting customs and excise since those topics fall within s. 122 of the British North America Act: A.G. for British Columbia v. McDonald Murphy Lumber Co. 5, referred to in A.G. for British Columbia v. Kingcombe Navigation Co. 6. The constitutional validity of a provision of the Excise Act was not in issue in The King v. Krakowec 7, and I mention the decision only because this Court had no difficulty in determining that the relevant enactment governed the vehicle although its legal owner had no knowledge of the illegal use which was being made of it.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRand J.:\u2014Several questions were raised on the argument of this appeal, but the only one of substance is that which challenges the validity of s, 21 of the Opium and Narcotics Drug Act, c. 24 of the Statutes 1929. The section reads:\u2014 (The section is set out at p. 274).\nThe Industrial Company is the owner under a conditional sale of an automobile which was shown to have been used in connection with an offence committed against the Act by a man named Riley and was seized as forfeited under the section quoted. Riley was not the original purchaser of the car and no connection between him and the purchaser was shown. No contention is made that the language of the section does not extend to every interest or title in the car, and the case for the appellant is that the section so interpreted is ultra vires of Parliament.\nThe forfeiture of property used in violation of revenue laws has for several centuries been one of the characteristic features of their enforcement and the considerations which early led to its adoption as necessary are not far to seek. Smuggling, illegal manufacture of liquors, illegal sale of narcotics and like activities, because of their high profits and the demand, in certain sections of society, for them, take on the character of organized action against the forces of law; and with the techniques and devices, varying with the times, that have been open to these enemies of social order, the necessity to strike against not only the persons but everything that has enabled them to carry out their purposes has been universally recognized.\nIn Canada this view has been followed from the earliest times. By c. 5, statutes of Upper Canada 1801, dealing with goods imported from the United States, s. 11 provided:\u2014\n\u2026 And where the value, according to the highest market price of the same, shall amount to twenty pounds, the vessel, boat, raft, or carriage, with the tackle, apparel, furniture, cattle, harness, and horse or horses thereto respectively belonging, shall also become forfeited, and shall and may be seized by the said Collector or deputy, subject nevertheless to condemnation by due course of law.\nC. 11 of the statutes of 1824, repealing the foregoing Act, provided in s. 9 that\nIf any master or person having the charge or command of any vessel, boat, raft, or carriage, shall make a false report, such vessel, boat, raft or carriage, and the tackle, apparel, furniture, cattle, horse or horses, and harness thereunto respectively belonging, shall be forfeited and liable to seizure by the Collector.\nand by s. 10:\u2014\nThat all the goods, wares or merchandise which shall be imported into this province from the United States of America, and which shall not be entered according to the provisions of this Act shall be forfeited, together with the vessel, boat, raft, or carriage, in or upon which the same shall be found or shall have been imported, and the tackle, apparel, furniture, cattle, horse or horses, and harness thereunto respectively belonging.\nThese provisions, in varying language and more detailed application, have been continued to the present day. The laws dealing with smuggling and excise violations in Great Britain were consolidated by c. 53 of 7-8 George IV, s. 32 of which contains similar language attaching forfeiture to property used in connection with the offences mentioned.\nFrom this uniform legislative judgment, it is at once apparent that forfeiture has from the beginning been treated as one of the necessary conditions for compelling substantial obedience to revenue laws. It was conceded that so far as it applied to the property of the offender, no question of validity arose; but long experience has shown that the seizure of such property cannot be made the starting point for civil contests over ownership. The absolute forfeiture is an inseparable accompaniment of punitive action, and the administration of the law would be seriously impeded were any obstacles to prompt and conclusive action placed in the way of its enforcement.\nThese considerations apply a fortiori to the suppression of such an evil as the narcotics traffic. Here, not the revenue, but the health as well as the moral and social condition of the community are endangered by a most insidious and destructive exploitation of human weakness. The difficulties attending its detection are multiplied many fold and the necessity for these strict and unqualified measures correspondingly greater.\nThe forfeiture of property used in the commission of such offences is then an integral part of criminal law, a subject matter of legislation by s. 91 committed to the Dominion Parliament and the contention against its validity must be rejected with costs.\nKellock J.:\u2014For the reasons given by my brother Rand, I think that s. 21 of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, is intra vires the Parliament of Canada. The only other point in the appeal with which I desire to deal is the submission on behalf of the appellant that there is no proof of the conviction of the appellant.\nIt is provided by s. 4(1) of the statute that\nEvery person who \u2026 sells \u2026 shall be guilty of an offence, and shall be liable (i) upon indictment, to imprisonment \u2026 or (ii) upon summary conviction \u2026 to imprisonment \u2026\nIn paragraph (ii) above, \"upon indictment\" means unquestionably, \"upon conviction upon indictment\". The word \"conviction\" by itself is ambiguous. It may be used to include both verdict and judgment thereupon, or as meaning verdict only. In my view, it is quite plain that in s. 21 the word is used in the sense of verdict only. The judgment thereupon is quite immaterial for the purposes of the section.\nIn The Queen v. Blaby 8, the prisoner was tried for feloniously uttering counterfeit coin upon an indictment under 24 & 25 Vict. c. 99, s. 12, which, after charging her with the misdemeanour of unlawfully uttering a counterfeit coin in 1894, proceeded to charge her with a previous conviction in 1888 for a similar offence. It concluded in the usual form, that the prisoner had feloniously uttered the counterfeit coin on the second occasion. S. 9 of the statute provided that a person who utters counterfeit coin is guilty of a misdemeanour and \"being convicted thereof\" is liable to imprisonment. By s. 12, a person who has been convicted of a misdemeanour under s. 9 and afterwards commits a misdemeanour mentioned in that section, is guilty of felony, \"and being convicted thereof\" is liable to penal servitude.\nThe prisoner was given in charge upon the first part of the indictment only, which charged the unlawful uttering in 1894; to this charge she pleaded guilty. She was then given in charge upon the second part of the indictment, which charged the previous conviction, to which she pleaded not guilty. The certificate as to the earlier conviction showed that she had been released upon finding a recognizance to come up for judgment when called upon.\nThe prisoner's counsel submitted that in order to constitute a conviction, there must be both verdict and judgment; that the certificate showed that no judgment had been pronounced against the prisoner but only an order made empowering her to be released upon finding a recognizance to come up for judgment, and there was, therefore, no case to go to the jury. It was, however, held by the Court of Crown Cases Reserved that the word \"convicted\" in ss. 9 and 12 meant \"found guilty\" and that the sentence was to follow on the conviction. It was also held that a plea of guilty would equally be a conviction. In my view, the statute in question in the case at bar is to be similarly construed. \"Convicted\" in s. 21 means \"found guilty\" and a plea of guilty is equally a conviction. The judgment pronounced upon that plea being quite irrelevant, the only question, therefore, is as to proof of the plea.\nI agree with the contention of the appellant that neither s. 982 of the Criminal Code nor s. 12 of The Canada Evidence Act are relevant but that the relevant provision is to be found in s. 23 of the latter statute, which provides that:\nEvidence of any proceeding or record whatsoever of, in or before any court in \u2026 any province of Canada \u2026 may be made in any action or proceeding by an exemplification or certified copy thereof, purporting to be under the seal of such court \u2026\nIn my view, \"proceeding\" as first used in the section is used in the sense of \"step\", and the section has been so construed; Rex v. Kobold 9; U.S.A. v. Watson 10.\nComing to Exhibit \"B\", there can be no doubt that the fifth count there set out is a copy of the actual charge. In my opinion, in going on to certify as to Riley that\nOn being arraigned on CHARGE NUMBER FIVE (HEREINBEFORE SET OUT) before His Honour Judge Legris on the twenty-first day of February, in the year 1952, he PLEADED GUILTY THEREOF AS CHARGED,\nthe exhibit is within the section. Its effect is to certify that the plea entered to the charge was \"guilty as charged\".\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nLocke, J. (dissenting in part) :\u2014It is conceded on behalf of the appellant that The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929 is in pith and substance criminal law, within the meaning of that expression in s-s. 27 of s. 91 of the British North America Act, but it is contended that the provision of s. 21 authorizing the forfeiture of a motor car used in any manner in connection with the commission of an offence against s. 4 is not \"necessarily incidental to make such legislation effective\", to adopt the language of the appellant's factum. Thus, while the jurisdiction of Parliament to declare that the sale of narcotic drugs is a crime is not disputed, we are asked to say that one of the penalties provided for the commission of such an offence is not really necessary for the effective prevention and punishment of the crime. The admission as to the true nature of the statute is, in my opinion, fatal to this contention. It is for Parliament and not for the courts to decide the nature of the punishment which may be imposed for a breach of the prohibitions contained in s-s. 1 of s. 4. While, in my opinion, it is really aside from the point, the provision for the forfeiture is an added punishment to the offender, whether the vehicle be owned by him or by some other person who, as in the present case, is entirely free of any complicity in the matter.\nIn the latter case, it can scarcely be suggested that it would be an answer to a demand by the owner upon the offender for the return of his motor car that it had been taken from his possession by the Crown and became forfeited under the provisions of s. 21. I am quite unable to understand how, in these circumstances, it can be said that the Court has any jurisdiction whatever in the matter. The fact that the present appellant, the owner of the car in question, knew nothing of the use to which its property was being put by Riley is the basis for the claim that the forfeiture of its property is an interference with its property and civil rights and thus trenches upon the jurisdiction of the Province. On this aspect of the matter, it appears to me to be sufficient to refer to the language of Lord Atkin, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. A.G. for Canada 11:\u2014\nIf then the legislation in question is authorized under one or other of the heads specifically enumerated in s. 91, it is not to the purpose to say that it affects property and civil rights in the Provinces. Most of the specific subjects in s. 91 do affect property and civil rights but so far as the legislation of Parliament in pith and substance is operating within the enumerated powers there is constitutional authority to interfere with property and civil rights.\nThese proceedings were initiated by a petition of right and the case advanced by the appellant is that it was the owner of the motor vehicle as the assignee of the conditional sale contract signed by one Ciampi as purchaser, that the Crown claimed that the motor vehicle had been forfeited under s. 21 of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929 and retained possession of it. The prayer for relief asked a declaration that the suppliant is the owner of the vehicle, or alternatively damages. The respondent by the amended statement of defence justifies the retention of the vehicle on the ground that it had been used in connection with the sale of a narcotic drug by one Patrick Charles Riley, contrary to the provisions of the Act, and alleged that Riley had been convicted of that offence at Windsor on February 21, 1952. These allegations were put in issue by the reply.\nAt the trial the suppliant proved its ownership of the motor vehicle. The record is silent as to how it came to be in the possession of Riley at the time the offence was committed. At the conclusion of the suppliant's case, the respondent gave evidence as to the circumstances under which the vehicle had been seized. It appears that Constable La Brash of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had purchased heroin from Riley at a time when the latter was driving the car in question, which was thus, on his conviction, forfeited to the Crown under the provisions of s. 21 of the Act. It was an essential part of the Crown's case to prove that Riley had been convicted of an offence against the Act. As proof of this fact, counsel for the Crown tendered a document purporting to be signed by Margaret L. Whelan, beneath whose signature there appeared the words \"Deputy Clerk C.C.C.E.\" and to which the seal of the County Court of the County of Essex was affixed. By this document the Deputy Clerk certified, inter alia, that Patrick Charles Riley had been committed to gaol for trial and was on bail awaiting trial on the charge, inter alia, of having on the 16th day of June 1951, at the City of Windsor in the County of Essex, unlawfully sold a drug, to wit, diacetylmorphine, to one Charles J. K. La Brash, without first obtaining a licence from the Minister or without other lawful authority, contrary to s. 4(1) (f) of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929 and amendments thereto, that he had appeared before His Honour Judge Legris, a judge of the County Court of the County of Essex on November 15, 1951, and elected for trial by a judge without the intervention of a jury, and that thereafter, on being arraigned on this charge before the said judge, he pleaded guilty and was thereupon sentenced by His Honour Judge Legris on the said charge to:\u2014\nsix months, plus a fine of $200.00, or in default of payment of said fine an additional three months: the same to run concurrently with any other sentence imposed on the said date by His Honour Judge Legris. On the reverse side of the second page of this document there appeared a notation signed by the County Court Judge finding that the automobile in question in the proceedings was used in the commission of the offence above mentioned.\nBefore considering the effect of what took place when this document was tendered as proof of the fact of the conviction, the admissibility of the document as proof of its contents is to be considered. S. 982 of the Criminal Code, which permits the use of a certificate signed by the Clerk of the Court or other officer having the custody of the records, containing the substance and effect only of any previous indictment and conviction for any indictable offence or a copy of any summary conviction as proof of such prior conviction, provides a means whereby in criminal proceedings such as those of the nature referred to in ss. 963 and 964 of the Code a previous conviction may be proven. The section, however, has no application in civil proceedings. S. 12 of the Canada Evidence Act provides a manner by which a conviction may be proved in cases where a witness has been questioned as to whether he has been convicted of any offence and either denies the fact or refuses to answer, but this can have no application to the present matter. S. 23 of the Canada Evidence Act permits evidence of any proceeding or record in any court in Canada being made by \"an exemplification or certified copy thereof\" purporting to be under the seal of such court. But this equally is without application. The word \"exemplification\" has a well defined legal meaning, being an attested copy or transcript of a record. The document tendered, however, on its face did not purport to be an exemplification or copy of any record but merely stated a series of facts. Presumably when the prisoner pleaded guilty, a record was prepared by the prosecuting officer, as required by s-s. 5 of s. 827 of the Code, and a record in Form 60 signed by the Judge. An exemplification of that document would clearly have been admissible and would have proved the conviction. The document tendered and received in evidence was, however, in my opinion, inadmissible as proof of any fact. Constable La Brash gave evidence that he was present when Riley pleaded guilty and was sentenced by His Honour Judge Legris but this evidence was clearly inadmissible as proof of the conviction (R. v. Smith 12; Reg. v. Bourdon 13 ; Hartley v. Hindmarsh 14 (a civil action) ; Mash v. Darley 15).\nThere remains the question as to the effect of what took place before the learned trial Judge when the so-called certificate was tendered. Counsel appearing for the suppliant at the trial, having first objected to the oral evidence as proof of the conviction, was asked by the learned trial Judge if he was objecting to proof by admission of a certified copy of the conviction. It is, however, to be noted' that this is not what the document purported to be. In reply, counsel said:\u2014\nI am not objecting to my friend putting in the certificate for what it is worth; I am not admitting that it constitutes proof of the conviction.\nThe document was then marked as an exhibit, whereupon counsel again said that he wanted to make it clear to counsel for the Crown that he was not \"admitting his introduction of the certificate as proof of the conviction\" and did not want it to be said that he had misled him into believing that he had done so, and that:\u2014\nI do not want my friend to place any reliance on the certificate which he is putting in, based on any apparent compliance on my part.\nto which counsel for the Crown is reported to have said:\u2014\nI am not placing the utmost reliance on it as proof of the conviction. In the meantime I submit it.\nFollowing this, the learned trial Judge said to counsel for the suppliant that he understood that he was not objecting to the certificate going in but that he was not admitting that the admission of the certificate proved the conviction of the person, to which counsel replied:\u2014\nI am saying, my lord, that under s. 24 of the Evidence Act, since this document purports to be certified by the clerk of the court that it is admissible for what it is worth. I do not go any further than that.\nThe reason for the reference to s. 24 of the Evidence Act is not clear since the document tendered did not purport, as I have said, to be a copy of any record. Counsel for the respondent has contended before us that the admissibility of the document was not objected to and that, accordingly, it should be received as proof of its contents. I am unable to accept this contention. The passages above quoted make it abundantly clear that counsel for the suppliant objected to the document being accepted as proof of the conviction. If the matter were, however, to be considered on the footing that document had been admitted without objection, since it was, in my opinion, clearly inadmissible as proof of any fact, we should in this Court disregard it. In Jacker v. International Cable Company 16, on an appeal from Hawkins, J., it appeared that a document admitted in evidence at the trial was wrongly admitted and that no objection had been taken to its admission. The Court consisting of Lord Esher, M.R., Fry, L.J. and Lopes, L.J., were unanimously of the opinion that the evidence should be disregarded. In delivering judgment, the Master of the Rolls said in part that if counsel did not object to the admission of the document at the trial it was the duty of the Judge to reject it when he came to give his judgment and that the Court of Appeal would do so or, if it were objected to and admitted the Court was bound to reject it, their duty being to arrive at a decision upon legal evidence. Lopes, L.J. said that in cases where evidence was improperly admitted before a Judge without a jury it was the duty of the Court of Appeal to disregard it, though it had been received without objection. This case, it may be noted, is cited as authority for the proposition stated in the 9th Edition of Phipson on Evidence at p. 711 and in Taylor on Evidence, 12th Edition, p. 1161.\nI am unable, with respect for contrary opinion, to see anything in the record in this case to support a contention that counsel for the suppliant consented, as of course he might, to the fact of the conviction being proved in this manner. I find nothing in the record to support any such contention, indeed the statements made by counsel for the suppliant were to the direct contrary.\nI would allow this appeal and set aside the judgment at the trial and direct that judgment be entered declaring that the suppliant was entitled to the possession of the motor vehicle in question, as against the Crown, at the time of the commencement of the proceedings and that, if such vehicle is not in the possession of the Crown, there be a reference to the Registrar of the Exchequer Court to determine its value at the time of seizure, the appellant to have judgment for the amount so found, together with the costs of the trial, the reference and of this appeal.\nThe judgment of Estey and Cartwright, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nCartwright J.:\u2014For the reasons given by my brother Rand I agree with his conclusion that s. 21 of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act is intra vires of Parliament as being an integral part of the Criminal Law. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the authorities dealing with the circumstances in which Parliament may deal with matters which, though otherwise within the legislative competence of the provincial legislatures, are necessarily incidental to effective legislation by Parliament upon a subject of legislation expressly enumerated in s. 91 of the British North America Act.\nIt remains to consider the appellants' argument that the facts necessary to justify a forfeiture under s. 21 were not proved at the trial. The appeal was argued, and I think rightly so, on the assumption that, on the state of the pleadings, the appellant having proved its ownership of the automobile and that the respondent had taken possession of it and refused to give it up, the onus rested upon the respondent to prove (i) that a person had been convicted of an offence against The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, and (ii) that the automobile had contained the drug in respect of which such offence was committed or had been used in some manner in connection with such offence.\nThe case for the respondent as pleaded was that one Patrick Charles Reilly of the City of Windsor, was on the 21st day of February, 1952, at Windsor, Ontario, convicted of having illegally sold a narcotic drug contrary to s. 4(1) (f) of the Act, and that the automobile in question was proved to have contained the narcotic drug or to have been used, and did in fact contain the narcotic drug and was in fact used, in connection with the said offence for which the said Patrick Charles Reilly was so convicted, whereby the said automobile became forfeited to Her Majesty under the provisions of Section 21 of the Act.\nThe evidence at the trial related to an offence committed by Patrick Charles Riley but it is clear that he was one and the same person as that intended to be described by the words in the Statement of Defence \"Patrick Charles Reilly\", and if necessary leave to amend the Statement of Defence by striking out the word \"Reilly\" wherever it occurs and substituting the word \"Riley\" should now be given.\nThe more serious and difficult question is whether the evidence of the conviction was legally admissible and sufficient.\nTo prove the conviction counsel for the respondent at the trial filed as Exhibit \"B\" a certificate which so far as relevant reads as follows:\u2014\n(Crest)\nIn the County Court Judges' Criminal Court\nof the County of Essex\nThe King against Patrick Charles Riley. This is to certify that Patrick Charles Riley, who was committed to Gaol for trial and who was on bail awaiting trial,\n1 \u2026\n2 \u2026\n3 \u2026\n4 \u2026\nAnd 5: FURTHER FOR THAT HE, on or about the 16th day of June, 1951, at the city of Windsor, in the county of Essex, did unlawfully sell a drug, to wit, Diacetylmorphine, to one Charles J. K. Labrash, without first obtaining a license from the Minister, or without other lawful authority, contrary to Section 4(1) (f) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, and amendments thereto,\n6 \u2026\nappeared before His Honour Joseph A. Legris, Esquire, a Judge of the County Court of the County of Essex, on the fifteenth day of November, in the year 1951, and elected trial by a Judge without the intervention of a Jury.\nOn being ararigned on CHARGE NUMBER FIVE (HEREINBEFORE SET OUT) before His Honour Judge Legris on the twenty-first day of February, in the year 1952, he PLEADED GUILTY THEREOF AS CHARGED.\nHe was thereupon on the said twenty-first day of February, in the year 1952, sentenced by His Honour Judge Legris on the said charge to SIX MONTHS PLUS A FINE OF $200, OR IN DEFAULT OF PAYMENT OF SAID FINE, AN ADDITIONAL THREE MONTHS: THE SAME TO RUN CONCURRENTLY WITH ANY OTHER SENTENCE IMPOSED ON THE SAID DATE BY HIS HONOUR JUDGE LEGRIS. IN WITNESS WHEREOF I have hereunto set my hand and affixed the seal of this said Court at the City of Windsor, in the County of Essex, this 21st day of February, 1952.\nMARGARET L. WHALEN,\n(This is a written signature),\nDeputy Clerk, C.C.C.E.\n[SEAL]\nPresiding Judge\nJ. A. LEGRIS,\n(This is typewritten).\nOn the back of the Certificate appears the following:\u2014\nI FIND THAT AUTOMOBILE BEARING 1951 ONTARIO LICENSE NUMBER 855R4 WAS USED IN THE COMMISSION OF THE WITHIN OFFENSE COUNT NUMBER FIVE (5).\nJOSEPH A. LEGRIS,\n(This is a written signature),\nJudge, County Court,\nCounty of Essex.\nHaving produced this certificate and read it, Mr. Bagwell, who was counsel for the respondent at the trial, asked the witness who was then in the box, Constable Labrash, who was the Charles J. K. Labrash mentioned in charge number 5 set out above, whether he was in Court when Riley pleaded guilty. The witness replied in the affirmative and the following discussion ensued:\u2014\nMR. ANDERSON (counsel for the appellant at the trial): My lord, may I at this juncture say, with respect, that as to proof of the conviction I take the position it cannot be proved by the evidence of anyone who was present, or upon the evidence as to anything they may have heard at the trial. I object to any question directed to that end.\nHIS LORDSHIP: You are not objecting to proof by admission of a certified copy of the conviction?\nMR. ANDERSON: I am not objecting to my friend putting in the certificate for what it is worth; I am not admitting that it constitutes proof of the conviction.\nMR. BAGWELL: I put the certificate in as proof of the conviction. I think it is well established.\nHIS LORDSHIP: The certificate of conviction will foe Exhibit No. B.\nEXHIBIT NO. B.: Certificate of conviction of Patrick Charles Riley on 21st February 1952, on charge under S. 4(1) (f) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. Filed by respondent.\nMR. BAGWELL: And now, having proved the conviction, I intend to ask the constable to further substantiate it if he can; after having had the conviction read to him, and from sitting in court on the day when the conviction was made, can he identify Mr. Riley as the man convicted?\nMR. ANDERSON: Again, my lord, I do not want to interrupt unnecessarily but this is a crucial part of the Crown's case, and I want to make it clear to my friend that I am certainly not admitting his introduction of the certificate as proof of the conviction. And I do not want it subsequently to be said that I misled him into believing I did so. This is a judicial (sic) statute that is being enforced against us, and the strictest proof of the conviction is called for. I do not want my friend to place any reliance on the certificate which he is putting in, based on any apparent compliance on my part.\nMR. BAGWELL: I am not placing the utmost reliance on it as proof of the conviction. In the meantime, I submit it.\nHIS LORDSHIP: I understand that you are not objecting to the certificate going in but you are not admitting that the admission of the certificate establishes the conviction of the person for that offence.\nMR. ANDERSON: I am saying, my lord, that under sec. 24 of the Evidence Act, since this document purports to be certified by the clerk of the court that it is admissible for what it is worth. I do not go any further than that.\nHIS LORDSHIP: I will hear your argument later on.\nMR. BAGWELL: With your lordship's permission, I intend to ask the constable further if he was in court when the conviction was made.\nHIS LORDSHIP: I see no objection to him stating the fact he was there and heard the conviction.\nMR. BAGWELL: Q. Were you in court when the conviction was made?\u2014A. Yes, sir, I was.\nMR. ANDERSON: Again, my lord, is my objection clear, that this evidence cannot be directed to the conviction; I submit that it cannot be proved in that way.\nHIS LORDSHIP: It probably is not proof under the Evidence Act; he is merely stating that he was present at the time the conviction was rendered.\nThere is no doubt that the evidence of Labrash, and of other members of the R.C.M.P. who were also called, proved conclusively that the individual Riley who sold the drug to Labrash at Windsor on June 16 1951 in the automobile in question and the individual Riley who, on February 21 1952, was arraigned before His Honour Judge Legris on charge number 5, above set out, pleaded guilty thereto and was sentenced, were one and the same person. The admissibility of this evidence to prove this identity could not be questioned. The case for the appellant is that, under the authorities, neither the evidence of these witnesses nor the certificate Exhibit \"B\" was legal proof of the conviction.\nThe statements in Phipson on Evidence, 9th Edition, at pages 582 and 583, that the conviction of any person charged with an indictable offence must, at common law, have been proved by production of the record or an examined copy thereof and cannot, where the record is in existence, be proved by the oral evidence of a witness who merely heard it pronounced, are supported by the authorities to which the learned author refers. I think, therefore, that the appellant's point is well taken that while the evidence of the witnesses Labrash, Bearesdorfer, McIver and Ramsay was admissible to prove identity it would not serve, if objected to, as evidence of the conviction. To hold otherwise, in the words of Lord Tenterden C.J. in The King v. Smith 17, \"would be to break through the established rules of evidence, which is always a dangerous course.\" I am, however, of opinion that in the particular circumstances of this case the conviction was sufficiently proved by the certificate, Exhibit \"B\", referred to above. This certificate appears to have been drawn up pursuant to the provisions of s. 982 of the Criminal Code or s. 12(2) of The Canada Evidence Act and would have been admissible as proof of the conviction in any proceedings to which either of those sections was applicable. I incline however to agree with Mr. Parkinson's submission that neither of such sections applied and that the proper method of proof was by the production of an exemplification or certified copy of the record of conviction pursuant to s. 23 of The Canada Evidence Act. Strictly speaking, Exhibit \"B\" is neither an exemplification nor a certified copy of such record. The record of conviction was presumably drawn up in accordance with Form 60 as required by s. 827(5) of the Code. Exhibit \"B\" appears to me to contain all the essential matter which would be set out in a record of conviction such as is prescribed in Form 60. It commences by setting out that Patrick Charles Riley was committed to jail. It sets out the very words of all the offences with which he was charged. It sets out that he appeared before the judge and elected trial by a judge without the intervention of a jury, that he pleaded guilty, and that he was sentenced. The sentence is set out in full. It is certified under the hand of the Deputy Clerk and under the seal of the Court, which is a court of record. On the back of the sheet of the certificate to which the seal of the court is affixed is the signature of the judge. There is no doubt as to the authenticity of the document and, as already observed, it fulfills all the requirements of s. 982 of the Criminal Code and of s. 12(2) of The Canada Evidence Act and would be proof of the conviction in proceedings of a character even more serious than those in the case at bar. In civil cases the rules of evidence may always be relaxed by the consent of parties. As appears from the extract from the proceedings at the trial, set out above, counsel then appearing for the appellant (while making clear his position that the certificate did not prove the conviction) did not contest its admissibility. Had he done so, on the ground now urged that it did not strictly comply with s. 23 of The Canada Evidence Act, the learned trial judge might well have excluded it but in that case he would doubtless have allowed an adjournment to permit the obtaining of a copy of the record certified as is contemplated by s. 23. In my opinion effect should not be given to this objection.\nOne further point remains for consideration. It is submitted for the appellant that a person who has pleaded guilty to a charge of an offence under the Act and has been sentenced following such plea has not been \"convicted of an offence\" within the meaning of those words as used in s. 21. In my opinion this argument must be rejected. The cases of The Queen v. Blaby 18 and The King v. Meehan 19, appear to me to be conclusive against it.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Parkinson, Gardiner, Willis and Roberts.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

His right is limited to demanding trial by a jury skilled in whichever of the two official languages of the Province is the language habitually spoken by him. (Cartwright J., being of the view that this Court had no jurisdiction, expressed no opinion upon the question).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming, Bissonnette and Casey JJ.A. dissenting, the appellant's conviction on a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of an automobile.\nLucien Gagnon for the appellant.\nGeorges Sylvestre Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nFauteux J.:\u2014Accus\u00e9, dans le district de Joliette, province de Qu\u00e9bec, d'y avoir commis l'offense d'homicide involontaire, l'appelant\u2014dont la langue maternelle est l'italien et qui parle aussi le fran\u00e7ais et l'anglais couramment, depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es,\u2014demanda, lors de la mise en accusation d'\u00eatre jug\u00e9 par un jury de langue anglaise. A cette requ\u00eate, la Couronne fit objection et \u00e0 la suite d'une enqu\u00eate ordonn\u00e9e et tenue pour d\u00e9terminer la langue parl\u00e9e par l'accus\u00e9, la demande fut rejet\u00e9e et la cause s'instruisit devant un jury de langue fran\u00e7aise. Trouv\u00e9 coupable, Piperno porta la cause en appel 2, invoquant plusieurs moyens qui tous, sauf un, furent unanimement rejet\u00e9s. Seul le grief \"qu'il avait droit \u00e0 un jury anglais\" donna lieu \u00e0 une dissidence. La majorit\u00e9 des Juges concluant qu'en fait, le fran\u00e7ais \u00e9tait la langue habituellement parl\u00e9e par l'accus\u00e9 depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, d\u00e9clara le grief mal fond\u00e9 et, comme cons\u00e9quence, l'appel fut rejet\u00e9. Les dissidents adopt\u00e8rent sur le point une vue contraire avec, \u00e9videmment, une conclusion diff\u00e9rente quant au r\u00e9sultat.\nPiperno invoque maintenant cette dissidence et les dispositions de l'article 1023 du Code Criminel pour en appeler devant cette Cour.\nAssumant que nous ayons juridiction, je n'h\u00e9siterais pas, vu l'opinion majoritaire et finale de la Cour d'Appel sur la question de fait, \u00e0 rejeter comme elle ce pourvoi. Car je ne crois pas que la loi ou l'interpr\u00e9tation qu'on en a fait jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, donnent \u00e0 un accus\u00e9 qui demande \u00e0 \u00eatre jug\u00e9 par un jury compos\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement de jur\u00e9s parlant la langue fran\u00e7aise ou par un jury compos\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement de jur\u00e9s parlant la langue anglaise, un droit absolu de r\u00e9ussir sur cette demande, ou d'obtenir, \u00e0 tout le moins, d'\u00eatre jug\u00e9 par un jury mixte, i.e., par un jury compos\u00e9 d'au moins six personnes vers\u00e9es dans la langue de l'accus\u00e9.\nLa loi. Il convient de reproduire les dispositions des articles 923 et 924 du Code Criminel,\u2014dispositions d'exception, respectivement applicables dans les provinces de Qu\u00e9bec et du Manitoba,\u2014 et aussi celles de l'article 937 lequel, r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 ces deux dispositions sp\u00e9ciales, les interpr\u00e8te et en donne ainsi la v\u00e9ritable port\u00e9e:\u2014\n923. Dans ceux des districts de la province de Qu\u00e9bec o\u00f9 le sh\u00e9rif est tenu par la loi de dresser une liste de petits jur\u00e9s compos\u00e9e moiti\u00e9 de personnes parlant la langue anglaise, et moiti\u00e9 de personnes parlant la langue fran\u00e7aise, il doit, dans son rapport, mentionner s\u00e9par\u00e9ment les jur\u00e9s qu'il d\u00e9signe comme parlant la langue anglaise, et ceux qu'il d\u00e9signe comme parlant la langue fran\u00e7aise, respectivement; et les noms des jur\u00e9s ainsi assign\u00e9s sont appel\u00e9s alternativement d'apr\u00e8s ces listes.\n2. Dans tout district, le prisonnier peut, lorsqu'il est mis en jugement, demander par motion, d'\u00eatre jug\u00e9 par un jury enti\u00e8rement compos\u00e9 de jur\u00e9s parlant la langue anglaise, ou enti\u00e8rement compos\u00e9 de jur\u00e9s parlant la langue fran\u00e7aise.\n3. Sur pr\u00e9sentation de cette motion, le juge peut ordonner au sh\u00e9rif d'assigner un nombre suffisant de jur\u00e9s parlant la langue anglaise ou la langue fran\u00e7aise, \u00e0 moins qu'\u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion il n'apparaisse que les fins de la justice sont mieux servies par la composition d'un jury mixte. S.R., c. 146, art. 923; 1925, c. 38, art. 23. 924. Lorsqu'une personne mise en jugement devant la Cour du banc du Roi pour le Manitoba demande un jury compos\u00e9 de moiti\u00e9 au moins de personnes vers\u00e9es dans la langue de la d\u00e9fense, si c'est la langue anglaise ou la langue fran\u00e7aise, elle est jug\u00e9e par un jury compos\u00e9; de moiti\u00e9 au moins, des personnes dont les noms se trouvent les premiers \u00e0 la suite les uns des autres sur la liste g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des jur\u00e9s, et qui, comparaissant et n'\u00e9tant point l\u00e9galement r\u00e9cus\u00e9es, sont, de l'avis de la cour, trouv\u00e9es vers\u00e9es dans la langue de la d\u00e9fense.\n2. Lorsque par suite du nombre de r\u00e9cusations ou pour toute autre cause, le nombre des personnes vers\u00e9es dans la langue de la d\u00e9fense est insuffisant, la cour remet le proc\u00e8s \u00e0 un autre jour, et le sh\u00e9rif suppl\u00e9e \u00e0 l'insuffisance en assignant pour le jour ainsi fix\u00e9 tel nombre suppl\u00e9mentaire que la cour ordonne de jur\u00e9s vers\u00e9s dans la langue de la d\u00e9fense et dont les noms se trouvent inscrits apr\u00e8s les premiers, \u00e0 la suite les uns des autres, sur la liste des petits jur\u00e9s. S.R., c. 146, art. 924.\n937. Lorsqu'une personne accus\u00e9e d'une infraction qui lui donnerait droit \u00e0 vingt ou \u00e0 douze r\u00e9cusations p\u00e9remptoires comme susdit, demande \u00e0 subir son proc\u00e8s devant un jury compos\u00e9 pour moiti\u00e9 de personnes vers\u00e9es dans la langue de la d\u00e9fense, en vertu des articles neuf cent vingt-trois ou neuf cent vingt-quatre, le nombre de r\u00e9cusations p\u00e9remptoires auquel elle a droit doit \u00eatre partag\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re qu'elle n'ait le droit de r\u00e9cuser p\u00e9remptoirement que la moiti\u00e9 de ce nombre parmi les jur\u00e9s de langue anglaise, et la moiti\u00e9 parmi les jur\u00e9s de langue fran\u00e7aise, S.R., c. 146, art. 937.\nNotons d'abord, incidemment, que dans ces trois articles d'exception, il n'est pas question de la nationalit\u00e9, des origines, traditions ou mentalit\u00e9 des jur\u00e9s ou de l'accus\u00e9. Seule la question de langue est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e.\nDisons ensuite que suivant ces articles 923 et 924, il est permis, dans les provinces de Qu\u00e9bec et du Manitoba respectivement, \u00e0 un accus\u00e9 de faire un choix de jur\u00e9s en tenant compte de la langue qu'ils parlent. Mais alors que l'article 924 indique manifestement que cette facult\u00e9 donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'accus\u00e9 se fonde et se conditionne sur la similitude entre sa langue et celle famili\u00e8re aux jur\u00e9s qu'il r\u00e9clame, au contraire, l'article 923, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 isol\u00e9ment, n'indique pas cette raison et ne pose pas cette condition. Au premier abord, le droit donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'accus\u00e9 par ce dernier article para\u00eet donc absolu. On ne voit pas le pourquoi de cette diff\u00e9rence. Et on s'expliquerait encore moins les dispositions de l'article 937, o\u00f9 ces deux articles 923 et 924 re\u00e7oivent, sur le point, une seule et m\u00eame interpr\u00e9tation,\u2014interpr\u00e9tation d'ordre l\u00e9gislatif,\u2014n'\u00e9tait-ce la disposition suivante d'une loi d'avant la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration, demeur\u00e9e en vigueur dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec et qui, encore plus explicitement que l'article 937 du Code, manifeste l'inexistence de cette diff\u00e9rence:\u2014\nSi le pr\u00e9venu, lors de sa mise en accusation, demande un jury compos\u00e9, pour une moiti\u00e9 au moins, de personnes parlant la langue de sa d\u00e9fense, si cette langue est le fran\u00e7ais ou l'anglais, il sera jug\u00e9 par un jury compos\u00e9 pour moiti\u00e9 au moins des personnes dont les noms se trouvent successivement les premiers sur le tableau et qui lors de leur comparution n'\u00e9tant pas l\u00e9galement r\u00e9cus\u00e9es seront, d'ap\u00e8s l'opinion de la cour, vers\u00e9es dans la langue du pr\u00e9venu; (27-28 Viet. cap. 41, art. 7, para. 2).\nCe qui est sanctionn\u00e9 par la loi, c'est une facult\u00e9 donn\u00e9e \u00e0 un pr\u00e9venu, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, de demander \u00e0 \u00eatre jug\u00e9 par des jur\u00e9s familiers avec la langue qu'il parle lui-m\u00eame\u2014pourvu que ce soit le fran\u00e7ais ou l'anglais\u2014et le droit d'obtenir alors au moins un jury mixte si, dans la discr\u00e9tion du Juge, il appara\u00eet que les fins de la Justice soient ainsi mieux servies qu'en faisant droit \u00e0 sa demande. L'objet \u00e9vident de ces dispositions assurant \u00e0 l'accus\u00e9, s'il le requiert, l'instruction de son proc\u00e8s devant douze ou au moins six jur\u00e9s vers\u00e9s dans sa langue, est qu'il puisse facilement en suivre le cours et, alors, exercer plus ad\u00e9quatement ses droits. En somme, le droit d'un accus\u00e9 de choisir un jury enti\u00e8rement compos\u00e9 de jur\u00e9s parlant la langue fran\u00e7aise ou enti\u00e8rement compos\u00e9 de jur\u00e9s parlant la langue anglaise n'est pas, en ce sens, un droit absolu; et le droit d'obtenir alors un jury mixte\u2014\u00e9tant lui-m\u00eame, suivant l'article 923, un droit d\u00e9pendant de l'existence du droit de choisir un jury enti\u00e8rement compos\u00e9 de jur\u00e9s de langue fran\u00e7aise ou un jury enti\u00e8rement compos\u00e9 de jur\u00e9s de langue anglaise\u2014n'est lui-m\u00eame absolu qu'en tant qu'un choix entre deux tels corps de jur\u00e9s soit d'abord autoris\u00e9 par la loi. Disons, enfin, qu'il va de soi qu'un accus\u00e9 qui proc\u00e8de \u00e0 cette demande peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 justifier du droit de ce faire et qu'il appartient alors au tribunal d'adjuger sur la mati\u00e8re. Dans le cas o\u00f9 l'accus\u00e9 ne parle qu'une des deux langues officielles et dans le cas o\u00f9, parlant les deux, il est plus familier avec l'une qu' avec l'autre, il est dans les conditions pour exercer la facult\u00e9 qui lui est reconnue par cet article. Mais, dans l'hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 ces deux langues lui seraient \u00e9galement famili\u00e8res, les dispositions de la loi n'ayant plus d'objet ne sauraient s'appliquer car, alors, qu'un seul, que plusieurs ou que m\u00eame les douze jur\u00e9s soient vers\u00e9s dans la langue fran\u00e7aise ou dans la langue anglaise, ou dans les deux, dans tous les cas, le corps du jury est vers\u00e9 dans une langue famili\u00e8re \u00e0 l'accus\u00e9. La jurisprudence. Je crois que c'est la premi\u00e8re fois que cette Cour est appel\u00e9e \u00e0 rendre un jugement sur le point; mais les d\u00e9cisions que la Cour d'Appel de la province de Qu\u00e9bec a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 rendre sur la question s'accordent, en substance, avec l'interpr\u00e9tation et les conclusions r\u00e9sultant de cette analyse de la loi. Il suffit, je crois, d'en donner la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Alexander v. Regem 3; Bureau v. Le Roi 4 ; Gouin v. Regem 5 ; Duval v. Le Roi 6 ; Lacasse v. Le Roi 7.\nPour ces motifs, je renverrais l'appel.\nCartwright J.:\u2014The appellant was convicted on a charge of manslaughter, arising out of the death of one Denis Deslongchamps caused, as was charged, by the negligent operation of an automobile by the appellant. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) 8 the conviction was affirmed by a majority judgment. Bissonnette and Casey JJ., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal and directed a new trial.\nSpecial leave to appeal was not sought and our jurisdiction is therefore restricted to a consideration of the point or points of law on which the learned judges mentioned above differed from the majority of the Court.\nOn the argument before us questions were touched on as to the true construction of section 923 of the Criminal Code some of which appear to me, on further consideration, not to be raised in the dissenting judgments. In particular I think we are not at liberty to consider whether that section gives to an accused in the Province of Quebec who moves upon arraignment that he be tried by a jury entirely composed of jurors speaking the English language or entirely composed of jurors speaking the French language an absolute right to be either tried accordingly or tried by a mixed jury, and I wish to make it clear that I am expressing no opinion upon that question.\nAs I read the judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench in this case, all the learned judges are in agreement that the right given to an accused by subsection (2) of section 923 is limited to demanding trial by a jury entirely composed of jurors speaking whichever of the two official languages of the Province of Quebec is the language habitually spoken by the accused.\nThe learned Chief Justice deals with the question as follows:\u2014\nD'apr\u00e8s certaines d\u00e9cisions, en particulier celle de Alexander v. Le Roi (1930) 49 B.R. 215, la demande pour un jury de medietate linguae est comprise ou incluse dans celle d'un jury enti\u00e8rement compos\u00e9 de jur\u00e9s parlant la m\u00eame langue (anglaise ou fran\u00e7aise), et le juge qui dans sa discr\u00e9tion peut refuser la requ\u00eate pour la formation d'un jury enti\u00e8rement compos\u00e9 de jur\u00e9s parlant un seul et m\u00eame langage (anglais ou fran\u00e7ais), devait donner en l'esp\u00e8ce un jury mixte s'il en arrivait \u00e0 la conclusion que la langue habituelle de l'accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait l'anglais.\nEn autant qu'il s'agit d'un jury mixte, il y a lieu de retenir que la loi ne se place aucunement au point de vue de l'origine ou de l'ascendance de l'accus\u00e9, de l'endroit de sa naissance, du milieu dans lequel il a v\u00e9cu, de la religion \u00e0 laquelle il appartient. Et il en est de m\u00eame en ce qui concerne le jury.\nTout ce que l'accus\u00e9, sujet britannique, a droit d'obtenir, c'est que six des jur\u00e9s soient vers\u00e9s 'skilled in' dans la langue fran\u00e7aise, six dans la langue anglaise; pour l'accus\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame, son droit lui viendra de ce qu'il parle habituellement une des deux langues reconnues au pays, la langue fran\u00e7aise ou la langue anglaise.\nSt. Jacques J. agrees with the Chief Justice and says in part:\u2014\n\u2026 L'enqu\u00eate qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 ce sujet le d\u00e9montre d'une fa\u00e7on satisfaisante, et le juge n'a pas err\u00e9 en permettant que l'enqu\u00eate soit faite devant un jury de langue fran\u00e7aise, car on peut dire que c'est la langue habituelle que parle l'inculp\u00e9.\nPratte J. who also agrees with the Chief Justice says in part:\u2014\nSi la langue maternelle de Piperno \u00e9tait l'anglais, je dirais qu'il a droit \u00e0 un jury mixte, nonobstant le fait que, depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, les circonstances ont requis qu'il parl\u00e2t le fran\u00e7ais plut\u00f4t que l'anglais. Mais tel n'est pas le cas. La langue maternelle de Piperno est l'italien. D\u00e8s son jeune \u00e2ge il a appris l'anglais et le fran\u00e7ais. A son foyer, il parle les deux langues. Mais en dehors de chez lui il parle surtout le fran\u00e7ais depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, et il ne para\u00eet pas, au t\u00e9moignage qu'il a rendu \u00e0 l'appui de sa demande, que l'anglais lui serait plus facile \u00e0 parler ou \u00e0 comprendre que le fran\u00e7ais. Dans ces conditions, sa seule affirmation que sa langue habituelle est l'anglais ne me para\u00eet pas suffisante pour lui donner le droit d'exiger un jury anglais ou un jury mixte.\nTurning then to the dissenting judgments, Bissonette J. opens his judgment with the words:\u2014\nJe partage enti\u00e8rement l'opinion de monsieur le juge Casey. Casey J. says in part:\u2014\nThe decisions then subsequent to the Alexander case have no bearing on the problem presented in the case at Bar, and we are left with the rule that the accused has the right to demand that he be tried by a jury composed exclusively of jurors speaking his language, and if this request is refused by the trial judge, the latter is bound to order the impanelling of a mixed jury. The next step is to determine what is the language of the defence and the test is given by Mr. Justice Rivard in the Alexander case. At page 219 he says:\u2014\n'Ainsi qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit dans la cause de Yancey, the language of the defence, c'est la langue, anglaise ou fran\u00e7aise, habituellement parl\u00e9e par l'accus\u00e9.'\nIf I have understood their reasons correctly the question to which all the learned judges directed their minds and on which they differed was whether on the evidence the learned judge who presided at the trial was right in holding that French was and English was not \"la langue habituellement parl\u00e9e par l'accus\u00e9.\" It is not questioned that the appellant's mother-tongue was Italian and that he speaks both French and English fluently. In such circumstances the question which of the last mentioned languages is that habitually spoken by the appellant appears to me to be one of fact or of mixed fact and law and therefore one into which we can not inquire.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L. Gagnon.\nSolicitor for the respondent: G. Sylvestre.\n1 Q.R. [1953] Q.B. 80.\n2 Q.R. [1953] Q.B. 80.\n3 Q.R. (1930) 49 K.B. 215.\n4 Q.R. (1931) 52 K.B. 15.\n5 Q.R. (1937) 43 L.R. N.S.) 149.\n6 Q.R.

In this Court the appellant declined to contend that the by-law was invalid because a discretion was delegated to the Chief of Police.\nHeld: (reversing the decision appealed from), that the by-law did not extend so as to prohibit the appellant as a member of Jehovah's Witnesses from distributing in the streets of the City any of the writings included in the exhibits and that the City, its officers and agents be restrained from in any way interfering with such distribution.\nPer Kerwin J.:\u2014Whether or not the Freedom of Worship Act whenever originally enacted (it is now R.S.Q. 1941, c. 307) be taken to super\u00adsede the pre-Confederation Statute of 1852 (14-15 Vict., c. 175), the specific terms of the enactment providing for freedom of worship have not been abrogated. Even though it would appear from the evidence that Jehovah's Witnesses do not consider themselves as belonging to a religion, they are entitled to \"the free exercise and enjoyment of (their) Religious Profession ,and Worship\" and have a legal right to attempt to spread their views by way of the printed and written word as well as orally; and their attacks on religion generally, and one in particular, as shown in the exhibits filed, do not bring them within the exception \"so as the same be not made an excuse for licentious\u00adness or a justification of practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the Province\", and their attacks are not \"inconsistent with the peace and safety of the Province\" even when they are directed particularly against the religion of most of the Province's residents. As the by-law may have its effect in other cases and under other circumstances, if not otherwise objectionable, it is not ultra vires the City of Quebec, but since it is in conflict with the freedom of wor\u00adship of the appellant, it should be declared that it does not extend so as to prohibit the appellant as a member of Jehovah's Witnesses from distributing in the streets any of the writings included in the exhibits.\nFurthermore, since both the right to practise one's religion and the freedom of the press fall within \"Civil Rights in the Province\", the Legislature had the power to authorize the City to pass such by-law.\nPer Rand J.:\u2014Since the by-law is legislation in relation to religion and free speech and not in relation to the administration of the streets, and since freedom of worship and of the press are not civil rights or matters of a local or private nature in the Provinces, the subject-matter of the by-law was beyond the legislative power of the Province.\nPer Kellock J.:\u2014The by-law is ultra vires as it is not enacted in relation to streets but impinges upon freedom of religion and of the press which are not the subject-matter of legislative jurisdiction under s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act.\nPer Estey J.: Since the right to the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship is not a civil right in the province but is included among those upon which Parliament might legislate for the preservation of peace, order and good government, s. 2 of c. 307 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1941, could not be enacted by the province under any of the heads of s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act. By-law 184 is legislation in relation to and interferes with that right; it is therefore in conflict with the Statute of 1852 and authority for its enactment could not be given to the City by the Legislature. Even if s. 2 of c. 307 was intra vires, the by-law would be in conflict there\u2014with and, therefore, could not be competently passed by the City because it was not authorized by the terms of its charter.\nPer Locke J.:\u2014The belief of the Jehovah's Witnesses and their mode of worship fall within the meaning of the expression \"religious pro\u00adfession and worship\" in the preamble of the Statute of 1852 and in s. 2 of c. 307 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1941.\nThe true purpose and nature of the by-law is not to control the condition of the streets and traffic but to impose a censorship upon the dis\u00adtribution of written publications in the streets. The right to the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship without discrimination or preference, subject to the limitation expressed in the concluding words of the first paragraph of the Statute of 1852, is not a civil right of the nature referred to under head 13 of s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act, but is a constitutional right of all the people of the country given to them by the Statute of 1852 or implicit in the language of the preamble of the B.N.A. Act. The Province was not therefore empowered to authorize the passing of such a by-law restraining the appellant's right of freedom of worship.\nThe by-law further trenches upon the jurisdiction of Parliament under head 27 of s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act. It creates a new criminal offence and is ultra vires.\nPer Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau J. (dissenting) :\u2014The pith and substance of this general by-law is to control and regulate the usage of streets in regard to the distribution of pamphlets. Even if the motive of the City was to prevent the Jehovah's Witnesses from distributing their literature in the streets, that could never be a reason to render the by-law illegal or unconstitutional, since the City had the power to pass it: usage of the streets of a municipality being indisputably a question within the domain of the municipality and a local question.\nFreedom of worship is not a subject of legislation within the jurisdiction of Parliament. It is a civil right within the provinces. The provisions of the by-law are not covered by the preamble to s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, nor have they the character of a criminal law. Furthermore, even if the right to distribute pamphlets was an act of worship, freedom of worship is not an absolute right but is subject to control by the province.\nPer Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. (dissenting) :\u2014It was within the com\u00adpetence of the Legislature to authorize the passing of this by-law under its power to legislate in relation to (1) the use of highways, since the legislative authority to permit, forbid or regulate their use for purposes other than that of passing and repassing belongs to the provinces; and (2) police regulations and the suppression of conditions likely to cause disorder, since it is within the competence of the Legislature to prohibit or regulate the distribution in the streets of written matter having a tendency to insult or annoy the recipients thereof with the possible result of giving rise to disorder, and perhaps violence, in. the streets. An Act of a provincial legislature in relation to matters assigned to it under the B.N.A. Act is not rendered invalid because it interferes to a limited extent with either the freedom of the press or the freedom of religion.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming, Bertrand J.A. dissenting, the decision of the trial judge and holding that By-law 184 of the City of Quebec was valid.\nW. Glen How for the appellant.\nE. Godbout Q.C. for the respondent.\nL. E. Beaulieu Q.C. and No\u00ebl Dorion Q.C. for the intervenant.\nThe dissenting judgment of Rinfret C.J. and Tasche\u00adreau J. was delivered by\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE: D\u00e9pouill\u00e9e de son extravagante mise-en-sc\u00e8ne et r\u00e9duite \u00e0 sa v\u00e9ritable dimension, cette cause, \u00e0 mon avis, est vraiment tr\u00e8s simple. Elle n'a s\u00fbrement pas l'ampleur et l'importance qu'ont tent\u00e9 de lui donner les T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah par le truchement de M. Laurier Saumur, l'appelant, se d\u00e9signant comme un mis\u00adsionnaire-\u00e9vang\u00e9liste.\nIl s'agit de la validit\u00e9 d'un r\u00e8glement municipal et il y a probablement eu des centaines et des centaines de causes de ce genre depuis la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration. Si, par contre, cette cat\u00e9gorie de causes n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise tr\u00e8s fr\u00e9quemment \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, c'est uniquement \u00e0 raison de son peu d'importance relative et de son application restreinte, dans chaque cas, au territoire de la municipalit\u00e9 concern\u00e9e.\nVoici le texte du r\u00e8glement attaqu\u00e9:\nR\u00e8glement n\u00b0 184\n1\u00b0 Il est, par le pr\u00e9sent r\u00e8glement, d\u00e9fendu de distribuer dans les rues de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, aucun livre, pamphlet, brochure, circulaire, fascicule quelconque sans avoir au pr\u00e9alable obtenu pour ce faire la permission par \u00e9crit du Chef de Police.\n2\u00b0 Toute personne qui contreviendra au pr\u00e9sent r\u00e8glement sera pas\u00adsible d'une amende avec ou sans les frais, et b d\u00e9faut du paiement imm\u00e9\u00addiat de ladite amende avec ou sans les frais, selon le cas, d'un emprison\u00adnement, le montant de ladite amende et le terme d'emprisonnement \u00e0 \u00eatre fix\u00e9 par la Cour du Recorder de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, \u00ea. sa discr\u00e9tion; mais ladite amende ne d\u00e9passera pas cent dollars, et l'emprisonnement n'exc\u00e9dera pas trois mois de calendrier; ledit emprisonnement cependant, devant cesser en tout temps avant l'expiration du terme fix\u00e9 par le paiement de ladite amende et des frais, selon le cas; et si l'infraction est r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9e, cette r\u00e9cidive constituera, jour par jour, apr\u00e8s sommation ou arrestation, une offense s\u00e9par\u00e9e.\nL'appelant, invoquant sa qualit\u00e9 de sujet de Sa Majest\u00e9 le Roi et de r\u00e9sident dans la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, all\u00e9guant en outre qu'il est un missionnaire-\u00e9vang\u00e9liste et l'un des T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah, d\u00e9clare qu'il consid\u00e8re de son devoir de pr\u00eacher la Bible, soit oralement, soit en distribuant des publications sous forme de livres, opuscules, p\u00e9riodiques, feuillets, etc., de maison en maison et dans les rues.\nIl pr\u00e9tend que le r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 184, reproduit plus haut, a pour effet de rendre ill\u00e9gale cette distribution de litt\u00e9\u00adrature sans l'approbation \u00e9crite du Chef de Police de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec. Il ajoute qu'en sa qualit\u00e9 de citoyen canadien il a un droit absolu \u00e0 l'expression de ses opinions et que cela d\u00e9coule de son droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 de parole, la libert\u00e9 de la presse et le libre exercice de son culte envers Dieu, tel que garanti par la Constitution britannique non \u00e9crite, par l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique britannique du Nord g\u00e9n\u00e9\u00adralement, et '\u00e9galement par les Statuts de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, sp\u00e9cialement la Loi concernant la libert\u00e9 des cultes et le bon ordre dans les \u00e9glises et leurs alentours (S.R.Q. 1941, c. 307). Il all\u00e8gue que la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec et la province de Qu\u00e9bec n'ont aucune juridiction, soit en loi, soit consti\u00adtutionnellement, pour adopter un r\u00e8glement tel que ci-dessus, et que ce dernier est ultra vires, inconstitutionnel, ill\u00e9gal et nul.\nD'apr\u00e8s lui, ce r\u00e8glement aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9, le 27 octobre 1933, express\u00e9ment pour emp\u00eacher les activit\u00e9s \u00e9vang\u00e9li\u00adques des T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah et ce r\u00e8glement est arbitraire, oppressif, partial et injustifi\u00e9; il est, en outre, discrimi\u00adnatoire, vindicatif et constitue un abus de pouvoir.\nIl demande qu'il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ce r\u00e8glement n'est pas autoris\u00e9 par la Charte de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec et qu'\u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, en ce qu'il tente de limiter la libert\u00e9 de parole et la libert\u00e9 de la presse, il empi\u00e8te sur la juridiction du Parlement du Canada et, en particulier, du Code criminel.\nL'appelant se plaignait, en plus, de la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation illimit\u00e9e et arbitraire en faveur du Chef de Police, ainsi qu'elle est contenue dans le r\u00e8glement, mais \u00e0 l'audition devant cette Cour il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il abandonnait ce moyen.\nIl all\u00e8gue que, par application du r\u00e8glement, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement arr\u00eat\u00e9 et poursuivi et qu'\u00e0 la date de l'insti\u00adtution de l'action, une information \u00e9tait encore pendante contre lui \u00e0 la Cour du Recorder de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, bien que la poursuite de cette information ait \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9e par bref de prohibition alors inscrit devant la Cour du Banc du Roi (en appel).\nLa d\u00e9claration de l'appelant conclut donc que le r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 184 de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, du moins en autant qu'il est lui-m\u00eame concern\u00e9, soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ultra vires, inconstitu\u00adtionnel, ill\u00e9gal et nul; que les Statuts de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, en autant qu'ils pr\u00e9tendent autoriser l'adoption de ce r\u00e8glement par la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, soient \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9s ultra vires, inconstitutionnels et ill\u00e9gaux; et que la Cour \u00e9mette une injonction permanente emp\u00eachant la Cit\u00e9 de 'Qu\u00e9bec, ses officiers, ses agents et ses repr\u00e9sentants de tenter de mettre en vigueur le r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 184, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi ils soient condamn\u00e9s pour m\u00e9pris de cour et aux p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s que cela comporte.\nL'intim\u00e9e, la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, a plaid\u00e9 que le r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 184 \u00e9tait une loi municipale l\u00e9galement pass\u00e9e dans l'exercice des pouvoirs de r\u00e9glementation de la Cit\u00e9 et conforme \u00e0 son acte d'incorporation; que la loi de la pro\u00advince, en vertu de laquelle le r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9, est constitutionnelle, l\u00e9gale et valide; que le r\u00e8glement concerne la propret\u00e9, le bon, ordre, la paix et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publiques, la pr\u00e9vention de troubles et \u00e9meutes et se rapporte \u00e0 l'\u00e9conomie int\u00e9rieure et au bon gouvernement local de la ville; que le demandeur a syst\u00e9matiquement contrevenu \u00e0 ce r\u00e8glement de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et s'est obstin\u00e9ment refus\u00e9 \u00e0 s'y soumettre; qu'il n'a jamais demand\u00e9 et, par cons\u00e9quent, n'a pu obtenir de permis pour distribuer ses pamphlets dans la ville de Qu\u00e9bec et qu'il a ignor\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re absolue si le r\u00e8glement est susceptible de le priver d'aucun de ses droits, ayant pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 y d\u00e9sob\u00e9ir de son plein gr\u00e9. Comme cons\u00e9quence, l'appelant fut condamn\u00e9 sui\u00advant la loi par un tribunal comp\u00e9tent.\nLa plaidoirie \u00e9crite all\u00e8gue, en outre, que l'appelant n'est pas un ministre du culte et que l'organisation dont il fait partie n'est pas une \u00e9glise ni une religion. Au contraire, les pamphlets ou tracts qu'elle insiste \u00e0 distribuer sans autorisation ont un caract\u00e8re provocateur et injurieux, ne sont pas des gestes religieux mais des actes anti-sociaux qui \u00e9taient et sont de nature \u00e0 troubler la paix publique et la tranquillit\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des paisibles citoyens dans la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, o\u00f9 ils risquent de provoquer des d\u00e9sordres. Il est malvenu en fait et en droit d'invoquer des libert\u00e9s de parole, de presse et de culte, qui ne sont aucunement concern\u00e9es en l'occurrence; il n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 pers\u00e9cut\u00e9 et, si la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec a mis en vigueur son r\u00e8glement, ce ne fut que pour remplir ses obligations envers le bien com\u00admun, l'ordre public exigeant que le r\u00e8glement soit d\u00fbment appliqu\u00e9 dans la Cit\u00e9.\nApr\u00e8s une longue enqu\u00eate et la production de quelque chose comme soixante-quinze exhibits, avec en plus des m\u00e9moires r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par l'abb\u00e9 Gagn\u00e9, le tr\u00e8s r\u00e9v\u00e9rend Doyen Evans, le rabbin Frank et M. Damien Jasmin, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a maintenu la d\u00e9fense et rejet\u00e9 l'action de l'appelant. Ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 dans son int\u00e9\u00adgrit\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc de la Reine (en appel)[2], (les honorables juges Barclay, Marchand, Pratte et Hyde), l'honorable juge Bertrand se d\u00e9clarant dissident. L'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance commence par dire dans son jugement qu'il est d'avis que la preuve offerte en cette cause \u00e9tait en grande partie inutile et ill\u00e9gale, mais qu'il l'a permise parce qu'il n'a pas voulu restreindre la libert\u00e9 de discussion et qu'il a d\u00e9sir\u00e9 fournir \u00e0 toutes les parties l'opportunit\u00e9 d'exposer leurs th\u00e9ories et leur doctrine.\nSur la question de savoir si la doctrine pr\u00each\u00e9e par les T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah est une religion ou non, il d\u00e9clare qu'il ne se prononce pas parce que, suivant lui, il \u00e9tait appel\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9cider seulement si le r\u00e8glement attaqu\u00e9 \u00e9tait ultra vires. Apr\u00e8s avoir cit\u00e9 les articles 335, 336 et 337 de la Charte de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, il se d\u00e9clare d'avis que le conseil de cette derni\u00e8re avait obtenu de la L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec le pouvoir d'adopter le r\u00e8glement en litige.\nDisons tout de suite que le texte de ces articles de la Charte ne laisse aucun doute sur ce point de vue et ce n'est pas l\u00e0-dessus que l'appelant a insist\u00e9.\nA ce sujet, cependant, le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure contient le paragraphe suivant:\n...Il ne s'agit pas d'une prohibition absolue.\nDe plus, le r\u00e8glement ne fait aucune distinction. Il s'applique \u00e0 tous les citoyens et n'a en soi aucun caract\u00e8re discriminatoire. Naturellement, il peut pr\u00eater \u00e0 des abus, mais dans cette cause, on ne se plaint nulle part qu'il y en ait eus. Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 que ce r\u00e8glement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement dans le but de limiter les activit\u00e9s du demandeur et des t\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah; au contraire, il s'applique \u00e0 tous, quelles que soient leur nationalit\u00e9, leur doctrine ou leur religion.\nL'honorable juge examine ensuite la question de savoir si la Cit\u00e9 avait le droit de d\u00e9l\u00e9guer ses pouvoirs \u00e0 son Chef de Police et il conclut dans l'affirmative. Il cite deux d\u00e9cisions de la Cour d'Appel de Qu\u00e9bec sur ce point et arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que le principe de d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de pouvoir, en pareil cas, lui para\u00eet admis, du moins dans l'\u00e9tat actuel de la jurisprudence. Mais, comme nous l'avons fait remarquer, nous n'avons plus \u00e0 nous occuper de ce pr\u00e9tendu motif d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 puisque, \u00e0 l'audition devant nous, le procureur de l'appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 formellement qu'il abandonnait ce moyen.\nLe savant juge analyse ensuite le jugement de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, rendu en 1938, sur la l\u00e9gislation de la province de l'Alberta: \"An Act to Ensure the Publi\u00adcation of accurate News and Information\"; \u00e9galement l'arr\u00eat de la Cour du Banc du Roi de Qu\u00e9bec dans la cause de Vaillancourt v. la Cit\u00e9 de Hull. A la suite de cette analyse, il d\u00e9clare en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que le r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 184 est intra vires, valide et l\u00e9gal. Il fait remar\u00adquer que l'appelant ne pouvait gu\u00e8re se plaindre sans avoir d'abord demand\u00e9 un permis, ce qu'il a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 et refus\u00e9 de faire. C'est ainsi qu'il aurait pu pr\u00e9tendre que l'officier charg\u00e9 d'\u00e9mettre des permis commettait des injustices \u00e0 son \u00e9gard et agissait d'une fa\u00e7on discriminatoire en lui refusant l'autorisation requise. C'est alors qu'il aurait eu un recours devant les tribunaux en se plaignant qu'il avait essuy\u00e9 un refus injuste et arbitraire et que l'on agissait envers lui d'une mani\u00e8re oppressive.\nComme le fait remarquer M. le Juge Barclay:\n...The Appellant complains of attacks and disorders. If this state of affairs is brought about by the contents of the pamphlets distributed it may well be that their distribution should be prohibited. I refrain from any comment on the contents of these publications, although they have been put before us by the Appellant. If a demand for a licence to distribute them be refused, then that question will be of importance, but not until then.\nLe principal jugement en la Cour du Banc de la Reine[3] a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit par M. le Juge Pratte. Il fait remarquer que les arr\u00eats rendus aux \u00c9tats-Unis ne sauraient avoir le moindre effet devant les 'tribunaux canadiens parce que la constitution des \u00c9tats-Unis garantit en termes formels la libert\u00e9 d'expression et la libert\u00e9 des cultes, tandis que chez-nous, au Canada, la situation juridique est diff\u00e9rente. \"La v\u00e9rit\u00e9, ici comme en Grande-Bretagne, c'est que, con\u00adtrairement \u00e0 ce qui est aux \u00c9tats-Unis, le peuple n'a pas abdiqu\u00e9 le pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en la mati\u00e8re, et que le cadre dans lequel peut s'exercer la libert\u00e9 que nous connaissons est susceptible d'\u00eatre modifi\u00e9 par l'autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative com\u00adp\u00e9tente\".\nL'honorable juge fait observer:\n...que les rues sont destin\u00e9es \u00e0 permettre le passage d'un endroit \u00e0 un autre (Harrison v. Duke of Rutland (1893), 1 Q.B., p. 142; Hickman v. Massey (1900), 1 Q.B. 752. C'est l\u00e0 leur fin premi\u00e8re, \u00e0 laquelle toute autre utilisation qu'on voudrait en faire est n\u00e9cessairement subordonn\u00e9e. Et s'il arrive que les rues soient utilis\u00e9es pour d'autres fins, c'est seulement \u00e0 la faveur d'un privil\u00e8ge sp\u00e9cialement octroy\u00e9, ou en raison d'une tol\u00e9rance \u00e0 laquelle l'autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente doit toujours pouvoir mettre fin lorsqu'elle juge que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public le requiert. Il faut bien qu'il en soit ainsi, pour emp\u00eacher que l'exercice du droit de se servir des rues suivant leur destination ne soit g\u00ean\u00e9 par ceux qui voudraient d\u00e9tourner les voies publiques de leur fin premi\u00e8re, ou que l'usage de la rue pour une fin autre que celle de passer ne devienne une cause de d\u00e9sordre.\nUn peu plus loin, l'honorable juge ajoute:\n...S'il n'est point douteux que l'usage des rues doive \u00eatre r\u00e9glement\u00e9, il est aussi certain que, d'une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ce pouvoir de r\u00e8glementation est du ressort de l'autorit\u00e9 locale. I1 n'est point n\u00e9cessaire de la d\u00e9mon\u00adtrer ici, car l'appelant le reconna\u00eet\u2026\nTandis que les dispositions du Code criminel sont destin\u00e9es \u00e0 assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'\u00c9tat et It maintenir un degr\u00e9 minimum de moralit\u00e9 par tout le pays, le r\u00e8glement attaqu\u00e9 lui, a seulement pour but de pr\u00e9venir l'utilisation des rues de la cit\u00e9 pour une fin contraire \u00e0 leur destination et que l'autorit\u00e9 locale comp\u00e9tente ne jugerait pas opportun de tol\u00e9rer.\nM. le Juge Hyde s'accorde d'une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale avec ses deux coll\u00e8gues, mais il r\u00e9f\u00e8re en particulier au jugement de la Cour Supr\u00eame dans la cause de Provincial Secretary of Prince Edward Island v. Egan[4], apr\u00e8s avoir dit:\n...Here there is no question but that the municipality has the power to enact by-laws for regulation of the use of its public thoroughfares and the prevention of nuisances thereon,\net il cite ce passage du jugement de la Cour, rendu par l'honorable Juge Rinfret, \u00e0 la page 415:\n...The right of building highways and of operating them within a province, whether under direct authority of the Government, or by means of independent Companies or municipalities, is wholly within the purview of the Province (O'Brien v. Allen, 30 S.C.R. 340), and so is the right to provide for the safety of circulation and traffic on such highways. The aspect of that field is wholly provincial, from the point of view of the use of the highway and of the use of the vehicles. It has to do with the civil regulation of the use of highways and personal property, the protection of the persons and property of the citizens, the prevention of nuisances and the suppression of conditions calculated to make circulation and traffic dangerous. Such is amongst others, the provincial aspect of section 84 of The Highway Traffic Act.\nDisons tout de suite que le r\u00e8glement en litige n'est rien autre chose qu'un r\u00e8glement de police; il est bas\u00e9 primordialement sur le fait que les rues ne doivent pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es pour fins de distribution de documents. L'usage normal des rues est celui de la circulation \u00e0 pied ou en voiture (Voir Dillon \"On Municipal Corporations\", 5\u00b0 \u00e9d., p. 1083; McQuillin \"On Municipal Corporations\", 2\u00b0 \u00e9d., vol. 3, p. 936 et suivantes; m\u00eame volume, p. 61, n\u00b0 938). Faisons remarquer d'abord que la Charte de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec est ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration (29-30 Vict. c. 57). La Cit\u00e9 n'est pas r\u00e9gie par la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 233, mais il n'est pas hors de propos de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 cette loi pour se rendre compte de l'\u00e9tendue des pouvoirs qui y sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s pour la r\u00e9glementation des rues.\nLe conseil y est attribu\u00e9 (art. 424) le pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de faire des r\u00e9glements \"pour assurer la paix, l'ordre, le bon gouvernement, la salubrit\u00e9, le bien-\u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et l'am\u00e9\u00adlioration de la municipalit\u00e9\". Plus sp\u00e9cialement (art. 426, par. 10), il peut \"r\u00e9glementer ou emp\u00eacher les jeux et les amusements sur les rues, all\u00e9es, trottoirs ou places publiques\"; il a le pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de nommer des agents de police ou constables avec autorit\u00e9 et juridiction dans 'les limites de la municipalit\u00e9 (par. 16a). Il peut (art. 428) \"prohiber, emp\u00eacher et supprimer les attroupe\u00adments, rixes, troubles, r\u00e9unions d\u00e9sordonn\u00e9es et tous spectacles ou amusements brutaux ou d\u00e9prav\u00e9s\"; \"permettre, moyennant le paiement d'une licence, et r\u00e9glementer l'affi\u00adchage de placards\"; \"emp\u00eacher qu'aucune congr\u00e9gation ou r\u00e9union pour le culte religieux ne soit troubl\u00e9e dans ses exercices, m\u00eame prohiber la distribution, aux portes des \u00e9glises, 'le dimanche, de toutes feuilles volantes ou circu\u00adlaires imprim\u00e9es\". Enfin et sp\u00e9cifiquement, sujet aux dispositions de la Loi relative aux rues publiques (S.R.Q. 1941, c. 242)\u2014\u00e0 laquelle il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer plus amplement\u2014en vertu de l'article 429, le conseil peut faire des r\u00e8glements de la plus grande \u00e9tendue pour l'ouverture et l'entretien des rues, des trottoirs et des places publiques, pour en r\u00e9glementer l'usage, emp\u00eacher et faire cesser tout empi\u00e9tement; prescrire la mani\u00e8re de placer les enseignes, poteaux d'enseignes, auvents, poteaux de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, de t\u00e9l\u00e9graphe et d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, abreuvoirs pour chevaux, rate\u00adliers et autres obstructions; faire dispara\u00eetre toute nuisance ou obstruction sur les trottoirs, rues, all\u00e9es et terrains publics et emp\u00eacher qu'ils ne soient encombr\u00e9s de voitures ou d'autres choses; r\u00e9glementer la vitesse des v\u00e9hicules dans les limites de la municipalit\u00e9; r\u00e9glementer l'usage des bicycles et des automobiles et les emp\u00eacher de circuler sur certaines rues; r\u00e9glementer ou d\u00e9fendre l'usage de voi\u00adtures bruyantes dans les rues et places publiques; r\u00e9gle\u00admenter ou d\u00e9fendre l'exhibition, ou le port, ou la distribution de banni\u00e8res, placards, annonces et prospectus ou autres articles dans les, pr\u00e8s des, ou sur les rues, all\u00e9es, trottoirs et places publiques; r\u00e9glementer ou emp\u00eacher le d\u00e9ploiement de drapeaux, banni\u00e8res et enseignes \u00e0 travers les rues et places publiques, et r\u00e9glementer, permettre moyennant un permis, ou d\u00e9fendre la construction et l'usage de tableaux \u00e0 affiches et enseignes le long ou pr\u00e8s des rues, all\u00e9es et places publiques ou sur les lots vacants ou ailleurs.\nCette longue \u00e9num\u00e9ration fait bien voir jusqu'\u00e0 quel point les municipalit\u00e9s ont le contr\u00f4le de leurs rues, en vertu de la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nLe r\u00e8glement attaqu\u00e9 est strictement du m\u00eame ordre d'id\u00e9e.\nIl est non moins clair que l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique britan\u00adnique du Nord 1867, dans la distribution qu'elle fait des pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs, aux paragraphes 91 et 92 attribue, dans chaque province, \u00e0 la L\u00e9gislature, le pouvoir exclusif de faire des lois relatives aux institutions municipales dans la province (par. 8), \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et les droits civils dans la province (par. 13) et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 toutes les mati\u00e8res d'une nature purement locale et priv\u00e9e dans la province (par. 16).\nIl serait vraiment fantastique de pr\u00e9tendre que quelques-uns des pouvoirs ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9s et que l'on trouve dans la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, pourraient relever du domaine f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Je ne me repr\u00e9\u00adsente pas facilement le Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral entreprenant d'adopter des lois sur aucune de ces mati\u00e8res (Voir le jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans Hodge v. The Queen[5]).\nJe ne comprends pas, d'ailleurs, que le procureur de l'appelant dirige son argumentation \u00e0 l'encontre de ce principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Il demande \u00e0 la Cour de s'\u00e9carter du texte( du r\u00e8glement et il cherche \u00e0 y trouver un motif qui serait celui, qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9claration, \"que ce r\u00e8glement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement dans le but de limiter les activit\u00e9s du demandeur et des T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah\". Il est \u00e0 remarquer que le r\u00e8glement lui-m\u00eame ne dit rien de tel; il s'applique \u00e0 tous, quelle que soit leur nationalit\u00e9, leur doctrine ou leur religion. Mais, en plus, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en fait qu'il \"n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 que ce r\u00e8glement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement dans ce but\". D'autre part, en mati\u00e8re d'exc\u00e8s de pouvoirs, c'est toujours au m\u00e9rite (\"pith and substance\") de la l\u00e9gislation qu'il faut s'arr\u00eater. Ce que le r\u00e8glement vise est uniquement l'usage des rues pour fins de distribution. En outre que, ainsi que l'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, aucun motif, aucune arri\u00e8re-pens\u00e9e n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9voil\u00e9e par la preuve faite \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate, c'est une id\u00e9e erron\u00e9e que de chercher \u00e0 attribuer un motif \u00e0 une loi qui n'en mentionne pas. Un r\u00e8glement peut \u00eatre valide m\u00eame si le but du conseil muni\u00adcipal est mauvais.\nJ'avoue trouver \u00e9trange que l'on mette m\u00eame en discus\u00adsion le pouvoir des corporations municipales de r\u00e9glemen\u00adter de la fa\u00e7on la plus absolue l'usage de leurs rues et d'en exercer le contr\u00f4le. Notre Cour s'est prononc\u00e9e l\u00e0-dessus d'une fa\u00e7on cat\u00e9gorique dans l'affaire de Winner v. S.M.T. (Eastern) Limited & Attorney General of Canada[6]. La majorit\u00e9 des juges a exprim\u00e9 alors l'avis, m\u00eame lorsqu'il s'agissait d'un cas de droit international, qu'une loi provin\u00adciale pouvait valablement stipuler que, dans les limites de la province du Nouveau-Brunswick, un bureau (\"board\"), en vertu de \"The Motor Carrier Act\", pouvait emp\u00eacher M. Winner, un propri\u00e9taire de ligne d'autobus, demeurant \u00e0 Lewiston, dans l'\u00c9tat du Maine, \u00c9tats-Unis, de faire des arr\u00eats dans les rues du Nouveau-Brunswick pour y prendre des passagers dont la destination \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du Nouveau-Brunswick.\nEn ce qui me concerne, je n'ai pas eu \u00e0 me prononcer sur ce point, parce que je suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 mes conclusions pour des raisons diff\u00e9rentes de celles de la majorit\u00e9, mais je n'ai aucune h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 ajouter que, si j'eusse eu \u00e0 le faire, je me serais accord\u00e9 avec la majorit\u00e9 sur ce sujet.\nEn envisageant le r\u00e8glement qui nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis, il est \u00e0 remarquer, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, que le texte de ce r\u00e8glement ne fait aucune allusion au caract\u00e8re religieux des tracts ou des feuillets qui sont vis\u00e9s. Je ne saurais me rendre \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e que, pour d\u00e9cider de la validit\u00e9 de ce r\u00e8glement, il faille aller au-del\u00e0 de ce qu'il dit et se demander si la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec en l'adoptant avait un motif ult\u00e9rieur. Cela n'importe pas du 'tout. Si une corporation municipale a le pouvoir de prohiber ou de contr\u00f4ler l'usage de ses rues, nous n'avons pas \u00e0 nous demander quel a pu \u00eatre son motif; pas plus, par exemple, qu'en reconnaissant \u00e0 tout citoyen le droit d'interdire l'acc\u00e8s de sa maison, on puisse disputer le motif qui le pousse \u00e0 en agir ainsi. Il se peut que sa raison soit qu'il ne veuille pas laisser entrer un communiste dans sa maison; m\u00eame si c'est l\u00e0 son motif cach\u00e9 ou son arri\u00e8re-pens\u00e9e, 'cela ne lui enl\u00e8ve pas son droit absolu de d\u00e9fendre l'acc\u00e8s de sa maison \u00e0 qui que ce soit. La Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec eut-elle eu m\u00eame dans l'id\u00e9e-ce que le r\u00e8glement ne fait pas voir\u2014de prendre ce moyen d'em\u00adp\u00eacher les T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah de distribuer leurs feuillets et leurs tracts, cela n'aurait jamais pour r\u00e9sultat de rendre sa d\u00e9cision ill\u00e9gale, ni surtout inconstitutionnelle.\nLa seule question que les tribunaux ont \u00e0 examiner est celle de savoir si la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec avait le pouvoir d'adop\u00adter ce r\u00e8glement. Nous n'avons pas \u00e0 chercher derri\u00e8re le texte qu'elle a adopt\u00e9 pour voir quel a pu \u00eatre son but en ce faisant. J'irai m\u00eame plus loin et je dirai que l'usage des rues d'une municipalit\u00e9 est indiscutablement une ques\u00adtion du domaine municipal et une question locale. Je cherche encore en vertu de quoi on pourrait pr\u00e9tendre que cette mati\u00e8re ne tombe pas exclusivement dans la cat\u00e9gorie des sujets attribu\u00e9s aux provinces en vertu de l'article 92 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique britannique du Nord; et, dans ce cas, m\u00eame s'il est admis que le droit de culte est du do\u00admaine f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, le pouvoir de contr\u00f4le des rues municipales, \u00e9tant un sujet sp\u00e9cifiquement attribu\u00e9 aux provinces, il aurait pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur le pouvoir suppos\u00e9 du Parlement f\u00e9\u00add\u00e9ral de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en mati\u00e8re de culte. Il est de jurispru\u00addence constante que du moment qu'un sujet est sp\u00e9cialement attribu\u00e9 au domaine provincial par l'article 92, il a pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance et priorit\u00e9 sur tout pouvoir que pr\u00e9tendrait exer\u00adcer le f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, en vertu des pouvoirs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux mentionn\u00e9s dans l'article 91.\nIl n'y a pas si longtemps que l'on a eu, dans la Cit\u00e9 d'Ottawa, l'exemple d'une loi provinciale qui permettait \u00e0 une municipalit\u00e9 d'emp\u00eacher la pratique des jeux commer\u00adcialis\u00e9s le dimanche, qui, cependant, sous un certain aspect, doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un exercice qui empi\u00e8terait sur l'observance du Jour du Seigneur et serait donc, si l'on admettait la pr\u00e9tention que je discute, du domaine des cultes et d'un caract\u00e8re religieux. Cette loi provinciale est dans les statuts de la province d'Ontario et jusqu'ici nul ne s'est avis\u00e9 d'en soulever l'inconstitutionnalit\u00e9.\nLa question de juridiction ne peut jamais d\u00e9pendre de la valeur des raisons qui sont donn\u00e9es, pas plus dans un r\u00e8glement que dans un jugement. Ce que l'appelant soul\u00e8ve et ce qu'il demande \u00e0 la Cour de prononcer, c'est que la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec n'avait pas le pouvoir d'adopter ce r\u00e8glement. Il ne pourra jamais justifier cette conclusion en pr\u00e9tendant que la Cit\u00e9 l'a .adopt\u00e9 pour un motif erron\u00e9.\nEn r\u00e9alit\u00e9, le v\u00e9ritable argument que l'appelant tente de faire pr\u00e9valoir c'est que ce r\u00e8glement l'emp\u00eache d'exercer son culte ou, comme il l'all\u00e8gue pour les fins de la cause, sa religion.\nJe partage absolument l'opinion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance et celle de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc de la Reine (en appel) \u00e0 l'effet que le r\u00e8glement attaqu\u00e9 ne fait rien de tel. Tout d'abord, ce n'est pas un r\u00e8glement qui prohibe: c'est un r\u00e8glement qui permet, sous certaines res\u00adtrictions.\nJe r\u00e9p\u00e8te que l'appelant devant la Cour se trouve, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, dans une position d\u00e9fectueuse, parce qu'il n'a pas soumis au Chef de police de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec les pamphlets qu'il avait l'intention de distribuer. Comme l'affirme la d\u00e9fense, il a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 ignorer absolument le r\u00e8glement et proc\u00e9der \u00e0 faire sa distribution sans en demander la permission. Il en r\u00e9sulte que nous ne savons pas ce que l'appelant voulait distribuer et nous ne connaissons nullement la nature de ces tracts.\nIl y a lieu, par cons\u00e9quent, de limiter notre investigation \u00e0 la question de savoir si vraiment l'appelant, par ce r\u00e8glement, est emp\u00each\u00e9 de pratiquer sa religion; et il faut encore restreindre le d\u00e9bat \u00e0 la question de savoir si l'appelant, par suite de ce r\u00e8glement, ne peut pas distribuer des pamphlets religieux dans les rues de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec. Car il est \u00e9vident que, sur ce chapitre, il faut que le r\u00e8glement prohibe la distribution des pamphlets religieux que l'appelant voudrait diss\u00e9miner. Cet argument ne vaut nullement \u00e0 l'encontre de la prohibition de distribuer tout autre pamphlet.\nIronie du sort, les T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah qui, dans leurs publications, affirment cat\u00e9goriquement non seulement qu'ils ne constituent pas une religion, mais qu'ils sont oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 toute religion et que les religions sont une invention du d\u00e9mon, sont maintenant devant les tribunaux du Canada pour demander protection au nom de la reli\u00adgion; et, \u00e0 cette fin, \u00e0 l'encontre de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 des lois municipales de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, ils sont con\u00adtraints d'invoquer une loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e0 savoir: la Loi concernant la libert\u00e9 des cultes et du bon ordre dans les \u00e9glises et leurs alentours (c. 307, S.R.Q. 1941).\nCette loi, invoqu\u00e9e par eux, contient l'article suivant:\n2. La jouissance et le libre exercice du culte de toute profession religieuse, sans distinction ni pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence. mais de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne pas servir d'excuse la licence ni \u00e0 autoriser des pratiques incompatibles avec la paix et la s\u00fbret\u00e9 de la province, sont permis par la constitution et les lois de cette province \u00e0 tous les sujets de Sa Majest\u00e9 qui y vivent. S.R. 1925, c. 198, a. 2.\nC'est bien ainsi que l'appelant a pos\u00e9 le probl\u00e8me dans sa d\u00e9claration :\n...his unqualified right as a Canadian citizen to the expression of his views on the issues of the day and in employing thereby his right of freedom of speech, freedom of the press and free exercise of worship of Almighty God as guaranteed by the unwritten British Constitution, by the provisions of the British North America Act generally and, in particular, in its preamble and sections 91, 92 and 129, as well as by the statute of the Province of Quebec generally and in particular, by \"An Act Respecting Peddlers\", (R.S.Q. 1941, Chapter 230, especially section 8 thereof) ; and by \"An Act Respecting Licences\", (R.S.Q. 1941, Chapter 76, especially section 82 thereof); and by \"An Act Respecting Freedom of Worship and the Maintenance of Good Order In and Near Places of Public Worship\", (R.S.Q. 1941, 'Chapter 307, especially section 2 thereof) ;\nIl n'y a pas lieu de s'arr\u00eater \u00e0 la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la Loi concernant les colporteurs et \u00e0 la Loi des licences.\nLe procureur de l'appelant ne s'est pas non plus expliqu\u00e9 sur ce qu'il entend par \"the unwritten British Constitution\" comme gouvernant les pouvoirs respectifs du Parlement canadien et des L\u00e9gislatures provinciales (tels qu'ils sont d\u00e9finis dans les articles 91 et 92 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique britannique du Nord). C'est cette loi qui contient la Constitution du Canada et le Conseil Priv\u00e9, \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les pouvoirs ainsi distribu\u00e9s entre le Parlement et les l\u00e9gislatures couvraient absolument tous les pouvoirs que pouvait exercer le Canada comme entit\u00e9 politique. Mais l'appelant pr\u00e9tend que la question de l'exercice du culte est exclusivement de la juridiction du Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et, en particulier, que les prescriptions du r\u00e8glement attaqu\u00e9 seraient couvertes par le d\u00e9but de l'article 91 qui autorise l'adoption de \"lois pour la paix, l'ordre et le bon gouvernement du Canada\", ou la Loi criminelle.\nAu sujet de la premi\u00e8re pr\u00e9tention, il suffit de poursuivre la lecture de l'article 91 pour constater que le pouvoir du Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral relativement \u00e0 la paix, l'ordre et le bon gouvernement du Canada se bornent \u00e0 toutes les mati\u00e8res ne tombant pas dans les \"cat\u00e9gories de sujets exclusivement assign\u00e9s par le pr\u00e9sent acte aux L\u00e9gislatures des provinces\". Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 invariablement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 et conform\u00e9ment, d'ailleurs, au texte pr\u00e9cis que nous venons de citer, d\u00e8s que la mati\u00e8re est couverte par l'un des paragraphes de l'article 92, elle devient du domaine exclusif des l\u00e9gislatures de chaque province et elle est soustraite \u00e0 la juridiction du Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Naturellement, nous ne parlons plus ici du contr\u00f4le des rues municipales, car il est \u00e9vident que, dans ce cas, les paragraphes 8, 13 et 16 de l'article 92 (comme d'ailleurs nous l'avons vu plus haut) attribuent cette juridiction exclusivement aux l\u00e9gislatures. Mais, si nous comprenons bien la pr\u00e9tention, c'est que la garantie de l'exercice du culte doit venir du Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et n'appartient pas aux l\u00e9gislatures. Nous disons bien qu'elle doit venir, car il est tr\u00e8s certain que, pour le moment, elle n'existe pas ailleurs que dans la Loi concer\u00adnant la libert\u00e9 des cultes invoqu\u00e9e par l'appelant dans sa d\u00e9claration (S.R.Q. 1941, c. 307).\nLa difficult\u00e9 qu'\u00e9prouve ici l'appelant r\u00e9sulte de plusieurs raisons:\nPremi\u00e8rement:\u2014Son droit de distribuer des pamphlets religieux ne constitue pas l'exercice d'un culte d'une pro\u00adfession religieuse.\nDeuxi\u00e8mement :\u2014A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, la jouissance et le libre exercice du culte d'une profession religieuse ne jouit pas, en vertu du chapitre 307, S.R.Q. 1941; d'une autorisation absolue, mais il faut que ce culte s'exerce \"de ma\u00adni\u00e8re \u00e0 ne pas servir d'excuse \u00e0 la licence, ni \u00e0 autoriser des pratiques incompatibles avec la paix et la s\u00fbret\u00e9 de la province\".\nTroisi\u00e8mement :\u2014L'exercice du culte est un droit civil et, par cons\u00e9quent, tombe sous le paragraphe 13 de l'article 92 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique britannique du Nord. Il est donc du domaine provincial.\nLe premier point ci-dessus d\u00e9pend d'une question de fait. Or, l'appelant a fait entendre comme t\u00e9moin un monsieur Hayden C. Covington, qui s'est d\u00e9crit comme \"ordained minister of the gospel, and lawyer, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York\". Au cours de ce t\u00e9moignage, ce t\u00e9moin a identifi\u00e9 un nombre consid\u00e9rable de publications dont il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elles contenaient la doctrine des T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah, en ajoutant: \"They comprise the official view, doctrines and principles advocated and taught by Jehovah's Witnesses at the date of publication of each of such books\". Or, clans toutes ces publications, il est affirm\u00e9 que les T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah ne sont pas une religion; que, au contraire, leur but est de combattre toutes les religions et que la religion est une invention du d\u00e9mon. Nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0, au d\u00e9but de ce jugement, fait allusion \u00e0 cette doctrine.\nDans les circonstances, il m'est impossible de voir en vertu de quoi les T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah pourraient invoquer la libert\u00e9 du culte qui est pr\u00e9vue dans le chapitre 307 des Statuts Refondus de Qu\u00e9bec 1941. D'ailleurs, il serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9 de pr\u00e9tendre que, par application du chapitre 307, aucune manifestation religieuse ne pourrait \u00eatre emp\u00each\u00e9e par r\u00e8glement. C'est ainsi qu'il est de pratique courante que les municipalit\u00e9s ne permettent pas la vente d'insignes (\"tag-days\"), pour fins de bienfaisance, sans une autori\u00adsation qui est r\u00e9serv\u00e9e au conseil; et je n'entretiens pas le moindre doute qu'une corporation municipale a le pouvoir d'interdire les processions religieuses dans ses rues, quelle que soit la nature ou le caract\u00e8re de ces processions. J'ai m\u00eame eu connaissance de r\u00e8glements municipaux qui d\u00e9fendaient aux \u00e9glises de sonner les cloches pour appeler les fid\u00e8les aux exercices religieux. Pour ce qui est du deuxi\u00e8me point ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9, il faut r\u00e9it\u00e9rer que l'article 2 du chapitre 307 ne permet pas la jouissance et le libre exercice du culte d'une pro\u00adfession religieuse d'une fa\u00e7on absolue. Il faut que cela ne \"serve pas d'excuse \u00e0 la licence, ni \u00e0 des pratiques incom\u00adpatibles avec la paix et la s\u00fbret\u00e9 de la province\". C'est le texte m\u00eame de la loi.\nSi donc, \u00e0 l'encontre de la preuve, il fallait d\u00e9cider que les T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah pratiquent un culte, il n'en fau\u00addrait pas moins, en vertu du texte de la Loi concernant la libert\u00e9 des cultes, que la province ou la municipalit\u00e9 ait le droit de contr\u00f4ler cet exercice \"de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne pas servir d'excuse \u00e0 la licence, ni \u00e0 autoriser des pratiques incompatibles avec la paix et la s\u00fbret\u00e9 de la province\".\nPuisque les T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah pr\u00e9tendent que leur pro\u00adfession religieuse consiste \u00e0 distribuer des tracts religieux, il s'ensuit que la province ou la municipalit\u00e9, \u00e0 laquelle la province d\u00e9l\u00e8gue ce pouvoir, a le droit d'examiner les pamphlets religieux que l'on entend distribuer, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 en autoriser ou non la distribution.\nA cet \u00e9gard, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, les T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah, ayant pris la position qu'ils ne demanderaient pas l'autorisation et qu'ils ne soumettraient pas la litt\u00e9rature qu'ils voulaient distribuer, nous n'avons aucune preuve au dossier susceptible de nous permettre de savoir si cette litt\u00e9rature tombait ou non dans les exceptions pr\u00e9vues par l'article 2 du chapitre 307. Mais, si nous nous croyions justifi\u00e9s de prendre pour acquit que cette litt\u00e9rature serait de la m\u00eame nature que les livres et les tracts qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits au dossier, ou encore qu'elle contiendrait les d\u00e9clarations faites par le vice-pr\u00e9sident Covington, il serait inconcevable qu'une municipalit\u00e9 ne put emp\u00eacher la circulation dans ses rues de. cette litt\u00e9rature que son conseil pourrait cer\u00adtainement consid\u00e9rer comme constituant de la licence ou des pratiques incompatibles avec la paix et la s\u00fbret\u00e9 de la province; et, d\u00e8s lors, comme tombant dans l'exception exprim\u00e9e dans l'article 2.\nVoici, en effet, ce qu'on trouve dans le t\u00e9moignage de M. Covington:\nQ. Are you informed that the religion of a greater part of the people in this province and in this city is Roman Catholic?\u2014A. Yes, I have that information. En fait, il est notoire que 90 pour cent de la population de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec est catholique romaine et 45 pour cent de la population du Canada appartient \u00e0 la m\u00eame religion.\nOn lui demande alors de lire les passages suivants des publications des T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah:\n...Religion is the adulteress and idolatress that befriends and commits religious fornication with the political and commercial elements. She is the lover of this world and blesses the world from the balcony of the Vatican and in the pulpits. Religion, whose most powerful representative has ruled from Rome for sixteen centuries, traces her origin all the way back to Babylon of Nimrod's founding, and organized religion deservedly bears the name Babylon I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore (or idolatress) that sitteth upon many waters: with whom the kings of the earth have com\u00admitted fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication; and upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.\nLes citations qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent sont tir\u00e9es de l'exhibit D-49, aux pages 345 et 346.\nApr\u00e8s avoir mis le t\u00e9moin Covington en pr\u00e9sence des extraits ci-dessus, l'avocat de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec lui demande :\nQ. Do you consider that writing such books with such insults against another religion, in fact the religion practised by the people of this province or city, a proper means of preaching the gospel?\u2014A. I do.\nEt au cours de cette r\u00e9ponse, il dit :\n...history abundantly attests to the fact that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has had relationship with the world and has had part tacitly in the wars between the nations and the destruction of nations.\nUn peu plus loin:\nQ. Do you consider necessary for your organization to attack the other religions, in fact, the Catholic, the Protestant and the Jews?\u2014A. Indeed. The reason for that is because the Almighty God commands that error shall be exposed and not persons or nations.\nLa Cour demande au m\u00eame t\u00e9moin :\nQ. You are the only witnesses of the truth?\u2014A. Jehovah's Witnesses are the only witnesses to the truth of Almighty God Jehovah... Q. Is the Roman Catholic a true church?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Is it an unclean woman?\u2014A. It is pictured in the Bible as a whore, as having illicit relationship with the nations of this world, and history proves that fact, history that all have studied in school.\nA un autre point de vue, ce m\u00eame t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clare:\nIf obedience to a law of the state or nation would compel them (les T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah) to thereby violate God's law, they will obey God rather than men. Ce que, d'ailleurs, il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 affirm\u00e9 peu de temps aupa\u00adravant au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, \u00e0 une demande de la Cour:\nQ. Notwithstanding the laws of the country to the contrary?\u2014A. Notwithstanding the laws of the country to the contrary.\nQui oserait pr\u00e9tendre que des pamphlets contenant les d\u00e9clarations qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, distribu\u00e9s dans une cit\u00e9 comme celle de Qu\u00e9bec, ne constitueraient pas une pratique incom\u00adpatible avec la paix et la s\u00fbret\u00e9 de la Cit\u00e9 ou de la pro\u00advince? Quel tribunal condamnerait un conseil municipal qui emp\u00eacherait la circulation de pareilles d\u00e9clarations? Et je n'ai choisi que quelques passages dans des livres et des tracts qui fourmillent de semblables affirmations. La d\u00e9cence, d'ailleurs, me commanderait de ne pas en citer davantage. Et cela ne me para\u00eet pas n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9montrer qu'une municipalit\u00e9, dont 90 pour cent de la population est catholique, a non seulement le droit, mais le devoir, d'emp\u00eacher la diss\u00e9mination de pareilles infamies.\nEnfin, le dernier point c'est la question que l'exercice des cultes est un droit civil qui rel\u00e8ve de la juridiction des l\u00e9gislatures provinciales. C'est ainsi que l'ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les provinces de la Saskatchewan et de l'Alberta, qui ont adopt\u00e9 des lois intitul\u00e9es: An Act to Protect Certain Civil Rights (1947, 11 Geo. VI, c. 35). L'objet de la loi est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans le pr\u00e9ambule comme \u00e9tant \"to protect certain civil rights\" et l'article 3 de la Loi stipule:\n...Every person and every class of persons shall enjoy the right to freedom of conscience, opinion and belief, and freedom of religious association, teaching, practice and worship.\nLa province de 'l'Alberta a un statut semblable.\nIl est int\u00e9ressant, sur ce point, de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 'l'interpr\u00e9\u00adtation donn\u00e9e par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 de l'expression \"civil rights\" dans l'Acte de Qu\u00e9bec de 1774, dans la cause de Citizens Insurance Company of Canada v. Parsons[7] :\n...It is to be observed that the same words, \"Civil rights\" are employed in the Act of 14 Geo. 3, c. 83, which made provision for the Government of the province of Quebec, Sect. 8 of that Act enacted that His Majesty's Canadian subjects within the province of Quebec should enjoy their property, usages, and other civil rights, as they had before done, and that in all matters of controversy relative to property and civil rights resort should be had to the laws of Canada, and be determined agreably to the said laws. In this statute the words \"property\" and \"civil rights\" are plainly used in their largest sense; and there is no reason for holding that in the statute under discussion they are used in a different and narrower one.\nIl suffit de signaler la contradiction de l'argumentation du procureur de l'appelant qui, d'une part, all\u00e8gue l'inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 de la Charte de Qu\u00e9bec, en invoquant, d'autre part, qu'elle est en conflit avec la Loi concernant la libert\u00e9 des cultes (S.R.Q. 1941, c. 307) de cette m\u00eame province de Qu\u00e9bec. Il est indiscutable que la l\u00e9gislature qui a adopt\u00e9 le chapitre 307 avait la comp\u00e9tence voulue pour adopter la Charte de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, en vertu de laquelle le r\u00e8glement 184 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9.\nEn plus, d'ailleurs, le chapitre 307 n'est rien autre chose qu'une loi d\u00e9claratoire d'un statut ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9\u00adration, dont le procureur de l'appelant a fait grand cas. On la trouve dans les Statuts Revis\u00e9s du Canada de 1859, c. 74, qui est lui-m\u00eame la reproduction d'une loi de 1851.\nEt alors entre en cause l'article 129 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9\u00adrique britannique du Nord 1867, en vertu duquel toutes les lois en vigueur en Canada lors de l'Union continuent d'exister, entre autres, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, \"comme si l'Union n'avait pas eu lieu\": Elles peuvent \"\u00eatre r\u00e9vo\u00adqu\u00e9es, abolies ou modifi\u00e9es par le Parlement du Canada ou par la l\u00e9gislature de la province respective, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 du Parlement ou de cette l\u00e9gislature, en vertu du pr\u00e9sent acte\". Mais, il n'y a pas lieu de se demander ici si la, r\u00e9vocation \u00e9tait du ressort du Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou de la L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec ou d'Ontario, parce que telle r\u00e9vocation n'a pas eu lieu. Le Parlement du Canada a nullement r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 ou modifi\u00e9 cette loi ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration et, par cons\u00e9quent, en vertu m\u00eame de l'article 129 de la Constitution, cette loi a continu\u00e9 d'\u00eatre en vigueur dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec \"comme si l'Union n'avait pas eu lieu\". En vain l'appelant a-t-il pr\u00e9tendu qu'un r\u00e8glement de ce genre avait le caract\u00e8re d'une loi criminelle et serait, d\u00e8s lors, du domaine du Parlement du Canada, en vertu du paragraphe 27 de l'article 91 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique britannique du Nord. Ce r\u00e8glement n'a aucunement l'aspect de la d\u00e9finition d'un acte criminel. On peut voir, sous ce rapport, ce que dit Lord Hewart dans Thomas v. Sawkins[8], et \u00e9galement, dans la m\u00eame cause, les commentaires de Avory J. Nous avons l\u00e0 une situation semblable \u00e0 celle qui fut \u00e9tudi\u00e9e par cette Cour dans la cause de Provincial Secre\u00adtary of Prince Edward Island v. Egan[9], d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e plus haut. La Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada ne faisait alors que r\u00e9it\u00e9rer ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 dit dans In Re McNutt[10], et surtout dans B\u00e9dard v. Dawson[11], o\u00f9 cette Cour a maintenu la validit\u00e9 d'un statut de Qu\u00e9bec autorisant la Cour \u00e0 ordonner la fermeture d'une maison de d\u00e9sordre sur le principe qu'il s'agit l\u00e0 d'une mati\u00e8re de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et de droit civil et qui ne tombe pas sous le coup de la Loi cri\u00adminelle. D'ailleurs, les provinces ont le pouvoir d'aider \u00e0 l'application du droit criminel en tentant de supprimer le crime et le d\u00e9sordre, comme le faisait remarquer le Juge en chef Duff dans l'affaire des Lois de la province d'Ontario relatives aux enfants abandonn\u00e9s ou n\u00e9glig\u00e9s[12].\nSur le tout, je n'ai donc aucune h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 dire que le r\u00e8glement attaqu\u00e9 est l\u00e9gal, valide et constitutionnel et que les jugements qui l'ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 tel doivent \u00eatre con\u00adfirm\u00e9s, avec d\u00e9pens.\nKERWIN J.:\u2014The appellant Saumur is a member of Jehovah's Witnesses and by action, brought in the Superior Court of Quebec, asks that by-law 184 of the City of Quebec, passed October 27, 1933, be declared to 'be-both on its face and in so far as he is concerned\u2014ultra vires, unconstitu\u00adtional, illegal, null and void and be quashed and set aside for all legal purposes. The Superior Court, and the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side)[13] with Bertrand J. dis\u00adsenting, dismissed the action and hence this appeal.\nClause 2 of the by-law provides penalties for the breach of clause 1, the important provision, which is in these words:\u2014\nlo.\u2014It is, by the present by-law forbidden to distribute in the streets of the City of Quebec, any book, pamphlet, booklet, circular, tract whatever without having previously obtained for so doing the written permission of the Chief of Police.\nCounsel for the appellant declined to contend that the by-law was invalid because a discretion was delegated to the Chief of Police. Counsel for the respondent, the City of Quebec, and for the intervenant, the Attorney General of Quebec, did not deal with the point and nothing is therefore said about it. However, an argument was advanced based upon a pre-Confederation statute of 1852 of the old Province of Canada, 14-15 Viet. e. 175, the relevant part of which provides:\u2014\nthe free exercise and enjoyment of Religious Profession and Worship, without discrimination or preference, so as the same be not made an excuse for acts of licentiousness, or a justification of practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the Province, is by the constitution and laws of this Province allowed to all Her Majesty's subjects within the same.\nSection 129 of the British North America Act, 186'7, enacts:\u2014\n129. Except as otherwise provided by this Act, all Laws in force in Canada, Nova Scotia, or New Brunswick at the Union, and all Courts of Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction, and all legal Commissions, Powers, and Authorities, and all Officers, Judicial, Administrative and Ministerial, existing therein at the Union, shall continue in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick respectively, as if the Union had not been made; subject nevertheless (except with respect to such as are enacted by or exist under Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain or of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) to be repealed, abolished, or altered by the Parliament of Canada, or by the Legislature of the respective Province, according to the Authority of the Parliament or of that Legislature under this Act.\nBy virtue of this section that part of the pre-Confedera\u00adtion statute extracted above continued to operate in the Province of Quebec at the time of the coming into force of the British North America Act. Since then the Quebec Legislature enacted legislation practically in the same words, and certainly to the same effect, which legislation has been continued from time to time and is now found in section 2 of R.S.Q. 1941, e. 307, The Freedom of Worship Act. Whether or not such legislation be taken to supersede the pre-Confederation enactment, no statutes such as the Quebec City Charter, in the general terms in which they are expressed, and whenever originally enacted, have the effect of abrogating the specific terms of the enactment providing for freedom of worship.\nIt appears from the material filed on behalf of the appel\u00adlant that Jehovah's Witnesses not only do not consider themselves as belonging to a religion but vehemently attack anything that may ordinarily be so termed but in my view they are entitled to \"the free exercise and enjoyment of (their) Religious Profession and Worship.\" The Witnesses attempt to spread their views by way of the printed and written word as well as orally and state that such attempts are part of their belief. Their attacks on religion gener\u00adally, or on one in particular, do not bring them within the exception \"so as the same be not made an excuse for licen\u00adtiousness or a justification of practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the Province.\" While several defini\u00adtions of \"licentious\" appear in standard dictionaries, the prevailing sense of that term is said to be \"libertine, las\u00adcivious, lewd.\" To certain biblical expressions the pamph\u00adlets, etc., of Jehovah's Witnesses which they desire to distribute attach a meaning which is offensive to a great majority of the inhabitants of the Province of Quebec. But, if they have a legal right to attempt to spread their beliefs, as I think they have, the expressions used by them in so doing, as exemplified in the exhibits filed, do not fall within the first part of the exception. Nor in my opinion are their attacks \"inconsistent with the peace and safety of the Province\" even where they are directed particularly against the religion of most of the Province's residents. The peace and safety of the Province will not be endangered if that majority, do not use the attacks as a foundation for breaches of the peace.\nConfined to the argument now under consideration, the above reasons do not justify a declaration that the by-law is ultra vires the City of Quebec since, if not otherwise objectionable, the by-law may have its effect in other cases and under other circumstances; but they do Warrant a declaration that the by-law does not extend so as to pro\u00adhibit the appellant as a member of Jehovah's Witnesses from distributing in the streets of Quebec any book, pamphlet, booklet, circular or tract of Jehovah's Witnesses included in the exhibits and an injunction restraining the City, its officers and agents from in any way interfering with such actions of the appellant.\nThe appellant further contended that the by-law should be declared illegal on the ground that the Provincial Legis\u00adlature has no power to authorize the Council of the City of Quebec to pass a general by-law prohibiting the distribu\u00adtion of books, pamphlets, etc., in the City streets. At first he argued that the subject-matter of any such legislation and by-law falls under section 91 of the British North America Act and not section 92, but later changed his posi\u00adtion by arguing that neither Parliament nor the Provincial Legislatures possessed the requisite power. I am unable to agree with either of these submissions. I do not find it helpful to refer to rights conferred by early treaties or sanc\u00adtioned by Imperial Statutes dealing with the old colonies and subdivisions of what is now Canada since it, is well-settled that the British North America Act has conferred all powers of legislation either upon Parliament or the Legislatures of the Provinces and that there is no field in which the one or the others may not operate: Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[14] :\nTheir Lordships have to construe the express words of an Act of Parliament which makes an elaborate distribution of the whole field of legislative authority between two legislative bodies, and at the same time provides for the federated provinces a carefully balanced constitution, under which no one of the parts can pass laws for itself except under the control of the whole acting through the Governor-General. And the question they have to answer is whether the one body or the other has power to make a given law.\nAttorney General for Ontario v. Attorney General for Canada (Companies Reference)[15] :\nIn 1867 the desire of Canada for a definite Constitution embracing the entire Dominion was embodied in the British North America Act. Now, there can be no doubt that under this organic instrument the powers distributed between the Dominion on the one hand and the provinces on the other hand cover the whole area of self-government within the whole area of Canada. It would be subversive of the entire scheme and policy of the Act to assume that any point of internal self-government was withheld from Canada.\nIn my view the right to practise one's religion is a civil right in the Province under head 13 of section 92 of the British North America Act just as much as the right to strike or lock-out dealt with by the Judicial Committee in Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider[16]. That deci\u00adsion, as has been often remarked, was made inter partes, and at page 403 Viscount Haldane states:\u2014\nWhatever else may be the effect of this enactment (The Industrial Disputes Investigation Act, 1907, of Caanda), it is clear that it is one which could have been passed, so far as any Province was concerned, by the Provincial Legislature under the powers conferred by s. 92 of the British North America Act. For its provisions were concerned directly with the civil rights of both employers and 'employed in the Province. It set up a Board of Inquiry which could summon them before it, administer to them oaths, call for their papers and enter their premises. It did no more than what a Provincial Legislature could have done under head 15 of s. 92, when it imposed punishment by way of penalty in order to enforce the new restrictions on civil rights. It interfered further with civil rights when, by s. 55 it suspended liberty to lock-out or strike during a reference to a Board. It does not appear that there is anything in the Dominion Act which could not have been enacted by the Legisla\u00adture of Ontario, excepting one provision. The field for the operation of the Act was made the whole of Canada.\nFor the same reason I also think that freedom of the press is a civil right in the Province. In Re Alberta Infor\u00admation Act[17], Sir Lyman Duff stated a short ground con\u00adsidered by him (and Davis J.) sufficient to dispose of the question as to whether Bill No. 9 of the Legislative As\u00adsembly of Alberta, \"An Act to Ensure the Publication of Accurate News and Information\" was intra vires the Legis\u00adlature of that Province. With the greatest respect I am unable to agree with that part of his ensuing reasons for judgment commencing at the foot of page 132 and continu\u00ading to the end of page 135, and particularly the following statement:\u2014 \"Any attempt to abrogate this right of public debate or to express the traditional forms of the exercise of the right (in public meeting and through the press), would, in our opinion be incompetent to the Legis\u00adlature of the Province.\" Also, with respect, I must dissent from the views of Cannon J. upon this topic as expressed in the same report.\nWe have not a Bill of Rights such as is contained in the United States Constitution and decisions on that part of the latter are of no assistance. 'While it is true that, as recited in the preamble to the British North America Act the three Provinces expressed a desire to be federally united with a constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom, a complete division of legislative powers being effected by the Act, I assume as it was assumed in Re Adop\u00adtion Act[18], (with reference, it is true, to entirely different matters) that Provincial Legislatures are willing and able to deal with matters of importance and substance that are within their legislative jurisdiction. It is perhaps needless to say that nothing in the foregoing has reference to mat\u00adters that are confined to Parliament. As to both freedom of religion and freedom of the press, with relation to the use of highways in the Province, I have already stated my view in Winner v. S.M.T.[19], that highways, generally speaking, fall within \"Property and Civil Rights in the Province\" under head 13 of section 92 of the British North America Act. As to what are the rights of the public in highways, it is sufficient to refer to Woolrych's Laws of Ways, p. 3:\u2014 \"The King's highway is a public passage for the King and his subjects\" and Pratt and McKenzie's Law of Highways, 19th ed. pp. 1 and 2:\u2014\"The right of the public in a highway is an easement of passage only-a right of passing and repassing. In the lan\u00adguage of pleading, a party can only justify passing along, and not being in, a highway\".\nThe appeal should be allowed and a declaration and injunction granted in the terms set out above. Although he does not secure all that he claims, the appellant is entitled to his costs of the action and of the appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side). He is also entitled to his costs of the present appeal except that nothing should be allowed for the preparation of a factum. Rule 30 of the Rules of this Court provides for the contents of the factum or points of argument of each party, Part 3 whereof is to consist of \"A brief of the argument setting out the points of law or fact to be discussed.\" This Rule was not complied with by the appellant filing two volumes containing 912 mimeographed pages together with an appendix thereto of 86 mimeographed pages. The costs awarded the appel\u00adlant are payable by the respondent, the City of Quebec: No order should be made, as to costs for or against the intervenant, the Attorney General of Quebec.\nRAND J.:\u2014The appellant seeks a declaration that by-law No. 184, of the City of Quebec, passed in October, 1933, is beyond the legislative power of the province:\u2014\n1. It is by the present by-law forbidden to distribute in the streets of the City of Quebec any book, pamphlet, booklet, circular, or tract whatever without having previously obtained for so doing the written, permission of the Chief of Police.\nContravention is punishable by fine, with imprisonment in default of payment. No question is raised that the by-law is not authorized by the city charter, and the grounds. upon which it is challenged are that it infringes the freedom of religious worship, secured by a statute to which I shall later refer, and that it trenches upon the jurisdiction of the Dominion in restraining freedom of communication by writings.\nThe practice under it is undisputed and as stated to us by counsel is this: when a license is sought, a copy of the document or writing proposed to be distributed is brought to the police department and there the chief officer, acting with or without the city solicitor or others, or in his absence, an official representing him, peruses the writing; if there is nothing in it considered from any standpoint to be objectionable, the license issues; if there is, suggestions are made that the offending matter be removed, but if that is not done the license is refused.\nAs in all controversies of this nature, the first enquiry goes to the real nature and character of the by-law; in what substance and aspect of legislative matter is it enacted? and we must take its objects and purposes to be what its language fairly embraces. The by-law places no restric\u00adtion on the discretion of the officer and none has been sug\u00adgested. If, under cover of such a blanket authority, action may be taken which directly deals with matters beyond provincial powers, can the fact that the language may, at the same time, encompass action on matters within pro\u00advincial authority preserve it from the taint of ultra vires? May a court enter upon a delineation of the limits and contours of the valid and invalid areas within it? Must the provision stand or fall as one or can it be severed or otherwise dealt with? These are the subsidiary questions to be answered.\nWhat the practice under the by-law demonstrates is that the language comprehends the power of censorship. From its inception, printing has been recognized as an agency of tremendous possibilities, and virtually upon its introduction into Western Europe it was brought under the control and license of government. At that time, as now in despotisms, authority viewed with fear and wrath the uncensored printed Word: it is and has been the b\u00eate noire of dog\u00admatists in every field of thought ; and the seat of its legis\u00adlative control in this country becomes a matter of the highest , moment. The Christian religion, its practices and profession, ex\u00adhibiting in Europe and America an organic continuity, stands in the first rank of social, political and juristic importance. The Articles of Capitulation in 1760, the Treaty of Paris in 1763, and the Quebec Act of 1774, all contain special provisions placing safeguards against restrictions upon its freedom, which were in fact liberations from the law in force at the time in England. The Quebec Act, by sec. 5, declared that His Majesty's subjects,\nprofessing the religion of the Church of Rome of and in the said Province of Quebec, may have, hold and enjoy, the free exercise of the religion ,of the Church of Rome, subject to the King's supremacy ...\nand, by sec. 15, that\nno ordnance touching religion ... shall be of any force or effect until the saine shall have received His Majesty's approbation.\nThis latter provision, in modified form, was continued by sec. 42 of the Constitutional Act of 1791:\u2011\nwhenever any act or acts shall \u2026 in any manner relate to or affect the enjoyment of or exercise of any religious form or mode of worship\nthe proposed Act was to be laid before both Houses of Par\u00adliament and the assent of the Sovereign could be given only if within thirty days thereafter no address from either House to withhold assent had been presented. The Union Act of 1840, sec. 42, contained a like provision. In each of the latter Acts existing laws were continued by secs. 33 and 46 respectively. From 1760, therefore, to the present moment religious freedom has, in our legal system, been recognized as a principle of fundamental character; and although we have nothing in the nature of an established church, that the untrammelled affirmations of religious belief and its propagation, personal or institutional, remain as of the greatest constitutional significance throughout the Dominion is unquestionable.\nThis is confirmed by a consideration of legislative powers conferred by the same statutes. By sec. 12 of the Quebec Act, the legislative council, with the consent of the gov\u00adernor, could make ordnances, generally, for the \"peace, wel\u00adfare and good government\" of the province. By sec. 8, the Canadian subjects were to hold their property and pos\u00adsessions \"together with all customs and usages relating thereto and all other their civil rights\" as before the capit\u00adulation so far as they might be consistent with their new allegiance; and in all matters of controversy relating to property and civil rights \"resort should be had to the laws of Canada\" as the rule for decision. By sec. 11 the criminal law of England was to be administered. The change of sovereignty had necessarily brought with it the public law of England, and so far as its provisions might conflict with the local laws and usages they would prevail.\nIn 1852, cap. 175 of 14-15 Viet. (Canada) was with the specified assent of Her Majesty enacted:\u2014\nWhereas the recognition of legal equality among all Religious Denomi\u00adnations is an admitted principle of Colonial Legislation; And whereas in the state and condition of this Province, to which such a principle is peculiarly applicable, it is desirable that the same should receive the sanction of direct Legislative Authority, recognizing and declaring the same as a fundamental principle of our civil polity: Be it therefore declared and enacted by the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council and of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, constituted and assembled by virtue .of and under the authority of an Act passed in the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and intituled, An Act to reunite the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, and for the Government of Canada, and it is hereby declared and enacted by the authority of the saine, That the free exercise and enjoyment of Religious Profession and Worship, without discrimination or preference, so as the same be not made an, excuse for acts of licentiousness, or a justification of practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the Province, is by the constitution and laws of this Province allowed to all Her Majesty's subjects within the same.\nThat law is now embodied in cap. 307, sec. 2 of R.S.Q. 1941.\nBy cap. 118 of the Imperial Statutes of 1854, sec. 42 of the Act of Union, 1840, was repealed and it was provided that the Governor might, in Her Majesty's name, assent to any bill of the Legislature of Canada or for Her Majesty to assent to any such bill reserved for the signification of Her pleasure, although the bill should not have been laid before the Houses of Parliament.\nFinally, the Confederation Act of 1867 effected a distrib\u00adution of legislative power for the \"peace, order and good government of Canada\" between the Dominion and the provinces. Sec. 6 of cap. 118, 1854, remains unrepealed save by the effect upon it of that Act: and it would appear that its provisions for assent and reservation are incom\u00adpatible with the provincial status. The only powers given by sec. 92 of the Confederation Act which have been suggested to extend to legislation in relation to religion are nos. 13, Property and Civil Rights, and 16, Matters of a merely local or private nature in the province. The statutory history of the expression \"Prop\u00aderty and Civil Rights\" already given exhibiting its parallel enactment with special provisions relating to religion shows indubitably that such matters as religious belief, duty and observances were never intended to be included within that collocation of powers. If it had not been so, the exceptional safeguards to Roman Catholics would have been redundant.\nStrictly speaking, civil rights arise from positive law; but freedom .of speech, religion and the inviolability of the person, are original freedoms which are at once the necessary attributes and modes of self-expression of human beings and the primary conditions of their community life within a legal order. It is in the circumscription of these liberties by the creation of civil rights in persons who may be injured by their exercise, and by the sanctions of public law, that the positive law operates. What we realize is the residue inside that periphery. Their significant relation to our law lies in this, that under its principles to which there are only minor exceptions, there is no prior or antecedent restraint placed upon them: the penalties, civil or criminal, attach to results which their exercise may bring about, and apply as consequential incidents. So we have the civil rights against defamation, assault, false imprisonment and the like, and the punishments of the criminal law; but the sanctions of the latter lie within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion. Civil rights of the same nature arise also as protection against infringements of these freedoms.\nThat legislation \"in relation\" to religion and its profes\u00adsion is not a local or private matter would seem to me to be self-evident: the dimensions of this interest are nationwide; it is even today embodied in the highest level of the con\u00adstitutionalism of Great Britain; it appertains to a boundless field of ideas, beliefs and faiths with the deepest roots and loyalties; a religious incident reverberates from one end of this country to the other, and there is nothing to which the \"body politic of the Dominion\" is more sensitive. There is, finally, the implication of sec. 93 of the Confederation, Act which deals with education. In this section appear the only references in the statute to religion. Sub-sec. (i) speaks of \"Denominational Schools\" and preserves their existing rights and privileges. Subsec. (ii) extends to the separate schools \"of the Queen's Protestant and Roman Catholic subjects\" in Quebec the same \"powers, privileges and duties\" then conferred and imposed upon the separate schools of the \"Queen's Roman Catholic subjects\" in Upper Canada. Subsec. (iii) provides for an appeal to the Gov\u00adernor-General in Council from any act or decision of a provincial authority \"affecting any right or privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's sub\u00adjects in relation to education\". Subsec. (iv) declares that in the event of any failure on the part of the provincial authority to observe or enforce the provincial laws contem\u00adplated by the section, Parliament may provide for the execution of the provisions of the section. On the argument advanced, and apart from the question of criminal law, these vital constitutional provisions could be written off by the simple expedient of abolishing, as civil rights and by provincial legislation, the religious freedoms of minorities, and so, in legal contemplation, the minorities themselves.\nSo is it with freedom of speech. The Confederation Act recites the desire of the three provinces to be federally united into one Dominion \"with a constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom. Under that constitution, government is by parliamentary institutions, including popular assemblies elected by the people at large in both provinces and Dominion: government resting ulti\u00admately on public opinion reached by discussion and the interplay of ideas. If that discussion is placed under license, its basic condition is destroyed: the government, as licensor, becomes disjoined from the citizenry. The only security is steadily advancing enlightenment, for which the widest range of controversy is the sine qua non.\nIn the Reference re The Accurate News and Information Act of Alberta[20], Sir Lyman Duff deals with this matter. The proposed legislation did not attempt to prevent dis\u00adcussion of affairs in newspapers but rather to compel the publication of statements as to the true and exact objects of governmental policy and as to the difficulties of achiev\u00ading them. Quoting the words of Lord Wright in James v. Commonwealth[21], that freedom of discussion means \"freedom governed by law\" he says at p. 133:\u2014\n\u2026 it is axiomatic that the practice of this right of free public discussion of public affairs, notwithstanding its incidental mischiefs, is the breath of life for parliamentary institutions.\nHe deduces authority to protect it from the principle that the powers requisite for the preservation of the constitu\u00adtion arise by a necessary implication of the Confederation Act as a whole. He proceeds:\u2014\nBut this by no means exhausts the matter. Any attempt to abrogate this right of public debate or to suppress the traditional forms of the exercise of the right (in public meeting and through the press) would, in our opinion, be incompetent to the legislatures of the provinces, or to the legislature of any one of the provinces, as repugnant to the provisions of The British North America Act, by which the Parliament of Canada is established as the legislative organ of the people of Canada under the Crown, and Dominion legislation enacted pursuant to the legislative authority given by those provisions. The subject matter of such legisla\u00adtion could not be described as a provincial matter purely; as in substance exclusively a matter of property and civil rights within the province, or a matter of private or local within the province. It would not be, o quote the words of the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King (1921) 2 A.C. 91, at 122, \"legislation directed solely to the purposes specified in section 92\"; and it would be invalid on the principles enunciated in that judgment and adopted in Caron v. The King (1924) A.C. 999, at 1005-06.\nConceding aspects of regulation of newspapers to be within provincial powers, he adds that\nin this region of constitutional practice, it is not permitted to a provincial legislature to do indirectly what cannot be done directly.\nCannon J. expressed similar views:\u2014\nFreedom of discussion is essential to enlighten public. opinion in a democratic State; it cannot be curtailed without affecting the right of the people to be informed through sources independent of the government concerning matters of public interest. There must be an untrammelled publication of the news and political opinions of the political parties contending for ascendancy. As stated in the preamble of The British North America Act, our constitution is and will remain, unless radically changed, \"similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom.\" At the time of Confederation, the United Kingdom was a democracy. Democracy cannot be maintained without its foundation: free public opinion and free discussion throughout the nation of all matters affecting the State within the limits set by the criminal code and the common law. What is proposed before us is that a newspaper, just as a. religious, political or other tract or handbill, for the purposes of sale or distribution through use of streets, can be placed under the uncontrolled discretion of a municipal officer; that is, that the province, While permitting all others, could forbid a newspapers or any writing of a par\u00adticular colour from being so disposed of. That public ways, in some circumstances the only practical means available for any appeal to the community generally, have from the most ancient times been the avenues for such communi\u00adcations, is demonstrated by the Bible itself: in the 6th verse of ch. xi of Jeremiah these words appear: \"Proclaim all these .words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem\"; and a more objectionable interference, short of complete suppression, with that dissemination which is the \"breath of life\" of the political institutions of this country than that made possible by the by-law can scarcely be imagined.\nBut it is argued that the by-law relates not to religion or free speech at all but to the administration of streets. Undoubtedly the city may pass regulations for that purpose but within the general and neutral requirement of license by the by-law a number of equally plausible objects may be conjectured. No purpose whatever is indicated much less specified by the language; its sole effect is to create and vest in a functionary a power, to be exercised for any purpose or reason he sees fit, disclosed or undisclosed. The only practice actually followed is not remotely connected with street regulation: matters of traffic interference, of nuisance, of cleanliness or anything of like character would be within the city's authority, but these are no more to be inferred than others. A suggested possible purpose is to deal with writings that might provoke breaches of the peace by persons who dislike what they contain, but the same observation applies: that matter or purpose is not prescribed, and, assuming it to be within the provincial purview, on which I express no opinion, it would be only one of a number of objects of equal speculative inclusion within the enactment, some of which relate to matters beyond provincial powers. The alternatives of interpretation are whether of that group of objects, one being valid the by-law in its entirety is valid, or whether one being invalid, the by-law in its entirety falls; or shortly, can legislation embracing such a combination of unspecified possibilities be upheld?\nIt was urged by Mr. Beaulieu that the city as proprietor of the streets has authority to forbid or permit as it chooses, in the most unlimited and arbitrary manner, any action or conduct that takes place on them. The possibilities of such a proposition can be easily imagined. But it misconceives the relation of the province to the public highways. The public entitled to use them is that of the Dominion, whose citizens are not of this or that province but of Canada. What has been confided to the provinces is the regulation .of their use by that public.\nConceding, as in the Alberta Reference, that aspects of the activities of religion and free speech may be affected by provincial legislation, such legislation, as in all other fields, must be sufficiently definite and precise to indicate its subject matter. In our political organization, as in federal structures generally, that is the condition of legislation by any authority within it: the courts must be able from its language and its relevant circumstances, to attribute an enactment to a matter in relation to which the legislature acting has been empowered to make laws. That principle inheres in the nature of federalism; otherwise, authority, in broad and general terms, could be conferred which would 'end the division of powers. Where the language is sufficiently specific and can fairly be interpreted as applying only to matter within the enacting jurisdiction, that attrib\u00adution will be made; and where the requisite elements are present, there is the rule of severability. But to authorize action which may be related indifferently to a variety of incompatible matters by means of the device of a discre\u00adtionary license cannot be brought within either of these mechanisms; and the Court is powerless, under general language that overlaps exclusive jurisdictions, to delineate and preserve valid power in a segregated form. If the purpose is street regulation, taxation, registration or other local object, the language must, with sufficient precision, define the matter and mode of administration; and by no expedient which ignores that requirement can constitutional limitations be circumvented. I would, therefore, allow the appeal, direct judgment declaring the by-law invalid, and enjoin the respondent City from acting upon it. The costs will be as proposed by my brother Kerwin.\nKELLOCK J. :\u2014This appeal arises out of an action brought by the appellant against the respondent city, the Attorney General for the province intervening, for a declaration that a by-law, No. 184, of the city, passed October 27, 1933, as well as the provincial legislation constituting the city charter in so far as such legislation may be said to authorize the said by-law, are ultra vires. The appellant contends that the said legislation and by-law are neither of them within any of the classes of matters assigned by section 92 to the legislatures of the provinces, but that their subject matter lies exclusively within the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament under section 91. The appellant invokes the provisions of the pre-Confederation statute of 1852, 14-15 Victoria, Ch. 175, which provides for religious freedom throughout the then province of Canada. This statute was continued in force by section 129 of the British North America Act and has never been repealed.\nThe appellant, .a member of the sect or denomination \"Jehovah's Witnesses\", alleges that the right to preach the Christian Gospel both orally and by means of the distribu\u00adtion of printed matter is secured to him by the terms of the statute of 1852 equally with all other religious denomina\u00adtions. Appellant alleges that in so doing by this latter means, he has been illegally arrested and imprisoned under the said by-law at the instance of the respondent and that an additional charge is pending against him thereunder.\nIn his declaration the appellant also attacked the by-law upon the ground that the delegation of the power of licens\u00ading therein contained was incompetent to the city council, but the appellant does not wish to argue this contention in this court.\nThe learned trial judge considered the by-law in question to be a mere \"police\" regulation, having to do with the maintenance of order and good government in the city and accordingly within the general powers granted by the city charter. The learned judge did not amplify this statement. The Court of Appeal[22] dismissed the appeal, Bertrand J., dissenting. Marchand J., did not, so far as the record shows, deliver any reasons. Pratte J., considered the by-law as one relating only to the \"use of streets\", a subject-matter of legislation he 'considered to be entirely within provincial jurisdiction. The learned judge also con\u00adsidered that the by-law did not trench upon such an exclu\u00adsive mater of legislative jurisdiction as criminal law.\nBarclay J., concurred generally with Pratte J. and he affirmed a statement he had made in an earlier decision, viz., \"I fail to see how a mere police regulation governing the distribution in the streets or public places\" of printed matter \"without previously obtaining a written permission is, per se, an attack upon the freedom of the press.\"\nHyde J. also agreed with Pratte J. The learned judge also referred to the Reference with respect to the Accurate News and Information Act of Alberta[23], and, in partic\u00adular, to the judgments of Duff J., as he then was, and of Cannon J., and distinguished the case at bar on the ground that the by-law in question was one dealing merely with the \"use of streets\".\nBertrand J., dissenting, considered the by-law to be in essence one of censorship, and as trenching upon the right of freedom of worship and profession. In his opinion the by-law was not within the city's charter, which does not mention such matters. The learned judge regarded the argument put forward on behalf of the respondent and the intervenant that the by-law was merely \"une simple mesure de protection contre l'encombrement des rues et place publiques\" as involving too great confidence on their pari in the naivet\u00e9 of the court. With respect to the construc\u00adtion of the Act of 1852, he was of opinion that the words \"mais de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne pas servir d'excuse \u00e0 des actes d'une licence effr\u00e9n\u00e9e, ni \u00e0 autoriser des pratiques incompatibles avec la paix et la s\u00fbret\u00e9 de la province\" had reference only to \"des actes criminels en soi ou tellement contraires aux moeurs des pays chr\u00e9tiens qu'ils puissent faire l'object de r\u00e8glements sp\u00e9ciaux pourvu toutefois qu'ils ne portent pas atteinte \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 des cultes.\" In this view, the learned judge did not consider it necessary to deal with the ques\u00adtion of the freedom of the press. Before this court the respondent seeks to support the by-law as legislation in relation to the \"use of streets\" or as police regulations with relation to public order, and reliance is placed upon section 92(8), (13) and (16) of the British North America Act.\nFor the appellant it is contended that the by-law is so wide in its terms that even if authorized by the relevant provisions of the city charter, both the by-law and the charter provisions are ultra vires as trenching upon freedom of religion, the subject-matter of the statute of 1852, and liberty of the press, both subject-matters of legislation, in the appellant's contention, exclusively within the jurisdiction of Parliament.\nThe question, therefore, which lies at the threshold of the case is as to the true nature and character of the by-law. Paragraph 1 reads as follows:\nIt is, by the present by-law, forbidden to distribute in the streets of the City of Quebec, any book, pamphlet, booklet, circular, tract whatever without having previously obtained for so doing the written permission of the Chief of Police.\nParagraph 2 provides a penalty for distribution without license.\nIt will be observed that the by-law is perfectly general in its terms and that while it prohibits in the absence of a licence, at the same time it contemplates, fully as much, distribution at the unfettered will of the municipal official to whom is delegated the power to grant or to refuse to grant licences. The by-law affords no guide whatever for the regulation from any standpoint of the prohibition or permission for which it provides. To borrow language used in another connection by Lord Watson in Union Colliery Company v. The Queen[24], \"the leading feature\" of this by-law consists in this that it establishes no rule or regula\u00adtion for its application except that nothing but that which is permitted by the censor may be distributed. What he permits will appear in the streets. What he refuses will not. The grant or refusal of a licence will depend upon the contents of the document proposed to be distributed and the will of the censor. To equate such a by-law to by-laws which are purely prohibitory is to lose sight of the real nature of the by-law here in question. This has largely contributed to the error into which the courts below have, in my opinion, fallen.\nCounsel not only for the respondent but for the intervenant as well, agree that such is the character of the by-law, and counsel for the respondent stated that it had been so administered by the respondent, its officers and servants. In so stating counsel has admitted nothing more than is clear from the record itself. A single illustration will suffice.\nIn case No. 51647 in the Superior Court, Saumur v. Recorder's Court, referred to by the respondent in its factum, the plaintiff was convicted under the by-law here in question. A writ of habeas corpus subsequently issued was quashed by the Superior Court, whose judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, Galipeault J., dissenting. In the course of his reasons, the learned judge of first instance, Boulanger J., in quashing the writ, said:\nJ'admets que le r\u00e8glement ,est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 en termes assez g\u00e9n\u00e9raux pour servir \u00e0 restreindre la libert\u00e9 de parole ou la libert\u00e9 de religion, ou la libert\u00e9 tout court quand cela devient n\u00e9cessaire comme mesure de police et quand la libert\u00e9 menace de tourner \u00e0 la licence et de compromettre la paix de la municipalit\u00e9.\nJ'admets aussi que les pourvoira donn\u00e9s au directeur de la police sont larges et qu'ils peuvent servir \u00e0 censurer des publications de caract\u00e8re religieux.\nI shall have something to say subsequently with respect to the limitation upon the exercise of the power given to the chief of police which the learned judge reads into the by-law. For the moment, I quote his language for the purpose of showing that the 'administration of the by-law is from the standpoint of the contents of the literature proposed to be distributed. Galipeault J. had this to say in the same case:\nComme on le voit, le savant juge Iui-m\u00eame (Boulanger J.) est d'avis que le r\u00e8glement dans sa r\u00e9daction comme dans sa substance quel que soit la but que la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec ait voulu obtenir, peut porter atteinte \"\u00e0 la libert\u00e9 de parole, ou la libert\u00e9 de religion, ou la libert\u00e9 tout court\" ...\nJ'estime que la l\u00e9gislation se rapportant aux droits ou \u00e0 libert\u00e9 de parole, de pens\u00e9e, de critique, de la presse en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, n'est pas du domaine de la l\u00e9gislature, mais rel\u00e8ve du Parlement du 'Canada qui, par son droit statutaire, le Code Criminel, a l\u00e9gif\u00e9r\u00e9 en la mati\u00e8re.\nThe learned judge reads the by-law as it is itself expressed, without any limitation whatever. Speaking for the majority of the court below, Pratte J., says:\nEn effet, il suffit seulement de songer ce que pourrait \u2026 r\u00e9sulter de la distribution \u00e0 tout venant d'\u00e9crits offensants pour les habi\u00adtants de la localit\u00e9; ou encore, au sort fait aux parents dont les enfants seraient sans cesse expos\u00e9s \u00e0 recevoir dans la rue des \u00e9crits susceptibles de troubler leur esprit, ou propageant des doctrines r\u00e9prouv\u00e9es par ceux qui ont non seulement le droit mais le devoir de veiller \u00e0 leur \u00e9ducation ...\nClearly, therefore, the by-law is not directed to the mere physical act involved in the handing to another of a document but has in view the contents of the document and the desirability or 'otherwise, in the view of the chief of police, as to its circulation. A document refused a licence would not involve anything more from the standpoint of obstruction of the highway or the impeding of those using it, than one with respect to which a licence is granted, and both documents, if discarded by the recipients, would equally be a source of litter. The by-law, however, is not concerned with such matters. Nothing more is needed, in my opinion, to discern the real nature and character of the by-law, namely, to provide that some material may reach the public using the streets, while the rest may not.\nBeing perfectly general in its terms and setting no standard by which the official it names is to be governed in granting or refusing licences, the by-law can be used, as it has been, to deny distribution of its literature to one religious denomination, while granting that liberty to another or others. The by-law is equally capable of being applied so as to permit distribution of 'the literature of one political party while denying that right to all others, or so as to refuse to allow the selling in the streets ,of some newspapers while permitting others. In any or all of these cases, the same physical acts would be involved 'occasioning the same degree of obstruction, if obstruction there would be. Nothing more is needed to demonstrate, in my opinion, that such a by-law was not enacted \"in relation to\" streets but in relation to the minds of the users of the streets.\nIf the by-law were one which prohibited all distribution in the streets, entirely different considerations would very well apply. It is a confusion of thought, in my opinion, to regard by-law 184 as in the same category with purely pro\u00adhibitive by-laws, as the intervenant seeks 'to do and as was done by the court below. Pratte J., for example, refers to In re Kruse[25]. The by-law in question in that case, however, provided that \"no person\" should play any musical instrument on a highway within a specified distance of a house after being requested by the occupant to desist. Entirely different considerations are applicable to such by-laws, and judgments with respect to 'them have no application, in my opinion, to a by-law such as No. 184, which is as much permissive as it is prohibitory.\nAssuming, for the purposes 'of argument, that the by-law here in question might, in actual administration by the official mentioned therein, be administered solely to prevent literature reaching the streets which might cause disturbance or nuisance therein, and that a by-law expressly so limited would be within provincial competence, the present by-law is not so limited in its terms. Its validity is not to be judged from the standpoint of matters to which it might be limited, but upon the completely general terms in which it in fact is couched.\nNo citation of authority is needed to establish the proposition that civil regulation of the use of highways is a matter within the jurisdiction of provincial legislatures, but there is a distinction between legislation \"in relation to\" a subject-matter within s. 92 and legislation which may have an effect upon such matters; Attorney General for Saskatchewan v. Attorney General for Canada[26], per Viscount Simon. It is only legislation \"in relation to\" matters within section 92 which is committed to the provincial legislatures.\nIn the judgment in the court below and in argument on behalf of the intervenant in this court, some relevance was found to the case at bar in the decision of this court in Provincial Secretary of Prince Edward Island v. Egan[27]. In that case it was held that a provincial statute providing for suspension of a licence to drive a motor car upon con\u00adviction under section 285(4) of the Criminal Code of driv\u00ading while intoxicated, was valid. In my opinion it would be impossible to draw any analogy between the provincial legislation there in question and legislation such as by-law No. 184. It would scarcely be argued that the decision in Egan's case would afford any ground of support for pro\u00advincial legislation which sought to make the grant or refusal of a licence to operate a motor car on a highway dependent upon the religious denomination to which the driver belonged or the sectarian character of the literature carried in the vehicle. Such legislation would not be legis\u00adlation in relation to highways at all, although no doubt it would affect traffic seeking to use the highways. There can be no question but that the legislation in question in Egan's case was \"in relation to\" highways and safety on the highways. Legislation which is concerned not primarily with highways at all but with other subjects must depend for its validity upon the legislative competence of the legis\u00adlature with respect to such subjects.\nThere is equally no analogy, in my opinion, between a by-law restricting a designated area in a municipality to private residences, for example, and one which would exclude from such a designated area buildings erected by one religious denomination. By-laws of the former character, being purely prohibitory, are usually recognized as valid provincial legislation, but they would be in an entirely different category from the latter, if it could be conceived that a by-law of the latter type would be enacted. Refer\u00adence may be made to Toronto v. Roman Catholic Separate Schools Trustees[28], per Viscount Cave L.C.\nThe same may be said of the type of by-law in question in In re Cribbin and the City of Toronto[29], which pro\u00advided that\nNo person shall on the Sabbath Day, in any public park in the City of Toronto publicly preach, lecture or declaim.\nHad the by-law there in question been expressed to be applicable to persons of a particular religious persuasion only, entirely different considerations would have applied to the question of its constitutional validity.\nBedard v. Dawson[30], is also relied upon by the intervenant. Again it is to be observed that the legislation there in question provided that\nIt shall be illegal for any person who owns or occupies any house or building ... to use or allow any person to use the same as a disorderly house. It is perfectly true, as stated by Duff J., as he then was, at p. 685, that\nThe legislation impugned seems to be aimed at suppressing conditions calculated to favour the development of crime rather than at the punishment of crime. This is an aspect of the subject in respect of which the provinces seem to be free to legislate.\nIf, however, the legislation there under consideration had been operative so as to interfere with rights which are not the subject of legislative jurisdiction under s. 92, other con\u00adsiderations would have applied. The question in the case at bar is as to whether by-law 184 impinges upon such matters.\nThis brings me to the first ground upon which the by-law is attacked, namely, the rights granted by the Act of 1852. That statute, so far .as material, is as follows:\nWhereas the recognition of legal equality among all Religious Denominations is an admitted principle of Colonial Legislation; And whereas in the state and condition of this Province, to which such a principle is peculiarly applicable, it is desirable that the same should receive the sanction of direct Legislative Authority, recognizing and declaring the same as a fundamental principle of our civil policy: Be it therefore declared and enacted by the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council and of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada ... That the free exercise and enjoyment of Religious Profession and Worship, without discrimination or preference, so as the same be not made an excuse for acts of licentiousness, or a justification of practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the Province, is by the constitution and laws of this Province allowed to all Her Majesty's subjects within the same.\nThe respondent strenuously argued that the Jehovah's Witnesses were not entitled to rely upon the Act as they were not a \"religious denomination\" within the meaning of the statute. It was further contended that because the appellant had refused to apply for a licence under the by-law before bringing the present action, this amounted to an \"act of licentiousness\" or a \"practice inconsistent with the peace and safety of the province\" within the meaning of the statute. With respect I am of opinion that neither con\u00adtention is tenable. So far as the second is concerned, in my opinion, the language of the statute has no effect beyond removing protection from particular \"acts\" or \"practices\" which are in themselves illegal by the common or statute law. The statute does not mean, for instance, that if a sect practises polygamy, it becomes disentitled to rely on the statute for all purposes. It merely means that the statute affords no defence to polygamy. The same would apply in the case of any literature circulated by the appellant or those associated with him.\nMr. Beaulieu argues that \"the free exercise and enjoyment of Religious Profession and Worship\" in the statute do not cover more than the carrying on of religious exercise in some place of worship. In that view the statute would have nothing to say with regard to such a matter, for example, as the dissemination of religious views or material, e.g., the Scriptures themselves, outside such places of worship.\nI do not think the statute is to be so narrowly construed. It recites that \"the recognition of legal 'equality among all Religious Denominations\" was an admitted principle of colonial legislation and that it was desirable that that principle should receive legislative sanction \"as a funda\u00admental principle of our civil polity\". By sec. V of the Act of 1774 it was \"the free exercise of the Religion of the Church of Rome\" which was granted. The principle of legal equality provided for by the Act of 1852 can mean no less than this. I would adopt the language of the writer in Volume II, \"La Revue Critique\", p. 130, where he says:\nFrom this principle of our public law flow the rights and liberties which are dearest to our mixed population; liberty of conscience, freedom of public worship and freedom of the press in religious matters .... Every person has a right to speak, write and print his opinion upon any religious question or point of controversy, without permission from the government or from any one else.\nThe Christian religion would hardly have survived had it permitted itself 'to be circumscribed in accordance with the argument of Mr. Beaulieu. From the beginning it has propagated itself by the written as well as the spoken word. The Scriptures themselves are a sufficient illustration of this. That propagation by such means was not, however, limited to the Scriptures is a matter of common knowledge. This is conveniently illustrated by the Canadian Act of 1843, 7 Victoria, c. 68: \"An Act to Incorporate the Church Societies of the United Church of England and Ireland in the Dioceses of Quebec and Toronto.\" By the preamble one of the purposes of incorporation was \"for circulating in the said Dioceses, respectively, the Holy Scriptures, the Book of Common Prayer of the said Church, and such other Books and Tracts, as shall be approved by the Several Central Boards or Managing Committee.\"\nIt is undoubted that, under a by-law of the nature of by-law 184, the circulation of such material as the above would be impossible except with permission of the censor. This aspect of religious freedom would thereby be inter\u00adfered with. The question is, therefore, 'as to the competency of provincial legislation in this field. In support of the by-law, it is said that this is a subject matter within the category of \"civil rights in the province.\"\nIn considering this contention certain historical matters are relevant. Under the Quebec Act of 1774, 14 Geo. III, c. 83, provision is made for the government of the Province of Canada, which included, inter alia, all of the present provinces of Ontario and Quebec. By section VIII it is provided that all His Majesty's Canadian subjects within the province, with the exception of religious orders and communities, might hold and enjoy \"their Property and Possession, together with all Customs and Usages relative thereto, and all other their Civil Rights, in as large, ample and beneficial Manner\" as if certain previously made pro\u00adclamations, etc., had not been made. And it was further provided that in all matters of controversy \"relative to Property and Civil Rights\" resort should be had to the laws of Canada as the rule for decision of the same and that all causes which might 'thereafter be instituted in any of the courts of justice 'should, with respect to \"such Property and Rights\" be determined agreeably to the said laws and customs of Canada until varied' by subsequent enactment.\nIt is plain from other provisions of the statute that \"Property and Civil Rights\" do not include the right of exercise and profession of religion, as to which express provision was made elsewhere.\nBy section V it is enacted\nThat his Majesty's Subjects, professing the Religion of the Church of Rome of and in the said Province of Quebec, may have, hold, and enjoy, the free Exercise of the Religion of the Church of Rome, subject to the King's supremacy, declared and established by .an Act, made in the first year of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth .... and that the Clergy of the said Church may hold, receive, and enjoy, their accustomed Dues and Rights, with respect to such Persons only as shall profess the said Religion. Section VI enacts that\nProvided nevertheless, That it shall be lawful for his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, to make such Provision out of the rest of the said accustomed Dues and Rights, for the Encouragement of the Protestant Religion, and for the Maintenance and Support of a Protestant, Clergy within the said Province, as he or they shall, from Time to Time, think necessary and expedient.\nSection XII provides for the government of the province by a council, but Section XV provides that \"no Ordinance touching Religion ... .\" is to be of any force or effect until the same shall have received the approval of His Majesty. Section XI confirms English criminal law 'as the law of the province.\nBy section XVII provision is made for \"Courts of Civil, Criminal and Ecclesiastical\" jurisdiction.\nIn 1791 the Constitutional Act, 31 Geo. III, c. 31, was passed. This statute provided for the division of the province into two separate provinces of Upper 'and Lower Canada, and for a separate legislative council and assembly for each, with power to make laws for the peace, welfare and good government 'of each of the provinces. All laws previously existing were to continue until repealed or varied under the authority 'of the Act.\nSection XLII provided, however, that with respect to any Act or Acts which might be passed by the legislative coun\u00adcil or assembly of either of the provinces varying or repeal\u00ading the matters covered by Sections V and VI of the Act of 1774 or which \"shall in any Manner relate to or affect the Enjoyment or Exercise of any religious Form or Mode of Worship; or shall impose or create any Penalties, Burthens, Disabilities, or Disqualifications in respect of the same\" or should affect the enjoyment of the dues or rights of any \"Minister, Priest, Ecclesiastic, or Teacher, according to any religious Form or Mode of Worship in respect of his said Office or Function\" should, before assent should be given to it, be laid before both Houses of Parliament in Great Britain, and His Majesty was prohibited from assenting to any such Act in case either House within thirty days should present an address to His Majesty to withhold assent therefrom. In 1792, by 32 Geo. III, c. I, the Legislature of Upper Canada, after reciting the provision in the Imperial Act of 1774 providing \"that in all matters of controversy relative to Property and Civil Rights, resort should be had to the laws of Canada, as the rule for the decision .of the same\", and that that part of the former Province of Quebec then included within Upper Canada having become inhabited principally by persons familiar with the laws of England, this provision was repealed and it was enacted by Sec\u00adtion III that \"from and after the passing of this Act, in all matters of controversy relative to Property and Civil Rights, resort shall be had to the Laws of England, as the rule for the decision of the same.\" Section VI, however, expressly provided that nothing in the statute should vary or interfere or be construed to vary or interfere, with any \"of the subsisting provisions respecting Ecclesiastical rights or dues within this Province.\"\nIn 1840, by 3-4 Victoria, c. 35, the two provinces were reunited under one legislative council and assembly. Sec\u00adtion XLII again provided that whenever any bill should be passed containing any provisions\nwhich shall in any Manner relate to or affect the Enjoyment or Exercise of any Form or Mode of Religious Worship, or shall impose or create any Penalties, Burdens, Disabilities, or Disqualifications, in respect of the same,\nevery such bill, prior to assent, should be laid before both Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and within thirty days thereof, in case either House of Parliament should address Her Majesty to withhold Her assent from any such bill, it should not be lawful for Her Majesty to signify Her assent. This section was altered in 1854, by 17-18 Vic., c. 118, s. 6, empowering the Governor to give the Queen's assent.\nIn the meantime, the Act of 1852, c. 175, was passed by the local legislature in 1851 and, as required by the statute of 1840, was assented to by Her Majesty at Westminster on May 15, 1852.\nIt would therefore appear plain from all this legislation that, commencing with the statute of 1774, the phrase \"property and civil rights\" did not include the right to the exercise and enjoyment of religious profession, that being a matter the subject of special provision in each case, and, by the statute of 1852, made a fundamental principle of the constitution of the entire country.\nIt is, of course, well settled that the right to hold any view in matters of religious belief is not a civil right at all except in relation to title to property. In Forbes v. Eden[31], the appellant, a clergyman of the Episcopal Church of Scotland, brought action for a declaration that it was ultra vires of the church to amend its canons and that he was entitled to celebrate Divine Worship and to administer the sacraments and other rites of the church in accordance with the original canons. The appellant had not been deprived of his status and had sustained no damage. The respondents, in their defence, relied upon the principle that courts of civil jurisdiction will not take cognizance of questions as to religious doctrine or discipline except for the purpose of enforcing \"civil rights\" or redressing \"civil wrongs\".\nThe following from the opinions of members of the House are sufficient :\nLord Chelmsford L.C. .at 573:\nThe Court had therefore, o consider whether it could properly entertain the question of the reduction of the canons upon the ground that they were a departure from the doctrine and discipline of the Scotch Episcopal Church at the time the appellant became its minister. Now this it refused to do, as it was a mere abstract question involving religious dogmas, and resulting in no civil consequences which could justify the interposition of a Civil Court.\nLord Colonsay, 588:\nA Court of Law will not interfere with the rules of a voluntary association unless to protect some civil right or interest which is said to be infringed by their operation. Least of all will it enter into questions of disputed doctrine, when not necessary to do so in reference to civil interests.\nThe same principle underlies the decision in the Free Church case[32] ; see the judgment of Lord James of Hereford at p. 655.\nThis principle was well understood in Canada before 1867. In 1857, by the statute 20 Victoria, c. 43, provision was made for the appointment of commissioners to reduce into one code \"those provisions of the laws of Lower Canada which relate to civil matters and are of a general and per\u00admanent character.\" In their second report, dated May 22, 1860, the majority of the commissioners, in discussing the scope of their terms of reference, refer to a disagreement among the commissioners on this point.\nAt page 149 of Vol. I, the majority say:\nOn one hand, it is pretended that the laws to be codified are exclusively those upon which the provincial parliament has the right to legislate, and therefore that all those which proceed from or make part of the imperial laws should be omitted. On the other hand it is pretended that the codification required should extend to all classes of categories of laws in force in the province, provided they refer to civil matters, from whatever source they come, and that the objection would only be valid in case it should be proposed to repeal or alter these laws, which has never been contemplated; but is without force, for a case like the present, where it is only intended to announce their existence.\nThe latter view was that of the majority and, while the draft code in its first title\" is concerned with the enjoyment and loss of \"civil rights\", it does not deal with the subject matter of the Act of 1852, although it does deal with the loss of civil rights occasioned by the taking of religious vows upon entry into a religious order. The majority view was adopted by the legislature in the code of 1866, the rele\u00advant provisions being found in Articles 18, 30 and 34 of the first title.\nIn speaking of the loss of civil rights consequent upon the taking of religious vows, the majority say also, at page 153:\nOne of the Commissioners is, however, of opinion that the religious profession no longer exists legally in this province, at least so as to produce civil death; that the cession of the country has 'abolished it, by putting an end to the state of things upon which its existence depended; that, moreover, it is contrary to the laws of public order and incompatible with certain civil and religious rights pertaining equally to all classes of the population. For these reasons set forth in the special report already mentioned, the present article 20 and the second paragraph of article 17 are only adopted by two of the Commissioners.\nThey are of opinion that whatever may have been the principle, the origin and the source of the laws on this subject, to establish that it is in force in this country, it is only necessary to show that it was admitted and put into 'execution in France, until its abolition in 1789, as forming part of the civil laws; that as such it was introduced into Canada at its settlement. and that since it has been constantly followed and practised as well before as since the cession of the country, which, far from abolish\u00ading it by implication or otherwise, has, on the contrary, given rise to treaties and legislative provisions, which by granting to the inhabitants of the country the free exercise of their religion and the enjoyment of their civil laws, have thereby confirmed and continued the existence of the law in question, which makes part of the one and is intimately con\u00adnected with the other. In the view of the codifiers, therefore, and in that of the legislature, freedom of worship and profession was not a \"civil right\" and certainly nota civil right \"within\" the province of Lower Canada.\nIt has been decided by the Judicial Committee that \"Property and Civil Rights\" in the Act of 1774, although \"used in their largest sense\" have exactly the same meaning in the statute of 1867; Citizens Insurance Company v. Parsons[33], per Sir Montague Smith. Section 94 of 1867 authorizes Parliament to make provision for the uniformity of all or any of the laws relative to \"property and civil rights\" in Ontario, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick with the consent of those provinces.\nAs pointed out in the Parsons case, at page 110:\nThe Province of Quebec is omitted from this section for the obvious reason that the law which governs property and civil rights in Quebec is in the main the French law as it existed at the time of the cession of Canada, and not the English law which prevails in the other provinces.\nIt is equally obvious that so far as the law relating to freedom of worship and profession is concerned, that law was not the French law but rather the statute of 1852, which applied equally to both of the Canadas.\nMr. Justice Mignault in Volume I has the following at p. 131:\nLes droits sont les facult\u00e9s ou avantages que les lois accordent aux personnes. Ils sont civils, politiques ou publics\nCertains droits existent qui, \u00e0 proprement parler, ne sont ni civils ni politiques; tels sont les droits de s'associer, de s'assembler paisiblement et sans armes, de p\u00e9titionner, de manifester sa pens\u00e9e par la voie de la presse ou autrement, la libert\u00e9 individuelle et enfin la libert\u00e9 de conscience. Ces droits ne sont point des droits civils, car ils ne cone stituent point des rapports de particulier \u00e0 particulier; ce ne sont pas non plus de v\u00e9ritables droits politiques, puisqu'on les exerce sans prendre aucune part au gouvernement du pays. Quelques personnes les rangent dans une classe particuli\u00e8re sous la d\u00e9nomination de droits publics.\n\"I consider\" says Lord Bacon, \"that it is a true and received division of law into ius publicum and ius privatum, the one being the sinews of property, and the other of government.\" See Holland, \"Jurispurdence\" 13th ed. p. 366. The same learned author places\n\"the relation, if any, between church and state\" as in the realm of constitutional law, which is, of course, a branch of public law. Pagnuelo, in his work \"de la Libert\u00e9 Religieuse en Canada\" treats the subject-matter of the Act of 1852 (cor\u00adrectly in my opinion) as within this field. At p. 257 the learned author says:\nCependant le droit public s'etablissait dans le pays, et finalement la l\u00e9gislature Bas-Canadienne, anticipant les d\u00e9cisions des premiers juges et l\u00e9gistes d'Angleterre, d\u00e9clarait en 1851 par la seule force de la conscience intime de l'\u00e9tat social de la colonie, quels sont les principes de notre constitution politique quant aux affaires religieuses.\nSimilarly, the writer in La Revue Critique Vol. II, which I have already quoted in part, says at p. 130:\nTo sum up the discussion, it may confidently be concluded that it is a fundamental maxim of law in. Canada, consecrated both by the French and the British constitutions of the country, by imperial statutes and treaties, by the peculiar jurisdiction and by repeated decisions of our counts, that all the churches in the colony are free and independent of civil or judicial intervention in spiritual matters.\nFrom this principle of our public law flow the rights and liberties which are dearest to our mixed population: liberty of conscience, freedom of public worship and freedom of the press in religious matters.\nGalipeault J., also, in Saumur v. la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec[34], in referring to the subject-matter of the very by-law here in question, says, (and in my opinion, with respect, perfectly correctly)\nEt il convient de nous rappeler que nous sommes ici en mati\u00e8re de droit public plut\u00f4t qu'en mati\u00e8re de droit.\nAny contention that the right to the exercise of religion is a mere \"civil right\" is, therefore, for 'these reasons, quite untenable in my opinion. Even if such a matter could be so regarded, it would not be a civil right \"within the province\".\nThe British North America Act itself indicates, in my opinion, that the subject-matter of religious profession is not a matter of provincial legislative jurisdiction within any of the heads of s. 92.\nBy s. 93 it is enacted that a provincial legislature may legislate \"in relation to\" education but subject, inter alia, to the provision that\n(1) Nothing in any such Law shall prejudicially affect any Right or Privilege with respect to Denominational Schools which any Class of Persons have by Law in the Province at the Union. The \"class\" in s-s. (1) must, as stated by the Judicial Committee in Ottawa Separate Schools v. Mackell[35], be a class determined \"according to religious belief\". The right or privilege preserved by s-s. (1) 'to such a class with respect to its denominational schools is such only as existed \"by law\" at the time .of Union. It would in my opinion be absurd to say that a provincial legislature, while it cannot strike at the right of any such class to impart religious instruction to its adherents, may nevertheless legislate so as to affect or destroy the religious faith of the denomina\u00adtion and thus affect or entirely do away with all necessity for religious instruction in that faith.\nS-ss. (3) and (4) of s. 93 provide that\n(3) Where in any Province a System of Separate or Dissentient Schools exists by Law at the Union or is thereafter established by the Legislature of the Province, an Appeal shall lie to the Governor General in Council from any Act or Decision of any Provincial Authority affect\u00ading any Right or Privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic Minority of the Queen's Subjects in relation to Education:\n(4) In case any such Provincial Law as from Time to Time seems to the Governor General in Council requisite for the due Execution of the Provisions of this Section is not made, or in case any Decision of the Governor General in Council on any Appeal under this Section is not duly executed by the proper Provincial Authority in that Behalf, then and in every such Case, and as far only as the Circumstances of each Case require, the Parliament of Canada may make remedial Laws for the due execution of the Provisions of this Section and of any Decision of the Governor General in Council under this Section.\nIn Roman Catholic Separate School Trustees v. The King[36], Viscount Haldane said:\nTheir Lordships are of opinion that where the head of the executive council in Canada is satisfied that injustice has been done by taking away a right or privilege which is other than a legal one from the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority in relation to education, he may interfere. The step is one from mere legality to administrative propriety, a totally different matter. But it may be that those who had to find a new constitution for Canada when the British North America Act was passed in 1867, came to the conclusion that a very difficult situation could be met in no other way than by transferring the question from the region of legality to that of administrative fairness.\nAccordingly, even though its legislation in matters of education may be intra vires, a provincial legislature may be restrained by the federal executive if, in the view of the latter, its intervention is called for within the terms of s. 93. It can hardly be that although the express power of the provincial legislatures as to education is thus restricted where matters of religious belief are involved, there none\u00adtheless exists a jurisdiction under some head of s. 92 to legislate as to matters of religious profession and worship itself which could, conceivably, reduce s-ss. (3) and (4) to a dead letter. In my view any such view is untenable.\nI therefore conclude that it is incompetent for a pro\u00advincial legislature to legislate with respect to the subject-matter of the statute of 1852 and that by-law 184, couched as it is in general terms, purports to interfere with the rights granted by the statute, and is consequently ultra vires.\nI have not overlooked that the Legislatures of Ontario and Quebec have, since Confederation, purported to re-enact the statute of 1852. The question of the competency of this legislation has, however, so far as I am aware, not been previously judicially considered. No doubt the provi\u00adsions of the 1852 statute relating to rectories were matters of provincial legislative jurisdiction.\nThere are other standpoints also from which the by-law is equally invalid. In so far as the by-law may be said to have in view the prohibition of the publication of blas\u00adphemous libel, it would be clearly outside the comptence of a provincial legislature as impinging upon the criminal law. As pointed out by Lord Parker in Bowman v. Secular Society Limited[37] :\nIn my opinion to constitute blasphemy at common law there must be such an element of vilification, ridicule, or irreverence as would be likely to exasperate the feelings of others and so lead to a breach of the peace. I cannot find that the common law has ever concerned itself with opinion as such, or with expression of opinion, so far as such expression is compatible with the maintenance of public order. Indeed there is express authority that heresy as such is outside the cognizance of a criminal Court unless the heretic by setting up conventicles or otherwise endangers the peace: see Hawkins' pleas of the Crown, vol. 1, p. 354.\nAgain, at page 451, Lord Parker adopted the language of Coleridge J. in Shore v. Wilson[38], as follows:\nThere is nothing unlawful at common law in reverently doubting or denying doctrines parcel of Christianity, however fundamental. It would be difficult to draw a line in such matters according to perfect orthodoxy, or to define how far one might depart from it in believing or teaching without offending the law. The only safe, and, as it seems to me, practical rule, is that which I have pointed at, and which depends on the sobriety and reverence and seriousness with which the teaching, or believing, however erroneous, are maintained. The offence of blasphemy is, of course, expressly covered by section 198 of the Criminal Code.\nAgain, in so far as the by-law may be said to be directed at seditious literature,\nnothing short of direct incitement to disorder and violence is a seditious libel;\nRex v. Aldred [39], per Coleridge J.\nLower down on the same page the learned judge said:\nThe test is this: was the language used calculated, or was it not, to promote public disorder or physical force or violence in a matter of state.\nThe same result obtains in so far as the by-law could be said to be directed against the publication of libelous matter regarded from the standpoint of public law. Libel in its aspect other than as giving rise to an action for damages as at the instance of the person defamed, is a crime. Odgers, Sixth Edition, at page 7, has the following: \"A libel is a crime: a slander on a private individual is not.\" On the same page the authors refer to the judgment of Lush J., in R. v. Holbrook[40], as follows:\nLibel on an individual is, and has always been, regarded as both a civil injury and a criminal offence \u2026 It is ranked amongst criminal offences because of its supposed tendency to arouse angry passion, provoke revenge, and thus endanger the public peace\nHowever this may be, the by-law is not limited in terms to such matters but .extends to all matters to which the censor may see fit to apply it. As it is capable of applica\u00adtion to matters beyond the ambit, of s. 92, it must be held to be invalid.\nIn the Reference re the Alberta Accurate News and Information Act[41], there was in question a bill the rele\u00advant provisions of which, for present purposes, imposed upon those concerned in the publication of newspapers in the province, at the direction of the chairman of a pro\u00advincial board, the obligation of publishing statements fur\u00adnished by him having for their object the correction or amplification of any statement relating to any policy or activity of the government of the province which had already been published by the newspaper concerned, and requiring the newspaper to make returns setting out every source from which any information had emanated with respect to any statement contained in the newspaper, and the names, addresses and occupations of all persons by whom such information had been furnished as well as the name and address of the writer of any editorial, article or news item.\nThree members of this court dealt with this legislation from a standpoint which is relevant to the case at bar. Duff, C.J., with whom Davis J., agreed, after referring to the provisions of the British North America Act relating to the Senate and the House of Commons, said at page 133:\nThe preamble of the statute, moreover, shows plainly enough that the constitution of the Dominion is to be similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom. The statute contemplates a Parliament working under the influence of public opinion and public discussion. There can be no controversy that such institutions derive their efficacy from the free pub\u00adlic discussion of affairs, from criticism and answer and counter-criticism, from attack upon policy and administration and defence and counter-attack; from the freest and fullest analysis and examination from every point of view of political proposals\nThe right of public discussion is, of course, subject to legal restrictions; those based upon considerations of decency and public order, and others conceived for the protection of various private and public interests with which, for example, the laws of defamation and sedition are concerned. In a word, freedom of discussion means, to quote the words of Lord Wright in James v. Commonwealth, (1936) A.C. 578, at 627, \"freedom governed by law\".\nEven within its legal limits, it is liable to abuse and grave abuse, and such abuse is constantly exemplified before our eyes; but it is axiomatic that the practice of this right, of free public discussion of public affairs, notwithstanding its incidental mischiefs, is the breath of life for parlia\u00admentary institutions.\nWe do not doubt that (in addition to the power of disallowance vested in the Governor General) the Parliament of Canada possesses authority .to legislate for the protection of this right. That authority rests upon the principle that the powers requisite for the protection of the constitution itself arise by necessary implication from The British North America Act as a whole (Fort Frances Pulp & Power Co. Ltd. v. Manitoba Free Press Co. Ltd. (1923) AC. 695); and since the subject-matter in relation to which the power is exercised is not exclusively a provincial matter, it is necessarily vested in Parliament.\nBut this by no means exhausts the matter. Any attempt to abrogate this right of public debate or to suppress the traditional forms of the exercise of the right (in public meeting and through the press) would, in our opinion be incompetent to the legislatures of the provinces, or to the legislature of any one of the provinces, as repugnant to the provisions of The British North America Act, by which the Parliament of Canada is established as the legislative organ of the people of Canada under the Crown, and Dominion legislation enacted pursuant to the legislative authority given by those provisions. The subject-matter of such legisla\u00adtion could not be described as a provincial matter purely; as in substance exclusively a matter of property and civil rights within the province, or a matter private or local within the province. It would not be, to quote the words of the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King, (1921) 2 A.C. 91, at 122, \"legislation directed solely to the purposes specified in section 92\"; and it would be invalid on the principles enunciated in that judgment and adopted in Caron v. The King, (1924) A.C. 999, at 1005-06.\nThe learned Chief Justice then referred to the question as to the validity of the legislation before the Court, con\u00adsidered as an independent enactment with no relation to the other provincial legislation there in question and, conceding that 'there was \"a very wide field in which the provinces undoubtedly ,are invested with legislative author\u00adity over newspapers\", continued:\nBut the limit, in our opinion, is reached when the legislation effects such a curtailment of the exercise of the right of public discussion as substantially to interfere with the working of the parliamentary institu\u00adtions of Canada as contemplated by the provisions of The British North America Act and the statutes of the Dominion of Canada. Such a limitation is necessary, in our opinion., \"in order,\" to adapt the words quote above from the judgment in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe (1887) 12 A.C. 575, \"to afford scope\" for the working of such parliamentary institutions. In this region of constitutional practice, it is not permitted to a provincial legislature to do indirectly what cannot be done directly (Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King (1921) 2 A.C. 91, at 100).\nWhether the learned Chief Justice was of opinion that the legislation in question in that case was incompetent to parliament as well as to a provincial legislature, it is not necessary to consider. It was clearly, in the opinion of the learned Chief Justice, beyond provincial competence.\nI respectfully agree with this view, in the light of which it is plain that by-law 184 cannot be supported as within any of the heads of legislative jurisdiction conferred upon the provinces by section 92. If provincial legislation could validly authorize ;a by-law such as that here in question, it could legislate so as to prevent the distribution within the whole or any part of the province, of pamphlets or newspapers published elsewhere within or without the province. This is clearly contrary to the law as envisaged by Duff, C.J.\nIn the same case, Cannon J. said at p. 144:\nThe bill does not regulate the relations of the newspapers' owners with private individual members of the public, but deals exclusively with expressions of opinion by the newspapers concerning government policies and activities. The pith and substance of the bill is to regulate the press of Alberta from the viewpoint of public policy by preventing the public from being misled or deceived as to any policy or activity of the Social Credit Government and by reducing any opposition to silence or bring upon it ridicule and public contempt. I agree with the submission of the Attorney-General for Canada that this bill deals with the regulation of the press of Alberta, not from the viewpoint of private wrongs or civil injuries resulting from any alleged infringement or privation of civil rights which belong to individuals, considered as individuals, but from the viewpoint of public wrongs or crimes, i.e., involving a violation of the public rights and duties to the whole community, considered as a community, in its social aggregate capacity.\nThe learned judge referred to the sections of the Criminal Code dealing with seditious words and publications and pointed out that while at first in England criticism of any government policy was regarded as a crime, since the passing of Fox's Libel Act in 1792 it is not criminal, as the Canadian Criminal Code now provides, to point out errors in the government of the country and to urge their removal by lawful means. The learned judge then continued:\nNow, it seems to me that the Alberta legislature by this retrograde Bill is attempting to revive the old theory of the crime of seditious libel by enacting penalties, confiscation of space in newspapers and prohibitions for actions which, after due consideration by the Dominion Parliament, have been declared innocuous and which, therefore, every citizen of Canada can do lawfully and without hindrance or fear of punishment. It is an attempt by the legislature to amend the Criminal Code in this respect and to deny the advantage of sec. 133(a) to the Alberta newspaper publishers.\nUnder the British system, which is ours, no political party can erect a prohibitory barrier to prevent the electors from getting information concerning the policy of the government. Freedom of discussion is essential to enlighten public opinion in a democratic State; it cannot be curtailed without affecting the right of the people to be informed through sources independent of the government concerning matters of public interest. There must be an untrammelled publication of the news and political opinions of the political parties contending for ascendancy. As stated in the preamble of The British North America Act, our constitution is and will remain, unless radically changed, \"similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom.\" At the time of Confederation, the United Kingdom was a democracy. Democracy cannot be maintained without its foundation: free public opinion and free discussion throughout the nation of all matters affecting the State within the limits set by the criminal code and the common law. Every inhabitant in Alberta is also a citizen of the Dominion. The province may deal with his property and civil rights of a local and private nature within the province; but the province cannot interfere with his status as a Canadian citizen and his fundamental right to express freely his untrammelled opinion about government policies and discuss matters of public concern. The mandatory and prohibitory provisions of the Press Bill are, in my opinion, ultra vires of the provincial legislature. They interfere with the free working of the political organization of the Dominion. They have a tendency to nullify the political rights of the inhabitants of Alberta, as citizens of Canada, and cannot be considered as dealing with matters purely private and local in that province. The federal parliament is the sole authority to curtail, if deemed expedient and in the public interest, the freedom of the press in discussing public affairs and the equal rights in that respect of all citizens throughout the Dominion. These subjects were matters of criminal law before Confederation, have been recognized by Parliament as criminal matters and have been expressly dealt with by the criminal code. No province has the power o reduce in that province the political rights of its citizens as compared with those enjoyed by the citizens of other provinces of Canada. Moreover, citizens outside the province of Alberta have a vital interest in having full information and comment, favourable and unfavourable, regarding the policy of the Alberta government and concerning events in that province which would, in the ordinary course, be the subject of Alberta newspapers' news items and articles.\nWith the same reservation already made with respect to the judgment of Duff C.J., in the same case, I agree that such a subject-matter of legislation is at any rate beyond the jurisdiction conferred by any, of the heads of s. 92 and, accordingly, the provisions of the by-law here in question cannot stand. With respect to the charter, I would construe its provisions as not intended to authorize such a by-law; Reference re Minimum Wage Act[42].\nI would therefore allow the appeal. The appellant is entitled to a declaration that the said by-law is ultra vires the respondent and the respondent, its officers and agents are restrained from in any way attempting to enforce its provisions. I agree with the order as to costs proposed by my brother Kerwin.\nESTEY, J.:\u2014The City of Quebec, on October 23, 1933, enacted By-law 184, the material portion of which reads as follows:\nIt is, by the present by-law forbidden to distribute in the streets of the City of Quebec, any book, pamphlet, booklet, circular, tract whatever without having previously obtained for so doing the written permission of the Chief of Police.\nThe .appellant submits that the by-law is legislation that interferes with \"the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship,\" authority for the enactment of which the Province could not give to the City of Quebec as under the B.N.A. Act only the Parliament of Canada can competently enact such legislation.\nCounsel for the City and the Province of Quebec submit that the by-law is but legislation on the part of the City in relation to its power over the public streets and in partic\u00adular was enacted to avoid a nuisance and to protect the health of the citizens and the cleanliness of the City. That a by-law passed for such purposes would be com\u00adpetently authorized by ss. 335, 336 and 337 of the charter granted by the Province to the City of Quebec (19 Geo. V. S. of Q., Ch. 95) is not contested. It is, therefore, unnecessary to set forth these provisions further than to point out that it is expressly stated in s. 337 that the by-laws of the City of Quebec shall not be \"inconsistent with the law of Canada or of this Province ...\"\nIn this regard it is important to observe that s. 2 of Ch. 307, R.S.Q. 1941, reads:\n2. The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, provided the same be not made an excuse for acts of licentiousness, or a justification of practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the Province, are by the constitution and laws of this Province allowed to all His Majesty's subjects living within the same.\nThis s. 2 has been in the statute law of the Province of Quebec since at least 1888 (R.S.Q. 1888, Art. 3439). With some minor changes in expression this provision is found in a statute enacted in 1851 (S. of C. 14-15 Vict., Ch. 175) at a time when the problems arising out of clergy reserves were engaging the minds of the Members of Parliament.\nUnder s. 42 of the Act of Union, 1840, it was provided, inter alia, that a bill in relation to or affecting the enjoyment or exercise of any form or mode of religious worship should not come into force until assented to by Her Maj\u00adesty. This was in force when the legislation of 1851 was enacted which, in accordance therewith, was transmitted to London and Her Majesty assented thereto on May 15, 1852.\nIt is also significant, and its importance was stressed throughout the hearing of this appeal, that in the Treaty of Paris, 1763, the following is included:\n4. \u2026 His Britannick Majesty on his side, agrees to grant the liberty of the Catholick religion to the inhabitants of Canada: he will in consequence give the most precise and most effectual orders that his new Roman Catholick subjects may profess the worship of their religion according to the rites of the Romish Church, as far as the laws of Great Britain permit. \u2026\nWhile the treaty, in Art. 4, refers to Nova Scotia, or Acadia, and Canada as separate entities and is open to the construction that the foregoing applied only to Canada, this is clarified when the boundaries, of the British and French territories on the Continent of America are fixed in Art. 7, which concludes with the words:\nThe stipulations inserted in the IVth article, in favour of the inhabitants of Canada, shall also take place with regard to the inhabitants of the countries ceded by this article.\nIt, therefore, appears that the foregoing portion of Art. 4 was intended to apply to all of the British Dominions in North America.\nThis right granted by the Treaty of Paris has been preserved by The Quebec Act of 1774, The Constitutional Act of 1791, and The Act of Union of 1840. The existence of this right and the provisions of the Act of 1851 would be present to the minds of those who drafted and the Members of Parliament who enacted the B.N.A. Act. It must be assumed, therefore, that it was intended legislation in rela\u00adtion thereto would come within the provisions of the B.N.A. Act and be competently enacted either by the Parliament of Canada or the provincial legislature as therein provided. The circumstances under which the Treaty of Paris and the legislation of 1851 were prepared and adopted suggest the provisions of each of these here referred to were both intended to promote peace, order and good government in the country as a whole. This conclusion finds support from the fact that the foregoing quotation was placed in Art. 7 of the Treaty of Paris, which commences with the words \"In order to re-establish peace on solid and durable founda\u00adtions, \" It is also emphasized both by the preamble of the Act of 1851 rand in the operative part by the limita\u00adtion imposed upon the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship. In the preamble it is set out that\nthe recognition of legal equality among all Religious Denominations is an admitted principle of Colonial Legislation; And ... . in the state and condition of this Province ... . it is desirable that the same should receive the sanction of direct Legislative Authority, recognizing and declaring the same as a fundamental principle of our civil polity:\nand then in the operative part a limitation is imposed to the effect that its exercise and enjoyment should not be \"made an excuse for acts of licentiousness, or a justification of practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the Province.\" It will also be observed that in the declaration of this right in the Act of 1851 no penalty is provided for infraction thereof. That would indicate that such was left to the field of criminal law where, in principle, it would seem to belong. The right of the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, is a personal, sacred right for which, history records, men have striven and fought. Wherever attained they have resisted restrictions and limitations thereon in every possible manner. In one sense it may be styled a civil right, but it does not follow that it would be included within the phrase \"Property and Civil Rights in the Province\" within 'the meaning of s. 92(13) of the B.N.A. Act. On the contrary it would rather seem that such a right should be included among those upon which the Parliament of Canada might legislate for the preservation of peace, order and good government.\nMoreover, having regard to 'the nature and character of the right which was, by the Treaty of Paris, given \"to the inhabitants of the countries ceded\" and the legislation of 1851 where it, is in the preamble thereto stated \"legal equality among all Religious Denominations is an admitted principle of Colonial Legislation\" and such \"a fundamental principle of our civil polity\" that legislative sanction should be given thereto, it would appear that if the draftsmen and those enacting the B.N.A. Act had intended 'that legislation in relation to this right should be enacted by the province and effective in a part, rather than by the Parliament of Canada and, therefore, effective in the country as a whole, that express language to that effect would have been embodied in that enactment, more particularly as by that Act \"one Dominion under the Crown with a constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom\" was created.\nFurthermore, if such had not been the intention of those preparing and enacting the B.N.A. Act it would seem most unlikely that under s. 93 thereof they would have given, in relation to education, the exclusive legislative authority to the provincial legislature and then have specifically reserved an appeal \"to the Governor General in Council from any Act or Decision of any Provincial Authority affecting any Right or Privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic minority .of the Queen's subjects in relation to education\" and given power to the Parliament of Canada to enact legislation, in the absence of appropriate provincial legisla\u00adtion, requisite for the due \"Execution of the Provisions\" of s. 93 and necessary to give effect to its decision upon any appeal under that section.\nIt, therefore, appears that legislation in relation to this right comes within the description and classification referred to by Sir Montague E Smith in Russell v. The Queen[43], where his Lordship, when considering the competence of the Parliament of Canada to enact The Canada Temperance Act, 1878, stated:\nLaws of this nature designed for the promotion of public order, safety, or morals, and which subject those who contravene them to criminal procedure and punishment, belong to the subject of public wrongs rather than to that of civil rights. They are of a nature which fall within the general authority of Parliament to make laws for the order and good government of Canada, and have direct relation to criminal law, which is ope of the enumerated classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the Parliament of Canada. It was said in the course .of the judgment of this Board in the case of the Citizens Insurance Company of Canada v. Parsons (7 App. Cas. 96) that the two sections (91 and 92) must be read together, and the language of one interpreted, and, where necessary, modified by that of the other. Few, if any, laws could be made by Parliament for the peace, order, and good government of Canada which did not in some incidental way affect property and civil rights; and it could not have been intended, when assuring to the provinces exclusive legislative authority on the subjects of property and civil rights, to exclude the Parliament from the exercise of this general power whenever any such incidental interference would result from it. The true nature and character of the legislation in the particular instance under discussion must always be determined, in order to ascertain the class of subject to which it really belongs. In the present case it appears to their Lordships, for the reasons already given, that the matter of the Act in question does not properly belong to the class of subjects \"Property and Civil Rights\" within the meaning of sub-sect. 13.\nThe provision of the enactment of 1851 (assented to in 1852), being legislation under s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, by virtue of s. 129 thereof continued in force after Confedera\u00adtion and thereafter could be repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament of Canada but not by a provincial legis\u00adlature. It has never been repealed or altered by that Parliament and, therefore, remains in force. The enactment, therefore, of s. 2 of ch. 307 by the Province of Quebec, being legislation in relation to this right, could not be enacted under either heading (13) (Property and Civil Rights in the Province) or (16) (Generally all Matters of a merely Local or Private Nature in the Province) of s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act.\nThe Act of 1851 being still in force, it is necessary to examine the by-law to determine whether, in its true nature and character, it is legislation in relation to the free exer\u00adcise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship or to the exercise of power over the public streets.\nThe by-law contains neither preamble nor language that expressly sets forth with what intent and purpose it was passed. It is contended, as already stated, that it was passed to prevent the existence of a nuisance, to protect the health of the people and the cleanliness of the city. Distribution of pamphlets and other printed matter has taken place since time immemorial and it is significant that no instance was mentioned where the distribution of such ever constituted a nuisance or an interference with the health of the people or the cleanliness of the city. If, as it may be conceded, the distribution of pamphlets or other printed matter might be done in a manner to create a nuisance, impair the health and make the city unclean, such an unusual 'circumstance could be dealt with apart from any such by-law as here in question. Moreover, it is pertinent to observe that the by-law contains no direction to the Chief of Police that might guide or assist him in determining whether in a given instance the distribution might constitute a nuisance, undermine the health of the people or impair the cleanliness of the city. This would appear a significant omission, more particularly as the by-law was passed in 1933 at a time when Jehovah's Witnesses were being brought before the courts of the Province for various offences, and in the course of the hearing of this appeal it was stated and not contradicted that distribution under this by-law has been refused only to Jehovah's Wit\u00adnesses. The fact that the appellant had made no applica\u00adtion does not, therefore, affect the issues in this appeal. In these 'circumstances Mr. Justice Bertrand appears to accur\u00adately state the real intent and purpose or pith and substance of this by-law:\nLa tentative de la dite Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec de pr\u00e9senter son r\u00e8glement comme une simple mesure de protection contre l'encombrement des rues et places publiques ne nous oblige pas d'\u00eatre na\u00effs au point de croire \u00e0 leurs protestations de bonne foi, car en \u00e9tudiant mes notes, j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de prendre connaissance des diff\u00e9rentes causes qui nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises, ainsi qu'\u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada. Sur le sujet, j'y ai constat\u00e9 que les personnes en autorit\u00e9 dans plusieurs villes de cette province ont trait\u00e9 les t\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah comme des criminels. Les notes du savant Juge Rand, dans la cause de Boucher, entre autres, m'ont convaincu d'une v\u00e9ritable pers\u00e9cution religieuse.\nIt is, however, contended that the 'by-law does not inter\u00adfere with any act of worship on the part of Jehovah's Wit\u00adnesses. It is conceded that the appellant and other citizens may believe what appears to them to be consistent with their conception of truth and that they have the right \"to worship God in their own way.\" In this connection it is important to observe that the statute of 1851 protects \"the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship.\" This provision contemplates that subject to the proviso contained therein individuals may select their own form of religious profession and worship. It is hardly neces\u00adsary to observe that the foregoing does not in any way prevent a provincial legislature enacting legislation within its own jurisdiction that may affect the right 'of religious profession and worship.\nMoreover, the language of the foregoing provision ought not to receive a narrow or restricted construction. History plainly indicates that in England the Roman Catholics and other religious bodies and in France the Protestants were denied that which is declared in the foregoing section. Indeed, it was 'a religious controversy in this country, mainly in respect of clergy reserves and matters incident thereto, that led to the enactment of this provision in 1851.\nIn clear and unambiguous language the Legislature of 'that day ensured freedom of religious profession and worship and the Parliament of Canada has not seen fit to repeal, alter or amend this statutory provision. In these circumstances it is the duty of the courts to give effect thereto and, in particular, in the adjudication of particular cases, to see that it is not used to defeat the very end the statute was intended to maintain.\nIt may be pointed out that even if s. 2 of ch. 307, R.S.Q. 1941, was intra vires, this By-law 184 would be in conflict therewith and, therefore, could not be competently passed by the City of Quebec because it was not authorized by the terms \"of its charter. The parties hereto expressly asked that the decision be reached quite apart from any issue that might be raised with respect to delegation of authority within the terms of By-law 184.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed and a judgment directed declaring the by-law invalid and an injunction restraining the City from acting thereunder. I agree with my brother Kerwin as to the disposition of costs.\nLOCKE J. :\u2014The preamble to chapter 175 of the Statutes of the Province of Canada for the year 1851 reads as follows:\u2011\nWhereas the recognition of legal equality amongst all Religious Denominations is an admitted principle of Colonial Legislation: And whereas in the state and condition of this Province, to which such a principle is peculiarly applicable, it is desirable that the same should receive the sanction of direct Legislative Authority recognizing and declaring the same as a fundamental principle of our civil polity: Be it therefore declared and enacted by the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent 'of the Legislative Council and of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada constituted and assembled by virtue of and under the authority of an Act passed in the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and intituled, An Act to re-unite the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, and for the Government of Canada, and it is hereby declared and enacted by the authority of the same, That the free exercise and enjoyment of Religious Profession and Worship, without discrimination or preference, so as the same be not made an excuse for acts of licentiousness, or a justification of practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the Province, is by constitution and laws of this Province allowed to all Her Majesty's subjects within the same.\nThe statute was reserved for the signification of Her Majesty's pleasure and the Royal assent given by Her Majesty in Council on May 15th, 1852.\nThis statute was in force when the British North America Act of 1867 was passed by the Imperial Parliament. It could not, in my opinion, be repealed by the Province of Quebec or by the Legislature of any other province of Canada (Dobie v. Temporalities Board[44]). Whether it would be intra vires Parliament to repeal the Act, in view of the language of the preamble to the British North America Act, is a matter to be decided when that question arises. It does not arise in the present case. Parliament has passed no legislation purporting to repeal the Act. In the Revised Statutes of Quebec of 1888 there appeared as Article 3439 the following:\u2014\nThe free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship without discrimination or preference so as the same be not made an excuse for acts of licentiousness or a justification of practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the Province are by the constitution and laws of this Province allowed to all Her Majesty's subjects within the same.\nThis provision is continued as section 2 of chapter 307 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec 1941. If this section was an attempt to confer substantive rights and not merely a recital of the rights declared by the Statute of 1852, the section dealt with matters which were beyond the powers of the Province unless, as is contended by the respondent in the present matter, under Head 13 of section 92 of the British North America Act the Province was empowered to legislate as to the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship within the Province.\nThe articles of the City charter under which the by-law attacked in the present proceedings was passed are 335 and 337 and read:\u2014\n335. The council may, at any of its meetings at which the absolute majority of its members are present, pass by-laws for the following purposes: For the good order, peace, security, comfort, improvement, cleanliness, internal economy and local government of the said city; for the prevention and suppression of all nuisances, and ,of all acts, matters and things in. the said city, opposed, contrary or prejudicial to the order, peace, comfort, morals, health, improvement, cleanliness, internal economy or local government of the said city.\nAnd for the greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the scope of the foregoing provision or of any power 'otherwise conferred by this charter, it is hereby declared that the authority and jurisdiction of the city council extends and shall hereafter extend to all matters hereinafter mentioned, that is to say:\n1. The raising of money by taxation;\n2. The borrowing of money on the city credit;\n3. Streets, lanes, and highways, and the right of passage above, across, along, or beneath the same;\n4. Sewers, drains and waterworks;\n5. Parks, squares and ferries;\n6. Licenses for trading and peddling;\n7. The public peace and safety;\n8. Health and sanitation;\n9. Vaccination and inoculation;\n10. Public works and improvements;\n11. Explosive substances;\n12. Nuisances; 13. Markets and abattoirs;\n14. Decency and good morals;\n15. Masters and servants;\n16. Water, light, heat, electricity and railways;\n17. The granting of franchises and privileges to persons or companies;\n18. The inspection of food.\n337. In order to give full effect to articles 335 (and 336, and to extend and complete the same, so as to secure full autonomy for the city and to avoid any interpretation of such articles or their paragraphs which might be considered as a restriction, of its powers, the city is authorized to adopt, repeal or amend and carry out all necessary by-laws concerning the proper administration of its affairs, peace, order and safety, as well as all matters which may concern or affect public interest and the welfare of the citizens; provided always that such by-laws be not inconsistent with the laws of Canada or of this Province, nor contrary to any special provision of this charter.\nThe by-law attacked was enacted in the year 1933 by the Council of the City and reads:\u2014\nIT IS ORDAINED and ENACTED by the by-law of the Municipal Council of the City of Quebec and the said Council ORDAINS and ENACTS as follows, to wit:\u2014\n1. It is by the present by-law forbidden to distribute in the streets of the City of Quebec any book, pamphlet, booklet, circular, tract whatever without having previously obtained for so doing the written permission of the Chief of Police.\n2. Any one contravening the present by-law shall be liable to a fine, with or without costs, and in default of immediate payment of said fine, with or without costs, as the case may be, to an imprisonment, the amount of the said fine and the term of imprisonment to be fixed by the Recorder's Court of the City of Quebec, at its discretion, but the said fine shall not exceed one hundred dollars and the imprisonment shall not 'exceed three months ,of the calendar, said imprisonment nevertheless shall cease at any time before the expiration of the term fixed by the said Recorder's Court, upon payment of the said fine or of the said fine and costs, as the case may be, and if said infraction is repeated, said repetition of offence shall constitute day by day, after summons or arrest, a separate offence.\nWhile, on the face of it, the by-law may be said to be directed to the controlling of the condition of the streets of the City by preventing the accumulation of litter from cir\u00adculars or pamphlets distributed in the streets being thrown away, or of traffic on the streets which might be impeded by the presence of persons distributing such writings, the course of the trial, the factums filed on behalf of the respondent and intervenant and the argument addressed to us make it quite clear that the purpose of the by-law and its real nature are something entirely different. The trial was held before Casgrain, J. Part of the evi\u00addence tendered on behalf of the present appellant was that of Mr. H.C. Covington, a minister of the religious organ\u00adization known as Jehovah's Witnesses and Vice-President of the legal governing body of that organization. In describ\u00ading the nature of the religious belief of Jehovah's Witnesses and of their activities, he said in part:\u2014\nJehovah's witnesses are an unincorporated body of missionary evangelists, their primary purpose being to preach the gospel of God's Kingdom throughout the whole world, as a witness, in execution of the commission recorded in Matthew 24:14, and this body is a missionary society preaching throughout the whole world, in every country, under the sun, save and except Russia.\nJehovah's witnesses preach the gospel as missionary evangelists world-wide, including Quebec, by calling from door to door, doing missionary work, visiting the people and explaining to them about, God's Kingdom as the only hope of mankind. That's the primary introduction to the people, and if they find people who are disinterested, they pass on to the next house. If they find persons interested, they stay and talk with them about the Bible and concerning God's Kingdom. And if the interested people desire to have them call back or re-visit, they do so. That is what we call revisiting for back-calls, revisiting for the purpose of answering questions and explaining Bible prophecy concerning God's Kingdom. And in addition to that method of preaching, Jehovah's witnesses hold Bible studies in the homes of the people where groups of from 2 to 15 or more people attend regularly each week. In these studies, the mission\u00adary evangelist presides as minister, and then he explains where these texts are to be found in the Bible. And that work is carried on throughout the whole world, including Canada and Quebec. Jehovah's witnesses, in preaching missionary evangelical work, employ primarily the facilities of the press. Printed literature is prepared by Jehovah's witnesses and left with the people for the purpose of leaving with them printed sermons concerning God's Kingdom as the only hope for mankind, and every one of Jehovah's witnesses employs this facility of the press in addition to the word as a method of preaching and teaching. In addition, Jehovah's witnesses also preach from the pulpit, from the platform, to public gatherings, just like the orthodox clergy.\nJehovah's witnesses differ primarily between themselves and the orthodox clergy in that Jehovah's witnesses go to the people with their message and talk to them in their homes, instead of forcing the people to come to them to some meeting. Jehovah's witnesses do employ public meetings, but in addition to that, the great part of their missionary work is done by Jehovah's witnesses going to the home, and that is exactly the way Jesus Christ and the apostles did it. Jesus Christ and the apostles, according to the Bible, went from house to house and door to door, for instance, St. Paul and St. Luke, and in Matthew 28:20, and 1 Peter, 2nd Chapter, 21st verse, Peter says that all those followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, who was the first minister, should follow in his footsteps, in Christ's steps. The new text uses the word \"house\" in the gospel more than 120 times. And Jehovah's witnesses therefore employ this primitive method of preaching and teaching. It is not only a biblical way, but we have found from practice that that is the only way of getting this message to the people effectively. Mr. Covington said further that they considered the dis\u00adtribution of literature in which they sought to convey their belief to others was a necessary and vital part of their activities and way of worship. The Bible he referred to as their text book and declared their belief in God and in his Son Jesus Christ as the Saviour and Redeemer of mankind. Speaking of other religious organizations, he said:\u2011\nWe do not judge other people, we emphatically take the view that other religious organizations that have departed from the Christian principles are teaching errors that lead mankind into the battle of destruction at Armageddon, and for that reason we hold the truth of the Bible so that any honest person, whether Catholic, Protestant or Jew, or non-Catholic or non-Jew, will see the truth and get on the highway that leads to life and avoid destruction at Armageddon. We do not pass judgment on any man, we merely act as witnesses to people, preaching what is to be found in the Bible.\nBy way of defence, the respondent called a number of witnesses, including a Roman Catholic priest, a Rabbi, a Clergyman of the Church of England ,and a Professor of Philosophy, to give evidence on such diverse subjects as to what were the elements of a religion, as to whether preach\u00ading alone was a religious act, whether the belief of the Jehovah's witnesses, as disclosed in a number of periodicals and pamphlets which it was shown were circulated by them, Was in fact a, religion, whether the activities of the witnesses were in fact religious activities, what was \"the meaning in philosophy\" of religious freedom \"as regards modern civilization\", whether the distribution of religious tracts in the homes of the people was a violation of relig\u00adious liberty and as to whether they thought it permissible to disobey the law if to obey it was contrary to their religious beliefs.\nThe claim of the appellant included the claim that he was being restrained in his right to the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship guaranteed to him by the Freedom of Worship Act of the Province. The respondent City had pleaded by paragraph 17 of its Defence that:\u2014\nLe demandeur n'est pas un ministre du culte et l'organisation dont il fait partie n'est pas une \u00e9glise ni une religion; au contraire, les actions ill\u00e9gales du demandeur, en accord avec celles d'autres membres du groupement appel\u00e9 \"T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah\", lorsqu'ils distribuent des pamphlets ou tracts d'un caract\u00e8re provocateur ,et injurieux, ne sont pas des gestes religieux mais des actes anti-sociaux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 et sont de nature \u00e0 troubler la paix publique et la tranquilit\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des paisibles citoyens particuli\u00e8rement dans la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, et risquent d'y provoquer des d\u00e9sordres. These witnesses were apparently called as experts. The question for the learned trial Judge to decide on this issue was whether the belief of Jehovah's Witnesses and their mode of worship fell within the meaning of the expression \"religious profession and worship\" in the preamble of the Statute of 1852. Covington had stated the nature .of that belief and his evidence was not contradicted and its truth cannot be questioned. Counsel for the appellant objected to the admission of the evidence of these witnesses, but his objections were overruled. The matter was not one upon which expert evidence was admissible and none of this evidence should have been received.\nI see no difficulty in interpreting the simple and clear language of the preamble of the Statute of 1852 nor of section 2, of the Provincial Statute of 1941 if, contrary to my opinion, the latter statute touches the matter. To claim that those who believe in God and in his Son Jesus Christ .do not hold a religious belief and that to profess that belief and attempt to communicate it to others, in the manner which the Jehovah's Witnesses believe they are commanded to do by the Bible, is not exercising a religious profession and an act of worship is, in my opinion, untenable.\nIn the factum filed on behalf of the respondent, lengthy extracts are given from various publications of Jehovah's Witnesses, some .of which appear to me to be expressed in intemperate language and are no doubt obnoxious to others who entertain other Christian beliefs as well as to people of the Jewish faith. The purpose of bringing these lengthy quotations to our attention is apparently in an endeavour to establish that the faith of Jehovah's Witnesses and their mode of worship are not entitled to the protection of the Statute of 1852 and the Quebec statute, and also to support the view that the effect of distributing this literature in a province where the people are predominantly of the Roman Catholic faith will be to provoke disorders.\nThe learned counsel for the respondent, at the com\u00admencement of his argument, said with commendable frank\u00adness that the by-law was directed against the contents of the documents. This was made abundantly clear by the proceedings at the trial and is, in my opinion, quite beyond dispute. If anything further were needed to demonstrate that the purpose of the by-law is to impose a censorship, it is to be found in the evidence given on behalf of the respondent. Among the witnesses called by the City was a Mr. Ohman, described as an Evangelist of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, who had obtained a permit which allowed him to sell the religious literature .of his faith from house to house. According to this witness, he had received a good reception when he applied for his permit. Saumur did not apply for a permit, being advised apparently that as the by-law was ultra vires it was wholly ineffective, but the whole attitude adopted on behalf, of the City makes it plain that had he done so the permit would have been refused. Apparently, the Chief of Police of the City of Quebec, did not object to the teachings of the Seventh Day Adventists while disapproving that of Jehovah's Witnesses.\nOn behalf of the intervenant it has been contended before us that, assuming the belief of the Jehovah's Witnesses is one entitled otherwise to the protection of the Statute of 1852 or the Provincial Statute, he may be deprived of that right by or under the authority of a statute of the Provincial Legislature. The argument is based on the contention that the rights so given to the people .of Canada to complete freedom in these matters is a civil right of which they may be deprived by appropriate legislation by the Province. It is further contended, though rather faintly, that the legislation may be justified under Head 16 as being 'a matter of a merely local or private nature in the province.\nIn the factum of the intervenant the matter is thus expressed:\u2014\nUnder our constitution there is no religious freedom except within the limits determined by the competent legislative authority. No such authority is known other than the provincial authority; religious teaching as a matter of fact is part of the realm of education reserved to the provinces; besides, religious freedom is one of the civil rights also reserved to the provinces.\nThe reference to rights reserved to the provinces in respect of religious teaching refers, of course, to the provisions of section 93 of the British North America Act. If the argument is sound, then the holding of religious services by 'the adherents of any faith designated by the Legislature may be prohibited. This argument put forward, so far as I am aware, for the first time in any reported case in Canada since Confedera\u00adtion raises questions which are of profound importance to all of 'the people of this country. Not only the right of freedom of worship would be affected but the exercise of other fundamental rights, such as that of free speech on matters of public interest and to publicly disseminate news, subject only to the restraints imposed by 'the Criminal Code and to such civil liability as may attach to the publication of libelous matters, might be restrained or prohibited. The language of the by-law is perfectly general and if this contention of the intervenants be right the Chief of Police might forbid the 'distribution in the streets of circulars or pamphlets published by one political party while allowing such distribution by that party which he personally favoured. It is well, in my opinion, 'that it be made clear that this right is involved in the decision of this case. Once a right of censorship of the contents of religious pub\u00adlications is established, the dissemination of the political views of writers by circulars or pamphlets delivered on the streets may equally be prohibited or restrained.\nThe idea of imposing censorship upon the distribution of political and religious publications is not of course new. After the Restoration in England, the Licensing Act of 1662 prohibited any private person to publish any book or pamphlet unless it were first licensed: law books by the Lord Chancellor, historical or political books by the Secre\u00adtary of State and all other books by the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Bishop of London or by the Chancellor or Vice-Chancellor of one of the universities. Authors and writers 'of works considered 'obnoxious were liable to capital punishment or to be flogged or fined or imprisoned, accord\u00ading to the nature of the offence (Taswell-Langmead Constitutional History, 10th Ed. p. 739). At the Accession of James II in 1685, the Licensing Act was revived for several years and was thus in force at the Revolution and was once more revived in 1692 for one year, but a further attempt to revive it in 1695 was negatived by the Commons and thenceforth the censorship of the press ceased to be part of the law of England. The history of the restriction of religious liberty in England and upon the freedom of the press is traced in Taswell-Langmead's work, commencing at p. 728. At p. 744 of this work the learned author, after referring to the changes brought about by the Reform Act of 1832, said 'that from that year the freedom of the press has been 'completely established and the utmost latitude of criticism and invective has been allowed it in discussing the actions of the Government and of all public men and measures.\nThe purpose of this by-law is to establish a censorship upon the distribution of written publications in the City of Quebec. It is not the distribution of all pamphlets, circu\u00adlars or other publications in the streets which is prohibited but of those in respect of which the written permission of the Chief of Police has not been obtained.\nIn the preamble to the British North America Act the opening paragraph says:\u2014\nWhereas the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have expressed their desire to be federally united into one Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with a constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom.\nand, after reciting that such a union would conduce to the welfare of the provinces, it is said that it is expedient not only that the constitution of the legislative authority in the Dominion be provided for but also that the nature of the Executive Government therein be declared. At the time this Act was passed, the Act of 1852 declaring the right to freedom of religious belief and worship was in force in Canada and gave to the inhabitants of the provinces the same rights in that respect as were then enjoyed by the people of the United Kingdom.\nIt has, I think, always been accepted throughout Canada that, while the exercise of this right might be restrained under the provisions of the saving clause of the statute of 1852 by criminal legislation passed by Parliament under Head 27 of section 91, it was otherwise a constitutional right of all the inhabitants of this country. An examination of the reports 'of the arguments advanced by the parties to the litigation which ensued following the passing of the Manitoba School Act of .1890 (Barrett v. City of Winnipeg[45] and Brophy v. Attorney General of Manitoba[46]), makes it clear that it was common ground .as between the litigants that the Province might not in any manner limit or restrict the right of the Roman Catholic minority to the free exercise and enjoyment of Religious Profession and Worship. Dubuc, J., later Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench for Manitoba, who dissented from the judg\u00adment of the majority on the appeal from Killam, J. is the only one of the Judges who considered Barrett's case who made any reference to the matter. At p. 360 of 7 M.R., he said:\u2014\nThe State may hold that ignorance is an evil to be remedied by public instruction and may see that certain secular subjects, which are known to form the basis of a proper education, be taught in schools assisted by public money. But in a community composed, of different elements, the State should not ignore the particular conditions, wants and just claims of an important class of citizens, especially when such important class are, in every respect, loyal and law-abiding subjects, and there is nothing in their wants and claims clashing with the rights of other classes, or contrary to, or conflicting with, the letter, the spirit or the true principles of the Constitution. The liberty of conscience is one of the fundamental principles of our Constitution. What the Roman Catholics ask in claiming the right to maintain their denominational schools is only the carrying out, to the full extent, of that fundamental principle. The desirability of having religious instruction combined with secular teaching in schools is, as stated by my brother Killam, considered as of the utmost importance by very many Protestants as well as by Roman Catholics.\nThe constitutional right to which Dubuc, J. referred was either that given by the Statute of 1852, or that which, in my opinion, is implicit in the language of 'the preamble of the British North America Act.\nWhether the right to religious freedom and the right to free public discussion of matters' of public interest and the right to disseminate news, subject to the restrictions to which I have above referred to, differ in their nature, it is unnecessary to decide. The former of these rights is, however, certainly not the lesser of them in Canada. Unless they differ, had the powers of censorship vested by the by-law in the Chief of Police of the City of Quebec been exercised by preventing the distribution of the written views of a political party (and they may be so used) rather than the religious views of Saumur, the opinion of Sir Lyman Duff, C.J. in the Reference as to The Accurate News and Information Act of the Province of Alberta[47], would be directly to the contrary of the argument advanced on behalf of the intervenant.\nIt is true that in that case The Accurate News and Information Act was considered by all of the members of the Court who considered the various matters referred to them, as a bill which was a part of the general scheme of social credit legislation, the basis of which was the Alberta Social Credit Act and presupposed as a condition of its operation that the latter Act was validly enacted and that since it was ultra vires the ancillary and dependent legislation must fall with it. Nonetheless, Sir Lyman Duff expressed his considered view as to the right of a province to restrain public discussion upon affairs of public interest and Davis, J. agreed with him. The Act in question set up what was in effect a censorship of the newspapers of the province and would have imposed upon them the obligation of publishing a statement to be prepared by an official appointed by the Government \"as to the true and exact objects of the policy of the Government.\" The learned Chief Justice, after referring to the manner whereby under the constitution established by the British North America Act legislative power for Canada is vested in one Parliament consisting of the Sovereign, the Senate and the House of Commons, said in part (p. 133) :\u2014\nIt can be said that these provisions manifestly contemplate a House of Commons which is to be, as the name itself implies, a representative body; constituted, that is to say, by members elected by such of the population of the united provinces as may be qualified to vote. The preamble of the statute, moreover, shows plainly enough that the constitution of the Dominion is to be similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom. The statute contemplates a parliament working under the influence of public opinion and public discussion. There can be no controversy that such institutions derive their efficacy from the free public discussion of affairs, from criticism and answer and counter-criticism, from attack upon policy and administration and defence and counterattack; from the freest and fullest analysis and examination from every point of view of political proposals...\nThe right of public discussion is, of course, subject to legal restric\u00adtions; those based upon considerations of decency and public order, and others conceived for the protection of various private and public interests with which, for example, the laws of defamation and sedition are conearned. In a word, freedom of discussion means, to quote the words of Lord Wright in Tames v. Commonwealth, 1936 A.C. 578 at 627, 'freedom governed by law.' We do not doubt that (in addition to the power of disallowance vested in the Governor General) the Parliament of Canada possesses authority to legislate for the protection of this right. That authority rests upon the principle that the powers requisite for the protection of the constitution itself arise by necessary implication from The British North America Act as a whole (Fort Frances Pulp & Power Co. Ltd. v. Manitoba Free Press Co. Ltd. 1923, A.C. 695), and since the subject-matter in relation to which the power is exercised is not exclusively a provincial matter, it is necessarily vested in Parliament.\nBut this by no means exhausts the matter. Any attempt to abrogate this right of public debate or to suppress the traditional forms of the exercise of the right (in public meeting and through the press) would, in our opinion, be incompetent to the legislatures of the provinces, or to the legislature of any one of the provinces, as repugnant to the provisions of The British North America Act, by which the Parliament of Canada is established as the legislative organ of the people of Canada under the Crown, and Dominion legislation enacted pursuant to the legislative authority given by those provisions. The subject matter of such legisla\u00adtion could not be described as a provincial matter purely; as in substance exclusively a matter of property and civil rights within the province, or a matter private or local within the province. It would not be, to quote the words of the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King, 1921, 2 A.C. 91, at 122, legislation directed solely to the purposes specified in section 92; and it would be invalid on the principles enunciated in that judgment and adopted in Caron v. The King, 1924, A. C. 999 at 1005-6.\nThe question, discussed in argument, of the validity of the legislation before us, considered as a wholly independent enactment having no rela\u00adtion to the Alberta Social Credit Act, presents no little difficulty. Some degree of regulation of newspapers everybody would concede to the provinces.\nIndeed, there is a very wide field in which the provinces undoubtedly are invested with legislative authority over newspapers; but the limit, in our opinion, is reached when the legislation effects such a curtailment of the exercise of the right of public discussion as substantially to interfere with the working of the parliamentary institutions of Canada as contem\u00adplated by the provisions of the British North America Act and the statutes of the Dominion of Canada. Such a limitation is necessary, in our opinion, 'in order,' to adapt the words quoted above from the judg\u00adment in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe, 1887, 12 A.C. 575, 'to afford scope' for the working of such parliamentary institutions. In this region of constitutional practice, it is not permitted to a provincial legislature to dc indirectly what cannot be done directly (Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King, 1921, 2 A. C. 91 at 100).\nAfter quoting section 129 .of the British North America Act which, inter alia, continued all laws in force in Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the Union, until repealed, abolished, or altered by the Parliament of Canada or the Legislature of the respective Province, according to the authority of the Parliament or of that Legislature under this Act, he continued:\u2014\nThe law by which the right of public discussion is protected existed at the time of the enactment of The British North America Act and, as far as Alberta is concerned, at the date on which the Alberta Act came into force, the 1st of September, 1905. In our opinion (on the broad principle of the cases mentioned which has been recognized as limiting the scope of general words defining the legislative authority of the Dominion) the Legislature of Alberta has not the capacity under section 129 to alter that law by legislation obnoxious to the principle stated.\nWith this opinion in its entirety I respectfully agree and I have heard no reasoned argument against any of its con\u00adclusions. It may be said, with at least equal and I think greater force, that the right to the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship without discrim\u00adination or preference, subject to the limitations expressed in the concluding words, of the first paragraph of the Statute of 1852, existed at the time of the enactment, of the British North America Act and was not a civil right of the nature referred to under Head 13 of section 92 of the British North America Act.\nCannon, J. considered the question of the validity of the bill independently of the fact that it was part of the general scheme of social credit legislation and must accordingly be held ultra vires, since the Alberta Social Credit Act was itself beyond the powers of the Legislature. He expressed the view that The Accurate News and Information Act was an attempt by the Legislature to amend the Criminal Code and deny the advantage of section 133(a) to the Alberta newspapers' publishers, and so ultra vires. He was further of the opinion that the powers of the Province to deal with the property and civil rights of its citizens did not enable it to interfere with their fundamental rights to express freely their untrammelled opinion about Government pol\u00adicies and discuss matters of public concern. Crocket, Kerwin and Hudson, JJ., considering that the bill must of necessity be held ultra vires, since the Alberta Social Credit Act was found to be beyond the powers of the Legislature, did not express any opinion on the matters which I have referred to above. If there has been expressed any judicial opinion on this subject, however, contrary to that expressed by Sir Lyman Duff and by Davis and Cannon, JJ., we have not been referred to it. The right of which Dubuc, J. spoke in Barrett's ease in the passage above referred to was a right of the subjects of Her Majesty under the constitution of the United Kingdom referred to in the preamble of the British North America Act when that statute was passed in 1867. The effect of the Statute of 1852 and that of 1867 was to con\u00adtinue that right in the people of Canada as a constitutional right and one which, in my opinion, did not fall within the category of civil rights under Head 13 of section 92. I have had the advantage of reading the opinion of my brother Kellock and I agree with his reasons and with his conclusion on this aspect of the matter.\nThe distinction between this and the by-law considered in In Re Cribbin and the City of Toronto[48], and in Toronto Corporation v. Roman Catholic Separate Schools Trustees49 is, in my opinion, quite clear. In Cribbin's case the City of Toronto had passed a by-law providing that no person should on the Sabbath Day in any public park, square, garden, etc. in the City publicly preach, lecture or declaim. One of the objections to the by-law was apparently that it violated what is referred to in the judg\u00adment of Galt, C.J. as the constitutional right of all persons to hold meetings and make speeches in public parks. The argument on behalf of Cribbin does not indicate that it was objected that the by-law infringed any religious right of the applicant and the matter was not considered 'on that basis. What completely distinguishes the case, however, is that it applied to all persons of every religious denomina\u00adtion or belief. Had it 'applied to those of one religious denomination only while not to others and had the point been argued and decided, the case would have some applica\u00adtion to the present matter.\nIn City of Toronto Corporation v. The Trustees of the Roman Catholic Separate Schools[49], a by-law passed by the City under section 399a of the Municipal Act pro\u00adhibited the erection 'of buildings in 'a certain district, except for use as private residences. The by-law was attacked by the trustees who desired to erect a separate school in the area. Dealing with an argument based upon section 93 of the British North America Act, Viscount Cave, L.C. said (p. 88) :\u2014\nIn their Lordships' opinion this provision has no application to the present case. It is a restriction upon the power of the Province to make laws in relation to education, but does not prevent the provisions of the Municipal Act with reference to building, and other matters relating to the health and convenience of the population, from applying to denomina\u00adtional schools as well as to other buildings.\nHad the by-law prohibited the erection of a Roman Catholic school in the area while permitting those of other religious denominations, the case would directly touch the present matter.\nThe appellant further contends that the by-law is ultra vires the City and to authorize it ultra vires the Province of Quebec, since it trenches upon the jurisdiction of Parlia\u00adment under Head 27 of section 91. The answer of the intervenant and of the City to this contention is that in pith and substance the by-law does not deal with crime but is directed to the prevention of crime. On the strength of decisions such as Hodge v. The Queen[50] and Bedard v. Dawson[51] they contend the by-law to be intra vires.\nAn examination of the history of the legislation dealing with offences against religion in Taswell-Langmead's Con\u00adstitutional History and Hallam's History of England shows that the statutes dealing with what were declared to be offences against religion were all penal in their nature. In the Criminal Code, under the heading \"Offences against Religion\", sections 198 to 201 deal with the offence of blasphemous' libel and acts interfering with the free exercise of religious worship by the people of Canada. Section 198 provides that whether 'any particular published matter is a blasphemous libel or not is a question of fact and does not define the offence. It does, however, declare that no one is guilty of a blasphemous libel for expressing in good faith and indecent language, or attempting to establish by arguments used in good faith and conveyed in decent language, any opinion whatever upon any religious subject.\nThe Criminal Code also deals with libels in terms that go far to express in statutory form the rights of the Canadian people to freedom of speech in regard to matters of public interest. After defining a defamatory libel by section 317, sections 322, 323 and 324 provide that it is not an offence to publish in good faith, for the information of the public, a fair report of the proceedings of the Senate and House of Commons, or any committee thereof, or of the public pro\u00adceedings before any court exercising judicial authority, or any fair comment upon any such proceedings: that no one commits an offence by publishing in good faith, in a news-paper, a fair report of the proceedings of any public meeting if such meeting is lawfully convened for a lawful purpose and is open to the public, and if such report is fair and accurate, and if the publication of the matter 'complained 'of is' for the public benefit and if the defendant does not refuse to insert in a conspicuous place in the newspaper in which the report appeared 'a reasonable letter or document of explanation or contradiction by or on behalf of the prose\u00adcutor: and that no one commits an offence by publishing any defamatory matter which he, on reasonable grounds, believes to be true, and which is relevant to any subject of public interest, the public discussion of which is for the public benefit.\nI am quite unable to accept the contention of the intervenant that the real purpose of this by-law is to prevent public disorders, or that it is other than to provide a means to prevent the dissemination of religious views which are not approved by the authorities. The publication 'of relig\u00adious writings which offend people entertaining different religious beliefs to those of the publisher is not 'confined to any particular religious denomination or to those which adhere to any particular religious belief. It is also a matter of common knowledge that political writings expressed in pamphlets, circulars and newspapers have many times in the past, and no doubt will many times in the future, cause anger and resentment on the part of those entertaining different political views. If it be accepted for the purpose of argument that the distribution of such literature might induce some persons to commit acts of violence, it is for Parliament to decide whether this should be declared an offence in the Criminal Code. Parliament has not seen fit to pass such legislation and the Province is without any jurisdiction to do so. The appellant in the present matter has exercised what, in my opinion, is his constitutional right to the practice of his religious profession and mode of worship, and if doing so provokes other people to commit crimes of violence he commits no offence (Beatty v. Gilbanks[52]).\nIn Hodge v. The Queen, the Judicial Committee held that the Liquor License Act of 1877 of Ontario, which prescribed regulations in the nature of police or municipal regulations of a merely local character for the good government of taverns, did not in respect of those sections inter\u00adfere with the general regulation of trade and commerce, but came within the jurisdiction of the Province to legislate in regard to municipal institutions in the Province under Head 8, the imposition of punishment for enforcing 'any law of the Province made in relation to any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in sec\u00adtion 92 under Head 15, and generally all matters of a merely local or private nature under Head 16. In Bedard v. Dawson, a Quebec statute which authorized the Judge to order the closing of a disorderly house was held intra vires, as it dealt with a matter of property and civil rights by providing for the suppression of a nuisance and not with criminal law by aiming at the punishment of a crime. I think these cases have no application to the present matter, where the true purpose of the by-law is not to regulate traffic in the streets but to impose a censorship on the written expression of religious views and their dissemina\u00adtion, a constitutional right of all of the people of Canada, and to create a new criminal offence.\nI would allow the appeal and direct that judgment be entered declaring the by-law invalid and enjoin the respon\u00addent city from acting upon it. I agree with the order as to costs proposed by my brother Kerwin.\nThe dissenting judgment of Cartwright and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side[53], affirming the judgment of Casgrain J. whereby the action of the appel\u00adlant, asking that by-law 184 of the City of Quebec, passed on the 27th October, 1933, be declared to be-both on its face and insofar as the plaintiff is concerned-ultra vires, unconstitutional, illegal, null and void and be quashed and that the Statutes of the Province of Quebec insofar as they purport to authorize the enactment of such by-law be similarly declared ultra vires, was dismissed.\nAt the outset it is to be observed that the question sub\u00admitted to us for decision has been narrowed in the follow\u00ading respect. Counsel for the appellant, at an early stage of the hearing before us, expressly abandoned the argument that the by-law in question is invalid because of unlawful delegation of discretion to the Chief of Police and stated that it was his position that if it is within the powers of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec to authorize the City of Quebec to pass the by-law it has done so. The question was thereupon raised from the bench whether the Court should permit counsel to take this position, since to do so might well bring about the result that the Court would be giving its opinion on a constitutional issue of importance which did not require decision in this particular proceeding. However, it was the view of the majority of the Court that counsel for the appellant was entitled to limit his attack on the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench to such grounds as he chose to put forward and this view was made clear to all counsel. Consequently counsel for the appellant did not discuss the questions whether there was an unauth\u00adorized delegation to the Chief of Police and whether the enabling statutes conferred the power upon the. City to enact the by-law and counsel for the respondent and for the intervenant were not called upon to deal with these aspects of the matter and said nothing about them. In answer to a question from the bench put to counsel for the appellant during his reply he stated explicitly that he invited the Court to deal with the matter as if the relevant legislation of the Province of Quebec had expressly conferred upon the City power to pass the by-law in the very words in which it has been passed.\nUnder these circumstances the question we are called upon to decide is simply whether it is within the powers of the Provincial Legislature to authorize the City to pass the by-law, which so far as relevant, reads as follow:\u2014\n1. It is, by the present by-law forbidden to distribute in the streets of the City of Quebec, any book, pamphlet, booklet, circular, tract whatever without having previously obtained for so doing the written permis\u00adsion of the Chief of Police. Section 2 of the by-law prescribes penalties for its breach.\nIt is first necessary to determine the proper construction of the by-law. In doing so we must give to the words used their plain meaning in everyday language and when this is done I think it clear that what is prohibited is the distribu\u00adtion, without the permission of the Chief of Police, of printed matter of the kind described in the by-law in the streets of the City. The distribution of such matter anywhere else, as for example in private houses is not affected by the by-law. There is evidence in the record to indicate that the officials charged with the enforcement of the by-law have not so construed it and have instituted proceedings against persons, as for an infraction of the by-law, on the ground that such persons had distributed written matter at private residences in the City. Such evidence does not seem to me to be relevant to the proper construction of the by-law. It is only if the words of the by-law are ambiguous that we may resort to extraneous aids in its interpretation and the words used appear to me to be clear and unambig\u00aduous. The fact, if be the fact, that the by-law has been misinterpreted, can affect neither its proper construction nor the question of its validity.\nIn my view, legislation authorizing the city to pass this by-law is prima facie, in relation to either or both of two subjects within the provincial power which may be con\u00adveniently described as (i) the use of highways, and (ii) police regulations and the suppression of conditions likely to cause disorder. I propose to deal with these in the order mentioned.\nThe judgments of this Court in O'Brien v. Allen[54] and in Provincial Secretary of Prince Edward Island v. Egan[55], establish that the use of highways in the province is a subject matter within the provincial power. The following passages may be referred to. In O'Brien v. Allen (supra) at page 342, Sedgewick J., delivering the unanimous judg\u00adment of the Court said:\u2014\n... It has never been doubted that the right of building highways, and of operating them, whether under the direct authority of the Government or by means of individuals, 'companies or municipalities, is wholly within the purview of the provincial legislatures, and it follows that whether they be free public highways or subject to a toll authorized by legislative enactment, they are none the less within the provincial power. In Provincial Secretary of Prince Edward Island v. Egan (supra) at page 417, the present Chief Justice of Canada, then Rinfret J., delivering the judgment of himself, Crocket and Kerwin, JJ. referred to the last quoted passage with approval and ,continued:\u2014\nThe aspect of that field is wholly provincial, from the point of view both, of the use of the highway and of the use of the vehicles. It has to do with the civil regulation of the use of highways and personal property, the protection of the persons and property of the citizens, the prevention of nuisances and the suppression of conditions calculated to make circula\u00adtion and traffic dangerous.\nIn a separate judgment, at page 403, Sir Lyman Duff C.J.C. expressed his concurrence with Rinfret J.\nAt page 417, Hudson J. said :\u2014\nThe Province undoubtedly has the right to regulate highway traffic and, for that purpose, to license persons to use highways. The right to license also involves a right to control and, when necessary, to revoke the licence.\nIt is said, however, that it is beyond the power of the Province to deny the ordinary use of the highways to any member of the public. Certain passages in the judgment of Rand J. in Winner v. S.M.T. (Eastern) Ltd.[56], partic\u00adularly at pages 918 to 920, would require careful considera\u00adtion if the by-law purported to deny to any persons or classes of persons the right to use the highways for the purpose of passing and repassing, but the by-law in no way interferes with this right. Its operation is limited to pro\u00adhibiting the distribution of printed matter in the streets, without a licence. In my opinion, the common law is cor\u00adrectly stated in Pratt and Mackenzie's Law of Highways (19th Edition) at pages 1 and 2:\u2014\nThe right lof the public in a highway is an easement of passage only\u2014a right, of passing and repassing. In the language of pleading, a party can only justify passing along, and not being in, a highway.\nIn 1 Roll. Abr. 392 tit. \"Chimin\", cited in Halsbury (2nd Edition) Vol. 16 page 238, it is said:\u2014\nIn a highway the King hath but the passage for himself and his people.\nIn Ex Parte Lewis[57], Wills J. said:\u2014\nThe only 'dedication' in the legal sense that we are aware of is that of a public right of passage, .of which the legal descniption is a 'right for all her Majesty's subjects at all seasons of the year freely and at their will to pass and repass without let or hindrance. I agree with the submission of counsel for the intervenant that a member of the public has no legal right in or on a highway beyond such right to pass and repass and that the use of the highway for other purposes is a mater not of right but of tolerance. In Ex Parte Lewis (supra) at page 197, Wills J. says:\u2014\nThings are done every day, in every part of the kingdom, without let or hindrance, which there is not and cannot be a legal right to do, and not unfrequently are submitted to with a good grace because they are in their nature incapable, by whatever amount of user, of growing into a right.\nIt appears to me to follow from the judgments in O'Brien v. Allen (supra) and Provincial Secretary of Prince Edward Island v. Egan (supra) that the legislative authority to permit, forbid or regulate the use of the highways for purposes other than that of passing and repassing belongs to the Province.\nDealing next with the subject of police regulations and the suppression of conditions likely to cause disorder, it appears that this Court has decided that the Province has power to legislate in relation to such manners.\nIn Bedard v. Dawson[58], Idington J. said:\u2014\nAs to the argument addressed to us that the local legislatures cannot legislate to prevent crime, I cannot assent thereto for in a very wide sense it is the duty of the legislature to do the utmost it can within its power to anticipate and remove, so far as practicable, whatever is likely to tend to produce crime;\nand on the same page he continued:\u2014\nThere are many instances of other nuisances which can be better rectified by local legislation within the power of the legislatures over property and civil rights than by designating them crimes and leaving them to be dealt with by Parliament as such.\nAt the same page Duff J., as he then was, said:\u2014\nThe legislation impugned seems to be aimed at suppressing conditions calculated to favour the development of crime rather than at the punishment of crime. This is an aspect of the subject in respect of which the provinces seem to be free to legislate.\nIn Reference re the Children's Protection Act of Ontario[59], Sir Lyman Duff C.J., delivering the unanimous opinion of the Court said at page 403:\u2014\nMoreover, while, as subject matter of legislation, the criminal law is entrusted to the Dominion Parliament, responsibility for the administra\u00adtion of justice and, broadly speaking, for the policing of the country, the execution of the criminal law, the suppression of crime and disorder, has from the beginning of Confederation been recognized as the responsibility of the provinces and has been discharged at great cost to the people; so also, the provinces, sometimes acting directly, sometimes through the municipalities, have assumed responsibility for controlling social conditions having a tendency to encourage vice and crime.\nReference may also be made to the decision of the Judicial Committee in Lymburn v. Mayland[60].\nIt follows from these authorities that it is within the competence of the Legislature of the Province to prohibit or regulate the distribution, in the streets of the munici\u00adpalities in the Province, of written matter having a ten\u00addency to insult or annoy the recipients thereof with the possible result of giving rise to disorder, and perhaps violence, in the streets.\nIt is said, however, if I have correctly apprehended the argument for the appellant, that even if the legislation in question appears prima facie to fall within the powers of the Provincial Legislature under the two heads with which I have dealt above it is in reality an enactment destructive of the freedom of the press and the freedom of religion both of which are submitted to be matters as to which the Prov\u00adince has no power to legislate. In support of such submission counsel referred to a large number of cases decided in the Courts .of the United States of America but I am unable to derive any assistance from them as they appear to be founded on provisions in the Constitution limiting the power to make laws in relation to such matters. Under the British North America Act, on the other hand, the whole range of legislative power is committed either to Parliament or the Provincial Legislatures and competence to deal with any subject matter must exist in one or other of such bodies. There are thus no rights possessed by the citizens of Canada which cannot be modified by either Parliament or the Legislature, but it may often be a matter of difficulty to decide which of such bodies has the legislative power in a particular case. It will be convenient to first examine the appellant's argument in so far as it deals with the freedom of the press. In Blackstone's Commentaries (1769) Vol. 4, at pages 151 and 152 it is said:\u2014\nThe liberty of the press is indeed essential to the nature of a free state: but this consists in laying no previous restraints upon publications, and not in freedom from censure for criminal matter when published. Every freeman has an undoubted right to lay what sentiments he pleases before the public: to forbid this, is to destroy the freedom of the press: but if he publishes what is improper, mischievous, or illegal, he must take the consequence of his, own temerity. To subject the press to the restrictive power of a licenser, as was formerly done, both before and since the revolution, is to subject all freedom of sentiment to the pre\u00adjudices of one man, and make him the arbitrary and infallible judge of all controverted points in learning, religion, and government. But to punish (as the law does at present) any dangerous or offensive writings, which, when published, shall on a fair and impartial trial be adjudged of a pernicious tendency, is necessary for the preservation of peace and good order, of government said religion, the only solid foundations of civil liberty.\nAccepting this as an accurate description of what is com\u00admonly understood by the expression \"the liberty of the press\", as heretofore enjoyed by the inhabitants of Canada, it is clear that By-law No. 184 does infringe such liberty to a limited extent. It does, to adapt the words of Blackstone, lay some previous restraint upon publication. So far as the by-law is concerned every individual is left free to print and publish any matter he pleases except that one particular method of publication is conditionally denied to him. He is forbidden to publish such matter by distribut\u00ading it in the streets of the City of Quebec without having previously obtained for so doing the written permission of the Chief of Police. I will assume, as is argued for the appellant, that the by-law contemplates that the Chief of Police will examine the written matter in respect of which he is asked to grant a permit and that his decision, whether to grant or refuse it, will be based on the view which he takes of the contents of such matter; that if he regards it as harmless, he will grant the permit, and that if he thinks it is calculated to provoke disorder by annoying or insulting those to whom it is distributed he will refuse the permit. It is urged that power to restrict the liberty of the press even to the limited extent provided in the by-law, is committed exclusively to Parliament under the opening words of section 91 or under head 27 of that section and further that Parliament has fully occupied the field by enacting those provisions of the Criminal Code which deal with blas\u00adphemous libel, seditious libel, speaking seditious words, spreading false news, defamatory libel, and publishing obscene matter. If I have followed the argument cor\u00adrectly, it is that as Parliament has enacted that certain publications are to be deemed criminal it has by implication declared that all other publications are lawful and that con\u00adsequently the Legislature has no power to deal with any other type of publication. I am unable to accept this conclusion.\nIn my view, freedom of the press is not a separate sub\u00adject matter committed exclusively to either Parliament or the Legislatures. In some respects, Parliament, and in others, the Legislatures may validly deal with it. In some aspects it falls within the field of criminal law, but in others it has been dealt with by Provincial legislation, the validity of which is not open to question, as for example \"The Libel and Slander Act\" R.S.O. 1950 Cap. 204, and the similar acts in the other provinces. If the subject matter of a Provincial enactment falls within the class of subjects enumerated in section 92 of the British North America Act such enactment does not, in my opinion, cease to be intra vires of the legislature by reason of the fact that it has the effect of cutting down the freedom of the press. The ques\u00adtion of legislative competence is to be determined not by inquiring whether the enactment lays a previous restraint upon publication or attaches consequences after publication has occurred but rather by inquiring whether in substance the subject matter dealt with falls within the Provincial power. I have already indicated my view that the Prov\u00adince has power under the two headings which I have discussed above to authorize the passing of the by-law in question.\nIt is next necessary to consider the argument that the by-law is invalid because, as it is alleged, it interferes with freedom of religion. While it was questioned before us, I will, for the purposes of this argument, assume that the system of faith and worship professed by the body to which the plaintiff belongs is a religion, and that the distribution of printed matter in the streets is a practice directed by its teachings. It may well be that Parliament alone has power to make laws in relation to the subject of religion as such, that that subject is, in its nature, one which concerns Canada as a whole and so cannot be regarded as of a merely local or private nature in any province or as a civil right in any province; but we are not called upon to decide that ques\u00adtion in this appeal and I express no opinion upon it. I think it clear that the provinces, legislating within their allotted sphere, may affect the carrying on of activities con\u00adnected with the practice of religion. For example, there are many municipal by-laws in force in cities in Ontario, passed pursuant to powers conferred by the Provincial Legislature, which provide that no buildings other than private resi\u00addences shall be erected on certain streets. Such by-laws are, in my opinion, clearly valid although they prevent any religious body from building a church or similar edifice on such streets. Another example of Provincial Legislation which might be said to interfere directly with the free exer\u00adcise of religious profession is that under which the by-law considered in Re Cribbin v. The City of Toronto[61] was passed. That was a by-law of the City of Toronto which provided in part:\u2014\nNo person shall on the Sabbath-day, in any public park, square, garden, or place for exhibition in the city of Toronto, publicly preach lecture or declaim.\nThe by-law was attacked on the ground, inter alia, that it was unconstitutional but it was upheld by Galt C.J. and in my opinion, his decision was right. No useful purpose would be served by endeavouring to define the limits of the provincial power to pass legislation affecting the carrying on of activities connected with the practice of religion. The better course is, I think, to deal only with the particular legislation now before us.\nFor the appellant, reliance was placed upon the Statute of Canada (1851) 14-15 Victoria, Chapter 175, re-enacted in substantially identical terms as R.S.Q. 1941 Cap. 307. I will assume, for the purposes of the argument, that counsel for the appellant is right in his submission that it is to the pre-Confederation Statute that we should look. In the relevant portion of that statute it is enacted:\u2014\nThat the free exercise and enjoyment of Religious Profession and Worship, without discrimination or preference, so as the same be not made an excuse for acts of licentiousness, or a justification of practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the Province, is by the constitu\u00adtion and laws of this Province allowed to all Her Majesty's subjects within the same.\nI do not think that, on a proper construction, this statute absolves a religious body or an individual member thereof from obedience to any Act of Parliament or of the Legis\u00adlature which happens to conflict with the teachings of such body. To give an example, if I am right in my view that Re Cribbin v. City of Toronto (supra) was rightly decided I do not think that an individual could have successfully argued that the by-law, although otherwise valid, did not apply to him because it was one of his beliefs and a teach\u00ading of the body to which he belonged that he must preach not only in churches, chapels or meeting houses or on private property but also in parks and public places.\nIt is argued, on the authority of Dobie v. Temporalities Board[62], that the Legislature could not repeal this pre-Confederation Statute. I will assume that this is so but I think it clear from the opinions delivered in this Court in Reference In Re Bowaters Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd.[63], in which Dobie v. Temporalities Board was fully considered, that although the Province could not repeal the Act in toto it can modify its effects by any subsequent legislation pro\u00advided such legislation is within the field assigned to the Province. Leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant. I therefore do not think that the by-law is rendered invalid by reason of its alleged interference with the right of the appellant to practise the religion of his choice.\nTo summarize, I am of opinion that it was within the competence of the Legislature to authorize the passing of the by-law in question under its power to legislate in relation to (i) the use of highways, and (ii) police regulations and the suppression .of conditions likely to cause disorder; and that such legislation is not rendered invalid because it interferes to the limited extents indicated, above with either the freedom of the press or the freedom of religion. It follows that I would dismiss the appeal. Before parting with the matter, I wish, at the risk of repetition, to emphasize that, because of the position taken by counsel at the argument, I am deciding only that it was within the power of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec to authorize the City to pass the by-law in question. I have not considered whether the relevant legislation did actually authorize its passing as that question was with-drawn from our consideration and counsel for the respon\u00addent and intervenant were not called upon to deal with it. I wish also to make it plain that I do not intend, by implica\u00adtion or otherwise, to express any opinion as to whether or not it would have been within the powers of the Legis\u00adlature to authorize the passing of a similar by-law which was not, as I have held the one before us to be, limited in its operation to what may be done in the streets.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the Appellant: Sam S.

These certificates could be purchased outright or by periodic payments. The holder of these certificates could exchange them for Trust Shares which in turn could be disposed of on the market. Fees were charged by the respondent on these transactions. During the taxation years in question, the respondent was unable to buy the American securities required to create new \"blocks\" or \"units\" against which further Trust Shares could be issued. Consequently, in order to foe able to make further sales of certificates and to meet the requirements of deferred sales already made, the respondent was forced to re-purchase Trust Shares from holders desiring to dispose of them. The profits realized when these re-purchased Trust Shares were sold at prices in excess of their cost to the respondent were assessed by the Minister but held to be not taxable by the Exchequer Court.\nHeld (reversing the judgment appealed from), that the dealings in the Trust Shares were part of the respondent's business and the profits, therefore, taxable.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1, Sydney Smith, Deputy Judge, holding that the amounts received by the respondent in the years 1943, 1944, 1945 and 1946 from the sale of Independence Founders Trust Shares were not income.\nW. R. Jackett Q.C. and F. J. Cross for the appellant.\nJ. L. Lawrence for the respondent.\nRand J. :\u2014The business structure of the respondent consisted of transactions of the following type. A block or unit of selected stocks was purchased and, along with certain money for incidental purposes, deposited with a trust company which I shall call trust company A. Against that unit 2,000 trust shares represented by appropriate transferable certificates were issued to the respondent. These trust shares, in turn, were placed by the respondent in the custody of a second or trust company B, and against them investment certificates were issued, representing fractional interests in one or more trust shares according to the amount paid by an investor. The sale of the certificates was carried on by the respondent and as can be seen, the business lent itself to a wide scale diffusion of small investment. Provision for contract purchases by periodic payments was contained in the certificates. The holder of a sufficient number was entitled to require trust company B to redeem them in cash by way of sale at the current price or to deliver to him their equivalent in trust shares; the holders of trust shares could require their redemption in cash or, in lots of not less than 400, the surrender of stock share certificates of equivalent value. New units might from time to time be deposited with trust company A, followed in turn by the issue of trust shares and investment certificates.\nThe obligations of the respondent were to manage the original investment units which entailed a continuing rapport with market conditions and such substitutions in the shares as might be necessary to preserve the balance in the investments looking to soundness and stability of value; and to maintain sufficient trust shares with trust company B to meet all purchases, present or contracted. The respondent was entitled to a percentage fee for supervising investments and various other fees payable on the sale of trust shares and investment certificates. Fees were payable also to the trust companies.\nThe shares specified for unit purchases included a number of United States securities, but in the period from 1943 to 1946 dealings in them became difficult by reason of the Foreign Exchange Control regulations. In order, therefore, to meet unexecuted contract purchases of investment certificates, the respondent was obliged to purchase trust shares on the Canadian markets, and this it did on a substantial scale during the taxation years 1943, 1944, 1945 and 1946.\nThe dispute is whether profits accruing to the respondent from those dealings are taxable. The contention is that since the respondent was under an obligation to maintain a certain capital with trust company B as the subject matter of value represented by the investment certificates, it was not in the position of an ordinary broker; that it was carrying out only an obligation related to capital; and that any resulting increase in value realized is an accretion to capital and not income.\nI am unable to attribute to that obligation the effect claimed by Mr. Lawrence. The business of the respondent was one and entire and the profits of a business may consist in what are in one sense capital gains as well as what is strictly income. The business being an entirety, it embraced all those relations, obligations and responsibilities with which its activities were bound up. The duty to keep trust company B supplied with trust shares was just one feature of it. The necessity for maintaining the security followed from the respondent's mode of disposing of investment certificates; if it had not invited contract purchases, the necessity would not have arisen ; and the fact that the Exchange Regulations entered into the matter cannot affect the nature of its dealings.\nSmith J. 2 states the essence of his judgment against the Crown in these words:\u2014\nWhat have been assessed in this case are the increases in market value of securities that have been lying passive in the appellant's (respondent's) hands. Appellant claims that these increases in value are capital increments and not income at all; the Minister claims that they constitute a profit in a commodity that it is the appellant's business to deal in, and so are income within the relevant acts.\nAnd he proceeds:\u2014\nAs I have said, the appellant has neither profits nor loss on securities while they are the subjects of deals with clients. Though it can gain or lose on securities that are lying passive in its hands, it is as liable to lose as to win, according to the general market \u2026 The effect of all this is that, though buying and selling interests in securities are essential to the appellant's business, these transactions are not its livelihood. In fact, with regard to these transactions the appellant is in much the position of a broker relying on commissions. It is only on fluctuations on the market for shares not being bought or sold that appellant can make a profit. It does not seek the profit, which is just as likely to be a loss. If profit, it is a fortunate profit.\nHe likens these securities in the hands of the respondent to timberlands held by a logging company, and rejects the view that in contrast to that situation, here there is a case of dealing in securities and that they are bought for resale. This he does not think \"necessarily enough to attach the tax.\"\nNo doubt increases in market value accrue while securities are retained in the respondent's hands, but obviously as such they have not been taxed : it is the profit made on selling them that is in question.\nHe uses the analogy also of maintaining a picture gallery for exhibition purposes only, intended to be supported by admission charges. To sustain the interest of patrons, the proprietor may be obliged to keep the collection revolving and in that way keep buying and selling pictures even though he has no desire to be a dealer and though he is \"as likely to lose as to gain by his dealings\", and he adds:\u2014\nSimlarly the appellant keeps securites not as a dealer but as an inducement to persuade clients to buy and to pay it commissions. These securities are like the tools of a trade ; the user of tools must keep replacing them and may be lucky enough to have them rise in value after replacement; but I quite fail to see how the increase could be treated as income.\nBut, apart altogether from the question of taxability of the art dealer, is the analogy valid? From the initial purchase of stock shares down to the special purchase of trust shares the respondent bought for the specific purpose of reselling by means of investment certificates. The purchase of the trust shares was to protect outstanding contracts but, in effect, by way of resale as instalments were paid. But the exhibitor did not buy pictures for the purpose of resale, even though the course of his business might from time to time require a change of exhibits. The trial judge appears to disregard the obligation to maintain trust share value to meet outstanding contracts; but, in the circumstances, the respondent was bound to make the purchases as part of the transactions under which the contract sales of interests were made: these features cannot be separated.\nOnce all contracts or sales have been concluded, the respondent can, in a sense, be said to stand by as manager or servicing agent of a trust structure in which the legal and beneficial interests in the property are vested in other persons. The possibility exists that the entire beneficial interests might be converted into the original legal interests and the total structure disappear, but that is not what is contemplated; and a complete liquidation is provided for at the end of twenty years. But the duties of management, the responsibilities associated with redeemed or exchanged certificates or trust shares, the interest of an increasing body of distributed investment: all these, as well as other incidental features, such as that which actually developed in 1943, remain at the charge and for the benefit of the respondent. What was in the minds of those who set this scheme on foot was a business of expanding and recurring transactions of purchase and sale within the period mentioned. The income from the transactions in question, forming part of this totality, whether profits or fees, is taxable income.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal, restore the assessment and dismiss the appeal to the Exchequer Court with costs in both courts. Kellock J.:\u2014In the course of its business the respondent company purchases securities which it deposits in \"units\" or \"blocks\" with the Royal Trust Company, receiving from that company \"trust shares\", all as provided for in the agreement relating to this part of the business. These trust shares are, in turn, under the terms of a further agreement, deposited with the Prudential Trust Company and certificates representing an interest in the trust shares are-sold as investments to clients of the respondent. Some of the contracts represented' by these certificates cover immediate purchases while others provide for deferred purchases. The holders of certificates are entitled to present them to the Prudential Company at any time and to receive in exchange their value in trust shares or in cash.\nDuring the years here in question the respondent, as a result of a change in circumstances which need not be specified, was no longer able to acquire satisfactory securities for the purpose of making deposits with the Royal Trust Company. The respondent accordingly found it necessary to purchase the trust shares which the Prudential Trust Company from time to time were called upon by holders of certificates to realize upon, in order that the respondent might thus be in a position to make further sales of certificates or to meet the deposit requirements of deferred sales already made. From such transactions the respondent realized profits which the Crown claims represent taxable income but which the respondent claims represent capital gains.\nThe argument on behalf of the respondent is that its real business is the making of the fees provided for under the agreements, namely, for its services with respect to the management of the underlying securities deposited with the Royal Trust Company as well as the various other fees provided for by the agreements upon the issue and surrender of trust shares and certificates. As to the transactions in question, the respondent contends it did not enter into them with the intention of making profit and that this factor is determinative of the character, for taxation purposes, of the profits which are the subject of these proceedings. In my opinion this contention is insupportable. The dealings in the trust shares were an essential part of the business in which the respondent company was engaged. Without them, what the respondent calls its main business would have been very much contracted if not brought completely to an end. The principle stated by Lord Maugham in Punjab Co-operative Bank v. Income Tax Commissioner 3, in words used in the California Copper case 4, is applicable, namely,\nenhanced values obtained from realization or conversion of securities may be so assessable, where what is done is not merely a realization or change of investment, but an act done in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying out, of a business.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout.\nEstey, J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a decision in the Exchequer Court 5 holding that the amounts received by the respondent in each of the years 1943, 1944, 1945 and 1946 from the sale of Independence Founders Trust Shares (hereinafter referred to as Trust Shares) were not income within the meaning of the Income War Tax Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, and amendments thereto) and the Excess Profits Tax Act (S. of C. 1940, c. 32). The appellant here contends that these amounts were income as denned in these statutes and taxable under the provisions thereof.\nThe respondent, Independence Founders Limited, incorporated under the laws of British Columbia in 1933, invested its capital in Canadian and American securities which, under the terms of an agreement made between it and the Royal Trust Company dated January 1, 1936, were deposited in units or blocks with the Royal Trust Company as trustee. When so deposited these securities were registered in the name of the Royal Trust Company as trustee, which issued to the respondent Trust Shares, each Trust Share representing a 1\/2000th undivided interest in the unit or block of securities.\nThe respondent, under the terms of an agreement made with the Prudential Trust Company Limited dated March 23, 1933, as amended April 1, 1936, sold trustee investment certificates to persons desiring to invest in Trust Shares, either on a cash or time basis, and deposited with the Prudential Trust Company Limited the Trust Shares. These certificates, signed by the respondent, certified that the investor was the registered holder of the \"Investment Certificate evidencing and embodying an agreement for Investment in Trust Shares.\" Upon each certificate the Prudential Trust Company Limited certified that the investor named therein was registered at the office of the Prudential as holder of the certificate. When the investor had paid one or more instalments he had a right, under the terms of the investment certificate, to surrender that certificate and to be paid in cash the value thereof. The investor who held his certificate until maturity might exercise certain other options not material to the present issues.\nUnder the foregoing the respondent's income was derived only from certain charges provided for in the agreement under which the investor bought the Trust Shares.\nIn 1943 Foreign Exchange Control Board regulations first restricted and then prohibited the purchase of United States securities. Thereafter it was impossible for the respondent to purchase United States securities and create further units or blocks of Canadian and United States securities to be deposited with the Royal Trust Company upon which the latter would issue further Trust Shares. The respondent's position then was as stated in its factum:\nTo stay in business the Respondent abandoned its former practice of selling securities whenever an Investor wished to cash in and instead paid him in cash.\nor, as stated by respondent's Managing Director, Mr. Barker, in referring to the situation after the Foreign Exchange Control Board regulations came into force :\nYes, it was different, in that the requirements now had to be principally filled by the redemption of old accounts\u2014accounts that were surrendered. We provided the principal part of the trusteed property that was allocated; whereas prior the principal part of which property as we were doing business and opening new accounts came through acquiring an underlying unit with the trust company, creating new trust shares.\nThe company had the power to purchase and sell these Trust Shares and did so by exercising its option to purchase Trust Shares from those who desired to surrender same. Mr. Barker agreed that the dealing in these Trust Shares was thereafter a necessary part of the business of the corn- : pany. It would, therefore, seem that at least in part its business was the buying and selling of Trust Shares. Each purchase and subsequent sale was carried out at the market value of these shares on the day of the respective transactions. In each of the years the company benefited by the fact that the sales totalled an amount greater than the purchase price. In other words, while the Trust Shares were in respondent's hands they appreciated in value in each of the years as follows:\n1943 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 $ 7,498.89\n1944 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 10,876.05\n1945 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 11,798.96\n1946 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 20,727.15\nThe relevant difference in the nature and character of respondent's business after the Foreign Exchange Control Board regulations prohibited purchase of American securities may be summarized as follows: Prior thereto when an investor desired to surrender and realize the cash value of his trust shares the respondent complied with his request-by selling underlying securities. The respondent would then purchase additional underlying securities upon which new Trust Shares would be issued. Under this procedure any fluctuation of the value of the Trust Shares was entirely a loss or gain to the investor. This procedure was abandoned after the Foreign Exchange Control Board regulations came into force. The respondent would then, when the investor desired to surrender and realize the cash value of his Trust Shares, exercise its option to purchase these, which it did in its own right at the current market value, for the purpose of selling or allocating them subsequently to other investors at the then current market price. In the interval between the purchase and sale the Trust Shares were the property of the respondent and it profited or lost according as the Trust Shares fluctuated upwards or downwards.\nThe respondent, however, contends that the \"Trust Shares are only title to these securities which still remain capital\" and \"What the Respondent did was to allocate an interest in the securities to an investor and thereafter manage his interest for him. What was capital in its hands became capital of the investor.\" The Trust Shares represented a claim to an undivided interest in the underlying securities. (In certain events not material hereto an investor might, at maturity of the contract, surrender his shares and obtain a proportionate share of the underlying securities.) The title to the underlying securities at all times material hereto remained in the Royal Trust Company as trustee. The respondent, in purchasing these shares, was in reality purchasing the investor's contractual undivided interest in the underlying securities. In these circumstances this is not a sale of a capital asset such as a timber limit purchased by a logging company for the extraction of timber, nor of pictures of an art collector who charges fees for admission to his gallery, nor the instruments of a music teacher used in giving lessons, nor the automobiles of a taxi company. It is rather the purchase of these Trust Shares for the purpose of reselling them at such time as the investor's payments might require them.\nThe amounts here in question would seem to have been realized in the ordinary course of the respondent's business and taxable as income within the meaning of the oft-quoted statement of Lord Justice Clerk in Californian Copper Syndicate v. Harris 6:\nIt is quite a well settled principle in dealing with questions of assessment of Income Tax, that where the owner of an ordinary investment chooses to realise it, and obtains a greater price for it than he originally acquired it at, the enhanced price is not profit in the sense of Schedule D of the Income Tax Act of 1842 assessable to Income Tax. But it is equally well established that enhanced values obtained from realisation or conversion of securities may be so assessable, where what is done is not merely a realisation or change of investment, but an act done in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying out, of a business.\nThe part of the foregoing statement material to this discussion was quoted with approval by Duff J. (later C.J.) in the judgment of this Court in Merritt Realty Company. Limited v. Brown 7, where the revenue realized by a private company from the sale of real estate was held not to be accretions to capital but rather profit realized by the company in carrying out a scheme for profit-making. As Duff J. stated at p. 189:\nWhen the facts proved are taken into consideration, there seems to me no real ground for doubting that the properties in which the company dealt were acquired for the purpose of turning them to account to the profit of the company, by sale, if necessary. See also Atlantic Sugar Refineries Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue 8.\nIn Punjab Co-operative Bank Ltd. v. Commissioners of Income Tax 9, where the bank sold its securities in order to provide funds to meet the withdrawals of its depositors, it was stated:\nIt seems to their Lordships to be quite clear that this is a normal step in carrying on the banking business; in other words, that it is an act done in what is truly the carrying on of the banking business.\nThe respondent's counsel cites a passage of Lord Buck-master in Ducker v. Rees Roturbo Development Syndicate 10. In that case the company was formed for the purpose of purchasing and acquiring patents but without any intention of manufacturing thereunder. The company disposed of patent rights to a United States company which agreed to pay royalties with the option to purchase same. The American company did purchase them and the sum in question of 26,500 pounds represented royalty and purchase price. The company contended that their share of this sum, less proper expenses, represented the sale of a capital asset and that the proceeds arising therefrom should not be brought into account. In the passage quoted Lord Buckmaster, following Californian Copper Syndicate v. Harris, supra, held the sum to be taxable and, concluding his judgment, His Lordship stated at p. 141 :\nIt is one of the foreign patents with which this appeal has to do, and the agreements, which are set out, showing the way in which the foreign patents in the case of France and of Canada have also been dealt with, show that that statement was not a statement of a mere accidental dealing with a particular class of property, but that it was part of their business which, though not of necessity the line on which they desired their business most extensively to develop, was one which they were prepared to undertake.\nThe fact that under this plan for the selling of Trust Shares, prior to Foreign Exchange Control Board regulations becoming effective, respondent's income was derived from the deductions provided for under the terms of the contract upon which the investor purchased Trust Shares does not militate against the fact that revenue earned when the method of providing Trust Shares to the investor is varied may be held to be income within the meaning of the aforementioned statutes. The buying and selling by the respondent of the Trust Shares here in question was a necessary part of respondent's business as developed after the aforementioned regulations became effective and the revenue derived therefrom was income within the meaning of the above-mentioned statutes.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nLocke, J.:\u2014The business of the respondent company during the four yearly taxation periods in question was the sale of what were designated as Investment Certificates, by which the purchasers acquired either outright or upon the completion of a series of payments a defined undivided interest in shares of stock held by the Royal Trust Company, pursuant to the terms of an agreement entered into between that company and the respondent dated January 1, 1936. In respect of the shares so deposited the Royal Trust Company issued what were called Independence Founders Trust Shares representing, in the terms of the agreement, \"an undivided interest in such deposited stocks and other property.\"\nThe Investment Certificates acquired by the purchasers (referred to therein as investors) were issued by the respondent and each was endorsed with a statement signed by Prudential Trust Company Limited, declaring that the named person was registered at the office of the trustee as the holder of the certificate.\nThe Investment Certificates were of two kinds: one, a fully paid certificate which acknowledged the payment to the Prudential Trust Company Limited, 'as trustee, of a lump sum : the other which recited that the purchaser had made an initial payment and would pay further payments of an amount specified thereafter at stated intervals and that, upon making these payments, the purchaser should become the beneficial owner of what was designated the \"Trusteed Property\", to the extent that the payment, less certain deductions, would purchase such property at the price prevailing at the close of business on the day the funds were received. The \"Trusteed Property\" was, by the terms of the agreement, to consist of Trust Shares issued by the Royal Trust Company pursuant to the terms of the agreement first above mentioned. It was one of the terms of the Investment Certificates that the purchasers might surrender their certificates and obtain the value of the trust property held for the investor by the Prudential Trust Company Limited, less certain deductions. This value was to be ascertained by determining the then market value of the shares of stock held by the Royal Trust Company and referred to in the Trust Shares which had been purchased with the investors' money, a value which, of necessity, would fluctuate.\nBy the terms of an agreement made between the respondent and the Prudential Trust Company Limited, dated March 23, 1933, as amended by a further agreement dated April 1, 1936, the respondent had agreed at the outset to deposit with that trust company an initial amount of fifty of the Trust Shares, a number which represented a one-fortieth undivided interest in one group of the shares held by the Royal Trust Company. Such groups of shares were referred to in the agreement under which the deposit was made by the respondent with the Royal Trust Company as a stock unit. As payments were made by purchasers under Investment Certificates, the Prudential Trust Company Limited agreed to purchase Trust Shares from the respondent at their current value determined as aforesaid. In the event of the respondent not having Trust Shares available for that purpose when so required, it was provided that the Prudential Trust Company Limited might purchase them from the Royal Trust Company. The agreement further provided that, if and when any of the holders of either class of the Investment Certificates exercised the option to surrender his certificate and take the value of the Trust Shares held on his behalf, the Trust Company would sell such interest and, after making certain defined deductions, pay the amount realized to the owner of the surrendered certificate.\nThe units of shares deposited with the Royal Trust Company included shares in American companies and, owing to foreign exchange regulations during the time in question, the respondent could not obtain the necessary American exchange to buy shares in such companies in order to constitute new stock units with the Royal Trust Company. The result of this was that, in order to continue its business of the sale of Investment Certificates, the respondent acquired Trust Shares by purchases from the holders of Investment Certificates wishing to surrender them and take the value of the securities held. The taxation period which ended on April 30, 1943, is typical of the four annual periods in question. When the respondent was notified of the assessment made upon it in respect of that period, it filed with the Minister a notice of dissatisfaction and an accompanying statement of facts. This statement, after referring to the arrangements made with the Royal Trust Company for the issuing of the Trust Shares and the manner in which the taxpayer issued the Investment Certificates to purchasers providing that if the purchasers of these certificates wished to sell their Independence Founders Trust Shares the taxpayer was required to take them over at the price thereof as of that day, said in part:\u2014\nAs stated above each portfolio comprises a list of selected Canadian and American securities. Upon the coming into force of the Foreign Exchange Control Act the Appellant was prevented by the Regulations from acquiring American Securities to form further portfolios or units. It therefore became necessary for the Appellant to find some means of acquiring Trusteed Property to complete outstanding contracts and this was accomplished by permitting the Prudential Trust Company to hold and apply shares acquired from clients who exercised their right to liquidate. During the taxation period the Appellant thus acquired approximately 24,987 Trust Shares and of the said shares so acquired 22,930 were allocated by the Trustee to satisfy the terms of existing contracts. The difference between the price of the shares so acquired and the price at which the same were so allocated (being the sum of $7,912.90) is claimed by the Minister as income, on the ground that it is a profit on Trading in Securities.\nIt would have been more accurate had the statement said that the Prudential Trust Company Limited acted on behalf of the present respondent in acquiring Trust Shares from investors who elected to surrender their Investment Certificates and that the shares so acquired enabled the respondent to sell further Investment Certificates and remain in business. That a profit was made during this period is admitted. The manner in which it was made was that the Trust Shares so acquired from investors were sold to the purchasers of Investment Certificates at amounts greater than their cost to the respondent, due, no doubt, to the increase in the value of the underlying shares.\nHad the respondent sold Independence Founders Trust Shares directly to the public for amounts in excess of their cost to it, its liability to taxation upon the resulting income would, in my opinion, have been undoubted. I do not think the fact that, instead of doing so, the plan of selling these shares through the medium of the Investment Certificates upon terms requiring the respondent to repurchase the shares at the owners' election was adopted alters the situation. The respondent in this matter during the taxation periods in question was, in my opinion, in the same position as the seller of any other commodity. What it offered for sale was simply an undivided interest in the shares deposited with the Royal Trust Company, the title to which was evidenced by the Trust Share Certificates. The method of selling these interests in the form of Investment Certificates enabled the respondent to earn certain fees for services, which were deducted from the purchase moneys paid by the investors to the Trust Company. In addition, the Trust Shares purchased by the respondent in the year 1943 were resold at prices in excess of their cost to the respondent and their acquisition and sale and the resulting profit were, in my opinion, part of the business and the income from it, just as were the rendering of services and the fees earned for such services. The fact that the respondent obligated itself to the investors to repurchase their Trust Shares if they wished to liquidate their holdings does not appear to me to affect the matter. The shares were sold at a price calculated in the manner above stated and, if at the time the investor elected to sell his Trust Shares, the then value of such shares was in excess of the amount which the respondent had received from their sale, the resulting loss would properly be taken into account in determining the respondent's income for that year.\nIn the years following 1943 the respondent had on hand at the end of its fiscal years Trust Shares acquired through the Prudential Trust Company Limited in the manner above described which had not yet been sold and the appellant complains of the value placed upon these shares by the Department of National Revenue. The audited accounts of the respondent for the taxation periods in question showed that they were kept upon an accrual basis and the evidence satisfies me that the valuations placed upon them by the Department were determined in accordance with recognized accounting practice. I would allow this appeal with costs throughout and restore the assessments made by the Minister of National Revenue.\nCartwright J.:\u2014I agree that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the gains which accrued to the respondent from the purchase and sale of the trust shares described in the reasons of other members of the Court were properly assessable as profits received by it from the carrying on of its business.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout and restore the assessments made by the appellant.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

The Supreme Court restored the judgments of the trial judge by Which responsibility for the collision was placed entirely on the Tramway Company by reason of the negligence of its motorman. However, the judgment of the Queen's Bench was affirmed as to the amount of damages to which the husband was entitled for loss of his wife's services and companionship as a result of the injuries sustained by her. The judgment of the Court was delivered by Kerwin J., who with reference to that point said:\u2014\nA question arises as to the amount of damages to which Deeks is entitled. It is emphasized that we deal with this point as it was presented in argument. The trial judge fixed the damages at $7,805.81, of which amount the Insurance Company was subrogated to his rights to the extent of $1,000 and judgment was therefore given at the trial for $6,805.81. Deeks admitted that $360 should be deducted and on April 15, 1951, filed a partial desistment for that amount. In addition to reducing the trial judgment by that amount, the Court of Queen's Bench also deducted $214. This was on the ground that \"the (Deeks) children had been in the habit of going to summer camps and the disability of Mrs. Deeks in no way increased the expenses in that connection.\" With that we agree.\nA further deduction by the Court of Queen's Bench of $1,000 arose in this way. Deeks claimed damages for the loss of services and companionship of his wife during her period of total disability and also for loss of her services and companionship resulting from her permanent partial incapacity. The trial judge allowed $3,000 in all to cover these claims. The Court of Queen's Bench reduced this to $2,000 on the ground that there was no evidence in the record that a wife's obligations in Ontario extended to helping her husband in his business dealings. The evidence on the subject of the rights of a husband for the loss of consortium and servitium was given by a barrister and solicitor of the Province of Ontario, the domicile of Mr. and Mrs. Deeks. Nothing was asked that witness about this particular feature although Deeks claimed that before the accident his wife had assisted him by receiving his clients at their home and by joining him in outside entertainment, and that as a result of the accident she was unable to take her accustomed part in these activities. In Best v. Samuel Fox and Co. Ld. [1952] A.C. 716, the House of Lords decided that a married woman whose husband has been injured by a negligent act or omission has no right of action against the negligent person in respect of loss or impairment of consortium consequential on the injury. However, considerable discussion occurred in the arguments of counsel as to the basis of a husband's claim in respect of the loss or impairment of the consortium and servitium of his wife where she had been injured by the negligence of a third party, and reference is made to the subject in some of the judgments. It is unnecessary to consider the basis of such an action because we agree with those who expressed the view that such an action should not be enlarged. Whatever be its foundation and justification, we agree with Mr. Justice MacDougal that there is nothing in the law to justify any allowance by way of damages for such a claim as is advanced by Deeks to cover the $1,000.\nAPPEALS from the judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 2 in several actions arising out of a collision in Montreal between a street car and an ambulance.\nJ.

The deductions were disallowed by the appellant, but on appeal to the Exchequer Court, Cameron J., held that a taxpayer engaged in an integrated business, such as the respondents, had the right to apportion 'his income as between logging and other operations and claim a deduction for the provincial tax paid in respect thereof.\nHeld: (Kerwin and Cartwright JJ. dissenting).\u2014That the type of taxation to which s. 5(1)(w) was directed was provincial taxation specifically imposed on income from mining or logging operations and had no reference to general provincial taxes on income.\nPer: Kerwin and Cartwright JJ., (dissenting, agreed with the trial judge).\u2014The amount which the respondent claimed to be entitled to deduct from its taxable income was imposed by way of tax on income and the income upon which this amount of tax fell was derived from logging operations. It would be a forced construction of the clause to hold that it had no operation in the case of a tax on income which in fact fell upon income derived from logging operations merely because it also fell on the income of the taxpayer from other sources.\nJudgments of the Exchequer Court of Canada [1952] Ex. CE. 68 and 75 set aside and assessment restored. APPEALS from two judgments of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Cameron J 1, allowing the respective appeals of the respondent taxpayers from an assessment for excess profits tax for the year 1947.\nDavid Mundell, Q.C. and T. Z. Boles for the appellant.\nRoderick Johnston, Q.C. and Terence Sheard, Q.C. for Spruce Falls Power & Paper Co. Ltd., respondent.\nJohn Aylen, Q.C. and J. R. Tolmie for James MacLaren Co. Ltd., respondent.\nThe dissenting judgment of Kerwin and Cartwright, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nCartwright J. (dissenting):\u2014These appeals were argued together and raise the same questions relating to taxes demanded on income for the 1947 taxation year. To make clear what these questions are it will be sufficient to refer briefly to the facts in the case of the first appeal.\nThe respondent Spruce Falls Power and Paper Company Limited carries on the business of manufacturing and selling sulphite pulp and newsprint paper. It has the right to cut the timber on extensive limits in the Province of Ontario. It conducts logging operations on these limits in the course of which it cuts the standing timber into pulp-wood logs which it transports to its mill at Kapuskasing, Ontario. At the mill these logs are processed or manufactured into sulphite pulp and newsprint paper. The business of the appellant is thus a wholly integrated operation, in the course of which it acquires a raw product in its natural state, namely standing timber, and through a series of operations converts such raw product into finished or semi-finished products, namely sulphite pulp and newsprint paper, which it sells to the ultimate consumer thereof. In respect of such business the respondent filed a return under The Corporations Tax Act, 1939, of the Province of Ontario shewing net income for the year ending December 31, 1947 of $5,807,161.33 and tax payable thereon of $406,501.29. In its amended return of Dominion of Canada Income and Excess Profits Taxes for the year ending December 31, 1947, the respondent claimed to deduct from its taxable income 46-36 per cent of the said tax of $406,501.29, i.e. $188,454.00, as being tax on its income derived from logging operations within the meaning of s. 5(1)(w) of The Income War Tax Act and the regulations made thereunder. This deduction was disallowed by the appellant but was allowed in full by the learned trial judge.\nThe two questions which we have to determine are whether the respondent is entitled to any deduction and, if so, whether the amount of the deduction claimed is correctly computed.\nThe answer to the first question turns on the construction of the relevant provisions of the statute and the regulations. The relevant regulations are P.C. 331, dated the 30th of January, 1948 and P.C. 952, dated the 6th of March, 1948 which amended section one of P.C. 331. It is not necessary to repeat their terms. The meaning of the words used construed in their ordinary sense appears to me to be entirely consistent with the view taken by the learned trial judge and indeed I find the construction he has placed upon them a more natural one than that contended for by the appellant.\nAt the time both of the Orders in Council referred to were passed the enabling section under which they were made, s. 5, s-s. 1, paragraph (w) of the Income War Tax Act as amended by 11 Geo. VI c. 63, s. 4, s-s. 5, read as follows:\u2014\n\"Income\" as hereinbefore defined shall for the purpose of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:\u2014\n(w) Such amount as the Governor in Council may, by regulation, allow for amounts paid in respect of taxes imposed on the income, or any part thereof, by the Government of a province by way of tax on income derived from mining operations or income derived from logging operations.\nS-s. 6 of s. 4 of 11 Geo. VI, c. 63, reads as follows:\u2014\n(6) Paragraph (w) of subsection one of section five of the said Act, as enacted by subsection five of this section, is applicable to income of the nineteen hundred and forty-seven and subsequent taxation years and to tax payable thereon but in the case of the nineteen hundred and forty-seven taxation year no amount may be deducted thereunder greater than that proportion of the total amount that might be deducted in respect of the whole taxation year that the number of days in the said taxation year in the calendar year nineteen hundred and forty-seven is of the number of days in the whole of the taxation year. By s. 2(2) of 11 and 12 George VI c. 53, (assented to on June 30, 1948) Paragraph (w) was repealed and the following was substituted therefor:\u2014\n(w) such amount as the Governor in Council may, by regulation, allow in respect of taxes on income for the year from mining or logging operations.\nAs s-s. 6 of s. 4 of 11 Geo. VI, c. 63, quoted above, was not amended it would follow that the expressed intention of Parliament was that paragraph (w) as last enacted should be applicable to income of the 1947 and subsequent taxation years and to tax payable thereon.\nThe appellant contends that the validity of the regulations is to be determined and that they are to be construed, so far as their construction is governed by the terms of the enabling statute, with reference to paragraph (w) as it appeared in the 1947 statute rather than that in the 1948 statute and that whichever statute is applicable gave power to the Governor in Council to allow a deduction from income of taxes on income from logging operations only if such tax was specifically imposed as and expressly limited to a tax on income derived from such operations and that no power was given to enact regulations allowing a deduction in respect of taxes on income from logging operations paid under a taxing statute applying to income generally. The learned trial judge has held that the governing statutory provision is paragraph (w) as enacted in 1948. Mr. Mun-dell argues that this is wrong. His submission is that the paragraph as enacted in 1947 was the only enabling statute in force when the regulations were passed, that their validity must be determined with reference to that section and that if they were not authorized by it they were void and there was nothing upon which s. 20(a) of the Interpretation Act could operate when the 1948 amendment was passed.\nI, at present, incline to the view that Mr. Mundell's argument, in this regard, would be unanswerable in a case in which the amending statute was clearly prospective. The question is rendered difficult by the fact that the 1948 amendment is made retrospective in its operation. Parliament could of course by aptly framed legislation validate regulations which had been previously passed but were for some reason invalid. Parliament is assumed to be familiar with the law and with the orders of the Governor in Council of general application and it is arguable that, when it provided that paragraph (w) as enacted in 1948 should apply to the 1947 taxation year, it intended that the already existing regulations should be deemed to have been passed under the new paragraph. I do not, however, find it necessary to decide this question in this appeal, because if it be assumed, as I will now assume, that the statutory provision to which we should have regard is paragraph (w) as enacted in 1947 I am of opinion that the decision of the learned trial judge was right. It would have been a simple matter for the draftsman of the paragraph to have made it clear that the operation of the section was to be restricted to a tax specifically and exclusively levied on income from logging operations but Parliament has not seen fit to use such words and the words used seem to me to be apt to authorize the regulations passed by the Governor in Council construed as they have been construed by the learned trial judge.\nIt is said for the appellant that the words \"by way of tax on income derived \u2026 from logging operations\" support the construction for which he contends, but in my view the words \"by way of\" are not words of art and the ordinary meaning of the words of the clause taken as a whole seems to me to include the tax here in question. Leaving aside for the moment the question of the accuracy of the computation, it is clear that the $188,454 which the respondent claims to be entitled to deduct from its taxable income was imposed by way of a tax on income and that the income upon which this amount of tax fell was derived from logging operations. It would, I think, be a forced construction of the clause to hold that it has no operation in the case of a tax on income which does in fact fall upon income derived from logging operations merely because it also falls on the income of the taxpayer from other sources.\nI should have arrived at the above conclusion from a consideration of the words of the statute alone and it appears to me to be fortified by a consideration of the following circumstances. As I have said already, Parliament is assumed to know the existing law including the public statutes of the provinces and we are informed by all counsel that there was not in force in any province in the year 1947 any legislation under which a tax was levied on income derived from logging operations which would answer the description of the only sort of tax to which in the appellant's submission clause (w) could have application. It is said for the appellant that this is not significant as the clause and the regulations passed thereunder were intended to look only to the future but if this is so it is difficult to understand why the 1948 amendment was made retrospectively applicable to the 1947 taxation year. So far as logging operations and income derived therefrom are concerned, to adopt the construction for which the appellant contends would have the result of leaving both the legislation and the regulations without subject matter in a year to which they were expressly made applicable. It would further appear that the construction adopted by the learned trial judge avoids, while that contended for by the appellant would bring about, a result involving, to borrow the words of my brother Rand, an apparent discrimination which might seem unjust.\nFor these reasons, even on the assumption that it is to the 1947 form of paragraph (w) that we should look, I agree with the conclusion of the learned trial judge in regard to the first question above mentioned.\nIn regard to the second question, as to whether the amount of the deduction claimed was correctly computed in accordance with the regulations and particularly whether it was computed in accordance with sound accounting principles with reference to the value of the logs at the time of their delivery at the respondent's mill, I am in agreement with the reasons and the conclusion of the learned trial judge.\nI would dismiss both appeals with costs.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Kellock, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKellock J.:\u2014These appeals, which were argued together, involve the construction of s. 5(1)(w) of the Income War Tax Act as enacted by s. 2(2) of c. 53 of the Statutes of 1948, which came into force on June 30 of that year. The question between the parties arises in the determination of the \"net taxable income\" of each company under The Excess Profits Tax Act, which statute, by s. 2(1)(c) of the Second Schedule, makes applicable the provisions of the Income War Tax Act in determining such income. The question of construction which arises in each case is as to whether the words \"in respect of taxes on income for the year from \u2026 logging operations\" in s. 5(1)(w) are limited to a provincial tax imposed specifically on such income, or whether the paragraph contemplates as well, the deduction of a part of a general income tax, apportioned on the basis of the proportion which income from logging bears to total income. In the court below the latter view was taken and the appellant contends that this view is erroneous.\nPrima facie the language of the statute is specific. The deduction authorized is the amount \"in respect of taxes paid to \u2026 a province on income derived from logging operations.\" The respondents' contention really is that this language is to be read as meaning\nin respect of that proportion of taxes paid to a province which corresponds to the proportion which income received from logging bears to the total income taxed.\nBoth parties sought to interpret the legislation by reference to regulations passed under antecedent legislation, as well as by reference to the earlier legislation itself. Counsel for the appellant also referred us to other Dominion and provincial legislation which it was said formed part of a general scheme which included the legislation which is here directly in question.\nS. 5(1) (w) was first enacted in 1946 by s. 41 of c. 55, and came into force on August 31, 1946. As so enacted, the section was as follows:\n5(1) \"Income\" as hereinbefore defined shall for the purpose of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions,\n(w) such amount as the Governor in Council may by regulation allow in respect of taxes paid to the government of a province on income derived from mining or logging operations in the province.\nAt the time of this enactment The Dominion-Provincial Taxation Agreement Act, 1942, 6 George VI, c. 13, and complementary provincial legislation, was in force. The agreements provided for thereby were, as provided by s. 2 of the Dominion statute, in force \"for the duration of the war and for a certain readjustment period thereafter\". In fact, they continued in some cases until the end of the year 1946, and in the remainder until the closing months thereof. Under the terms of these agreements the provinces undertook to repeal or suspend all income and cor- poration taxes. It was, however, provided that the provinces might, notwithstanding, levy \"taxes, license fees and royalties upon or in respect of natural resources within the-Province.\"\nWe were advised that in some of the provinces there had been in existence for some years before 1946, taxes on income from mining operations but no similar taxation specifically on income from logging operations. The agreements, however, precluded all provincial taxation on personal or corporation income. Having regard to this legislative background, s. 5(1)(w) would appear to have been directed to permitting deduction of specific taxes, and not to have had any reference to general provincial taxes on income which did not then exist and were prohibited under the existing legislation.\nOn July 17, 1947, s. 5(1)(w) was repealed by s. 4(5) of c. 63 of the Statutes of 1947 and the following substituted:\n(w) Such amount as the Governor in Council may, by regulation, allow for amounts paid in respect of taxes imposed on the income, or any part thereof, by the Government of a Province by way of tax on income derived from mining operations or income derived from logging operations.\nThe French version of the statute is as follows:\n(w) Le montant que le gouverneur en conseil peut admettre par r\u00e8glements pour des montants vers\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des imp\u00f4ts \u00e9tablis sur le revenu ou sur une partie du revenu par le gouvernement d'une province sous forme d'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu provenant d'op\u00e9rations mini\u00e8res ou sur le revenu provenant d'op\u00e9rations foresti\u00e8res.\nThe words \"by way of tax\" and the words \"sous forme d'imp\u00f4t\", in my opinion, even more clearly preclude the view that there was in the contemplation of Parliament anything other than a provincial tax specifically imposed on income from logging or mining.\nMoreover, on the same day ass. 5(1)(w) was amended, namely, July 17, 1947, c. 58 of 11 George VI, was also enacted, by s. 3(1)(a) of which authority was given to the Minister of Finance, with the approval of the Governor-in-Council on behalf of the Government of Canada, to enter into agreements with the governments of the provinces under which the latter should refrain from levying personal income taxes, corporation income taxes, and corporation taxes as should be defined in the agreement, in respect of the period of five years commencing January 1, 1947. By s-s. (2) it was enacted that notwithstanding anything in s-s. (1), such agreements might provide that the provinces might\n(a) levy, or empower a municipality to levy income tax or corporation income tax on income earned during the whole or any part of the period mentioned in paragraph (a) of subsection one derived from mining operations or on income so earned derived from logging operations as denned in the agreement;\n(b) impose corporation income tax, in such manner as may be agreed upon, at a rate of five per centum on income of corporations earned during the whole or any part of the period mentioned in paragraph (a) of subsection one attributable to their operations in that Province \u2026\nS-s. (6) of s. 4 of c. 63 of the 1947 statutes, which amended the Income War Tax Act, had provided that s. 5(1) (w) of that Act should be applicable to income of the 1947 and subsequent taxation years.\nBy July 17, 1947, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island had already enacted enabling legislation with respect to Dominion-Provincial taxation agreements, and on August 27, 1947, Nova Scotia followed suit. Paragraph 8 of the form of agreement provided for by this provincial legislation, of which that enacted by British Columbia is an example, is as follows:\n8. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in clause six British Columbia may, during the period commencing on January 1, 1947, and ending on December 31, 1951, impose, levy and collect royalties and rentals on or in respect of natural resources within the province of British Columbia.\n(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in clause six, British Columbia or any municipality authorized by British Columbia may, during the period mentioned in paragraph one of this clause, impose, levy and collect taxes on income derived from mining operations or income derived from logging operations, or from both, carried on in the province of British Columbia during the said period, but no such tax shall be imposed by a municipality except in lieu of a tax on property or on any interest in property, other than residential property or any interest therein, of the person carrying on the said mining or logging operations.\n(3) Canada will allow as a deduction in computing income under the Income War Tax Act of the period mentioned in paragraph one of this clause, royalties and rentals, and taxes, mentioned in paragraphs one and two of this clause, respectively.\nHaving regard, therefore, to the situation revealed by this legislation, there can be no doubt in my opinion that the type of taxation to which s. 5(1)(w), as enacted in 1947, was directed, was provincial taxation specifically imposed on income from mining or logging operations, that is, for amounts paid in respect of taxes imposed on the income or any part of the income of the taxpayer \"by way of tax on income derived from mining or \u2026 logging operations\", or in the language of the French version, \"sous forme d'imp\u00f4t\" on income so derived.\nNo regulations had been passed under s. 5(1)(w) as enacted in 1946 and when the paragraph was amended in 1947, it did not accord with paragraph 8 of the agreements in that it did not provide for deduction in the case of a municipal tax. On January 30, 1948, by P.C. 331, regulations were, however, passed, the first recital stating that an amendment to s. 5(1)(w) would be proposed at the then present session of Parliament to take care of this omission. It was also recited that the proposed amendment would implement the undertaking contained in clause 8 of the agreements relative to taxes on income derived from mining or logging operations. Paragraph 3 of the regulations in so far as they apply to income from logging operations is as follows:\n3. In these regulations,\n(a) \"Income derived from logging operations\" by a person means\n(i) where logs are sold by him to any person at the time of or prior to delivery to a sawmill, pulp or paper plant or other place for processing or manufacturing logs, or delivery to a carrier for export from Canada, or delivery otherwise, the net profit or gain derived by him from\n(A) the acquisition of the timber or the right to cut the timber from which the logs were obtained, and the cutting and sale, or the cutting, transportation and sale of the logs, or\n(B) the acquisition, transportation and sale of the logs, or\n(ii) where he does not sell but processes, manufactures or exports from Canada logs owned by him, the net profit or gain reasonably deemed to have been derived by him from\n(A) the acquisition of the timber or the right to cut the timber from which the logs were obtained, and the cutting and the transportation of the logs to the sawmill, pulp or paper plant or other place for processing or manufacturing, or to the carrier for export from Canada, as the case may be, or\n(B) the acquisition of the logs and the transportation of them to such point of delivery\ncomputed in accordance with sound accounting principles with reference to the value of the logs at the time of such delivery, excluding any amount added thereto by reason of processing or manufacturing the logs. It is argued for the respondents that this paragraph supports their contention that s. 5(1)(w) contemplates the deduction of an apportioned part of a general provincial income tax in that the regulation provides for the segregation of income from logging from other income.\nEven if it would be proper to construe the statute by-reference to the regulations, I do not think that this contention is sound. Whether s. 5(1)(w) referred to a specific tax or a general tax, if a person in the pulp and paper business, for example, who carried on his own logging operations, was to be permitted to deduct the tax in respect of income from the purely logging operations, it was necessary that the regulations should provide a basis for the segregation of that income. Accordingly, the regulations with respect to both logging and mining income are completely colourless so far as this contention is concerned.\nP.C. 331 was amended on March 6, 1948, by a new paragraph one, which reads as follows:\n1. Subject to these regulations the amount that a person may deduct from income under paragraph (w) of subsection one of section five, is an amount not exceeding the proportion of the total taxes therein mentioned paid by him to\n(a) the Government of a Province, or\n(b) a municipality in lieu of taxes on property or any interest in property other than his residential property or any interest therein\nthat the part of his income that is equal to the amount of\n(c) income derived by him from mining operations as defined herein, or\n(d) income derived by him from logging operations as defined herein is of the total income in respect of which the taxes therein mentioned were so paid.\nThis provision substituted deduction of a proportion of the tax paid for the provision of paragraph one as originally passed in January, 1948, under which actual taxes paid by the taxpayer on income from mining or logging operations was deductible, although, in view of the definitions in paragraph three of the original regulations, some difficulty might well have arisen in cases where the ascertainment of the income by a province differed from the basis laid down in that paragraph. It was no doubt to obviate any such difficulty that the amendment was passed. As amended, the deduction authorized was the fraction of the provincial or municipal tax represented by the taxpayer's income from logging operations as defined by the regulations, divided by the taxpayer's total income in respect of which the taxes mentioned in s. 5(1)(w) were paid, i.e., the total income from logging as defined by the provincial legislation.\nThe enactment of the statute of 1948, and the repeal of s. 5(1)(w) as enacted in 1947, did no more, in my opinion, than remove the limitation on deduction to provincial taxes and permit the deduction of municipal taxes.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the appeals should be allowed with costs here and below.\nRand J.:\u2014The question raised by these appeals is the right of the respondent companies to a deduction from income and excess profit taxes for the year 1947 under para, (w) of s-s. 1 of s. 5 of the Income War Tax Act. The deduction is in respect of taxes paid to the governments of Ontario and Quebec on income under the Corporation Taxation Act of each province. Para, (w) as enacted in 1947 reads:\u2014\nSuch amount as the Governor in Council may, by regulation, allow for amounts paid in respect of taxes imposed on the income, or any part thereof, by the Government of a province by way of tax on income derived from mining operations or income derived from logging operations.\nAs repealed and re-enacted in 1948, it is in these words:\u2014\nSuch amount as the Governor in Council may, by regulation, allow in respect of taxes on income for the year from mining or logging operations.\nThe provincial taxes were on the income of total operations carried on by the companies which included not only logging operations but also the production of pulp and paper. The companies claim the right to allocate a portion of those taxes to the logging operations; the contention of the Crown is that para, (w) applies only to taxes which are specifically imposed in relation to income from logging operations as a separate subject matter, even though the latter may be part of a larger operation as in the cases before us.\nOn its face, the 1947 version, by the words \"by way of tax on income derived \u2026 from logging operations\" indicates a tax related by the province exclusively to the income from those particular activities. But Mr. Johnson lays down as the first component of his argument, the proposition that in interpreting (w) we should apply the rule of apportionment approved by the Judicial Committee in Commissioner of Taxation v. Kirk 2, and followed in International Harvester Co. v. Provincial Tax Commission 3 and Provincial Treasurer of Manitoba v. Wm. Wrigley Co. Ltd. 4. That rule is this: that when a tax is imposed on a segment of business whose total operations extend beyond the taxing jurisdiction, the income from the whole of the operations is to be treated as distributed over the range of processes which make up that whole. This furnishes a basis on which the taxation of the income attributable to the portion carried on, say, in a province, can be determined : it may be a distribution of the income in relation to the cost of each such process or by means of any other formula that will fairly reflect the share in the end result which it contributes.\nThe fallacy in this lies in the fact that the rule is one relating to the taxation of a constructively segregated portion of an entire business ; but there is no question of taxation here; the paragraph deals only with an allowable deduction of taxes exacted by another authority. What it is directed to is a provincial tax that is imposed upon an exclusive entirety of logging operations, or specifically on logging operations as a part of a larger entirety for which some rule of apportionment is necessary. Mr. Johnson's argument is one, in a proper case, to be addressed to the taxing authority of Ontario when such a tax is imposed as in the decisions mentioned. But there is no such provincial tax here, and there is, therefore, nothing on which the paragraph can operate. What he asks is that the plain language of the clause be complicated by the application of a rule designed for an entirely different purpose.\nThen it is said that the regulations made under the authority of the paragraph as it was enacted in 1947 must, because of its repeal by the 1948 enactment, be read with the latter, and that, so read, the companies bring themselves within the provisions of both.\nThe regulations were made by P.C. 331 on January 30, 1948. The preamble refers to the language of para, (w), \"by way of taxes on income derived, etc.\" and the deduction was to be in relation to taxes on income earned only from January 1, 1947, whatever might be the accounting period of the taxpayer ending in that year. It recites the intention to propose an amendment to para, (w) in relation to taxes \"imposed on the income or any part thereof by any municipality authorized \u2026 by way of tax on income derived from \u2026 logging operations.\" By para. (2) of the operative part, a receipt for payment of the taxes in respect of which the deduction is claimed is required. By para. (3) \"income derived from logging operations\" is defined for both the case of logs which are cut and prepared and then sold, and where they are carried into further manufacture; and a basis is laid down for computing income \"with reference to the value of the logs at the time of such delivery\", meaning, where further operations are carried on, the delivery to the sawmill, pulp or paper plant or other place where they commence.\nPara. (1) of the regulation was amended on March 6, 1948 by a re-enactment providing that the amount deductible under para, (w) shall not exceed\nthe proportion of the total taxes therein mentioned (in para, (w)) paid by him to\n(a) the government of a province \u2026 that the part of his income that is equal to the amount of\n* * *\n(d) income derived by him from logging operations as defined herein is of the total income in respect of which the taxes therein mentioned (para. (w)) were so paid.\nThe important words are \"income \u2026 from logging operations as denned herein\" that is, the basis set up in the regulations. In other words, if that basis should produce only one-half of the amount of income taxed by the province ,then only one-half of the taxes paid could be deducted under (w). The Dominion did not intend to allow deduction on the basis of larger income than that produced by the application of its own formula. What is clear is that the denominator of that fraction is a figure determined not by the Minister or any court but by the province. This, in turn, is connected with the Dominion-Provincial taxing agreements to which I shall later refer.\nBut it is argued that (w), re-enacted in 1948, is broader than that of 1947, both of which were declared to apply to the taxation year 1947; that it allows an income on logging operations to be ascertained by the Minister or court by apportioning the total income taxed by the province; and that the regulations must be interpreted in the light of that change. The latter are governed by s. 20 of the Interpretation Act; but their meaning must be gathered in the light of the provision by which they were authorized; and if so construed, they are consistent with the repealing enactment, they remain in force, if not, they are so far superseded.\nI see no difference in meaning between para, (w) of 1947 and that of 1948. The object of the latter was to extend the deduction to similar taxation by municipalities. But if the 1948 language is to be taken to permit a deduction in cases of taxation such as we have in the cases before us, the regulations would be inconsistent with it and would stand repealed, and there would then be none to authorize any deduction. Since the regulations were allowed to stand, it must be taken that the Governor in Council, at least, interpreted the 1948 amendment to the same effect as the language of 1947.\nThat the intention of Parliament is carried out by this interpretation is confirmed by s. 3(2)(a) of c. 58 of the Dominion statutes, 1947. (The Dominion-Provincial Tax Rental Agreements Act, 1947). This enactment authorized the Dominion government to enter into taxing agreements with the provinces, one effect of which was that the latter agreed not to impose personal or corporation income taxes for five years, subject to the exception, among others, that the government of a province might\n(a) levy or empower a municipality to levy income tax or corporation income tax on income earned during the whole or any part of the period mentioned in para, (a) of subsec. 1 derived from \u2026 logging operations.\nI entertain no doubt that this language means a specific tax on the income derived from such an operation, ascertained by the province or municipality and nothing else; all other income was ruled out. The purpose was to apply consistently a principle of not affecting provincial taxation of natural resources in their immediate and direct exploitation. This statute was assented to on July 17, 1947, the day of the enactment of para, (w) for that year, and that the one was intended to be consistent with the other is inescapable. The question arises here only by reason of the fact that neither Ontario nor Quebec availed itself of the tax proposals. The apparent discrimination between specific taxation of ascertained income from logging operations and that involved in total income attributable to them may seem unjust but when the language of the legislation is reasonably free from doubt, that impression becomes irrelevant. The net income of total operations does not necessarily reflect a net return from all of its constituent segments and that was appreciated here by leading evidence to show the logging operations to have been by themselves profitable. But we cannot speculate on that or any other possible element in the policy behind the limitative provision: it is sufficient that Parliament has made its intention clear.\nSince, then, in neither case is there a provincial tax on income from the logging operations segregated according to the terms of the taxing statute, the case is not within either the regulations or para, (w), and the Minister was right in his refusal to allow the deductions claimed.\nThe appeals must, therefore, be allowed and the actions dismissed with costs in both courts.\nAppeals allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: T.

APPEAL from an Order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal by the Public Trustee from an Order of Barton J. of the Surrogate Court of the County of York on passing the accounts of the Executor of the will of Joseph E. Atkinson, deceased. The total value of the assets of the estate amounted to $12,200,624.20 and the period of administration was approximately three years. The amount allowed the executor was $375,000. The Court of Appeal ordered the amount of compensation reduced to the sum of $149,124.57.

Wilson, Q.C. for the Official Guardian.\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014I agree with the reasons of my brother Kerwin.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Estey, JJ. was delivered by:-\nKERWIN J.:\u2014In passing the accounts of the appellant as executor of the estate of Joseph E. Atkinson, a Surrogate Court Judge allowed it the sum of $375,000 as \u201ca fair and reasonable allowance for (its) care, pains and trouble and (its) time expended in or about the estate\u201d pursuant to s-s. 3 of s. 60 of The Trustee Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 400. Since by the terms of Mr. Atkinson\u2019s will property was given for a charitable purpose, the Public Trustee was interested as appears from The Charities Accounting Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 50, and in accordance with s-s. 9 of s. 72 of The Surrogate Courts Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 380, notice of taking the accounts had been served upon him. The appellant had filed in the Surrogate Court a \u201cStatement of Compensation\u201d reading as follows:\u2014\nProbate Value\n12,200,624.20\n3% on..................................................................................\n12,200,624.20\n366,018.72\nRevenue Account\n5% on..................................................................................\n467,805.67\n23,390.28\n389,409.00\nFee Asked\n$ 375,000.00\nOn the date fixed for passing the accounts, the Public Trustee filed a statement of \u201cCompensation estimated by the Public Trustee on basis of completed performance by Executor of its limited duties\u201d, in which he suggested that a lump sum, not exceeding $100,000, be awarded as compensation, and gave certain figures which it was stated would be useful in arriving at such an amount. At the very outset, therefore, it was apparent that there was a dispute as to the amount of the allowance to be fixed by the judge.\nBy s-s. (1) of s. 31 of The Surrogate Courts Act:\u2014\n31. (1) Any party or person taking part in the proceedings may appeal to the Court of Appeal from any order, determination or judgment of a surrogate court or a judge thereof in any matter or cause if the value of the property affected by such order, determination or judgment exceeds $200.\nActing under this provision the Public Trustee appealed to the Court of Appeal against the amount of the allowance fixed by the Surrogate Court Judge. After a lengthy argument, the Court deemed that it and counsel would be unduly restricted in the consideration and presentation of the questions raised by the paucity of the material then available. Accordingly, in pursuance of the powers conferred upon it by s. 27 of The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 190, it directed a reference to the Senior Master at Toronto to make such inquiries as might be deemed necessary to enable the Court, on further consideration, finally to dispose of the matter. Evidence was taken on six different days before the Master and the transcription thereof and the exhibits were returned to the Court of Appeal. The matter came on for further argument and consideration whereupon the Court of Appeal determined that a fair and reasonable allowance was $149,124.57.\nThe evidence need not be detailed as it is sufficiently summarized in the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal[2]. In view of this evidence, which had not been presented to the Surrogate Court Judge, the Court of Appeal was in a much better position than he to fix the allowance. The matters to be considered in fixing such compensation have been established for some years by decisions of the Ontario Courts, including several in the Court of Appeal, and there is really no dispute as to what these matters are or that they are not proper. It was contended, however, that the Court of Appeal was not entitled to set aside the allowance made by the Surrogate Court Judge unless some error in \u201cprinciple\u201d was shown, by which could only be meant that the Surrogate Court Judge failed to apply one or more of the applicable matters. That contention is unsound. The parties admit that five per cent on the revenue account is correct but the dispute is as to the allowance to be made otherwise. If in that connection the Surrogate Court Judge proceeded upon a percentage basis, the Court of Appeal considered that basis to be an improper one, and in the circumstances of this case we agree. If, on the other hand, he merely fixed a total amount, the Court of Appeal decided that that amount was excessive, and we consider that it had not only the jurisdiction (which was not denied), but should exercise it. We think the Court of Appeal exercised that jurisdiction properly and we are unable to say that the amount fixed by it should be increased.\nThe appeal should be dismissed. Not as a precedent but under the circumstances, the order as to the costs of this appeal should be the same as the Court of Appeal made with respect to the costs of the appeal before it.\nRAND J.:\u2014The Court of Appeal, to enable itself to pronounce intelligently upon the appeal from the Surrogate Court, found it necessary to direct the taking of evidence in detail to show the work done by the Trustees, its significance, its results, and the responsibility attending it, for which the fee was allowed on the passing of the accounts at which no such enquiry had been made. The facts disclosed were subjected to a careful appraisal. Since this is a matter peculiarly within the judicial administration of the province, it would require something patently unjust, which I cannot say I find here, before I would venture to substitute my evaluation of the services rendered for that of the Court of Appeal. Standards of fees are essentially local, and those who are familiar with their application, influenced as it is by the total surroundings, are in much the best position to make that assessment. The administration of this power may, at times, tend to become mechanical, or there may be occasions when particular adjudications appear to be so; at such times the supervisory power of the Appeal Court is properly called upon to restore substance and reality to its exercise.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal. All parties will be entitled to costs out of the estate, those of the appellant to be as between solicitor and client.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014I have examined with care all of the evidence taken before the Senior Master pursuant to the Order of the Court of Appeal. It cannot be said that the Court has erred in stating the principles to be applied in determining the compensation of the executor and the amount awarded is that considered by all of the learned Judges to be fair and reasonable. I have come to the conclusion that in these circumstances the judgment from which the appeal is taken should not be disturbed and would dismiss the appeal.\nI would allow the parties to this appeal their costs out of the estate, those of the appellant as between solicitor and client.\nAppeal dismissed.

The trial judge apportioned the blame between Dalton and the operators of the plough at two-thirds and one- third respectively. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta held that the operators of the plough were solely to blame but refused to increase the amount of the damages awarded to Dalton.\nThis Court agreed unanimously with the Appellate Division that the accident was occasioned by the sole negligence of the operators of the plough.\nOn Dalton's cross-appeal for an increase in general damages,\nHeld: (Locke J. dissenting), that the cross-appeal should be allowed.\nPer: Rand, Kellock, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: While a second Court of Appeal should be extremely slow to interfere with the assessment of damages made by a judge at trial and affirmed by the first Court of Appeal, it is nonetheless its duty to do so when satisfied that the amount awarded is a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages (Nance v. B. C. Electric Ry Co. Ltd. [1951] A.C. 601).\nSuch was the award in this case. The amount was not commensurate with the injuries suffered and it would appear that the trial judge either failed to give due weight to his findings as to the gravity and permanence of the injuries or allowed his assessment to be too greatly influenced by the mere possibility of improvement.\nPer: Locke J. (dissenting in part) : Since there were concurrent findings on the question of fact as to what sum of money would be a reasonable compensation and since it has not been shown that the Courts below erred on some matter of principle in arriving at their conclusions, this Court, following its well settled practice, should not interfere with the assessment. APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division 1, in an action arising out of an automobile collision.\nJ.J. Frawley Q.C. for the appellants.\nR. L. Fenerty Q.C. for the respondents Nesting and Madsen.\nH. W. Riley Q.C. for the respondent Dalton.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock, Cartwright and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nCartwright J.:\u2014This litigation arises out of a collision between two automobiles, one driven by the respondent Dalton and the other by the respondent Madsen. The respondent Nesting was riding as a passenger in the last mentioned vehicle. Each driver asserted that the collision was caused by the negligence of the other and also by the negligence of the appellants Archibald and Talbot who were operating a snowplough.\nThe learned trial judge absolved Madsen from blame, found that Dalton and the appellants were negligent and fixed their degrees of fault at 66\u2154 per cent and 33\u2153 per cent respectively. He assessed the damages as follows:\u2014 Miss Nesting\u2014$5,504, Madsen\u2014$3,382, and Dalton\u2014$9,295. Judgment was entered accordingly. The present appellants and Dalton both appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta 2. Dalton's appeal succeeded as to the finding of negligence on his part but failed in so far as he sought an increase of damages. In this Court, the appellants ask that they be absolved from all blame and alternatively that part of the blame be attributed to Madsen and Dalton. Madsen and Nesting cross-appeal seeking to have the finding of negligence on the part of Dalton restored. Dalton cross-appeals asking an increase in the general damages awarded to him and that Madsen should be found guilty of negligence contributing to the accident.\nI find it unnecessary to set out the facts in regard to the happening of the collision, which are fully stated in the judgments below, as I am in respectful agreement with the conclusion of the Appellate Division that the appellants are solely responsible for the damages suffered. This leaves for consideration the cross-appeal of Dalton in so far as it asks that the general damages of $8,000 awarded to him should be increased. The amount claimed for general damages in Dalton's statement of claim was $25,000. The accident happened on the 30th of December, 1949 and the trial took place in the month of December 1951. At the time of the trial the appellant Dalton was thirty-five years of age. He is married and has two young children. Prior to his marriage he had been in the army and after his discharge had been employed as a salesman with the Heinz Company. At the time of his marriage he gave up the last mentioned employment and thereafter worked for the Imperial Oil Company at Leduc until November, 1949, when he set up a clothing business. The evidence as to the extent and prospects of this business is somewhat indefinite and there is no evidence as to the amount of Dalton's earnings in his prior employments. At the date of the trial he was still carrying on the clothing business but under difficulties resulting from his injuries and necessitating assistance from his wife and others which he had not previously required.\nWhile the assistance to be derived from the medical evidence would have been greater had the doctor who testified made a more recent examination, the evidence taken as a whole supports the findings of the learned trial judge as to the injuries suffered by Dalton and his resulting condition. These findings are expressed as follows:\u2014\n\u2026 There remains only one question, the amount of his general damage. There is no doubt that this man suffered quite severe physical injuries and unfortunately those injuries were sustained to the head, to the skull, and to the brain. As has been described in considerable detail here by Dr. Gardner, an eminent specialist in that field of medical practice, there is no doubt in my mind that Dalton had a great deal of pain and suffering during and immediately after the time he suffered the injuries. Possibly by far the worst injury he suffered is the resultant amnesia which clearly arose from this accident. There is no difficulty in finding that in fact that amnesia occurred, so that he has no real memory even of the impact. His retrograde amnesia, as Dr. Gordon (sic) described it, was a major one, going back as it did, not to just immediately before the impact or an hour or two before the impact, but for seven days. I am, however, aware that there appears to be some improvement. Dalton, when in the witness stand, was able to remember being in Lethbridge on the day of the accident which means that he has made a considerable measure of recovery in his retrograde amnesia, and possibly he may eventually even remember up to the accident. Dr. Gardner is not able to tell. What is perhaps more serious and is associated with it, perhaps one should say 'allied' to the retrograde amnesia, is the amnesia or defective memory from which Dalton has continued to suffer and presently suffers. One only has to see him in the witness box and listen to his testimony to realize that that is indeed a serious condition. This man certainly is unable to carry on in a normal way as his wife described it prior to this accident when he had opened up his clothing business and also when he was in the service of Imperial Oil at Leduc for some two or three years. For example, he forgets his customers, or what it was they may have ordered. He has been and is seriously handicapped from this condition and his other injuries in carrying on his present or any other business or occupation. Very naturally the doctors are cautious as to prognostication. In addition, this man's whole nature has been changed from a vigorous, alert, pleasant and kindly one to one tending the opposite direction, dull, listless and uninterested, a condition arising from head injuries of the kind suffered by him well known to medical men. The possibility is that he may subsequently recover something of this change in personality which has occurred and which cannot but excite a considerable amount of sympathy. I think the appropriate award in the circumstances for general damages to Dalton in addition to the special damage which I have already itemized would be the sum of $8,000 and accordingly I award him that sum as general damages.\nThe unanimous reasons of the Court of Appeal were delivered by Clinton Ford J.A. who deals with the question of Dalton's damages in the following words:\u2014\nDamages were assessed by the learned trial judge after careful consideration of the factors that enter into the question of the amount that should be allowed to each claimant; and, although it was urged that the sum of $8,000 allowed to Dalton was much less than the nature and extent of his injuries should warrant, I would not increase the amount awarded to him.\nThe principles by which an appellate court should be guided in deciding whether it is justified in disturbing the finding of a court of first instance as to the quantum of damages have recently been re-stated by Viscount Simon giving the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Nance v. B.C. Electric Railway Co. Ltd. 3. Their Lordships say at pages 613 and 614:\u2014\nWhether the assessment of damages be by a judge or a jury, the appellate court is not justified in substituting a figure of its own for that awarded below simply because it would have awarded a different figure if it had tried the case at first instance. Even if the tribunal of first instance was a judge sitting alone, then, before the appellate court can properly intervene, it must be satisfied either that the judge, in assessing the damages, applied a wrong principle of law- (as by taking into account some irrelevant factor or leaving out of account some relevant one) ; or, short of this, that the amount awarded is either so inordinately low or so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage (Flint v. Lovell, approved by the House of Lords in Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Ld.). The last named case further shows that when on a proper direction the quantum is ascertained by a jury, the disparity between the figure at which they have arrived and any figure at which they could properly have arrived must, to justify correction by a court of appeal, be even wider than when the figure has been assessed by a judge sitting alone. The figure must be wholly 'out of all proportion' (per Lord Wright, Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Ld.).\nWhile no doubt a second Court of Appeal should be extremely slow to interfere with the assessment of damages made by a judge at the trial when that assessment has been affirmed by the first Court of Appeal it is nonetheless its duty to do so in a proper case. An example is to be found in Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Ld. referred to above.\nAs I read the findings of fact of the learned trial judge which I have quoted they indicate that ever since the accident Dalton has, to a very substantial extent, been deprived of his ability to carry on efficiently in any business or occupation, that there has been a grave interference with his normal enjoyment of life, that his memory is seriously impaired and his personality sadly altered, and that there is a possibility, rather than a probability, of some improvement. On this state of facts in my respectful opinion the amount awarded was, to use the words of Viscount Simon, \"so inordinately low as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage.\" I am unable to say to what extent the assessment made by the learned trial judge was affected by his finding as to a possibility of improvement. The existence of such a possibility as the evidence indicates does not appear to me a sufficient reason for fixing the damages at the amount mentioned. The medical testimony was that Dalton had suffered \"considerable brain damage of important areas\". The evidence of Mrs. Dalton indicated the serious effects of these injuries persisting at the date of the trial two years after the accident. Dr. Gardner's evidence shows that in his opinion there was a possibility of limited improvement not of complete recovery. It is true that it is possible that the future will prove better than the evidence appears to indicate but the contrary is also possible and the innocent person who has been gravely injured by the fault of another should not be called upon to bear all the risk of the uncertainties of the future.\nI am driven to the conclusion that the learned trial judge either failed to give due weight to his findings as to the gravity of the injuries suffered or allowed his assessment to be too greatly influenced by the mere posibility of improvement; and with the greatest respect I am of opinion that the amount awarded can not be allowed to stand. Accepting, as I do, the findings of the learned trial judge as to the nature and extent of Dalton's injuries I am of opinion that the lowest amount at which his general damages can be fixed which is commensurate with the injuries suffered is $15,000, and I would substitute that figure for the $8,000 assessed at the trial.\nIn the result I would dismiss the appeal and would allow Dalton's cross-appeal to the extent of directing that he recover from Archibald and Talbot $16,295. The order of the Appellate Division as to the payment of costs in the courts below should stand. The respondents Madsen, Nesting and Dalton should recover their costs of the appeal to this Court from the appellants. The respondent Dalton should recover the costs of his cross-appeal to this Court from the appellants. The cross-appeal of Dalton as against Madsen and that of Madsen and Nesting as against Dalton should be dismissed without costs.\nLocke J. (dissenting in part) :\u2014The able argument addressed to us in this matter by Mr. Frawley on behalf of the appellants has not satisfied me that the finding of the Appellate Division 4 that the accident was occasioned by the negligence of the appellants is not supported by the evidence and, accordingly, in my opinion, the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nThe respondent Dalton, whose general damages were fixed at the sum of $8,000, by the learned trial Judge, has cross-appealed, asking that this amount be increased. On the appeal to the Appellate Division by the present appellants, a cross-appeal by Dalton in respect of the general damages allowed him was dismissed by the unanimous judgment of the Court.\nThe evidence as to the prospects of Dalton recovering from the effect of the injuries sustained by him is unfortunately both incomplete and unsatisfactory. The accident occurred on December 30, 1949, and immediately following it he was removed to a hospital at MacLeod, Alberta, where he was under the care of a Doctor Gordon until January 9, when he was removed to the Colonel Belcher Hospital in Calgary. The injuries he had sustained, other than those to his head, were minor in character. Dr. Gordon did not give evidence at the trial nor any one from the MacLeod Hospital, the only medical evidence as to the nature of the injuries being that given by Dr. J. S. Gardner, a surgeon practising in Calgary, who was one of several doctors who examined Dalton between the time of his entry into the hospital and January 21, 1950, when he was discharged.\nDr. Gardner saw Dalton on his admission to the Colonel Belcher Hospital and said that he was then pale and lethargic and did not seem to know just where he was. According to the doctor:\u2014\nHe was put to bed and examined by one of our people who are interested in neurological diseases and his conclusion was that he had suffered a very severe head injury ten days previously and was still suffering considerable effects.\nContinuing he said that on investigation it had been found that he had suffered a considerable fracture of the left vault of his skull which ran down into the interior phase of the skull and showed evidence of having suffered cerebral concussion:\u2014\nof a fairly major degree and some cerebral contusions and probably laceration in as much as the spinal fluid was straw-coloured and contained a large excess of protein.\nHe also said that Dalton was suffering from amnesia. Asked as to whether these conclusions were his own as a result of personal examination or as the result of an examination by somebody who was interested in neurological matters, Dr. Gardner said that various members of the staff had seen Dalton and that it was the general consensus of opinion that he had suffered a brain tissue injury. X-rays had been taken in the Calgary Hospital which disclosed the fracture. The witness said further that:\u2014\nWe felt he had suffered a considerable brain damage of important areas by his reactions and his slowness in recovery.\nAsked to describe what were the usual effects of that type of head injury, he said that the most prominent symptoms that might go on for years were headache and dizziness or vertigo, which was sometimes very persistent after head injuries, and that sometimes there was buzzing in the ears or \"high ear whistling.\" Continuing he said:\u2014\nThen there is a whole group of what we call post-concussional sequilea that have to do with changes in part in intellect but mainly emotional reaction. Some people following a head injury of this nature, appear to be different people. They have a different emotional pattern that makes them like different people. There are all manner of things like tender areas or swollen areas or nerve injuries and all those things.\nIt was on January 21, 1950, that Dalton left the Calgary Hospital and while Dr. Gardner said that he was under the impression that Mrs. Dalton had brought her husband back to see him some weeks after that, he had no record of the interview. He thought, however, that Dalton had then a poor memory and could not keep his mind on a subject for long and was afraid to return to his business. Dr. Gardner did not see Dalton again until the day the trial commenced at Calgary December 5, 1951.\nCross-examined, Dr. Gardner said that Dalton suffered from what was called \"retrograde amnesia\", which he explained as a loss of memory of events occurring prior to the accident and said that, as to this, the strange thing was that memory would return up to a point. A further passage in his cross-examination reads:\u2014\nQ. As far as being of any assistance to his recovery, on the degree of recovery of paralysis (sic) you cannot assist him at all, can you? You had not seen him for so long?\u2014A. Not at the present time.\nQ. He could be perfectly all right at the present time?\u2014A. Yes, indeed, he could.\nAfter the cross-examination by counsel, the trial Judge questioned Dr. Gardner at some length, in an endeavour to clarify his evidence. The doctor said that in Dalton's case there was a retrograde amnesia of about a week and that this was \"a fairly large retrograde amnesia.\" The transcript of this examination reads in part as follows:\u2014\nQ. In the light of that, and the fact that you saw this patient at least once a day and perhaps several times a day during the period from the 9th of January until the 21st of January, 1950, are you able to say or would you feel you could make any estimate as to his memory defects and whether there will be any further recovery to any real degree or whether it has now reached its maximum and is stationary?\u2014A. Well, in part, I can say something.\nQ. Yes?\u2014A. I would not like to say anything about his present memory defect without examination.\nQ. Quite.\u2014A. The man, as I recall seeing him subsequent to his injury, that was the main system (sic), that he could not keep his eye on the ball, as it were, and he could not remember. That is the only knowledge I have of his subsequent memory defect. But I would say in my opinion that it is not likely with that severity of injury and that severity of amnesia at his age that he would get any appreciable improvement in his memory now except by intensive training which might or might not play a part. After the completion of this examination, counsel for Madsen asked Dr. Gardner if he was aware that Dalton at that time was able to remember to within three hours before the accident and he said that he was not.\nThe medical evidence was left in this state. The failure to call Dr. Gordon who had attended Dalton at the hospital in MacLeod may have been due to his not having examined Dalton since January 9, 1950. However, according to Dalton, he had gone to \"quite a few doctors\": their identity, however, was not disclosed nor any explanation given as to why none of them were called. I must assume that the course followed on his behalf was deliberate and that he was advised to rely upon the evidence of a doctor who had not seen him for at least twenty months prior to the trial. It was not apparently suggested to the learned trial Judge that he might then direct a medical examination of Dalton to obtain an opinion as to the prospect of his recovery, under the powers vested in him by Rule 260 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Alberta. Whether the parties contrary in interest to Dalton had obtained an order for his medical examination prior to the trial under Rule 259 and had him examined is not shown. Neither the present appellants nor the respondents Nesting and Madsen called any medical evidence as to his condition.\nDalton was the owner of a men's clothing store in Leduc, selling amongst other things custom made clothes, the sale of which required him to take measurements of his customers. He had gone back to work in March 1950 following the accident but found that he could not do this particular work without assistance. He had commenced the operation of the store at the end of 1948. According to Dalton, his principal difficulty was his inability to remember people and, on occasions where he had measured people for clothes, he had forgotten both the fact of taking the order and the person who had given it. It was in consequence of this, apparently, that he had got assistance for this work from an older man who was familiar with it. When asked if he suffered from headaches, he said that he did not and he did not complain of dizziness or vertigo. Mrs. Dalton gave evidence as to her husband's difficulties occasioned by his inability to remember orders he had taken and said that before the accident he had been a good salesman. Speaking of his disposition, she said he had been very friendly with people and had a pleasant personality but that now he found it difficult to carry on in this way. She said also that her husband, contrary to what he had said in evidence, complained of severe headaches at times. His disposition which was formerly cheerful and optimistic had changed, according to her, and he was now very nervous and both very despondent and inclined to worry over trifles. While Dalton's counterclaim had claimed a loss of $1,500 for wages paid to others and earnings lost, Mrs. Dalton who alone was asked about the matter said that she could not say what amount had been lost, owing to her husband's absence from the business but that they had a bookkeeper who kept track of these things. The bookkeeper was not called. As to wages paid to others, it appeared that at the time of the accident two young Mormon missionaries occupied a room in the Dalton's house for which they paid $25 a month. During her husband's absence from the store, Mrs. Dalton said that these two missionaries ran the store and, after his return from Calgary, they continued to help being engaged for a period altogether of two months. The missionaries did not accept any payment for their services other than their board and lodging and some clothing. The evidence as to the extent of Dalton's expenditure in this respect appears to me unsatisfactory.\nIt was upon this evidence that the learned trial Judge was faced with the difficult task of assessing the damages sustained by Dalton. The items for special damage, other than the amount expended in connection with the services of the misisonaries, were apparently not disputed: as to these he allowed a sum of $600. In the absence of any evidence on the point, nothing was allowed for loss to the business. Dealing with general damages, he said that the worst injury was the resultant amnesia which, he considered, clearly arose from the accident. Speaking of the \"retrograde amnesia\", he said that it was a major one going back, according to Dr. Gardner, to seven days before the accident, but noted that there appeared to be some improvement as to this and that Dalton was able on the witness stand \"to remember being in Lethbridge on the day of the accident, which meant that he had made a considerable measure of recovery of his retrograde amnesia and that possibly he might eventually even remember up to the accident.\" Speaking as to the loss of memory following the accident, the learned trial Judge said that:\u2014\nOne only has to see him in the witness box and listen to his testimony to realize that that is indeed a serious condition. This man certainly is unable to carry on in a normal way as his wife described it prior to this accident when he had opened up his clothing business and also when he was in the service of Imperial Oil at Leduc for some two or three years. For example, he forgets his customers, or what it was they may have ordered. He has been and is seriously handicapped from this condition and his other injuries in carrying on his present or any other business or occupation. Very naturally the doctors are cautious as to prognostication. In addition, this man's whole nature has been changed from a vigorous, alert, pleasant and kindly one, to one tending in the opposite direction, dull, listless and uninterested, a condition arising from head injuries of the kind suffered by him well known to medical men. The possibility is that he may subsequently recover something of this change in personality which has occurred and which cannot but excite a considerable amount of sympathy.\nThis summary of the result of the head injuries is not unfavourable to Dalton. There was no medical evidence as to the prospect of a further recovery in Dalton's memory, other than what has been quoted from the answers made by Dr. Gardner in answer to the questions directed to him by the learned trial Judge, a statement made after he had already said that he would not like to say anything about the matter without examination. There was no evidence of any loss of trade in Dalton's store during the time between the date when he returned to work in March, 1950, and the trial, some twenty months later, so that presumably, other than his inability to measure customers for clothing, his condition did not affect his ability to manage the business.\nIn delivering the unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division dismissing Dalton's cross-appeal in respect of the general damages awarded him, Clinton J. Ford, J.A. said:\u2014\nDamages were assessed by the learned trial judge after careful consideration of the factors that enter into the question of the amount that should be allowed to each claimant; and, although it was urged that the sum of $8,000 allowed to Dalton was much less than the nature and extent of his injuries should warrant, I would not increase the amount awarded him.\nWe have thus concurrent findings on the question of fact as to what sum of money would be reasonable compensation to Dalton for the injuries he had sustained. In Dairies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ld. 5, Lord Wright said in part (p. 616):\u2014\nAn appellate court is always reluctant to interfere with a finding of the trial judge on any question of fact, but it is particularly reluctant to interfere with a finding on damages which differs from an ordinary finding of fact in that it is generally much more a matter of speculation and estimate. No doubt, this statement is truer in respect of some cases than of others. The damages in some cases may be objective and depend on definite facts and established rules of law, as, for instance, in general damages for breach of contract for the sale of goods. In these cases the finding as to amount of damages differs little from any other finding of fact, and can equally be reviewed if there is error in law or in fact. At the other end of the scale would come damages for pain and suffering or wrongs such as slander. These latter cases are almost entirely matter of impression and of common sense, and are only subject to review in very special cases. There is an obvious difference between cases tried with a jury and cases tried by a judge alone. Where the verdict is that of a jury, it will only be set aside if the appellate court is satisfied that the verdict on damages is such that it is out of all proportion to the circumstances of the case: Mechanical and General Inventions Co. Ltd. v. Austin (1935) A.C. 346. Where, however, the award is that of the judge alone, the appeal is by way of rehearing on damages as on all other issues, but as there is generally so much room for individual choice so that the assessment of damages is more like an exercise of discretion than an ordinary act of decision, the appellate court is particularly slow to reverse the trial judge on a question of the amount of damages. It is difficult to lay down any precise rule which will cover all cases, but a good general guide is given by Greer L.J. in Flint v. Lovell (1935) 1 K.B. 354, 360. In effect the court, before it interferes with an award of damages, should be satisfied that the judge has acted on a wrong principle of law, or has misapprehended the facts, or has for these or other reasons made a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage suffered. It is not enough that there is a balance of opinion or preference. The scale must go down heavily against the figure attacked if the appellate court is to interfere, whether on the ground of excess or insufficiency.\nFlint v. Lovell 6 was a decision of the Court of Appeal in an action for damages for personal injuries which had been tried before Acton J. without a jury and the remarks of Greer L.J., referred to by Lord Wright, stated the principle which, he considered, should be applied by that Court in dealing with an appeal as to the quantum of damages. In Owen v. Sykes 7, an appeal to the Court of Appeal from the judgment of a single judge in an action of the same nature, the statement of Greer L.J. in Flint's case was adopted. In Rook v. Farrie 8, a libel action tried by a single judge, where there was a cross-appeal by the plaintiff on the ground that the damages awarded were inadequate, Sir Wilfrid Green, M.R., with whom MacKinnon and du Parcq L.JJ. agreed, said that the principle stated by Greer L.J. in Flint v. Lovell was applicable to actions for damages for libel, while pointing out that in such an action the very nature of the damages which are awarded made the task of establishing error a great deal more difficult than it might be in other types of actions. The learned Master of the Rolls said in part (p. 518) :\u2014\nI agree, as I have said, that this is a case where a jury might well have awarded a very much larger sum, and in fact it is not improper to say that if I had been awarding damages here I should have awarded a larger sum. But that circumstance does not entitle me to interfere with the learned judge's judgment, whose opinion upon the appropriate figure is entitled to as much weight as mine. It is a case of different minds taking different views, and sitting in this Court I am not entitled to substitute my view for his.\nThe statement from Flint v. Lovell, referred to by Lord Wright in Davies' case, was adopted in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Nance v. British Columbia Electric Railway 9. In that case, the Court of Appeal of British Columbia had reduced the award of damages made by the jury and the remarks of Viscount Simon in the passage referred to were directed to the principles which should govern the Court of Appeal in such circumstances.\nThe principle to be followed by Provincial courts of appeal in dealing with questions of this nature has been dealt with in this Court in Levi v. Reed 10, Gingras v. Desilets 11, Cossette v. Dun 12, Montreal Gas Co. v. St. Laurent 13, and in Marsden v. Pollock 14, and does not differ from that stated in the cases decided in England. In Montreal Gas Co. v. St. Laurent, Taschereau J., delivering the judgment of the Court, said (p. 180) :\u2014\nAs to the amount of damages given by the judgment, we cannot interfere. Cossette v. Dun; Ball v. Ray, 30 L.T.N.S. 1; L\u00e9vi v. Reed. It certainly appears to be large, but, as the Court of Appeal says, there is evidence to support it, leaving out of consideration the evidence given as to problematic or uncertain future damages.\nIn the case of Ball v. Ray 15, to which Taschereau J. referred, Selborne L.C. said in part:\u2014\nIt is not shown that the Master of the Rolls in deciding upon the quantum of damages has applied to the measure of those damages any wrong principle. It is not shown that the actual amount of damages were or could be demonstrated to the court \u2026 In that state of things it was surely in an eminent degree for the court to discharge the office of a jury; and it would be easy to refer to authorities such as Penn v. Bibby (15 L.T.N.S. 399) before Chelmsford L.C. and Grey v. Turnbull in the House of Lords, and to numerous cases before the Privy Council, which show that where upon questions of fact the court appears to have fairly discharged the same duty which a jury would have to discharge upon conflicting or doubtful evidence, it will be a very difficult thing to induce the Court of Appeal to go into the merits for the purpose of forming that judgment upon the balance of the evidence which possibly might have been formed if it had come before them in the first instance. If that rule has been established and held a satisfactory one as to questions of fact in general which stand in the position which I have described, it appears to me to be of still greater importance to establish and maintain a similar rule as to mere questions of the quantum of damages. In all cases in which you deal with the verdict of a jury, or of a judge in this court, or at common law, giving a verdict properly so called without a jury under the statute which enables that to be done, the verdict is conclusive, unless a principle can be shown in respect of which there is miscarriage, and as to which it ought by a proper proceeding to be disturbed. I think the analogy of that ought to be applied in this court to all these questions of damages, and that if the judge has settled the amount of damages and it cannot be shown that there are grounds for interfering with his judgment, which would be applicable to the verdict either of a jury, or of a judge, properly so called, the Court of Appeal ought not to disturb it.\nIn the present case the finding of the learned trial Judge has been upheld by the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal and I have been unable to find that in any reported case where the finding of the trial judge as to the quantum of damage has been upheld in the Court of Appeal this Court has either varied the amount or directed a new trial upon the question. In Pratt v. Beaman 16, where the damages allowed by the trial judge for pain and suffering had been reduced in the Court of Appeal, Anglin C.J., delivering the judgment of a Court of which the other members were Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret and Smith JJ. said (p. 287):\u2014\nWhile, if we were the first appellate court, we might have been disposed not to interfere with the assessment of these damages by the Superior Court, it is the well \u2022established practice of this court not to interfere with an amount allowed for damages, such as these, by the court of last resort in a province. That court is, as a general rule, in a much better position than we can be to determine a proper allowance having regard to local environment. It is, of course, impossible to say that the Court of King's Bench erred in principle in reducing these damages.\nAs pointed out by Lord Wright in Davies' case, the finding as to the amount of damages differs little from any other finding of fact and where, as in the present case, there are concurrent findings, I am of the opinion that the rule stated by Duff J. (as he then was) in delivering the judgment of the Court in Rogers v. Davis 17, should be applied unless, indeed, it can be shown that the trial judge and the Court of Appeal have erred on some matter of principle in arriving at their conclusions. In Marsden v. Pollock, above referred to, where damages had been awarded under the Fatal Accidents Act, it was my opinion that the finding as to the quantum could not be sustained for the reason that neither the financial circumstances or the ages of the parents, on whose behalf a claim was made, had been proven and I would have directed a new hearing restricted to the assessment. Here the learned trial judge and the learned judges of the Court of Appeal are in agreement as to what amount would be a fair and reasonable compensation to Dalton for the damage sustained by him by reason of this accident, and to interfere would, in my opinion, be contrary to the well settled practice of this Court.\nI would dismiss the cross-appeal with costs, if demanded.\nAppeal dismissed with costs; cross-appeal of respondent Dalton allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: L. A. Justason.\nSolicitors for the respondents Nesting and Madsen: Fenerty, Fenerty, McGillivray & Robertson.\nSolicitors for the respondent Dalton: Macleod, Riley, McDermid, Bessemer & Dixon.\n1 [1952] 5 W.W.R.

Ltd. was incorporated under the Nova Scotia Companies Act with an authorized capital of 6,400 preference shares, par value $100, and 2,285 common shares, n.p.v. Of the preferred shares issued the Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. held 3,500 and others 2,883. Of the common issued the C.P.R. held 1,600 and others 685. All shares issued were fully paid up. The hotel property was subject to a 1st mortgage to secure $600,000, 6i per cent sinking fund bonds maturing Nov. 1, 1947. In 1932 the interest rate was reduced to 4 per cent upon the C.P.R. undertaking to guarantee the interest at the new rate until the maturity of the bonds. In consideration thereof a 2nd mortgage was given the C.P.R. on which at the time this action was brought there was outstanding $241,500. At the 1946 shareholders' annual meeting the question of providing for payment or refinancing of the maturing bonds was referred to the directors. The latter authorized C. B. Smith, the president, to discuss the matter with the C.P.R. which took the position that upon the expiration of its guarantee it would take no further part in financing the hotel. Subsequently, at the suggestion of Smith, it transferred all its shares to him for himself and his fellow directors, he undertaking to return the stock if his plan for re-financing failed. The directors, other than one Graham, then purchased on their own behalf $115,000 of the hotel bonds and the stock was divided among them. Subsequently as a result of negotiations with the C.P.R. the directors purchased the 2nd mortgage for $120,000. Held: 1. That the action was properly brought within the principle of Mener v. Hooper L.R. 9 Ch. 350.\nThat the respondent directors both in their acquisition of the shares and the 2nd mortgage became trustees for the hotel company and, except as to 200 preferred shares disposed of to one Guptill, liable as such to account therefor. Regal (Hastings) Ltd. v. Gulliver [1942] 1 All E.R. 379; Pearson's case 5 Ch. D. 336 at 341 followed.\nThat the said shares, other than those held by Guptill, be surrendered to the hotel company, the share certificates to be delivered up for cancellation. Rowell v. John Rowell & Sons Ltd. [19121 2 Ch. 609, applied.\nThat the 2nd mortgage be declared to be security for the sum of $120,000 only, with interest at 5 per cent per annum, the said respondents to be accountable for any additional amount received or which may be received by them.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1], affirming subject to variation, the judgment of the trial judge, Ilsley C.J.[2].\nJohn Jennings, Q.C. and A. G. Cooper for the appellants.\nA. S. Patillo, Q.C. and A. J. Macintosh for the respondents.\nRAND J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons and conclusions of my brother Kellock, and have only a few words to add.\nShares in a company exist by the fact of incorporation with a capital structure; they are simply fractions of potential interest in the assets and active life of the company, whatever it may be, into which the capital is divided. Their issue gives rise to a title to property which is of the nature of a chose in action. Such a title is always susceptible of release. But a company cannot purchase its own shares both because of the underlying obligation to use the funds of the company for the objects for which the company was created, of which the purchase of its own shares is not one; and because it would mean an abstraction of assets of the Company on the strength of which creditors deal with it.\nBut where shares are fully paid up and are released by way of voluntary surrender, none of these considerations applies. The assets are not affected and the balance sheet position in relation to the payment of dividends would be a matter of accounting accommodation. This latter feature is, in fact, present whenever a share is forfeited and its effect cannot be taken to be converted into an ultra vires character according to the number of paid up shares surrendered.\nThe remaining question is that of the mechanics of surrender. The case must be treated as if the Canadian Pacific Company had itself made a surrender with the intention of extinguishing its title; and the authorities cited show that such a delivery over and cancellation of the certificate effects that result, leaving the shares available for re-issue. This is the practical means for a practical situation with which the principles of company law and the provisions of the Nova Scotia Companies Act are entirely consistent.\nThe judgment of Kellock and Fauteux, JJ, was delivered by: \u2014\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014I agree with the courts below that this action was properly brought by the appellant within the principle of Menier v. Hooper's Telegraph Works[3], approved by the Judicial Committee in Burland v. Earle[4].\nSo far as the shares acquired from the Canadian Pacific Railway are concerned, the only question which need be considered is as to the remedy to which the appellant is entitled, as in my view, in the circumstances of this case, it cannot be successfully maintained that the individual respondents acquired the shares formerly held by the Canadian Pacific Railway, otherwise than under a liability to account for them to the respondent company.\nThe law is clearly laid down by Viscount Sankey in Regal (Hastings) v. Gulliver[5], as follows:\u2014\nThe respondents were in a fiduciary position and their liability to account does not depend upon proof of mala fides. The general rule of equity is that no one who has duties of a fiduciary nature to perform is allowed to enter into engagements in which he has or can have a personal interest conflicting with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect. If he holds any property so acquired as trustee, he is bound to account for it to his cestui que trust.\nWith respect, the learned trial judge and the full court have failed to appreciate the effect of the above, holding as they do, that the respondents are not liable to account for the property itself, i.e., the shares, but only for any profit which they have made or may make out of the shares. Such a view is quite erroneous. In Pearson's case[6], the Master of the Rolls, Sir George Jessel, had held with respect to a person in the position of the individual respondents, that he is liable\nat the option of the cestuis (sic) que trust, to account either far the value at the time of the present he was receiving, or to account for the thing itself and its proceeds if it had increased in the value.\nIn that case, the learned Master of the Rolls was also dealing with the shares of the actual company there concerned. Mellish L.J., also, in McKay's case[7], had stated the principle in similar terms as did Lord Esher M.R., in Eden v. Ridsdales[8].\nHad the property which the respondents received been of a nature other than shares of the respondent company there would have been no difficulty in directing the individual respondents to transfer such property to the \u2022company, or at the option of the company, to pay to the company its value. In none of the cases above referred to did any question other than the value of the shares arise.\nIt is quite plain that there would be no difficulty in directing that the respondents transfer the shares here in question to a trustee for the company. In Cree v. Somervail[9], Lord Hatherley at p. 661 and Lord Blackburn at 66, were of that opinion. The point was the subject of express decision by Romer J., as he then was, in Kirby v. Wilkins[10]. The learned trial judge in the case at bar considered the judgment of Romer J. of doubtful authority but, with respect, I am of \u2022opinion the case, so far as is here relevant, was well decided in accordance with principle and authority.\nIn Black v. Carson[11],[12], a company had acquired certain assets in consideration of the issue of the whole of its shares. The vendors, subscribers to a syndicate, had agreed among themselves that part of the shares, after their receipt by them, should be transferred to the directors of the company \"for the purpose of providing funds for the organizing of the said company, and for working capital, as the said directors may deem prudent from time to time\" (article 7). The shares were accordingly transferred to the president and secretary of the company, their successors and assigns. An action brought by or on behalf of the original subscribers for a declaration that the shares undisposed of were held in their interest and not in the interest of the company, failed. Their Lordships, agreeing with the view taken in the court below, held that the company was not subject to any trust in favour of the appellants and that there was no limitation placed upon the beneficial interest which was transferred. The Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) had adopted the reasons for judgment of Demers J. at trial who had held that the plaintiffs had \"transferred the property in the said disputed shares, absolutely to the company\". In the view of the Court of King's Bench the agreement did not\nconstitute the company the owner of its own shares, but simply postpones their sale or disposition to a later date, under such sale conditions as it may deem advisable and in the interest of the company ... Clause 7 ... has no other effect in our view than that of a by-law of the directors and the shareholders regulating in the interests of the company the distribution of the shares in question.\nIn the case at bar, while I do not think the court should direct cancellation of the shares here in question, as the appellant asks, I am of opinion that, in the circumstances which obtain, unless there be valid ground of objection in law, the court ought to direct that they be surrendered to the company rather than that they should be left to be held in trust for the company.\nIn considering the question of the propriety in law of such an order, it is not without relevance to observe that even if held in trust for the company, any profits available for dividend can only enure to the benefit of the shareholders without regard to the shares held in trust. The same would be true in any distribution of the assets of the company on a winding-up. Any objection to an order directing the surrender of the shares to the company itself must therefore be purely technical, resting upon some supposed incapacity on the part of the company. For reasons which follow I am of opinion there is no such incapacity in the case of the company with which we are here concerned.\nIn Trevor v. Whitworth[13], in which it was held that a company may not purchase its own shares, Lord Herschell, after differentiating purchase from forfeiture, for which the statute there in question provided, as does the Nova Scotia Companies Act, went on to speak of surrender, at p. 418, as follows :\nSurrender no doubt stands on a different footing. But it also does not involve any payment out of the funds of the company. If the surrender were made in consideration of any such payment it would be neither more nor less than a sale, and open to the same objections. If it were accepted in a case when the company were in a position to forfeit the shares, the transaction would seem to me perfectly valid. There may be other cases in which a surrender would be legitimate. As to these I would repeat what was said by the late Master of the Rolls in In re Dronfield & Co.[14]. \"It is not for me to say what the limits of surrender are which are allowable under the Act, because each case as it arises must be decided upon its own merits\".\nSimilarly, Lord Watson at p. 424 said:\nWhen a share is forfeited or surrendered, the amount which has been paid upon it remains with the company, the shareholder being relieved of liability for future calls, while the share itself reverts to the company, bears no dividend, and may be re-issued.\nAt a later point in his judgment, Lord Watson said at p. 429:\nThere is no reference in the Acts to surrenders of shares; but these have been admitted by the Courts upon the principle, as I understand it, that they have practically the same effect as forfeiture, the main difference being that the one is a proceeding in invitum, and the other a proceeding taken with the assent of the shareholder, who is unable to retain and pay future calls on his shares.\nIn Rowell v. John Rowell & Sons Limited[15], Warrington J., as he then was, had to consider the situation with respect to certain 6 per cent fully paid preference shares which had been surrendered, following upon which the company had issued other 5 per cent preference shares. The surrendered shares had not been cancelled but were held by the company, subject to re-issue. At p. 614 the learned judge said:\nNow the case with which I have to deal is the surrender of shares fully paid up and therefore not involving the release of the shareholder from any liability.\nAt p. 620, he said:\nthat while a surrender of fully-paid shares means, of course, a reduction of capital if the shares are surrendered upon terms which do not permit their re-issue, in the present case the shares are surrendered upon terms which do permit their re-issue, and, with all respect, I really fail to see how in that case there is any reduction of capital at all ... The shares are there ready to be issued, still forming part of the capital, and it would not require any resolution of the company to increase its capital in order to enable them to re-issue those shares. It seems to me, therefore, that, if the re-issue of these shares would not require any resolution for an increase of capital, there was in fact no reduction of capital in accepting the surrender coupled with the power of re-issuing these shares.\nThe above decision was referred to in this court with approval in Alberta Rolling Mills Co. v. Christie[16].\nIt is quite true that in Rowell's case the articles of association empowered the directors to accept surrenders on such terms as they saw fit. Articles of association, however, are merely internal regulations of the company, and cannot empower a company to do anything to which the memorandum of association does not extend.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the proper order to make is that the shares formerly held by the railway, except 200 preferred shares now held by Guptill, be surrendered by the individual respondents to respondent company, the share certificates to be delivered up for cancellation. It appears that certain of these shares are held in the name of Stan-bury and Company Limited as trustees for Oland and Stan-bury or either of them. Stanbury Si Company Limited should, therefore, be added as a party and if it desires to raise any issue as to the shares so held by it, such issue shall be referred to the trial court to be dealt with according to the rules of that court. In default the said added party shall be bound by this judgment. With respect to the Guptill shares, the evidence indicates that these were applied by Smith in the interests of the respondent company in bringing about the reorganization and therefore do not form any part of the profit acquired by the other directors in breach of their fiduciary obligation.\nIt should be added, as to Stanbury, that he became a director on June 19, 1947, and his proportion of the railway company shares was transferred to him on July 15. It is, however, immaterial that he was not a director at the time Smith arranged originally for the shares to be given him. He nevertheless received the shares knowing the circumstances and is in no better position than the other directors who participated. Cookson v. Lee[17].\nIn considering the question as to the second mortgage, it is necessary to review the relevant circumstances. At a meeting of directors of May 31, 1946, the question of providing for the retirement or refunding of the company's bonded indebtedness, which had been referred to the directors by the shareholders, was discussed. The directors were unanimously of opinion that before formulating any plan the matter should be discussed with the Railway Company \"as the party most directly interested both as being the largest shareholder and also being the second mortgagee\". Accordingly, the respondent Smith was directed to take up the matter with the railway \"with a view to ascertaining the wishes of that company in the premises\".\nAt this time the respondent company had outstanding $600,000 4 per cent first mortgage bonds, maturing November 1, 1947, the interest being guaranteed by the railway company to that date but not thereafter. The railway company was also the holder of the second mortgage on which $241,500 principal was outstanding. The interest on the bonds and the second mortgage was then in current shape.\nIn the course of the negotiations with the railway company conducted by Smith, the latter says that it was made very clear to him that\nwith the expiration of their guarantee of interest on the First Mortgage bonds, Canadian Pacific had no further interest in the Lord Nelson.\nThey were \"not interested in protecting their investment, most of which had been written off\". Their \"investment\" included the shares and the mortgage.\nUltimately, the bondholders exchanged the existing bonds for new bonds maturing November 1, 1967, and the railway company on its part agreed to reduce the rate of interest on its second mortgage to 3 per cent, payable only if earned, and that, so long as any of the bonds should be outstanding, the mortgage should not be enforceable. These arrangements were concluded in or about October 1947.\nDuring the period that the guarantee of the railway company of the interest on the original First Mortgage bonds had been in operation the respondent company had experienced considerable difficulty in financing. At the end of December 1940, the amount outstanding for principal on the second mortgage had risen to $266,500 principal with $100,901.85 arrears of interest, a total of $367,401.85. Subsequently, however, the business of the hotel improved so that by the end of 1943 the arrears of interest had been paid and in July 1944, $25,000 was paid on account of principal.\nWithin a few months of the conclusion of the arrangements in October 1947, namely in April 1948, the provincial legislature enacted liquor control legislation following upon an earlier plebiscite. From the resulting situation it would undoubtedly be expected that the hotel would benefit.\nIn a letter written by the respondent Smith on January 10, 1951, the latter stated that\nsince the reorganization, the company, through its directors ... have all along been of the opinion that it would be in the best interest of the shareholders to effect a sale if a favourable opportunity presented itself.\nTo this end they have, over the past three years, endeavoured to interest various persons or organizations in the purchase of assets and undertaking of the company\u2026\nThese efforts culminated in December 1950 in the receipt of an offer to purchase from a well known company operating a large chain of hotels.\nIn the meantime, in September 1949, Smith and a number of the other respondents had entered into negotiations with the Canadian Pacific Railway for an assignment to them personally of that company's second mortgage and this was duly carried out in November 1949, the railway company assigning the mortgage to Oland and Stanbury as trustees for themselves, Clarke, Smith and a company called Delta Securities Limited, in which J. H. Wingate, formerly a director of the respondent company, was interested as a shareholder, he having previously resigned in 1948. The consideration for the assignment of the mortgage was $120,000. It is in these circumstances the appellant claims that the interested respondents are entitled to claim against the hotel company only the amount actually paid by them for the assignment with interest on that sum from its date.\nIn my view the position of these respondents with respect to the mortgage is governed by the principle already cited from the judgment of Viscount Sankey in the Regal case at p. 381. Lower down on the same page, Viscount Sankey referred to the headnote to the decision of the House of Lords in Hamilton v. Wright[18], as follows:\nA trustee is bound not to do anything which can place him in a position inconsistent with the interests of his trust, or which can have a tendency to interfere with his duty in discharging it. Neither the trustee nor his representative can be allowed to retain an advantage acquired in violation of this rule.\nHis Lordship also cited the following passage from the judgment of Lord Brougham in that case, at p. 124:\nthe knowledge which he acquires as trustee is of itself sufficient ground of disqualification, and of requiring that such knowledge shall not be capable of being used for his own benefit to injure the trust. The ground of the disqualification is not merely because such knowledge may enable him actually to obtain an undue advantage over others.\nIn the case cited, a trustee had acquired by assignment a bond of annuity which had been granted by his cestui que trust. It was held by the Lord Ordinary that the trustee could not sue upon the bond but was bound to give to the cestui que trust \"any advantage that may have accrued or may yet accrue\", from the transaction. This decision was reversed on appeal but was restored in the House of Lords. At p. 124, Lord Brougham said:\u2014\nIn Ex Parte Lacey[19], Lord Eldon denied the doctrine supposed to have been delivered by Lord Loughborough in Whichcote v. Lawrence[20], that a trustee must make some advantage of his purchase before it can be set aside; because in ninety-nine cases out of every hundred, he held that it might be impossible for the Court to examine into this matter. So the conduct of the trustee not being blameable in the purchase, is nothing to the purpose; ..\nIn Keech v. Sandford[21] , a lease of the profits of a market was devised to a trustee in trust for an infant. Before the expiration of the term the lessor refused to renew an dthe trustee thereupon took a lease for his own benefit. It was however decreed that the trustee should assign the lease to the infant, the trustee to be indemnified from the covenants in the lease and to account for the profits since the renewal. Lord Chancellor King said that \"the trustee should rather have let it run out than to have ha dthe lease to himself: that it may seem hard that the trusee is the only person of all mankind who might not have the lease; but it is very proper that the rule should be strictly pursued, and not in the least relaxed.\" In the present case the individual respondents participating in the purchase of the mortgage did not acquire it simply as members of the public but \"by reason and in course of their office of directors\", to employ the language of Lord Russell in the Regal case at p. 386. In my opinion the acquisition of the mortgage was due to and prompted by the information which they, as directors, had acquired as to the small value placed by the former mortgagee upon its security, a knowledge they were in duty bound to employ for the advantage of the company and not for themselves. I do not consider that when the adjustments in the affairs of the respondent company with respect to its outstanding bonds and this mortgage were concluded in 1947, the directors ceased to have any duty toward the respondent company with respect to the mortgage. There was in my opinion a continuing duty to manage the affairs of the company, in the interests of the shareholders, including the bringing about of the most advantageous sale possible. This involved giving to the company the benefit of any additional favourable adjustment in the terms of the mortgage which subsequently might prove obtainable.\nNo attempt appears to have been made to this end. These respondents considered only their own advantage. In acquiring the mortgage for their personal benefit they placed themselves in a position where they had a personal interest conflicting with the interest of the company. The best substantiation of that fact is their subsequent conduct.\nAs already mentioned, the efforts to sell resulted, on the 11th December, 1950, in the offer presented by the respondent Smith to a meeting of directors of that date at which were present in addition to himself, the respondents Graham, Oland and Clarke. The offer which was then presented, while it provided for the purchase of the asests of the hotel and the assumption of the outstanding first mortgage bonds, stipulated that the sum of $241,500, the face value of the mortgage in question, was to be paid by purchasing or causing the second mortgage to be purchased from its holders at its face amount, in six equal half-yearly instalments. This offer, however, was not accepted, but another offer put forward at the meeting by the respondent Oland was accepted. The only difference between the Oland offer and the other was that the purchase price of the second mortgage in the Oland offer was to be paid within 2 years instead of 3, the only persons benefiting being the holders of the second mortgage. This action of the directors was subsequently approved at a general meeting of shareholders, on December 29, at which the directors voted the shares acquired from the railway company in favour of the Oland offer.\nSubsequently, on January 15, 1951, at a general meeting of shareholders called to confirm this sale and the consequent winding-up of the company, another offer was presented to the directors from an outside party. This offer did not provide for payment of the second mortgage as did the former offers, but only for its assumption. It did, however, provide for an increase of $100,000 cash in the purchase price.\nIn the result, although this last offer was much more favourable to the shareholders, and although the directors protested that in their opinion a sale and winding-up were in \"the best interests of the shareholders\", this course was not followed. Oland and Stanbury appear to have determined to acquire control of the undertaking by purchase of shares rather than by direct purchase of the assets. The minutes of the meeting contain the following illuminating entry:\nThe Chairman (Smith) then addressed the meeting stating that the directors in recommending to the shareholders the acceptance of the offer made by Col. S. C. Oland and his Associates and in voting for the Special Resolution to wind up the company (at the former meeting) had believed that it was in the best interest of the company and the shareholders generally to do so. He stated that while they had not changed their opinion in this respect they had come to the conclusion that in the circumstances that had developed it was not advisable to proceed with the winding-up of the company and they had consequently determined to vote the shares owned or represented by them against confirmation of the Special Resolution. He added that the directors, however, proposed to sell their controlling interest in the company to Colonel Oland and his Associates for the price of $25 per preference share with the common thrown in, that being the estimated amount that they would have received if the company had been wound-up.\nThe \"controlling interest\" above referred to was of course that of the directors themselves derived by reason of the shares which they had acquired from the Canadian Pacific Railway. It is transparent in the above resolution that Oland and his \"Associates\", while quite prepared to dispose of the undertaking to one of themselves on terms which would have yielded the holders the full profit involved in the acquisition of the second mortgage at approximately 50 per cent of its face value, were equally prepared to prevent the shareholders, other than themselves, from participating in any purchase of the assets of the hotel by an outside party even at an enhanced price. A sale and winding-up of the respondent company which was in the best interests of the shareholders generally on the 29th December, became something quite different on the 15th January following by reason of the emergence of a third person desiring to purchase.\nIn the court below the decision with respect to the mortgage was influenced by the fact that there was no money in the hands of the respondent hotel available to pay off the mortgage at the time when it was acquired by the individual respondents. The decision in Regal's case indicates such a question is quite irrelevant. Lord Russell, at p. 389, after referring to Keech v. Sandford (supra) and Ex Parte James[22], said:\nIt was contended that these cases were distinguishable by reason of the fact that it was impossible for Regal to get the shares owing to lack of funds, and that the directors in taking the shares were really acting as members of the public. I cannot accept this argument. It was impossible for the cestui que trust in Keech v. Sandford to obtain the lease, nevertheless the trustee was accountable. The suggestion that the directors were applying simply as members of the public is a travesty of the facts. They could, had they wished, have protected themselves by a resolution (either antecedent or subsequent) of the Regal shareholders in general meeting. In default of such approval, the liability to account must remain.\nEvery word of the above applies, in my judgment, in the case at bar.\nIt is also suggested in the judgment below that the situation might have been differently regarded had the respondent company been insolvent. Again, the decision in Regal's case is a complete answer to any such distinction as are the other authorities discussed above. It is quite true that in Larking's case[23], where Malins, V.C., acted upon the principle here in question, the company there concerned was in liquidation and the learned Vice Chancellor expressed himself to the effect that the situation might well be otherwise in the case of a solvent company. The mere existence of solvency or insolvency, however, is not the test.\nIn the case at bar the individual respondents, both in their acquisition of the shares and the second mortgage were arrogating to themselves a secret profit which, as stated by Lord Wright in Regal's case, at p. 393, is \"nothing more than a profit without the consent of the shareholders\". They did not obtain the consent of the shareholders and both transactions, therefore, for the reasons stated, cannot stand.\nWith respect to the mortgage, there should be judgment declaring that the mortgage is security only for the respective amounts paid by each in respect of its acquisition, with interest thereon at 5 per cent per annum, as asked by appellants, the said respondents to be accountable to the respondent company for any amount or amounts which may have been received or which may be received beyond such amounts and such interest. This order is, of course, subject to the provisions of the deed of trust securing the bonds by which the company may not repay any part of the principal of the second mortgage so long as any of the bonds are outstanding.\nAs the mortgage is held by the respondents Oland and Stanbury not only for themselves and the respondents Clarke and Smith but also for Delta Securities Limited, the statement of claim should be amended so as to claim against Delta, and that company should be added as a party. If Delta conceives its rights under the said mortgage as differing in any respects from the rights of the other parties as hereby declared, it will be at liberty to raise such issue, in which event the said issue will stand referred to the trial court for disposition according to the practice of that court, the costs to be in the discretion of that court. In default the said added party shall be bound by this judgment.\nThe appeal should be allowed: the appellant should have his costs throughout. ESTEY, J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons and conclusions of my brothers Kellock and Cartwright and, therefore, this appeal should be allowed with costs to the appellant throughout against all the original defendants except the Hotel Company.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014For the reasons given by my brother Kellock, I agree with his conclusions that the respondents, other than Lord Nelson Hotel Company Limited, obtained both the shares and the mortgage referred to under circumstances which render them liable to account to Lord Nelson Hotel Company Limited, hereinafter referred to as \"the Company\".\nAs to the shares I agree with the order proposed by my brother Kellock that the shares, other than the 200 preferred shares transferred to Guptill, be surrendered to the Company to be dealt with as unissued shares. Such surrender is in no sense a purchase by the Company of its own shares as it involves neither payment by the Company nor (the shares being fully paid up) the release by the Company of any liability to it. No reduction in capital is brought about as the Company parts with nothing and its authorized capital will remain unaltered, although the number of issued shares will be reduced and the number of unissued shares will be correspondingly increased. In my opinion the authorities referred to by my brother Kellock show that in the circumstances of the case at bar there is no legal objection to such a course but I wish to make it clear that I express no opinion as to whether or not such an order could have been made if the shares in question had not been fully paid up. I see no necessity to order the cancellation of the shares. The Company if it sees fit can take the necessary steps under the Companies Act to effect such cancellation.\nThe question of the proper order as to the mortgage is a difficult one. The respondents, on November 30, 1949, paid $120,000 in cash for an assignment of a second mortgage dated June 14, 1932 made by the Company on its hotel property and other assets, to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company which, as varied by the terms of an indenture of October 20, 1947, secured $241,500 principal with interest at a rate up to but not exceeding 3 per cent per annum (but not cumulative) payable exclusively out of profits. The last mentioned indenture contained provisions for calculating the annual profits of the mortgagor for the twelve month period ending on October 31 in each year and for payment of the interest if earned, or so much thereof as might be earned, on the 15th of December following. The indenture further provided that so long as any of the bonds of the Company therein mentioned remained outstanding the mortgagee would not take any steps to foreclose the mortgage or otherwise realize its security or any part thereof. Apart from this provision the principal secured by the mortgage would have been due on May 2, 1947, but as the bonds refererd to do not mature until November 1, 1967 the principal will not be payable before the latter date unless all the bonds should be earlier redeemed.\nBy an Indenture dated November 1, 1947, made between the Company and The Eastern Trust Company, the Deed of Trust securing the bonds of the Company was amended. Subclause (s) of Clause 18 of Article V of the Deed of Trust, as amended, provides:\u2014\n(s) That so long as any of the Bonds hereby secured remain outstanding the Company will not declare or pay any dividends in respect of its preference or common shares, and will not repay to Canadian Pacific Railway Company any part of the principal secured by the Mortgage made by the Company in favour of Canadian Pacific Railway Company dated the 14th day of June, 1932.\nIt will thus be seen that until all the first mortgage bonds have been redeemed not only is the mortgagee restrained from enforcing payment of the principal secured by the second mortgage but the Company, the mortgagor, is prevented from paying any part thereof. It is this circumstance which creates the difficulty as to the proper form of order which should be made in regard to the mortgage.\nBut for the circumstance just referred to I would have thought that the proper order would have been one similar to that made by the Lord Ordinary and approved by the House of Lords in Hamilton v. Wright[24], that is, that upon the Company paying to the respondents the price given by them for the mortgage with interest (less any sums received by them on account of the said mortgage) they should deal with the mortgage as directed by the Company. I would have thought, also, that it should be a term of the order that the amount found due to the respondents should be promptly paid, because, as was said by Lord Eldon in Ex Parte Bennett[25], \"the person who is to be delivered from the situation of purchaser shall be speedily delivered\". It is obvious that the value in 1949 or at this date of a second mortgage the principal of which is not payable until November 1, 1967 and meanwhile bears non-cumulative interest at the rate of 3 per cent, only if earned, must be very much less than the amount of the principal secured. The Court does not proceed against an accounting trustee by way of punishment (see the observations of Lord Cranworth L.C. in Attorney-General. v. Alford[26] and those of Lord Hatherley L.C. in Burdick v. Garrick[27]\"; and the effect of an order that the respondents can not enforce the mortgage for more than $120,000 principal and must await payment of that sum until 1967 would be not merely to deprive them of all profit but to inflict a heavy loss upon them. It is eminently .a case in which the order should provide that they be \"speedily delivered\" from this situation. This could be simply accomplished by limiting a reasonable time (perhaps the two months fixed by Lord Eldon in Ex Parte Bennett (supra)) in which the Company should pay the $120,000 and interest, but for the fact, which it is to !be remembered was known to the respondents when they purchased the mortgage, that the Company is precluded by the terms of the indenture of November 1, 1947, quoted above, from making any payment on account of the principal of the mortgage while any bonds are outstanding. In such circumstances it is the duty of a Court of Equity to make the order best suited to the actual circumstances and in my opinion it should be directed that the Company do pay to the respondents the said sum of $120,000 as soon as it is able to do so consistently with the terms of the indenture of November 1, 1947, above refererd to, together with interest thereon at the rate of 5 per cent per annum from November 30, 1949, less any sums paid to them as interest under the said mortgage, that until payment of the said sum of $120,000 the interest thereon at 5 per cent be paid annually on the 15th day of December insofar as the terms of the said indenture of November 1, 1947 permit, and that upon payment of the said sum of $120,000 and interest as aforesaid (including any interest which may be in arrears by reason of the earnings of the Company in any year or years having been insufficient to pay it) the respondents shall deal with the said mortgage as directed by the Company.\nCounsel for the appellant, in the memorandum as to the order which he submitted should be made furnished by him at the request of the Court, suggests, very fairly as I venture to think, that the rate of interest on the $120,000 should be 5 per cent. Even if he had not done so I would have held that to be the proper rate. To fix a lesser rate would be to treat the respondents harshly. At such rate the interest accruing each year will amount to $6,000 and under the terms of the mortgage as varied by the indenture of October 20, 1947, the Company was entitled and obligated to pay interest in each year, if earned, of $7,245 (i.e. 3 per cent on $241,500). While the Company is in equity entitled to the benefit of the reduction of the principal of the mortgage by the sum of $121,500, it is the barest justice that it should pay interest at the legal rate of 5 per cent on the money expended by the respondents in securing this advantage. I agree that the order proposed by my brother Kellock adding Stanbury and Company Limited and Delta Securities Limited as parties defendant should be made.\nI would allow the appeal and vary the judgments below in the manner indicated above. The appellant should have his costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs throughout against all the original defendants except the hotel company.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Russell McInnes.\nSolicitor for the respondents: F.

VI, c. 69\u2014Arts. 982, 984, 1200, 1892 C.C.\nIn 1930, the respondent, Damien Boileau Ltd., having obtained a contract for the erection of buildings for the University of Montreal, entered into a partnership with Ulric Boileau Ltd., for the purpose of exploiting the contract and any other which might be obtained from the University within thirty months following. In 1934, when the University suspended the work, the partnership agreement was amended to embrace all works which could be executed by either of the partners up to October 1943.\nIn 1939, the Legislature of Quebec, by 3 Geo. VI, c. 69, cancelled all construction agreements into which the University had entered and vested all assets of the latter in a new corporation. In November 1939, the new corporation entered into a contract for the completion of the University buildings with the respondent Damien Boileau Ltd. which the respondent executed without reference to Ulric Boileau Ltd. The appellant, as trustee for Ulric Boileau Ltd., contended, in an action for rectification of the partnership accounts, that the Statute had not had the effect of dissolving the partnership and that the second contract was but a continuation of the first.\nHeld: The appellant cannot claim any of the benefits of the second contract, since the partnership had ceased to exist in 1939. When the Statute cancelled the construction contract of 1930, the partnership, whose object was the exploitation of that contract, was left without any object. Therefore, by virtue of Art. 1892 CC., the partnership was dissolved ipso facto by the coming into force of the Statute.\nAPPEALS from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, reversing the decision of the trial judge in an action for rectification of accounts of a partnership taken by the trustee of a bankrupt partner.\nEdouard Masson Q.C. for the appellant.\nL.

Le prix \u00e9tait payable par versements mensuels de 85 p. 100 de la valeur des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, et quant \u00e0 la balance, soit 15 p. 100, elle \u00e9tait retenue par l'universit\u00e9 comme garantie pour l'ex\u00e9cution parfaite des travaux, et payable quarante jours apr\u00e8s la date d'un certificat comportant l'acceptation des travaux.\nDans le contrat de transport par Ulric Boileau \u00e0 Ulric Boileau Limit\u00e9e, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9 que le contrat pour la construction de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al serait ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 par les deux compagnies, Damien Boileau Limit\u00e9e et Ulric Boileau Limit\u00e9e en commun, et que les d\u00e9penses et obligations d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, et les profits de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, seraient divis\u00e9s en parts \u00e9gales. Il fut aussi stipul\u00e9 que les deux compagnies agiraient comme partenaires \u00e0 partir de la date o\u00f9 le contrat de construction fut sign\u00e9 avec l'Universit\u00e9, soit le 21 mars 1930, et courrait jusqu'\u00e0 l'expiration du terme fix\u00e9 pour la fin des travaux. Enfin, il fut compris que tous travaux que l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al pourrait confier \u00e0 l'une ou \u00e0 l'autre des deux parties au contrat dans le d\u00e9lai de trente mois, \u00e0 compter du 21 mars de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, seraient \u00e9galement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s par les deux parties aux m\u00eames termes et conditions que ceux mentionn\u00e9s dans le contrat.\nLes travaux ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de mars 1930, mais furent interrompus le 31 d\u00e9cembre 1931, except\u00e9 certains travaux mineurs qui ont continu\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s pour la protection de l'immeuble en 1932, et aussi certains travaux de r\u00e9parations dans le cours de 1933. En 1934, l'universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al d\u00e9cida de suspendre ces travaux, et Damien Boileau Limit\u00e9e, l'intim\u00e9e, et l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, le 16 janvier de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, ont convenu que le contrat du 21 mars 1930, pour la construction de l'Universit\u00e9, demeurerait en vigueur, mais que son ex\u00e9cution serait suspendue jusqu'au 1er octobre 1943, \"sans frais ni dommages de part et d'autre, sauf le droit de la propri\u00e9taire dans l'intervalle, de d\u00e9cider quand elle le jugerait \u00e0 propos, de reprendre et de continuer les travaux.\" Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que si les travaux n'\u00e9taient pas continu\u00e9s le ou avant le 1er octobre 1943, le contrat deviendrait nul sans que l'entrepreneur puisse exercer aucun recours en dommages.\nLa r\u00e9clamation de l'intim\u00e9e Damien Boileau Limit\u00e9e fut fix\u00e9e \u00e0 $907,725.09 dont $590,436.25 furent pay\u00e9s comptant, la balance \u00e9tant payable \u00e0 demande avec int\u00e9r\u00eats depuis le 1er d\u00e9cembre 1933, au taux de 6 per cent, capitalis\u00e9 chaque mois, taux que l'intim\u00e9e devait payer aux banques.\nEnfin, l'intim\u00e9e convint d'ex\u00e9cuter certains travaux de protection \u00e0 \u00eatre pay\u00e9s sur certificat de l'architecte, sauf un montant de 15 per cent, qui \u00e9tait payable seulement que quarante jours apr\u00e8s l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux. Ces travaux de protection commenc\u00e8rent en janvier 1934, et dur\u00e8rent jusqu'en janvier 1935.\nA ce document du 16 janvier 1934, seule l'intim\u00e9e Damien Boileau Limit\u00e9e \u00e9tait partie. Il fut cependant confirm\u00e9 et ratifi\u00e9 par Ulric Boileau Limit\u00e9e, en vertu des termes d'un contrat notari\u00e9 en date du 29 janvier 1934, et qui modifiait le contrat de transport consenti le 4 avril 1930, par Ulric Boileau \u00e0 Ulric Boileau Limit\u00e9e, et accept\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e. En vertu de ce dernier document, il \u00e9tait convenu que tous les travaux confi\u00e9s \u00e0 l'un ou l'autre des deux soci\u00e9taires par l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, durant les trente mois d\u00e9termin\u00e9s originairement pour la compl\u00e9tion des travaux, seraient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme tombant dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLa nouvelle convention du 29 janvier 1934 \u00e9tendit cette clause \u00e0 tous les travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s par l'une ou l'autre, c'est-\u00e0-dire par Damien Boileau Limit\u00e9e ou par Ulric Boileau Limit\u00e9e, jusqu'au 1er octobre 1943, et il fut convenu que ces modifications seraient consenties sans novation, ni autres d\u00e9rogations aux termes de la convention du 4 avril 1930, et que cette convention devait continuer \u00e0 avoir force et effet dans toute sa forme et teneur entre les deux compagnies jusqu'au ler octobre 1943.\nEn 1939, la L\u00e9gislature de la province de Qu\u00e9bec passa une loi (3 Geo. VI chap. 69) qui est entr\u00e9e en vigueur le 28 avril 1939. En vertu de cette loi, la L\u00e9gislature de la province de Qu\u00e9bec a form\u00e9 une corporation connue sous le nom de Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Administration de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, et la section 15 de cette loi est \u00e0 l'effet que toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mobili\u00e8res et immobili\u00e8res appartenant \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al sont transf\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, libres de toutes charges, privil\u00e8ges et hypoth\u00e8ques. La section 23 stipule que tous les contrats sign\u00e9s par l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al concernant la construction de l'Universit\u00e9 sur l'Avenue Maplewood, tous contrats d'achat de mat\u00e9riaux, de louage d'ouvrage ou de services personnels, et toutes les obligations d\u00e9coulant de telles ententes, sont annul\u00e9s \u00e0 partie du jour de l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la loi, except\u00e9 en ce qui concerne le mat\u00e9riel vendu et livr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al avant le 1er janvier 1934, que cette derni\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9e de payer au prix du march\u00e9 au moment des achats. Il est formellement d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu'aucun recours en dommages n'existera ni contre l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, ni contre la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, par suite de l'annulation prononc\u00e9e par la loi, mais en ce qui concerne les r\u00e9clamations pour lesquelles l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al devait demeurer responsable en vertu des dispositions d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9es, il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par le m\u00eame statut qu'elles seraient soumises aux membres de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui agiraient comme arbitres.\nLe 9 novembre 1939, le nouveau propri\u00e9taire des \u00e9difices de l'Universit\u00e9, soit la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Administration de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, d\u00e9cida de compl\u00e9ter la construction des immeubles. Ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9e par la loi de la L\u00e9gislature de tous ses engagements ant\u00e9rieurs, elle se croyait parfaitement libre d'accorder le nouveau contrat \u00e0 n'importe quel contracteur qu'elle pourrait choisir, et elle d\u00e9cida que le nouveau contrat serait accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9e Damien Boileau Limit\u00e9e. En vertu du contrat qui est intervenu, l'intim\u00e9e s'engagea \u00e0 compl\u00e9ter et \u00e0 terminer la construction des \u00e9difices de l'Universit\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment aux plans et sp\u00e9cifications pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par l'architecte Ernest Cormier, mais sous le contr\u00f4le d'un architecte diff\u00e9rent, M. Henri S. Labelle, nomm\u00e9 par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Administration de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. Le prix fut fix\u00e9 \u00e0 $1,056,776.10 soit la balance due et impay\u00e9e, sur le prix du contrat original du 21 mars 1930.\nIl fut cependant convenu qu'une somme additionnelle de $7,000 serait pay\u00e9e pour remplacer la machinerie, les accessoires, et qu'une somme additionnelle serait \u00e9galement pay\u00e9e, \u00e9gale \u00e0 l'augmentation du prix des mat\u00e9riaux, de la main-d'\u0153uvre, et des taxes de vente, survenue depuis le 21 septembre 1932, et dont le montant devait \u00eatre fix\u00e9 par l'architecte Henri S. Labelle.\nSi les travaux n'\u00e9taient pas termin\u00e9s dans un an, sans la faute du contracteur, chaque partie aurait le droit de demander une r\u00e9vision du prix \u00e0 cause de l'augmentation, ou de la diminuation dans le prix de la main-d'\u0153uvre, des mat\u00e9riaux et des taxes de vente, et cette demande devait \u00eatre soumise toujours \u00e0 l'architecte Labelle, qui encore \u00e9tait nomm\u00e9 le seul arbitre. En vertu du m\u00eame contrat, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 accorda des travaux additionnels au contracteur. C'\u00e9tait pour r\u00e9parer certaines parties des immeubles d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9s durant la suspension des travaux, et le contracteur s'obligea en cons\u00e9quence \u00e0 faire tous les travaux de r\u00e9paration et de r\u00e9fection que l'architecte Labelle jugerait n\u00e9cessaires, moyennant le prix que fixerait ce dernier, et qui ne ferait pas partie du prix global de $1,056,776.10.\nLe 15 juillet 1941, les travaux n'\u00e9taient pas termin\u00e9s et, tel qu'autoris\u00e9e, l'intim\u00e9e demanda une r\u00e9vision du prix d\u00e9termin\u00e9 dans le contrat du 9 novembre 1939. Une nouvelle entente fut sign\u00e9e entre l'intim\u00e9e et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, fixant le prix global de l'entreprise \u00e0 $1,430,991.79. Par une lettre \u00e9crite quelques jours plus tard, soit le 18 juillet, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a admis que ce montant n'affectait en aucune fa\u00e7on la r\u00e9clamation de l'intim\u00e9e pour travaux non pay\u00e9s, ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s \u00e0 date, et celle de $27,715.48, pour d\u00e9bours\u00e9s occasionn\u00e9s par la suspension des travaux. L'intim\u00e9e n'\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9e de donner de cautionnement pour garantir l'ex\u00e9cution fid\u00e8le des travaux, qu'elle ex\u00e9cuta d'ailleurs, sans la participation ou assistance d'Ulric Boileau Limit\u00e9e.\nLe 24 d\u00e9cembre 1941, Ulric Boileau Limit\u00e9e tomba en faillite, et le 7 janvier 1942, Georges Duclos fut nomm\u00e9 syndic \u00e0 cette faillite. Il mourut pendant que la cause \u00e9tait pendante, et Albert Lamarre, le pr\u00e9sent appelant es-qualit\u00e9, fut nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 sa place, et reprit l'instance.\nEn janvier 1942, l'appelant r\u00e9clama une reddition de compte, depuis l'ann\u00e9e 1930, en rapport avec le contrat de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. L'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9para un compte de tout ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u, et pay\u00e9 en vertu de ce contrat, mais ce bilan a \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9 par l'appelant qui a intent\u00e9 une action en r\u00e9formation de compte. Dans sa d\u00e9claration amend\u00e9e, apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9cit\u00e9 les faits ci-dessus, il conclut \u00e0 ce que le bilan produit dans la reddition de compte soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 informe et irr\u00e9gulier, et \u00e0 ce qu'il soit dit et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e devait au demandeur es-qualit\u00e9, \u00e0 titre de reliquat, la somme de $21,617.67, et \u00e0 ce qu'elle soit condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 lui payer ce montant, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat compos\u00e9, mensuellement au taux de 6 p. 100, depuis le 31 d\u00e9cembre 1941.\nLe juge au proc\u00e8s a conclu que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 dissoute comme cons\u00e9quence de la loi 3 Geo. VI, ch. 69, que l'intim\u00e9e n'avait pas droit aux montants de $7,831.69, $27,661.60 et $14,086.40 qu'il r\u00e9clamait dans sa reddition de compte, et enfin, que l'intim\u00e9e devait \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, pour int\u00e9r\u00eats, la somme de $8,348.22.\nLe juge au proc\u00e8s cependant, se rendit \u00e0 la demande des avocats des parties et se contenta de d\u00e9cider les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la contestation et confia aux comptables Ernest Robitaille et Alfred Joseph Doucet, la pr\u00e9paration de l'\u00e9tat final de la reddition de compte.\nLa Cour d'Appel 2 a unanimement renvers\u00e9 ce jugement. Elle en est venue \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il s'agissait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 d'une action pro socio, que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Damien Boileau Limit\u00e9e n'avait comme unique objet que le contrat d'entreprise accord\u00e9 par l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 Damien Boileau Limit\u00e9e, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, la loi 3 Geo. VI, ch. 69 qui a op\u00e9r\u00e9 la r\u00e9siliation du contrat, a fait tomber l'objet de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui s'est trouv\u00e9e dissoute, sans qu'aucune dissolution conventionnelle ne f\u00fbt n\u00e9cessaire. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en outre que l'intim\u00e9e avait rendu un compte complet, fid\u00e8le et int\u00e9gral, et que Ulric Boileau Limit\u00e9e en cons\u00e9quence n'avait pas \u00e9tabli sa qualit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re. Elle a statu\u00e9 en outre que les deux compagnies associ\u00e9es sont mutuellement lib\u00e9r\u00e9es de toutes dettes et obligations d\u00e9coulant de cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9, sauf quant \u00e0 une somme de $8,436.41 dont l'intim\u00e9e est rest\u00e9e cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re contre le syndic aux droits de Ulric Boileau Limit\u00e9e, mais qu'elle ne peut pas recouvrer dans l'action qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e parce qu'il n'y a pas eu de conclusion \u00e0 cette fin. L'appel a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu avec d\u00e9pens. La premi\u00e8re question qu'il importe de d\u00e9cider, est de savoir que ful l'effet de la loi 3 Geo. VI chap. 69, adopt\u00e9e par la L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Administration de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, et qui lui a transport\u00e9 tous les biens mobiliers et immobiliers de l'Universit\u00e9, et qui a r\u00e9sili\u00e9 de plein droit toutes les conventions souscrites ou consenties par l'Universit\u00e9, relativement \u00e0 la construction des \u00e9difices universitaires, ainsi qu'\u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux qui s'y rapportent.\nToute obligation doit avoir un objet (982 C.C.), et un objet est \u00e9galement n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 d'un contrat (984 C.C.). En vertu de l'article 1200 C.C., l'obligation est \u00e9teinte lorsque cet objet de l'obligation dispara\u00eet, ou que la livraison en devient impossible. Une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, comme tout autre contrat, est gouvern\u00e9e non seulement par les dispositions sp\u00e9ciales qui s'appliquent \u00e0 elle, mais aussi par les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux qui s'appliquent \u00e0 tous les contrats lorsqu'il n'y a pas de conflit. Le principe que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 se termine par la perte de son objet est express\u00e9ment formul\u00e9 au paragraphe 2 de l'article 1892, qui est \u00e0 l'effet que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 finit par l'expiration du terme, par l'extinction ou la perte des biens appartenant \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, par la consommation de l'affaire pour laquelle la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9e, par la faillite, par la mort naturelle de quelqu'un des associ\u00e9s, par la volont\u00e9 qu'un seul ou plusieurs des associ\u00e9s expriment de n'\u00eatre plus en soci\u00e9t\u00e9, suivant les dispositions des articles 1895 et 1896, et enfin, lorsque l'objet de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 devient impossible ou ill\u00e9gal.\nCet article couvre un nombre plus \u00e9tendu de cas que l'article 1865 du Code Napol\u00e9on, qui pr\u00e9voit la fin de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par l'expiration du temps pour lequel elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e, par l'extinction de la chose ou la consommation de la n\u00e9gociation, par la mort naturelle de quelqu'un des associ\u00e9s, par la d\u00e9confiture ou l'interdiction de l'un d'eux, et par la volont\u00e9 qu'un seul ou plusieurs expriment de n'\u00eatre plus en soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nCet article du Code Napol\u00e9on n'a pas, comme dans le Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, la clause que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 finit lorsque l'objet de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 devient impossible ou ill\u00e9gal, mais tous les auteurs qui ont \u00e9crit en France sur le sujet s'accordent \u00e0 dire que, dans tous les cas mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 1865 du Code Civil, chacune des cinq causes op\u00e8re le m\u00eame effet, et que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 finit sans qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire d'en demander la dissolution. Cette dissolution est op\u00e9r\u00e9e ipso facto, et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est dissoute que les associ\u00e9s le veuillent ou qu'ils ne le veuillent pas. (Merlin, \"Questions de Droit\" au mot \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\" Vol. 7, p. 577).\nLorsque l'un des cas mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 1865 du Code Napol\u00e9on se pr\u00e9sente, les associ\u00e9s ne peuvent pas maintenir l'ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9 vu qu'elle se trouve dissoute de plein droit. Sans doute, les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es peuvent maintenir la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 quand la chose est possible, mais il faut pour cela une nouvelle convention, et il se trouve par cons\u00e9quent \u00e0 y avoir une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nouvelle. (Vide Pothier, vol. 4, No 140, p. 291; Pardessus, vol. 4, No. 1054, p. 311; Guillouard, 'Soci\u00e9t\u00e9' No. 288, p. 376; Fuzier-Herman, \"R\u00e9pertoire alphab\u00e9tique\" 'Soci\u00e9t\u00e9' Nos. 625 \u00e0 630 inc.; Baudry-Lacantinerie, 3e \u00e9d. vol. 23, No. 371; 26 Laurent, No. 362).\nSi l'un des cas mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 1865 du Code Napol\u00e9on se produit, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 finit par la seule op\u00e9ration de la loi. Il s'ensuit n\u00e9cessairement que la m\u00eame solution s'impose lorsque les cas additionnels mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 1892 de notre Code Civil se pr\u00e9sentent. C'est d'ailleurs l'opinion des auteurs cit\u00e9s plus haut. Laurent dit qu'il n'y a pas de contrat sans objet et, par cons\u00e9quent, pas de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (citation supra). Dans le cas qui nous occupe, l'objet du contrat, c'est-\u00e0-dire ce \u00e0 quoi s'\u00e9taient engag\u00e9es les deux compagnies soci\u00e9taires, \u00e9tait la construction de l'immeuble de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. Comme, par l'op\u00e9ration de la loi 3 Geo. VI, chap. 69, l'objet a cess\u00e9 d'exister, il s'ensuit que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 dissoute de plein droit (Vide Mignault, vol. 8, p. 263).\nLa Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 dissoute, il s'ensuit n\u00e9cessairement que bien des questions d'ordre financier relatives \u00e0 la reddition de compte se trouvent finalement d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, vu qu'Ulric Boileau Limit\u00e9e n'a droit \u00e0 aucune participation dans les profits r\u00e9sultant du second contrat accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Damien Boileau Limit\u00e9e pour le parach\u00e8vement des travaux. L'intim\u00e9e avait incontestablement le droit de signer cet autre contrat sans l'intervention de sa premi\u00e8re associ\u00e9e, et d'en percevoir en cons\u00e9quence tous les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices\nComme r\u00e9sultat des jugements rendus et des admissions faites \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate, il ne reste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer que la question de savoir si l'intim\u00e9e a droit de r\u00e9clamer de l'ancienne Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 certains items mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 la reddition de compte et se chiffrant respectivement \u00e0 $7,831.69, $27,661.60 et $14,086.40.\nLe premier de ces items, soit $7,831.69, repr\u00e9sente la valeur d'une quantit\u00e9 de bois dont on a fait usage pour l'\u00e9rection d'\u00e9chafaudages et la construction de formes, mais qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9difice lui-m\u00eame. Ce compte \u00e9tait inclus dans le r\u00e8glement de janvier 1934, mais il fut consid\u00e9r\u00e9 non pas comme repr\u00e9sentant le prix de vente de ce bois, qui effectivement n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu, mais comme un acompte sur le contrat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, soit sur le second contrat, et dans lequel Ulric Boileau Limit\u00e9e n'avait aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat. Ceci d'ailleurs est constat\u00e9 par le certificat de l'architecte, en date du 13 avril 1936, et il s'ensuit que si le second contrat n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9, comme le dit avec raison M. le Juge Bissonnette, l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al aurait pu r\u00e9clamer ce montant des deux premi\u00e8res associ\u00e9es. C'est en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9e qui a pay\u00e9 cette dette par les travaux qu'elle a faits en ex\u00e9cutant le dernier contrat. Ce bois dont il est question dans cet item fut vendu, le produit en fut partag\u00e9 entre les deux associ\u00e9es sauf une somme de $200 dont il est tenu compte dans l'actif de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nQuant au montant de $27,661.60, il se rapporte \u00e0 la pierre de Missisquoi. Le sous-contrat pour la fourniture de cette pierre a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la Wallace Sandstone Quarries Limited le 20 mai 1930. Il fut stipul\u00e9 que le prix total serait de $183,000 payables \"au fur et \u00e0 mesure que les livraisons progresseront, moins une retenue de 15 p. 100 qui sera due et payable quarante jours apr\u00e8s la livraison finale.\" Le prix de la soumission \u00e9tait de $189,000, de sorte qu'il restait un profit de $6,000 pour le contracteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. L'ex\u00e9cution de ce contrat fut suspendue avant le mois de janvier 1935, et l'Universit\u00e9 avait, \u00e0 cette date, pay\u00e9 \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 $147,375.70, tandis que la Wallace Sandstone Quarries Limited n'avait re\u00e7u que $119,714.40, laissant cette diff\u00e9rence de $27,661.60. Cette somme repr\u00e9sente donc des argents pay\u00e9s par l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al pour des travaux non ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, et il s'ensuit n\u00e9cessairement qu'au moment de la dissolution de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, cette derni\u00e8re devait \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al ce montant de $27,661.60. C'est pourquoi lorsqu'en vertu du second contrat les travaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 repris, non pas par la vieille Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 mais par l'intim\u00e9e, on a tenu compte de ce montant de $27,661.60, et on l'a appliqu\u00e9 sur le montant du nouveau contrat.\nLe troisi\u00e8me item, se chiffrant \u00e0 $14,086.40, est en rapport avec un sous-contrat concernant les vitres pour les fen\u00eatres. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a re\u00e7u de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al une somme \u00e9gale \u00e0 la valeur de 3,968 fen\u00eatres doubles, alors qu'elle ne devait recevoir que le prix d'une m\u00eame quantit\u00e9 de fen\u00eatres simples. Il ne peut faire de doute que les entrepreneurs n'ont pay\u00e9 leurs sous-contractants que pour les fen\u00eatres simples, et lorsque, par cons\u00e9quent, le second contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Damien Boileau Limit\u00e9e, l'architecte a n\u00e9cessairement d\u00e9duit du prix global du contrat original cette somme qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e en surplus \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Comme l'intim\u00e9e se trouve \u00e0 avoir pay\u00e9 la dette de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, il est juste qu'elle recouvre sa part.\nQuant \u00e0 la question des int\u00e9r\u00eats aux montants de $2,150 et $240.42, qui doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9bit\u00e9s au compte de l'intim\u00e9e, je crois que la compensation devra s'\u00e9tablir entre le montant dont l'appelant est cr\u00e9ancier, et le montant de $8,436.41 qui est d\u00fb \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e et pour lequel cette derni\u00e8re n'a pas obtenu jugement.\nJe disposerais des deux autres appels de la mani\u00e8re sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Cour du Banc de la Reine.\nLes appels doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s avec d\u00e9pens.\nThe judgment of Kellock and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKellock J.:\u2014There are two matters in issue in this appeal. I am of opinion as to the first that the partnership constituted by the agreement of April 4, 1930, came to an end with the passing of the statute of 1939. The partnership was formed only for the purpose of exploiting the building contract of March 21, 1930, although it contained a clause which would have brought into the partnership any further contracts entered into between either of the partners and the university within the period of thirty months mentioned in the agreement of April, 1930. I think it is clear also under the agreement of the 29th of January, 1934, that the words \"all work which may be executed by them to the buildings of the University of Montreal up to the 1st of October, 1943,\" set out at page 961, lines 16 and following, are limited, by what follows, to works executed under the original contract of March 21, 1930, and any works executed under any contracts entered into between the university and either of the partners on or before the 1st of October, 1943. In other words, the paragraph in question has in view only the matters covered by the original building contract, the original thirty months' period being extended to the 1st of October, 1943. That this is so is, I think, emphasized by the fact that the paragraph above referred to provides that \"all work\" is to be executed in conformity with the agreement of April, 1930 \"under the terms of which\" the partners are obligated to share equally all benefits which may result from \"such works\" as well as all expenses, etc., which may be occasioned in relation to \"these same works.\"\nWith respect to the second matter in issue the respondent, in its account of the partnership dealings, claims credit for three items:\n(a) $7,831.69 alleged to be advances made on the certificate of the architect, Cormier, to cover the cost of scaffolding used in connection with the unfinished buildings. As to this the architect had taken the position that the contractor, the respondent, under the terms of the original contract, had to bear this cost, but in view of the possibility that the university might decide to finish the works and to call for their recommencement on or before the 1st of October, 1943, he granted a certificate with respect to this item as an \"advance\" for which the respondent was to account later;\n(b) $27,661.60, being overpayment in respect of stone delivered to the job;\n(c) $14,086.40\u2014overpayment in connection with glazing.\nThe respondent contends that these amounts represent monies paid to it by the university for which the university received no value and which the respondent was, therefore, liable to repay to the university, and subsequently, by virtue of the statute of 1939, to the Society. The respondent says that when the new building contract was entered into in 1939 between the Society and the respondent, the contract price was arrived at by taking the price provided for by the original contract of March 21, 1930, plus an amount of $7,000 to cover the cost of restoring certain dilapidations which had arisen after the cessation of work, and deducting therefrom all payments made under the original contract. The respondent claims that the above three amounts have thus been repaid by it, and as these amounts were an obligation of the original partnership, the respondent is entitled to credit therefor in the partnership accounts. This claim has been given effect in the judgment in appeal.\nWith respect to the first item in dispute, this advance had been specially made in April, 1936, in contemplation of the resumption of the works by the University in which event the amount would have been credited to the University in respect of such future work.\nThe over-payment covered by the second item of $27,661.60 was discovered in January, 1934, and presumably the same applies to the third item. But in any event all three were known in November 1939, when the new contract with the Society was entered into as the price for that contract, as already mentioned, was fixed on the basis of the original contract price of 1930, deducting therefrom the items here in dispute.\nThis being so, in my opinion, the arbitration which resulted in the judgment of 1941 can only have proceeded on the basis that these three items had been already allowed to the University. Consequently the respondent is entitled to credit in the partnership accounts for these amounts.\nWith respect to interest I think the sums of $2,150 and $240.42 allowed by the learned trial judge should be restored, but that the remaining items were properly disallowed in the Court below. It is admitted as to the former that the amount of $8,600 with respect to which this item of interest was allowed was withdrawn from the partnership funds by the respondent for the purpose of paying employees working on jobs in which the respondent was solely interested. As to the smaller amount, the respondent puts forward no answer whatever. The total of these two items is $2,390.42. I agree with the disposition of the matter of interest as proposed by my brother Taschereau. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

The latter opposed the application and upon the Board granting certification, sought by way of certiorari to quash the Board's decision and the certification. It contended that on the face of its decision the Board lacked jurisdiction in that it had found that with few exceptions the employees in question were employed in a confidential capacity within the meaning of the exclusionary clause in the definition of \"employee\" in s. 2 of the Act and that therefore they were not entitled to be included in any certification. Counsel for the Board argued contra that under ss. 2(4) and 58(1) whether a person is an \"employee\" within the meaning of the Act is a question to be determined by the Board and its decision shall be final.Farris C.J.S.C. heard the motion and ruled that a body of limited jurisdiction could not by an improper decision acquire jurisdiction and that the court had power to examine the proceedings to ascertain whether there was evidence before the Board to justify its decision. Having done so, he held that there was such evidence, and dismissed the application for the writ. His judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia which held that the Board had erred in law in the construction it placed upon the relevant definition of \"employee\" and since the employees in question were employed in a confidential capacity, exceeded its jurisdiction in granting certification and that in consequence ss. 2(4) and 58 of the Act did not prevail to prevent the court from exercising its authority to review, in this circumstance, the decision of the Board as an inferior tribunal.\nHeld: That there was evidence before the Board to justify its conclusion that the comptometer and power machine operators were not employed in a confidential capacity within the meaning of s. 2(1) (a) of the Act.

Guild, Q.C., for Canada Safeway Ltd., respondent.\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting): For the reasons stated by the Honourable the Chief Justice of British Columbia I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKERWIN J.:\u2014Pursuant to s-s. 1 of s. 10 of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act of British Columbia, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 155, the appellant Union, a \"labour organization\" as therein defined, applied to the Labour Relations Board (British Columbia), established under the Act, for certification as the bargaining authority for those employees of the respondent Company employed as \"office employees\" (except department managers and outside salesmen), at the Company's distributing warehouses in Vancouver. So far as relevant, s-s. 1 of s. 10 is in these words:\u2014\n10. (1) A labour organization claiming to have as members in good standing a majority of employees in a unit that is appropriate for collective bargaining may apply to the Board to be certified as the bargaining authority for the unit in any of the following cases:\u2014\n(a) Where no collective agreement is in force and no bargaining authority has been certified for the unit:\nSubsection 1 of s. 12 enact:\u2014\n12. (1) Where a labour organization applies for certification as the bargaining authority for a unit, the Board shall determine whether the unit is appropriate for collective bargaining, and the Board may, before certification, include additional employees in, or exclude employees from, the unit. The Board determined that such employees \"except those excluded by the Act and except those employed in the positions and in the classes of work listed on the back of this certificate\" were a unit of employees appropriate for collective bargaining. On the back of the certificate appeared the following:\u2014\nPositions and classes of work excepted from the bargaining unit.\nManagers;\nAssistant Managers;\nManagerial Secretaries;\nPersonnel Records;\nPayroll Clerks;\nChief Accountant;\nAccountant;\nSupervisor of Comptometer Operators;\nSupervisor of Power Machine Operators;\nPricing Department Clerk;\nAdvertising Clerk;\nBulletin Typist.\nIn the interpretation section of the Act, it is provided:\u2014\nEmployee means a person employed by an employer to do skilled or unskilled manual, clerical, or technical work, but does not include:\u2014\n(a) A person employed in a confidential capacity or a person who has authority to employ or discharge employees:\n(b) A person who participates in collective bargaining on behalf of an employer, or who participates in the consideration of an employer's labour policy:\n(c) A person serving an indenture of apprenticeship under the \"Apprenticeship Act\":\n(d) A person employed in domestic service, agriculture, horticulture, hunting or trapping:\nAn application for a writ of certiorari to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia was heard as if a formal order had been issued by the Court and a return made by the Board. A question has been raised as to what should be considered generally as a return by a tribunal such as the Board but it need not be determined in the present case. The Court knows the Board's decision only from a copy of its certificate sent to the solicitor for the respondent, which was produced as an exhibit to an affidavit made by Mr. Theodore Smith on the respondent's behalf, and since it appears (and is admitted) that stapled thereto was a letter from the Registrar of the Board giving the reasons for the decision, I assume that in the present case the return includes not only the certificate but the reasons therefor. I further assume in favour of the respondent that under the particular circumstances we may look at the records of the respondent, which were also made an exhibit to the affidavit, and at the affidavit itself to show what happened before the Board, since the deponent was cross-examined on that affidavit and such cross-examination is part of these proceedings. I am satisfied that on this evidence the Board and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia came to the right conclusion on the important question whether those office employees of the respondent who are comptometer operators and power machine operators are persons employed in a confidential capacity within the meaning of exclusion (a) in the definition of \"employee\". This conclusion is arrived at without reference to the provisions of s-s. 4 of s. 2:\u2014\n(4) If a question arises as to whether a person is an employee within the meaning of this Act, the question shall be determined by the Board, and the decision of the Board shall be final.\nThe Board's reasons as contained in the letter enclosing a copy of its certificate to the solicitor for the respondent are as follows:\u2014\nA prime question for the decision here is the interpretation of \"a person employed in a confidential capacity\", (S. 2(1), I.C.A. Act). The employer argues that, with a few exceptions, all of the B.C. zone office staff are employed in a confidential capacity. That is to say that those employees are handling matters which are of a confidential nature in regard to the affairs of the employer.\nIn the strict sense this view would appear to rule out such employees from any proposed bargaining unit within the scope of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Can the considerations really rest there? It seems obvious that many employees of most employers are \"confidential\" to some and to varying degree. Is not then a further consideration required as to the degree and capacity of the confidential employment met with in this application?\nModern business practice and the emergence of large office organizations require a broad approach to this problem if the Industrial Concilation and Arbitration Act is to be reasonably interpreted. Obviously one, or a few persons, could not be expected to deal with the mass of intimate information required in today's management office organization. Thus, nearly all employees in such an office handle, or have access to, confidential information. The Board's view is then, that the primary question for study is:\u2014 does this type of employment make persons so employed persons employed in a confidential capacity according to the Act, and thus rule them out from appointing a bargaining authority to act on their behalf in respect of wages and working conditions?\nMany excellent cases and facts, pro and con, were provided by counsel in hearings on this application. The Board's opinion, after study of these cases and facts, and in particular the case of Ford Motor Company of Canada, Limited, is that the question here resolves itself into a consideration of two classifications of employees which comprise the major portion of the staff employed, viz.\u2014Comptometer Operators and Power Machine Operators.\nIt is the Board's opinion that while there is merit to the case presented by counsel for the employer, justification exists for the Board to grant certification for the unit applied for, less certain classifications. These latter are: (Then follows the list that appears on the back of the certificate).\nThe Board rules that certification will issue for a bargaining unit described as: all employees, less the aforementioned categories.\nThe Board accepted the statements as to what the operators did that appear in the respondent's records as explained by Mr. Smith but counsel for the respondent submitted the Board's reasons to a searching criticism. He pointed to the statement therein:\u2014 \"Nearly all employees in such an office handle or have access to confidential information.\" Apparently, before the Board, counsel had used the word \"handle\" but I take it that by repeating the word, the Board did nothing more than adopt a convenient expression to cover the having access to confidential information. It was also pointed out that in the earlier part of its reasons the Board had stated that the respondent's argument that, with a few exceptions, all of the British Columbia zone office staff were employees in a confidential capacity would in the strict sense appear to rule out from any proposed bargaining unit within the scope of the Act all employees who were handling matters which were of a confidential nature in regard to the affairs of the employer. It was argued that this meant that while strict construction of the Act would, according to the Board, bring the operators within exception (a) to the definition of \"employee\", the Board gave some other construction not warranted by the provisions of the enactment. That is not the proper view to take of the reasons. The Board considered that the construction advanced on behalf of the respondent did not meet the proper test under the Act in relation to the operators in question, and with great respect to the members of the Court of Appeal who thought otherwise, I am of the same opinion.\nCounsel for the respondent argued that those operators should be excluded as much as \"Accountant; Supervisor of Comptometer Operators; Supervisor of Power Machine Operators;\". I disagree because, in my view, the duties of accountants and supervisors comprise much more than tabulating on machines information from various sources. An employee who had access to outgoing mail, because he was in a position to read all that was going out, or one whose duties might be to open incoming mail, could be said to have access to confidential information. It is in the same way and only to the same extent that the same could be said of the operators. On the other hand, accountants and supervisors would not merely put down figures and have them totalled but would collate the information from these figures with a view of presenting it, and making recommendations, if necessary or advisable, in connection therewith to a superior employee. The fact that an employee had access to confidential information does not mean that he was \"employed in a confidential capacity.\"\nIt has not been overlooked that in its certificate the Board excepts \"those included by the Act\". These words appear in the printed form prepared for the purpose and should have been stricken out. However, in view of the last paragraph of the Board's reasons, and also of the fact that the real dispute is as to the operators, the words may be taken as merely surplusage, or as referring to employees who might otherwise possibly fall within exceptions (b) and (c) in the definition of \"employee\". The Board's certificate cannot, therefore, be treated as meaningless.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court restored. The appellant Union is entitled as against the respondent to its costs of the appeal to this Court and of the appeal to the Court of Appeal. There should be no costs for or against the Board or the Attorney General of British Columbia.\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014I believe that the learned Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia was right in dismissing the application of the respondent for a writ of certiorari.\nI am of the opinion that there was sufficient evidence to justify the Board to come to the conclusion that certain comptometer operators and power machine operators, were not employed in \"a confidential capacity\" within the meaning of the Act, and that by virtue of s. 2(4) of the Act, its decision is final and is not open to review.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the order of the trial Judge, with costs here and in the court below. RAND J.:\u2014The question in this controversy over the certification of a labour union in British Columbia as bargaining agent hinges on the interpretation to be given the exception, \"a person employed in a confidential capacity\". The company carries on a large system of grocery stores throughout the western provinces and it is with relation to the headquarters office staff in Vancouver of the British Columbia zone that the dispute arises. The persons concerned are twenty-four operators of comptometers, nine operators of power machines, six telephone operators and two duplicating machine operators.\nThose in the first group are engaged in the preparation and assembly of all species of statistical and report material. What may be called the primary figures come to the central office from the warehouses, merchandising departments and retail stores in the zone, and are combined, consolidated or summarized in such detail and manner as the company requires. The data include all accounting particulars of the business done in each store, detailed to individual departments; the total operations of the zone in similar form and detail; and the usual statistical calculations in terms of unit volume, labour and return. In this matter appear, of course, prices, wages, bonuses, profits and other items that enter into the final result, elaborated in relation to warehouses, shops, service and all other activities of the business.\nThe power machines are used, among other things, to make out cheques to all employees except executives paid from the Vancouver office; for the preparation of the invoices of goods to the retail stores in the zone, of records showing cost prices, sale prices and profit margins throughout the zone, and of daily and quarterly reports of volume sales of individual commodities.\nThe duplicating machine operators reproduce the statistical returns already mentioned. They also distribute incoming and handle outgoing mail.\nAll of these employees are claimed to be within the exemption, but from the facts stated it is clear that the work done by them is simply the mechanical production of statements of the business, in more or less detail and reduced to significant units. This is undoubtedly information which the company does not broadcast from the housetops; but the operators do nothing to or about it except to transcribe it on paper for the use of others. Their work is basically instrumental although there is some consolidation and even, it may be, of calculation by them for the results tabulated. The disability urged arises through their exposure to that information, and the taint is said to disqualify even the clerks who handle the mail.\nThis condition is present more or less in every business and an employee is under a legal duty as a term of his employment to treat all such matters as the exclusive concern of the proprietor. But the question under the statute is not to be determined by the test whether the employee has incidental access to this information; it is rather whether between the particular employee and the employer there exists a relation of a character that stands out from the generality of relations, and bears a special quality of confidence. In ordinary parlance, how can we say that a person skilled to operate a comptometer and employed primarily because of that skill, who is presumably so fully occupied with the particular work of transcribing or consolidating, that the figures in general would mean little to him, is by that exposure converted into an employee with a \"confidential\" relation? Between the management and the confidential employee there is an element of personal trust which permits some degree of \"thinking aloud\" on special matters: it may be on matters in relation to employees, competitors or the public or on proposed action of any sort or description; but that information is of a nature out of the ordinary and is kept within a strictly limited group. In many instances it is of the essence of the confidence that the information be not disclosed to any member of any group or body of the generality of employees.\nThere is nothing of that sort here. With a large office of upwards of thirty-five employees engaged in similar occupation, the matter which they work into reports, so far as it is known to one of them, is of common knowledge throughout the office; what, practically, could prevent these employees from discussing it among themselves? and if so, what could prevent them from spreading it abroad except their duty not to do so? They occupy no exceptional position in office organization. Most of them are, at the present time, members of the union, and the objection urged is not their being members but that the certification of the union to represent them would open the floodgates of exposure of the company's business chiefly to competitors. No such information would be used by any tribunal except by compelling the company to produce it or by permitting it to be disclosed by witnesses: but no evidence would be countenanced that had been obtained by a breach of duty. The feature a union would be interested in is the financial result of the business, and in this case that fact is published to the world. And what conceivable reason could there be to induce employees, because they happen to belong to a certified union, to pass this private information on to competitors of their own employer, the consequences of which could only be to their own injury?\nThere is an element of confidence between employer and all employees and an ascending scale up to those whose relation takes on the \"confidential capacity\". The point at which that is reached is a matter of judgment to be formed by weighing all the circumstances. For example, typewritten reports on advanced stages of atomic development where fundamental concepts may be expressed in communicable formulas might well today be classed as done by one in such a capacity; in engaging a person for such work, apart from the qualification as a competent operator and as a far more important consideration, integrity and the capacity for self-discipline and control would be decisive; but in twenty-five years from now all that information may be as common as the formulas of chemistry today. In this case, efficiency units are included in the secret category: but these business health tests are in general use and frequently ordinary items for arbitration between employer and employee. There is nothing special about them or their secrecy. The technician is chosen primarily for his professional or mechanical skill; in confidential employment, personal qualities take on greater importance and may be controlling. Here there is little beyond the relation sustained by the multitude in clerical work today; and the effects of a denial to this group of the privilege of being represented by a certified union must be taken into account in interpreting the statutory language. The task of evaluating all these considerations has been committed by the legislature to the Board; and so long as its judgment can be said to be consonant with a rational appreciation of the situation presented, the Court is without power to modify or set it aside.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal and restore the order of Farris C.J.\nKELLOCK J. (dissenting):\u2014Under the provisions of s. 2(1) of the statute \"employee\" does not include\n\"a person employed in a confidential capacity.\"\nBy s-s. (4) of the same section, it is provided that\nIf a question arises as to whether a person is an employee within the meaning of this Act, the question shall be determined by the Board, and the decision of the Board shall be final.\nS. 58, s-s. (1) also provides that\nIf a question arises under this Act as to whether:\u2014\n(a) A person is an employer or employee\u2026 the Board shall decide the question, and its decision shall be final and conclusive for all the purposes of this Act except in respect of any matter that is before a Court.\nAs stated by Singleton L.J., in Rex v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal [3]:\nError on the face of the proceedings has always been recognised as one of the grounds for the issue of an order of certiorari.\nThe provisions of ss. 2(4) and 58(1) do not exclude the supervisory jurisdiction of the court with respect to such questions, as is explained by Lord Sumner in the Nat Bell case, [4]. The error alleged to be apparent on the face of the record in the case at bar is the view taken by the Board of the statutory definition of \"employee\". Although it is for the Board to determine whether or not a particular person is brought within the statutory definition, the Board may not misconstrue that definition.\nThe word \"confidential\" as it is used in the statute has, in my opinion, the sense of\n\"intrusted with the confidence of another or with his secret affairs or purposes,\"\nsee Black's Law Dictionary, 4th ed. 1952, p. 370.\nThe difference to my mind between a person employed in a confidential capacity and one not so employed is that, in the former case, for reasons, it may be, of convenience or necessity on the part of the employer in the conduct of his business or affairs, the employee is put in possesison of matter which the employer regards, from his standpoint, as secret or private. In the case of a person engaged in business on a large scale, matters which are private or secret from his standpoint must of necessity be disclosed to varying numbers of employees, depending upon the volume and scope of the affairs in question. This necessity arises from the purely physical consideration of the employer being unable to keep these matters to himself, if his business or affairs are to be properly conducted.\nThe respondent, in the case at bar, operates a number of \"chain\" stores on a large scale and of necessity requires the assistance of a considerable number of employees in dealing with matters which it desires to keep private. It is quite true that the respondent is a public company and that its annual profits or losses are published, but, to take one example given by Mr. Guild on the argument, the profitableness or otherwise of an individual store is not ascertainable from such published statements, and it is obvious that the respondent would have the best of reasons for desiring to keep such information to itself and not available to its competitors. It is detailed information of this sort with which the disputed classes of employees dealt.\nThe view of the Board with respect to the meaning of the statutory definition is disclosed by its reasons as follows:\nA prime question for the decision here is the interpretation of \"a person employed in a confidential capacity\", (S. 2(1), I.C.A. Act). The employer argues that, with a few exceptions, all of the B.C. zone office staff are employed in a confidential capacity. This is to say that those employees are handling matters which are of a confidential nature in regard to the affairs of the employer.\nIn the strict sense this view would appear to rule out such employees from any proposed bargaining unit within the scope of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Can the considerations really rest there? It seems obvious that many employees of most employers are \"confidential\" to some and to varying degree. Is not then a further consideration required as to the degree and capacity of the confidential employment met with in this application?\nModern business practise and the emergence of large office organizations require a broad approach to this problem if the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act is to be reasonably interpreted. Obviously one, or a few persons, could not be expected to deal with the mass of intimate information required in today's management office organization. Thus, nearly all employees in such an office handle, or have access to, confidential information. The Board's view is then, that the primary question for study is:\u2014 does this type of employment make persons so employed persons employed in a confidential capacity according to the Act, and thus rule them out from appointing a bargaining authority to act on their behalf in respect of wages and working conditions?\nIn my view the Board has stated, only to discard, the proper meaning of the statute, because of that very necessity that the conduct of large affairs enlarges the number of persons whom an employer must take into his confidence. For my part, I find nothing in the statute which justifies such a departure from the plain meaning of the language used by the legislature. I do not obtain any assistance from the consideration that confidential employees any more than employees who participate in management, may be members of a trade union under the statute. That is so but such employees are in neither case under the statute to be considered for the purposes of certification for collective bargaining. I adopt the language of the Chief Justice of British Columbia as follows:\nThe two disputed classifications of employees, when consideration is given to the nature of their assigned tasks, and the material with which they work, are in my opinion \"employed in a confidential capacity\" within the meaning of the Act. In consequence the Board erred in law and exceeded its jurisdiction in deciding otherwise.\nI think the conclusion of the court below is correct and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe Judgment of Estey and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The relevant facts are stated in the reasons of other members of the Court. For the respondent it is argued that the decision of the appellant Board, that certain comptometer operators and power machine operators admittedly in the employ of the respondent, did not fall within the words \"employed in a confidential capacity\" so as to be excluded from the term \"employee\" as defined in s. 2(1) of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act, R.S.B.C. 1948 c. 155, was so opposed to the evidence that the inference is irresistible that the Board misconstrued the Statute, that there is therefore error in law apparent on the face of the proceedings and certiorari lies to quash the order.\nI am in respectful agreement with the learned Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia that, on the evidence before it, it was open to the Board to come to the conclusion that the operators in question were not in fact employed in such a capacity as to be excluded from the term \"employees\" within the meaning of the Act. In such circumstances, in my opinion, effect must be given to s. 2(4) of the Act which provides that this question shall be determined by the Board and that its decision shall be final; and I do not find it necessary to inquire whether I would have reached the same conclusion as did the Board had the responsibility of making such decision been committed to the courts.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Kerwin.\nAppeal allowed with costs against the respondent in this Court and the Court below. No costs for or against the Board or the A.G. of B.C.\nL. H. Jackson, solicitor for the appellants the A.G. for B.C. and The Labour Relations Board.\nR. J.

Cette admission ne valant, uniquement, que pour les fins de l'\u00e9tude et de l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente motion pour faire annuler l'injonction interlocutoire d\u00e9cern\u00e9e sans avis; et cette admission est conforme aux attendus de la motion qui est pr\u00e9sentement entendue.\nL'honorable juge Belleau maintint la motion et d\u00e9clara l'injonction ill\u00e9gale et nulle; en cons\u00e9quence, il l'annula et la mit de c\u00f4t\u00e9. Les appelants d\u00e9clar\u00e8rent ipso facto qu'ils entendaient porter la question en appel. Acte est donn\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9claration dans le jugement qui annule l'injonction.\nCe dernier jugement affirme que, par la Loi des relations ouvri\u00e8res, la l\u00e9gislature de la province de Qu\u00e9bec a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission des privil\u00e8ges tr\u00e8s \u00e9tendus et qu'elle a voulu, pour ce qui regarde l'administration dont elle est charg\u00e9e, la soustraire \u00e0 la juridiction de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et aux ordonnances de ses juges. En ce sens il r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 l'article 41-A de cette loi qui d\u00e9cr\u00e8te qu'aucun bref de Quo Warranto, de mandamus, de certiorari, de prohibition ou d'injonction ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9mis contre la Commission, ni contre aucun de ses membres, en raison d'une d\u00e9cision, d'une proc\u00e9dure ou d'un acte quelconque relevant de l'exercice de ses fonctions, et qui ajoute que l'article 50 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure civile ne s'applique pas \u00e0 la Commission. Cet article 50 donne \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et \u00e0 ses juges un droit de surveillance et de contr\u00f4le sur tous les tribunaux: juges de circuit, magistrats et autres personnes, corps politiques et corporations de la province, \u00e0 l'exception de la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nA raison de ces prescriptions de la Loi des relations ouvri\u00e8res et \u00e9galement parce que l'honorable juge \u00e9tait d'avis que l'injonction avait pour r\u00e9sultat d'emp\u00eacher des proc\u00e9dures judiciaires, il en vint \u00e0 la conclusion que l'ordonnance d'injonction accord\u00e9e aux demandeurs est irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re, ill\u00e9gale et nulle; il la d\u00e9clare telle et il l'annule \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit.\nNotons imm\u00e9diatement l'effet de cette d\u00e9cision: l'ordonnance d'injonction, ainsi mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9, avait pour but d'emp\u00eacher l'ex\u00e9cution de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission pour la p\u00e9riode de temps pendant laquelle l'action directe en annulation de cette d\u00e9cision restait pendante devant la Cour sup\u00e9rieure. Elle maintenait le statu quo entre les parties tant que le jugement sur l'action n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu. A ce moment-l\u00e0, l'effet de cette injonction cessait imm\u00e9diatement, car le jugement sur l'action devait en m\u00eame temps d\u00e9cider si une injonction permanente serait accord\u00e9e.\nIl est \u00e9vident que le jugement qui a annul\u00e9 cette injonction est un jugement final. Le r\u00e9sultat en est que, nonobstant l'action intent\u00e9e par les appelants, rien n'emp\u00eache le Syndicat d'agir en vertu de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission et de poursuivre les appelants pour les raisons qu'ils ont invoqu\u00e9es lors de leur demande \u00e0 la Commission.\nLe jugement sur l'action en annulation de cette d\u00e9cision ne pourra avoir pour effet que, s'il est favorable aux appelants, d'y joindre une ordonnance d'injonction permanente, mais l'injonction au cours de l'action est disparue pour toujours. Saisie de cette question, la Cour du Banc de la Reine (en appel) 2 a accord\u00e9 la requ\u00eate des intim\u00e9s demandant le rejet de cet appel, en donnant pour motif le propre jugement de cette Cour dans la Cause de l'Association patronale des Manufacturiers de chaussures du Qu\u00e9bec v. Dependable Slipper and Shoe Mfg. Co. Ltd. 3 L'appel fut en cons\u00e9quence renvoy\u00e9 et la Cour ordonna que le dossier fut transmis \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nSi l'on se r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 cet arr\u00eat de la Cour du Banc du Roi, dans la cause de l'Association patronale v. Dependable Slipper, l'on constate que, dans cette affaire, l'appel fut rejet\u00e9 comme irr\u00e9gulier et ill\u00e9gal pour le motif que le jugement dont il s'agissait l\u00e0 \u00e9tant un interlocutoire l'appel n'avait pas au pr\u00e9alable \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 selon que le veut l'article 1211 du Code de proc\u00e9dure.\nCet article d\u00e9cr\u00e8te que l'appel d'un jugement interlocutoire n'a lieu que sur la permission accord\u00e9e par un des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi, sur requ\u00eate sommaire, accompagn\u00e9e de copie de pi\u00e8ces de la proc\u00e9dure qui peuvent \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaires pour d\u00e9cider si le jugement en question est susceptible d'appel, et tombe dans l'un des cas sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s en l'article 46 du Code.\nA son tour, l'article 46 C.P. sp\u00e9cifie les cas o\u00f9 il peut y avoir appel d'un jugement interlocutoire.\nOn aurait profit\u00e9 du fait que la Cour du Banc du Roi \u00e9tait alors saisie de l'appel de l'Association patronale v. Dependable Slipper pour annoncer que, d\u00e8s lors, les juges de la Cour \u00e9taient unanimes \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre \"qu'un jugement qui accorde ou refuse l'\u00e9mission d'une injonction interlocutoire apr\u00e8s l'institution d'une action ou instance principale, est un interlocutoire soumis quant \u00e0 l'appel aux r\u00e8gles et conditions des art. 1211 et 46 C.P.\" et on aurait pos\u00e9 comme r\u00e8gle \"qu'il ne peut y avoir en toute instance principale qu'un jugement final et des interlocutoires. Le jugement final est proprement celui qui termine un proc\u00e8s et met fin \u00e0 l'instance sur le fond; le jugement interlocutoire est celui qui est prononc\u00e9 durant le proc\u00e8s, savoir entre l'institution de l'action ou de la demande initiale principale et le jugement qui y met fin, et comprend toute d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 un incident; le jugement final est, sous r\u00e9serve de l'art. 43 C.P., appelable de plano; quant aux jugements interlocutoires, ils sont appelables ou non selon qu'ils sont d\u00e9finitifs ou provisoires.\"\nL'article 43 C.P., auquel r\u00e9f\u00e8re cette d\u00e9claration de la part de la Cour, est celui qui \u00e9dicte qu'il y a appel \u00e0 la Cour du Banc du Roi si\u00e9geant en appel de tout jugement final rendu par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, except\u00e9 dans certains cas qui y sont mentionn\u00e9s.\nSans doute, il y aurait lieu de se demander si la Cour d'Appel a d'autres pouvoirs que celui de d\u00e9cider des causes qui lui sont soumises et si elle pouvait, ainsi qu'elle l'a entrepris dans le cas qui nous occupe, rendre un arr\u00eat qui est, en somme, un amendement au Code de Proc\u00e9dure civile. Cette question se poserait si nous devions en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que cette d\u00e9claration en marge du jugement re l'Association patronale v. Dependable Slipper serait de nature \u00e0 lier la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada. Mais, comme devant la Cour supr\u00eame la question est ouverte, il n'y a pas de raison pour entrer dans la discussion de la juridiction de la Cour d'appel pour proc\u00e9der comme elle l'a fait dans cette instance.\nL'on peut comprendre que la Cour ait voulu par l\u00e0 d\u00e9finir sa situation en l'esp\u00e8ce \u00e0 raison des jugements contradictoires qui avaient jusque-l\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus.\nAinsi, dans la cause de Arnold v. Cole 4, la Cour ne s'\u00e9tait pas prononc\u00e9e d'une fa\u00e7on aussi cat\u00e9gorique; elle avait bien dit:\nA judgment pronounced in an intermediate state of the cause is an interlocutory judgment within the classification given in article 46 C.P., notwithstanding that it may have definitively adjudicated upon the issue submitted;\nmais elle avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 cette d\u00e9claration des mots: \"In general\", impliquant n\u00e9cessairement que ce n'\u00e9tait pas une d\u00e9cision applicable \u00e0 tous les cas.\nEn 1929, dans la cause de M\u00e9thot v. Town of Montmagny 5, la Cour du Banc du Roi avait clairement \u00e9mis l'avis que:\nA judgment dissolving an interlocutory injunction is a final judgment and may be appealed from de plano.\nCette d\u00e9cision fut rendue par la majorit\u00e9 compos\u00e9e des honorables juges Tellier, Bernier, Rivard et Hall. L'honorable juge Gu\u00e9rin \u00e9tait dissident. En 1940, dans la cause de Liberty Tobacco Shops Ltd. v. Lapointe 6, la m\u00eame Cour, compos\u00e9e de Sir Mathias Tellier, Juge en chef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et de MM. les juges Rivard, Hall, St-Germain et Walsh, d\u00e9cidait:\nUn jugement prononc\u00e9 par un juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure refusant l'\u00e9mission d'une injonction interlocutoire est un jugement final dont appel peut \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 de plein droit et sans permission.\nLa Cour est all\u00e9e m\u00eame plus loin et elle a ajout\u00e9 :\nLa Cour d'appel doit rejeter une requ\u00eate demandant cette permission.\nDans le rapport, on cite en note plusieurs jugements dans le m\u00eame sens et l'on r\u00e9f\u00e8re entre autres \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame dans la cause de Ville de St-Jean v. Molleur 7. Dans cette cause, le Juge en chef Fitzpatrick, parlant au nom des honorables juges Davies, Idington, Maclennan et Duff, fait remarquer au cours de son jugement (p. 154):\nIt has been argued that there can be only one final judgment in each action, that is to say, the judgment that finally disposes of the whole action; but I do not think that such a limited construction should be put upon the words 'final judgment'; although it might be said that if adopted the result would be to give to these words their literal meaning. The French text-writers interpret or define the term 'jugement d\u00e9finitif', which corresponds with 'final judgment', by comparison with and in opposition to 'jugement provisoire, jugement pr\u00e9liminaire et jugement interlocutoire', all of which they include under the general classification of 'jugements avant faire droit'.\nLe Juge en chef proc\u00e8de alors \u00e0 examiner la doctrine des auteurs fran\u00e7ais: Boitard; Colmet-Daage; Dalloz; Carr\u00e9 et Chauveau; Pigeau. Il fait remarquer que Dalloz, Laurent et Pigeau \"all concur in the opinion that there may be several final judgments in the same case, in the sense that there may be several judgments in the same case which finally decide and dispose of particular grounds of action or issues, without finally disposing of the whole action\" (p. 155). Et, par la suite, il d\u00e9clare (p. 156) :\nThe effect of the judgment appealed from was to put an end to the issues raised by the courts with respect to which the demurrer was maintained and to that extent the action was finally disposed of and it was 'chose jug\u00e9e'.\nI r\u00e9f\u00e8re ensuite \u00e0 Shields v. Peak 8; Chevallier v. Cuvillier 9; Baptist v. Baptist 10 et finalement McDonald v. Belcher 11. Il fait remarquer que, dans chacune de ces causes, la Cour supr\u00eame, et dans la derni\u00e8re, le Con- seil Priv\u00e9, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les jugements sur les inscriptions en droit partielles pouvaient constituer chose jug\u00e9e s'il n'y avait pas appel et que, d\u00e8s lors, il faut n\u00e9cessairement les consid\u00e9rer comme jugements d\u00e9finitifs.\nSuivant l'expression de Lord Halsbury, dans cette derni\u00e8re cause :\nWhen by a judgment a distinct and separate ground of action is finally disposed of, it is in the ordinary use of the words a final judgment with respect to that ground of action.\nDans cette cause de Ville de St. Jean v. Molleur, en cons\u00e9quence, la Cour supr\u00eame fut unanime \u00e0 juger:\nthat each count (of a demurrer) contained a distinct ground on which forfeiture could be granted and a judgment depriving the municipality of its right to rely on any such ground was a final judgment in respect thereof which could be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nEt la Cour entretint dans ce sens un appel d'un jugement sur une inscription en droit partielle.\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rons en particulier \u00e0 cette phrase du jugement du Juge en chef Fitzpatrick (p. 158) :\nThe controversy regarding the matters raised by them is as effectually and conclusively disposed of. And it is this quality of conclusiveness which determines the character of a judgment as a final judgment, not its relation in point of time to other proceedings.\nIl y aurait lieu, sans doute, de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e9galement au jugement de cette Cour re Davis v. Royal Trust 12, mais, sur le point qui nous occupe, nous n'avons fait dans ce jugement que suivre ce qui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de la Ville de St-Jean v. Molleur et analyser le jugement re Davis ne constituerait que la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de notre jugement re Ville de St-Jean v. Molleur.\nIl est peut-\u00eatre important, cependant, de ne pas oublier l'arr\u00eat de la m\u00eame Cour du Banc du Roi re Allard v. Cloutier 13 o\u00f9 cette Cour a adopt\u00e9 des r\u00e8gles fixes sur l'\u00e9mission des injonctions interlocutoires. Ces r\u00e8gles se trouvent r\u00e9dig\u00e9es dans le jugement lui-m\u00eame, mais je me contenterai d'y r\u00e9f\u00e9rer sans entrer davantage dans la discussion de cette question.\nEn tout respect, l'article 46 du Code de proc\u00e9dure n'a aucune application \u00e0 l'instance actuelle. Cet article ne fait qu'\u00e9dicter les cas o\u00f9 un jugement interlocutoire est susceptible d'appel. Mais il faut le remarquer, il s'agit de l'appel d'un jugement interlocutoire. Par cons\u00e9quent, cet article ne s'applique pas \u00e0 un jugement final.\nCet article ne pr\u00e9tend pas d\u00e9finir ce qu'est un jugement interlocutoire; il se contente d'\u00e9num\u00e9rer trois cas dans lesquels un jugement interlocutoire est susceptible d'appel.\nLa question que nous examinons ici n'est pas si nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence de l'un des cas o\u00f9 un jugement interlocutoire est susceptible d'appel. Nous nous demandons si nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d'un jugement final. Le chapitre XXXVIII du Code de proc\u00e9dure, qui est consacr\u00e9 aux injonctions, nous aide sous ce rapport. Il contient l'article 966 dont se sont pr\u00e9valus les intim\u00e9s pour demander l'annulation de l'injonction qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e aux appelants, vu qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cern\u00e9e sans avis. Mais, si l'on r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 l'article 969, il est significatif qu'il contient la prescription suivante:\nL'injonction interlocutoire reste en vigueur nonobstant le jugement final qui l'annule lorsque le requ\u00e9rant d\u00e9clare \u2026 etc.\nL'on y d\u00e9finit donc bien le jugement qui annule une injonction interlocutoire sous le qualificatif de \"jugement final.\"\nEn plus, l'article 969 prescrit une proc\u00e9dure qui semble bien exclure l'appel d'un jugement qui annule une injonction interlocutoire de toutes les r\u00e8gles ordinaires de l'appel. Il \u00e9nonce, en effet, que lorsque le requ\u00e9rant d\u00e9clare imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 du jugement (n.b.-ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans le cas actuel) qu'il entend le porter en appel et qu'il fait signifier dans les deux jours qui suivent l'inscription en appel, l'injonction interlocutoire reste en vigueur.\nSi l'on devait d\u00e9cider que le jugement qui annule une injonction interlocutoire n'est pas un jugement final, mais rien autre chose qu'un jugement interlocutoire, il serait impossible de suivre cette proc\u00e9dure, car il est \u00e9vident que faire signifier l'inscription d'appel dans les deux jours qui suivent le jugement deviendrait une impossibilit\u00e9 mat\u00e9rielle. s'il fallait dans l'intervalle obtenir la permission d'appeler de la part d'un juge de la Cour d'Appel, ainsi que le prescrit, pour les cas ordinaires, l'article 1211 du Code de proc\u00e9dure.\nDe toute fa\u00e7on, je suis donc d'avis qu'il faut d\u00e9cider que le jugement qui annule une injonction interlocutoire, en vertu de l'article 966 C.P., est un jugement final. C'est peut-\u00eatre un cas d'exception, si l'on veut, aux r\u00e8gles g\u00e9n\u00e9rales pos\u00e9es par la Cour d'appel dans la cause de l'Association patronale v. Dependable Slipper (supra), que l'on a voulu appliquer \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce. Et le jugement rendu ici n'irait pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 l'encontre de l'arr\u00eat de la Cour du Banc du Roi dans cette autre cause; les deux jugements ne sont pas incompatibles. Il s'ensuivrait seulement que le cas qui nous occupe n'est pas couvert par les r\u00e8gles g\u00e9n\u00e9rales qui ont alors \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es.\nDans ces circonstances, je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu, mais, comme le jugement a quo n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu que sur le motif de juridiction, il y a lieu de suivre ici la m\u00e9thode que nous avons adopt\u00e9e dans la cause de Montreal Tramways v. Creely 14 et de renvoyer le dossier \u00e0 la Cour du Banc de la Reine pour qu'elle se prononce, ainsi qu'il est indiqu\u00e9 dans les notes de mon coll\u00e8gue le juge Fauteux; le tout avec d\u00e9pens, tant de cette Cour que de la Cour du Banc de la Reine (en appel).\nKerwin J. (dissenting) :\u2014This Court granted leave to the Wabasso Cotton Company Limited, to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) of the Province of Quebec. That judgment dismissed an appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court setting aside an interlocutory injunction which had been granted without notice. The Court of Queen's Bench followed its own decision in l'Association Patronale v. Dependable Slippers 15. Prior to the latter, judicial opinion in the Province of Quebec had fluctuated upon the question as to what is a final or interlocutory judgment within the meaning of the relevant articles of the Code of Civil Procedure. The extent of this variation appears elsewhere and need not be repeated.\nIn my opinion the answer to the question is to be found in a comparison of Articles 43 and 46 C.C.P. Article 43 provides:\u2014\n43. (1) Unless where otherwise provided by statute an appeal lies to the Court of King's Bench, sitting in appeal, from any final judgment rendered by the Superior Court,\n\u2014with certain stated exceptions. By Article 46:\u2014\n46. An appeal also lies from an interlocutory judgment in matters susceptible of appeal, in the following cases:\n1. When it in part decides the issues.\nIn the present case, if the judgment setting aside the interlocutory injunction is a final judgment, there was an appeal de plano to the Court of Queen's Bench, while, if it is an interlocutory judgment within Article 46, leave is required from one of the Judges of the Court of Queen's Bench (Article 1211) and no leave was obtained.\nUpon consideration, I find myself, with respect, unable to agree with the judgment proposed. I do not repeat all the arguments that have been advanced pro and con because my view may be stated very shortly. It is quite true that Article 46 commences \"An appeal also lies from any interlocutory judgment\" and that, therefore, there still remains the problem to determine what is interlocutory, but I take it that Article 46 contemplates that there are interlocutory judgments which in part decide the issues. Reading Articles 43 and 46 together I conclude that while the judgment of the Superior Court decided an issue, the final judgment from which an appeal de plano is given by Article 43 means a judgment which finally disposes of the entire litigation.\nI should dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nFauteux J:\u2014L'unique question soumise et \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer est celle de savoir si un jugement maintenant la motion autoris\u00e9e par l'article 966 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile et annulant une injonction interlocutoire d\u00e9cern\u00e9e sans avis est, au sens de la loi sur la juridiction de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, un jugement final dont on peut appeler de plano (art. 43 C.P.C.) ou l'un de ces jugements interlocutoires susceptibles d'un appel (46 C.P.C.), sujet, cependant, \u00e0 une permission pr\u00e9alable (1211 C.P.C.). Dans la premi\u00e8re alternative et contrairement \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision, la Cour du Banc de la Reine aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement saisie de l'appel sur le jugement annulant l'injonction interlocutoire et le dossier devra, en cons\u00e9quence, lui \u00eatre retourn\u00e9; dans la seconde, la permission pr\u00e9alable n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9e, cet appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9. La question en est donc une de juridiction et non pas de pratique en mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dure.\nIl convient, je crois, de bien pr\u00e9ciser d'abord la nature de l'injonction interlocutoire et les cons\u00e9quences de ce jugement qui l'a annul\u00e9e, en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nL'injonction interlocutoire est une mesure dont l'effet et l'objet visent exclusivement au maintien du statu quo pendente lite. C'est donc, en soi, un rem\u00e8de manifestement ind\u00e9pendant et distinct de tous ceux dont l'obtention est\u2014 et peut \u00eatre\u2014recherch\u00e9e par l'action et conditionn\u00e9e par son succ\u00e8s. Sans doute, et en fonction de la p\u00e9riode de temps pour laquelle il est \u00e9tabli, ce rem\u00e8de est, pour cette raison, de nature provisoire; mais la nature du rem\u00e8de ne fait pas la nature du jugement qui en dispose. Les deux ne peuvent \u00eatre confondus. Le jugement qui, ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination du litige, refuse ou annule une injonction interlocutoire lorsque, comme ici, les motifs vainement invoqu\u00e9s pour la justifier \u00e9puisent tous les moyens all\u00e9gu\u00e9s au soutien de l'action elle-m\u00eame, est\u2014sauf appel sur icelui \u2014un jugement \u00e9cartant avec finalit\u00e9 dans la cause, et le rem\u00e8de et le droit d'y recourir \u00e0 nouveau. En effet, ni le jugement sur l'action, ni l'appel de ce dernier jugement ne peuvent modifier l'effet de ce jugement refusant ou annulant l'injonction interlocutoire. D'une part, le jugement sur l'action,\u2014sauf appel,\u2014met fin au litige et alors cessent d'exister la raison d'\u00eatre et l'objet du rem\u00e8de. Ce jugement sur l'action, susceptible d'ordonner des injonctions pour l'avenir, ne prononce donc pas d'injonction interlocutoire; mais, suivant qu'il maintienne ou renvoie l'action, il peut confirmer ou infirmer celles qui, avant son prononc\u00e9, \u00e9taient en vigueur. D'autre part et au cas d'appel du jugement sur l'action, l'injonction interlocutoire qu'il a confirm\u00e9e ou celle qu'il a infirm\u00e9e reste\u2014cette derni\u00e8re, aux conditions de l'article 969\u2014en vigueur. Mais si aucune injonction interlocutoire n'existait au moment m\u00eame du prononc\u00e9 du jugement sur l'action il n'est plus loisible d'en obtenir pour les fins de la cause. De plus, et en tel cas, et \u00e0 moins que le jugement ne maintienne l'action et ne prononce des injonctions pour l'avenir, il en est fait, dans la cause, du droit de toute injonction pendant l'appel. En effet, l'article 969 autorise bien la Cour d'Appel ou\u2014hors du terme\u2014deux de ses Juges, \u00e0 suspendre les injonctions alors en vigueur, mais il ne pourvoit pas, au stage de cette nouvelle instance que constitue l'appel, \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission d'injonctions interlocutoires dans la cause. C'est qu'au terme o\u00f9 ce rem\u00e8de particulier pouvait \u00eatre demand\u00e9,\u2014en premi\u00e8re instance,\u2014 il ne l'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ou s'il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9, ou accord\u00e9 pour \u00eatre subs\u00e9quemment annul\u00e9, avant la d\u00e9termination du litige. En somme, et dans tous ces cas, on n'a pas, en premi\u00e8re instance, justifi\u00e9, lorsque requis, du droit \u00e0 son obtention et le jugement renvoyant l'action au m\u00e9rite a implicitement confirm\u00e9 le bien-fond\u00e9 du refus ou de l'annulation.\nCons\u00e9quemment et sauf appel du jugement qui, en l'esp\u00e8ce, a annul\u00e9 l'injonction interlocutoire, ce jugement dispose avec finalit\u00e9 dans la cause, et de ce rem\u00e8de, et du droit d'y recourir.\nLe droit d'appeler de ce jugement dans une cause par ailleurs susceptible d'appel, n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en doute et il serait, semble-t-il, contre toute conception des raisons donnant lieu \u00e0 se cr\u00e9ation que ce rem\u00e8de puisse \u00eatre aussi d\u00e9finitivement et \u00e0 toutes fins \u00e9cart\u00e9 dans la cause par un jugement sans appel. Ainsi, un d\u00e9fendeur pourrait, par exemple, d'ans une instance au p\u00e9titoire, proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la d\u00e9molition compl\u00e8te d'un immeuble dont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 serait ensuite, par jugement sur l'action, attribu\u00e9e au demandeur. En ce cas, m\u00eame le droit \u00e0 l'injonction permanente, judiciairement reconnu, deviendrait illusoire. l'injonction permanente n'ayant plus d'objet, pourrait-elle m\u00eame \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e? La Cour d'Appel s'est prononc\u00e9e dans la n\u00e9gative dans M\u00e9thot v. Town of Montmagny 16, voir particuli\u00e8rement p. 340. Aussi bien, la seule question contest\u00e9e est celle de savoir si l'appel est de plein droit ou s'il doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9alablement permis.\nIl se peut que g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement et suivant la notion qu'on adopte d'un jugement interlocutoire, le jugement en question soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme tel; mais l\u00e0 n'est pas la question. Il s'agit ici de la juridiction donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour du Banc de la Reine et c'est d'apr\u00e8s la loi accordant et fixant cette juridiction, que la question de savoir si ce jugement est appelable en vertu des dispositions de l'article 46, plut\u00f4t qu'en vertu des dispositions de l'article 43, doit \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e. L'article 46 prescrit qu'il y a appel de tout jugement interlocutoire dans les mati\u00e8res susceptibles d'appel, dans les cas suivants:\n1. Lorsqu'il d\u00e9cide en partie du litige;\n2. Lorsqu'il ordonne qu'il soit fait une chose \u00e0 laquelle il ne peut \u00eatre rem\u00e9di\u00e9 par le jugement final;\n3. Lorsqu'il a l'effet de retarder inutilement l'instruction du proc\u00e8s.\nOn ne saurait dire que le jugement en question d\u00e9cide en partie du litige. Si, dans un sens restreint, on envisage que le litige c'est le d\u00e9bat sur l'injonction interlocutoire, le jugement en dispose en totalit\u00e9. Si, dans un sens plus large, on envisage que le litige c'est l'action, le jugement ne porte pas sur le fond du litige. Sur ce point, il se distingue manifestement d'un jugement maintenant une inscription en droit partielle ou totale. Ce qu'il d\u00e9cide est \u00e9tranger \u00e0 ce qui devra \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination du litige. Pour refuser l'injonction interlocutoire ou annuler celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cern\u00e9e sans avis, le Juge appr\u00e9cie mais ne d\u00e9cide pas le m\u00e9rite de l'action ; l'appr\u00e9ciation qu'il en fait pour les fins du jugement qu'il doit rendre, pas plus que le jugement qu'il rend, ne d\u00e9cident en partie du litige, le Juge du proc\u00e8s demeurant libre d'adopter, apr\u00e8s audition sur le m\u00e9rite de l'action, des vues diam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9es. Ajoutons qu'on a jug\u00e9 dans la cause d'Allard v. Cloutier 17, et, encore, r\u00e9cemment, dans Parkovnick v. Ducharme 18, qu'il y a appel d'un jugement refusant l'\u00e9mission d'une injonction interlocutoire m\u00eame dans le cas o\u00f9 le bref n'est pas encore \u00e9mis. On ne pourrait affirmer que tel jugement \"d\u00e9cide en partie du litige\" alors que l'action n'est pas encore prise. De plus, et advenant en ce cas que le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure soit maintenu, il ne reste plus aucune proc\u00e9dure pendante devant la Cour.\nLe jugement en question ne peut davantage tomber dans le deuxi\u00e8me cas de l'article 46 puisque, refusant ou annulant l'injonction interlocutoire, on ne peut dire \"qu'il ordonne qu'il soit fait une chose \u2026\". Interpr\u00e9tant cette partie de la disposition, le Juge Rivard, dans son Manuel de la Cour d'Appel, p. 100, no 188, dit:\nIl faut remarquer les paroles de cette loi: \u2026 'lorsqu'il ordonne qu'il soit fait une chose' \u2026 Le l\u00e9gislateur n'a pas dit \u2026 'lorsqu'il a pour effet de permettre qu'il soit fait une chose\u2026\nQuand elle est claire, il convient de s'en tenir \u00e0 la lettre d'une disposition l\u00e9gale. Le jugement refusant ou annulant l'injonction interlocutoire n'ordonne rien mais, sur le point, laisse effectivement les parties dans la position o\u00f9 elles se trouvaient avant la demande d'injonction. Dans les deux cas, la partie contre laquelle l'injonction interlocutoire pouvait \u00eatre d\u00e9cern\u00e9e ou maintenue ne re\u00e7oit, de ce jugement refusant ou annulant, aucun ordre de ne pas faire et aucune permission de faire ce que l'injonction interlocutoire aurait pu l'emp\u00eacher de faire si son \u00e9mission eut \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e ou confirm\u00e9e lorsque attaqu\u00e9e suivant l'article 966. En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne crois pas qu'on puisse assimiler cette situation \u00e0 celle d\u00e9crite par la Cour du Banc du Roi dans San Martin v. Compania Ingeniera 19. En refusant, en cette cause, d'\u00e9carter du dossier une procuration log\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite d'un jugement l'ordonnant, on pouvait peut-\u00eatre dire que l'effet du jugement subs\u00e9quent refusant le rejet \u00e9tait, \u00e0 cause du jugement ant\u00e9rieur, de permettre que la cause proc\u00e8de avec la procuration produite. Sans la production de cette procuration, la marche de cette cause \u00e9tait fatalement interrompue et, avec elle, les proc\u00e9dures devaient se poursuivre. Les deux cas ne sont pas assimilables et je ne crois pas que ce jugement puisse s'appliquer en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nEnfin, et de toute \u00e9vidence, on ne peut dire que le jugement refusant ou annulant l'injonction interlocutoire a \"l'effet de retarder inutilement l'instruction du proc\u00e8s\". Il faut donc \u00e9carter l'article 46.\nSi fond\u00e9e, cette conclusion n'implique pas d'elle-m\u00eame que le jugement est couvert par les dispositions de l'article 43 mais il en r\u00e9sulte qu'\u00e0 moins qu'il ne le soit, c'est \u00e0 tort qu'on aurait toujours reconnu qu'il y avait appel de ce jugement car, l'article 46 \u00e9tant \u00e9cart\u00e9, cet appel, en l'absence des dispositions sp\u00e9ciales l'autorisant, ne saurait se fonder que sur l'article 43.\nL'article 43\u2014depuis amend\u00e9 par 1-2 Elizabeth II, chap. 18, art. 7, mais tel qu'il doit se lire pour les fins de la pr\u00e9sente cause\u2014prescrit:\n43. I. A moins qu'il ne soit autrement \u00e9dict\u00e9 par une loi, il y a appel \u00e0 la Cour du banc du roi si\u00e9geant en appel de tout jugement final rendu par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, except\u00e9:\na. Dans le cas de certiorari;\nb. Dans les causes o\u00f9 la somme demand\u00e9e ou la valeur de la chose r\u00e9clam\u00e9e est de moins de deux cents piastres. 2. Il y a cependant appel \u00e0 la Cour du banc du roi si\u00e9geant en appel, des jugements finals suivants de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, quel que soit le montant en litige;\na. Lorsque la demande se rapporte \u00e0 des honoraires d'office, droits, rentes, revenus ou sommes d'argent payables \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9;\nb. Lorsque la demande se rapporte \u00e0 des droits immobiliers, rentes annuelles ou autres mati\u00e8res dans lesquelle les droit futurs des parties peuvent \u00eatre affect\u00e9s;\nc. Lorsqu'il y a contestation sur un titre \u00e0 des terres ou h\u00e9ritages;\nd. Dans les actions en d\u00e9claration d'hypoth\u00e8que.\nIncidemment, on notera d'abord que cet article ne dit pas qu'il y a appel \"du jugement final\", mais \"de tout jugement final\", et aussi que rien dans ce texte ou dans celui des articles qui suivent, ne sugg\u00e8re que le L\u00e9gislateur ait dit, express\u00e9ment ou implicitement, qu'il n'y a qu'un seul jugement final en toute cause.\nPour d\u00e9cider que le jugement annulant l'injonction interlocutoire n'est pas un jugement final, la Cour d'Appel s'est repos\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9cision qu'elle avait rendue en 1948 dans l'Association Patronale v. Dependable Slippers 20. La seule cause \u00e0 laquelle on r\u00e9f\u00e8re est celle d'Arnold v. Cole 21, qui est invoqu\u00e9e comme justification d'une directive donn\u00e9e pour les affaires pendantes et \"o\u00f9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 le Juge en son cabinet a refus\u00e9 une permisison d'appeler pour l'unique motif qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire, qu'il y avait ouverture \u00e0 un appel de plano\". D'ailleurs, cette d\u00e9cision portait sur une situation diff\u00e9rente et le principe \u00e9tabli n'est pas absolu. Il faut regretter que la d\u00e9cision dans l'Association Patronale v. Dependable Slippers ne soit aucunement motiv\u00e9e en fonction de la proc\u00e9dure sp\u00e9cifique sur laquelle elle porte. En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, les d\u00e9clarations qu'on y trouve, en y faisant cependant des r\u00e9serves,\u2014 tel que, par exemple, \"qu'il ne peut y avoir, en toute instance principale, qu'un jugement final et des interlocutoires\", ne disposent pas de la question, mais la posent v\u00e9ritablement. L'utilit\u00e9 de motifs s'av\u00e9rait d'autant plus que la d\u00e9cision elle-m\u00eame, tel que d'ailleurs reconnu au factum de l'intim\u00e9, vient en conflit avec la jurisprudence de la Cour d'Appel. Voir les causes suivantes: Cowansville Hotel Co. Ltd. v. Beatty 22 ; M\u00e9thot v. Town of Montmagny 23 ; Taylor v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al 24 ; Liberty Tobacco Shops Ltd. v. Lapointe 25 ; Parkovnick v. Ducharme 26, voir particuli\u00e8rement, 527.\nAjoutons que des d\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es, les deux premi\u00e8res s'appuient sur le jugement de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada dans Ville de St-Jean v. Molleur 27.\nTous ces jugements de la Cour d'Appel supportent la proposition que le jugement refusant ou annulant une injonction interlocutoire est un jugement dont il y a appel de plein droit; et nonobstant la longue p\u00e9riode de temps couverte par cette jurisprudence, le L\u00e9gislateur n'est pas intervenu pour la modifier.\nD'Autre part, l'intim\u00e9, au soutien du jugement a quo a cit\u00e9 les causes suivantes:\u2014\n(i) de la Cour d'Appel :\nWampole v. Lyons 28 ; Ottawa and Hull Power Manufacturing Company v. Murphy 29 ;\n(ii) de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada:\nStanton v. Canada Atlantic Railway Company 30 ; Faucher v. La Compagnie de St-Louis 31; Bruce et al v. Fuller 32 ; Horner v. Marien 33 ; (Jugement du 24 f\u00e9vrier, 1949).\n(iii) du Comit\u00e9 judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9:\nGoldring v. La Banque d'Hochelaga 34.\nLa consid\u00e9ration de ces causes invite les commentaires suivants.\nLes deux d\u00e9cisions de la Cour d'Appel sont ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la jurisprudence contraire plus haut mentionn\u00e9e et aucune d'elles n'est motiv\u00e9. Seule, la premi\u00e8re porte sur le point car, dans la seconde, il ne s'agit pas d'un jugement refusant ou annulant une injonction interlocutoire, mais\u2014ce qui est bien diff\u00e9rent\u2014d'un jugement la confirmant. Quant aux d\u00e9cisions de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, elles portent sur une question \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00e0 celle qu'il faut d\u00e9cider. Il s'agissait, dans ces causes, de d\u00e9terminer la juridiction de la Cour Supr\u00eame suivant la loi qui lui est propre, et non celle de la Cour du Banc de la Reine suivant les dispositions qui la r\u00e9gissent. En aucun de ces cas la Cour a-t-elle affirm\u00e9 qu'au sens de la loi sur l'appel \u00e0 la Cour du Banc de la Reine, il n'y a en toute instance principale qu'un seul jugement final.\nEnfin, dans Goldring v. La Banque d'Hochelaga, le Comit\u00e9 judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 d\u00e9cida qu'un jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine affirmant un jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure,\u2014lequel avait rejet\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pour faire casser un bref de capias,\u2014n'est pas un jugement final au sens de l'article du Code autorisant les appels au Conseil Priv\u00e9. Jug\u00e9e sous l'empire de l'ancien Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, o\u00f9 la loi sur l'appel \u00e0 la Cour du Banc de la Reine \u00e9tait, dans la substance et la forme, manifestement diff\u00e9rente de celle \u00e9tablie par le Code de 1897 et de ce qu'elle est depuis lors, je ne crois pas que cette d\u00e9cision soit utile \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de l'esp\u00e8ce. La raison de ce jugement appara\u00eet \u00e0 la partie soulign\u00e9e de l'extrait suivant o\u00f9 sont indiqu\u00e9s entre parenth\u00e8ses, pour fins de corr\u00e9lation, les articles du Code actuel:\nThe argument in support of the order of the Court has proceeded chiefly upon s. 822 (923) of the same Code which is one of those which relate to procedure in respect of writs of capias. That article appears to Their Lordships clearly to imply that the decisions to which it relates are no more than interlocutory orders. If the decision of the Superior Court on the matter therein referred to had been regarded as a final judgment, there would have been no necessity to give by this article special leave to appeal because it would have been appealable under art. 1115 (43) as pointed out by Mr. Digby.\nL'article 1115, tel qu'il se lisait avant l'abrogation et le remplacement, en 1891, des articles 1114 \u00e0 1142(a), prescrivait :\n1115. Il y a appel au m\u00eame tribunal de tout jugement final rendu par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, except\u00e9 dans les cas de certiorari, de mati\u00e8res concernant les corporations municipales ou offices municipaux, tel que pourvu en l'article 1033.\nA ce temps, l'appel \u00e9tait donc la r\u00e8gle ; et, ni le montant en litige, ni la nature de la demande n'en affectaient l'op\u00e9ration. L'exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle \u00e9tait limit\u00e9e aux cas de certiorari ou aux mati\u00e8res concernant les corporations municipales ou offices municipaux. On pouvait peut-\u00eatre, alors, argumenter que si le L\u00e9gislateur avait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme final le jugement dont il permettait l'appel \u00e0 l'article 822, il \u00e9tait inutile d'\u00e9dicter cet article puisque l'appel de ce jugement \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pourvu \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'article 1115.\u2014Le contraire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9, cependant, par la Cour du Banc de la Reine, en 1874, dans la cause de The Canadian Bank of Commerce v. Brown et al 35. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, on ne pourrait faire aujourd'hui le m\u00eame raisonnement car la loi est maintenant diff\u00e9rente en sa forme et substance et, ainsi que le signale le Juge Rivard dans son Manuel de la Cour d'Appel au no 203, page 115, il n'est plus exact de dire que l'appel chez nous est de r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. L'article 44 de notre Code pourvoit bien aujourd'hui \u00e0 un appel de ce jugement; mais le m\u00eame article autorisant aussi l'appel des jugements rendus dans les mati\u00e8res non conten-tieuses, on ne saurait d\u00e9duire de sa pr\u00e9sence que le L\u00e9gislateur a n\u00e9cessairement trait\u00e9 les jugements qui y sont mentionn\u00e9s, comme des jugements interlocutoires.\nSomme toute, de la jurisprudence cit\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9, seule la cause de Wampole v. Lyons (supra) est au point. D\u00e9pourvue, cependant, de tous motifs et ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 toute cette jurisprudence \u00e9tablie et subs\u00e9quemment suivie par la Cour d'Appel, elle n'en justifie pas la mise \u00e0 l'\u00e9cart.\nDans Moiteur v. La Ville de Saint-Jean (supra) la Cour Supr\u00eame \u00e9tait appel\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9cider, et d\u00e9cida que le jugement maintenant une inscription en droit partielle \u00e9tait un jugement final, au sens de la loi de la Cour Supr\u00eame. En l'occurrence, toutefois, la Cour, appr\u00e9ciant la nature v\u00e9ritable du jugement maintenant l'inscription en droit partielle, consid\u00e9ra le conflit existant chez les auteurs fran\u00e7ais relativement \u00e0 la question de savoir s'il pouvait y avoir plus d'un jugement final dans une cause et se rangea avec les tenants de l'affirmative.\nDans Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec v. Lefebvre Limit\u00e9e 36, le Juge Rivard, approuv\u00e9 par la majorit\u00e9, disait ce qui suit, au bas de la page 78 :\nIl y a des d\u00e9cisions dont on peut dire qu'elles sont interlocutoires \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du proc\u00e8s parce qu'elles sont prononc\u00e9es durant l'instance, mais qui sont finales \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'incident auquel elles mettent fin parce que cet incident est distinct du reste de l'affaire, n'affecte pas le fond du d\u00e9bat, se produit en marge de la proc\u00e9dure r\u00e9guli\u00e8re et forme, pour ainsi dire, un proc\u00e8s particulier ind\u00e9pendant du proc\u00e8s principal. En vue de la formation de l'appel, ces d\u00e9cisions doivent \u00eatre trait\u00e9es comme finales. Telle est la d\u00e9cision de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure sur la validit\u00e9 d'une \u00e9vocation. Elle est d\u00e9finitive et finale. Appel peut en \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 de plano.\nLe savant Juge, dans son Manuel de la Cour d'Appel, \u00e9nonce avec autorit\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appui, la proposition suivante, \u00e0 la page 96, no 179:\nCertains jugements, quoique rendus durant une instance principale, mettent fin \u00e0 un incident distinct et pour ainsi parler, \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s particulier. On les traite comme finals ; ils le sont, en effet, quant \u00e0 l'incident qu'ils terminent.\nCette citation, supportant les pr\u00e9tentions de l'appelant, manifeste aussi le danger d'une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en la mati\u00e8re. Aussi bien convient-il de restreindre \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce les vues ici exprim\u00e9es.\nEn somme, il m'est impossible, en l'absence de raisons convaincantes au contraire, d'\u00e9carter toutes ces autorit\u00e9s et la valeur qu'il convient d'y attacher pour accepter la proposition que le jugement qui a annul\u00e9 l'injonction interlocutoire en l'esp\u00e8ce, n'est pas un jugement final.\nJe maintiendrais l'appel; avec d\u00e9pens tant de cette Cour que de la Cour du Banc de la Reine ; d\u00e9clarerais que la Cour du Banc de la Reine a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement saisie de l'appel par l'inscription en appel, et lui retournerais le dossier pour consid\u00e9ration de toute question pouvant \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e sur un appel log\u00e9 de plano.\nKellock J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal by leave from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, of the Province of Quebec, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court, dated March 4, 1952, setting aside an interlocutory injunction.\nThe respondent mis-en-cause obtained from the respondent Commission on February 5, 1952, leave to take proceedings against the appellants for certain conduct of the latter alleged to be prohibited by section 20 of the Labour Relations Act, R.S.Q., 1941, c. 162A, as enacted in 1944 by . 8 Geo. VI, c. 30, s. 1, provided such proceedings were taken by March 7 following.\nOn the 11th of February, the appelants commenced this action to set aside the order granting leave on the ground that it had been made without due opportunity on the part of the appellants to be heard. On the same day the appellants obtained an interlocutory injunction restraining the respondent Syndicat from acting upon the said order. This injunction was issued without notice to the respondents, who, on March 4, obtained judgment setting it aside. The appellants inscribed in appeal on March 5 following. The respondent Syndicat thereupon moved the Court of Appeal to dismiss the appeal on the ground that no appeal lay without leave and that no leave had been obtained. The Court of Appeal, following its earlier decision in L'Association Patronale v. Dependable Slipper Company 37, dismissed the appeal. The appellants now appeal to this court.\nThe question in issue depends upon the true construction of Articles 43 et seq., of the Code of Procedure. The appellants contend that\nTout jugement qui dispose, d'une fa\u00e7on finale, d'un droit de l'une ou de l'autre des parties ou qui d\u00e9termine d\u00e9finitivement le droit d'une des parties sur un point, et auquel il ne pourra \u00eatre rem\u00e9di\u00e9 par le jugement final, est en lui-m\u00eame un jugement final, bien qu'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9 au cours d'une instance.\nThe question as to what is a final judgment within the meaning of the Articles above referred to was very carefully considered by the Court of Appeal almost forty years ago in Arnold v. Cole 38. Cross J., who delivered the judgment of the court, pointed out at p. 360, at an early stage of his judgment, that the provincial legislature in enacting the Code of Procedure of Quebec had\nnot adopted arts. 451 and 452 of the Code of Procedure of France which establish a distinction between 'jugements pr\u00e9paratifs' and 'jugements interlocutoires' and between both of these and 'jugements d\u00e9finitifs'.\nThe learned judge went on to say that if one were to distinguish \"(irrespective of the articles of the Code respecting appeals) between a 'jugement interlocutoire' and a 'jugement d\u00e9finitif',\" a guide might be found in such statements as, e.g., that of Laurent, Vol. 20, No. 23, namely:\nQuand un jugement interlocutoire en apparence, d\u00e9cide r\u00e9ellement un point contest\u00e9 entre les parties, il est d\u00e9finitif, et il a, par cons\u00e9quent, l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e.\nSuch a test, however, was rejected by the court as having any applicability to the question of determining, for purposes of appeal, what is a final judgment under the appeal provisions of the provincial Code. At p. 362 the learned judge said:\n\u2026 the first thing to be done is to ascertain in what sense the Code, in the part of it which confers the right of appeal, makes use of the word 'interlocutory.' Doing so, it can be seen that final judgments are not distinguished from interlocutory judgments by application of any such test as that indicated in the citations above made,\nor, it might be aded, by any such test as the present appellants put forward as above set out.\nAfter quoting the provisions of Article 46, the learned judge went on to say, at page 363:\n\u2026 of greater significance as to the question now being considered\u2014 we see that, amongst interlocutory judgments, are included judgments which 'in part decide the issues'. Now, if we revert to the test afforded in the citations above made, it is clear that judgments which in part decide the issues are pro tanto 'Jugements d\u00e9finitifs' so that Art. 46 would mean that an appeal lies from interlocutory judgments when they are in part final judgments. In a lesser degree, the same observation would apply to clause 2 of the Article respecting orders which cannot be remedied by the final judgment.\nCross J. states his conclusion, on the same page, as follows :\nI, therefore, conclude that the effect of the Code of Procedure is to include in the class interlocutory judgments many decisions and orders which in theory are final judgments, and that this order of imprisonment is one of such interlocutory judgments.\nAfter referring to certain decided cases which had already been decided in accordance with the view he had expressed, the learned judge also said, at p. 365:\nThere is therefore authority for the view that the term 'interlocutory' does not stand in contradiction to the term 'definitive' and that a judgment may be both interlocutory and definitive if it does not put an end to the pendency of the action literally, a judgment pronounced in the period between the commencement and the end of the action is inter locutus. I take it that that is the distinction which would naturally be acted upon in formulating a practice code, and that in such code on the one hand judgments which put an end to the pendency of the action would be classed as final whereas all others would be considered 'interlocutory'.\nAt p. 366 Cross J. poses the question:\nIs it to be understood then that, as regards appeal, final judgments are to be considered as meaning only those which disseize the Court and end the contestation \u2026?\nAfter referring to judgments in actions for partition, for a declaration of partnership, for revocation of deeds or for removal from office, where the judgment which maintains or dismisses the action is the judgment from which, in his view, an appeal lies to the Court of Appeal de plano, the learned judge said, at p. 367:\n\u2026 it may be said, that, in general, any judgment pronounced in an intermediate stage of the cause is, for the purpose of appeal to this Court, an interlocutory judgment, notwithstanding that it may be final in its effect and operation. To express the same thing in other words, such a judgment, though theoretically final, is interlocutory in relation to the main action or matter before the Court \u2026\nThe italics are mine throughout.\nThe words \"in general\" have reference to the particular cases mentioned above which the learned judge had just discussed.\nAt p. 368, the learned judge points to the difference between a final judgment for purposes of appeal to the Court of Appeal and a final judgment for purposes of an appeal from that court to the Supreme Court, as follows :\nThus, it may happen, as it did in La Ville d'Iberville vs Molleur, that, while application for leave to appeal to this Court was necessary\u2014and was in fact made,\u2014the action was nevertheless appealable to the Supreme Court of Canada because of its being a final judgment within the meaning of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., chap. 139, sec. 2(2). See also Denman vs Clover, Bar Coal Co., 48 Can., 318. It is, in each case, primarily a matter of statutory construction of enactments giving the right of appeal.\nIn Molleur's 39 case this court applied the test adopted by Fitzpatrick C.J., at page 158, namely, that\nWhen by a judgment a distinct and separate ground of action is, to use Lord Halsbury's words, 'finally disposed of', it is in the ordinary use of the words a final judgment with respect to that ground of action.\nThis test the learned Chief Justice applied to the definition of \"final judgment\" in the Supreme Court Act as it then stood, R.S.C., 1906, c. 139, sec. 2(e), namely:\nany judgment, rule, order or decision whereby the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding is finally determined and concluded.\nThe learned Chief Justice was not, if for no other reason than that the point was not before this court, considering whether or not the test he applied to the construction of the Supreme Court Act had any application to the construction of the Quebec Code of Procedure. In Molleur's case the judgment of the Superior Court had been considered to be an interlocutory judgment and leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal had been granted. To my mind, the reasoning of Cross J. in Arnold v. Cole as to the proper construction of the Code of Procedure is unanswerable. In my view, Article 46, paragraph 2, recognizes that a judgment which, although\nit in part decides the issues,\nis nonetheless an interlocutory judgment and renders untenable the contention here put forward by the appellant. This view is, in my opinion, further supported by the Articles of the Code which deal with the subject-matter here in question, namely, injunctions.\nThis subject-matter is dealt with in chapter 38, commencing with Article 957. That Article authorizes the granting of an interlocutory injunction\n(1) at the time of the issue of the writ of summons, or\n(2) during the pendency of a suit.\nIt may be observed at the outset that paragraph 2 of Article 957 makes a clear distinction between \"an interlocutory order of injunction\" and the \"final judgment.\"\nThe subsequent Articles of the chapter proceed upon the same view. Article 968 is really a definition. It provides that the \"final\" judgment adjudicates upon the conclusions of the petition as well as upon the merits of the action. There can be no mistake about this. The final judgment is that which terminates the suit. No other judgment rendered while the suit is pending meets the requirements of this definition.\nUnder Article 969 any final judgment confirming an interlocutory judgment is to remain in force notwithstanding an appeal, while if a final judgment dissolves an interlocutory injunction the latter remains in force if the petitioner immediately upon the rendering of judgment, declares his intention to appeal and within two days serves his inscription in appeal.\nIt is therefore plain that this chapter proceeds upon the same view of what is a \"final\" judgment as do Articles 43 and 46.\nIt is to be observed that by reason of Article 960 the application for an interlocutory injunction is to be made by petition and normally must be on notice; Art. 961. Article 957 contemplates, therefore, that the application for the injunction may be made before the actual issue of the writ, as the injunction may be granted when the writ is issued. Apparently based upon this fact, it has for some time been considered in the courts of the province that if the grant of an interlocutory injunction be refused, the petitioner need not issue the writ but may take proceedings in appeal; Allard v. Cloutier 40. It was also held that if the injunction is issued without the writ and the defendant does not object at the time, he will be considered to have acquiesced, the matter being simply one of procedure. In that particular case, an interlocutory injunction had been granted and presumably leave to appeal had been obtained. It is noteworthy that Lamothe C.J. states in his reasons at p. 568:\nL'injonction est devenue un incident dans une cause, ou une proc\u00e9dure 'interlocutoire'.\nIt was long ago held by the Court of Appeal in Wampole v. Lyons 41, that a judgment refusing a petition for an interlocutory injunction made before the issue of the writ was an interlocutory judgment from which no appeal lay without leave. Without noticing this decision, a single judge, Archambeault C.J., in Cowansville v. Beatty 42, decided in the contrary sense, basing his judgment on Molleur v. St. Jean 43.\nAgain, in 1929, the case Methot v. Montmagny 44, came before the Court of Appeal. This was an appeal from a judgment upon motion dissolving an interlocutory injunction. The respondent had moved to dismiss the appeal upon the ground that the judgment in appeal was interlocutory and that no leave to appeal had been obtained. The motion was dismissed, Guerin J. dissenting. Hall J., who delivered the judgment of the majority, does not discuss any of the Articles of the Code, nor was the decision in Arnold v. Cole cited. His judgment proceeds upon the view that the judgment in appeal was a final judgment\nsince it settles once and for all the incidental issue in connection with the injunction.\nThe learned judge relies in support of his view upon the decision in Ville St. Jean v. Molleur 45, which, as already pointed out, was considered in Arnold v. Cole and dealt with a totally different question.\nIn 1933 also, St. Jacques J., in Taylor v. Montreal 46, delivered a similar judgment, but so far as the report shows, the earlier authoritative decisions were not drawn to his attention and the judgment itself contains no reference to the relevant Articles of the Code. In 1940 the Court of Appeal in Liberty Tobacco Shops Ltd., v. Lapointe 47, decided the same point in the same way but again, so far as the report shows, without any consideration of the earlier authorities, nor was the Code itself discussed. In all of these cases, as in Wampole v. Lyons, an injunction had been refused and the writ had not been issued.\nIn this state of the authorities the Dependable Slipper case came before the Court of Appeal, when the provisions of the Code itself, as well as the authorities, were carefully considered. In that case the appellant had launched his petition and had commenced action. The petition for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed and an appeal was taken without leave having been obtained. It was unanimously held that the judgment sought to be appealed was interlocutory and, in the circumstances, no appeal lay. The court expressed its view that had the judgment granted the injunction, it would equally have been interlocutory. In my view, with respect, this judgment is in accord with the true construction of the relevant Articles of the Code as decided in Arnold v. Cole ubi cit, to which decision the court expressly referred. In the case at bar the Court of Appeal have followed that decision and, in my view, rightly so.\nIt is objected that a judgment refusing an interlocutory injunction of the character of that here in question, or a judgment setting aside such an injunction before trial, does not come within any of the cases provided for by Article 46, and from this it is sought to be argued that such a judgment must be final for purposes of appeal. Even if the true view should be that such a judgment is not within the terms of Article 46, it would not mean that such a judgment should be considered as final within the meaning of Article 43 but merely that it is not appealable at all.\nIn San Martin v. Compania Ingeriera 48, however, the Court of Appeal held that the Article 46(2) was not to be construed as so limited. In that case an action having been brought by the plaintiff, whose head office was outside the jurisdiction, an order was made requiring it to file a power of attorney, and this was complied with. The appellant moved to reject from the record the documents filed, and the motion was dismissed. On appeal, the respondent contended that the judgment appealed from did not fall within any of the paragraphs of Article 46. Cross J. pointed out that if the order stood, the effect would be that the defendants would be obliged to submit to having the action proceed to trial on the merits, though it might turn out not to have been authorized and the plaintiff not to have been properly before the court. At page 528 he said :\nIt is true that the judgment does not affirmatively order anything to be done, but having regard to the effect of it, I consider, nevertheless, that it falls within clause 2 of Article 46 as being one of those interlocutory judgments which are made appealable\n'when they order the doing of anything which cannot be remedied by the final judgment'.\nIf the paragraph may be so read (I do not so decide as it is unnecessary to do so in the present instance) it would seem that an order refusing or quashing an interlocutory injunction would equally be within its terms. If, however, the Article may not be so read, this would not necessarily establish that such a judgment is thereby brought within the terms of Article 43, but merely that, while still interlocutory, there would be no right of appeal at all.\nIn the case at bar it cannot be argued that the judgment in appeal is to be considered final because there is nothing left to be disposed of by any judgment at trial. That is not so. While a charge was laid by the respondent Syndicat following the judgment of March 4, further proceedings have been adjourned. The merits of the present action have still to be disposed of and their disposition will no doubt govern the proceedings in the court of summary jurisdiction. Moreover, nothing that has been decided by the judgment of March 4 will be binding upon the judge at the trial of the present action: Faucher v. St. Louis 49; Davis v. Royal Trust 50.\nIt may be observed that the remedy by way of injunction is a conception which derives, not from the civil but from English law. It is a remedy by which a person entitled to a right may restrain its invasion or threat of invasion by another. The interlocutory injunction is a temporary conservatory measure designed to protect the alleged right until such time, normally after a trial, when its existence or non-existence can be finally investigated. The granting or refusal of an interlocutory order is determined upon \"the balance of convenience\" as it appears at the time. As stated in Kerr on \"Injunctions\", 6th Edition, p. 2:\nThe interlocutory injunction is merely provisional in its nature, and does not conclude a right \u2026 In interfering by interlocutory injunction, the Court does not in general profess to anticipate the determination of the right, but merely gives it as its opinion that there is a substantial question to be tried, and that till the question is ripe for trial, a case has been made out for the preservation of the property in the meantime in statu quo.\nShould a plaintiff, denied an interlocutory injunction, elect not to proceed further with the litigation, the order refusing the injunction may be termed \"final\" in the sense of being the last judgment in point of time, but it is not final in the sense of determining the existence or nonexistence of the right alleged. The order is, of course, final in the sense that it determines the right of the plaintiff to an interlocutory injunction on the material filed but if it should ultimately be decided that the existence of the right alleged is well founded and the remedy by way of injunction is not then appropriate or is ineffective, appropriate remedy by way of damages will be awarded. Denial of an interlocutory injunction, whether the plaintiff elects or does not elect to proceed, cannot convert such an order into a final judgment in the sense of a final determination of the right put forward by the plaintiff. And no interlocutory judgment becomes final in the sense of being the last judgment contemplated by a proceeding merely because a plaintiff does not elect to pursue the normal course of the litigation beyond that stage.\nIf, in the eye of the Code of Procedure, a judgment issued \"during the pendency\" of the suit (Article 957(2)), and therefore interlocutory in that sense, is also interlocutory for the purposes of appeal even although \"it in part decides the issues\" or \"le litige\" (Article 46(1)), and consequently is not final within the meaning of Article 43, I am unable to accept the view that a judgment, equally interlocutory under Article 957(2), can nonetheless be final within the contemplation of Articles 43 and 46, although merely an incident in the action, purely temporary in nature, and incapable of constituting chose jug\u00e9e or standing in the way of another application for the same relief on other material.

All the shares of company A. and company S. were owned by two brothers, their brother-in-law and the son of one of the brothers. The Minister regarded all three companies as related corporations by virtue of s. 36(4) of the Income Tax Act and designated company S. to receive the benefit of the lower tax rate for the years 1949 and 1950 under s. 36(1) and companies W. and A. to be assessed under s. 36(2). The assessment was confirmed by the Exchequer Court.\nUnder s. 36(4), a corporation is related to another if one of them owned directly or indirectly 70 per cent or more of all the issued common shares of the capital stock of the other, or if 70 per cent or more of all the issued common shares of each are owned directly or indirectly by (i) one person, (ii) two or more persons jointly, or (iii) persons not dealing with each other at arm's length, one of whom owned directly or indirectly one or more of the shares of each of the corporations. Held: (Estey J. dissenting), that company W. was not related to either company A. or company S. as neither company owned directly or indirectly 70 per cent of the shares of company W.; nor were 70 per cent of the shares of company W. owned directly or indirectly by one person or by two or more persons jointly; and even though companies A. and S. were persons not dealing with each other at arm's length, neither of them owned any shares in the other.\nPer Curiam: Companies A. and S. were related corporations within the meaning of s. 36(4)(b)(iii), since the shares of both, being owned by persons connected by blood relationship or marriage, were owned by persons not dealing with each other at arm's length.\nPer: Taschereau, Locke and Fauteux JJ.: The two brothers and the son were connected by blood relationship since they stood in lawful descent from a common ancestor (In re Lanyon [1927] 2 Ch. 264), and the brother-in-law, since he was married to a sister of the two brothers, was connected with them by marriage within the meaning of s. 127(5)(c).\nPer Cartwright J.: To be deemed by s. 127(5)(b) not to deal with each other at arm's length, corporations must be controlled by the same person; it is not sufficient that they are controlled by the same group of persons.\nPer Cartwright J.: Shareholders, either individually or collectively, do not have any ownership direct or indirect in the property of the company in which they hold shares.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1 Archibald J., holding that both appellant companies were related corporations.\nM. M. Grossman Q.C. for the appellants.\nJ. D. C. Boland and K. E. Eaton for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Locke and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nLocke, J.:\u2014These appeals were taken by Army and Navy Department Stores (Western) Limited, a company incorporated under the Companies Act of British Columbia, and Army and Navy Department Stores Limited, a company incorporated under the Companies Act of Alberta, from judgments delivered by the late Mr. Justice Archibald in the Exchequer Court 2, and were heard together.\nThe facts to be considered are, however, not identical and the appeals must be considered separately.\nThe British Columbia company, which I will refer to as the Western Company, carries on business in the City of New Westminster. For its fiscal year ending October 31, 1949, the company filed a return showing a profit of $58,651.96 and computed its tax under the provisions of the Income Tax Act at $17,055.15, which amount was paid. By an assessment dated October 24, 1950, the Minister of National Revenue assessed the company a tax for the said period in the amount of $19,061.08. The dispute is as to its liability for this difference.\nSection 36 of the Income Tax Act (11-12 Geo. VI, cap. 52) 1948, as amended both before and after the Western company made its return, as it applied to income for the year\n1949, reads as follows:\u2014\n36. (1) The tax payable by a corporation under this Part upon its taxable income or taxable income earned in Canada, as the case may be, (in this section referred to as the 'amount taxable') for a taxation year is, except where otherwise provided,\n(a) 15 per cent of the amount taxable if the amount taxable does not exceed $10,000, and\n(b) $1,500 plus 38 per cent of the amount by which the amount taxable exceeds $10,000 if the amount taxable exceeds $10,000.\n(2) Where two or more corporations are related to each other in a taxation year, the tax payable by each of them under this Part for the year is, except where otherwise provided by another section, 38 per cent of the amount taxable for the taxation year.\n(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), where two or more corporations are related to each other, the tax payable by such one of them as may be agreed by them or, if they cannot agree, as may be designated by the Minister shall be computed under subsection (1).\n(4) For the purpose of this section, one corporation is related to another in a taxation year if, at any time in the year,\n(a) one of them owned directly or indirectly 70 per cent or more of all the issued common shares of the capital stock of the other, or\n(b) 70 per cent or more of all the issued common shares of the capital stock of each of them is owned directly or indirectly by\n(i) one person,\n(ii) two or more persons jointly, or\n(iii) persons not dealing with each other at arms length one of whom owned directly or indirectly one or more of the shares of the capital stock of each of the corporations.\nThis section is applicable to the 1949 and subsequent taxation years.\n(5) When two corporations are related, or are deemed by this subsection to be related, to the same corporation at the same time, they shall, for the purpose of this section, be deemed to be related to each other.\nSection 127 as it applied to that period read:\u2014\nFor the purposes of this Act,\n(a) a corporation and a person or one of several persons by whom it is directly or indirectly controlled,\n(b) corporations controlled directly or indirectly by the same person, or (c) persons connected by blood relationship, marriage or adoption, shall, without extending the meaning of the expression 'to deal with each other at arms length' be deemed not to deal with each other at arms length.\nThe difference between the amount of the tax of the Western company for the period as computed by it and the amount of the tax assessed was due to the fact that the Minister assessed the tax under ss. (2) of s. 36, while the company claimed that the tax should be levied under the provisions of ss. (1). The company gave a notice of objection to the assessment to the Minister who confirmed the assessment. The company then appealed to the Income Tax Appeal Board and, in a considered judgment delivered by Mr. R. S. W. Fordham, Q.C. on October 29, 1951, for the Board, the appeal was dismissed.\nThere is no record of the proceedings before the Board before us and we are not informed as to whether or not evidence was given by the appellant. The Minister of National Revenue, in notifying the company that he had confirmed the assessment, had stated that the assessment rested on the ground that the taxpayer and the Army and Navy Department Stores Limited were related companies, within the meaning of ss. (4) of s. 36: the company referred to was apparently the Alberta company, one of the appellants in these proceedings. The judgment of the Tax Appeal Board found that one half of the shares of the Western company were owned by the Alberta company and that the other half, less two shares, was owned by a Saskatchewan company of the same name. The shareholdings in the Alberta and Saskatchewan companies were found to be as follows:\nAlberta company Saskatchewan company\nshares shares\nH. R. Cohen\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 50,000 H. R. Cohen\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 100,000\nS. J. Cohen\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 10,000 S. J. Cohen\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 100,000\nS. D. Leshgold\u2026\u2026\u2026... 40,000 J.W.Cohen\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 50,000 As to the remaining shares in the Western company, it was found that H. R. Cohen was the owner of one and that the remaining share was owned by a stranger. After finding that H. R. Cohen and S. J. Cohen were brothers and Leshgold their brother-in-law and that J. W. Cohen (a son of S. J. Cohen) was a blood relation of the two first named, the reasons for judgment proceeded:\u2014\nWhile the said 2,500 shares of the appellant company's stock are owned by the Alberta company as such, and not by the individual shareholders of the latter, I find it difficult to escape the conclusion that there was at least indirect control of the appellant company by H. R. Cohen, S. J. Cohen and S. D. Leshgold. Bearing in mind the far-reaching words found in section 36(4) (b), 'owned directly or indirectly', it does not, I think, conflict with the effect of Salomon v. Salomon, (1897) A.C. 22, to hold that these three holders (sic) of the Alberta company were in a position to exercise full, even if indirect, control over the activities of the appellant company by virtue of their substantial holdings in the former. In the case of H. R. Cohen, his voting power was augmented by his two-fifths interest in the Saskatchewan's company's shares. It is significant too that he was also not at arm's length with its two other shareholders, they being closely related to him.\nThe Minister's decision did not show which of the two prairie province companies was deemed related to the appellant company. It matters little, however, as both companies' shares were held mostly by the Cohens, and the shareholdings of each company in the appellant company's stock were about equal, as indicated above.\nIt is apparent from the reasons delivered that there was no evidence before the Tax Appeal Board that the two shares in the Western Company to which reference was made were the property of the Saskatchewan company, as was shown in the evidence taken before Archibald J. It was there shown by the evidence of the secretary of the Saskatchewan company that it was the owner of 2,500 of the shares of the Western company but held a certificate for 2,498 shares only, one share having been issued to H. R. Cohen and one to S. D. Leshgold, in order to qualify them as directors. The transfer form on the back of these two certificates had been signed by Cohen and Leshgold respectively and it was shown that the shares were held by the solicitors for the Saskatchewan company on its behalf. There was no contradiction of this evidence.\nMr. Justice Archibald, who disposed of the appeal of the Alberta company at the same time as he dismissed the appeal of the Western company, did not mention the fact that it had been proven that the ownership of the shares was divided equally between the Alberta and the Saskatchewan companies and I think it is clear that he did not consider the effect that this had upon the issue in the appeal. His reasons merely stated that he dismissed the appeal of the Western company for the reasons given in his decision on the appeal of the Alberta company. The issue in that appeal, however, was different.\nUpon the undisputed evidence the facts accordingly are that during the taxation period in question the 5,000 issued shares of the Western company were owned one half by the Alberta and one half by the Saskatchewan company. The Western company was entitled to be taxed under the terms of ss. (1) of s. 36, unless it lost that benefit by reason of being \"related\" to one of the other companies, as that expression is defined by ss. (4) of s. 36. Neither the decision of the Minister nor of the Tax Appeal Board nor of Archibald J. mentioned to which corporation the Western company was related but, if I understand correctly the argument addressed to us on behalf of the Minister, the Crown's position is that it was related to both the Alberta and the Saskatchewan companies. Since, however, neither the Alberta nor the Saskatchewan company owned 70 per cent of all the issued common shares of the capital stock of the western company, para. (a) of ss. (4) cannot apply. As to para. (b) it is not suggested that 70 per cent of the issued common shares were owned by one person or by two or more persons jointly, so that if the Western company is to be deprived of the benefit of ss. (1) it must be under the terms of subpara. (iii) of para. (b). The expression \"persons\" include corporations under the definition of that term in s. 127(1)(ab) of the Act. If it be assumed that the Alberta and the Saskatchewan companies are persons not dealing with each other at arm's length, there still remains the fact that while each owned half of the shares of the Western company the Alberta company did not own any of the shares of the Saskatchewan company nor did the Saskatchewan company own any shares in the Alberta company. Accordingly, subpara. (iii) has no application. With respect, the reasons for the judgment of the Tax Appeal Board do not appear to me to touch the question to be decided. In my opinion, the Western company was entitled to be taxed under the provisions of ss. (1) of s. 36.\nThe appeal of the Alberta company raises a quite different issue. As has been shown above, H. R. Cohen and his brother-in-law Leshgold owned 90,000 of the 100,000 issued shares of the Alberta company and H. R. Cohen owned 100,000 of the shares of the Saskatchewan company. In addition to this, S. J. Cohen, a shareholder of the Alberta company, was the owner of 100,000 shares of the Saskat-chewan company and his son J. W. Cohen 50,000 shares. If, therefore, the Cohens and Leshgold were persons not dealing with each other at arm's length, the conditions of ubpara. (iii) are complied with and the two corporations are to be deemed related.\nFor the appellant it is said that the expression \"blood relationship\" is so vague and uncertain as to be incapable of interpretation. In support of this contention, the cases on the construction of the words \"relatives\" or \"relations\" in matters involving the interpretation of wills such as Ross v. Ross 3, In Re Lanyon 4, and Sifton v. Sifton 5, are relied upon. In Re Lanyon, the testator by his will provided that his trustees should stand possessed of his residuary estate upon trust to pay the income to his son for his life and on his decease upon trust to pay the capital to his children or grandchildren or equally between them if more than one, provided that his son did not marry a \"relation by blood.\" It was contended that the condition was void for uncertainty. Russell, J. by whom the matter was decided, considered that the meaning of \"blood relationship\" was clear and that it described the relationship existing between two or more persons Who stand in lawful descent from a common ancestor. He did not consider the provision in the will void for uncertainty but held it to be ineffective as being contrary to public policy as being a restraint upon marriage. In Sifton's case, Lord Romer who delivered the judgment of the Judicial Committee, after referring to the meaning attributed to the expression \"blood relation\" by Russell J., said that, in their Lordships' opinion, the condition might have been held to be void for uncertainty as, if the testator did not intend by the use of the expression to include the whole human race, he had failed to specify the number of generations in which no common ancestor of the spouses was to be found. I do not think that these decisions are of assistance in determining the present matter. The fact that there would undoubtedly be difficulty in determining the scope of the expression in some circumstances does not render the words meaningless. The question here to be determined is whether H. R. Cohen, S. J. Cohen and J. W. Cohen are connected by blood relationship. The three men are shown by the evidence to be descended from a common ancestor, the father of H. R. and S. J. Cohen. Accepting the meaning attributed to the expression by Russell J., which I think to be the correct one, these men are connected by blood relationship.\nThis does not, however, dispose of the matter since, while the three Cohens owned all of the shares in the Saskatchewan company, Leshgold owned 40 per cent of the shares in the Alberta company. Leshgold is married to a sister of H. R. and S. J. Cohen and the question is, therefore, Whether he is \"connected by marriage\" with them, within the meaning of the subparagraph. The matter is to be considered without reference to the amendment made to s. 127 by s. 31 of c. 29 of the Statutes of 1952, by which the expression was defined. Without overlooking the necessity for clarity in the language of a taxing statute, I am of the opinion that this language is sufficiently clear. One of the meanings assigned to the word \"connection\" in the New Oxford Dictionary is: relationship by family ties as marriage or distant consanguinity, and a second : a person who is connected by others by ties of any kind, especially a relative by marriage or distant consanguinity. In Webster's New International Dictionary, the word is similarly defined. In this sense, which I think to be the natural and ordinary meaning of the expression, Leshgold and the Cohen brothers were connections and so \"connected by marriage\", within the meaning of s. 127(5) (c). As Leshgold and H. R. Cohen between them owned 90 per cent of the shares of the Alberta company, the conditions of s. 36(4)(b)(iii) were complied with and the Alberta and Saskatchewan companies were \"related\" to each other, within the meaning of s. 36(3).\nIt is stated in the factum of the appellant that the Minister of National Revenue had of his own motion and without consulting the Alberta and Saskatchewan companies designated the latter as the corporation to be taxed under ss. (1) of s. 36. Subs. (3) provides that when two or more corporations are related to each other the tax payable by such one of them as may be agreed by them shall be computed under ss. 1 and that it is only where they cannot agree that the company to be so taxed may be designated by the Minister. We have no record of the proceedings before us in which the Minister is said to have made this direction. In the absence of any evidence on the point, I think we cannot be asked to assume that the Minister acted without evidence satisfactory to him that the parties could not agree which should receive this benefit, if only one was entitled to it.\nIn the result, the appeal of the Western company should be allowed with costs throughout and judgment entered declaring that, for the taxation period in question, that company was entitled to be taxed under the provisions of ss. (1) of s. 36. The appeal of the Alberta company should be dismissed with costs.\nEstey, J. (dissenting in part):\u2014There are here two appeals, one by Army & Navy Department Store Limited, an Alberta company (hereinafter referred to as the Alberta Corporation) and the Army & Navy Dept. Store (Western) Limited, a British Columbia company (hereinafter referred to as the Western Corporation). These companies, for the taxation years 1949 and 1950, along with the Army & Navy Department Store Limited, a Saskatchewan company (hereinafter referred to as the Saskatchewan Corporation), were taxed as related corporations. The first two corporations were taxed under s. 36(2) of The Income Tax Act (S. of C. 1948, 11-12 Geo. VI, c. 52), while the Minister designated that the Saskatchewan Corporation should be taxed under s. 36(3). All of the corporations filed their returns as unrelated or independent corporations.\nIt is agreed that the shares in these corporations are held as follows:\n(1) The Saskatchewan Corporation\u2014the shareholders are:\n40 per cent to S. J. Cohen\n20 per cent to J. W. Cohen (his son)\n40 per cent to H. R. Cohen (a brother of S. J. Cohen)\n(2) The Alberta Corporation\u2014the shareholders are:\n50 per cent to H. R. Cohen\n10 per cent to S. J. Cohen (his brother)\n40 per cent to S. D. Leshgold (brother-in-law of H. R. Cohen and S. J. Cohen) (3) The Western Corporation has 5,000 shares to the value of $10.00 each, divided as follows: shares\nto the Alberta Corporation\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 2,500\nto the Saskatchewan Corporation\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 2,498\nto H. R. Cohen\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 1\nto J. F. Bolecon\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 1\nThe shares in the name of H. R. Cohen and J. F. Bolecon in the Western Corporation are director's qualifying shares.\nSection 36 reads in part as follows:\n36. '(1) The tax payable by a corporation under this Part upon its taxable income or taxable income earned in Canada, as the case may be, (in this section referred to as the 'amount taxable') for a taxation year is, except where otherwise provided,\n(a) 15 per cent of the amount taxable if the amount taxable does not exceed $10,000, and\n(b) $1,500 plus 38 per cent of the amount by which the amount taxable exceeds $10,000, if the amount taxable exceeds $10,000.\n(2) Where two or more corporations are related to each other in a taxation year, the tax payable by each of them under this Part for the year is, except where otherwise provided by another section, 38 per cent of the amount taxable for the taxation year.\n(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), where two or more corporations are related to each other, the tax payable by such one of them as may be agreed by them or, if they cannot agree, as may be designated by the Minister shall be computed under subsection (1).\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026....\nThe term \"related corporations\" is defined in s. 36(4), as amended in 1951 and made applicable to 1949 and subsequent taxation years, as follows:\n36\u2026.\n(4) For the purpose of this section, one corporation is related to another in a taxation year if, at any time in the year,\n(a) one of them owned directly or indirectly 70 per cent or more of all the issued common shares of the capital stock of the other, or\n(b) 70 per cent or more of all the issued common shares of the capital stock of each of them is owned directly or indirectly by\n(i) one person,\n(ii) two or more persons jointly, or\n(iii) persons not dealing with each other at arms length one of whom owned directly or indirectly one or more of the shares of the capital stock of each of the corporations.\nThe phrase \"arms length\" is defined in s. 127(5) as follows:\n127\u2026.\nk (5) For the purposes of this Act,\n(a) a corporation and a person or one of several persons by whom it is directly or indirectly controlled, (b) corporations controlled directly or indirectly by the same person, or\n(c) persons connected by blood relationship, marriage or adoption, shall, without extending the meaning of the expression 'to deal with each other at arms length', be deemed not to deal with each other at arms length.\nThe appellants submit that as the word \"relationship\" or \"related\" is not defined in the statute at any time relevant hereto (it is defined subsequently, S. of C. 1952, c. 29, s. 31, ss. 2) that it ought to be construed as meaning the next of kin who would take in the event of intestacy. In their submission appellants' counsel adopted the statement of Chief Justice Strong in Ross v. Ross 6 :\nthe word 'relations' standing alone must be restricted to some particular class for if it were to be construed generally as meaning all relations it would be impossible ever to carry out the directions of the Will. The line, therefore, must be drawn somewhere and can only be drawn so as to exclude all persons whom the law in the case of an intestacy recognize as the proper class among whom to divide the property of a deceased person who dies intestate, namely his heirs.\nIn support of this contention he invokes the rule that where certain words have received a judicial interpretation Parliament, in subsequently adopting or using such words without any indication to the contrary, may be taken to have intended that they be used as so interpreted in the courts. Barlow v. Teal 7. The respondent points out that the statement of Chief Justice Strong was in relation to the interpretation of a will and that, while Parliament, in legislating in respect to the same or similar matters, might so intend, it does not apply where, as here, the subject matter of the legislation is in relation to income tax, a subject entirely different from that of wills. It is, however, unnecessary to decide this issue. Even if we assume that the word \"relationship\" means next of kin, these corporations are, within the meaning of the statute, related.\nIt will be observed that under s. 36(4)(b)(iii) there are two requirements: (a) at least 70 per cent of the issued common shares in each of the corporations shall be owned directly or indirectly by persons not dealing with each other at arms length; and (b) one of the persons must own at least one or more of the shares of the capital stock in each of the corporations. It would appear that under the terms of this section the Saskatchewan and Alberta Corporations are related. In the Saskatchewan Corporation H. R. Cohen and S. J. Cohen own 80 per cent of the shares of stock. These parties, H. R. Cohen and S. J. Cohen, are brothers and the former having no children his brother, S. J. Cohen, would come within those who would take if the former died intestate. In the Alberta Corporation H. R. Cohen and his brother-in-law S. D. Leshgold own 90 per cent of the stock and S. J. Cohen owns 10 per cent. In other words, the shares of the Alberta and Saskatchewan Corporations are owned by persons who are \"connected by blood relationship or marriage\" within the meaning of s. 127(5)(c). The further requirement of s. 36(4)(b)(iii) is found in the fact that H. R. Cohen owns \"one or more of the shares of the : capital stock of each of the corporations.\" It follows that the Alberta and Saskatchewan Corporations are related within the meaning of s. 36(4)(b)(iii).\nIn the Western Corporation the shares are held as follows :\nshares\nAlberta Corporation\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.. 2,500\nSaskatchewan Corporation\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 2,498\nH.

The issue here raised is that of direct or indirect ownership of the shares in the Western Corporation. That the Alberta and Saskatchewan Corporations own all the shares in the Western Corporation does not necessarily conclude the matter in determining whether these corporations are related within the meaning of the statute. These corporations are artificial bodies that act as directed by individuals. H. R. and S. J. Cohen and S. D. Leshgold are owners of all the shares in the Alberta Corporation and all but 20 per cent (owned by J. W. Cohen, a son of S.J. Cohen) in the Saskatchewan Corporation.\nWhile the appellants emphasize that s. 36(4)(b)(iii) deals with ownership of shares, it should be observed that it is ownership \"directly or indirectly\" on the part of persons not dealing at arms length. The dictionary defines \"indirectly\" as circuitous or roundabout. Parliament, by the inclusion of the word \"indirectly\" in this context, evidenced a clear intention that the share position of a corporation should be so far examined as to ascertain who, in fact, are the owners who effectually exercise the powers of ownership. It is :a provision in respect of which the language of Wills J. is appropriate:\n\u2026 especially in revenue matters, it seems to me that one ought to look at the substance, and not merely at matters of machinery and form;\nThe St. Louis Breweries Limited v. Apthorpe 8.\nWhen one examines this situation as suggested by Wills J., the conclusion cannot be avoided that, while directly the Saskatchewan and Alberta Corporations own the Western Corporation, H. R. and S. J. Cohen and S. D. Leshgold are the indirect owners of 70 per cent or more of all the issued common shares of the capital stock and are persons not dealing at arms length within the meaning of s. 36(4)(b(iii). It would seem that Parliament, by the inclusion of the word \"indirectly\" in s. 36(4)(b)(iii) intended to provide for just such situations as here created by the three parties H. R. and S. J. Cohen and S. D. Leshgold.\nThen the other requirement of s. 36(4) (b) is satisfied by the fact that H. R. Cohen owns at least one share in each of these corporations. The evidence discloses that his share in the Western Corporation is held in trust for the Saskatchewan Corporation. It is described in the evidence as a share given to him in order that he might serve in the capacity as a director and, therefore, one who must act at the instance of the Saskatchewan Corporation, which, in fact, means that he will act at the instance of himself and S. J. Cohen who own 80 per cent of that Corporation. The fact that he has not the beneficial interest in that one share is not, under the circumstances of this case, sufficient to take him out of the provisions of s. 36(4)(b)(iii).\nAll of these corporations filed their income tax returns as if they were unrelated or independent corporations and the Minister has designated the Saskatchewan Corporation as the one that might be taxed under s. 36(3), which provides:\n36. (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), where two or more corporations are related to each other, the tax payable by such one of them as may be agreed by them or, if they cannot agree, as may be designated by the Minister shall be computed under subsection (1).\nIt is here contended that, inasmuch as there is no evidence that the parties could not agree, the Minister had no authority to make such a designation. Such an issue \u25a0 might well be raised by the Saskatchewan Corporation, which, however, has not taken an appeal from the Minister's decision. It cannot appropriately be raised by either of the appellants in the appeals here taken, particularly as it is not contended that either of these appellants (Alberta and Western Corporations) should have been so designated.\nThe appeals should be dismissed.\nCartwright J.:\u2014These appeals were argued together. The facts out of which they arise and the relevant statutory provisions are fully set out in the reasons of other members of the Court and I shall repeat them only so far as may be necessary to indicate the reasons for the conclusion at which I have arrived.\nFor the reasons given by my brother Locke I agree that the appeal of the Alberta Company should be dismissed.\nTurning to the appeal of the Western Company, the question is whether it is related to either the Alberta Company or the Saskatchewan Company. The notion of one company being related to another is the creation of statute and whether or not the appellant is so related must be ascertained by applying the words of the statute to the facts. To establish the relationship it must appear that two conditions co-existed during the taxation year, (a) that as to both the appellant company and the company to which it is said to be related 70 per cent or more of all its issued common shares was owned directly or indirectly by persons not dealing with each other at arms length, and (b) that one of such persons owned directly or indirectly one or more of the shares of each of the companies. Dealing first with condition (a), I agree, for the reasons stated by my brother Locke, that it is established in the case of both the Alberta Company and the Saskatchewan Company that 70 per cent or more of its issued common shares was owned directly by persons not dealing with each other at arms length (viz. in the Alberta Company by H. R. Cohen, S. J. Cohen and S. D. Leshgold and in the Saskatchewan Company by H. R. Cohen, S. J. Cohen and J. W. Cohen). Can the same be said of the appellant company? For the respondent two alternative submissions are made.\nFirst, it is said that the Alberta Company and the Saskatchewan Company own more than 70 per cent of all the issued shares of the appellant company and that they are persons not dealing with each other at arms length as they are both controlled by the same two individuals, H. R. Cohen and S. J. Cohen, whose total holdings amount to 60 per cent of the issued shares of the Alberta Company and 80 per cent of the issued shares of the Saskatchewan Company. If the statute were silent as to the circumstances in which corporations shall be deemed not to deal with each other at arms length this submission would have great force, but when section 127 by clause (b) provides that corporations controlled directly or indirectly by the same person shall be deemed not to deal with each other at arms length it appears to me to negative the view that corporations are to be deemed not to deal with each other at arms length When controlled not by the same person but by the same group of persons. Expressio unius exclusio alterius. When the wording of clause (b) of section 127 is contrasted with that of clause (a) it seems to me impossible to read the word \"person\" in clause (b) as including the plural. While the Alberta Company and the Saskatchewan Company may well be said to be controlled by the same persons they are not controlled by the same person and in my opinion they can not on this ground be deemed for the purposes of the Act not to deal with each other at arms length.\nSecondly, and alternatively, it is said that more than 70 per cent of the shares of the Western Company while owned directly by the Alberta Company and the Saskatchewan Company are owned indirectly by the shareholders of the two last mentioned companies H. R. Cohen, S. J. Cohen, S. D. Leshgold and J. M. Cohen who, as shewn in the reasons of my brother Locke, are persons not dealing with each other at arms length. With the greatest respect for those who hold the contrary view, I do not think that shareholders, either individually or collectively, have any owner-ship direct or indirect in the property of the company in which they hold shares. In Macaura v. Northern Assurance Company 9, Lord Buckmaster said:\u2014\n\u2026 Now, no shareholder has any right to any item of property owned by the company, for he has no legal or equitable interest therein. He is entitled to a share in the profits while the company continues to carry on business and a share in the distribution of the surplus assets when the company is wound up.\nand at page 633 of the same report, Lord Wrenbury points out that even a shareholder who holds all the shares in a corporation \"has no property legal or equitable in the assets of the corporation.\"\nIn Salomon v. Salomon and Company 10, Lord Macnaghten says at page 51:\u2014\n\u2026 the company is not in law the agent of the subscribers or trustee for them.\nIn my respectful opinion these passages correctly state the law.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the existence of condition (a) mentioned above has not been established in regard to the Western Company and this is sufficient to dispose of the appeal in its favour; I wish, however, to say a few words as to condition (b).\nIf the argument of the respondent, that all the shares of the Western Company were owned indirectly by the three Cohens and Leshgold, had prevailed, it might have been said that H. R. Cohen and S. J. Cohen, who admittedly own directly shares in both the Alberta and Saskatchewan Companies, fulfilled the requirement of section 36(4)(b)(iii) by owning indirectly one or more of the shares of the Western Company, although there would have been manifest difficulty in identifying any share or shares of the last mentioned company as being owned by either of them. However, this point was not pressed by the respondent who relied on the fact that one share of the Western Company was registered in the name of H. R. Cohen. If, then, the Alberta Company and the Saskatchewan Company are regarded, as I think they must be, as the owners of at least 4998 of the 5,000 issued shares of the Western Company but, contrary to the view I have expressed above, should be deemed to be persons not dealing with each other at arms length, then I would agree with my brother Locke that it has been shown that H. R. Cohen did not own any share of the capital stock of the Western Company. It is argued for the respondent that even if the Saskatchewan Company is the beneficial owner of the share registered in the name of H. R. Cohen, the latter is its \"direct owner\" but in my view on the evidence he had no ownership either direct or indirect in this share. The Companies Act of British Columbia, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 58, does not require that a director shall be the owner in his own right of a share in the company but only that his qualification shall be \"the holding of at least one share in the company\" and by section 90 a certificate is made only prima facie evidence of title. In the case at bar the evidence establishes that the share registered in H. R. Cohen's name was the sole property of the Saskatchewan Company. Mr. Cohen could not even have given title by estoppel to a purchaser in good faith and without notice as he did not have the certificate in his possesion but had endorsed it and delivered it to the solicitor of the Saskatchewan Company to hold for it and not for him. I conclude therefore that the existence of condition (b), mentioned above, was negatived.\nFor the above reasons I would dispose of both appeals as proposed by my brother Locke.\nAppeal of the Western company allowed with costs; appeal of the Alberta company dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Grossman & Sharp.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

And Estey, Locke, Cartwright And Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nSuccession\u2014Effect of will giving income from residue with power to draw from capital\u2014Whether general power of appointment\u2014Whether dutiable succession\u2014Dominion Succession Duty Act , 4 and 5 Geo. VI, c. 4, ss. 4(1), 31.\nBy her will the testatrix left her estate to her trustees to pay to her husband during his lifetime the income from the residue and \"in addition thereto to pay to my said husband from time to time and at any time such portion of the capital of my estate as he may wish or require and upon his simple demand, my said husband to be the sole judge as to the amount of capital to be withdrawn by him and the times and manner of withdrawing the same, and neither my said husband nor my executors and trustees shall be obliged to account further for any capital sums so paid to my said husband\". Upon the death of the husband, the trustees were to dispose of what was left of the capital among designated legatees. The minister took the position that the will conferred a general power of appointment upon the husband over the residue of the estate and that consequently he became by virtue of s. 31 of the Dominion Succession Duty Act liable to duty on the same basis as if the residue had been abolutely bequeathed to him. The Minister's assessment was upheld by the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nHeld: (Rinfret C.J. and Locke J. dissenting), that the appeal should be allowed and the assessment set aside; the dutiable value of the succession to the husband in respect of the residuary estate of the testatrix was the value as of the date of her death of the estimated net revenues from such residuary estate and the residuary legatees were assessable as having on the death of the testatrix become beneficially entitled to the capital of the residue in remainder expectant upon the death of the husband, subject to the appropriate adjustment due to his having received a certain amount from the capital.\nPer Estey J.: Assuming that the testatrix created a general power of appointment, it would still appear that no duty upon or in respect to a succession can be imposed to her husband except as to what he has already received from the capital. The giving of a general power of appointment at common law did not of itself constitute a disposition of property. The Succession Duty Act does not provide that it constitute a \"disposition of property\", that is to say, a succession as defined in s. 2(m). It is not included under s. 3(1) which defines those dispositions of property which should be deemed a succession. S. 31 does not contain language that would constitute such a power a disposition of the property. On the contrary, 'Parliament, in that section, would appear to have accepted the common law in relation to dispositions under a general power. Throughout s. 31, there are no words appropriate to the imposition of a levy that would justify a conclusion that this is a charging section.\nPer Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: The testatrix's husband was not given the power to appoint the capital by will; and even on the assumption that he was given a general power to appoint the capital inter vivos, there is no provision in the statute to support the claim that he was liable to pay succession duty in respect of that part of the residuary estate which he did not receive and which upon his death passed under the will of the testatrix to the residuary legatees. S. 31 of the Act does not purport to levy any duty or to create or define a succession. It provides only for the manner and time of payment of duty which is assumed to be levied by other provisions. Applying the words of s. 2(m) of the Act, the husband did not become beneficially entitled to the capital of the estate. A person who is given a power over property does not thereby become beneficially entitled to such property. In the present case, the residuary legatees immediately on the death of the testatrix took not a contingent but a vested remainder in the capital, expectant on the death of the husband, subject to be divested in whole or in part by his exercise of the power to take during his lifetime such portions of the capital as he might wish. So far as the capital of the residue was concerned no part of it became vested in him upon the death of the testatrix or under any disposition made by her. Per Rinfret C.J. (dissenting) : The right given to the husband to draw the capital was a general power to appoint equivalent to a bequest of the whole property of the testatrix to her husband and s. 31 of the Act covers a situation of that kind. It might even be said that within the definition of s. 2(m), the husband succeeded to the whole of the property of his wife.\nPer Locke J. (dissenting) : The right which accrued to the testatrix's husband upon her death to require the trustees of the estate at any time to pay to him the whole or any part of the capital of the estate, made him competent to dispose of the capital of his wife's estate (Re Penrose [1953] 1 Ch. 793: Re Parsons [1942] 2 A.E.R. 496); it therefore gave him a beneficial interest in the property and this disposition by the will was a succession within the meaning of s. 2(m) of the Act. Furthermore, the will gave to the husband a general power of appointment within the meaning of s. 4(1) and s. 31 (Re Richards [1902] 1 Ch. 76: Re Ryder [1914] 1 Ch. 865: 25 Halsbury 516); consequently, under s. 31, the liability for duty attached as if the capital of the estate over which the power had been given had been the subject of the bequest.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Saint-Pierre, Acting Judge 1, upholding the Minister's assessment.\nJ. E. Mitchell Q.C. for the appellants.\nC. A. Geoffrion and R. G. Decary for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting): I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nThe will of Mrs. Maud Angus Chipman, wife of Dr. Walter Chipman, contained the following clause:\u2014\n(f) To pay to my husband, the said Walter William Chipman, during the remainder of his lifetime, the net interest and revenues from the residue of my Estate and in addition thereto to pay to my said husband from time to time and at any time such portions of the capital of my Estate as he may wish or require and upon his simple demand, my said husband to be the sole judge as to the amount of capital to be withdrawn by him and the times and manner of withdrawing the same, and neither my said husband nor my Executors and Trustees shall be obliged to account further for any capital sums so paid to my said husband.\nBy Notice of Assessment for Succession Duties purposes Dr. Chipman was treated as if the property itself had been given to him, in view of the general power to appoint given to him in Clause (f). The effect of that clause was to put Dr. Chipman in the position of succeeding to the whole of the estate at his option and upon his sole demand.\nOn appeal it was submitted that the right given to Dr. Chipman to draw capital was not a general power to appoint within the meaning of section 31 of the Act; and even if the right so given was a general power to appoint within the meaning of Section 31 the construction of that Section adopted by the Exchequer Court 2 was erroneous and not in accord with the context in which it is found ; and, further, on the true construction of that Section the purpose of the Section is simply to regulate in a particular case the manner and time of payment of duties levied in respect of successions determined by other sections of the Act. The appellant submitted that Section 31 does not affect in any way the incidence of duties or purport to create any new succession.\nThe learned Judge of the Exchequer Court (Saint Pierre J.) 3 decided contrary to the submission of the appellant. He held that section 31 had to be read in conjunction with section 4(1), which reads as follows:\u2014\n4. (1) A person shall be deemed competent to dispose of property if he has such an estate or interest therein, or such general power as would, if he were sui juris, enable him to dispose of the property and the expression 'general power' includes every power or authority enabling the donee or other holder thereof to appoint or dispose of property as he thinks fit. whether exercisable by instrument intervivos or by will, or both, but exclusive of any power exercisable in a fiduciary capacity under a disposition not made by himself, or exercisable as mortgagee.\nHe held that in the present case Dr. Chipman received from his wife the general power by which the Executors of the Estate would pay him from time to time and at any time such portions of the capital of the Estate as he might wish or require and upon his simple demand, he being the sole judge as to the amount of capital to be withdrawn by him and the times and manner of withdrawing the same, without he or the Executors and Trustees being obliged to account for any capital sums so paid to him.\nIn my view this is the equivalent of a bequest of the whole property of the deceased to her husband and Section 31 of The Dominion Succession Duty Act duly covers a situation of that kind. In the words of O'Connor J. in Cossit v. Minister of National Revenue 4 :\nThere was a succession within section 31 . And under section 31 , the duty levied in respect of such succession is payable in the same manner and at the same time as if the property itself had been given to the appellant.\n(In the present case, Dr. Chipman). It might even be said that within the definition of section 2(m) of the Act, Dr. Chipman succeeded to the whole of the property of his wife.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nEstey, J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment in the Exchequer Court 5 affirming the assessment made in the estate of Maud Mary Angus Chipman by the respondent under the Dominion Succession Duty Act (S. of C. 1940-41, 4-5 Geo. VI, c. 14).\nThe textatrix, Maud Mary Angus Chipman, died January 14, 1946, leaving an estate of a net aggregate value of $1,001,627.96. In computation of the succession duty the parties disagree as to the construction of clause 3(f) in the will.\n3 (f) To pay to my husband, the said Walter William Chipman, during the remainder of his lifetime, the net interest and revenues from the residue of my Estate and in addition thereto to pay to my said husband from time to time and at any time such portions of the capital of my Estate as he may wish or require and upon his simple demand, my said husband to be the sole judge as to the amount of capital to be withdrawn by him and the times and manner of withdrawing the same, and neither my said husband nor my Executors and Trustees shall be obliged to account further for any capital sums so paid to my said husband.\nIt is also important to observe that in clause 3(g) the testatrix provided that\nUpon the death of my said husband or upon my death should he have predeceased me to dispose of my Estate as it may then exist \u2026\nThen followed a number of specific directions under which she disposed of the entire estate. Doctor Chipman died on April 4, 1950, and at that time had received capital under the exercise of his power in clause 3(f) in the sum of $33,164.41.\nThere is no dispute as to the amount of the duty relative to the interest and revenues given to the husband Doctor Chipman in the first part of clause 3(f). The controversy is with respect to the construction of the latter portion which the respondent has construed as a general power to appoint and, as a consequence, has levied the succession duty in the same manner as if the property had been bequeathed absolutely to Doctor Chipman. There is much to be said in principle for the contention that a power of appointment that permits one to appoint only to himself is not a general power of appointment. However, it seems unnecessary to decide that point as, even if we assume, for the purpose of this decision, that the testatrix, in clause 3(f), has created a general power of appointment, it would still appear that respondent, within the meaning of the statute, cannot impose a duty upon or in respect to a succession to Doctor Chipman except as to the sum of $33,164.41.\nThe statute imposes a duty upon and in respect of a succession (ss. 6, 10 and 11). A succession is defined in s. 2(m):\n2 (m) 'succession' means every past or future disposition of property, by reason whereof any person has or shall become beneficially entitled to any property or the income thereof upon the death of any deceased person, either immediately or after any interval, either certainly or contingently, and either originally or by way of substitutive limitation, and every devolution by law of any beneficial interest in property, or the income thereof, upon the death of any such deceased person, to any other person in possession or expectancy, and also includes any disposition of property deemed by this Act to be included in a succession;\nThe giving of a general power of appointment at common law did not of itself constitute a disposition of property.\nA Common Law Power enables the donee to pass the legal estate; but it is the execution, not the creation of the power, which effects the transmutation of estate. The legal estate before the execution remains in the creator of the power, or his grantee, or heir-at-law, as the case may be.\nFarwell on Powers, 3rd Ed., p. 2.\nWhen the donee exercised the power the beneficiaries took by virtue of the instrument creating the power, but not by virtue of the exercise thereof. Attorney-General v. Parker 6; Re Lovelace 7.\nThe testatrix, in the foregoing clause (3(f), under the common law made a disposition by which the legal estate passed to the executors subject to Doctor Chipman's power and then, upon his death, the executors would dispose of the estate, \"as it may then exist,\" as directed in the will. He, as and when and to the extent that he exercised his power, became owner of the capital by virtue of the provisions of the will of the testatrix. The law in the Province of Quebec would appear to be to the same effect and, indeed, this appeal has been presented upon that basis.\nThe contention of the Crown could only be maintained if the Succession Duty Act had provided that the giving of a general power of appointment constituted a \"disposition of property\" and, therefore, a succession as defined in s. (2m). It may first of all be pointed out that the giving of a general power of appointment is not included under s. 3(1), which defines those dispositions of property which should be deemed a succession.\nThe provisions of s. 4 would be relevant if we were considering Doctor Chipman's estate, but do not appear to be of assistance in considering that of the testatrix.\nThe Crown relied particularly upon the provisions of s. 31 :\u2014\n31. Where a general power to appoint any property either by instrument inter vivos, or by will, or both, is given to any person, the duty levied in respect of the succession thereto shall be payable in the same manner and at the same time as if the property itself had been given, devised or bequeathed, to the person to whom such power is given.\nThis section specifically refers to \"the duty levied in respect of the succession thereto\" (the word \"thereto\" referring back to the word \"property\"). It does not contain language that would constitute a general power a disposition of the property. On the contrary, Parliament, in this section, would appear to have accepted the common law in relation to dispositions under a general power. Indeed, throughout the section there are no words appropriate to the imposition of a levy that would justify a conclusion that this is a charging section. In any event, in the latter part the language assumes a levy has been made and provides how the same shall be payable.\nCounsel for the respondent argued that the word \"manner\" in the foregoing section should be read as meaning \"amount,\" or some other word that would support a conclusion that this section imposed a levy. The word \"amount,\" or whatever other word might be inserted, would not change the effect of the word \"payable,\" which is not an appropriate word of imposition or charge. It rather assumes the existence of a charge. In order that counsel's submission might be accepted, the section would have to be reworded to include some such language as \"The duty shall be levied in the same manner and payable at the same time as if the property itself had been given.\" This would, in effect, be to legislate rather than construe and, therefore, beyond the function of a court. As Lord Macmillan stated in Altrincham Electric Supply Limited v. Sale Urban District Council 8:\nA court may construe the language of an Act of Parliament but may not distort it to make it accord with what the court thinks to be reasonable.\nThe submission that, unless the phrase \"in the same manner\" is construed as counsel for respondent suggests, it would be equivalent to or synonymous with \"at the same time\" and, therefore, surplus cannot be maintained. It would rather appear that each of these phrases as used in s. 31 possesses a separate and independent meaning and purpose. The phrase \"in the same manner\" has reference to such items as interest (s. 25), security (s. 26), extensions of time for payment and other like matters dealt with in other sections of the statute. This view finds support from the use of the word \"manner\" in s. 28(3) where it appears: \"\u2026 may be paid \u2026 in the manner provided by\" s. 28(4) or 28(. The former has regard to the consequences of non-payment under s. 24 and the latter provides: \"\u2026 the duty levied \u2026 if not sooner paid, shall be paid in four equal instalments \u2026\" It would, therefore, appear that the section as drafted does not support respondent's view.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the judgment in ' the Exchequer Court set aside and the matter referred back to the Minister for a reassessment on the basis that upon the death of the testatrix the capital in the residue of her estate passed to the parties named in the will, subject to the amount received by Doctor Chipman in the sum of $33,164.41. The appellants are entitled to their costs both in the Exchequer Court and in this Court.\nLocke, J. (dissenting):\u2014 The will of the late Maude Angus Chipman, after bequeathing the whole of her property to trustees, one of whom was her husband Dr. W. W. Chipman, and directing the payment of her debts and making certain specific bequests, directed the said trustees, inter alia:\u2014\nTo pay to my husband, the said Walter William Chipman, during the remainder of his lifetime, the net interest and revenues from the residue of my estate and in addition thereto to pay to my said husband from time to time and at any time such portions of the capital of my estate as he may wish or require and upon his simple demand, my said husband to be the sole judge as to the amount of capital to be withdrawn by him and the times and manner of withdrawing the same, and neither my said husband nor my executors and trustees shall be obliged to account further for any capital sums so paid to my said husband.\nUpon the death of the husband, the \"will provided that the estate, as it might then exist, shall be disposed of among designated legatees.\nSubsection (m) of section 2 of the Dominion Succession Duty Act defines a succession. So far as it affects the present matter, the definition reads:\u2014\n'Succession' means every past or future disposition of property, by reason whereof any person has or shall become beneficially entitled to any property or the income thereof upon the death of any deceased person, either immediately or after any interval either certainly or contingently.\nThe language of the subsection is taken, almost without change, from s. 2 of the Succession Duty Act 1853 (Imp. 16-17 Vict. c. 51). There was, however, added at the conclusion of ss. (m) the words:\u2014\nand also includes any disposition of property deemed by this Act to be included in a succession.\n\"Successor\", as in the English Act, is defined as meaning the person entitled under a succession.\nSs. 1 of s. 4 of the Dominion Act reproduces, with a change which does not affect the present question, ss. 2(a). of s. 22 of the Finance Act 1894 (Imp. 57-58 Vict. cap. 30) and reads:\u2014\nA person shall be deemed competent to dispose of property if he has such ah estate or interest therein or such general power as would, if he were sui juris, enable him to dispose of the property and the expression 'general power' includes every power or authority enabling the donee or other holder thereof to appoint or dispose of property as he thinks fit, whether exercisable by instrument, inter vivos or by will, or both, but exclusive of any power exercisable in a fiduciary capacity under a disposition not made by himself, or exercisable as mortgagee.\nSection 6 provides that, subject to the exemptions mentioned in s. 7, there shall be assesed, levied and paid at the rates provided for in the first schedule to the Act, duties upon or in respect of the following successions, that is to say, where the deceased was at the time of his death domiciled in a province of Canada upon or in respect of the succession to all real or immovable property situated in I Canada and all personal property wheresoever situated.\nThe charging provisions are in Part III of the Act and prescribe the rates of duty to be paid in respect of each succession mentioned in s. 6 and define the persons liable for payment. Section 12 included in this part imposes upon every successor liability for the duty levied upon or in respect of the succession to him.\nSection 31 of the Act is included in Part V with other sections under the heading \"Payment of Duties\" and reads:\u2014\nWhere a general power to appoint any property either by instrument inter vivos, or by will, or both, is given to any person, the duty levied in respect of the succession thereto shall be payable in the same manner and at the same time as if the property itself had been given, devised or bequeathed, to the person to whom such power is given.\nWhen the Succession Duty Act 1853 was passed, s. 4, with a marginal note which read: \"General Powers of Appointment to Confer Successions\", provided that where a person was given a general power of appointment over property under any disposition of property taking effect upon the death of any person dying after the time appointed for the commencement of the Act, he should:\u2014\nin the event of his making any Appointment thereunder, be deemed to be entitled, at the Time of his exercising such Power, to the Property or Interest thereby appointed as a Succession derived from the Donor of the Power.\nSection 18 of the Finance Act 1894 provided that the value for the purpose of succession duty of a succession to real property arising upon the death of the deceased person should, where the successor is competent to dispose of the property, be the principal value of the property after deducting the estate duty payable in respect thereof on the said death.\nSection 4 of the Act of 1853 was not adopted in the Canadian Act. The question as to whether the right which accrued to Dr. Chipman upon the death of his wife to require the trustees of the estate at any time to pay to him the whole or any part of the capital of the estate was a general power to appoint such property, within the meaning of ss. (1) of s. 4 and s. 31 , and whether this constituteda succession, within the meaning of ss. (m) of s. 2, must depend upon the interpretation to be given to the language of these sections.\nBy s. 3(1) (i) a succession includes the disposition of property of which the person dying was at the time of his death competent to dispose and the beneficiary of such a disposition is deemed to be a successor. Dr. Chipman was competent to dispose of the capital of his wife's estate, after providing for the debts and the specific legacies within the meaning of s. 3(i) (i) and s. 4(1) (In Re Penrose 9 : Re Parsons 10. As pointed out by Lord Greene, M.R. in Parson's case, the phrase \"competent to dispose\" is not a phrase of art and, taken by itself and quite apart from the definition clause in the Act, conveys the ability to dispose, including the ability to make a thing your own. In my opinion, this right vested in Dr. Chipman by his wife's will gave him a beneficial interest in the property and this disposition by the will was a succession, within the meaning of ss. (m) of s. 2.\nI am further of the opinion that the disposition gave to Dr. Chipman a general power of appointment, within the meaning of ss. (1) of s. 4 and s. 31 .\nIn Re Richards 11, where, by a will, the income of the estate was bequeathed to the wife of the testator for life with a direction that, in case such income should not be sufficient, she might use such portion of the capital as she might deem expedient, Farwell J. held that the wife had a general power of appointment over the capital during her life. This statement of the law was adopted by Warrington J. in Re Ryder 12, and in Halsbury's Article on Powers, vol. 25, p. 516.\nUnder s. 4 of the Act of 1853 the liability for succession duty would attach only when and as the donee exercised the power of appointment. Section 31 of the Canadian Act, however, provides that where a general power to appoint any property is given to any person by will, the duty levied in respect of the succession thereto shall be payable in the same manner and at the same time as if the property itself had been bequeathed to the person to whom the power is given. The section is not restricted to fixing the time of payment of the duties. The words \"in the same manner\" must, in my opinion, be construed as meaning that the liability for duty attaches as it would if the capital of the estate over which the power is given were the subject of the bequest.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nCartwright J.:\u2014The questions raised on this appeal are as to the duties payable under The Dominion Succession Duty Act upon the death of the late Maud Mary Angus Chipman (hereinafter referred to as Mrs. Chipman) in respect of successions to her residuary estate.\nMrs. Chipman died, domiciled in the City of Montreal, on January 14, 1946, leaving a will and codicil made in notarial form dated respectively February 7, 1940 and May 26, 1943.\nThe will recites that Mrs. Chipman is the wife, separate as to property, of Dr. Walter William Chipman, (hereinafter referred to as Dr. Chipman) and by clause \"Thirdly\" gives the whole of her estate to her executors and trustees in trust:\u2014\n(a) To pay all my just debts, funeral and testamentary expenses as soon as possible after my death and to pay all succession- duties, inheritance taxes, court fees and similar taxation on my Estate out of the capital of the residue of my Estate without charging same to my respective legatees and without the intervention) of any of my legatees.\n(b) is a bequest to a niece;\n(c) and (d) give the use of her residence and its contents to Dr. Chipman for his lifetime;\n(e) is a legacy to employees.\nThe will continues:\u2014\n(f) To pay to my husband, the said Walter William Chipman, during the remainder of his lifetime, the net interest and revenues from the residue of my Estate and in addition thereto to pay to my said husband from time to time and at any time such portions of the capital of my Estate as he may wish or require and upon his simple demand, my said husband to be the sole judge as to the amount of capital to be withdrawn by him and the times and manner of withdrawing the same, and neither my said husband nor my Executors and Trustees shall be obliged to account further for any capital sums so paid to my said husband. (g) Upon the death of my said husband or upon my death should he have predeceased me to dispose of my Estate as it may then exist as follows, namely:\u2014\n1. My jewellery, pictures, household furniture and household effects shall be disposed of in accordance with any memorandum I may leave with respect to the same and failing any such memorandum then the same shall be divided among my residuary legatees hereinafter named in the same manner as the residue of my Estate.\n2. To pay to The Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning (McGill University), of Montreal, the sum of fifty thousand dollars as a special legacy.\n3. To pay to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, the sum of fifty thousand dollars as a special legacy.\n4. To pay to The Art Gallery, presently situate at the corner of Ontario Avenue and Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, the sum of fifty thousand dollars as a special legacy.\n5. To pay to The Church of St. Andrew and St. Paul, presently on Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, the sum of Twenty-five thousand dollars.\nThe receipt of the treasurer for the time being of each of the foregoing institutions shall be a good and valid discharge to my Executors and Trustees.\n6. To divide the capital of the residue of my Estate between my brothers, sisters, niece and nephews as follows:\u2014 One-sixth thereto to my brother, D. Forbes Angus, of the City of Montreal; one-sixth thereof to my brother William Forrest Angus of the City of Montreal; one-sixth thereof to my brother, David James Angus, presently of Victoria, British Columbia; one-sixth thereof to my sister, Margaret Angus, wife of Dr. Charles Ferdinand Martin, of the City of Montreal; one-sixth thereof to my sister, Dame Bertha Angus, widow of Robert MacDougall Paterson of the City of Montreal; one-eighteenth thereof to my niece, Gyneth Wanklyn, widow of Durie McLennan, of the City of Montreal; one-eighteenth thereof to my nephew, David A. Wanklyn, of the City of Montreal; and one-eighteenth thereof to my nephew, Frederick A. Wanklyn, presently of Nassau, Bahamas; and I hereby constitute my said brothers, sisters, niece and nephews any universal residuary legatees in the aforesaid proportions.\nThe will then provides for the possibilities of brothers, sisters, nephews or the niece of the testatrix predeceasing her and defines the powers of the executors and trustees. The only provision of the will or codicil other than those quoted above which it is suggested may have relevance to the inquiry before us is the clause entitled \"Fifthly\", reading as follows:\u2014\nThe bequests herein made whether of capital or revenue are intended as an alimentary provision for my legatees and shall be exempt from seizure for their debts except as a result of express hypothecation or pledge. I direct, moreover, that the bequests herein made while in the hands of my Executors and Trustees shall not be capable of being assigned by the beneficiaries. Dr. Chipman died on April 4, 1950, domiciled in the City of Montreal. During his lifetime pursuant to the terms of Clause 3(f), quoted above, he demanded and received payment of $33,164.41 out of the capital of the residue of the estate.\nIn these circumstances the learned trial judge 13 has, held affirming the assessment made by the Minister that under Mrs. Chipman's will a general power of appointment over the capital of the residue was given to Dr. Chipman and that duties should be assessed as if the capital of the residue had been given outright to him. The contention of the appellants, made when Dr. Chipman was still alive, was:\u2014\nthat the assessment should be revised on the basis of assessing Dr. Chipman as revenue beneficiary only and assessing the residuary legatees as capital beneficiaries, a suitable reserve being made in the assessment for reviewing the same in the event Dr. Chipman should withdraw capital.\nTheir submission on this appeal is the same, subject to the modification made necessary by the fact that the amount of capital withdrawn by Dr. Chipman has now been reduced to a certainty.\nThe first question is as to the proper construction of the relevant clauses of the will. Under the rules of the law of Quebec, which do not appear to differ in this regard from those of the common law, it seems clear that Dr. Chipman was entitled to the income from the residue for life and that on his death the capital was divisible among the residuary legatees, pursuant to clause 3(g) of the will, subject to the possibility of part or all of the capital having been paid to Dr. Chipman during his lifetime; and the shares received by the residuary legatees passed to them from Mrs. Chip-man and not from Dr. Chipman. The provisions of the Dominion Succession Duty Act do not purport to alter this result, but in the submission of the respondent they have the effect of providing that duties shall be levied as if (i) the whole residue had been given outright to Dr. Chipman by the will of Mrs. Chipman, and (ii) the shares of Mrs. Chipman's estate received by the residuary legatees on Dr. Chipman's death had passed to them from him and not from her. It is with the first only of these two questions that we are directly concerned on this appeal. The power of Parliament to so provide is not challenged: the question is whether on a proper construction of the Statute it has done so.\nFor the appellants it is argued that clause 3(f) of the will does not give Dr. Chipman any general power of appointment over the capital of the residue. In my opinion no power to appoint any part of the capital of the residue by will was given to Dr. Chipman. The clause contemplates the exercise of judgment by him as to the amount or amounts that he wishes to take from capital and payment thereof to him in his lifetime. It is payment to him that relieves the executors from further liability to account. Under clause (g), upon his death, the capital \"as it may then exist\" falls to be divided under the terms of Mrs. Chipman's will. Be this as it may, counsel for the respondent contends that during Dr. Chipman's lifetime his power is unlimited as to the amounts that he may take, that the obligation of the executors is to pay to him from time to time and at any time, upon his simple demand, such portions of the capital as he may wish or require, and that consequently Dr. Chipman was given a general power to appoint inter vivos. If it were necessary to decide this question, careful consideration would first have to be given to the appellant's argument that the wide terms in which the power given to Dr. Chipman is expressed in clause 3(f) are modified and restricted by clause \"Fifthly\", quoted above. Even if the respondent's contention that Dr. Chip-man was entitled to take the whole capital be accepted, the power given to him does not at first sight appear to fall within the text-book definitions of a general power. See, for example, Halsbury 2nd Edition, Vol. 25 at page 211 :\u2014\nA general power is such as the donee can exercise in favour of such person or persons as he pleases, including himself or his executors or administrators.\nWe were, however, referred to the following three cases, in which powers similar to that given to Dr. Chipman were held to be general powers to appoint inter vivos: Re Richards, Uglow v. Richards 14, a decision of Farwell J.; In re Ryder, Burton v. Kearsley 15, a decision of Warrington J.; and In Re Shukers Estate, Bromley v. Reed 16, a decision of Simonds J. (as he then was). The earliest of these decisions is now fifty years old and no authority questioning them has been cited to us. On the other hand it is to be observed that in the last mentioned case Simonds J. indicated that, while he decided he ought to follow re Richards and re Ryder, his own inclination was to hold that such a power was not a general power of appointment. In the case at bar I do not find it necessary to decide this question, which I regard as difficult and doubtful, because, even on the assumption that the will of Mrs. Chipman gave to Dr. Chipman a general power to appoint the capital of the residue inter vivos I have reached the conclusion that the appeal must succeed.\nIn order to support the claim that Dr. Chipman was liable to pay succession duty in respect of that part of the residuary estate which he did not receive and which upon his death passed under the will of Mrs. Chipman to the residuary legatees named therein, it is necessary to find a provision in the Statute which, on a proper construction, imposes such a liability. In Maxwell on Statutes, 9th Edition, at page 291, the learned author says:\u2014\nIt is a well-settled rule of law that all charges upon the subject must be imposed by clear and unambiguous language, because in some degree they operate as penalties. The subject is not to be taxed unless the language of the statute clearly imposes the obligation.\nIn Coltness Iron Company v. Black 17, Lord Blackburn said:\u2014\nNo tax can be imposed on the subject without words in an Act of Parliament clearly shewing an intention to lay a burden on him.\nIt has been suggested that these statements are subject to some modification by reason of the terms of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1927 c. 1, section 15, but even if this be so, to use the words of Rand J. in In re Fleet Estate, Minister of National Revenue v. The Royal Trust Co. 18:\nA taxing Statute must make reasonably clear the intention to impose the tax.\nThe learned trial judge has held that the tax claimed by the respondent is imposed by section 31 . The section reads as follows:\u2014\n31. Where a general power to appoint any property either by instrument inter vivos, or by will, or both, is given to any person, the duty levied in respect of the succession thereto shall be payable in the same manner and at the same time as if the property itself had been given, devised or bequeathed, to the person to whom such power is given. As a matter of construction, I think it clear that the word \"thereto\" in the third line of the section refers to the word \"property\" in the first line. In my view, the section, whether read by itself, or, as it must be, as part of the Act considered as whole, does not purport to levy any duty or to create or define a succession. It provides only for the manner and time of payment of duty which is assumed to be levied by other provisions of the Statute. It is not without significance that section 31 is found in that part of the Statute which deals with the time and manner of the payment of duties but of greater importance is the sharp difference between its language and that employed in the levying sections, 6, 10 and 11 :\u2014 \"there shall be assessed, levied and paid \u2026\"\nIt is necessary therefore to examine the charging provisions of the Statute to discover what duty is levied in respect of the succession to the capital of the residue of Mrs. Chipman's estate as that is the property over which, ex hypothesi, Dr. Chipman was given a general power of appointment inter vivos.\nBy the applicable words of 6(a) (and of sections 10 and 11, which fix the rates) it is provided that there shall be assessed, levied and paid duties upon or in respect of successions to property. Nowhere in the Act is duty imposed except upon or in respect of successions to property. The capital of the residue is, of course, property, and the question is whether within the meaning of the words used in the Statute Dr. Chipman succeeded thereto. The learned trial judge held that while Dr. Chipman was a successor to the capital of the residue under section 31 , he was not a successor thereto under section 2(m) but it is desirable to examine that provision. It reads as follows:\u2014\n(m) 'succession' means every past or future disposition of property, by reason whereof any person has or shall become beneficially entitled to any property or the income thereof upon the death of any deceased person, either immediately or after any interval, either certainly or contingently, and either originally or by way of substitutive limitation, and every devolution by law of any beneficial interest in property, or the income thereof, upon the death of any such deceased person, to any other person in possession or expectancy, and also includes any disposition of property deemed by this Act to be included in a succession;\nApplying these words to the case at bar, the \"disposition\" with which we are concerned is the will of Mrs. Chipman, the \"property\" is the capital of the residue, the \"death of the deceased person\" is the death of Mrs. Chipman, and the question is therefore whether under her will, upon her death, Dr. Chipman became beneficially entitled to that capital \"either immediately or after any interval either certainly or contingently and either originally or by way of substitutive limitation.\" It appears to me that he did not. I am of opinion that upon the death of Mrs. Chipman, Dr. Chipman became beneficially entitled to the income from the residue and the residuary legatees became beneficially entitled to the capital thereof in remainder. I have already indicated my view that the legal effect of the relevant provisions of the will of Mrs. Chipman is the same under the law of Quebec as under the common law, and using the terminology of the latter, the residuary legatees immediately on the death of Mrs. Chipman took not a contingent but a vested remainder in the capital, expectant on the death of Dr. Chipman, subject to be divested in whole or in part by his exercise of the power to take during his lifetime such portion or portions of the capital as he might wish. So far as the capital of the residue was concerned no part of it became vested in Dr. Chipman upon Mrs. Chip-man's death or under any disposition made by her. No doubt upon his exercising the power Dr. Chipman became entitled to the part of the capital of the residue in respect of which he exercised it, and became so entitled under Mrs. Chipman's will by the operation of the rule of law that \"whatever is done in pursuance of a power is to be referred to the instrument by which the power is created, and not to that by which it is executed as the origin of the gift.\" (vide Farwell on Powers, 3rd Edition at page 318) ; but it was only to the extent that he exercised the power that he became beneficially entitled to any portion of such capital and it was conceded that he was liable to pay duty in respect of such portion. The respondent's argument depends upon the proposition that a person who is given a power over property thereby becomes beneficially entitled to such property but in my view this is not the law and no words in the Statute so provide. As is pointed out in Halsbury, 2nd Edition, Vol. 25, page 515:\u2014\nThe creation of a power over property does not in any way vest the property in the donee, though the exercise of the power may do so; and it is often difficult to say whether the intention was to give property or only a power over property. I have already indicated my view that as a matter of construction it is clear that Mrs. Chipman's will gave Dr. Chipman no property in the capital of the residue but only a power over it.\nDuring the argument the terms of sections 3(4) and 4(1) of the Act were fully discussed but they appear to deal with the question of what duties are payable upon the death of the donee of a power rather than with the question of the duties payable upon the death of the donor of a power, and their relevance to the question before us is limited to the bearing which they may have upon the proper construction of section 31 .\nIt is suggested that if the view which I have indicated is adopted difficulties will arise by reason of the terms of section 5 of the Act owing to the fact that during Dr. Chip-man's lifetime it would be impossible to predict how much of the capital he would take and how much would remain at his death ; but it would appear that under other provisions of the Act, particularly sections 23 and 48, the revenue can be amply safe-guarded.\nIt is argued for the respondent that unless section 31 is construed as levying duty it is meaningless but I am unable to agree. In the case at bar, on the assumption that a general power to appoint was given to Dr. Chipman, section 31 would seem to have the effect of requiring that all duties be paid in the manner and at the time provided in section 24 and of taking away the right to pay in the manner and at the times provided in section 28 which would otherwise have existed. But for section 31, the duties of the interests in expectancy given by clause (g) of the will of Mrs. Chipman might have been paid either within six months of her death (section 24(2)) or within three months of such interests falling into possesion (section 28(4)); and it will be observed that section 28(3) which permits this choice uses the words:\u2014 \"or in the manner provided by subsection four or subsection six of this section.\" As already indicated, after consideration of all the terms of the Statute, I find myself quite unable to construe the words of section 31 as levying any duty or defining any succession; and I can find no other provision which has the effect of levying the duty which the respondent contends is payable. For the above reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the assessment and order that the matter be referred back to the Minister in order that an assessment may be made upon the basis that the dutiable value of the succession to Dr. Chipman in respect of the residuary estate of Mrs. Chipman was the value as of the date of her death of the estimated net revenues from such residuary estate during the remainder of his lifetime and that the residuary legatees were assessable as having on the death of Mrs. Chipman become beneficially entitled to the capital of the residue in remainder expectant upon the death of Dr. Chipman, subject to the appropriate adjustment made necessary by the fact of Dr. Chipman having received $33,164.41 from such capital.

The declared objects of the company included the acquisition of timber lands, leases of such lands and licences to cut timber and turning the same to account, and of saw mills and other mills and factories for the manufacturing of lumber and lumber products, and of water rights for such purposes. The portion of the memorandum in which the objects were defined included the power to sell or otherwise dispose of the properties of the company. The company acquired extensive areas of timber lands in the Clayoquot and Nootka Districts on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, some of which were Crown granted and some held under timber leases from the Crown. In the year 1906 a lumber mill was built in the Clayoquot District and manufacturing commenced but, proving unprofitable, the operation was closed down at the end of 1907. Thereafter the lumber mill was kept in repair, surveys were made for the purpose of ascertaining the most profitable means of turning to account the timber upon the company's holdings, water rights were acquired and the preliminary work done for the construction of a dam for the purpose of utilizing such rights. In the year 1942 the mill had been dismantled on the order of the Machinery Controller of Canada and the machinery sold. According to the evidence, it had been the intention of those controlling the company since the year 1902 to utilize the timber limits for the manufacture of cedar lumber in a location in the Clayoquot District. In 1946 the company sold the greater part of its holdings in the Nootka area and was assessed under the Excess Profits Tax Act 1940 for the profit made upon the sale.\nHeld: The evidence disclosed that the business carried on and intended to be carried on by the company had not at any time been that of purchasing and selling timber lands or interests in such lands but that of manufacturing cedar lumber from the properties in a mill to be operated in the Clayoquot District : that the sale was of a capital asset which was not required and did not fit in to the company's plans for the operation of its main properties and the profit resulting from the sale was not assessable to Excess Profits Tax under the Act.\nAnderson Logging Co. v.

Eaton for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nLocke, J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Archibald J. 2 dismissing the appeal of the present appellant from an assessment made under the Excess Profits Tax Act 1940 for the taxation year 1946.\nThe assessment in question was made in respect of a profit of $95,102.90 made by the appellant upon the sale in the year 1946 of a parcel of Crown granted land described as Section 1, Nootka District, British Columbia, and its interest in seven renewable timber leases made between the Crown in right of the Province and the appellant in respect of lands in the said district. The appellant gave notice of appeal to the Minister of National Revenue under the provisions of section 14 of the Excess Profits Tax Act on the ground that the profit was not income, within the meaning of the Act, and the latter affirmed the assessment. Archibald, J. 3 in dismissing the appeal, apparently considered that the question to be determined was governed by the judgment of this Court in Anderson Logging Co. v. The King 4.\nThe Sutton Lumber and Trading Company Limited was first incorporated by a memorandum of association under the provisions of the Companies Act 1890 of the Province of British Columbia in the year 1893. In the year 1897 that Act was repealed and the various statutes dealing with the incorporation of companies consolidated in the Companies Act 1897. By s. 5 of that statute it was provided that a company theretofore incorporated by memorandum of association, upon compliance with prescribed formalities, might deliver to the Registrar of Companies a copy of its charter and regulations and its certificate of incorporation and receive a certificate of what was called the \"reincorporation\" and registration of the company as a company under the new Act. The appellant company, taking advantage of this provision, was reincorporated under the Act of 1897 on November 17, 1902 The authorized capital was $100,000, divided into 1,000 shares of $100 each, at which figure it has remained to the present day.\nThe British Columbia legislation providing for the incorporation of companies by memorandum of association followed the plan provided in England by the Companies Act of 1862. Companies so incorporated, as was decided in the House of Lords in Ashbury Carriage Company v. Riche 5, and in Attorney-General v. The Directors of the Great Eastern Railway Company 6, have no inherent common law rights and are accordingly restricted in their activities to carrying out the objects and exercising such powers as are described in the memorandum, including those which are fairly incidental to those things which the Legislature has authorized. No doubt, it was for this reason that until the passing of the Companies Act of 1929, which by s. 22 gave to all companies, thereafter incorporated by memorandum, extensive powers for the purpose of carrying out their declared objects without the necessity of enumerating them in the memorandum, the memoranda of association of many companies incorporated in the province included far reaching powers to carry on activities, many of which were far removed from the real purpose of the incorporation of the company.\nThe memorandum of association, in so far as its terms affect the present matter, reads as follows:\u2014\n2. The objects for which the Company is established are:\u2014\n(1) To purchase, take on lease, or otherwise acquire and hold any lands, timber lands or leases, timber claims, licenses to cut timber, rights of way, water rights and privileges, foreshore rights, wharves, saw mills, factories, buildings, machinery, plant, stock-in-trade, or other real and personal property, and equip, operate and turn the same to account, and to sell, lease, sublet or otherwise dispose of the same, or any part thereof, or any interest therein.\n(2) To purchase, lease, hire, build, and operate saw mills and other mills and factories for the manufacturing of lumber and sale of lumber, shingles, boxes, blinds, sash and furniture, and any other articles of which wood shall form a component part.\n(3) To carry on the business of saw mill proprietors and merchants and manufacturers of and dealers in timber and lumber of all kinds.\n(4) To construct dams and improve rivers, streams and lakes, and to divert the whole or part of the water of such streams and rivers as the purposes of the Company may require.\n(5) To catch, purchase, preserve, sell and deal in seals, and seal skins, and all kinds of fish, and the products thereof, respectively; to acquire, erect and operate fish canneries; and to purchase, sell and trade in general merchandise.\n(6) To carry on all or any of the businesses of dealers in furs, skins and fish, exporters and importers, carriers by land and water, warehousemen, wharfingers and general traders and merchants.\n(7) To construct, carry out, acquire by purchase or otherwise maintain, improve, manage, work, control and superintend any trails, roads, railways, tramways, bridges, reservoirs, watercourse aqueducts, wharves, saw mills, electrical works, telephones, factories, warehouses, ships, vessels, fishing and other boats, and other works and conveniences which the Company may think directly or indirectly conducive to any of these objects, and to contribute or otherwise assist or take part in the construction, maintenance, development, working, control and management thereof.\n(8) Generally to purchase, take on lease, hire, or otherwise acquire any real and personal property, and any rights and privileges which the Company may think necessary or convenient for the purposes of its business. (9) To use water, steam, electricity, or any other power now, or hereafter to become known as a motive power or in any other ways for the uses and purposes of the Company.\n(10) To acquire, operate, and carry on the business of a power company under Part IV of the Water Clauses Consolidation Act, 1897.\n(11) To acquire and carry on all or any part of the business or property, and to undertake any liabilities of any person, firm or association, or Company, possessed of property suitable for the purposes of this Company, or carrying on any business which this Company is authorised to carry on, or which can be conveniently carried on in connection with the same, or may seem to the Company calculated directly or indirectly to benefit the Company, and as the consideration for the same to pay cash or to issue any shares, stocks or obligations of this Company.\n(12) To enter into partnership or into any arrangement for sharing profits, union of interests, co-operation, joint adventure, reciprocal concessions, or otherwise, with any person or company carrying on, or engaged in, or about to carry on or engage in, any business or transaction which this Company is authorised to carry on or engage in, or any business or transaction capable of being conducted so as directly or indirectly to benefit this Company; and to lend money to, guarantee the contracts of, or otherwise assist any such person or Company, and to take or otherwise acquire shares and securities of any such Company, and to sell, hold, re-issue, with or without guarantee, or otherwise deal with the same.\n(13) To sell or dispose of the undertaking of the Company, or any part thereof, for such consideration as the Company may think fit, and in particular, for shares, debentures, or securities of any other Company having objects altogether, or in part, similar to those of this Company.\n(14) To promote any Company or Companies for the purpose of acquiring all or any of the property and liabilities of this Company, or for any other purpose which may seem directly or indirectly calculated to benefit this Company.\n(15) To borrow or raise money for any purpose of the Company, and for the purpose of securing the same and interest, or for any other purpose, to mortgage or charge the undertaking, or all or any part of the property of the Company, present or after acquired or its uncalled capital, and to create, issue, make, draw, accept and negotiate perpetual or redeemable debentures or debenture stock, promissory notes, bills of exchange, bills of lading, warrants, obligations and other negotiable and transferable instruments.\n(16) To take or otherwise acquire, and hold shares in any other Company having objects altogether or in part similar to those of this Company, or carrying on any business capable of being conducted so as directly or indirectly to benefit this Company.\n(17) To distribute any of the property of the Company among the members in specie. (18) To sell, improve, manage, develop, exchange, lease, mortgage, dispose of, turn to account, or otherwise deal with the undertaking, or all or any part of the property, and rights of the Company, with power to accept as the consideration any shares, stocks or obligations of any other Company.\n(19) To do all such other things as are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the above objects, or any of them.\nIt will be noted that, while the foregoing subparagraphs 1 to 18 are referred to in the opening words of the paragraph as objects, objects and powers are mingled. It is, in my opinion, a matter of some difficulty to sever what were intended as objects from those which were merely powers, but it seems to me to be clear that to operate and turn to account saw mills, factories, water rights and timber lands or leases in subparagraph 1 and the activities referred to in subparagraphs 2, 3, 5, 6 and 10 were clearly intended as objects, while the remainder of the subparagraphs were intended to define the powers taken for the purpose of carrying out such objects. When, for the purpose of obviating the necessity of defining the powers taken in such detail, the Legislature enacted s. 22 of the Companies Act 1919, the powers which were given to all companies thereafter incorporated as ancillary and incidental to the objects set forth in the memorandum included practically all of those enumerated in subparagraphs 1, 7, 8, 9 and 11 to 19, both inclusive, in addition to others. The powers so vested in every company incorporated under the terms of the Act of 1919 and in any company which might under the provisions of s. 51 of the Act, by ordinary resolution, alter its memorandum of association so as to include any or all of the powers referred to in s. 22, include, it is to be noted, the right:\u2014\n(a) To purchase, take on lease or in exchange, hire, or otherwise acquire and hold any real and personal property and any rights or privileges which the Company may think necessary or convenient for the purposes of its business; \u2026\n(l) To sell or dispose of the undertaking of the company or any part thereof for such consideration as the company may think fit \u2026\nAND\n(g) To sell, improve, manage, develop, exchange, lease, dispose of, turn to account, or otherwise deal with all or any part of the property and rights of the company. The question to be decided is not as to what business or trade the company might have carried on under its memorandum, but rather what was in truth the business it did engage in. To determine this, it is necessary to examine the facts with care.\nThe company was incorporated under the Act of 1890 at the instance of W. J. Sutton, J. E. Sutton and their associates and acquired from one of the Suttons a lease granted by the Provincial Government of ten sections in the Clayoquot District on the West Coast of Vancouver Island. By the terms of the Lands Act of 1888, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council were authorized to grant renewable leases for terms not to exceed thirty years, containing provisions binding the lessee to erect in some part of the Province a lumber mill capable of cutting not less than 1,000 ft. of lumber per day for every 400 acres of land included in the lease. The company, while controlled by the Suttons, had built and operated what was referred to as a small lumber mill. The extent of the holdings of the company during this time was apparently some 2,500 acres.\nIn November 1902, W. H. and A. F. McEwan of Seattle, the principals in the Seattle Cedar Lumber Manufacturing Company, which was engaged in the production of cedar lumber in the State of Washington, acquired the share interest of the members of the Sutton family. As shown by the Minute Book of the company, the McEwans and one of their solicitors at Victoria were appointed the first directors of the company following its reincorporation and a resolution was passed that the registered office be at No. 2 Broughton Street in Victoria.\nIn November 1903, B. W. Arnold, a lumberman carrying on business in Ontario and the Eastern United States, became a shareholder and was elected a director and thereafter agreed to advance to the company the funds necessary for the construction of what was referred to as a mill and logging plant at Clayquot. Between the years 1902 and 1905, renewable leases of large areas of timber in the Clayoquot area were obtained by the company from the Provincial Government and some Crown granted lands were purchased. In addition, during this time certain leases and some Crown granted lands were obtained in the Nootka District lying to the north of the Clayoquot District. The English Lumber Company, a Washington corporation, acquired shares in the company at a date which is not disclosed in the evidence. Whether the shares were held in the name of the company or that of Edward English, the directing head of the company, is not shown. No further leases or Crown grants of timber were acquired between 1905 and the time of the sale made in 1946 which gave rise to the present litigation.\nIn 1946, Mr. A. F. McEwan alone survived of those who had been the principals in the direction of the affairs of the appellant company in 1915 and he died before the present dispute arose. W. H. McEwan, Arnold and Edward English had all died long prior to that time. There was, however, in the employ of the Seattle Lumber Company Wm. C. Schultheis who, since the year 1898, had been employed by that company as a log and timber buyer and looked after the outside interests of the McEwans and was intimately familiar with the activities of the appellant company between the year 1902, when the McEwans first acquired their interest, up, until the present time. In 1923, on the death of W. H. McEwan, Schultheis had succeeded him as a director and had been elected Vice-President of the appellant company.\nSchultheis said that, at the time the McEwans acquired control of the appellant company, there was only a cursory examination made by cruisers of the limits in the Clayoquot area. There was only a limited time to take up the options his employers had taken upon the Suttons shares and the cruisers found enough timber to justify the purchase. Cedar predominated throughout the area. The Suttons apparently had not any cruise of the timber. It was apparently prior ho 1905 that certain leases had been obtained in the Nootka District, which lay in a different water shed than Clayoquot. In either of the years 1904 or 1905 the company purchased three Crown granted claims from a Captain Townsend, which were suitable for a mill site and booming grounds. In the year 1905 the company started clearing the land for the erection of a mill in Mosquito Harbour in the Clayoquot District and obtained fore shore leases at that place and booming ground rights near the mouth of the Kennedy River. In the same year, it applied for and obtained a water licence enabling it to divert water from Sutton Creek, a tributary of Mosquito Harbour, for the purpose of milling operations. In the year 1906 the mill was built, designed for the manufacture of cedar lumber and shingles. It was not designed to handle fir logs. The mill operated with logs cut from the adjoining limits of the company during the year 1907. The financial statement of the company as of January 1, 1908, showed an investment in buildings, machinery, machine shops, etc. in excess of $153,000. Other buildings including dwellings had accounted for an expenditure in excess of $14,000. Something more than $24,000 had been spent on dock construction in the harbour and for donkey engines and other equipment for use in logging, something more than $15,000 had been expended. The capital stock of the company remained at $100,000 and the company was indebted to its stockholders for loans of money, apparently for the acquisition of the timber limits, the payment of rentals and the construction and equipment of the mill in an amount approximating $460,000.\nThis was apparently the first time that a cedar mill had been operated on the West Coast of Vancouver Island and the results were not profitable. A cargo of lumber was shipped to the New York market which arrived there at the time of the financial panic of 1907 and a heavy loss resulted. The loss in the operations for the year 1907 approximated $150,000 and the mill was closed down. In so far as the market in the United States was concerned, Schultheis said it was decided to wait until the Panama Canal was completed. The location of the timber was such that during this period it was not possible to sell logs on the West Coast market at a profit. Owing to the necessity of rafts being towed for long distances in the open sea, such an operation was not possible and Davis rafts which might have made this feasible were not then known.\nThe financial statement of the company for the year 1909, during which neither the lumber nor shingle mills were operated, shows the investment of the company in the mill site before depreciation at $153,427.14, for outside buildings and dwellings $14,010.39, for the fresh water system $6,857.66, for dock construction $24,325.76, for woods plant comprising logging, donkeys, equipment, etc. $15,713.83, for the Tug Clayoquot $5,041.03, for the cook house and camp buildings $2,366.90, in addition to the amounts invested in boom chains and other miscellaneous equipment. The advances by shareholders to the company as at the end of the year totalled $462,000. A caretaker was employed at the mill and no logging operations were carried on.\nAccording to Schultheis, it was either in the year 1910 or 1911 that a timber cruiser was sent to make an examination of the Nootka limits and he reportd that they were predominantly fir. These limits constituted only about one-seventh of the company's holdings and it was not practical to operate a fir mill in the Nootka District and a cedar mill in Clayoquot. On October 10, 1911, at the annual meeting of the shareholders held at Victoria, the directors were authorised to sell for such consideration as they thought fit the three Crown granted lots in the Nootka District and the company's leasehold holdings in that area. Other than the Crown granted lots, these were the properties which were sold thirty-five years later, the sale resulting in the profit sought to be taxed in these proceedings.\nIn the year 1922 the company had all of the limits completely cruised. In the Nootka District the area of the Crown granted and leased lands was 10,195 acres, upon which there was an estimated 335,701,000 ft. B.M. of timber, the greater part of which was fir, hemlock and balsam; in the Clayoquot District, where there was comparatively little fir and cedar greatly predominated, the area of the limits was 63,665 acres, containing an estimated 1,955,616,000 ft. B.M. The evidence of the witness Schultheis, together with that of Mr. Aird Flavelle, a manufacturer of cedar lumber of very long experience on the West Coast and who had an intimate knowledge of the cedar market during the past forty years, show conclusively that, from the time of the acquisition of the limits until after the conclusion of the Second World War, the manufacture of cedar lumber on the properties or the sale of cedar logs from the limits was not economically possible. The company, however, maintained the lumber and shingle mill and the appurtenant properties in a state of repair, looking forward to the day when operations might become possible. In 1924, concrete foundations were placed under the mill replacing the timber posts originally installed. A caretaker was maintained continuously until it was dismantled in the year 1942.\nIn 1926, the company employed W. C. Morse, a hydraulic engineer, to advise as to the best means of bringing logs from Kennedy Lake, which lay in a southeasterly direction from the mill in Mosquito Harbour, down the Kennedy River to salt water, and after an extensive survey received his opinion as to the most feasible method and the probable cost. The engineer was further instructed to examine the area and report as to the possibilities of developing hydro-electric power in the Kennedy Lake area and as to suitable locations for a ground wood paper mill in the area, and two written reports made by him respectively in July and August 1926 were put in evidence. Mr. Morse advised that a suitable power site was available at the Kennedy River Rapids where there was an excellent dam site. He advised that a very large amount of timber would have to be cut and bucked before the lake level could be raised and advised as to its disposition. As to a site for such a mill, he said that there was a suitable location at the mouth of the Kennedy River with a wharf facing on deep navigable waters in Tofino Inlet and advised as to the cost of installations for the production of 9,550 and 18,500 horse power respectively. The engineer considered that the ideal combination to develop the timber in the Clayoquot District would be a cedar mill, a hemlock mill and a pulp and paper mill and, as between the existing location of the company's mill at Mosquito Harbour where the mill was, in his opinion, worth around $150,000, advised as to the suitability of a second site at the mouth of the Kennedy River and a third site at Mud Bay, giving figures as to the cost that would be involved in further construction at Mosquito Harbour if operations were to be continued there and if mills were constructed at the alternative sites. As an alternative to construction on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, the engineer considered and advised as to the cost of delivering logs to Alberni at the head of the Alberni Canal, assuming the company should decide to build a cedar mill at that point rather than in the vicinity of its Clayoquot holdings. In advance of incurring the expense of these surveys by Mr. Morse, a reservation of the water power in the area was made and the official findings of the engineer were filed with the Water Board at Victoria. A contract was made to drill the foundations for a dam at Kennedy Rapids1 and this work was done. The company also undertook negotiations with the Crown Zellerbach Corporation for the establishment of a pulp mill which continued over an extended period. The company had purchased a suitable property as a site for a pulp mill and town site at Mud Bay at a cost of $5,000, having accepted the recommendation of the engineer as to this. However, construction was not proceeded with and the depression commencing at the end of the year 1929 rendered impossible the profitable operation of the properties.\nOther than the logging and lumbering activities which were carried on in the years 1906 and 1907, no such operations were carried on until the year 1937 when the company, by a contract dated August 3, sold to Gibson Brothers Limited the merchantable timber on section 2, which was Crown granted, in the Nootka District and upon the lands covered by the timber lease of Lot 656 in that area. Upon these areas there was, as shown by the cruise, 50,809,000 ft. of fir and 6'51,000 ft. of cedar. The contract price was a stumpage rate of $3 per thousand of timber cut from the Crown granted lands and $2 per thousand for timber cut from the lease, and in addition 50 per cent of the net proceeds received from the purchaser from the sale of the logs, after the deduction of logging and marketing costs specified by the agreement. By the agreement, the purchasers agreed to log and raft not less than 10,000,000 ft. B.M. during each twelve month period and, on the demand of the vendor, to sell to it all cedar logs cut from the property from time to time at the then market price. By a further agreement dated August 17, 1938, the company agreed to sell to Gibson Brothers Limited all the merchantable timber on its timber lease on Lot 34 in the Nootka District on the same terms. The purchaser found the logging operations unprofitable and did not complete the logging of the said limits and, by an agreement dated March, 31, 1943, the two agreements were terminated and Gibson Brothers Limited was released from further liability. On March 31, 1945, the company entered into an agreement to sell the merchantable timber upon part of its holdings in the Clayoquot District to the North Coast Timber Company Limited at an agreed stumpage rate and, in addition, in consideration of 60% of the net proceeds which the purchaser should receive from the sale of all logs cut off the said lands, the purchaser agreeing to log and raft not less than 20,000,000 ft. and not more than 35,000,000 ft. in each period of twelve months throughout the term of the contract. Much of the timber so sold was upon limits that, according to Morse's survey, would be flooded by the construction of a hydro-electric plant on Kennedy River. The North Coast Company sold its interest in the contract to Kennedy Lake Logging Co. Ltd. and active logging operations were commenced and were being carried on at the time of the trial of this action. The logs cut were taken to mills at Port Alberni and this was apparently the first time that, following the termination of the Second World War in 1945, the market was such as to permit logging the cedar timber at a profit. The financial statement of the company for the year 1946 showed receipts from stumpage and profit sharing under the North Coast agreement amounting to $49,754.68.\nOther than such amounts as had been received from the logging operations of Gibson Brothers Limited, the company had had no income between the year 1907 and the year 1946. The moneys to provide for the payment of rentals, for the timber leases and for the other expenditures of the company were provided accordingly by loans made to the company by the shareholders which totalled as of December 31, 1946, $1,081,588.52.\nDuring the year 1946 the company sold to British Columbia Forest Products Ltd. section 1 and all of its interest in its timber leases in the Nootka District, realizing, according to its financial statement, a profit of $95,261.10, which was carried to capital surplus in the balance sheet.\nThe company's mill at Mosquito Harbour had been dismantled in the year 1942 on the order of the Machinery Controller of Canada and the machinery sold. It was impossible to buy machinery during the war years but, after the sale in 1946, the company had been endeavouring to locate a suitable mill site in the vicinity of the Alberni Canal and, in the year 1948, purchased a property at Ucluelet in the Clayoquot District which had been used as an airport during the war and upon which there were hangars and numerous other buildings, of which use might be made when establishing a mill, the consideration for the purchase being approximately $60,000.\nKeith Fisken, the Treasurer of the appellant company, had been a director since 1938 and President from that year until 1950, an officer of the Seattle Cedar Company since 1930 and was the executor of the estate of A. F. McEwan and intimately associated with the affairs of the appellant since being elected to its Board. Since 1938 he said that the directors had attempted on numerous occasions to find a way to operate the property but that every time it appeared that something could be done the cedar market fell. The English Lumber Company, to which the appellant company was indebted as of December 31, 1946, in the sum of $270;397.5'5 for advances and which held 25 per cent of the shares, got into difficulty with its creditors and its shares were taken over by them and further advances by that company were not available. In the existing state of the company's finances, the only source from which moneys for the construction of a mill and the developing of the property could be sought was from the shareholders. The company had not built a new mill up to the time of the inception of these proceedings.\nIn addition to the evidence of the actual activities carried on by the company since 1902, the appellant tendered at the hearing the evidence of Schultheis as to the business which those who controlled the company intended that it should carry on. Schultheis, as I have said, did not become a director of the company until 1923, when he was elected as such upon the death of A. F. McEwan. He was, however closely associated with the McEwans and their associates in the company and bad been present at many conferences between them and Arnold prior to 1905 and was clearly in a position to say how the then directors intended to deal with the property. Counsel for the Crown, however, objected to Schultheis giving evidence as to the business which it was intended that the company should carry on and the learned trial Judge ruled that his evidence was inadmissible, apparently on the ground that he was not then a director of the company. Thus, since all of those who were directors at the time were dead, the intention of those who controlled and directed its activities must be sought by inference from the record of the business actually carried on.\nIn my opinion, the evidence of Schultheis as to the business which the company proposed to carry on between the years 1902 and 1923 was improperly rejected. The record, however, of the activities of the company during this period is consistent only with the view that the intention was to carry on the business of operating a saw mill for the production of cedar lumber in the Clayoquot District. There had been no real cruise made of the timber in the Nootka area in 1910 or 1911 but the examination which had been made apparently led the directors to believe that the timber was predominantly fir and thus unsuitable for manufacturing into lumber in a cedar mill, whereupon they passed the resolution in October 1911 that these limits be disposed of. In fact, when an accurate cruise was made of all the properties by Gardiner and Baxter in 1922, it was disclosed that there was more cedar than fir upon the Nootka Limits. Taking, however, the hemlock, balsam and other species, the cruise showed the cedar to be only slightly more than one-third of the timber upon the property. The evidence of Schultheis, who was permitted to speak of the activities which the company proposed to carry on from the time in 1923 when he was elected a director, and of Fisken and the record of the heavy expenditures made by the company in Morse's survey, for the upkeep and maintenance of the mill, for the acquisition of a mill site, for a site for a pulp mill which could be operated in conjunction with a lumber mill, for the purchase of the mill and town site at Ucluelet and the acquisition of the water rights on Kennedy River, demonstrated, in my opinion, that those who controlled this company did not depart from their original intention to utilize these extensive limits for the manufacture of cedar lumber in a location in the Clayoquot District. The sales to Gibson Brothers and to the North Coast Timber Company were made in the hope of obtaining some money to assist in carrying the properties, which cost annually for rentals and taxes some $20,000, and the sale of the Nootka limits, which did not fit in to the proposed cedar operations, was to obtain funds to repay part of the long-standing indebtedness of the company to its shareholders.\nIn the reasons for judgment delivered at the trial, the learned trial Judge, commenting on the evidence of Schultheis, said that the evidence did not satisfy him that the witness had detailed knowledge respecting all the plans of the directors of the appellant company and that he could not accept his evidence as conclusive proof of the intent and purposes of the directors during the early years of its existence, adding that he found his evidence entirely unsatisfactory in that respect. With respect, this comment appears to overlook the fact that the evidence of Schultheis, which had been tendered as to the activities proposed to be carried on by the directors between the period 1902 to 1923, had been rejected. As to the business carried on and intended to be carried on from 1923 onward, the evidence is clear, direct and uncontradicted.\nThe case for the Minister is apparently based upon the fact that in subparagraph 1 of paragraph 2 of the memorandum the power \"to sell, lease, sublet or otherwise dispose of\" timber lands and leases was taken. It was apparently considered by the draftsmen of the memorandum that this power should be expressly taken. Had the Companies Act of 1897 included a section similar to s. 22 of the Act of 1929, the power to sell the limits would have been implied. The existence of this power does not afford evidence that the company was, in truth, carrying on the business of buying timber lands or acquiring leases and selling them with a view to profit. The evidence submitted by the appellant in the present case demonstrates the contrary. In Anderson Logging Company v. The King, above referred to, the appellant company was incorporated under the British Columbia Companies Act of 1907. The objects declared in the memorandum included the following:\u2014\nTo stake, lease, record, purchase, sell and deal in timber licenses, timber leases and timber lands and to cut and buy and sell timber of all sorts and to carry on a general business as logger and dealer in logs and timber of all sorts in British Columbia and elsewhere.\nThe company had purchased certain timber limits and these were sold at a substantial advance over their cost and the question was as to whether this profit was income, within the meaning of the Income and Personal Property Taxation Act (B.C.) 1921. While the company had carried on business for several years, no evidence was given as to the nature of the business actually carried on from the time of its inception until the year 1916, a fact commented on by: Duff, J. who delivered the judgment of the Court upholding the assessment. After pointing out that there was only evidence of one transaction, the purchase of the limits in question, the following further comment was made:\u2014\n(p. 51).\nIt is not unimportant to remark that neither of the principal partners of the company, who could have given a history of the company's affairs from its inception, was called as a witness, nor, as has already been mentioned, was any but the most meagre evidence adduced as to the character of the company's operations before 1916.\nIn the absence of the evidence of any one having any knowledge of what was referred to as the design of the directors of the company in purchasing the limits and as one of the substantive objects of the company, as declared by the memorandum, was to acquire timber lands and timber rights with a view to dealing in them and turning them to account for the profit of the company, it was held that the appellant had failed to show that the assessment was one which ought not to have been made.\nThe question as to whether or not the present appellant was engaged in the business of buying timber limits or acquiring timber leases with a view to dealing in them for the purpose of profit is a question of fact which must be determined upon the evidence. It may be noted that the memorandum of the appellant, while including the power to sell or dispose of timber properties, to deal in timber licenses is not one of the objects stated as it was in the Anderson case. Had it in fact included such an object, the evidence in this case demonstrated that the company at no time carried on or intended to carry on any such business. Unlike that case, in the present matter all the available evidence as to the activities carried on or intended to be carried on by the company in the fifty years prior to the time of the trial of this action was given or tendered by the appellant. The decision in that case does not, in my opinion, affect this matter. In Commissioner of Taxes v. The Melbourne Trust Limited 7, Lord Dunedin, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, quoted with approval the following passage from the judgment in California Copper Syndicate v. Harris 8:\nIt is quite a well settled principle in dealing with questions of income tax that where the owner of an ordinary investment chooses to realize it, and obtains a greater price for it than he originally acquired it at, the enhanced price is not profit in the sense of Schedule D of the Income Tax Act of 1842 assessable to income tax. But it is equally well established that enhanced values obtained from realization or conversion of securities may be so assessable where what is done is not merely a realization or change of investment, but an act done in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying out, of a business.\nIn the present case, the Nootka limite which were sold in 1946 were assets in which the company had invested with a view to cutting the merchantable timber into lumber in a mill to be erected by it in the Clayoquot District and the sale merely a realization upon one of its capital 'assets which was not required and did not fit in to the company's plans for the operation of its main property and one which was not made in the course of carrying on the business of buying, selling or dealing in timber limits or leases.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the judgment of the Exchequer Court and the assessments made set aside.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: O.F.

The Board found prima facie case for certification made out but found further that the secretary-treasurer of the Union, who had organized the local and as its acting secretary-treasurer signed the application, was a Communist and exercised a dominant influence in it. On this ground it refused certification. The respondent appealed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco for writ of mandamus which was granted. The company-employer appealed.\nHeld: (Taschereau Cartwright and Fauteux JJ dissenting):\u2011That the appeal should be dismissed.\nPer: Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand, Estey, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.\u2011The word \u201cmay\u201d in s. 92(2) of the Trade Union Act is to be interpreted as permissive and connoting an area of discretion. McHugh v. Union Bank [1913] A.C. 299, applied.\nPer: Kerwin, Rand and Estey JJ.\u2011The Board in rejecting the application exceeded the limits of its discretion since it was not empowered by the statute to act upon the view that official association with an individual holding political views considered dangerous by the Board proscribed a labour organization. Before such association would justify the exclusion of employees from the rights and privileges of statute designed primarily for their benefit there must be some evidence that with the acquiescence of the members it had been directed to ends destructive of the legitimate purposes of the Union.\nPer: Kellock J.\u2011The plain implication of s. 92(2) is that if the Board is satisfied with the application from the standpoint of the considerations the Statute itself sets forth the Union is entitled to be certified.\nPer: Taschereau, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. (dissenting)\u2011The Board exercised its discretion on sufficient grounds. Rex v. London County Council [1915] 2 K.B. 466, referred to.\nAPPEAL by the appellant-employer from an order of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1] allowing the appeal of the respondents on certiorari and ordering a peremptory writ of mandamus issued directed to the Labour Relations Board commanding it to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the Trade Union Act in respect of the application for certification of Local No. 18, Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of Canada and its members as the bargaining agent of a bargaining unit consisting of employees of the appellant.\nJ. J. Robinette, Q.C. for the appellant.\nI. M. MacKeigan and M. Wright for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Rand and Estey, JJ. was delivered by:\nRAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia sitting in banco[2] by which an order made by the Labour Relations Board of that province rejecting an application by the Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of Canada, Local 18, for certification as the bargaining agent of employees in a collective unit was, on certiorari, set aside and a mandamus to the Board directed. The latter had found the unit to be appropriate for bargaining purposes and 'that the other 'conditions to certification had been met; but, on the ground that one Bell, the secretary-treasurer of the Union, who had organized the local body and 'as its acting secretary-treasurer had signed the application, was a communist and the dominating influence in the Union, refused the certificate. The court in appeal held the Board to have had, in the circumstances, no discretion to refuse, but that even if it had, the discretion had been improperly exercised.\nBefore us, Mr. Robinette challenged both of these grounds. The first depends on the interpretation of the word \u201cmay\u201d in s. 9(2)(b) of the Trade Union Act which reads:\u2011\nIf a vote of the employees in the unit has been taken under the direction of the Board and the Board is satisfied that not less than 60 per cent of such employees have voted and that a majority of such 60 per cent have selected the trade union to be bargaining agent on their behalf; the Board may certify the trade union as the bargaining agent of the employees in the unit. The controlling consideration in this interpretation is the express declaration in s. 23(11) of the provincial Interpretation Act (1923 R.S.N.S. c. 1) that \u201cmay\u201d shall be construed as being permissive, subject to s. 22(1) which provides that the definitions so given shall apply \u201cexcept in so far as they are ... inconsistent with the interest and object\u201d of the acts to which they extend.\nS. 9 of the Trade Union Act, as well as the statute as a whole, exemplifies strikingly the contrasted uses of both \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d. For instance, in 9(1) we have \u201cthe Board shall determine whether a unit is appropriate\u201d; \u201cthe Board may ... include additional employees in the unit\u201d; \u201cthe Board shall take such steps to determine the wishes of the employees\u201d; 9(4) \u201cthe Board ... may, for the purpose ... make such examination of records or other inquiries, etc.\u201d; \u201cthe Board may prescribe the nature of the evidence to be furnished\u201d; 9(5) \u201cthe Board, in determining the appropriate unit, shall have regard to the community of interest\u201d; 9(7) \u201cif the Board is not satisfied ... it shall reject the application and may designate the time before a new application will be considered\u201d; s. 11, the Board \u201cmay revoke the certificate.\u201d\nThese examples could be multiplied and in the face of them it would, I think, be an act of temerity to hold that in the clause before us the word is to be taken in an imperative sense. The judgment of the Judicial Committee in McHugh v. Union Bank[3] is, in this respect, conclusive. There the language of the ordnance was virtually identical with the interpretation act here, although in the reasons a simpler expression is indicated: but as Lord Moulton puts it, \u201conly a clear case of impelling context would justify giving it an imperative construction.\u201d The earlier English cases are of little assistance because of the absence of such a clause, and, again to use Lord Moulton's words, \u201cthe object and effect of the insertion of the express provision as to the meaning of 'may' and 'shall' in the Interpretation Ordnance was to prevent such questions arising in the case of future statutes\u201d.\nI agree, therefore, with Mr. Robinette's first contention that the word is to be interpreted as permissive and as connoting an area of discretion. The remaining question is whether the Board, in its rejection, acted within the limits of that discretion, in examining which I assume the findings made as to Bell's adherence to the doctrines of communism and the strategy and techniques by which they are propagated.\nThe \u201cdomination\u201d I take to mean not particularly or directly that of the local union. Bell was, by the constitution of the federated body, the provisional secretary-treasurer of every local union until it had elected its own officers, and in fact he had ceased to hold that office of the applicant before the hearing had taken place, although he did not know of it until afterwards. Nor is it to be related to the fact of his having been an or the leading actor in organizing the local: that was part of the duties of his office.\nThe domination found was evidenced by Bell's forcefulness in the key position of general secretary-treasurer and organizer, by his acceptance of communistic teaching and by the fact that the party espousing those teaching demands of its votaries unremitting pressure, by deceit, treachery and revolution, to subvert democratic institutions and to establish dictatorship subservient to Soviet Russia. That is to say, the circumstance that an officer of a federated labour union holds to these doctrines is, per se, and apart from illegal acts or conduct, a ground upon which its local unions, so long as he remains an officer, can be denied the benefits of the Trade Union Act.\nNo one can doubt the consequences of a successful propagation of such doctrines and the problem presented between toleration of those who hold them and restrictions that are repugnant to our political traditions is of a difficult nature. But there are certain facts which must be faced.\nThere is no law in this country against holding such views nor of being a member of a group or party supporting them. This man is eligible for election or appointment to the highest political offices in the province: on what ground can it be said that the legislature of which he might be a member has empowered the Board, in effect, to exclude him from a labour union? or to exclude a labour union from the benefits of the statute because it avails itself, in legitimate activities, of his abilities? If it should be shown that the union is not intended to be an instrument of advantage and security to its members but one to destroy the very power from which it seeks privileges, a different situation is presented and one that was held to justify a revocation of the certificate by the Dominion Labour Board in Branch Lines Limited v. Canadian Seamen's Union[4].\nThe statute deals with the rights and interests of citizens of the province generally, and, notwithstanding their private views on any subject, assumes them to be entitled to the freedoms of citizenship until it is shown that under the law they have forfeited them. It deals particularly with employees in and of that citizenry and gives to them certain benefits in joint action for their own interests. Admittedly nothing can be urged against the bona fides of the local union; it seeks the legitimate end of the welfare of those for whom it speaks. During 1951, at least two local units of this union were certified by the Board notwithstanding that Bell at the time held the same office and adhered to the same views as found against him. One local includes employees working in the Halifax shipyards. Hubley, the associate of Bell in the application to the Board, who is president of the federated body, has been found by the Department of Defence to be unobjectionable on security grounds and is the holder of a pass to the Dartmouth shipyards; and the federation is affiliated with the Canadian Congress of Labour.\nTo treat that personal subjective taint as a ground for refusing certification is to evince a want of faith in the intelligence and loyalty of the membership of both the local and the federation. The dangers from the propagation of the communist dogmas lie essentially in the receptivity of the environment. The Canadian social order rests on the enlightened opinion and the reasonable satisfaction of the wants and desires of the people as a whole: but how can that state of things be advanced by the action of a local tribunal otherwise than on the footing of trust and confidence in those with whose interests the tribunal deals? Employees of every rank and description throughout the Dominion furnish the substance of the national life and the security of the state itself resides in their solidarity as loyal subjects. To them, as to all citizens, we must look for the protection and defence of that security within the governmental structure, and in these days on them rests an immediate responsibility for keeping under scrutiny the motives and actions of their leaders. Those are the considerations that have shaped the legislative policy of this country to the present time and they underlie the statute before us.\nI am unable to agree, then, that the Board has been empowered to act upon the view that official association with an individual holding political views considered to be dangerous by the Board proscribes a labour organization. Regardless of the strength and character of the influence of such a person, there must be some evidence that, with the acquiescence of the members, it has been directed to ends destructive of the legitimate purposes of the union, before that association can justify the exclusion of employees from the rights and privileges of a statute designed primarily for their benefit.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. (dissenting): I agree that by virtue of s. 9(2) of the Trade Union Act of Nova Scotia, a discretion is given to the Board to certify or not a Trade Union as the bargaining agent of a group of employees, and that this discretion may be exercised even if all the prescriptions of the Statute have been complied with.\nIn the case at bar, the Board declined to certify the applicant, because it was satisfied that it would be inconsistent with the principles and purposes of the Act, and contrary to the public interest, to have as bargaining agent a Trade Union whose organizer is a member of the Communist Party.\nI believe that in coming to that conclusion, the Board properly exercised its discretion conferred on it by the law, and that it is not the function of this Court to interfere in the matter.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.\nKELLOCK J.: The statute here in question provides by s. 7(1) that a trade union claiming to have as members in good standing a majority of employees of one or more employers in a \u201cunit\u201d that is \u201cappropriate for collective bargaining\u201d, may, subject to the rules and in accordance with the section, apply to be \u201ccertified as bargaining agent\u201d of the employees in the unit. S. 2(3) defines, for the purposes of the Act, \u201cunit\u201d as a \u201cgroup of employees\u201d and \u201cappropriate for collective bargaining\u201d as \u201cappropriate for such purposes\u201d whether the unit \u201cbe an employer unit, craft unit, technical unit, plant unit, or any other unit and whether or not the employees therein are employed by one or more employer.\u201d\n\u201cCollective bargaining\u201d is, in turn, defined by s. 2(1)(e) as \u201cnegotiating with a view to the conclusion of a collective agreement or the renewal or revision thereof\u201d, and \u201ccollective agreement\u201d as\nan agreement in writing between an employer or an employers' organization acting on behalf of an employer, on the one hand, and a bargaining agent of his employees, on behalf of the employees, on the other hand, containing terms or conditions of employment of employees that include provisions with reference to rates of pay and hours of work.\nWhere such an application is made under s. 7, the statute, by s. 9(1), requires the board to determine whether the unit in respect of which the application is made is appropriate for collective bargaining, i.e., whether the group is such that a collective agreement between it and the employer or employers should come about. In making that determination the board is required by s.-s. (5) of s. 9 to have regard to\nthe community of interest among the employees in the proposed unit in such matters as work location, hours of work, working conditions and methods of remuneration.\nAlthough, as already mentioned, a unit is expressly defined by s. 2(3) to be appropriate whether or not the employees therein are employed by one or more employers, in the case of an application for certification with respect to a unit whose members are employed by two or more employers, s. 9(3) prohibits the board from certifying the union as bargaining agent unless (a) all the employers consent, and (b) the board is satisfied that the union could be certified under the section as bargaining agent in the unit of each employer if separate applications for such purposes were made. Moreover, s.-s. (6) of s. 9 prohibits the board from certifying any union \u201cthe administration, management or policy of which is, in the opinion of the board, dominated or influenced by an employer, so that its fitness to represent employees for the purpose of collective bargaining is impaired.\u201d When, therefore, the statute provides by s.-s. of s. 9 that when the board has determined that a unit of employees is appropriate for collective bargaining and is satisfied that the majority of the employees in the unit are members in good standing of the applicant trade union, it \u201cmay\u201d certify the union as the bargaining agent of the employees in the unit, the statute contemplates, in my view, that the question of appropriateness of the unit is to be decided with regard to the considerations the statute itself sets forth to which I have referred. Provided that the board, acting upon these considerations, is satisfied that a majority of the members of the unit are members of the applicant union, and that the union itself comes within the definition of \u201ctrade union\u201d contained in s. 2(1)(r), other considerations are irrelevant.\nWhile s. 9(2) uses the word \u201cmay\u201d, that provision does not stand alone. S.-s. (7) provides that\nIf the Board is not satisfied that a trade union is entitled to be certified under this Section, it shall reject the application.\nIn this language the subsection recognizes that a union can become \u201centitled\u201d to certification under the section, and this, obviously, before actual certification. This, to my mind, would create a direct contradiction, if the statute were, at the same time, to be construed as giving a discretion to the Board enabling it to reject such a rightful claim. In my view the plain implication of the subsection is that, if the board is satisfied with the application from the standpoint of the considerations to which I have referred, the union is \u201centitled\u201d to be certified.\nI think this view is confirmed by reference to s. 8, which provides that where a group of employees belong to a craft or a group exercising technical skills by reason of which they are distinguishable from the employees as a whole, and the majority of the group are members of one trade union pertaining to such craft or other skills, the trade union may apply to the board, subject to the provisions of s. 7, and if the group is otherwise appropriate as a unit for collective bargaining, the union \u201cshall be entitled\u201d to be certified as the bargaining agent of the employees in the group. In my opinion this section, bringing in, as it does, the provisions of s. 7 and those provisions of s. 9 which relate to the appropriateness of a unit for collective bargaining purposes, provides expressly for the same result which, in the view above expressed, is provided for by s. 9. I do not think that the legislature intended any different result in eases coming within s. 8 from those not within that section. The statute is harmonized by the construction above set forth, and in my opinion should be so construed.\nThe decision of the Labour Board, accordingly, was reached upon a consideration of extraneous matters. I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting): For the reasons given by my brother Rand I agree with his conclusion that on a proper construction of s. 9(2) of The Trade Union Act (1947 N.S. 11 Geo. VI c. 3) the Board is given a discretion as to whether or not it will certify a trade union as the bargaining agent of the employees in a unit although, as in the case at bar, all statutory conditions precedent to certification have been fulfilled by the applicant.\nThe Act does not expressly indicate the principles by which the Board is to be guided in exercising this discretion and these must be deduced from a 'consideration of the statute as a whole. The view which the Board has taken on this point and its reasons for exercising its discretion against certification are 'expressed in the following words in its reasons for judgment:\u2014\nThe main purpose of the Nova Scotia Trade Union Act is to facilitate and encourage collective bargaining in good faith between employers and trade unions representing their employees as a means of attaining peaceful settlement of differences or disputes concerning wages, hours and conditions of work and other matters affecting their employment. The legal effect of certification of a trade union as a \u201cBargaining Agent\u201d is to confer on the union (a) the power to require the employer of the employees in the \u201cbargaining unit\u201d to bargain exclusively and in good faith with the certified union concerning wages, hours and conditions of work and other employer-employee relations, and (b) the power to represent and hence determine the rights not only of members of the certified union but also of all other employees in the designated \"bargaining unit\" whether or not they belong to the union. The public interest in good faith exercise of these powers solely for the benefit of the employees as such, and also in the conduct of collective bargaining in good faith by both union and employer is very great. The Board finds in this case that:\nThe Applicant was organized by and is a constituent part of the Maritime Marine Workers' Federation. The Secretary-Treasurer of the Federation, who is its administrative Executive Officer and the principal organizer is J. K. Bell who exercises dominant leadership and direction of the Federation. The application for certification in this case was made and signed by J. K. Bell and M. S. Hubley and J. K. Bell appears as the provisional Secretary-Treasurer of the Applicant Union. J. K. Bell is a member of the Communist party (self-styled in Canada the Labour Progressive Party).\nThe Communist party is a highly disciplined organization, the actions of whose members are rigidly controlled by its leaders who require the policies and aims laid down by them to be slavishly followed by party members.\nThe Communist party differs essentially from genuine Canadian political parties in that it uses positions of trade union leadership and influence as a means of furthering policies and aims dictated by a foreign government. Statements and actions of Communists show that their policy is designed to weaken the economic and political structure of Canada as a means of ultimately destroying the established form of government.\nConsequently to certify as bargaining agent a union while its dominant leadership and direction is provided by a member of the Communist party would be incompatible with promotion of good faith collective bargaining and would confer legal powers to affect vital interests of employees and employer upon persons who would inevitably use those powers primarily to advance Communist aims and policies rather than for the benefit of the employees.\nTherefore, exercising the discretion conferred by the Trade Union Act on the Board to refrain from certifying an Applicant as Bargaining Agent when the Board is satisfied on reasonable grounds that certification would be inconsistent with the principle and purpose of the Act and contrary to the public interest, the Board denies certification to the Applicant herein.\nThe legislature has not given any right of appeal from a decision of the Board and the question to be decided is whether, in the case at bar, sufficient grounds have been shewn to warrant the Court interfering by way of mandamus with the exercise of the Board's discretion. The following passage in Halsbury (2nd Ed.) Vol. 9, p. 764 appears to me to state accurately the general rule governing such cases as this:\u2014\nIn cases where application is made for the issue of a writ of mandamus to tribunals of a judicial character, the writ will only be allowed to go commanding such tribunals to hear and decide a particular matter. No writ will be issued dictating to their in what manner they are to decide. Where, accordingly ... any ... tribunal of a judicial character have in fact heard and determined any matter within their jurisdiction, no mandamus will issue for the purpose of reviewing their decision. The rule holds good even though such decision is erroneous, not only as to facts, but also in point of law; ... The Court will only interfere when the tribunal has not properly exercised its jurisdiction and has not heard and determined according to law, because it has taken into account extraneous matters and allowed itself to be influenced by them.\nFor the purposes of this branch of the matter the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in Banco has accepted the findings of fact made by the Board. These findings were challenged before us by counsel for the respondent. Assuming that the Court is entitled to examine the evidence which was before the Board, and having in mind the wide power given to the Board by s. 55(7) to receive evidence whether admissible in a Court of law or not, I am unable to say that there was no evidence before the Board to support the conclusions of fact upon which its decision is founded and it is not for the Court to weigh the evidence.\nThe judgments delivered in Rex v. London County Council[5] by the Divisional Court (Lord Reading C.J. and Bray and Shearman JJ.) and by the Court of Appeal (Buckley, Pickford and Bankes LL.JJ.) are most helpful. In that case rules nisi were obtained directed to the Council to show cause why a writ of mandamus should not issue commanding them to hear and determine certain applications for the renewal of music and cinematograph licences, which they had refused, upon the ground that they were actuated by extraneous considerations namely the shareholding and nationality of shareholders in the applicant, which was an English company. It appeared that the majority of such shareholders were alien enemies. The rules were discharged. I quote the following passages, with all of which I respectfully agree:\u2014\nFrom the judgment of Lord Reading C.J. at page 475:\u2014\n... It must be borne in mind that this Court, in determining whether or not the mandamus should issue, is not exercising appellate jurisdication. We are not entitled to decide according to the view we should have taken in the first instance had the matter come before us. We should only order the mandamus to issue if we came to the conclusion that the Council, by taking into consideration the enemy character of the constitution of the company, had allowed their minds to be influenced by extraneous considerations. The Council in these matters are the guardians of the public interest and welfare. From the judgment of Bray J. at page 479:\u2014\n... In considering the fitness of the persons the Council must not be guided by extraneous considerations. It is clear that in this case the Council were guided by the consideration that the large majority of the shareholders were alien enemies, and the question for us is whether this was an extraneous consideration. It seems to me to be clearly permissible for the Council to consider when a company is the applicant who are the persons who control the company. If it clearly appeared that such persons were not fit persons to have the licences the licences ought not to be granted. Next, is it permissible to consider whether such persons are alien enemies? These exhibitions have a strong influence on the minds of the spectators\u2014in some cases a bad influence. Alien enemies have a strong motive to injure this country, and there would be a risk of their exercising this influence contrary to the interests of this country. It is said that there must be evidence that such an injury ought to be anticipated. It is impossible that there should 'be such evidence. There has been no experience which could afford such evidence. Is it not sufficient that in the opinion of the members, or the majority of the members, of the London County Council there is such a risk? They cannot wait and see. The licence is for a year. If there is such a risk, why is the risk to be run? It seems to me to be entirely a matter for the Council in their discretion to say whether or not it is desirable in the interest of the public that licences should be granted to a company controlled by alien enemies. It is not, in my opinion, an extraneous consideration. The Legislature has thought fit to leave it to the Council to say whether the applicants are fit persons, and we cannot direct them to hear and determine the matter because we might think\u2014and I am far from saying I do so think\u2014that these were fit persons.\nFrom the judgment of Buckley L.J. at page 488:\u2014\n... The Lord Chief Justice was well founded in saying:\u2014 \u201cIf the Council are of opinion that the exhibition of cinematograph films accompanied by music should not be entrusted to a company so largely composed of persons whose interest or whose desire at the present time is or may be to inflict injury upon this country, can it be held as a matter of law that the Council have travelled beyond the limits allowed to them? I think not.\u201d The Council had to consider whether they would give a license to a company, in the name of an agent, which might be controlled or influenced by persons actuated by hostility to this country. If acting bona fide they thought that was a circumstance which ought to guide them in the exercise of their discretion, it was for them and not for us to determine. The only question we have to determine is whether the body with whom exclusively the determination of that matter lies has acted fairly and according to law.\nIn the case at bar, the Board was guided by the fact, as found by it, that the dominant leadership and direction of the applicant union was provided by a member of the Communist party, to the conclusion that certification would be inconsistent with the principle and purpose of the Act and contrary to the public interest. I am quite unable to say as a matter of law that this was an extraneous consideration. It must not be forgotten that under s. 11 certification once granted may be revoked but only after it has been in effect for not less than ten months. It is not necessary that I should express an opinion as to whether the decision of the Board was right or wise. It appears to me to be a decision made in the bona fide exercise of a discretion which the legislature has seen fit to commit to it and not to the courts.\nCounsel for the respondent submitted that we should not entertain this appeal because no appeal was taken from the order of the Supreme Court in banco quashing the order of the Board, but this does not seem to me to relieve us of the duty of dealing with the order for the issue of a mandamus which is properly before us.\nI would allow the appeal and set aside the order of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco directing the issue of a writ of mandamus. The appellant is entitled to its costs of this appeal and in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C. B.

F. P. Varcoe Q.C. and L. A. Couture for the appellants.\nR. P. Anderson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014 The relevant facts of this appeal are the following:\u2014 On the 5th of March, 1952, the respondent, a Chinese temporarily living at Hong Kong, made an application through his father, Leong Hung Hing, for an order directing D. N. McDonell, Acting District Superintendent for the Pacific District of the Immigration Branch of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration, to show cause why he has refused and continues to refuse to consider the application of the respondent for his admission to Canada, and why an order should not be made ordering him, the said D. N. McDonell, to consider the application. Mr. Justice Clyne before whom the application was made, directed the issue of a writ of mandamus ordering the Immigration Officer forthwith to consider the said application, and the Court of Appeal of British Columbia unanimously confirmed this decree.\nUnder the authority of s. 38 of the Immigration Act (c. 93, R.S.C. 1927) which allows the Governor-in-Council, by proclamation or order, to prohibit or limit in number, for a stated period or permanently, the landing in Canada of immigrants belonging to any nationality or race, the Governor-in-Council made the following regulation:\u2014\nFrom and after the 16th August, 1930, and until otherwise ordered, the landing in Canada of any immigrant of any Asiatic race is hereby prohibited, except as hereinafter provided:\nThe Immigration Officer-in-Charge may admit any immigrant who otherwise complies with the provisions of the Immigration Act, if it is shown to his satisfaction that such immigrant is,\u2014\nThe wife, the husband, or the unmarried child under twenty-one years of age, of any Canadian citizen legally admitted to and resident in Canada, who is in a position to receive and care for his dependents.\nIt will therefore be seen that, if the immigrant otherwise complies with the provisions of the Immigration Act, he may be admitted if he is the unmarried child, under twenty-one years of age of any Canadian citizen, legally admitted and resident in Canada.\nThe father Leong Hung Hing was born in China in 1884 and he married his first wife Fong Shee in June, 1911, in China, and she died in 1936. Hung Hing came to Canada and was admitted in September, 1911, and visited China in 1926 and also in 1932. Having had no children of his union with Fong Shee, he contracted in 1926, on his first visit to China, an alleged second marriage with a Chinese woman in accordance with local custom. To Hung Hing and this woman, two children were born, one of whom was the applicant respondent in the present case, and whose admission to Canada is now applied for.\nHung Hing maintained not only his wife but the children and their mother, by forwarding annually from $500 to $600, while he was here employed as a cook in Vancouver. In fact, he lived some two years with them in the one establishment from 1932 to 1934. Hung Hing was granted a certificate of Canadian citizenship in February, 1951, and it was during the following month that he applied to the Immigration Officer-in-Charge in Vancouver for the admission to Canada of Ba Chai. In April of the same year, he was advised by the Immigration Officer that his application had been rejected since Ba Chai was, in the view of the Officer, an illegitimate child.\nMany important questions have been raised by the Attorney General on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, but I have come to the conclusion that they need not all be considered and that, if it be established that the respondent has been legitimated in China, while the father had his domicile in China, the law of Canada will recognize this child as legitimate within the meaning of the regulation, because the personal status of the respondent as to his legitimacy, is governed by the law of the domicile of his father. (Vide Dicey's Conflict of Laws, 6th ed. page 86; Wahl v. Attorney General[3]; In Re Goodman's Trust[4]; Shedden v. Patrick[5]; Khoo Leong v. Khoo Hean Kwee[6]; Rajotte v. Trottier[7]; Stephens v. Falchi[8]. In that case, it will be unnecessary to consider if the word \"child\" found in the regulation includes an illegitimate child.\nIn order to prove the Chinese law, the respondent called Mr. Harry Fan who lives in Vancouver, and who is a graduate of the University of British Columbia and also a graduate of Chutow University Law School, where he studied during a period of three years, and he is therefore qualified to practise law in Shanghai, China. Mr. Fan explained that in China, where the civil law was codified in 1930, a child born out of wedlock is an illegitimate child, but the law provides for legitimation. This legitimation may take place by the subsequent marriage of the natural parents, and secondly, by acknowledgment. He stated that there are three ways of acknowledgment, but it is necessary to refer to the third only which is by the maintenance by the father of the natural child. Article 1065 of the Civil Code of China reads as follows:\u2014\nA child born out of wedlock who has been acknowledged by the natural father is deemed to be legitimate; where he has been maintained by the natural father, acknowledgment is deemed to have been established.\nDuring the argument, Mr. Anderson acting on behalf of the applicant, was informed by the Court that he did not need to elaborate any further the questions of domicile of the father, of the validity of the second marriage, of the proof of the foreign law, and of the illegitimacy of the child. The Court was of opinion, as the courts below found, that if the father changed his domicile in 1951 when he became a Canadian citizen, he nevertheless had not abandoned his Chinese domicile at the time his child was born in 1933. The Court also thought that whether the second marriage was valid or not, the child had become from the time of his birth a legitimate child, since the law, which was sufficiently proven, had a retroactive effect owing to the fact that the child was legitimated by acknowledgment. It was therefore found unnecessary to discuss the question as to whether the word \"child\" included an illegitimate child.\nIt naturally follows that the applicant being the legitimate son, under twenty-one years of age, of a Chinese citizen, legally admitted to and resident in Canada, does not fall within the ban of the regulation, but may be admitted to the country, if he otherwise complies with the provisions of the Immigration Act.\nIt is claimed by the appellants that a writ of mandamus does not lie, and that no order may be issued directing the Immigration Officer to consider the application for admission of Ba Chai into Canada as an immigrant. With this, I disagree. What is asked is not the admission of Ba Chai into Canada, but the consideration of his application which must be examined in the light of the Immigration Act. This has been illegally denied.\nAs the result of an error in law, because he believed that the applicant was not the child of Hung Hing, within the meaning of the regulation, the Immigration Officer refused to exercise his jurisdiction, It was conceded by the Attorney General that there was no right of appeal from this decision in the present case. The more convenient, beneficial and effective mode of redress, is by way of mandamus, as there is no other legal specific remedy for enforcing the applicant's right to a hearing before the Board and the Minister. Now that it is established that Ba Chai is the legitimate child of Hung Hing, the Immigration Officer should determine whether he otherwise complies with the provisions of the Immigration Act.\nA quite similar case was heard by this Court in 1904 (Drysdale v. Dominion Coal Co.[9]). The Commissioner of Mines for Nova Scotia had refused to take into consideration an application of the Dominion Coal Company, concerning a dispute between that company and one John Murray, as to their respective rights to certain leases of Crown lands. It was held that the company was entitled to a determination of those rights, and that the remedy was by way of mandamus. It may also be useful to consider what was said by Locke J. in Joy Oil v. The King[10], where the record, on a petition of right, was returned to the Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation, so that it could deal with the claims for subsidies advanced in the action.\nIt has been held several times that when a duty has to be performed by the Crown, the courts cannot claim any power to command the Crown (The Queen v. Lords Commissioners of the Treasury[11]; Short & Mellor, The Practice of the Crown Office, 2nd ed. 1908, page 202). This is not the case in the present instance.\nOther considerations would have to be taken into account if the Immigration Officer were a servant of the Crown, acting in his capacity of servant and liable to answer only to the Crown (The Queen v. Secretary of State for War (1)). But, the Immigration Officer has been designated by statute to fulfil a particular act. He is charged with a public duty which runs in favour of the respondent in whom it created a civil right (The Minister of Finance v. The King (2)). If he refuses to act and discharge that duty, he is amenable to the ordinary process of the Courts.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General of Canada: F.

The respondent's claim for fees and disbursements in respect of the undertaking was maintained by the trial judge and a majority in the Court of Appeal as both Courts came to the conclusion that such claim was not prohibited by the Architects Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c, 272.\nHeld: (Rand and Kellock JJ. dissenting), that the appeal should be allowed in part.\nPer Curiam: The Architects Act is a statute of public order voiding all contracts made in breach of it; consequently, the respondent cannot recover the fees in respect of the plans and specifications since the contract to prepare them was null by virtue of s. 12 of the Statute.\nPer Taschereau, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: The contract to supervise the works was not in breach of the Statute; it was, in this case, a separate agreement and was severable from the agreement to prepare the plans and specifications.

Il r\u00e9clame la valeur et le prix de services professionnels rendus et d\u00e9bours\u00e9s faits \u00e0 la demande du d\u00e9fendeur Pauz\u00e9.\nPar \u00e9crit en date du 9 juillet 1948, Gauvin accepta de pr\u00e9parer les plans et les devis et de surveiller les travaux pour la construction d'un immeuble devant \u00eatre situ\u00e9 sur la rue de la Gare \u00e0 Montmagny, et son honoraire fut fix\u00e9 \u00e0 5 pour cent du co\u00fbt total des travaux, soit 2\u00bd pour cent pour les plans et devis, payables lors de leur-livraison, et 2\u00bd pour cent pour la surveillance des dits travaux, payable mensuellement sur estim\u00e9s.

Cette loi se trouve au chapitre 272 des Statuts Revis\u00e9s de Qu\u00e9bec 1941, et l'article qui nous int\u00e9resse est l'article 12 qui se lit ainsi:\u2015\n12. Nulle personne, sauf si elle est architecte-paysagiste, ne peut prendre ou employer le nom ou le titre d'architecte, soit seul ou joint \u00e0 quelque autre mot, nom, titre ou d\u00e9signation, ni agir comme tel, soit directement ou indirectement, \u00e0 moins qu'elle ne soit enregistr\u00e9e comme membre de la dite association.\nToute personne qui n'\u00e9tant pas enregistr\u00e9e comme membre de la dite association, prend. ou emploie tel nom, titre ou d\u00e9signation ou agit comme architecte ou fournit des plans ou devis r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s pour la construction ou la reconstruction d'\u00e9difices, soit directement ou indirectement, est passible d'une amende d'au moins cent dollars et d'au plus deux cents dollars pour la premi\u00e8re infraction, et d'au moins trois cents dollars et d'au plus cinq cents dollars pour toute infraction subs\u00e9quente, et, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de paiement imm\u00e9diat de l'amende et des frais, d'un emprisonnement durant un terme n'exc\u00e9dant pas quatre-vingt-dix jours, \u00e0 moins que cette amende et les frais ne soient plus t\u00f4t pay\u00e9s.\nLe dernier article de la m\u00eame loi qui vise \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les int\u00e9r\u00eats des membres de la Corporation des Ing\u00e9nieurs Professionnels de Qu\u00e9bec, stipule que:\nRien dans la pr\u00e9sente loi ne devra \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme affectant de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit les droits conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la loi, aux membres de la Corporation des Ing\u00e9nieurs Professionnels de Qu\u00e9bec.\nLa loi de la Corporation des Ing\u00e9nieurs Professionnels de Qu\u00e9bec (Chap. 270 S.R.Q. 1941), ne d\u00e9finit pas les mots \"ing\u00e9nieur civil\", mais d'une fa\u00e7on vague et impr\u00e9cise, tente d'\u00e9num\u00e9rer les attributions de la. profession. L'article 2 est ainsi formul\u00e9:\u2015\n4\u00b0. L'expression 'ing\u00e9nieur civil' signifie quiconque exerce les fonctions d'ing\u00e9nieur, en donnant des conseils sur, en faisant des mesurages, trac\u00e9s ou dessins pour, ou en surveillant la construction de chemin de fer, ponts m\u00e9talliques, ponts en bois dont le co\u00fbt exc\u00e8de six cents dollars, voies publiques requ\u00e9rant les connaissances et l'exp\u00e9rience d'un ing\u00e9nieur, routes, canaux, 'havres, am\u00e9liorations de rivi\u00e8res, phares, et travaux hydrauliques, \u00e9lectriques, m\u00e9caniques, municipaux et autres travaux d'ing\u00e9nieur, non compris les chemins de colonisation du gouvernement et les chemins ordinaires dans les municipalit\u00e9s rurales; mais elle n'est pas cens\u00e9e s'appliquer \u00e0 un artisan ou \u00e0 un ouvrier expert. S.R.. 1925, c. 218, s. 2. Je suis port\u00e9 \u00e0 croire, malgr\u00e9 que je r\u00e9serve mon opinion sur ce point, que le mot \"signifie\" employ\u00e9 dans cet article 2, limite d'une fa\u00e7on restrictive les privil\u00e8ges exclusifs des ing\u00e9nieurs professionnels. L'expression \"comprend\" que l'on trouve dans certains statuts a beaucoup plus d'extension, et n'a pas, de caract\u00e8re limitatif. Mais m\u00eame, si dans le cas qui nous occupe, l'expression employ\u00e9e ne permet pas d'\u00e9tendre les privil\u00e8ges exclusivement r\u00e9serv\u00e9s aux ing\u00e9nieurs, et ne couvre que les privil\u00e8ges qui sont mentionn\u00e9s, il r\u00e9sulte tout de m\u00eame que l\u00e0 ne r\u00e9sident pas leurs seuls pouvoirs. La loi en effet \u00e9num\u00e8re les privil\u00e8ges des ing\u00e9nieurs mais ne limite pas leurs pouvoirs. Ils peuvent certes faire ce qui n'est pas d\u00e9fendu par d'autres lois. Ils peuvent par exemple poser des actes qui ne contreviennent pas \u00e0 la loi des Architectes. Les statuts cr\u00e9ant ces monopoles professionnels sanctionn\u00e9s par la loi, dont l'acc\u00e8s est contr\u00f4l\u00e9, et qui prot\u00e8gent leurs membres agr\u00e9\u00e9s qui remplissent des conditions d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, contre toute concurrence, doivent cependant \u00eatre strictement appliqu\u00e9s. Tout ce qui n'est pas clairement d\u00e9fendu peut \u00eatre fait impun\u00e9ment par tous ceux qui ne font pas partie de ces associations ferm\u00e9es.\nOn ne peut, je crois, entretenir aucun doute sur le fait que l'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 des plans et devis pour le compte de l'appelant, et qu'il r\u00e9clame maintenant le prix des services rendus. Cette pr\u00e9paration des plans est clairement contraire au texte de la loi qui dit que seuls les architectes peuvent \"fournir des plans ou devis r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s pour la 'construction d'\u00e9difices\" et que toute violation de la loi entra\u00eene une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, la loi des Ing\u00e9nieurs ne conf\u00e8re pas ce privil\u00e8ge aux membres de la Corporation des Ing\u00e9nieurs, de sorte que la loi des Architectes n'affecte en rien les droits conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la loi aux ing\u00e9nieurs professionnels.\nC'est la pr\u00e9tention de la demande que la loi des Architectes est d'un caract\u00e8re priv\u00e9, qu'elle n'existe que pour la r\u00e9gie de la Corporation et de ses membres, qu'elle ne frappe pas le contrat de nullit\u00e9, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence elle ne prive pas le demandeur qui aurait ill\u00e9galement exerc\u00e9 la profession d'architecte, de r\u00e9clamer ses honoraires. Il ne serait tout au plus passible que d'une amende payable \u00e0 la Corporation des Architectes. Ce n'est pas la premi\u00e8re fois que les tribunaux sont saisis d'un semblable litige et qu'on ait eu \u00e0 d\u00e9cider que cette loi des Architectes \u00e9tait une loi d'ordre public. Je suis enti\u00e8rement d'accord avec cette jurisprudence, de m\u00eame qu'avec les opinions \u00e9mises par les juges dissidents dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. Le pr\u00e9ambule de la loi cr\u00e9ant la Corporation, invoque comme justification de son adoption par la L\u00e9gislature, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public. On a \u00e9videmment avec raison voulu procurer des 'hommes de l'art r\u00e9ellement comp\u00e9tents au public, qui \u00e0 juste titre requiert que les \u00e9difices soient convenablement construits. Le pr\u00e9ambule qui fait partie d'un acte sert \u00e0 l'expliquer (12 C.C.).\nDans une cause de L'Association des Architectes de la province de Qu\u00e9bec v. Gari\u00e9py 3, M. le Juge McDougall dit \u00e0 la page 143:\u2015\nAs this is a matter of public order, rather than of private law, affecting as it does the whole province of Quebec and its inhabitants regarding the right to the practice of the profession of architects, etc., etc.\nDans L'Association des Architectes de la province de Qu\u00e9bec v. Ruddick 4, M. le Juge Rivard dit \u00e0 la page 80:\nOn ne peut pas douter que la loi des Architectes est une loi d'ordre public, et que l'action qui a pour objet d'appliquer aux contrevenants la peine pr\u00e9vue pour infraction \u00e0 cette loi, soit une action p\u00e9nale.\nCe dictum de M. le Juge Rivard dans la cause ci-dessus a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel dans une autre cause de L'Association des Architectes de la province de Qu\u00e9bec v. Perry 5.\nCitant Halsbury, 2\u00e8me \u00e9d. tome 7, No. 236, M. le Juge Pratte dans la pr\u00e9sente cause peut donc avec raison dire ce qui suit:\u2015-\nSur le premier point, deux raisons m'emp\u00eachent de me rendre \u00e0 l'opinion du premier juge. Je dirais d'abord qu'une loi qui d\u00e9fend un acte, et qui d\u00e9cr\u00e8te une peine pour assurer le respect de sa prohibition, doit \u00eatre tenue pour \u00eatre une loi d'ordre public.\nCette loi est non seulement une loi d'ordre public, mais elle est aussi une loi prohibitive comportant une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9. Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire, je crois, de faire une longue dissertation pour d\u00e9montrer qu'en principe les lois de ce genre emportent nullit\u00e9 quoiqu'elle n'y soit pas prononc\u00e9e. (C.C. 14) (Mignault, Vol. 1, p. 123). Le d\u00e9fendeur pouvait \u00e9videmment invoquer cette nullit\u00e9 et la faire constater par les tribunaux. Le contrat \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur une consid\u00e9ration ill\u00e9gale et contraire \u00e0 l'ordre public. Il ne peut lier les parties. (C.C. 989-990) (Vide Morel v. Morel 6, Verdun Auto Exchange v. Sauv\u00e9 7 ; Patenaude, Cari-gnan & Cie Lt\u00e9e v. Dover 8 ; Association St-Jean-Baptiste v. Brault 9 ; Brown v. Moore 10 ).\nCe que je viens de dire ne doit s'appliquer qu'\u00e0 la confection des plans et devis r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s, ce qui est la seule prohibition qui nous int\u00e9resse dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. Le demandeur en effet ne r\u00e9clame pas seulement pour la pr\u00e9paration des plans mais \u00e9galement pour la surveillance des travaux, et cette r\u00e9clamation se pr\u00e9sente sous un aspect diff\u00e9rent. Dans le premier cas, je suis d'opinion qu'il ne peut r\u00e9ussir et que l'appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu en partie, mais sur le second point, je crois qu'il est justifiable de r\u00e9clamer.\nLe privil\u00e8ge accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'architecte par la loi et dont ne jouit pas l'ing\u00e9nieur, est de pr\u00e9parer et fournir des plans r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s pour la construction d'un \u00e9difice. Mais la pr\u00e9paration des plans ne comprend pas n\u00e9cessairement la surveillance des travaux pour laquelle l'exclusivit\u00e9 n'est pas r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux architectes. Il est en effet toujours loisible, apr\u00e8s avoir fait pr\u00e9parer des plans par un architecte, de requ\u00e9rir les services d'un tiers, qu'il soit architecte ou non, pour surveiller les travaux moyennant r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Ce sont deux fonctions ind\u00e9pendantes et diff\u00e9rentes l'une de l'autre.\nL'appelant soutient au contraire que la surveillance des travaux est ancillaire au contrat de la pr\u00e9paration des plans, et que la nullit\u00e9 attach\u00e9e \u00e0 ce dernier vicie \u00e9galement le premier. Je ne puis accepter cette pr\u00e9tention. Il ne fait pas de doute qu'en certains cas, la nullit\u00e9 du contrat principal, qui existe \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat isol\u00e9 et par lui-m\u00eame, entra\u00eene la nullit\u00e9 du contrat accessoire, qui ne peut exister qu'en se rattachant \u00e0 ce m\u00eame contrat principal. Ainsi en est-il du contrat de gage, de cautionnement ou d'hypoth\u00e8que, greff\u00e9 \u00e0 un contrat de pr\u00eat: accessorium sequitur principale, (Planiol et Ripert, Vol. 6, No. 44; Mignault, Vol. 5, pages 187 et 188; Pothier, No. 14). La d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans l'Association St. Jean-Baptiste de Montr\u00e9al v. Brault 11 ne, peut servir de pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. Dans cette cause, les deux contrats \u00e9taient intimement li\u00e9s l'un \u00e0 l'autre, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9s pour servir une fin commune ill\u00e9gale, et l'un ne pouvait exister sans l'autre. Mais le cas qui nous occupe est enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rent. Il n'y a ni contrat principal ni contrat accessoire. L'intim\u00e9 a accept\u00e9 de remplir deux obligations entre lesquelles il n'y a pas de relation. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9 il existe un contrat pour la confection des plans dont la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration est interdite et un autre pour la surveillance des travaux pour laquelle la loi ne d\u00e9fend pas de recevoir des honoraires.\nDans ces conditions, la r\u00e9clamation est justifi\u00e9e en partie seulement. Comme le dit Larombi\u00e8re, (Th\u00e9orie des Obligations, Vol. 1, page 285) :\u2015\nSouvent plusieurs causes, dont l'une est licite et dont l'autre ne l'est pas, concourent dans la formation d'un engagement. Au. lieu de le maintenir ou de l'annuler pour le tout, les tribunaux doivent alors le restreindre \u00e0 la proportion correspondante \u00e0 la cause licite.\nDalloz, (Jurisprudence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale) 1890, 2\u00e8 partie, page 189:\u2015\nLorsqu'une vente valable et une vente nulle ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par le m\u00eame acte, mais sans lien n\u00e9cessaire entre elles, l'acte est valable pour une partie et nulle pour l'autre.\nCes autorit\u00e9s fran\u00e7aises sont semblables sur ce point \u00e0 la doctrine anglaise. En effet, la Cour de Division d'Angleterre dans Putsman v. Taylor 12 a approuv\u00e9 le jugement de Willes J. dans Pickering v. Ilfracombe Railway Co.13,. o\u00f9 il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9:\u2015\nWhere you cannot sever the illegal from the legal part of a covenant, the contract is altogether void; but where you can sever them, whether the illegality be created by statute or by the common law, you may reject the bad part and retain the good.\nAu m\u00eame volume, la Cour d'Appel d'Angleterre a rejet\u00e9 l'appel dans Putsman v. Taylor 14 mais n'a pas discut\u00e9 la question de s\u00e9paration des deux. contrats. Vide \u00e9galement The Bank of Australasia v. Breillat 15 :\nFrom Pigot's case (6 Cokes' Rep. 26), to the latest authorities, it has always been held that, when there are contained in the same instrument distinct engagements by which a party binds himself to do certain acts, some of which are legal, and some illegal, the performance of those which are legal may be enforced, though the performance of those which are illegal cannot.\nIl faut donc se garder de voir trop de d\u00e9pendance entre les clauses licites et les clauses illicites d'un contrat, quand entre elles il n'y a pas de liaison essentielle. Seules les clauses illicites s'effacent. Vitiantur et non vitiant. Les clauses licites demeurent et l'obligation ind\u00e9pendante ne s'\u00e9teint pas.\nLe compte total du demandeur-intim\u00e9 s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 $5,226.45, soit $2,508.05 pour la pr\u00e9paration des plans et devis, $1,589 pour la surveillance des travaux, $1,100 pour la modification aux plans et devis, et $29.40 pour d\u00e9bours\u00e9s et copies de plans. L'intim\u00e9 a re\u00e7u en acompte $1,050 qui doivent \u00eatre imput\u00e9s sur la pr\u00e9paration des plans \u00e9tant la dette la plus ancienne (C.C. 1161). Etant donn\u00e9 la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle je suis arriv\u00e9, il faut n\u00e9cessairement retrancher les item de $2,508.05 et $1,100 qui se rapportent \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration et \u00e0 la modification des plans, laissant un cr\u00e9dit en faveur de l'intim\u00e9 au montant de $1,618.40 qu'il a droit de r\u00e9clamer.\nL'appel doit donc \u00eatre accueilli en cons\u00e9quence, jugement devrait \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9 en faveur du demandeur-intim\u00e9 pour la somme de $1,618.40 plus les int\u00e9r\u00eats et les d\u00e9pens d'une action de cette classe en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Quant aux d\u00e9pens en Cour d'Appel et en cette Cour, \u00e0 cause des succ\u00e8s d\u00e9vis\u00e9s, j'accorderais au d\u00e9fendeur-appelant la moiti\u00e9 de ses frais tax\u00e9s.\nThe dissenting judgment of Rand and Kellock JJ. was delivered by:\u2015\nKellock J.:,\u2015This appeal is from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province of Quebec 16 dismissing by a majority, an appeal from the judgment at trial in favour of the respondent, the plaintiff, in an action to recover certain fees and disbursements in respect of the preparation of plans and specifications and the supervision of the erection of a store building for the appellant. The defence, which the learned trial judge and the majority in the court below rejected, is based upon the contention that the respondent, a professional engineer, was precluded by virtue of The Architects Act, R.S.Q., 1941, c. 272, from recovery.\nThe view which has so far prevailed is that The Architects Act is a statute passed purely in the interests of architects and, therefore, not one upon which the respondent can rely. Galipeault C.J., and Pratte J., who dissented, were, however, of opinion that the statute is one of public order, but both of the learned dissenting judges considered, notwithstanding, that the respondent was not barred in respect of his claim for supervision and for such part of the plans as related to foundations, structural steel, as well as the heating, electrical and plumbing systems.\nThe Architects Act was first enacted by 54 Vict., c. 59, the preamble to which reads as follows:\nWhereas it is deemed expedient for the better protection of the public interests in the erection of public and private buildings in the Province of Quebec, and in order to enable persons requiring professional aid in architecture, to distinguish between qualified and unqualified architects, and to ensure a standard of efficiency in the persons practising the profession of architecture in the Province, and for the furtherance and advancement of the art of architecture;\nIt cannot be contended, in my opinion, in the face of this preamble that the statute is other than one of public order. I do not think that the character of the statute can be affected by the fact that the preamble was dropped in later revisions. I therefore agree with the learned dissenting judges in their view of the statute, which was also the view of Rivard J., in Association des Architectes de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec v. Ruddick 17.\nI would in any event be of opinion that a statute of the character here in question is one of public order importing nullity into all contracts made in breach of it; Art. 14, 984, 990; Brown v. Moore 18 ; Major v. C.P.R.19.\nIt is provided by s. 12 that\nNo person, unless he be a landscape architect, shall take or make use of the name or title of architect, either singly or in connection with any other word, name, title or designation, nor act as such either directly or indirectly, unless he be registered as a member of the Association. Any person who, although not being registered as a member of the said Association, takes or makes use of any such name, title or designation, or acts as an architect or furnishes, for remuneration, plans or specifications to construct or remodel buildings, either directly or indirectly, shall be liable to a fine \u2026\nThis is subject to the proviso that\nNothing in this section shall be interpreted as affecting in any manner whatsoever the rights and privileges conferred by law upon the members of the Corporation of Professional Engineers of Quebec.\nThe reference is to c. 270 of the Revised Statutes, s. 2, s-s. (.4) of which provides that\nThe expression 'civil engineer' means any one who acts or practises as an engineer in advising on, in making measurements for, or in laying out, designing or supervising the construction of railways, \"metallic bridges, wooden bridges the cost of which exceeds six hundred dollars, public highways requiring engineering knowledge and experience, roads, canals, harbors, river improvements, lighthouses, and hydraulic, electrical, mechanical, municipal or other engineering works, not including government colonization roads or ordinary roads in rural municipalities; but does not apply to a mere skilled artisan or workman.\nR.S. 1925, c. 218, s. 2.\nSection 6 further provides that\nNo person shall be entitled, within the Province, to use the title of civil engineer, or any abbreviation thereof, or any name, title or description implying that he is a corporate member of the said Corporation, or to act or practise as civil engineer within the meaning of section 2, unless he is a corporate member of the Corporation or becomes such under the provisions of this act.\nR.S. 1925, c. 218, s. 6.\nIt is apparent from the character of the building here in question that the rights of the parties to this appeal are unaffected by the provisions of c 270. I cannot accept the contention that the absence of a section in c. 272 similar to s. 16 of c. 270, expressly prohibiting an action for professional fees by anyone not entitled under the statute, affects the construction which, in my opinion, as already stated, should be given to c. 272: Patenaude v. Dover 20 ; Bourque v. Timmis 21.\nI am unable, with respect, to concur in the view of the minority in the court below that, notwithstanding the plain language of s. 12 of c. 272, with respect to the furnishing of \"plans or specifications to construct or remodel buildings\", nevertheless if such plans and specifications cover such things as foundations, steel work, heating, electrical and plumbing systems, recovery may, nonetheless, be had with respect to these matters on the basis of quantum meruit. Such a view would reduce the effect of the statute to very small proportions but, in any event, in my opinion, with respect, there is nothing in either statute which lends support to such a construction.\nAs to the claim for supervision, while the appellant does not contend that no one but an architect is entitled to supervise the erection of a building according to plans and specifications which have been prepared by an architect, he does contend that the illegality with which the contract here in question is tainted operates to preclude any recovery under it at all. Stated another way, the contention is that to permit recovery by a person in respect of supervision according to plans and specifications made by him in direct violation of the law would be, in fact, to give such plans and specifications an efficacy which the law prohibits. In my view this contention is sound.\nIn L'Association St. Jean-Baptiste v. Brault 22, a subsequent agreement was declared invalid on the ground that the invalidity of a prior agreement \"vitiates the other collateral or auxiliary agreement springing from it;\" per Tas-chereau J., in delivering the judgment of the majority at p. 606. Among the authorities to which reference is made is a judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States, in Armstrong v. Toler 23, per Marshall C.J. approving of an instruction 'by the trial judge to the jury as follows, at p. 261 :\nI understand the rule, as now clearly settled, to be, that where the contract grows immediately out of, and is connected with, an illegal or immoral act, a Court of Justice will not lend its aid to enforce it.\nThe. learned judge went on to say :\nAnd if the contract be in part only connected with the illegal transaction, and growing immediately out of it, though it be, in fact, a new contract, it is equally tainted by it.\nAt p. 260 he had previously said :\nSo far as the rule operates to discourage the perpetration of an immoral or illegal act, it is founded in the strongest reason.\nIt is, of course, clear, for example, in the case of contracts in restraint of trade, which do not differ in this respect from other contracts, that if there be in an agreement a number of covenants, some legal and others illegal, the former are enforceable provided they are severable from the latter. The question is, however, as to what covenants are severable.\nAs stated by Salter J., in Putsman v. Taylor 24 :\nThe promise to be enforceable must be on the face of the document a separate promise, a separate compact, the subject of separate consideration and accord, the performance of which is independent of the performance of any other promises which the promisor may have made.\nThe learned judge cites from the judgment of Lord Sterndale, M.R., in Attwood v. Lamont 25 as follows:\n\u2026 a contract can be severed if the severed parts are independent of one another and can be severed without the severance affecting the meaning of the part remaining.\nIt was accordingly held in Putsman's case that the covenant in the agreement before the court that the defendant would not \"take service with any tailor in Snow Hill\" was independent of the other restrictive covenants and therefore severable.\nIn the case at bar the agreement is to pay 2\u00bd per cent for the preparation of the plans and another 2\u00bd per cent for the supervision of the erection of the building according to those plans. The latter promise is, therefore, dependent upon the carrying out of the first as it is obvious that the remuneration for supervising cannot be earned apart from the preparation of the plans. Had the respondent, after entering into the agreement here in question, refused to carry it out and been sued by the appellant for damages for breach, I think it clear that the appellant could have recovered neither with respect to plans nor supervision. With respect to his failure to prepare the plans, the respondent would have replied that he was prohibited from making them by law and could not, therefore, be liable in damages for his failure to carry out the agreement in that respect. With respect to the claim for breach of the agreement to supervise, the respondent's answer would have been that his only undertaking was to supervise the erection of a building according to plans to be prepared by him which, as already stated, he was prohibited from doing. It is obvious, therefore, that the agreement to supervise was not \"independent of the performance of any other promises\" which the respondent had made, to employ the language of Salter J. above, but was dependent on the performance of his promise with respect to the preparation of the plans.\nThe law is not differently stated in Dalloz J.D., 1890, deuxi\u00e8me partie, p. 189, as follows:\nLa vente d'une licence de tol\u00e9rance et du mobilier servant \u00e0 son exploitation est nulle (c. civ. 1128, 1131, 1133, 1598) (1) ;\nMais, au contraire, la vente de l'immeuble o\u00f9 la licence est exploit\u00e9e est valable, si l'usage de cet immeuble n'est pas, d'apr\u00e8s la convention des parties, indissolublement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'emploi de la licence vendue (c. civ. 1598 (2)).\nLorsqu'une vente valable et une vente nulle ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par le m\u00eame acte, mais sans lien n\u00e9cessaire entre elles, l'acte est valable pour une partie et nul pour l'autre (c. civ. 1131(3)).\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs throughout.\nCartwright J.:\u2015I agree with the reasons and the conclusion of my brother Taschereau and desire to add only a few words.\nWhen in one document a party binds himself to do more acts than one, some of which are legal and some illegal, the question whether the agreement to do the legal acts is severable and so enforceable is one of construction of the document. Severance, as was said by Salter J. in Putsman v. Taylor, referred to by my brother Taschereau, is the act of the parties not of the Court. The language of the document in the case at bar appears to me to express two separate agreements; and I am unable to accept the view that, since the agreement to prepare the plans of the building for remuneration was one which the statute forbad the respondent to make and was therefore rendered null, a separate agreement, the performance of which involved making use of such plans with knowledge of their origin, would be rendered invalid also.\nThe evidence makes it clear that at least $1,000 of the $1,050 paid by the appellant to the respondent was paid before the work of supervision was commenced. This circumstance indicates that the payment was made for the preparation of the plans as there was at the date of payment no other debt owing by the appellant to the respondent.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Taschereau.\nAppeal allowed in part.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Par\u00e9 & Daveluy.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Joseph Marineau.\n1 Q.R.

The Ontario Court of Appeal, Hogg J.A. dissenting, set the conviction aside on the ground that there was no evidence implicating the accused to go to the jury. The Crown appealed on the ground that the dissenting judgment was right in law.\nHeld: (Cartwright J. dissenting), that the appeal should be allowed and the order of the Court of Appeal set aside.\nHeld: also, (Kerwin J. dissenting), that an order should be made restoring the verdict of the jury.\nPer: Taschereau, Kellock and Fauteux JJ.: The suggestion that a difference as to the person appealing, i.e. the Crown, or an accused, calls for a distinction in law as to this court\u2019s powers find no support either in the enactments defining them, (the Criminal Code, s. 1024; the Supreme Court Act, s. 46), or in the judicial pronouncements interpreting such enactments, Manchuk v. the King [1938] S.C.R. 341 at 349; Savard and Lizotte v. the King [1946] S.C.R. 20 at 33, 39; Lizotte v. the King [1951] S.C.R. 115. Since it does not appear that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable and this court being in as good a position to decide that question as the court below, it should, consonant with the diligence required in the proper administration of justice, do so.\nPer: Kerwin J. (dissenting in part). The dissent was on the question of law\u2014whether, there was any evidence to go to the jury. Hogg J.A. was right in holding there was, but the majority of the Court having decided the contrary, did not determine the question raised in the respondent\u2019s notice of appeal, that even if there was such evidence the verdict should be set aside as unreasonable. It had the authority to do so whereas the jurisdiction of this court is strictly limited and the situation on an appeal by the Crown is different from that when the accused is the appellant and, therefore, the decision in Fraser v. the King [1936] S.C.R. 296 is not applicable. An order should therefore go that the case be remitted to the Court of Appeal in order that it may, if leave be given, pass upon the point, the only one upon which the respondent is entitled to its decision.\nCartwright J. dissenting, entertained doubts as to the jurisdiction of this court, as it seemed to him implicit in the reasons of the majority of the Court of Appeal, that they had held the conviction ought to be set aside under s. 1014(1) (a) of the Criminal Code, a ground of fact or of mixed fact and law. Dealing with the matter however on the assumption that the sole ground of the decision of the majority of the Court of Appeal was that there was no evidence to go to the jury and that the ground of dissent was that there was, he would have dismissed the appeal.\nAPPEAL by the Crown pursuant to the provisions of s. 1023 (3) of the Criminal Code from the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal[1], Hogg J.A. dissenting, which allowed the appeal of the accused from his conviction and directed an acquittal.\nC.P. Hope, Q.C. for the appellant.\nC.F. Scott for the respondent.\nKERWIN J.: (dissenting in part):\u2014After a joint trial with a jury, the respondent McKay, and Wood and Quinlan were convicted of having unlawfully assaulted a person with intent to rob. Wood did not appeal and on the appeal of McKay and Quinlan, counsel for the Crown admitted that there was no evidence to connect the latter with the offence charged, and the Court of Appeal therefore allowed his appeal and set aside his conviction. Judgment on McKay\u2019s appeal was reserved and ultimately the Court of Appeal by its judgment set aside his conviction and directed an acquittal with Hogg J.A. dissenting. From that judgment the Crown appeals.\nHaving considered the reasons for judgment of the majority, delivered by Laidlaw J.A., and those of the dissenting judge, I am of opinion that the dissent is on the question of law whether there was any evidence to go to the jury. I also conclude that Hogg J.A. was right in holding that there was legal evidence against the present respondent upon which the jury were entitled to find the respondent guilty.\nIn an appeal by the Crown to this Court an accused may raise the other grounds of law taken by him before the Court of Appeal. The respondent argued that he was at least entitled to a new trial because of alleged defects in the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury but I think there was no such defect. The trial judge put it to the jury as to whether the respondent had access to the \u201chide\u201d or secret closet, and in my opinion that was sufficient without the necessity of referring to the question of possession of the \u201chide\u201d. It was also contended that the trial judge had charged the jury that the Crown had proven beyond any doubt that the signatures which appear on some of certain writings were McKay\u2019s signatures. This is based upon the absence in the transcript of the word \u201cno\u201d but, in any event it is quite clear from what immediately follows that the trial judge was not saying that to the jury but in fact something diametrically opposite. Finally, there is no substance in the argument that the trial judge failed to deal adequately with the case against the respondent as distinct from the case against Wood. The appeal should therefore be allowed and the order of the Court of Appeal set aside.\nHowever, in his notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal the respondent asked leave to appeal on questions of fact. After deciding that there was no evidence to go to the jury, the Court of Appeal did not proceed to determine that, even if there was evidence, the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it was unreasonable. They had the authority so to do but our jurisdiction is strictly limited. In considering the proper order to be made on an appeal by the Crown, the situation is far different from that when the accused is the appellant and, therefore, in my opinion the decision in Fraser v. The King[2], is not applicable, even though, here as there, the evidence against the accused be purely circumstantial. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the respondent\u2019s application to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal on questions of fact was granted, and the proper judgment appears to me to be to remit the case to that Court in order that it may, if leave had been given, or will be given, pass upon the question as to whether the verdict was unreasonable in the light of all the evidence. That is the only point upon which the respondent will have a right to a decision of the Court of Appeal.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Kellock and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014For the reasons given by my brother Kerwin, I agree that the appeal of the Attorney General should be allowed and the order of the Court of Appeal set aside.\nWith respect, however, to the order to be then made by this Court, I think that the verdict of the jury should be restored. As to authority to make such an order, I have no doubt. The relevant terms of s. 1024 of the Criminal Code and of s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act are:\u2014\n1024:\u2014The Supreme Court of Canada shall make such rule or order thereon, either in affirmance of a conviction or for granting a new trial, or otherwise\u2026 as the justice of the case requires.\n46:\u2014The Court may\u2026 give the judgment\u2026 which the court whose decision is appealed against, should have given\u2026\nIn Manchuk v. The King[3], Sir Lyman Duff, delivering the judgment of the majority, said at page 349:\u2014\nThere remains for consideration the grave question as to the order that ought to be made by this Court. We have concluded, after full consideration, that, by force of section 1024, coupled with the enactments of the Supreme Court Act, this Court has authority, not only to order a new trial, or to quash the conviction and direct the discharge of the prisoner, but also to give the judgment which the Court of Appeal for Ontario was empowered to give in virtue of s. 1016(2);\nIn Savard and Lizotte v. The King[4], Taschereau J., speaking for the majority, stated at page 33:\u2014\nLa question de droit qui donne juridiction \u00e0 cette Cour, qui en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 la saisit du litige, est formul\u00e9e par la Cour du Banc du Roi, mais le rem\u00e8de qui doit \u00eatre apport\u00e9, quand elle est jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, est du ressort de cette Cour, qui peut et doit alors rendre l\u2019ordonnance que requiert la justice. (Manchuk v. The King3).\nThe view of Kellock J., on the point, is thus expressed at page 49:\u2014\nWhile the existence of a dissent on a question of law, as provided by section 1023, is a condition precedent for an appeal to this Court, in a case like the present, this Court, once seized of the appeal is not limited to the remedy considered appropriate in the dissent, but has complete jurisdiction to direct the remedy which, in its opinion, the Court appealed from ought to have granted.\nIn Lizotte v. The King[5], Cartwright J., delivering the judgment of the Court, said at the bottom of page 135:\u2014\nIn my opinion, once this court reaches the conclusion, on one or more of the points properly before it, that there has been error in law below it is unfettered in deciding what order should be made by the views expressed in the Court of Appeal.\nIt is true that in each of these cases, the appeal, contrary to what is the situation in the present instance, was entered by the accused and not by the Crown. But the suggestion that this difference as to the person appealing calls for a distinction in law as to the powers of this Court finds, in my respectful view, no support, either in the enactments defining them or in the above judicial pronouncements interpreting such enactments.\nAs to the appropriateness of this order in the present case, I am equally satisfied. The initial question which this Court had affirmatively to answer in order to reach the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed, was whether, contrary to the view of the majority in the Court below, there was, in the record, legal evidence upon which a jury was entitled to find the respondent guilty. The evidence being wholly circumstantial, the question, in the light of the classical direction to the jury as laid down by Alderson B., in the Hodge\u2019s case[6], was, more precisely, whether a jury could be satisfied \u201cnot only that those circumstances were consistent with his having committed the act, but also that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person.\u201d\nIn the consideration of the question, the reasonableness of a verdict of guilty based upon such evidence is not, to say the least, a foreign matter. On an exhaustive review of the evidence, it does not appear that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable.\nIn this view, it would not, in my opinion, be consonant with the diligence required in the proper administration of justice in criminal matters to return this case to the Court of Appeal in order that it may pass on that question, i.e., whether the verdict is unreasonable, which this Court is in as good a position as the former to determine.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the verdict of the jury restored.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The respondent was tried jointly with one Woods and one Quinlan before Le Bel J. and a jury and all three were convicted on the charge that \u201con or about the 12th of November, 1952, being armed with offensive weapons, they did unlawfully assault Gordon Robinson, an employee of the Canadian Bank of Commerce with intent to rob him of the property of the Bank then in his charge or custody as such employee;\u201d The respondent and Quinlan appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. Counsel for the Crown stated that in his opinion there was not sufficient evidence to support the verdict against Quinlan and the Court of Appeal being of the same opinion thereupon allowed his appeal and directed his acquittal. The Court later delivered judgment in the case of the respondent allowing his appeal and directing his acquittal. Hogg J.A., dissenting, would have dismissed the appeal.\nIt is common ground that the evidence against the respondent was wholly circumstantial. During the argument I entertained doubts as to our jurisdiction, which have not been completely dispelled, as it seemed to me to be implicit in the reasons of the majority, delivered by Laidlaw J.A. and concurred in by Mackay J.A. that in their opinion the conviction ought to be set aside under s. 1014(1) (a) of the Criminal Code, that this ground was one of fact or of mixed fact and law, and would not be invalidated by reason of its being held, as was done by Hogg J.A., that there was sufficient evidence for the consideration of the jury to justify the refusal of the learned trial judge to direct a verdict of acquittal.\nAs, however, the majority of this Court are of opinion that we have jurisdiction, I propose to deal with the matter on the assumption that, as was argued by counsel for the appellant, the sole ground of the decision of the majority of the Court of Appeal was that there was no evidence to go to the jury and that the ground of dissent was that there was such evidence. It is too late to question the rule that whether or not there is any evidence (as distinguished from sufficient evidence) to support a verdict is a question of law.\nOn this assumption, I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nThe learned counsel for the Crown at the trial made it clear in his opening address that he was proceeding on the theory that there was evidence from which the jury could properly find that, shortly after the robbery, the respondent was, jointly with Woods, in possession of certain articles of a highly incriminating nature (the most important being a key taken from the bank during the robbery) which were found by the Police in \u201ca hide\u201d reached through a concealed door in a closet opening off a room in the flat of which Woods was the tenant. As I read the reasons of the Court of Appeal the real difference between the view of the majority and that of Hogg J.A. was as to whether there was evidence from which the jury could infer that the respondent had joint possession of such articles.\nAfter reviewing the relevant evidence Laidlaw J.A. says in part:\u2014\nThere was no evidence that he (the respondent) had any rights of access to that hide, and no evidence from which it could be found that he had possession or the right of possession, jointly or otherwise, to it.\nAfter a similar review Hogg J.A. says in part:\u2014\nThe question before this Court is whether the circumstances which I have outlined, furnished any evidence from which the jury could draw an inference that the appellant had joint possession with Woods of the aforesaid articles.\nThe learned Justice of Appeal goes on to decide that there was evidence from which the jury could draw such inference.\nI do not think that any useful purpose would be served by my again reviewing the evidence. After a careful consideration of all of it I find myself in agreement with the conclusions of the majority in the Court of Appeal (i) that there was no evidence from which the jury could infer that the respondent had possession of the incriminating articles in \u201cthe hide\u201d, and (ii) that, lacking the basis for such a finding of possession, the other circumstances relied upon by the Crown could not be found to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused was guilty.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal allowed and verdict of jury restored.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.C.

Before the unpaid balance had become due, G., the conditional purchaser, sold the truck as a used car to the respondent without the knowledge of the appellant. G. was a garage operator, and although a trader in similar articles he was not a licenced dealer within the meaning of s. 21 of the Motor Vehicles Act-, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 142.\nThe trial judge held the sale invalid because it had been made in contravention of s. 21. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, held the sale valid because s. 21 applied only to the sale of stolen vehicles and it had not been established that the truck had been stolen.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the action maintained.\nPer Taschereau, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: It was sufficiently alleged and established that at the moment of its sale to the respondent the truck was stolen from the appellant. Consequently, since the person from whom the respondent purchased it was not a licenced dealer, the respondent was deprived, by virtue of s. 21, of the protection given by Art. 1489 of the Civil Code.\nPer Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: S. 21 does not deprive the purchaser in the case of the sale of a thing belonging to another in a commercial matter of the protection given by Art. 1488 of the Code, but only precludes the application of Art. 1489 of the Code in the case of the sale of a stolen vehicle by a dealer.\nPer Rand and Estey JJ.: S. 21 effects a modification of both Arts. 1488 and 1489 of the Civil Code in respect to motor vehicles.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, reversing, St. Jacques and Marchand JJ.A. dissenting, the trial judgment which bad held that the sale of the truck was invalid.

Gagnon, tous droits lui r\u00e9sultant d'un contrat de vente conditionnel intervenu le m\u00eame jour et suivant lequel elle vendait ce camion \u00e0 Gagnon. La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que, moins d'un mois apr\u00e8s ces conventions, Gagnon se d\u00e9partit de ce camion pour le. vendre \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 alors que, manifestement, il n'avait aucun droit de ce faire,\u2015se rendant ainsi coupable de vol, suivant la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelante,\u2015et alors aussi que, bien qu'en fait, commer\u00e7ant en semblables mati\u00e8res, il n'\u00e9tait pas muni d'une licence pour faire ce commerce, tel que requis par l'article 21 de la Loi des v\u00e9hicules moteurs, S.R.Q. (1941) ch. 142. Bref, l'appelante invoque son titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, les dispositions de l'article 1487 (C.C.) posant le principe de la nullit\u00e9 de la vente de la chose d'autrui, et pr\u00e9tend que l'intim\u00e9, \u00e0 raison du fait qu'il acheta ce camion d'une personne non licenci\u00e9e, a pendu et la protection de l'article 1488 et celle de l'article 1489.\nD'autre part, l'intim\u00e9 soumet (i) que les dispositions de l'article 21 n'affectent pas l'op\u00e9ration de l'article 1488 et (ii) que, s'il faut reconna\u00eetre qu'elles affectent celles de l'article 1489,\u2015ainsi qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par cette Cour dans Home Fire and Marine Insurance Co. v.

La vente de la chose qui n'appartient pas au vendeur est nulle, sauf les exceptions contenues dans les trois articles qui suivent. L'acheteur peut recouvrer des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats du vendeur, s'il ignorait que la chose n'appartenait pas \u00e0 ce dernier.\n1488. La vente est valide s'il s'agit d'une affaire commerciale, ou si le vendeur devient ensuite propri\u00e9taire de la chose.\n1489. Si une chose perdue ou vol\u00e9e est achet\u00e9e de bonne foi, dans une foire, march\u00e9 ou \u00e0 une vente publique, ou d'un commer\u00e7ant trafiquant en semblables mati\u00e8res, le propri\u00e9taire ne peut la revendiquer sans rembourser \u00e0 l'acheteur le prix qu'il en a pay\u00e9.\n1490. Si la chose perdue ou vol\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue sous l'autorit\u00e9 de la loi, elle ne peut \u00eatre revendiqu\u00e9e.\nL'article 1487 ne demande pas d'explication; et l'article 1490 n'a ici aucune application.\nAux articles 1488 et 1489, il faut apporter le compl\u00e9ment que le premier re\u00e7oit du paragraphe 3 et, le second, des paragraphes 3 et 4 de l'article 2268:\u2015\n2268. La possession actuelle d'un meuble corporel \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire fait pr\u00e9sumer le juste titre. C'est au r\u00e9clamant \u00e0 prouver, outre son droit, les vices de la possession et du titre du possesseur qui invoque la prescription ou qui en est dispens\u00e9 d'ap\u00e8s les dispositions du pr\u00e9sent article.\nLa prescription des meubles corporels a lieu par trois ans \u00e0 compter de la d\u00e9possession en faveur du possesseur de bonne foi, m\u00eame si cette d\u00e9possession a eu lieu par vol.\nCette prescription n'est cependant pas n\u00e9cessaire pour emp\u00eacher la revendication si la chose a \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9e de bonne foi dans une foire, march\u00e9, ou \u00e0 une vente publique, ou d'un commer\u00e7ant trafiquant en semblables mati\u00e8res, (ni en affaire de commerce en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) ; sauf l'exception contenue au paragraphe qui suit.\nN\u00e9anmoins la chose perdue ou vol\u00e9e peut \u00eatre revendiqu\u00e9e tant que la prescription n'est pas acquise, quoiqu'elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9e de bonne foi dans les cas du paragraphe qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de; mais dans ces cas la revendication ne peut avoir lieu qu'en remboursant \u00e0 l'acheteur le prix qu'il a pay\u00e9.\nLa revendication n'a lieu dans aucun cas si la chose a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue sous l'autorit\u00e9 de la loi. P. 668.\nLe voleur ou autre possesseur violent ou clandestin, et leurs successeurs \u00e0 titre universel sont emp\u00each\u00e9s de prescrire par les articles 2197 et 2198.\nLes articles 1488 et 1489 couvrent\u2015entre autres cas\u2015tous les deux, le cas de la vente de la chose d'autrui, en mati\u00e8re commerciale, par un trafiquant en semblables mati\u00e8res. Sans une distinction sur la port\u00e9e respective de ces deux articles, il y aurait l\u00e0, non seulement une r\u00e9p\u00e9tition inutile, mais\" contradiction, puisque le premier, validant la vente de la chose d'autrui, n'autorise pas, comme le second, la revendication de cette chose par le propri\u00e9taire d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par la vente. Manifeste \u00e0 la lecture m\u00eame de ces deux dispositions, cette distinction est ainsi marqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l'extrait suivant du Trait\u00e9 de droit commercial de Perrault, tome 2, page 84, No. 631:\u2015\n631. Cas d'une chose (n'appartenant pas au vendeur, mais qui n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 ni perdue, ni vol\u00e9e) : D'apr\u00e8s 1488 et 2268 (parag. 3) est valide l'ali\u00e9nation de la chose d'autrui, si cette chose constitue l'objet (a) d'une vente faite par un commer\u00e7ant \u00e0 un autre commer\u00e7ant, (b) d'une vente par un commer\u00e7ant \u00e0 un non-commer\u00e7ant, (c) d'une vente par un non-commer\u00e7ant \u00e0 un commer\u00e7ant. Et si l'objet n'\u00e1 \u00e9t\u00e9 ni perdu, ni vol\u00e9, l'acqu\u00e9reur n'en peut \u00eatre d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9 m\u00eame sur remboursement du prix.\nCas d'une chose perdue ou vol\u00e9e:\nD'apr\u00e8s les arts. 1489 et 2268 (parags. 3 et 4) sera valide la vente d'une chose perdue ou vol\u00e9e faite dans une foire, un march\u00e9, \u00e0 une vente publique ou par un commer\u00e7ant trafiquant en semblables mati\u00e8res ou en affaires de commerce en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, mais le propri\u00e9taire qui avait perdu cette chose ou auquel on l'avait vol\u00e9e pourra en recouvrer la possession en remboursant \u00e0 l'acheteur le prix qu'il en a pay\u00e9.\nAinsi donc, de bonne foi et dans le cours normal de son commerce, un marchand vend une chose, dont il n'est pas propri\u00e9taire pour l'unique raison que son droit de propri\u00e9taire est assujetti \u00e0 une condition suspensive non encore satisfaite. Il vend la chose d'autrui et le cas est r\u00e9gl\u00e9 par l'article 1488. Mais si cette chose ne lui appartient pas parce que vol\u00e9e ou si, quoique l\u00e9galement en possession d'icelle, mais sachant qu'elle appartient \u00e0 autrui, qu'il n'a pas le droit de s'en d\u00e9partir et de la vendre, et la vole en ce faisant, le cas est r\u00e9gl\u00e9 par l'article 1489. Dans le cas de vente d'une chose vol\u00e9e, c'est l'article 1489 qui s'applique \u00e0 l'exclusion de la disposition pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente.\nSomme toute, assumant en l'esp\u00e8ce la bonne foi de l'intim\u00e9, le sort de la vente \u00e0 lui faite par Gagnon devrait, sous le droit commun, \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9 par les dispositions de l'article 1488 ou celles de l'article 1489 suivant que le camion ainsi achet\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait un camion non vol\u00e9 ou qu'il \u00e9tait un camion vol\u00e9.\nCette distinction entre l'application propre \u00e0 chacun de ces deux articles de la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le L\u00e9gislateur, en \u00e9dictant, dans la Loi des v\u00e9hicules moteurs, des dispositions d'exception relatives \u00e0 ce commerce, est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 en avoir tenu compte. A la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et comme nous allons le voir, le texte m\u00eame de ces dispositions d'exception manifeste qu'en les \u00e9dictant, le L\u00e9gislateur avait en vue les dispositions de l'article 1489 et non celles de l'article pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent.\nCet article 21 de la Loi des v\u00e9hicules moteurs est divis\u00e9 en trois paragraphes. Les parties pertinentes du premier sont les suivantes:\u2015\n21. 1. Il est d\u00e9fendu \u00e0 toute personne de faire le commerce de v\u00e9hicules automobiles, \u00e0 moins d'avoir obtenu du bureau une licence \u00e0 cet effet, sur paiement au bureau- de l'honoraire suivant:\u2015\n.......................................................................................................................................\n.......................................................................................................................................\nCette licence ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9mise avant que la personne qui la demande ait fourni au bureau un cautionnement \u00e0 l'effet de garantir au propri\u00e9taire d'un v\u00e9hicule automobile vol\u00e9, vendu par elle, le remboursement du prix que ce propri\u00e9taire a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 tout acheteur de ce v\u00e9hicule automobile pour en recouvrer la possession sur revendication comme chose vol\u00e9e. Dans ce cas, le propri\u00e9taire a le droit de r\u00e9clamer en son nom, du commer\u00e7ant et de sa caution, le prix qu'il a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 l'acheteur.\n.......................................................................................................................................\nN'est pas cens\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par un commer\u00e7ant trafiquant en v\u00e9hicules automobiles toute vente d'un v\u00e9hicule automobile faite par une personne qui n'est pas licenci\u00e9e sous l'autorit\u00e9 du pr\u00e9sent paragraphe.\nLes dispositions du paragraphe 2, qu'il est utile de reproduire pour l'interpr\u00e9tation de tout l'article, prescrivent:\u2015\n2. Il est d\u00e9fendu \u00e0 toute personne d'offrir en vente ou de vendre un v\u00e9hicule automobile dans une foire, un march\u00e9, \u00e0 l'encan ou \u00e0 une vente publique autre que celle faite sous l'autorit\u00e9 de la loi, \u00e0 moins que cette personne n'ait: a) Fourni au bureau un cautionnement \u00e0 l'effet de garantir \u00e0 son acheteur qu'il est le propri\u00e9taire de ce v\u00e9hicule automobile, et aussi \u00e0 l'effet de garantir au propri\u00e9taire d'un v\u00e9hicule automobile vol\u00e9, vendu par elle, le remboursement du prix que ce propri\u00e9taire a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 tout acheteur de ce v\u00e9hicule automobile pour en recouvrer la possession sur revendication comme chose vol\u00e9e. Dans ce cas, le propri\u00e9taire a le droit de r\u00e9clamer en son nom, du commer\u00e7ant et de sa caution, le prix qu'il a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 l'acheteur; et b) Obtenu du bureau un permis de vendre publiquement ce v\u00e9hicule automobile suivant l'une des mani\u00e8res susindiqu\u00e9es ; et c) Livr\u00e9 ce permis \u00e0 son acheteur.\n\u00c9cartant, pour l'instant, la consid\u00e9ration de la disposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, apparaissant au d\u00e9but du paragraphe 1 de l'article 21, laquelle d\u00e9fend \u00e0 toute personne de faire le commerce de v\u00e9hicules automobiles sans \u00eatre munie d'un permis, l'examen des autres dispositions pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es \u00e9tablit ce qui suit:\u2015 (i) Les ventes couvertes, tant par le cautionnement requis au paragraphe 1 (vente, par un commer\u00e7ant, d'un v\u00e9hicule vol\u00e9) que par celui exig\u00e9 sous le paragraphe 2 (vente dans une foire, un march\u00e9, \u00e0 l'encan, ou vente pub- lique autre que celle faite sous l'autorit\u00e9 de la loi), sont exactement et exclusivement les ventes sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9es \u00e0 l'article 1489. (ii) Au paragraphe 1, le L\u00e9gislateur n'a pas dit \"N'est pas cens\u00e9e \u00eatre une vente en mati\u00e8re commerciale \u2026\",\u2015ce qui aurait affect\u00e9 les cas couverts par l'article 1488\u2015, mais \"N'est pas cens\u00e9e avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par un commer\u00e7ant trafiquant en v\u00e9hicules automobiles \u2026\", enlevant par l\u00e0 une des conditions n\u00e9cessaires, en l'esp\u00e8ce, au jeu de l'article 1489. (iii) Enfin, alors que le cautionnement exig\u00e9 pour l'obtention d'une licence autorisant \u00e0 faire le commerce de v\u00e9hicules automobiles est suffisant s'il garantit au propri\u00e9taire d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par vol le remboursement de ce que ce dernier doit d\u00e9bourser pour revendiquer son v\u00e9hicule \"comme vol\u00e9\", le cautionnement conditionnant l'\u00e9mission d'un permis pour faire l'une des ventes publiques mentionn\u00e9es au paragraphe 2, doit, en plus de cette garantie donn\u00e9e au propri\u00e9taire d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par le vol, assurer \u00e0 l'acheteur du v\u00e9hicule alors vendu, que le vendeur en est le propri\u00e9taire.\nEn somme, en adoptant les dispositions du paragraphe 1, le L\u00e9gislateur\u2015et c'est l\u00e0 la substance v\u00e9ritable de toute la disposition\u2015a, d'une part, ajout\u00e9 au droit commun en pourvoyant une protection additionnelle au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du propri\u00e9taire d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par le vol et, d'autre part, a soustrait au droit commun en enlevant \u00e0 celui qui ach\u00e8te, d'un commer\u00e7ant non licenci\u00e9, une voiture vol\u00e9e, le droit d'exiger du propri\u00e9taire la revendiquant \"comme vol\u00e9e, le remboursement du prix qu'il a pay\u00e9. Mais, ni express\u00e9ment, ni implicitement, le L\u00e9gislateur a-t-il, par ces dispositions du paragraphe 1 de l'article 21, touch\u00e9 le cas de vente, en mati\u00e8re commerciale, d'une automobile non vol\u00e9e. Sur ce point, la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n'est pas chang\u00e9e; cette vente \u00e9tant valid\u00e9e par le L\u00e9gislateur sous l'article 1488, l'acheteur n'a pas besoin de garantie de son vendeur; et quant au propri\u00e9taire d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9 en pareil cas, le paragraphe 1 de l'article 21 n'ajoute rien au recours que lui donne le droit commun contre ce commer\u00e7ant de bonne foi.\nComment assurer que ces dispositions de substance du paragraphe 1 de l'article 21 soient effectivement observ\u00e9es, que le cautionnement soit fourni, \u00e0 moins que ce commerce particulier ne soit plac\u00e9 sous contr\u00f4le par une prohibition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale emp\u00eachant toute personne de le faire sans \u00eatre pr\u00e9alablement munie d'une licence, et en assujettissant l'\u00e9mission de cette licence \u00e0 l'existence d'un cautionnement actuellement donn\u00e9. C'est l\u00e0, je crois, l'esprit v\u00e9ritable et l'unique raison de la prohibition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale apparaissant au d\u00e9but du paragraphe 1.\nMais, dit l'appelante, cette prohibition d\u00e9fend \u00e0 toute personne \"de faire le commerce de v\u00e9hicules automobiles \u2026\" et non pas \"de faire le commerce de v\u00e9hicules automobiles vol\u00e9es \u2026\". Le commerce des v\u00e9hicules vol\u00e9s n'avait pas \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9fendu, il l'\u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0; et l'on s'imagine mal le L\u00e9gislateur accordant des licences pour l'autoriser. Sans doute, la prohibition couvre le commerce de tout v\u00e9hicule automobile; mais il lui fallait cette g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 pour assurer le contr\u00f4le n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ration de ces dispositions substantives de la loi.\nMais l'appelante, invoquant le paragraphe 14 de l'article 2 du Code Civil, a pr\u00e9tendu que toute vente faite en violation de la prohibition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, est absolument nulle. Si le L\u00e9gislateur entendait, par cette prohibition, frapper de nullit\u00e9 toutes les ventes faites par un commer\u00e7ant non licenci\u00e9, il ne lui \u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de dire, dans le m\u00eame paragraphe, que \"telle vente n'\u00e9tait pas cens\u00e9e avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par un commer\u00e7ant trafiquant en v\u00e9hicules automobiles \u2026\"\nLes principes d'interpr\u00e9tation formul\u00e9s dans Maxwell, On Interpretation of Statutes, 9e \u00e9dition, page 84, sont ici pertinents:\u2015\nPresumption against Implicit Alteration of law.\nOne of these presumptions is that the Legislature does not intend to make any substantial alteration in the law beyond what it explicitly declares, either in express terms or by clear implication, or, in other words, beyond the immediate scope and object of the statute. In all general matters outside those limits the law remains undisturbed. It is in the last degree improbable that the Legislature would overthrow fundamental principles, infringe rights, or depart from the general system of law, without expressing its intention with irresistible clearness, and to give any such effect to general words, simply because they have a meaning that would lead thereto when used in either their widest, their usual, or their natural sense, would be to give them a meaning other than that which was actually intended. General words and phrases, therefore, however wide and comprehensive they may be in their literal sense, must, usually, be construed as being limited to the actual objects of the Act.\nEnfin, et en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, il faut ajouter que la cause de Home Fire and Marine Insurance Co. v. Baptist (supra) ne d\u00e9cide pas que celui qui ach\u00e8te un v\u00e9hicule non vol\u00e9, d'un commer\u00e7ant non licenci\u00e9, perd la protection de l'article 1488. Cette question n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e et n'avait pas \u00e0 l'\u00eatre dans cette cause o\u00f9 il s'agissait d'une automobile vol\u00e9e. Cette Cour, appr\u00e9ciant l'effet du paragraphe 1 de l'article 21, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9:\u2015\nLe but \u00e9vident est d'emp\u00eacher l'application de l'article 1489 du Code et, en pareil cas, d'\u00e9liminer l'obligation du propri\u00e9taire, en revendiquant la machine qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 vol\u00e9e, de \"rembourser \u00e0 l'acheteur le prix qu'il en a pay\u00e9\".\nIl faut donc conclure au bien-fond\u00e9 de la premi\u00e8re proposition de l'intime et dire que le paragraphe 1 de l'article 21 n'enl\u00e8ve pas la protection que l'article 1488 donne \u00e0 l'acheteur dans le cas de la vente de la chose d'autrui en mati\u00e8re commerciale.\nReconnaissant que l'article 21 affecte, cependant, les dispositions de l'article 1489, l'intim\u00e9 soumet, comme deuxi\u00e8me proposition, que dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, le vol de l'automobile n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 aux plaidoiries et n'est pas \u00e9tabli par la preuve.\nLes plaidoiries. Au paragraphe 7 de sa d\u00e9claration, l'appelante a all\u00e9gu\u00e9:\u2015\n7. Subs\u00e9quemment, \u00e0 une date qu'il est impossible \u00e0 la demanderesse de pr\u00e9ciser, Robert-G. Gagnon a vendu ou s'est d\u00e9parti dudit camion International, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la demanderesse sans payer la balance due sur ledit contrat, ill\u00e9galement et sans droit; la demanderesse en \u00e9tait la seule et unique propri\u00e9taire;\nEn d\u00e9fense, l'intim\u00e9 a sp\u00e9cifiquement plaid\u00e9 les dispositions de l'article 1488 et celles de l'article 1489 et, ce, respectivement aux paragraphe 17 et 18:\u2015\n17. La vente du dit camion par Robert-G. Gagnon \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse est commerciale et en cons\u00e9quence valide m\u00eame si \u00e0 ce moment la demanderesse \u00e9tait encore propri\u00e9taire dudit camion en vertu du contrat ci-dessus produit comme pi\u00e8ce P-1 de la demanderesse, par suite de la balance impay\u00e9e du prix de vente;\n18. Au surplus, comme la d\u00e9fenderesse a achet\u00e9 le dit camion du commer\u00e7ant trafiquant en semblable mati\u00e8re, savoir le dit Robert-G. Gagnon, la demanderesse, qui se pr\u00e9tend propri\u00e9taire dudit camion, ne pouvait le revendiquer sans rembourser au pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse le prix de $1,200 qu'elle a pay\u00e9 de bonne foi au dit Robert-G. Gagnon lors de la vente du 10 octobre 1949 dont le contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit ci-dessus comme pi\u00e8ce D-1 de la d\u00e9fenderesse et auquel celle-ci r\u00e9f\u00e8re pour valoir comme si au long r\u00e9cit\u00e9;\nIl se peut que, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 isol\u00e9ment, le paragraphe 7 de la d\u00e9claration ait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 avec trop de prudence et soit ainsi trop vague pour sugg\u00e9rer qu'en vendant ou se d\u00e9partissant du camion ill\u00e9galement et sans droit, Gagnon le volait n\u00e9cessairement. Mais, appr\u00e9ciant ce paragraphe et les autres de la d\u00e9claration, l'intim\u00e9, \u00e0 tort ou \u00e0 raison, a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'invoquer comme moyen de d\u00e9fense que la saisie-revendication ne pouvait \u00eatre maintenue vu le d\u00e9faut par l'appelante de lui rembourser le montant qu'il, a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 Gagnon; ce qui ne pouvait \u00eatre plaid\u00e9 qu'en envisageant le vol du camion. L'intim\u00e9 a donc lui-m\u00eame soulev\u00e9 clairement la question du vol. Dans Brook v. Booker 3, le Juge en chef Taschereau, examinant une question similaire, disait, \u00e0 la page 196:\u2015\nL'appelant pr\u00e9tend et son argument est, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, sp\u00e9cieux, que la fraude et la collusion n'\u00e9taient pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9es dans l\u00e0 d\u00e9claration du demandeur, en termes assez formels et pr\u00e9cis pour en admettre la preuve. Il est vrai que les mots \"fraude et collusion\" n'y sont pas \u00e9crits, mais les circonstances qui y sont d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es font suffisamment ressortir le dol dont se plaint l'intim\u00e9. \" Nous ne gommes plus au temps des formes sacramentelles en mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dure; il suffit, depuis le nouveau code, d'\u00e9noncer les faits sur lesquels repose une demande judiciaire: les conclusions s'imposent d'elles-m\u00eames.\nLa preuve. Gagnon avait achet\u00e9 ce camion, soi-disant pour faire du transport, au prix de $1,800, dont $659 comptant et la balance, $1,141, plus prime d'assurance $112, et frais de finances $107, soit au total $1,360, \u00e9tait payable par versements mensuels, \u00e9gaux et cons\u00e9cutifs, de $114, le premier devenant d\u00fb le 15 octobre, 1949. Jusqu'\u00e0 parfait paiement, l'appelante demeurait propri\u00e9taire et Gagnon devait \"garder\" et \"maintenir\" ce camion en bon \u00e9tat et \"libre de tous liens ou charges\", et \"permettre au vendeur de l'examiner, sur demande\". Avant m\u00eame que ne vienne d\u00fb le premier versement, Gagnon, le 10 octobre 1949, est all\u00e9 vendre ce camion \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, soit \u00e0 plus de 400 milles de sa place d'affaires, pour $1,200, pay\u00e9 comptant, cons\u00e9quemment \u00e0 un prix inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui pour lequel il l'avait achet\u00e9, et aussi inf\u00e9rieur au solde que lui-m\u00eame devait alors \u00e0 l'appelante. Rappelons, incidemment, qu'il n'avait, \u00e0 ce temps, aucune licence de commer\u00e7ant, celle-ci lui ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e parce qu'il n'avait pas soumis son bilan; et ajoutons que, quelques mois apr\u00e8s cette vente, il faisait faillite. I1 a encaiss\u00e9 et gard\u00e9 pour lui les $1,200 re\u00e7us de l'intim\u00e9; il n'a fait que deux versements, ne payant celui du 15 octobre que le 21 novembre et celui du 15 novembre que le 30 d\u00e9cembre. Cette vente, il l'a cach\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelante. Lorsque le repr\u00e9sentant d'icelle lui demanda, tel qu'elle en avait le droit suivant le contrat, de voir le camion, il a, en deux circonstances, fait de fausses d\u00e9clarations repr\u00e9sentant, en la premi\u00e8re, que le camion \"\u00e9tait en dehors du village pour faire le transport du bois\" et, en la seconde, qu'il \"\u00e9tait en panne dans un petit village ou une colonie en arri\u00e8re de Cap-Chat.\" Plusieurs autres tentatives furent vainement faites par le repr\u00e9sentant de l'appelante pour voir le camion. De guerre lasse, on d\u00e9cida de faire enqu\u00eate pouf, \u00e9ventuellement, d\u00e9couvrir qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. En face de la preuve, le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu:\u2015\nIt can be doubted if the sale on 10th October can be considered as having been effected in good faith; it was certainly in bad faith on the part of the seller Gagnon, \u2026\nCe qui, je crois, \u00e9quivaut, en l'esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 dire que Gagnon s'est appropri\u00e9 le camion, l'a converti \u00e0 son usage, frauduleusement et sans apparence de droit, dans l'intention d'en priver, temporairement ou absolument, l'appelante qui avait, sur le camion, un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et un int\u00e9r\u00eat sp\u00e9cial. Tels sont les \u00e9l\u00e9ments du vol, suivant l'article 347 du Code Criminel, lequel ajoute au paragraphe 4:\u2015\nIl est indiff\u00e9rent que la chose ainsi convertie soit, lors de sa conversion, en la possession l\u00e9gitime de la personne qui la convertit.\nIl se peut qu'accus\u00e9 devant les tribunaux criminels d'avoir vol\u00e9 ce camion, Gagnon ait une d\u00e9fense ou des explications \u00e0 offrir et qu'un jury ne soit pas, par la preuve ci-dessus, convaincu hors de tout doute de sa culpabilit\u00e9. Mais, dans ' une cause civile o\u00f9 la preuve d'un crime est mat\u00e9rielle au succ\u00e8s de l'action, la r\u00e8gle de preuve applicable n'est pas celle pr\u00e9valant dans une cause criminelle o\u00f9 les sanctions de la loi p\u00e9nale sont recherch\u00e9es, mais celle r\u00e9gissant la d\u00e9termination de l'action au civil. Cette question a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e par cette Cour, particuli\u00e8rement dans les causes suivantes:\u2015 Clark v. His Majesty the King 4; London Life Ins. Co. v. Trustee of the Property of Lang Shirt Co. Ltd. 5; The New York Life Insurance Company v. Henry Peter Schlitt 6.\nDans Clark v. The King (supra), le Juge Duff, subs\u00e9quemment Juge en chef de cette Cour, r\u00e9f\u00e8re, \u00e0 la page 616, \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Comit\u00e9 judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans Doe d. Devine v. Wilson 7 dont il cite l'extrait suivant mettant dans toute sa lumi\u00e8re le v\u00e9ritable principe:\u2015\nThe jury must weight the conflicting evidence, consider all the probabilities of the case, not excluding the ordinary presumption of innocence, and must determine the question according to the balance of those probabilities.\nCette d\u00e9cision du Comit\u00e9 judiciaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 encore r\u00e9cemment cit\u00e9e avec approbation de cette Cour dans Smith v. Smith and Smedman 8.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, je maintiendrais l'appel; r\u00e9tablirais les dispositifs du jugement de premi\u00e8re instance; le tout avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les Cours.\nRand J.:\u2015In this case a motor truck, the title to which became vested in the appellant corporation by assignment of a conditional sale agreement, was sold as a used car to the respondent. The seller, a garage operator, although in fact engaged in the purchase and sale of motor vehicles, was not a licensed dealer within the meaning of The Motor Vehicle Act of Quebec; the respondent had no personal knowledge of the business carried on by him some 400 miles from the City of Quebec where the sale took place; and the narrow question is whether that sale is effective as against the corporation.\nThe sale of motor vehicles is dealt with in detail by The Motor Vehicle Act. S. 21 provides that:\u2015\nNo person may deal in motor vehicles without having obtained from the Bureau a license to that effect, upon payment to the Bureau of the following fees:\nThe issue of the license is subject to the furnishing of security:\u2015\nNo such license may be issued before the person applying therefor shall have furnished the Bureau with security for the purpose of guaranteeing to the owner of a stolen motor vehicle, sold by such person, the reimbursement of the price which such owner has paid to any buyer of such motor vehicle, in order to recover the possession by way of revendication as stolen property. In such a case, the owner shall be entitled to claim in his own name, from the dealer and from his surety, the price which he has paid to the buyer.\nPublication of the license is required:\u2015\nThe dealer who is the holder of a license, under the authority of this subdivision, must keep such license posted up in a conspicuous place in his establishment, and must mention the number of such license and the date when it will expire, in every document establishing the sale of a motor vehicle which he effects while his license remains in force. and the last paragraph of s. 21 declares that:\u2015\nNo sale of a motor vehicle effected by a person who is not licensed under the authority of this subdivision, shall be deemed to have been made by a dealer in motor vehicles.\nThese are to be interpreted in the background of arts. 1487, 1488 and 1489 of the Civil Code which read:\u2015\n1487. The sale of a thing which does not belong to the seller is null, subject to the exceptions declared in the three next following articles. The buyer may recover damages of the seller, if he were ignorant that the thing did not belong to the latter.\n1488. The sale is valid if it be a commercial matter, or if the seller afterwards become owner of the thing.\n1489. If a thing lost or stolen be bought in a good faith in a fair or market, or at a public sale, or from a trader dealing in similar articles, the owner cannot reclaim it, without reimbursing to the purchaser the price he has paid for it.\nand art. 14:\u2015\nProhibitive laws import nullity, although such nullity be not therein expressed.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench 9, St. Jacques and Marchand, JJ. dissenting, in reversing the judgment of Gibsone J. at trial, held that the provisions of s. 21 modified the articles quoted only in the case of a vehicle stolen, and since the truck had not been stolen, the purchaser in good faith in a \"commercial matter\" had become the owner of the property.\nI am unable to agree with that view of the effect of the statute. The subject of purchase, sale and other dealings, in motor vehicles 'has been accorded a special code and the reasons behind that action, taken in the interest of public order, are not far to seek. The legislature was bringing under control a business of huge dimensions involving property of high value but exposed in a special manner to all sorts of fraudulent trafficking. To meet that state of things, and having in mind the provisions of the Code, it placed each individual business under a special license, required security to be furnished, and declared that the sale by an unlicensed person should not be deemed to have been made by a dealer in such articles.\nCan, then, a sale made in the face of the statute be treated as a \"commercial matter\" within art. 1488? The contention advanced by the respondent gives to those words a broader scope than embraced within dealings in goods of like kind, a distinction other than that between sales and transactions analogous to them. Commerce consists essentially of the business of buying and selling goods and in relation to a dealer it is necessarily of goods of a class or classes, of \"semblables mati\u00e8res.\" This is clearly indicated by Mignault, Vol. 7 at p. 56, where he says:\u2015\nMais toute vente commerciale de la chose d'autrui n'est pas valide mais seulement celles qui portent sur des objets individuels que le commer\u00e7ant a l'habitude de vendre. Ainsi la vente d'un fonds de commerce faite par un non-propri\u00e9taire serait nulle. Il faut, cependant, assimiler aux ventes commerciales qui peuvent se faire validement de la chose d'autrui, celles qui se font dans une foire, dans un march\u00e9, ou \u00e0 une vente publique (art. 1489). Le code ne dit pas ce qu'il faut entendre par vente publique. Je crois qu'il ne s'agit' pas de la vente faite sous l'autorit\u00e9 de la loi, dont il est question \u00e0 l'article 1490, mais de la vente volontaire aux ench\u00e8res que mentionnent les articles 1564 et suivants.\nPratte J., in his reasons in this case, speaks always of \"un trafiquant en semblables mati\u00e8res.\" It is confirmed by c. 18, statutes of Quebec, 1879, which dealt with the contract of nantissement:\u2015\nAttendu que des doutes se sont \u00e9lev\u00e9s sur le droit que poss\u00e8de un cr\u00e9ancier qui a re\u00e7u un gage en cette province, d'\u00eatre maintenu dans la possession du gage, \u00e0 l'encontre du propri\u00e9taire, lorsque le gage a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u de bonne foi, d'un commer\u00e7ant trafiquant en semblables mati\u00e8res et qu'il est important 'de faire dispara\u00eetre ces doutes. En cons\u00e9quence, Sa Majest\u00e9, etc., d\u00e9cr\u00e8te ce qui suit: 1. Les articles 1488, 1489 et 2268 du Code civil, s'appliquent au contrat de nantissement.\nBut I will assume there is such a distinction. To apply it to the sale here, we must first find the commercial business or course of dealings and the sale must either lie within it or be incidental to it. The seller, Gagnon, was licensed to operate a garage, but the definition of that occupation in the statute as well as its inherent character excludes it from a commercial category. That was recognized by Gagnon: he was introduced to the respondent as a dealer in motor vehicles and in that capacity negotiated the sale. It is only, then, in relation to the business of selling motor vehicles that the case can be brought within art. 1488 as a commercial matter.\nBut s.s. (1) of s. 21, in prohibiting a person from dealing in such vehicles without a license and in declaring that a sale made by an unlicensed person is not to be deemed to have been made by a dealer in them necessarily denies to any such sale a commercial character if the purpose of these provisions is not to be utterly defeated. That the license has regard to sales other than those within art. 1489, apart from the generality of the language of the section, is shown by the fact that although Gagnon had, in 1949, with his application for a license, furnished the security required by s. 21, the license was refused because he had failed to submit his balance sheet. Since the license must be exhibited on the dealer's premises and the number shown on each document of sale, means designed expressly for the protection of the public, the absence of the license is thus effectual to prevent commercial dealings and whatever sales he may be able to make, being in the face of the statute, can only be deemed to be civil. The section does not prevent a sale, but it prevents a commercial sale. There were not, within the contemplation of the statute, commercial dealings of which the sale could be a principal item, and as a consequence there was nothing commercial to which the sale could be an incidental item.\nThe section was considered by this Court in Home Fire & Marine Insurance Company v. Baptist 10, in which, at p. 385, the present Chief Justice, speaking of s. 21, used the following language:\u2015\nDans les cas sp\u00e9ciaux que cette l\u00e9gislation pr\u00e9voit, on a voulu pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e9viter l'application des articles du code.\nI agree, then, with the view taken by Gibsone J., the trial judge and the dissenting judges in the Court of Queen's Bench. The appeal must be allowed and the trial judgment restored with costs in this Court and in the Court of Queen's Bench.\nEstey, J.:\u2015The appellant contends that under s. 21 of the Motor Vehicles Act of the Province of Quebec (R.S.Q. 1941, Ch. 142, s. 21) it has a right to revendicate an International truck from the respondent who purchased it from one Gagnon.\nThe facts are not in dispute. The International truck here in question was sold on October 10, 1949, at the City of Quebec by Gagnon, a garage proprietor at Cap Chat, to the respondent. At all times material to that sale Gagnon did not have a license to deal in motor vehicles as required by s. 21 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Gagnon had purchased the truck on September 15, 1949, under a contract of conditional sale, whereby the ownership remained with the vendor P. E. Bouffard Lt\u00e9e. On the same date (September 15) Bouffard Lt\u00e9e assigned all its vendor's interests under that contract to the appellant. The appellant, as owner, seeks to revendicate this truck from the purchaser-respondent.\nThe learned trial judge of the Superior Court held that the respondent's contract of purchase from Gagnon was, by virtue of s. 21, invalid and allowed the appellant's action.\nThe relevant part of s. 21 of the Motor Vehicles Act reads:\u2015\n21. 1. No person may deal in motor vehicles without having obtained from the Bureau a license to that effect, upon payment to the Bureau of the following fees:\n.......................................................................................................................................\nNo such license may be issued before the person applying therefor shall have furnished the Bureau with security for the purpose of guaranteeing to the owner of a stolen motor vehicle, sold by such person, the reimbursement of the price which such owner has paid to any buyer of such motor vehicle, in order to recover the possession by way of revendication as stolen property. In such a case, the owner shall be entitled to claim in his own name, from the dealer and from his surety, the price which he has paid to the buyer.\n.......................................................................................................................................\nNo sale of a motor vehicle effected by a person who is not licensed under the authority of this subdivision, shall be deemed to have been made' by a dealer in motor vehicles.\nThe majority of the learned judges in the Court of Queen's Bench 11 construed s. 21 as applying only to stolen motor vehicles and, as the record did not establish the truck was stolen, they reversed the learned trial judge and dismissed the appellant's action under the relevant articles (1487 et seq.) of the Civil Code. The minority of the learned judges were of the opinion that s. 21 was not to be construed in that restricted sense and would have affirmed the judgment at trial.\nThis Court held in Home Fire & Marine Insurance Company v. Baptist 12, that the rights of the owner, vendor and purchaser of a stolen motor vehicle must be determined under the foregoing s. 21 rather than Art. 1489 C.C. At p. 385 my Lord the Chief Justice (then Rinfret J.) stated:\nLe but \u00e9vident est d'emp\u00eacher l'application de l'article 1489 du code, et, en pareil cas, d'\u00e9liminer l'obligation du propri\u00e9taire, en revendiquant la machine qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 vol\u00e9e, de 'rembourser \u00e0 l'achteur le prix qu'il en a pay\u00e9.' Donc celui qui ach\u00e8te une automobile d'une personne qui n'est pas licenci\u00e9e perd la protection de l'article 1489 du code civil. D'autre part, si l'acheteur de l'automobile l'a acquise d'une personne licenci\u00e9e, 'dans ce cas', dit l'article 21, 'le propri\u00e9taire (du v\u00e9hicule automobile vol\u00e9) a le droit de r\u00e9clamer en son nom, du commer\u00e7ant et de sa caution, le prix qu'il a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 l'acheteur.'\nIt is contended, on behalf of the appellant, that s. 21 should be construed to apply only to stolen motor vehicles.\nSection 21 is placed in the statute with ss. 15 and 19 in Division III entitled \"Licenses and Permits\" and some asistance in determining the intent of the legislature may be derived from its position and the similarity of the language used in ss. 15 and 19 of the same division. They respectively commence \"No person shall drive a motor vehicle \u2026\" and \"No person shall keep a garage,\" and s. 21 \"No person may deal in motor vehicles \u2026,\" without in each case obtaining the appropriate license. In these three sections the legislature enunciates an all-inclusive requirement of general application and then makes such exceptions and additions as it deems appropriate.\nThe word \"may,\" as used in the English version of the first sentence, s. 21, should be read as \"shall.\" The French version justifies this construction and it is also clear that the section, read as a whole, makes the license an imperative prerequisite to dealing in motor vehicles.\nThen, and of even greater significance, is the fact that the prohibition contained in the first sentence of s. 21 is not qualified by any express provision. If the legislature had intended that a sentence so phrased should be limited or restricted in its application to motor vehicles that have been stolen, it would undoubtedly have used language indicative of that intention and not left so positive and comprehensive a provision to be so construed. Indeed, apart from an express provision or language that necessarily implies such a limitation, it would seem that such a construction would be to add words to the section and, therefore, not to construe but to legislate.\nIt will be observed that it is the dealing in motor vehicles that is prohibited. Gagnon was dealing in motor vehicles in a manner that his sale to the respondent here in question, in the absence of any such provision as s. 21, would appear to come within the phrase \"a commercial matter (d'une affaire commerciale)\" and would be valid within the provisions of Art. 1488. The positive and comprehensive language in the first sentence of s. 21 discloses a clear intention that a sale made by a dealer not licensed shall not be valid and ought not to be construed as \"a commercial matter (d'une affaire commerciale)\" within the meaning of Art. 1488. This conclusion, it would seem, is made very clear by the definition of the word \"dealer\" in s. 2(13), where it is defined as \"any person who deals in motor vehicles.\" Gagnon was in the business of selling motor vehicles, but he was not a dealer in motor vehicles within the meaning of the Motor Vehicles Act because he was not licensed as required thereby and, therefore, the sale was invalid.\nIt is contended, however, that the support for the view that s. 21 should be construed as applicable to stolen motor vehicles only is found in the requirement in sub-s. (1) that as a condition precedent to obtaining a license the applicant must furnish the Bureau with security \"for the purpose of guaranteeing to the owner of a stolen motor vehicle, sold by such person, the reimbursement of the price which such owner has paid to any buyer of such motor vehicle, in order to recover the possession by way of revendication as stolen property.\" This provision, with the greatest possible respect to the learned judges who hold a contrary opinion, is an addition dealing specifically with stolen motor vehicles and not a restriction or limitation upon the prohibition in the first sentence.\nThat the legislature did not intend s. 21 should be limited is apparent from the express provision in sub-s. (2). There it is provided that a dealer or any other person who \"may offer for sale or sell a motor vehicle in a fair or market, or at auction or at a public sale other than that effected according to law,\" is required to furnish security not only to guarantee the owner of a stolen motor vehicle, as under sub-s. (1), but also to give security guaranteeing to the 'buyer of a motor vehicle at such a sale that he, the permit holder, is the owner thereof. Under this provision issues as to title may arise quite independent of any question as to whether the motor vehicle was stolen or not. This provision, together with what has already been said, distin- guishes this from those cases discussed in Hirsch v. Protestant Board of School Commissioners 13, where general words are used and followed by language dealing with specific situations in a manner that shows an intent on the part of the legislature that the general words were not to be given their ordinary, literal effect.\nThe legislature, by the, language used in this section, discloses an intention to deal with sales of motor vehicles generally, with the exception of those isolated and private transactions between citizens. The phrase \"a dealer in motor vehicles (un commer\u00e7ant trafiquant en v\u00e9hicules automobiles)\" in the last sentence of s. 21 appears sufficiently wide to cover both the phrase \"a trader in dealing in similar article (d'un commer\u00e7ant trafiquant en semblables mati\u00e8res)\" in Art, 1489 C.C. and \"a commercial matter (d'une affaire commerciale)\" in Art. 1488. Even if, however, that be not the correct view, when, as already stated, the general provisions of the opening sentence of s. 21 are given their ordinary and grammatical meaning, the legislature cannot have intended that a sale of a motor vehicle by an unlicensed dealer should be construed as \"a commercial matter (d'une affaire commerciale)\" and, therefore, valid within the meaning of Art. 1488. This s. 21 makes a clear distinction between motor vehicles sold by a licensed dealer and those sold by one who is not licensed.\nThe legislature appears, by the enactment of s. 21, to have intended to effect a modification of both Arts. 1488 and 1489 of the Civil Code in respect to motor vehicles.\nThe judgment at trial should be restored and this appeal allowed with costs to the appellant throughout.\nCartwright J.:\u2015The facts out of which this appeal arises are fully stated in the reasons of other members of the Court.\nIt appears from their reasons for judgment that all the learned judges in the Courts below would have maintained the appellant's action if they had reached the conclusion that the automobile purchased by the respondent from Gagnon had been stolen, and I understand that the same view is held by all the members of this Court.\n[page 52]\nAfter considering the whole record I agree with the conclusion of my brother Fauteux \u201ethat the question, whether at the moment of its sale to the respondent the automobile was stolen from the appellant, is sufficiently raised in the pleadings and should be answered in the affirmative. This is sufficient to dispose of the appeal and renders it unecessary for me to deal with the other questions which were argued before us.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Miquelon & Perron.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec 1 affirming (Barclay and Hyde JJ. dissenting) the conviction of the appellant before Girouard J. and a jury on a charge of assault with intent to do bodily harm.\nRemi Taschereau for the appellant.\nAntoine Lacourci\u00e8re, Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\u2015\nTaschereau J.:\u2015I agree with my brother Cartwright that the learned trial Judge failed to properly instruct the jury on the great danger of accepting the evidence of an admittedly perjured accomplice on a vital issue, and that as a result of that omission, the conviction cannot stand.\nHowever, I would not direct a judgment of acquittal. I am not satisfied that a verdict of guilty rendered on the evidence in the record, by a jury properly instructed and acting judicially, would be open to review as unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence. There is I think some evidence that must be left for the sole consideration of the jury, and I would therefore order a new trial.\nThe judgment of Rand and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nCartwright J. :\u2015This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) pronounced on the 13th of February, 1953, affirming by a majority the conviction of the appellant, before Girouard J. and a jury, on a charge that he, on the night of the 21st to the 22nd of July, 1951, with intent to maim or disable Raoul Fortin or to do some other grievous bodily harm to him, did unlawfully wound and cause grievous bodily harm to the said Raoul Fortin by striking him on the head with a blunt instrument and causing a fracture of his skull.\nBarclay and Hyde, JJ. dissenting, would have quashed the conviction and directed a new trial. The appeal is based, pursuant to section 1023(1) of the Criminal Code, on their dissent on the point of law stated in the following words in the formal judgment:\u2015\nthe trial judge failed to instruct the jury on the great danger of accepting the evidence of an admittedly perjured accomplice on a vital issue \u2026 Two questions arise for our consideration, first whether the verdict can stand, and secondly, if it must be set aside, whether we should order a new trial or direct that a judgment of acquittal be entered.\nThe learned trial judge warned the jury in terms to which no exception is taken of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence, of an accomplice but he failed to give them any direction in regard to the fact that Giroux had on two previous occasions made statements on oath which were in direct conflict with the evidence which he had given at the trial on a vital point.\nI respectfully agree with Barclay and Hyde JJ. that, in the circumstances of this case, the omission to direct the jury in this regard was an error in law so serious as to require that the conviction be quashed. I do not find it necessary to refer to all the authorities which were discussed by counsel. I am in respectful agreement with Hyde J. that the applicable rule is correctly stated by Errol McDougall J. who gave the judgment of the majority in Rex v. Stack and Pytell 2 in the following words:\u2015\nWhere the testimony of a principal Crown witness is in direct conflict with a prior sworn statement made by him the trial Judge must caution the jury in the strongest terms with respect to the danger of accepting his evidence, and the failure to do so will necessitate a new trial, notwithstanding that the trial Judge properly instructed the jury with respect to the evidence of such witness in the event that they concluded that he was an accomplice.\nWith the greatest respect for the contrary view entertained by the majority in the Court of Queen's Bench I do not think that the circumstance that counsel for the defence stressed the fact of the conflicting statements having been made in any way absolved the learned trial judge from the duty of dealing with them.\nIt remains to consider whether or not a new trial should be directed. After an anxious perusal of the whole record I had prepared somewhat lengthy reasons dealing with this question, referring to the evidence in considerable detail and reaching the conclusion that we ought to direct an acquittal. However, as the majority of the Court are of opinion that a new trial should be ordered and it is not usual to discuss the details of the evidence when that course is to be followed, I propose simply to state the result at which I arrived. I am of opinion that on the evidence in this record a properly instructed jury should have acquitted the appellant and that therefore we should not direct a new trial.\nI would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered.\nAppeal allowed; new trial ordered.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taschereau & Cliche.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Antoine Lacourci\u00e8re.\n1 Q.R. [1953] Q.B. 234.\n2 [1947] 3 D.L.R. 747 at 762; 88 Can. C.C. 310 at 327.\n"}
