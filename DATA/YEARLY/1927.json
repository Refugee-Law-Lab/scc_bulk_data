Morton (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nMichael Wilkinson Brighouse (Defendant) Respondent.\n1926: May 4; 1927: January 4.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Idington, Duff, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nTrust\u2014Trustee\u2014Accounting\u2014Moneys received by nephew of deceased\u2014Evidence of intention to make gift to nephew\u2014Applicability of Strong v. Bird (L.R. 18 Eq. 315).\nOne S. B. was owner of a large tract of land and other assets and, being a bachelor and having no relatives in this country, brought out in 1888 from England his nephew, the respondent. The latter lived with his uncle, assisted him in his business and eventually was allowed a very large measure of control over his affairs. In 1906, S. B. made his will leaving the bulk of his estate to the respondent; and in 1907 he executed a power of attorney, under which the respondent was formally given powers to act for him in the management of his affairs. In 1908, S. B. went to a hospital, and shortly thereafter left for England where he died in 1913. While there, in 1912, S. B. changed his will in favour of some of his English relatives, but still left a substantial part of his estate to the respondent. In an action by the executor of the will of 1912 to compel the respondent as trustee for the estate of his uncle to account for rentals, profits and moneys received by him during the lifetime of his uncle, for, as alleged, the benefit of the latter, the defence was set up that the deceased evidenced his intention to permit the respondent to retain said moneys free from any condition that he should be regarded as a trustee with respect thereto. The language of the deceased, as reported by the respondent in his evidence, imports a declaration of a then present intention by the deceased to give all his real and personal property to the respondent; and that the respondent was to do as he pleased with it and was to be under no obligation to account for it. The trial judge held the respondent was not accountable on the ground that there had been a gift to him of these moneys, that the intention to give had remained unaltered down to the time of his death and that his judgment must be governed by the decision in Strong v. Bird (L.R. 18 Eq. 315). The judgment of the trial judge was affirmed, the Court of Appeal being equally divided.\nHeld, that the principle laid down in Strong v. Bird was not applicable to the circumstances of this case and that the respondent was accountable for all moneys of the deceased received by him since 1907, excepting those in respect of which the intended gift above mentioned was completed within the lifetime of the deceased.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (36 B.C. Rep. 231) reversed. APPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming on equal division of the court the judgment of the trial judge and dismissing the appellant's action. The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nC. W. Craig K.C. for the appellant.\nE. P. Davis K.C. and E. F. Newcombe for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe and Rinfret J.J.) was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014This is one of those cases in which there is, perhaps, some risk of sympathy with a claimant's disappointment in his legitimate expectations leading one into a departure from the sound application of legal principles. The respondent's claim against the estate of Sam Brighouse is substantially stated in the sixth paragraph of the statement of defence, in these words:\u2014\nIn the alternative and in further answer to the whole of the said statement of claim this defendant says that he was told by the said Sam Brighouse at or about the date of the said alleged power of attorney that he this defendant was to consider all the real and personal property of the said Sam Brighouse as his own and that he was to do as he pleased with it and that he was to be under no obligation whatever to account for any moneys collected under the said alleged power of attorney.\nand this claim ultimately rests upon this passage in his own evidence given at the trial:\u2014\nThe witness: I had been doing his business right along, and he told me to take everything, and use it in any way I pleased, his property, I could sell it if I wanted to for cash, or use it for my own use, and for himself, and even if I wanted to go into business, I could sell his property in order to do that. He said he had given instructions to Chaldecott\u2014I had been up to the office the day previous, and he had read his will to me, this was 1906, and said everything was coming to me, and he said he had given authority to Chaldecott to make out a power of attorney, and the reason he did that was so if I did sell this property, I would have power to put it in the Registry Office, and against other people. It was not as a power of attorney for me to use it, because I had been practically doing that right along.\nMr. Davis: Q. Now had you any conversation with him at this time which you speak of after leaving Chaldecott's office, at the time you say he read the will and so on?\u2014A. Yes, that same conversation which I have just mentioned now. Q. That was the time?\u2014A. That was the time. Of course that has happened often, but this was more particular, because he said he was giving up everything, he wanted little for himself, just a little to eat, wear and drink, and little of that, and the balance I could do as I liked with. He was giving up all, and leaving the whole thing to me.\nWe need not concern ourselves with any other part of the evidence. Brighouse made a will in 1906, by which, after leaving annuities of comparatively trifling amount, he bequeathed his residuary estate to the respondent. In 1907, he executed a power of attorney, under which the respondent was formally given most ample powers to act for him in the management of his affairs. The respondent himself says under this power of attorney he managed the property of Brighouse, executed leases of the real property, received the rents and made investments. In all this, he says, he acted as the representative of Brighouse. In passing, there is a remark which, I think, ought not to be omitted. In reading the evidence of the respondent, I have been impressed by his obviously straightforward desire to state the facts as he remembers them.\nIn 1908, Brighouse had a serious operation, after which, according to the evidence of the respondent, his mental powers suffered a decline, and, as a result of which, he eventually became demented. In 1911, Brighouse executed a codicil to the will of 1906, making unimportant alterations in the particular legacies, but leaving the respondent still the beneficiary of his residuary estate. In 1912, Brighouse left Vancouver for England, and in the same year he executed a new will, the effect of which will be fully stated. In 1913 he died. The question with which this action is immediately concerned is whether the respondent is liable to account, at the suit of the executors and trustees of the will of 1912, for moneys collected by him on behalf of Sam Brighouse from the year 1907 on. The learned trial judge held he was not accountable, on the ground that there had been a gift to him of these moneys, and that the intention to give had remained unaltered down to the time of his death, and that his judgment, therefore, must be governed by the decision in Strong v. Bird[2]. In the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Martin accepted the conclusion of the learned trial judge, and Mr. Justice M. A. Macdonald agreed with him in a judgment based in principle upon the authority which the learned trial judge applied, while the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Galliher thought that the respondent had failed to establish his claim, and that the judgment of the trial judge should be reversed.\nIt will be convenient first to consider whether the principle of Strong v. Bird[3] can be applied in this case. In substance, Sir George Jessel, in Strong v. Bird[4], held that a testator, having manifested an intention in his lifetime to forgive an existing debt, an intention which continued unchanged down to his death, and having appointed the debtor his executor, the debt having by this latter act become extinguished at law, equity would regard the gift as complete. In a later case, the rule was applied to the gift of a specific chattel, it having been proved that the intention to give continued down to the testator's death. Is the principle of these decisions applicable to the circumstances of this case? The claim, as stated in the pleadings, is that the respondent was, by the declaration of Brighouse, to consider the real and personal property of Sam Brighouse as his own, and that he was to do as he pleased with it, and was to be under no obligation to account for it. As the respondent, in his testimony, says, he was to take everything, and more particularly \"he,\" Sam Brighouse,\nwas giving up everything, he wanted little for himself, just a little to eat, wear and drink, and little of that, and the balance I could do as I liked with. He was giving up all, and leaving the whole thing to me.\nThe language of Brighouse thus reported by the respondent imports plainly a declaration of a present intention to give all his real and personal property to the respondent, and that is the basis upon which the claim is rested in the pleadings. The foundation of the claim is a present gift of his real and personal property.\nAs regards personal property, immediately reduced into possession by the respondent, the gift was no doubt effective. But, in attempting to apply the principle of Strong v. Bird[5], we encounter difficulties of a most serious nature. First, is there evidence of an intention to give continuing down to the death of Brighouse? This seems difficult to maintain, in view of the will of 1912. That will was dated the 13th of November, 1912. By it, Michael Wilkinson, the respondent, is the beneficiary under a specific devise of the farm at Vancouver. That specific piece of property is segregated from the estate, and given to the respondent. All the rest of the property, real and personal, the testator gives to his trustees, to be divided among others. There can be no possible doubt as to the meaning of the testator's language. When he speaks of the \"remainder of my real estate,\" he refers to the real estate still standing in his name, of which he was still in law and in equity the owner, notwithstanding the incomplete gift of 1907. So, with regard to his personal estate. This disposition of his property it is at least difficult to reconcile with the notion that he at that time considered he had divested himself by a gift inter vivos of all his property in favour of the respondent; with the intention, that is to say, that the gift of 1907, deposed to by the respondent in the passages above set out, should stand and have effect.\nBut there are other difficulties. As already mentioned, the gift relied upon is a present gift of everything. It could not legally take effect, except in the limited way I have mentioned. It is at least very questionable whether the language actually imports any intention to give after acquired property, the produce of the property presently given, because that would be logically inconsistent with the assumption that everything was passing in presenti Assuming, however, an intention to give after acquired property to be implied, a gift of after acquired property would, of course, be inoperative. After acquired property can be transferred where the transfer is for valuable consideration\u2014to which equity will give effect as a contract; but a gift of after acquired property cannot have such effect. In principle, Strong v. Bird[6] would appear to have no application in such a case, and that appears to be in substance the view taken by that great master of law, Mr. Justice Parker, In re Innes[7]. A gift of after acquired property could have no meaning except as a promise to give on a future occasion, and that, Parker J. says, would be outside the principle of Strong v. Bird[8]. The whole passage is valuable as an exposition of that principle, and I cite it in full:\u2014\nThat part of my decision turns really upon a question of fact, but another point which is raised is one partly of fact and partly of law. It has been held in the case of Strong v. Bird[9] that where a testator has attempted to forgive a debt by telling his debtor that the debt is forgiven, though that cannot at law operate as a release, yet there is a present intention of giving, which, if the debt is subsequently released, may be effectual, and that the appointment of the debtor subsequently as an executor is a sufficient release at law to give validity to the gift which was otherwise imperfect. That is a decision of Sir George Jessel in 1874, and it has been acted upon, I think, ever since, and recently has been somewhat extended by a decision of Neville J. in In re Stewart[10]. The way in which the principle enunciated by Sir George Jessel has been extended is that it had been made, according to Neville J's. decision, applicable not only to the release of a debt, but in order to perfect an imperfect gift of specific property. In the case of In re Stewart[11], the testator had given his wife certain bonds and other securities, as to which there was no doubt, and these securities had been enumerated in a document at the foot of which the testator had written, in pencil, \"Coming in next year \u00a31,000,\" and on the evidence Neville J. construed those words as an announcement of the intention to give a further \u00a31,000 to his wife the next year. It appears that one of the bonds which had been handed over was paid off, and \u00a3500 came, in respect of it, into the hands of the testator. In reinvesting that next year he added rather over \u00a31,000 to it and bought three further bonds. He took the contract note for those three further bond to his wife, and he handed it to her in an envelope with the broker's letter announcing the purchase, and he said, \"I have bought these for you.\" Neville J. held that that was a present intention to give which would have operated as a gift but for the fact that certain things remained to be done which were not done, so that the gift was imperfect. But the testator subsequently died, having appointed his wife his executrix, and Neville J. held that the principle of Strong v. Bird[12] was applicable, and that, there having been an actual attempted gift, imperfect though it might have been, the subsequent appointment of the lady as executrix perfected that gift by vesting in her the legal interest in the property which was the subject of the action.\nIt is attempted here to extend the doctrine of those cases still further. In the first place it is attempted to extend it to what, if there was a gift at all, was a gift of money without that money being identified, or sufficiently identified to enable it to be separated from the rest of the estate of the testator; and in the second place it is attempted to extend the principle of the earlier cases not only to an actual attempted gift which as a matter of fact is imperfect, and therefore will not take effect unless it is subsequently perfected; but to a mere promise to give on a future occasion.\nIn my opinion the principle of Strong v. Bird[13] and In re Stewart[14] and other similar cases ought not to be so extended. What is wanted in order to make that principle applicable is certain definite property which a donor has attempted to give to a donee, but has not succeeded. There must be in every case a present intention of giving, the gift being imperfect for some reason at law, and then a subsequent perfection of that gift by the appointment of the donee to be executor of the donor, so that he takes the legal estate by virtue of the executorship conferred upon him. It seems to me that it would be exceedingly dangerous to try to give effect by the appointment of an executor to what is at most an announcement of what a man intends to do in the future, and is not intended by him as a gift in the present which though falling on technical considerations may be subsequently perfected.\nI was at one time inclined to think that up to a certain point the respondent's case might be supported in this way, namely, that the conduct of Brighouse down to the time of his departure for England, if not down to the time of the will of 1912, could be taken as establishing a gift inter vivos from time to time of all property reduced into possession by the respondent during that period as and when that may have occurred; but a close examination of the record, I regret to say, convinces me that this view cannot be sustained. In the first place, the claim is not based on any such ground in the pleadings, and a claim of this kind, made against a deceased person's estate, ought to be put forward clearly. In the second place, the notion of a continuous gift by conduct of the proceeds of property, is not easily reconcilable with the fundamental basis of the claim. If Brighouse had really intended, as the respondent and other witnesses as well represent him as saying that he intended, to divest himself at a stroke of all his property, one does not easily think of him applying his mind to the subject from day to day thereafter and intending de die in diem a gift of the produce of the property. It is hardly necessary to say that the reduction into possession by the respondent of Brighouse's funds pursuant to a previous gift (which could only operate as regards such funds as an unenforceable promise to give) would confer upon the respondent no title to such funds. Lastly and most important of all there really is no evidence directed to substantiating any such basis of claim; and when one considers the views as to the state of Brighouse's health held by the respondent himself, whose candour and honesty are beyond praise, one understands the difficulty the respondent's advisers must have felt in advancing such a claim. In truth counsel for the respondent at the trial put his case squarely upon Strong v. Bird[15], and upon that principle alone, and the appellants were never called upon to meet any other case.\nThe appeal must therefore be allowed. There should be a declaration that the respondent is accountable for all moneys of the late Sam Brighouse received by him since the 26th day of February, 1907, excepting moneys in respect of which the intended gift mentioned in the pleadings was completed within the lifetime of the said Sam Brighouse. The respondent will, of course, be entitled to all just and proper allowances for expenditures made by him, and for all costs, charges and expenses incurred by him in or in relation to or in connection with the affairs of the said Sam Brighouse. Further directions will be reserved to the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The course of the litigation has been signalized by much difference of judicial opinion, and, having regard to that as well as to the exceptional circumstances, we think this is a case for an exceptional order as to costs. The costs of all parties as between solicitor and client, as well as all other charges and expenses of or incidental to the action or the appeal to the Court of Appeal or to this court, properly incurred, will be paid out of the estate.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an action brought by appellant, under the direction of the court, suing, in his capacity as administrator and one of the trustees of the estate of the late Sam Brighouse the respondent Michael Wilkinson Brighouse, for an account of moneys and properties belonging to the said Sam Brighouse and received by said respondent under and by virtue of a power of attorney dated the 6th of February, 1907 under the following circumstances:\nSaid Sam Brighouse had been born and brought up in England, and migrated to Canada and settled in Lulu Island in British Columbia, where I infer he became a very prosperous farmer and later on acquired valuable properties in Vancouver, all of which on account of his health needed someone to assume the management thereof.\nOn a trip to England in 1888 he had brought back with him one of his nephews\u2014the said respondent, then a lad of twenty-four years of age\u2014who continued to live with him on said farm, and helped him in many ways.\nThe said Sam Brighouse was a bachelor and had no relatives of his own in this country. Hence, as was quite natural, he became accustomed to rely upon and trust said nephew (now respondent) as if his own son, which resulted in the making of a will on the 7th November, 1906, whereby, in the second paragraph thereof, he appointed said respondent and others as follows:\u2014\nI appoint Michael Brighouse Wilkinson, Charles Edward Hope and Joseph Richard Seymour, all of the city of Vancouver (hereinafter called my trustees) to be executors and trustees of this my will.\nThen he devised and bequeathed as follows:\u2014\nI give all my plate, linen, china, glass, books, pictures, prints, furniture and household effects and all my farming stock, horses, cattle, sheep, pigs and other animal, and all my wagons, carriages, harness, farming machinery, implement and other farming accessories and things to the said Michael Brighouse Wilkinson absolutely. I give to my executors Charles Edward Hope and Joseph Richard Seymour the sum of two hundred dollars each provided they prove my will and act in the trusts hereof. I give Francis Miller Chaldecott the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars. I give Alfred Pearson (half brother of said Michael Brighouse Wilkinson) the house and one acre of land more or less now occupied by him, being part of my farm at Lulu Island, for life, so long as he shall occupy same, and if he shall cease to occupy and reside there, then said house and land shall revert and form part of my farm as dealt with below. I give my farm at Lulu Lsland, being situate between roads numbered two and three containing about seven hundred acres more or less and consisting of sections 5, 6, 7, and 8, block 4, north range 6 west, and section 32, block 5, north, range 6 west being all my farm lands situate as aforesaid and bounded on the south by the right-of-way of the Vancouver and Lulu Island Railway, on the west by no. 2 road, and on the north by the Fraser river and on the east by no. 3 road, in trust for the said Michael Brighouse Wilkinson (subject to all mortgages and existing charges at the time of my decease, and to the above life tenancy of one acre aforesaid to Alfred Pearson) for life, so that he shall not have power to dispose of the same in the way of anticipation but with power nevertheless for the said Michael Brighouse Wilkinson to appoint by deed or will in favour of his issue and in default of appointment and so far as such appointment shall not extend in trust for all the children of the said Michael Brighouse Wilkinson who being sons, shall attain the age of twenty-one years or being daughters shall attain the age of twenty-one years or marry, in equal shares and if there shall be only one such child the whole to be in trust for that one child, but so that no child who or any of whose issue shall take any share under such appointment as aforesaid shall participate in the unappointed part of the said moiety without bringing the share or shares appointed to him or her to his or her issue into hotchpot and accounting for same accordingly unless the said Michael Brighouse Wilkinson shall by such appointment direct to the contrary. Provided always that the above bequest of a life interest in the said farm with power of appointment to the said Michael Brighouse Wilkinson is conditional upon his adopting the surname of Brighouse in lieu of Wilkinson within the period of two years from my death, and in default of his so doing, I devise and bequeath my said farm to the eldest living son (at the time of such default) of my late brother Radcliffe Brighouse.\nI may mention the fact that he gave annuities of $260 each to a brother and two sisters and a friend, and another of $130 to a friend and the residue after paying for all those and the liabilities, to the respondent.\nI copy this to make quite clear the actual facts so much in conflict with the statements of others concerned, including the respondent, and his co-called corroborating witnesses.\nThe said farm made ultimately nearly the half of the whole estate, or, according to the version of the respondent, a third or thereabout.\nIt will be observed, that so far from the testator having given him everything he had given him absolutely only a small fraction, I imagine, of his personal estate and a life estate in the farm and otherwise as a trustee the power of appointment in favour of his children and all that, only conditionally upon his adopting within two years after the testator's death, the surname of Brighouse instead of Wilkinson.\nAnd that clearly involved the need of respondent surviving the testator before he could acquire anything; and yet the courts below have held that an interpretation and construction must be put upon the conversation, which respondent testifies to, and which I am about to quote, that would give him the absolute right to all the moneys and properties of the testator of which he got possessed meantime.\nThe conversation I refer to and upon which said courts rest is as follows:\u2014\nDirect examination by Mr. Davis:\nQ. You live where, Mr. Brighouse?\u2014A. At the present time in Vancouver.\nQ. How long have you been in the province?\u2014A. Since 1888.\nQ. What relation was the late Sam Brighouse to you?\u2014A. He was my uncle.\nQ. Who brought you out here?\u2014A. My uncle.\nQ. And how old were you at that time?\u2014A. About 24.\nQ. From that time on, with whom did you live, or with whom did he live?\u2014A. With him. Q. Was he a married man?\u2014A. No. My mother kept house for him most of the time.\nQ. Your mother was his sister?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. So that he had no family. Had he any other relations here outside of yourself and your mother?\u2014A. A brother and a half brother who came later.\nQ. In order to get at some of these dates, what was the date when he went to the hospital?\u2014A. Between Christmas and New Year, 1908.\nQ. And February, 1907, was the date of the power of attorney from Sam Brighouse to you?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Why was that power of attorney given, for what purpose and how to be used?\nMr. Smith: Surely the power of attorney speaks for itself.\nThe court: Why it was given would not appear from the document.\nMr. Smith: The powers that are given in it would show why it was given.\nMr. Davis: I am not referring to the powers given in it.\nMr. Smith: I think that is all my friend is entitled to show.\nThe witness: He gave me a reason himself, Mr. Smith.\nMr. Davis: What reason did he give you?\nMr. Smith: I object.\nThe witness: I had been doing his business right along, and he told me to take everything and use it in any way I pleased, his property, I could sell it if I wanted to for cash, or use it for my own use and for himself, and even if I wanted to go into business, I could sell his property in order to do that. He said he had given instructions to Chaldecott\u2014I had been up to the office the day previous, and he had read his will to me, this was 1906, and said everything was coming to me, and he said he had given authority to Chaldecott to make out a power of attorney, and the reason he did that was so if I did sell this property, I would have power to put it in the Registry Office, and against other people. It was not as a power of attorney for me to use it because I had been practically doing that right along.\nMr. Davis: Q. Now had you any conversation with him at this time which you speak of, after leaving Chaldecott's office, at the time you say he read the will and so on?\u2014A. Yes, that same conversation which I have just mentioned now.\nQ. That was the time?\u2014A. That was the time. Of course, that has happened often, but this was more particular, because he said he was giving up everything, he wanted little for himself, just a little to eat, wear, and drink, and little of that, and the balance I could do as I liked with. He was giving up all, and leaving the whole thing to me.\nQ. Was any one else present at that time?\u2014A. No, only he repeated the same thing in my office when Mr. McPherson was there and I think Mr. Currie. Mr. McPherson is dead.\nQ. And you think Mr. Currie. Is that the Mr. Currie who gave evidence here?\u2014A. Yes.\nThis cheery interpretation of that conversation is sadly in conflict with the actual facts then existent and, if possible, more so with the words of the power of attorney then in contemplation and, I have no doubt at all, in due course of being written according to the literal instructions of the testator and that he did not in fact change his mind and convey to the respondent any other or different meaning.\nThat power of attorney accords with common sense and is not limited to mere purposes to be served in cases of registration as respondent and his counsel would have us believe.\nThe first part of it reads as follows:\u2014\nKnow all men by these presents, that I, Sam Brighouse of Lulu Island, British Columbia, for divers good causes and considerations, me there unto moving have nominated, constituted and appointed, and by these presents do nominate, constitute and appoint Michael Brighouse Wilkinson, of Vancouver City, British Columbia, my true and lawful attorney for me and in my name and on my behalf and for my sole and exclusive use and benefit to demand, recover and receive from all and every or any person or persons whomsoever all and every sum or sums of money, goods, chattels, effects and things whatsoever which now is or are, or which shall or may hereafter appear to be due, owing, payable or belonging to me whether for rent or arrears of rent or otherwise in respect of my real estate or for the principal money and interest now or hereafter to become payable to me upon or in respect of any mortgage or other security, or for the interest or dividends to accrue or become payable to me for or in respect of any shares, stock or interest which I may now or hereafter hold in any joint stock or incorporated company or companies or for any moneys or securities for money which are now or hereafter may be due or owing or belonging to me upon any bond, note, bill or bills of exchange, balance of account current, consignment, contract, decree, judgment, order or execution, or upon any other account. Also to examine, state, settle, liquidate and adjust all or any account or accounts depending between me and any person or persons whomsoever. And to sign, draw, make or endorse my name to any cheque or cheques, or orders for the payment of money, bill or bills of exchange, or note or notes of hand, in which I may be interested or concerned, which shall be requisite. And also in my name to draw upon any bank or banks, individual or individuals, for any sum or sums of money that is or are or may be to my credit or which I am or may be entitled to receive, and the same to deposit in any bank or other place, and again at pleasure to draw for from time to time as I could do. And upon the recovery or receipt of all and every or any sum or sums of money, goods, chattels, effects or things due, owing, payable or belonging to me for me and in my name and as my act and deed to sign, execute and deliver such good and sufficient receipts, releases and acquittances, certificates, reconveyances, surrenders, assignments, memorials, or other good and effectual discharges as may be requisite.\nThis I copy so far not only to shew that the basic element of its entire character was that respondent was to act for and on behalf of the testator, as it expresses\nfor me in my name and on my behalf and for my sole and exclusive use and benefit to demand, etc.,\nbut also in a great variety of cases not confined, as pretended, to the needs of registration. And the remainder of the said power of attorney continues to specify a great variety of commercial dealings not necessarily needing any registration to become effective.\nIn fact the necessity for using the power of attorney in case of registration never arose until the testator had left this country in 1911 for England.\nIn the meantime the testator had himself personally, and not by his said attorney, executed two instruments, being all I can find trace of herein, needing registration, whilst he was in this country.\nIndeed the respondent says he never used the power of attorney for registration purposes until the Burns lease which would be on or after 1st August, 1912.\nThe following evidence was given by the respondent on cross\u2014examination:\u2014\nQ. I think you told me on the examination for discovery, that the power of attorney was made to you after the conversation in regard to everything being yours?\u2014A. He instructed Chaldecott to make out the power of attorney\u2014I don't think I saw the power of attorney until I needed it to sign the deed to Burns.\nQ. Just to make it clear. I will read your examination. Question 965, \"Well, was there ever any one else present with you at any time he spoke to you about it?\u2014A. I don't think so.\nQ. The conversation that you referred to, when all those people were present, MacPherson, Currie, Sam Brighouse and yourself, in your office, was prior to the time you got the power of attorney?\u2014A. I don't think I had received the power of attorney then, because I don't think I took the power of attorney out of the office until I needed it to make the Burns lease.\"\u2014A. That is correct.\nQ. It hadn't been delivered to you at that time?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Now, there was no one present at that conversation except the two of you?\u2014A. Except when it was reiterated, as I say in my own office.\nIn this there are incidentally two illustrations of what sort of memory the respondent has, for, in fact the first use made of the power of attorney for registration was not the Burns lease, but a lease of 1st January, 1912, to one Hinton and others\u2014seven months before the Burns lease.\nAnd again Currie, whom he names as present at one of the interviews on which he rests his case, does not seem to have been there. At least Currie does not mention it, as certainly he would have been glad to do if he could have recalled it, for he also goes, it seems to me, very far, as I will presently shew, to help his friend.\nThe respondent would seem from his story, if believed, never to have bothered his head about the power of attor- ney, although, as he admits, his uncle the testator had expressly told him that Chaldecott, the solicitor, was preparing it. The absurd nature of the story that he never saw it until five or six years later should, I submit, go far to discredit him.\nAre we to credit the memory of such a man when testifying in September, 1925, more than eighteen years later, as against such a written document expressing clearly what the testator intended, and believe that the latter, a very successful business man, expressed himself so very differently to the respondent.\nThen it is pretended that such an inherently incredible story was corroborated by Currie and others.\nLet us consider the story of Currie presented first. He tells of walking with the testator in November, 1908, when he told him as follows:\u2014\nMr. Brighouse was with me. We were all together, but we were behind the others; and Mr. Brighouse made the statement to me\u2014we were talking about things in general\u2014and Mr. Brighouse made the statement to me that everything he had was Michael's to use, and do with as he liked, and he had made a will to that effect.\nQ. What was the date of that?\u2014A. November, 1908.\nQ. No, you mention another occasion, when was that, and where, and what were the circumstances?\u2014A. Another occasion that I remember distinctly was after Mr. Brighouse had returned to his home from the hospital after being there for several months, in his own house at Lulu Island, he made a statement to the same effect.\nQ. Who were present at that time?\u2014A. Just himself and me.\nQ. Where was he at the time?\u2014A. He was in bed at the time.\nQ. What did he say at that time?\u2014A. He said at that time that everything he had was Michael's to use and do with as he liked; that he had kept his estates together, and it was his.\nUp to that time no will which we know of, had been made by the testator, except that of November, 1906, which I have dealt with above and submit that its contents absolutely destroy this story.\nThat however is accepted by the learned trial judge and, I most respectfully submit, that his doing so is a grave error. He refers (apparently as a reason for so finding) to the fact that these and other witnesses were not seriously cross-examined as to their credibility. The most successful way, I have often found, of dealing with preposterous statements, as I submit some of these are in light of the facts, is to leave those uttering them alone or lead such wit- nesses on. In doing so herein I submit counsel was well advised.\nJorgenson is the next witness the learned trial judge names, and he testifies as follows:\u2014\nQ. You cannot tell what other persons told, but just Sam Brighouse himself.\u2014A. Yes, Brighouse himself told me not once, but told me several times, that Michael Wilkinson had everything and done what he wanted with the money and property, and if it had not been for Michael, he would have lost it anyway.\nQ. How often have you had that sort of conversation with him, or heard those statements from him?\u2014A. I can't recall how many times, but quite frequently.\nCan this evidence in light of the actual facts be at all corroborative of anything likely to be the truth when we know the actual facts as above recited?\nI fail to see how that sort of stuff can form such corroboration of anything which the law requires in such a case as this.\nCocking came next in the list the learned trial judge specifies. The gist of his evidence is as follows:\u2014\nQ. What was the substance of what he said to you with respect to Michael, as to how things were carried on between them?\u2014A. The time which is most clear to my mind now is the time I took him to the hospital. He was going to the hospital to be operated on, and, knowing him as I did, I said: \"Mr. Brighouse, how have you got things fixed? Have you made a will?\" and he told me he had. He told me Mr. Chaldecott, I think it was, made his will. He said, \"Anyway, everything I have got is Michael's,\" and that Michael could use anything he had got as though it was his own. Also, that anything that was transacted, anything that Michael said was all right.\nAgain the only will made up to that time was the will above dealt with.\nHow can anyone read the cases deciding what is meant by \"corroboration\" recognized by the statute in question herein and hold there is anything useful in such stories as witness tells.\nThe contribution of Saurberg, also called to corroborate but not named by the learned trial judge, is, if possible, illustrated best by the following:\u2014\nA.I went to work for him in June, 1908. I was interested in fancy chickens, and I worked up some prize laying hens, and I made up my mind I was going into the business, and buy a few acres on Lulu Island, and raise chickens, so I went to Mr. Brighouse and wanted to buy three acres, and he said, \"You had better go and see Michael about it, everything I have belongs to him. He has made everything for me, and kept the estate together. If it had not been for him I would have had hardly anything left. Burdis, another who witnessed a codicil of the testator on 13th January, 1911, speaks as follows:\u2014\nQ. Did you ever have any conversation with Sam Brighouse with reference to the relations between him and his nephew Michael, the defendant?\u2014A. Scores of them.\nQ. To what effect?\u2014A. The general situation existing between Mr. Wilkinson Brighouse and himself.\nQ. What was the substance of those conversations?\u2014A. Oh, at various interviews over long periods, it is very difficult to define any particular occasion, but it shewed the close association which existed between his nephew and himself.\nQ. Well, what was that, as shown by his conversation?\u2014A. He trusted Michael Wilkinson absolutely. He said on many occasions the property would not have been held intact if it had not been for the influence and care of his nephew, Michael Wilkinson.\nQ. Anything else?\u2014A. He always called the property \"ours.\" It was very seldom he talked about his property. He always talked about our property, and he refused to deal with business matters, but referred everything to his nephew. He said Michael had authority to do anything he liked, whatever Michael did was right, because he knew when he died\u2014Michael knew and he knew, when he died, everything would go to Michael Wilkinson.\nI agree with the reasons assigned by the Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal below, and with Mr. Justice Galliher, but have thought better to quote as I have done rather than act on the condensed abbreviation of the evidence adduced, and relied on.\nI fail to find anything in all the said evidence or anything else in this case, which I have read and considered carefully, that can bring it within the authority of the case of Strong v. Bird[16], or any of the other cases relied upon.\nThe characteristic of each of such cases in maintaining gifts of one sort or another is that in each of them there happens to be an important circumstance, inherent in each of said cases, maintaining the like claim whereas in the case presented by the respondents herein the circumstances are overwhelmingly against the respondent, in my humble judgment.\nTherefore in my opinion this appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and judgment directed giving the relief the appellant prayed for in the action in question.\nI may be permitted to add that the last will of the testator, made in England, is in all its essential features such a reasonable disposition and distribution of his pro- perty as any reasonable person should expect, in the circumstances in which the testator was placed, and remedies what the first will, I imagine, discloses a seeming want of generosity on the part of the testator, possessed of so large an estate, when dealing with the amounts left to his brother and sisters, unless of course they were each and all wealthy people.\nOn such assumption the last will, I submit, clearly should not be invaded and nullified by such evidence as respondent gives and produces to help him when he is getting such handsome treatment as it gives him.\nOf course I think he is in his accounting to be entitled to any reasonable commission and expenses for work done under the power of attorney as if a stranger doing it thereunder and liable for interest on that he is found accountable for from the date of the testator's death.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

Act, ss. 109, 102, 126, 92\u2014The Ultimate Heir Act, Alta., 1921, c. 11. Lands in the province of Alberta, granted by the Crown since 1st September, 1905, when The Alberta Act came into force, which have escheated for want of heirs or next of kin, escheat to the Crown in the right of the Dominion. Trusts and Guarantee Co. v. The King (54 Can. S.C.R. 107) followed.\nLands in Alberta granted by the Crown prior to 1st September, 1905, which have escheated subsequent to that date, also escheat to the Crown in the right of the Dominion. By s. 21 of The Alberta Act \"All Crown lands, mines and minerals and royalties incident thereto\" are retained by the Dominion. The phrase \"Crown lands, mines and minerals\" does not necessarily import lands, etc., held by the Crown in sole proprietorship; it should be read as including all interests of the Crown in lands, etc.; reading it thus, \"lands, mines and minerals\" may be regarded as the antecedent of the phrase \"incident thereto\"; accordingly the Dominion retains all interests of the Crown in lands within the province, together with all royalties incident to such lands; any royalty affecting lands, such as the right to escheat, might properly be described as a royalty \"incident to\" lands. The above construction is supported, when the section is compared with s. 109 of The B.N.A. Act, and read in light of the judgments in Atty. Gen. of Ontario v. Mercer (8 App. Cas. 767) and Atty. Gen. of British Columbia v. Atty. Gen. of Canada (14 App. Cas. 295 at pp. 304, 305).\nPersonal property situated in Alberta of persons domiciled in Alberta and dying intestate since 1st September, 1905, without next of kin, go to the Crown as bona vacantia in the right of the province. The effect of s. 3 of The Alberta Act was to give the newly created province \"power of appropriation\" (s. 102 of The B.N.A. Act; and see s. 126, and Liquidators of the Maritime Bank of Canada v. Receiver General of New Brunswick ([1892] A.C. 437 at p. 144) over revenues belonging to the same classes as those over which the original provinces had such power before Confederation, and which, under The B.N.A. Act, they still possess; subject, of course, to the enactments of The Alberta Act.\nThe Ultimate Heir Act, Alta., 1921, c. 11, in so far as it purports to affect real property, is ultra vires; it is legislation disposing of assets designated as belonging to the Dominion by the statute which brought the province into existence and defines its powers and rights, rather than truly an exercise of the provincial legislative authority in relation to the law of inheritance.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta (22 Alta. L.R. 186) reversed in part.\nAPPEAL by the Attorney General of Canada from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] in so far as it upheld the contentions of the province of Alberta on certain questions in dispute, under a special case submitted to that court. The case came before it as a consolidation of three separate applications by the administrators, made by way of originating notices, for advice and directions in respect of questions arising in the administration of certain estates of deceased persons, which applications, as to the claims advanced by the respective intervenants, were referred to the Appellate Division.\nThe estates in question were those of John Wudwud, deceased, Zadai Malesco, deceased, and David Stevenson, deceased. In each case the deceased died in Alberta, domiciled in Alberta, intestate, and without heirs or next of kin (other than as provided in The Ultimate Heir Act hereinafter referred to, in the case of Malesco who was the only one who died after that Act came into force) and leaving both real and personal property.\nWudwud died on June 24, 1918. The patent to the realty was granted (to the deceased's predecessor in title) by the Department of the Interior at Ottawa on August 15, 1910.\nMalesko died on April 24, 1921. The patent to the realty was granted by the Department of the Interior at Ottawa on December 28, 1920. Stevenson died on November 8, 1919. The real estate was patented prior to the creation of the province of Alberta. The patent to the deceased's predecessor in title was issued in 1884, and the transfer to deceased was dated and registered in 1904.\nThe questions dealt with by the Appellate Division and its holdings thereon were as follows:\n(1) Do lands situated in Alberta granted by the Crown since September 1, 1905, when The Alberta Act, 4 and 5 Edw. VII, c. 3, came into force, which have escheated for want of heirs or next of kin, escheat to the Crown in the right of the Dominion of Canada or in the right of the province of Alberta?\nThe Appellate Division answered this question in favour of the Dominion of Canada, following Trusts and Guarantee Co. v. The King[2].\n(2) Do escheated lands in the province of Alberta granted by the Crown prior to September 1, 1905, which have not become Crown lands by escheat or otherwise prior to that date, escheat to the Crown in the right of the Dominion of Canada or of the province of Alberta?\nThe Appellate Division answered this question in favour of the province.\n(3) Does personal property situated in Alberta of persons domiciled in Alberta and dying intestate since September 1, 1905, without next of kin, go to the Crown as bona vacantia in the right of the Dominion of Canada or of the province of Alberta?\nThe Appellate Division answered this question in favour of the province.\n(4) Is c. 11, 1921 (Alberta) entitled An Act to Provide for an Ultimate Heir of Lands and Next of Kin of Intestate Persons (now R.S.A., 1922, c. 144, The Ultimate Heir Act) intra vires in whole or in part? (By the said Act a person dying intestate and without heirs or next of kin, is deemed to have made a will in favour of the University of Alberta, and the university is made the ultimate heir and next of kin of any such person).\nThe Appellate Division answered this question in favour of the province, holding the statute to be intra vires. N. D. Maclean K.C. and E. Miall for the appellant: Alberta, which never owned lands, mines and minerals, or royalties such as escheats and bona vacantia, is not in the same position as Ontario and British Columbia, which had owned them previous to becoming part of the Dominion. The words \"All lands, mines, minerals, and royalties,\" as used in s. 109 of The B.N.A. Act, are limited and controlled by the words \"belonging to the several provinces\" in the same section. See The King v. Atty. Gen. of British Columbia[3]. If, as submitted, s. 109 is not applicable to the province of Alberta, its case fails, as nowhere in The Alberta Act is there any grant to the province of royalties such as escheat and bona vacantia.\nShould this court hold that said words in s. 109 are not limited as aforesaid, it is submitted that said s. 109 is subject to s. 21 of The Alberta Act. S. 21 is not a reservation from a grant of certain lands, etc., but is a declaration. The words in s. 21 are \"All Crown lands, mines and minerals and royalties incident thereto.\" Clear distinction must be drawn between the meaning of Crown lands and, for instance, unpatented lands or ungranted lands, as used in the Manitoba Act. The true meaning of Crown lands is the estate of the Crown in lands. This includes its allodial estate in lands granted or ungranted.\nCrown prerogatives of the Dominion could not be transferred to the province by implication, particularly in view of s. 16 of The Interpretation Act (R.S.C., 1906, c. 1.). Such could only be done by express words. See Maxwell on Statutes, 5th Ed-., p. 220; Th\u00e9berge v. Landry[4]; Gushing v. Dupuy[5]; Atty. Gen. of British Columbia v. Atty. Gen. of Canada[6]; Atty. Gen. of Canada v. Atty. Gen. of Ontario[7].\nThe Ultimate Heir Act, Alta., 1921, c. 11, is colourable legislation and ultra vires. If escheat and bona vacantia fall to the Dominion, this Act is a direct appropriation of Dominion rights. Admitting the province's right to deal with succession, and property and civil rights, there is a difference between an incidental infringement of Dominion rights, as was the action of Saskatchewan in allowing illegitimates to inherit\u2014Atty. Gen. of Canada v. Stone [8] \u2014and the entire appropriation of Dominion rights as here attempted. The Ultimate Heir Act is entirely new, remedied no existing wrong, and is contrary to what has always been our law. It was enacted from the province's desire to secure the revenues which it tried to get by its Act of 1915 (c. 5), which, so far as that Act purported to deal with escheat of land, was held in Trusts and Guarantee Co. v. The King [9] to be ultra vires. The contention that the University of Alberta is a corporate entity, entirely distinct from the province, while true in letter, is not true in fact, as the bulk of the money required for the university's support is provided by the province (R.S.A., 1922, c, 56, s. 80). Receipt of revenues by the university under The Ultimate Heir Act would relieve the province pro tanto. The \"true nature and character of the Act,\" its \"pith and substance\" shows it to be in reality an attempt to appropriate the Dominion prerogatives of escheat and bona vacantia under the guise of legislation as to inheritance, and therefore ultra vires. Atty. Gen. for Ontario v. Reciprocal Insurers [10] and cases cited therein.\nW. S. Gray and J.J. Frawley for the respondent: The relation between the Crown and the province is the same as that which subsists between the Crown and the Dominion in respect of such of the public property and revenues as are vested in them respectively. Liquidators of the Maritime Bank of Canada v. Receiver General of New Brunswick[11].\nIt is finally settled that escheats and bona vacantia are \"royalties\" within the meaning of s. 109 of The B.N.A. Act, and go to the Crown in the right of the province in so far as the four original provinces are concerned, and in so far as British Columbia, subsequently admitted, is concerned. Atty. Gen. of Ontario v. Mercer[12]; The King v. Atty. Gen. of British Columbia[13]. Ss. 102 and 109 of The B.N.A. Act apply to Alberta, under s. 3 of The Alberta Act (except in so far as varied), and, therefore, on authority of above eases, escheats and bona vacantia go to the province of Alberta, except as The Alberta Act changes that disposition. It may be contended that s. 109 cannot apply to Alberta because it did not own lands, etc., at the Union, as it only came into existence then as a province. But said a 3 makes it clear that s. 109 applies just as if the province had a previous existence. There might be no lands, mines or minerals to which it could apply, but the royalties or jura regalia and the right to them came into existence contemporaneously with the creation of the province, and its right arises immediately just as if it had a previous existence. By & 109 lands, etc., and royalties were declared to belong to the several provinces in which the same \"are situate or arise.\" \"Royalties,\" including in that term the right to escheats and bona vacantia, were rights arising in the future; the right to them arose from time to time after the province was established, and the provision as to them in s. 109 applied. See The King v. Atty. Gen. of British Columbia[14], and the same case in the Supreme Court of Canada[15].\nReading ss. 3 and 21 of The Alberta Act together, it is obvious that ss. 102 and 109 of The B.N.A. Act apply to Alberta, except as modified by said s. 21. S. 21 defines what royalties are reserved to the Dominion, the rest going to the province by virtue of said s. 109. From one point of view this is something in the nature of a grant and a reservation. S. 21 limits the reservation to royalties incident to Crown lands, mines and minerals. As to escheats, the reservation limits them to Crown lands, that is, land which at the time the Act came into force was still in the Crown, so that the right to escheats of land patented before that time is in the province. There is no reservation whatever as to bona vacantia.\nPractically the same language is used in admitting Alberta and Saskatchewan as was used in admitting Manitoba, British Columbia and Prince Edward Island, as to making applicable the provisions of The B.N.A. Act. S. 109 was applied in favour of British Columbia in The King v. Atty. Gen. of British Columbia[16], and it is beyond doubt that the intention in each case of new provinces entering or being established was that they were to be put on exactly the same footing as the original provinces, except in the minor respects enumerated in the different Acts and Orders in Council.\nThe contention that, as the Crown in the right of the Dominion had the title to the land before it was, granted, it must go back to the Crown in the right of the Dominion in the event of escheat arising, overlooks two things: (1) That when Alberta was established, the distribution of property and powers between the Dominion and the provinces was made \"as if * * * Alberta had been one of the provinces originally united,\" and to give full effect to these words, it must be conceded that Alberta commenced its existence (so far as possible) with all the property and powers which the original provinces had \"excepting so far as varied,\" etc. This clearly covers the case of royalties such as escheats and bona vacantia, which are abstract rights arising after the creation of the province. [17]That the Crown is one and indivisible; the Crown in the right of the province is the Crown to the same extent as the Crown in the right of the Dominion, and an escheat to the Crown in the right of the province is an escheat to the Crown, or the lord from whom the land was held.\nIf royalties are not disposed of as above contended, they go to the Crown in the right of the province by reason of the exclusive jurisdiction as to \"property and civil rights.\"\nEven if nothing were said about royalties in The B.N.A. Act or The Alberta Act, the right to bona vacantia would belong to the province. The right does not arise like escheat, but simply because there are goods without an owner or any one who can claim through the deceased, and the Crown steps in and takes. In this connection, see In Re Barnett's Trusts (2), Halsbury's Laws of England, vol. 7, para. 442. As to lands unpatented when the province was formed it was decided in Trusts and Guarantee Co. v. The King [18] that the right of escheat is in the Dominion, (To preserve rights in event of further appeal it is submitted such decision was wrong). As to lands patented before the province was formed, escheats go to the province by virtue of ss. 3 and 21 of The Alberta Act. See last mentioned case at p. 124, and Atty. Gen. of Canada v. Stone (4) at p. 689.\nThe Ultimate Heir Act is intra vires. It provides an heir and prevents escheat arising. It comes within the province's jurisdiction over property and civil rights. See Trusts and Guarantee Co. v. The King[19]; Atty. Gen. for British Columbia v. The King[20]; Atty. Gen. of Canada v. Stone[21]; and same case below[22]; Atty. Gen. for Quebec v. Atty. Gen. for Canada[23]. Escheat has been prevented from arising by legitimation Acts, and by Acts creating heirs for such illegitimate persons, by Acts enabling aliens to hold lands, by Acts abolishing forfeitures consequent on attainder, felony, etc., also by adoption Acts under which rights of inheritance and succession are conferred on legally adopted children. The Ultimate Heir Act is legislation of a similar kind and clearly within provincial powers.\nThe history of the law relating to escheats shows that from the beginning the right to escheat has been whittled away, the whole tendency being in favour of preventing escheats. See Burgess v. Wheate[24].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014The answer to the first question is dictated by the judgment of this court in The Trusts and Guarantee Co. v. The King18, and is to the effect that such lands escheat to the Dominion.\nAs to the second question, it is convenient first to limit ourselves to the case of lands granted by the Crown in right of the Dominion, the absolute title to which was vested in the Dominion at the time of the grant.\nDid the right of escheat in respect of such lands, which, prior to the enactment of The Alberta Act, was a \"royalty\" belonging to the Crown in right of the Dominion, pass to the province by force of that statute? S. 21 of The Albert act is in these words:\nAll Crown lands, mines and minerals and royalties incident thereto, and the interest of the Crown in the waters within the Province under The North-West Irrigation Act, 1898, shall continue to be vested in the Crown and administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada, subject to the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada with respect to road allowances and roads or trails in force immediately before the coming into force of this Act, which shall apply to the said Province with the substitution therein of the said Province for the North-West Territories.\nThe observations of Lord Selborne in Attorney General of Ontario v. Mercer[25], are sufficient warrant for saying that it is at least doubtful whether such royalties can pro-perly be described as interests in land and whether they would fall within the scope of the expression \" Crown lands,\" standing alone.\nAccording to the narrowest construction, \" royalties incident thereto \" may be treated as royalties incidental to the Crown title to lands, mines and minerals withheld by force of the 'section from the province. But there is a more liberal construction which must be considered: the phrase \" Crown lands, mines and minerals \" does not necessarily import \" lands, mines and minerals \" held by the Crown in full proprietorship. It may be read as including all interests of the Crown in lands, mines and minera lit within the province. And reading it thus, \" lands, mines and minerals \" may be regarded as the 'antecedent of the phrase \" incident thereto.\" According to this reading, the Dominion retains all interests of the Grown in lands, mines and minerals within the province, together with all royalties incident to such lands, mines and minerals. Any royalty affecting lands, mines and minerals (such, for example, as the right of escheat, according to which lands held in fee simple by a subject are liable to return to the Crown upon a failure of heirs) might not improperly be described as a royalty \" incident to \" lands, mines and minerals, and this 1927 reading seems the more probable one.\nThe consequences q of the narrow construction might g, indeed, be startling. In view of the judgment of Lord Watson in Attorney General of British Columbia v. Attorney General of Canada[26] (the Precious Metals case), it is at least doubtful whether the \" precious metals \" are comprehended within the 'expression \" lands, mines and minerals \" in s. 21. For the right to them, the Dominion must rely upon 'the reservation of royalties. And this right, as Lord Watson points out, is in no way accessory to any title of the Crown to land, or to mines and minerals in the sense in which, according to the views expressed in the passage referred to above, those words are used in. s. 109 of The. British North America Act and, presumably, in s. 21 of The Alberta Act. The consequence, therefore, of reading the words incident thereto,\" as comprising only royalties incidental or accessory to the the Crown's title in lands, mines and minerals, in the sense in which those words are here used, would be to exclude the precious metals or, rather, the jus regale touching the precious metals, from the reservation.\nThe effect of the section, by this construction, is to reserve the territorial revenues of the Crown to the Dominion, and when- the language of this section is compared with that of s. 109 of The British North America Act, and read in light of the judgments in Attorney General of Ontario v. Mercer[27], and the Precious Metals case[28], there seem to be solid grounds for the view that such was the intent with which it was enacted. There is the highest and most weighty authority for construing this enactment in a broad and liberal spirit. Attorney General of Ontario v. Mercer (2), at pp. 778 and 779. The answer to the second question will therefore be that such lands escheat to-the Dominion.\nAs touching the question of the right to bona vacantia, a different set of considerations must be examined. This right is not one ofthose reserved by 8s. 21, and, as respects it, the answer to this question must turn upon the effect of s. 3, which is in these terms:\nThe provisions of The British North America Acts, 1867 to 1886, shall apply to the province of Alberta in the same way and to the like extent as they apply to the provinces heretofore comprised in the Dominion, as if the said province of Alberta had been one of the provinces originally united, except in so far as varied by this Act and except such provisions as are in terms made, or by reasonable intendment may be held to be, specially applicable to or only to affect one or more and not the whole of the said provinces.\nThe Dominion advances the view that those provisions of The British North America Act, which deal with the allotment of the public property and revenues, have for their subject matter property and revenues which, at the time the Act took effect (or was to take effect), were or might be at the disposition of a colony having a legislature or government independent of the Dominion; and that subsequently they can have no application to (or even a meaning as applied to) provinces newly created under the authority of The British North America Act, 1871, such as Saskatchewan and Alberta.\nThere are, no doubt, many provisions of The British North America Act which, according to the strict letter, are not capable of application to the case of such a province. But; in so far as such provisions are in substance fairly applicable in a manner consonant with the general intendment of The Alberta Act, there seems to be no good reason for refusing to give effect to them accordingly.\nThe pertinent provisions of the Act are found in sections 102, 109 and 126. These provisions deal with property in the narrow sense, and with revenues derived from the exercise of jura regalia, over which the provinces, at the time of the union, possessed \"power of appropriation.\" It is this, power of appropriation which is reserved to the provinces. See s. 126, and Liquidators of the Maritime Bank of Canada v. Receiver General of New Brunswick[29].\nIf we consider the substance of the matter, there appears to be no very cogent reason against ascribing to these provisions, under the authority of s. 3 (in their application to Alberta), the only meaning according to which they are not insensible in relation to a newly created pro- vince, that is to say, as giving to such a province \"power of appropriation\" over revenues belonging to the same classes as those over which the original provinces had such power before Confederation, and which, by force of these provisions, they still possess; subject always, of course, to the enactments of The Alberta Act itself, and in particular to s. 21.\nThere is great force in the argument advanced by the province that sections 20 and 21 are most naturally read as presupposing the existence of some such general disposition in favour of the province; and the observations of Lord Selborne in Attorney General of Ontario v. Mercer [30] already alluded to, as to the spirit in which these enactments should be construed, cannot be insisted upon with too much emphasis.\nThere remains the question touching the validity of the Alberta statute. That the province of Alberta has plenary authority, under s. 92, to lay down the rules governing the devolution of both real and personal property at the death of the owner is, of course, past question. The real subject of controversy is whether or not the impeached statute is legislation in relation to rights of inheritance.\nIt must first be observed, as regards lands, that the second section of the statute, which is the section in question, comes into operation only when the events have happened under which, if the statute had not been passed, lands to which it relates would (assuming rights of escheat affecting lands acquired through The Hudson's Bay Company are not within s. 21) have vested in the province; or, by force of s. 21, would have vested in the Dominion. S. 2 of The Ultimate Heir Act declares that, in respect of such lands, the owner, dying intestate, shall be deemed to have made a valid will, devising them to the University of Alberta, and that the University of Alberta shall be deemed to be the heir and the next of kin of any person \"so dying as aforesaid.\"\nThe direct effect and aim of this statute are, by means of a legal fiction, to dispose of, inter alia, real property which, by The Alberta Act, is reserved to the Dominion. S. 21, which must be read as a qualification of s. 109 of The British North America Act (see Attorney General of British Columbia v. Attorney General of Canada (1)), vests exclusively in the Dominion the power of appropriation over the property and rights to which it relates. The impugned enactment assumes to appropriate such property. Neither is it wholly without significance that the beneficiary of this legislative effort of the Alberta Legislature is to be an institution that, as regards finances, is mainly dependent upon that legislature for its support, and is very largely under the control of the Crown in right of the province.\nThis is legislation disposing of assets designated as belonging to the Dominion by the statute which brought the province into existence and defines its powers and rights; rather than truly an exercise of the provincial legislative authority in relation to the law of inheritance; and, being thus repugnant to the enactments of that statute, it is in law inoperative.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Neil D.

Babbitt (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1926: November 2, 3; 1927: February 1.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nReal property\u2014Title by possession\u2014The Limitations Act, Ont. (R.S.O., 1914, c. 75) s. 5\u2014Nature of use and occupation\u2014Nature and extent of enclosure\u2014Evidence as to length of time\u2014Trial judge\u2019s estimate of witnesses\u2014Reversal of findings.\nIt was held that plaintiff had acquired title by possession to a strip of land covered by the paper title of defendants, adjoining land owners; that the planting and care of a hedge which, for a part of its length, encroached on defendants\u2019 land, the construction and main- tenance of a walk on plaintiff\u2019s side of the hedge and partly on said strip, the cultivating with flowers, lawn and terracing up to the hedge, and the continuous general use and enjoyment, by plaintiff or his predecessor in title, of said strip along with the other land occupied by him, there being no fence or other construction (except the hedge) to indicate a boundary, constituted a use and occupation which, if exclusive and continued for the statutory period, established a right by possession under s. 5 of The Limitations Act, R.S.O., 1914, c. 75 (Marshall v. Taylor [1895] 1 Ch. 641 at p. 646); that the user in question could not be deemed an exercise of a mere right of way; and that, on the evidence, continuous exclusive actual occupation by plaintiff or his predecessor in title, for over ten years, was established.\nPossession may be none the less sufficient to warrant the application of s. 5 of The Limitations Act, even though there is no real enclosure (Seddon v. Smith 36 L.T.R. 168 at p. 169). The hedge in question, though not continued to the rear boundary of the land, had the strongest evidential value as marking the extent or area of occupation and showing adverse possession.\nThe trial judge\u2019s estimate of witnesses loses much of its weight when he gives for such estimate reasons which, upon examination, are found unconvincing and unsatisfactory.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario (57 Ont. L.R. 60), reversing judgment of Widdifield Co. C.J. affirmed, Duff and Newcombe JJ. dissenting.\nPer Duff and Newcombe JJ. (dissenting):\u2014The hedge was not intended to be definitive of any line, or to mark the limit of any occupation; it included nothing and excluded nothing; it had an obvious purpose explaining its existence and use, namely, to buttress a walk along a side hill; in the circumstances it was meaningless as evidence of exclusive possession of the soil; the evidence as to the beginning of construction of the improvements relied on was not clear or definite, and was unsafe to be regarded as initiating a period of prescription for the title; there was nothing pointing to an intention to exclude, within the principle stated in Littledale v. Liverpool College ([1900] 1 Ch. 19 at p. 23). The time of the existence of the hedge was not satisfactorily established, and the trial judge\u2019s findings thereon, his estimate of the witnesses forming a substantial part of his reasons, should not have been set aside (SS. Hontestroom v. SS. Sagaporack et al, 136 L.T. 33 at p. 37 et seq.).\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of His Honour, Judge Widdifield, of the County Court of the county of York, dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action.\nThe action involved the question of title to a strip of land which formed part of lot 40 on the north side of Roxborough St. East, Toronto, as shown on registered plan no. 528. The paper title to lot 40 was in the defendants, but the plaintiff, who owned lot 41, lying immediately to the west of lot 40, claimed title to the strip in question by virtue of The Limitations Act, R.S.O., 1914, c. 75, s. 5.\nThe formal judgment of the Appellate Division declared that the plaintiff was the owner in fee simple, as against the defendants, of the strip in question, and vested the same in the plaintiff, and ordered the defendants to remove so much of a stone wall as they had erected thereon, and enjoined them from interfering with or lessening the plaintiff\u2019s lateral support, and ordered them to restore the same so far as they had disturbed it, and also awarded damages, to be ascertained by a reference.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs, Duff and Newcombe JJ. dissenting.\nW.N. Tilley K.C. and G.T. Walsh for the appellants.\nJ. Jennings K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014The issue involved is the title to a strip of land on lot 40 on the north side of Roxborough street east, in the city of Toronto.\nIn 1909, Arthur Bollard purchased lot 41 adjoining lot 40 on the west. He erected thereon a residence which was completed and into which he and his family moved in October, 1911. Bollard having died, his widow sold and conveyed the property to the respondent. The deed is dated the 30th September, 1919.\nThe appellants acquired lot 40 on the 15th May, 1923.\nThe lands comprised in lot 41 rise very rapidly from the street line to the rear of the lot. In order to gain access to the residence, the owner terraced the lands between the street and the front of the house and erected two flights of steps separated by a little plateau, from which at the top a pathway curved off to the house. This was at first a wooden walk and later a flagstone walk. Alongside it was planted a hedge beginning about 50 feet north of the street line and extending in a curved line to a point about 18 feet south of the northerly boundary of the lots. Such was the layout, in 1923, when the appellants purchased. The hedge was then more than three feet high, about a foot and a half wide, and fairly thick. There was nothing to distinguish from the residential property of the respondent the strip of land lying immediately next to the hedge and which is now in dispute. It was occupied, used and enjoyed as one property. \u201cIt was terraced right out: a flower bed along the verandah and then terraces and the walk laid along the lower terrace beside the hedge.\u201d There was no \u201csign of any boundary or break between the house and the hedge.\u201d The adjoining lot 40 was vacant, rough and uncultivated. Mr. Speight, an Ontario Land Surveyor, described it as being \u201cin a state of nature.\u201d Looking upon the property one would naturally infer that the strip in question and the hedge belonged to lot 41. The dividing line between this and lot 40 does not run at right angles to Roxborough street. The ground was very uneven and contained no indication of the true boundary. These additional features helped to induce the belief undoubtedly entertained by respondent Babbitt and apparently by his predecessor, that the \u201chedge was well within the line.\u201d\nThe first act of the appellants, after their purchase of lot 40, was to have a survey made. Then only was it discovered that the respondent\u2019s occupation encroached beyond the true line. To this the attention of the respondent was drawn and he was given the opportunity of purchasing the land, but he insisted that he owned it by right of possession. The appellants then informed him by letter, dated 28th November, 1923, that \u201cunless the encroaching hedge (was) removed,\u201d they intended \u201cto cut it down.\u201d This threat was later carried out and the appellants excavated port of the lands claimed by the respondent, destroyed about 60 feet of the hedge and tore up the flagstone walk throughout the whole distance from where it crossed the line.\nThereupon the respondent brought this action claiming a declaration that he was \u201cthe owner of the lands and premises within and to the west of the hedge,\u201d an injunction restraining the appellants from entering upon and excavating these lands, a mandatory order directing them to restore them to their previous condition, and damages. Whether these remedies should have been granted\u2014as they were by the Appellate Division\u2014must be determined from the character and length of the occupation by the respondent and his predecessor in title. It is not disputed that the possession was continuous and without any interruption between Bollard, the first owner, and Babbitt, the present respondent.\nNow if the character of the occupation be first examined, it will be found that a general use was shown of the disputed strip of land by the owners of lot 41. The following is the description given by the witnesses:\nThomas B. Speight\nQ. Then inside the flag stones and between it and the true boundary line what was there?\u2014A. Between the flags, there was\u2014it was sodded.\nQ. Trimmed and cared for?\u2014A. Oh, yes.\nQ. Was that evident that had been part of the land pertinent to house?\u2014A. Every indication it had been, yes.\nMr. WHITE: NOW, now.\nThe WITNESS: Indication it had been used, I suppose.\nMr. JENNINGS: Q. Did anything divide that sod to the east of the true boundary line and between it and the flag stones walk from the rest of the land belonging to house 256?\u2014A. How do you mean?\nQ. Was there anything at all to separate the land within and to the west of the true boundary line from the land to the east of the true boundary line up to the flags?\u2014A. No, nothing.\nQ. All one lawn?\u2014A. Yes.\nThe COURT: Q. That is, the lawn between the verandah and the flag stones was continued?\u2014A. Yes, oh yes.\n* * *\nIt was good hedge, there is no doubt about that.\nQ. Did it very clearly limit the lawn?\u2014A. Yes.\nMrs. Mary Bollard\nQ. Well then, between your verandah and the flag stone walk what did you have?\u2014A. Flowers, wide bed of flowers.\nQ. And then?\u2014A. Sidewalk and then the hedge.\nQ. Now, flowers and the sidewalk; did the flower bed come right up to the sidewalk\nor\u2014A. Well, alongside the verandah.\nQ. And then between the flower bed and the walk was there\u2014A. This was long since.\nQ. Well then, what about the space between the verandah and the walk, what did you do with it?\u2014A. What did we do with it?\nQ. Yes?\u2014A. I do not quite understand.\nQ. Did you leave it alone or did you trim it?\u2014A. Hedge was always trimmed.\nQ. And the ground between the walk and the verandah and the hedge?\u2014A. We attended to our own, we did not go outside the hedge.\nQ. But between the verandah and the hedge, did you have it attended to?\u2014A. Yes. Q. Clipped and cut and cultivated with flowers?\u2014A. Yes.\n* * *\nQ. If you think this is wrong, stop me\u2014do not answer this for a moment. Am I right in saying that the land within the hedge was used and cultivated and enjoyed by you with the rest of your property?\u2014A. Inside of the hedge?\nQ. Yes?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nMrs. McPherson, daughter of first owner:\nQ. What was the means of access to 256 in the fall of 1911?\u2014A. Steps going up the front, then little plateau, and then up again.\nQ. And from the top of these steps?\u2014A. Then the sidewalk.\nQ. Wooden walk?\u2014A. Yes, wooden walk.\nQ. Where was it?\u2014A. It was next to the\u2014well, there was terrace between that and the verandah and then flower bed afterwards and then of course verandah.\nQ. Where was that wooden walk with regard to the location of the flag stone walk that was there last year?\u2014A. Last year?\nQ. I mean the flag stone walk that was subsequently put down?\u2014A. Well, it was next to the hedge.\nQ. But was there any difference between the location of the flag stone walk and the original wooden walk?\u2014A. No, not that I know of.\n* * *\nQ. Then between the walk, first wooden and then flag stone, and the verandah in the rear of the house, what was there?\u2014A. There was grass there.\nQ. There was no boundary, no indication between the walk and the verandah, from the house?\u2014A. Just where do you mean?\nQ. Here is your walk as shown on exhibit two?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And here is verandah, and the back part of your house?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Was there any obstacle or obstruction or boundary between?\u2014A. No, not at all.\nThe COURT: Supposing we get at it shorter.\nQ. Was there ever at any time anything indicating the boundary between 40 and 41?\u2014A. Just the hedge.\nQ. Here, this red line shows what is really on the survey, true line between the two lots; was there ever anything in the way of fence or anything to show that true line there?\u2014A. Just hedge.\nQ. Nothing but the hedge?\u2014A. No.\nMr. JENNINGS: Q. Nothing in the shape of a fence?\u2014A. No, nothing at all.\nRichard C. Babbitt\nQ. Then what was the nature of the land within and to the west of this hedge?\u2014A. It was terraced right out, flower bed along the verandah and then terraces and the walk laid along the lower terrace beside the hedge.\nQ. Any sign of any boundary or break between the house and the hedge?\u2014A. None whatever.\n* * *\nQ. Was there any cultivation of the land west of the hedge?\u2014A. There is lawn kept cut and flower beds.\nQ. And?\u2014A. Terraces kept trimmed. The above acts must be considered in addition to the construction and maintenance of the flagstone walk and the planting of the hedge. Such a user cannot be treated as the exercise of a mere right of way. It constitutes an assertion of ownership. Laying flagstones across another\u2019s land may sometimes be regarded as done for the mere purpose of a passageway; but, in this instance, when we consider the continuity of the lawn and the general use made of the strip within the hedge, when we come to see that there was in fact nothing to distinguish the enjoyment of that strip of land from that of the balance of the residential property, we are constrained to the conclusion that any occupation the respondent and his predecessor in title had of part of lot 40 was not \u201cfor the sole purpose of going to and coming from the dwelling house on lot 41,\u201d which was the view held by the learned trial judge.\nIn a very similar case (Marshall v. Taylor[2]), Lord Halsbury, after referring to the setting out of rose beds and the laying down of a cinder walk and of cobble stones, and treating the disputed lands as part of the adjoining garden, stated:\nIt seems to me about as strong an aggregate of acts of ownership as you can well imagine for the purpose of excluding possession of anybody else.\nIn holding a contrary view, the learned trial judge appeared to have been rather impressed by the fact that, at the rear of the property, the hedge did not curve back so that an opening was left between it and the dividing line of the lots; and he referred to Griffith v. Brown[3], where, he said,\nthe judgment in appeal proceeds largely on the ground that the plaintiffs did not have exclusive possession of the way, that there, as here, there was no gate or bar to prevent the defendant or any one else, from travelling over it. In short, it was not an exclusive possession.\nPossession may be none the less sufficient to warrant the application of The Limitations Act (R.S.O., 1914, c. 75, s. 5) even although there is no real enclosure (Seddon v. Smith[4]). The hedge, in this case, though not continued to the boundary at the rear, has the strongest evidential value as marking the extent or area of occupation and showing adverse possession. In fact, there was not on behalf of the appellants the slightest attempt to prove that they, at any time, had made use of the strip in question, even by crawling through the hedge (Littledale v. Liverpool Coolege[5]). The respondent and his predecessor actually had a peaceful, exclusive and unquestioned enjoyment. Although the hedge was a \u201cvery marked feature of the property,\u201d wide, thick \u201cvery clearly limiting the lawn\u201d and there was no other indication of a boundary, Mrs. Bollard says she never heard of any difficulty about it.\nThis is not therefore, as was thought by the learned trial judge, a \u201cclaim. . . to any way or other easement\u201d falling under section 35 of the Act, but a case for the application of section 5 and the ten years\u2019 limitation. Whether the respondent is otherwise within the section in respect of the continuity of his possession and the statutory period of occupation remains to be examined.\nWe must first ascertain the date when the hedge was planted by Bollard, for the evidence shows that, from that time on, the lay-out of the strip remained pretty much the same throughout, or, at least, was not so different as to change the mode of occupation and the nature of the use made by the owner. Mrs. Bollard, when shown the sketch (exhibit two) made by the surveyor Speight, on the 17th December, 1923, said it represented the property \u201cexactly as it was since 1912.\u201d The condition remained the same as she described it during the time she and her husband occupied it \u201cfrom 1912 to 1919.\u201d Mrs. McPherson said there was no \u201ctime, to (her) knowledge, when that hedge was not there in this same position.\u201d Mr. Speight did not show it on his plan made in 1917, but this is satisfactorily explained by the fact that he was not then concerned with Bollard\u2019s property. He had received his instructions on behalf of Mr. McPherson for the survey of the property east of Bollard\u2019s. He did not likewise show the flights of steps, which everybody agrees were built before Bollard moved into his house in 1911.\nThe critical question, however, is whether the respondent has established ten years\u2019 pedal possession. The answer is found in the evidence of Mrs. Bollard and her daughter, Mrs. McPherson. Mrs. Bollard is an elderly woman and her memory proved to be defective in some minor particulars. However, the trial judge thought that she \u201cwas giving her evidence to the best of her recollection,\u201d and some discrepancies upon unimportant matters are not sufficient to discredit her entire testimony. Asked about the date when the terracing was done and the hedge was started, she answered: \u201cIt was either one or the other, I could not say for sure, it was either 1912 or 1913.\u201d\nThe year when this work was done is undoubtedly very material in this case. Evidence of that character is clearly indecisive, and would, if it did not go beyond that, leave the question undetermined. But, while Mrs. Bollard hesitates between 1912 and 1913, she is most positive in saying that the terracing was done and the hedge was started \u201cin the year following (our) entering the house.\u201d\nNow the record establishes beyond the shadow of a doubt that Mr. Bollard and his family moved into their house in October, 1911.\nThe effect of Mrs. Bollard\u2019s evidence is that the hedge and terracing were made in 1912. This is further strengthened by her recollection of an incident in connection with the death of her grandchild, Mrs. McPherson\u2019s daughter. It is common ground that the death occurred in July, 1913, and Mrs. Bollard recalls having picked some white flowers from the hedge and put them on the coffin. She adds: \u201cThat is what brings it to my memory.\u201d She is quite sure the hedge had then been planted for some time.\nLater in her testimony, she is asked whether she looked up any records about these dates or whether she had to rely entirely on memory. In her reply, she refers again to the same incident. Her answer is: \u201cOn my memory and what occurred that year.\u201d\nThe learned trial judge discarded altogether the evidence of Mrs. McPherson, which agrees on all material points with that of Mrs. Bollard. His ground was that \u201cshe has been discussing the matter with her mother and relies on her mother\u2019s memory for dates.\u201d That can only refer to two passages of Mrs. McPherson\u2019s testimony, where she says:\nQ. Did you look up any records that you might have?\u2014A. No, not at all.\nQ. So that you just talked it over with your mother, I suppose?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And you agreed with her, or who was it put it at 1912, would it be you or your mother?\u2014A. I think we both put it because we both knew.\nQ. Well, you both knew; you agreed that was the date?\u2014A. Absolutely.\n* * *\nQ. You did not speak about that at all with your mother, it was just question of the putting out of the hedge and this walk up here that you and your mother discussed?\u2014A. Yes, we discussed that.\nQ. And you cannot tell us who it was, which one of you first fixed date of 1912? Your mother says 1912 or 1913, she won\u2019t be sure which one it was?\u2014A. Well, I am just going by what I told you, the circumstances.\nQ. You are quite clear\u2014I do not want to be unfair\u2014you are quite clear that flowers, white flowers were picked from that hedge?\u2014A. No, I am not clear about that, my mother believed that she picked them but I know hedge was there.\nQ. Your mother told you?\u2014A. I know hedge was there.\nLike the Appellate Division, we are unable to find in the above passages and upon the ground put forward by the learned trial judge any justification for disregarding the evidence of Mrs. McPherson. The trial judge\u2019s estimate of the witnesses must of necessity lose much of its weight when, as here, he gives for such estimate reasons which, upon examination, are found unconvincing and unsatisfactory. Mrs. McPherson makes it distinctly clear that she speaks from her own recollection. Earlier in her deposition she had so stated:\nQ. Then when was the hedge set out?\u2014A. I should say 1912.\nQ. Do you remember your father doing the terracing?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. What year was that with relation to the year you went into the house?\u2014A. Well, I should say year after.\nQ. And were the hedge and the terracing done in different years or the same year?\u2014A. I should say same year, one may have been started in the spring and the other in the fall, I do not know about that, but I should say it was 1912.\n* * *\nQ. And would you say\u2014why did you say it was 1912?\u2014A. Well, I could say it was 1912 because my little girl died in 1913 and it was put in before that.\nQ. You have distinct recollection of that, have you?\u2014A. Yes. Unexpected corroboration of Mrs. Bollard and of Mrs. McPherson comes from the appellant\u2019s expert witness Brown. The grandmother testified that she plucked from the hedge white strays of spiraea to lay them on the coffin of the little girl. Brown stated that normally spiraea finished blooming by the end of June, but that the year 1913 was abnormally backward and it was possible for Mrs. Bollard to have picked those flowers in July, 1913.\nIf, therefore, as the learned trial judge rightly remarked, the respondent\u2019s possessory title \u201crests entirely on the evidence of Mrs. Bollard and her daughter, Mrs. McPherson,\u201d it follows that actual occupation by the respondent and his predecessor in title was conclusively established for more than ten years, for we do not find in the record any reason why their evidence should not be given its full weight on this point. The opinion of Brown, the expert nursery man, as to the age of the hedge, cannot overcome the evidential value of the testimony of eye-witnesses, otherwise unimpeachable, and who deposed to actual facts, as to which they were in no wise contradicted.\nWe are for these reasons, in accord with the Appellate Division. We find in the circumstances of this case the conditions which call for the application of s. 5 of The Limitations Act. Throughout the statutory period, the strip of land in dispute was continuously occupied by Bollard and his successor, the respondent, and, during that period, there was a discontinuance of possession by the predecessors in title of the appellants. Before the appellants purchased lot 40, the possession of the respondent, open and visible, unequivocal and exclusive, had already ripened into a possessory title.\nThe judgment appealed from should be confirmed with costs.\nThe judgment of Duff and Newcombe JJ. (dissenting), was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The action was begun on 7th December, 1923, claiming a declaration that the plaintiff (respondent) was the owner of the land in question, also an injunction and damages. The land consists of the narrow edge or strip, lying between the east line of the plaintiff\u2019s lot, no. 41 on Roxborough Street East, Toronto, and that part of a hedge planted by Mr. Bollard, the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in title, which is on no. 40, the adjoining lot to the eastward; the plaintiff claiming merely what he describes as a squatter\u2019s title.\nMr. Bollard built his house on lot 41 in 1910 and 1911. At that time the owners of lot 40 did not use it, either by themselves or by any person claiming under them. The possession in law, of course, was theirs, but it was not active or visible possession, and there is no evidence that the owners were in the neighbourhood. The land was in a rough condition; it is said to have been in a state of nature; there were surveyors\u2019 marks from which the lines could be traced, but there were and are no fences on either lot, except to the eastward of lot 40. The paper title, both of Bollard and the plaintiff, is confined to lot 41 as described in the survey, and does not include the land in dispute, or anything beyond the boundaries of the lot. When Mr. Bollard built, he had to provide access to his house from Roxborough Street on the south, that being the only highway contiguous to the property. The ground is steep, and, going northward from Roxborough Street, the grade increases. The house was located on the northeastern part of the lot, not far from the eastern line, and there were two entrances, one, the front, on the easterly, and the other, the rear, on the northerly, side of the house, from which the ground slopes gradually to the southeast. In constructing the approach, Mr. Bollard surmounted the grades at the foot by a flight of steps laid on the ground and leading up from the street, and, to avoid the steeper acclivity, which would otherwise have been encountered, he directed the path from the head of the steps at an abrupt angle to the northeast, crossing the line of lot 41, and, continuing northerly on lot 41, for a distance somewhat in excess of the length of the house, in a curve diverging slightly to the eastward as it advanced northward, whence, opposite the entrances to the house, he constructed two flights of steps, leading to the westward, whereby to reach the entrances, and he laid some boards on the path to provide better footing, which, after the plaintiff acquired the property he replaced by flags. The whole purpose and appearance of the structure was that of a footway of access and egress from and to the street. Later, at a time which is not definitely fixed by the proof, Mr. Bollard set out a hedge, of the variety known as bridal wreath, close to the path on its lower side, extending from a point on lot 41, below where the path intersected the line of the lot, northward, to the end of the path, somewhat beyond the steps leading to the rear entrance. The practical purpose of this hedge was protection to the path which ran along the face of a declivity; it served as a sort of baluster, and perhaps to stiffen and uphold the soil. It was moreover ornamental. The south end of the path was on the plaintiff\u2019s lot, the north on the defendants. It did not terminate at any boundary, and made no enclosure. The hedge is described by the plaintiff\u2019s surveyor as \u201cthick shrubbery\u2014quite thick; I should say it would be about two or three feet high, * * * about a foot and a half wide at the top when it was clipped off.\u201d\nAs to the time when the hedge was planted, there is the evidence of Mrs. Bollard, who lived in the house from October, 1911, to 1917, when her husband died, and continued to live there until 1919, when she sold to the plaintiff, and of her daughter, Mrs. McPherson, who lived in the house, with her mother, for the first four or five months, or until January or February, 1912, when she moved into her own house, which had been built on the same lot to the westward, and where she resided until 1919. These two ladies were called to prove the possession. Mrs. Bollard had looked for documents or records by which to refresh her memory, but could find none, and she says that she did not know what her husband or Mr. McPherson, her son-in-law, did. Mrs. McPherson says that she did not look for any records, but talked the matter over with her mother. In the conclusion, Mrs. Bollard thinks the hedge was planted in 1912 or 1913. Mrs. McPherson thinks it was planted in 1912. The reason influencing this conclusion, as given by Mrs. Bollard, is that the shrubs of the hedge bore a small white flower; that a child of Mrs. McPherson died in July, 1913, and that she, Mrs. Bollard, picked some white flowers and put them on the coffin. Therefore she concludes that the hedge was there before July, 1913. Mrs. McPherson also fixes the date by reference to the death of her child, but when asked, in cross-examination, if she were quite clear that the flowers were picked from the hedge she answered \u201cNo, I am not quite clear about that. My mother believed that she picked them, but I know the hedge was there.\u201d There is evidence that terracing was done somewhere between the wooden walk and the verandah, and that there were flowers growing by the verandah. At the time of the trial the boards on the path had been replaced by the flags. Mrs. Bollard thinks these were put down two or three years after the laying of the boards. She says that \u201cthe wooden sidewalk went sagging and my husband thought he would rather have the other (meaning the flagstones), and he put it here in this place exactly where the wooden sidewalk had been.\u201d Mrs. McPherson, in her direct examination, referring to the flagstone walk, says that it was in the same location as the wooden walk; that between the walk, first wooden and then flagstone, and the verandah, there was grass, and that there was nothing to indicate the boundary between lots 40 and 41, except the hedge. In her cross-examination she says she thinks the boards were there when her mother sold to the plaintiff in 1919, but does not know anything about that. In fact, as already told, the boards were taken up, and the flags put in their place, by the plaintiff, after he bought the place, in 1919.\nAs illustrating the manner in which the evidence of these ladies was elicited at the trial, the following conversation took place on the re-examination of Mrs. Bollard; Mr. Jennings for the plaintiff, Mr. White for the defendants:\nMr. JENNINGS: Q. Then following the entry in the house on October, 1911, when was it your husband began to terrace up the property?\u2014A. In 1912, I think, they started.\nQ. Then was the hedge set out in the year of the terracing?\u2014A. Yes, I think they did the whole work, as far as I can remember, I think the terrace started first.\nQ. And then in what year was the hedge, with reference to the terracing of the property?\u2014A. Well, 1912 or 1913, I can not just exactly say.\nQ. Terracing was done in the year following your entering the house?\u2014A. Yes, was started.\nQ. And I think you said\u2014I want you to be quite accurate\u2014the hedge was put out in the same year?\u2014A. Yes. Mr. WHITE: My learned friend should be fair with the witness, the witness said she could not say, 1912 or 1913, and the witness is perfectly fair and my learned friend is trying to pin her down to 1912.\nThe COURT: She said before it was in \u201913.\nMr. JENNINGS: No, Your Honour, she said it was same year in which the terracing was done, year following their occupation of the house. Perhaps Your Honour would ask her?\nThe COURT: Oh, no.\nMr. WHITE: I just want to ask a question about the terracing. Q. You will not say, will you, whether the terracing was done in 1912 or 1913?\u2014A. It was either one or the other, I could not say for sure, it was either \u201912 or \u201913.\nOn the other hand the plaintiff\u2019s surveyor, who made a survey and plan of the locality for the purposes of the action, and had previously, in 1917, also made a survey and plan of lot 41 for Mrs. Bollard\u2019s son-in-law, McPherson, did not show the hedge on the latter plan, although he says he thinks it likely that he would have shown it if it were there. His impression is that the hedge was not there. It is observable however, as affecting the inference to be drawn from this circumstance, that the plan of 1917 did not show the steps or the path, although these evidently were there when that survey was made. Mr. Brown, a landscape gardener, connected with the nursery business, in which he had had twenty-three years experience, examined the hedge in June, 1924, and produced a sample of it at the trial; he says that, having regard to the nature of the soil, the number of clippings and the condition and size of the wood, he considered the hedge to be about six years of age, if, according to the usual practice, it had been planted at three years growth. The learned County Judge was much impressed by the evidence of this witness, whom he found both capable and honest.\nBut assuming the hedge to have been planted in 1912 or 1913, what follows? The hedge is not, and was not, intended to be definitive of any line, or to mark the limit of any occupation. It runs diagonally across the surveyor\u2019s line, part of it is on the plaintiff\u2019s land, though the greater part of it is on the defendants\u2019 land. It includes nothing and it excludes nothing. It is, as I see it, of even less value to prove possession of a part of the defendants\u2019 land than a single tree would have been, if planted there by the plaintiff and allowed to grow for ten years, because the hedge had an obvious purpose explaining its existence and use. It was made to buttress the walk along the side hill, and that was the useful purpose for which it was maintained. It is, in the circumstances attendant upon its situation and use, meaningless as evidence of exclusive possession of the soil.\nTo the west of the footpath there was still a narrow margin belonging to lot 40. The evidence is to the effect that there was grass growing there, and that Mr. Bollard used to trim it and also the hedge, but the time is not fixed. The surface must have been in a somewhat rough condition during 1912 and 1913 when, according to the case, the terracing and improvements were going on. The evidence is not clear or definite, and it would, I think, be unsafe to regard it as initiating a period of prescription for the title during either of those years. What Lord Lindley said in Littledale v. Liverpool College[6], may fairly be repeated with respect to the owners of lot 40.\nThey could not be dispossessed unless the plaintiffs obtained possession themselves; and possession by the plaintiffs involved an animus possidendi\u2014i.e., occupation with the intention of excluding the owner as well as other people.\nThere is nothing which points to an intent to exclude.\nThe learned County Judge, who delivered a carefully considered judgment, found that the time of the planting of the hedge had not been established to his satisfaction; that Mrs. Bollard\u2019s memory was defective, and that Mrs. McPherson, who had been discussing the matter with her mother, had relied upon the latter for her dates; that the hedge was not planted as a boundary line, but, in his view, for ornamental purposes only, and that Mr. Bollard must have known that he was a trespasser; that the use of the footpath was evidence only of prescription for a right of way, and that the user had not been sufficiently prolonged to establish it. He accordingly dismissed the action.\nThe Appellate Division reversed this judgment upon a review of the evidence, and held that the plaintiff had obtained title to the land lying to the west of the centre of the hedge by possession; relying upon the evidence of Mrs. Bollard and Mrs. McPherson with regard to the picking of the flowers as conclusively establishing the existence of the hedge prior to that date. But, with all due respect, I am unable to accept this view. It would be natural, and I do not doubt, that Mrs. Bollard picked some white flowers for her granddaughter\u2019s funeral, but that she picked these from the hedge is nowhere stated in the evidence, although perhaps she thought she did, and not improbably she would have said so if she had been asked; but there were flowers growing on the premises nearer to the house, and I do not think that Mrs. Bollard\u2019s memory as to the plucking of the flowers ought to be accepted as proving the existence of the hedge at that time. It is as little conclusive as the rest of her evidence. The old lady\u2019s recollection was admittedly at fault, and the trial judge gained the impression that her daughter, having less opportunity to know or to observe, was influenced by what her mother told her. It cannot be denied that the learned judge\u2019s estimate of the witnesses forms a substantial part of his reasons for judgment, and, if so, the observations of Lord Sumner in the House of Lords in the recent case of SS. Hontestroom v. SS. Sagaporack and SS. Durham Castle[7], become very apposite to the case. His Lordship, in addressing the House, said:\nWhat then is the real effect on the hearing in a court of appeal of the fact that the trial judge saw and heard the witnesses? I think it has been somewhat lost sight of. Of course, there is jurisdiction to retry the case on the shorthand note, including in such retrial the appreciation of the relative values of the witnesses, for the appeal is made a rehearing by rules which have the force of statute; Order LXVIII, r. 1. It is not, however, a mere matter of discretion to remember and take account of this fact; it is a matter of justice and of judicial obligation. None the less, not to have seen the witnesses puts appellate judges in a permanent position of disadvantage as against the trial judge, and, unless it can be shown that he has failed to use or has palpably misused his advantage, the higher court ought not to take the responsibility of reversing conclusions so arrived at, merely on the result of their own comparisons and criticisms of the witnesses and of their own view of the probabilities of the case. The course of the trial and the whole substance of the judgment must be looked at, and the matter does not depend on the question whether a witness has been cross-examined to credit or has been pronounced by the judge in terms to be unworthy of it. If his estimate of the man forms any substantial part of his reasons for his judgment the trial judge\u2019s conclusions of fact should, as I understand the decisions, be let alone.\nIn the result, I do not think a case has been made out to justify the setting aside of the findings.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: George T.

The bond was renewed yearly, the last renewal being for the year beginning 1st October, 1922. The collector received payment of taxes in currency or cheques. From time to time, usually daily, he handed to a clerk or placed in the cash books for entry such of the receipted tax bills as he desired to account for at that time. These were in due course entered in the cash books. The total amount of the bills so entered was made up, and the collector then gave the clerk a corresponding amount in cheques and currency, for which the clerk made out a deposit slip, which, with the cheques and currency, was handed to the city treasurer whose duty it was to make the bank deposits. From the collector\u2019s cash books the payments thus recorded were credited in the ledger accounts of the various taxpayers in payment of whose accounts they had been attributed. On 19th September, 1922, R., a taxpayer, paid two cheques which were deposited by or on behalf of the collector with the treasurer on 21st and 28th September. On 26th January, 1923, B., a taxpayer, paid a cheque which was deposited with the treasurer on 30th January. Except as to a portion of B.\u2019s cheque, the collector did not give credit in his books to R. and B. for these payments, but appropriated the cheques in payment of other taxes which had already been paid, and for which he had issued receipted bills; but the taxpayers\u2019 money which the collector received in payment of these other taxes was not credited to their accounts in his cash books; instead, R.\u2019s cheque, and B.\u2019s cheque in part, were deposited so that it was made to appear that taxes other than those of R. and B. had been paid by their cheques, the collector suppressing the evidence that their taxes had been paid. The city claimed against defendant (up to the amount guaranteed) for misappropriations by the collector to the amount of the cheques of R. and B. not properly credited. Notice had been given defendant of the embezzlements or thefts, on 2nd June, 1923. The bond provided that no more than one claim, and that only in (respect of acts of embezzlement or theft committed within 12 months (prior to notice to defendant of discovery thereof should be made.\nHeld, as to the contention that there was no evidence of embezzlement or theft within said twelve months period, that it should be found or inferred that there was embezzlement or theft of the sums misappropriated on the dates when the cheques of R. and B. were by the collector\u2019s direction used and deposited with the treasurer to make up the credits for which they were not intended; that, in the absence of proof to the contrary, it should be found that the city then sustained pecuniary loss to the amount so misappropriated, by reason of embezzlement or theft by the collector in connection with his duties; there was prima facie, if not conclusive, proof of misappropriation at the time of the false accounting; if defendant relied upon an earlier date for the offence than that prima facie proved, it should have adduced evidence of it.\nIt was the appropriation of the cheques of R. and B. to the payment of the accounts which the collector knew had been otherwise satisfied by money in his hands, that constituted the commission of the crime, and its proof. Rex v. Hodgson (3 C. & P. 422 at p. 424) and other cases, referred to.\nHeld further, as to the contention that the R. and B. cheques, having been actually delivered to the treasurer and deposited in the city\u2019s bank account, thus reaching their intended and proper destination, were not misappropriated, and that, therefore, any charges of default or loss alleged by the particulars of the statement of claim failed, that, although the particulars were lacking in some allegations necessary fully to explain the nature of the case, yet in view of a previous explanatory letter by the city\u2019s solicitor to defendant, and the evidence and the course of the trial, the contention should not prevail; an amendment, if necessary, should be allowed.\nHeld further, that, in view of the terms of the bond, the provision to indemnify as to embezzlement or theft \u201ccommitted during the continuance of this agreement, and discovered during the continuance of this agreement,\u201d covered embezzlement or theft committed before, but discovered after, the renewal of the bond on 1st October, 1922.\nHeld further, as to complaint respecting certain answers by the city to questions submitted with regard to the proposed guaranty, which answers, along with others, were to be taken as \u201cthe basis of the contract,\u201d that, taking into consideration that, although the questions were not fully answered, the answers were accepted by defendant, and taking into consideration all the questions and answers made, including some made later, in 1918, relative to a renewal of the bond, and under all the circumstances and evidence, the answers complained of, when given a reasonable interpretation, could not be relied on to prevent recovery under the bond.\nHeld further, as to defendant\u2019s contention that it was discharged because the city had dispensed with certain duties of office with which the collector was charged by statute, that the contention, failed for lack of proof; that, although there was great neglect in enforcing the statutory requirement of a monthly return, the evidence did not satisfy the condition to the discharge of a surety affirmed in Black v. Ottoman Bank (6 L.T.N.S. 763) that there must be some positive act done by the employer to the surety\u2019s prejudice, or such degree of negligence as to imply connivance and amount to fraud; moreover, on the evidence, the statutory requirements did not influence the making of the agreement; and under it their performance was neither represented nor expressly or impliedly undertaken by the city; there was no evidence of fraudulent concealment, or of suppression of any fact which the city was bound to communicate Da vis v. London and Provincial Marine & Ins. Co. (8 Ch. D. 469) referred to.\nHeld further, as to a clause in the bond avoiding it if the city should fail to notify defendant \u201cof the discovery of any writ of attachment, execution issued, or judgment obtained against the salary or property of the employee\u201d as soon as it became known to the city, that the judgment in question did not appear to have been one \u201cobtained against the salary or property of the employee\u201d, moreover doubt was expressed that the city could be held to have discovered a judgment merely because the city auditor in the course of business heard of it.\nHeld, generally, as to the effect of the city\u2019s conduct on defendant\u2019s liability, the principle affirmed in MacTaggart v. Watson (3 Cl. & F. 525 at pp. 542, 543) should be applied.\nJudgment of Chisholm J., of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in favour of the city, affirmed.\nAnglin C.J.C. dissented, on the ground that, certainly no moneys received from the R. and B. cheques mentioned in the city\u2019s particulars of claim were embezzled or stolen or lost to the city; and even on amendment of the particulars to accord with the statements in the city solicitor\u2019s previous letter to defendant, the claim so amended being regarded as based upon the embezzlements or thefts which the false entries in the books as to the proceeds of said cheques were designed to cover up, yet the actual embezzlements or thefts should not be taken prima facie to have occurred when said falsification of the books took place, nor did the proof of such falsification cast the burden on defendant to show that the actual embezzlements or thefts occurred at earlier dates; the city was required to establish loss within the terms of the guarantee; and without evidence warranting a finding that the moneys were actually embezzled or stolen within the 12 months period prior to notice of discovery, according to the limitation in the bond, the city could not recover.\nAPPEAL, per saltum, from the judgment of Chisholm J., of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, holding the plaintiff city entitled to recover against the defendant under a bond or agreement to indemnify the city against pecuniary loss (to the extent of $10,000), sustained by reason of embezzlement or theft of money on the part of a collector of taxes employed by the city. The material facts of the case, and questions dealt with are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note. The appeal was dismissed with costs, Anglin C.J.C. dissenting.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the appellant.\nF. H. Bell K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The London Guarantee & Accident Company, Limited, agreed in writing with the city of Halifax to make good and reimburse to the city, to the extent of $10,000, such pecuniary loss, if any, as might be sustained by the city by reason of embezzlement or theft of money by the collector of taxes in connection with his duties. Losses, due to embezzlement or theft on the part of the collector, were alleged by the city, in excess of the amount for which the company had become surety; the liability was denied, and the city recovered judgment at the trial, in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, against the company, in the sum of $10,000. The company now appeals, per saltum, to this court.\nThe agreement, or bond, as it is called, upon which the action is brought, is dated 20th June, 1907, and is described <as replacing bond no. 10855. It redites that Robert Theakston has been appointed collector of taxes in the service of the city, and has applied to the company \u201cfor a grant by them of this agreement.\u201d Two other recitals follow, namely:\nAnd whereas the employer has delivered to the company certain statements and a declaration, setting forth, among other things, the duties, responsibilities and remuneration of the employee, the moneys to be entrusted to him, and the safeguards and checks kept and to be kept upon his accounts, and has consented that such declaration and each and every other of the statements therein referred to or contained, so far as the same are material to the contract, shall form the basis of the contract hereinafter expressed to be made;\nAnd whereas the employer warrants the statements and declaration aforesaid, so far as the same are material to this contract, to be true, and agrees that the method of conducting the business, so far as the said statements and declaration are concerned, shall be in accordance therewith during the currency of this agreement (except as to such changes therein as may be agreed to by the company as hereinafter provided). Then it is stipulated as follows:\nIt is hereby agreed and declared that from the date hereof, up to the first day of October, 1907, at 12 o\u2019clock noon, and during any year thereafter, in respect of which the company shall consent to renew this agreement by accepting the aforesaid annual premium, and issuing a renewal receipt as hereinafter provided subject to the provisions of the memorandum and articles of association of the said company, and to the conditions and provisoes herein contained (which shall be conditions precedent to the right on the part of the employer to recover under this agreement), the company shall, at the expiration of three months next after proof satisfactory to the directors of the loss hereinafter mentioned has been given to the company, make good and reimburse to the employer to the extent of the sum of ten thousand dollars, and no further, such pecuniary, loss, if any, as may be sustained by the employer by reason of embezzlement or theft of money on the part of the employee in connection with the duties hereinbefore referred to, committed during the continuance of this agreement, and discovered during the continuance of this agreement, in the case of the death, dismissal, or retirements of the employee discovered, within three months from the death, dismissal or retirement. And no more than one claim, and that only in respect of acts of embezzlement or theft of money committed within twelve months, prior to the receipt by the company of the notice of discovery thereof, to be given as is hereinafter provided, shall be made under this agreement, which upon the making of such claim, as to any further or other liability hereunder, wholly cease and determine, and upon the payment of such claim this agreement shall be delivered up to be cancelled; * * * Provided that on discovery of any embezzlement or theft of money by the employee as aforesaid, the employer shall immediately give notice in writing thereof to the company, and that full particulars of any claim made under this agreement shall be given in writing addressed to the manager of the company, for the Dominion of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, within three months after such discovery as aforesaid: * * * This agreement is entered into on the condition that the business of the employer shall continue to be conducted and the duties and (except that it may be increased) the remuneration of the employee and the method of examining and checking his accounts shall remain in every particular in accordance with the statements and declaration hereinbefore referred to, and if during the continuance of this agreement any circumstance shall occur or change be made, either temporarily or otherwise, which shall have the effect of making the actual facts materially differ from such statements or any of them, without notice in writing thereof being given to the company at its chief office for Canada and the consent or approval in writing of the company being obtained, or if any suppression or misstatement of any material fact affecting the risk of the company be made at the time of the payment of the first or of any subsequent premium, or if the employer shall continue to entrust the employee with money or valuable property after having discovered any act of dishonesty on his part, or shall fail to notify the company of the discovery of any such act as hereinbefore provided (for which the company would be liable under the terms of this agreement) or of any writ of attachment execution issued or judgment obtained against the salary or property of the employee as soon as it shall have come to the knowledge of the employer, or if the employer make any settlement with the employee for any loss hereunder without the consent in writing of the company having first been obtained, then, and in every such case, this agreement shall be void and of no effect from the beginning, and all premiums paid thereon shall be forfeited to the company.\nThere is also this further provision:\nProvided that if the company shall renew this agreement beyond the time herein limited and shall issue a renewal receipt to that effect this agreement shall be continued for the time therein specified and the statements, warranties and conditions made as aforesaid shall, except as materially varied by any statement, in writing, made at the time of such renewal and endorsed thereon or hereon, be deemed to be continued and of full force and effect as herein provided during the continuance of this agreement so renewed as aforesaid and together with such variations as aforesaid to form the basis of such renewal which shall be deemed to have been made upon the faith of such statements, warranties and conditions so varied as aforesaid.\nThe agreement was renewed from year to year, the last renewal being for the year beginning 1st October, 1922. The loss is alleged in the statement of claim, by the 6th paragraph, as follows:\n6. During the period covered by such renewals the plaintiff city has suffered loss by the defalcation or theft of moneys by the said Robert Theakston to an amount exceeding the sum of $10,000 the particulars of which said loss are as follows:\n(1) The sum of $7,398 which was paid to the said Robert Theakston, as such collector, on the 19th day of September, 1922, by one James E. Roy, a taxpayer of the plaintiff city, as and for taxes due by him to the the plaintiff city and was misappropriated and stolen by the Said Robert Theakston.\n(2) The sum of $4,303.54 which was paid to the said Robert Theakston, as such collector, on the 26th day of January, 1923, by one Charles Brister, a taxpayer of the plaintiff city, as and for taxes due by him to the plaintiff city and was misappropriated and stolen by the said Robert Theakston.\nThe facts brought out under these particulars had been stated substantially in a letter of 1st August, 1923, written by the city solicitor to the company\u2019s manager at Toronto. In this letter Mr. Bell states:\nIn compliance with the requirements of your bond to the city of Halifax, No. 70275, guaranteeing Mr. Robert Theakston, collector of the city, I beg herewith to submit a claim for an amount exceeding the sum guaranteed, namely, ten thousand dollars ($10,000) misappropriated by him during the twelve months preceding the date of the discovery of his defalcations, namely, the 2nd of June, 1923. I may say that the total amount of the defalcations already known to have been committed by him is greatly in excess of this amount. We have now proof of about seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) taken by him and further amounts are being discovered almost daily, as the work of auditing proceeds. The amounts making up the sum above mentioned are:\n(1) Amount of payment made by J. E. Roy on Sept. 19,\n1922 for taxes for civic year 1921-22, paid by two\ncheques of that date, one for four thousand dollars\n($4,000) and one for three thousand three hundred and\nninety-eight dollars ($3,398)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 $7,398 00\n(2) Amount of part payment made by Charles Brister on\nJanuary 26, 1923, for taxes. Payment was made by a\ncheque of that date for six thousand one hundred\nthirty-seven dollars and twenty-three cents ($6,137.23)\nof which only one thousand eight hundred thirty-three\ndollars and sixty-nine cents ($1,833.69) was credited\nand paid to the treasurer, the balance being\nmisappropriated\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 $4,303 54\n$11,701 54\nIt will be noted that what is claimed is the amount indicated by the cheques. This is to avoid confusion. The cheques themselves were passed over by the collector to the treasurer. But, as only the amounts shown by the collector\u2019s cash book were ever paid to the treasurer and as with the exception of the amount credited to Mr. Brister, as above stated, neither the amounts covered by the cheques nor the persons by whom they were paid were entered in the cash book, it is clear that the collector misappropriated currency to the amount of the cheques, and substituted for it the cheques, which he was compelled to do in order to pass them through the bank, with the endorsation of the city upon them.\nI enclose copies of these cheques referred to; Mr. Roy has also his receipts in the usual form, Mr. Brister has no receipt and states that the collector at the time of payment said none was necessary. Both Mr. Brister and Mr. Roy are here and well known and are available at any time to any representative of your company.\nIf you require anything further, we shall be pleased to furnish it if in our power.\nThe action was brought on 9th November, 1923, and was tried before Chisholm J. The first objection to his findings is that the plaintiff failed to prove any pecuniary loss by reason of embezzlement or theft by the employee. It appears that the city collector, according to the course of business in his office, received payment of the taxes levied by the city for various purposes; that these taxes were paid, sometimes in money, sometimes by taxpayers\u2019 cheques; that the collector himself had the custody of the money and the cheques; that from time to time, usually every day, the collector handed out to one of his clerks or assistants, or placed in the cash books for entry, such of the receipted tax bills as he desired to account for at that time; that these were in due course entered in the appropriate cash books; that the total amount of the bills so entered was made up, and that the collector then gave to the clerk a corresponding amount in cheques and money. Thereupon the clerk made out a deposit slip, specifying the amount of the cheques and the Currency, and this deposit slip, with the cheques and currency, was handed over to the city treasurer, whose duty it was to make the bank deposits. From the cash books in the collector\u2019s office the payments thus recorded were credited in the ledger accounts of the various taxpayers in payment of whose accounts they had been attributed. What happened with regard to the cheques in question was this: James E. Roy, a large taxpayer, paid his taxes by two cheques, the one of $4,000, the other of $3,398, on 19th September, 1922, and these cheques were deposited by or on behalf of the collector with the treasurer on the 21st and 28th of that month. Charles Brister, also a large taxpayer, paid his taxes by his cheque for $6,137.23 on 26th January, 1923, which was in like manner deposited with the treasurer, four days later. These cheques were paid in discharge of taxes of various kinds, and divers amounts; but Mr. Roy received no credit; and while, as to an amount of $1,833.69, part of Mr. Brister\u2019s cheque, the payment was attributed to the account of the latter in the collector\u2019s books, he did not receive credit for the balance of $4,303.54. Therefore, except as to the $1,833.69, none of these cheques was used by the collector for the purposes for which it had been paid in. On the contrary, the collector appropriated the cheques in payment of other taxes which had already been paid, and for which he had regularly issued receipted bills; but the taxpayers\u2019 money which was received by the collector in payment of these other taxes was not credited to their accounts in any of the cash books. Instead, Roy\u2019s cheque, and that of Brister in part, were deposited so that it was made to appear that taxes other than those of Roy and Brister had been paid by their cheques, the collector suppressing the evidence that their taxes had been paid. It is urged against the findings that, while these facts constitute proof of embezzlement, there is no evidence of the time when the offence took place; but from the foregoing facts I think it may be found or inferred that there was embezzlement, or, having regard to the provisions of the Criminal Code, theft, of the sums misappropriated by the collector, on the dates when these cheques were by his direction used and deposited with the treasurer to make up the credits for which they were not intended; and I think it may be found moreover, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that the city then sustained pecuniary loss, to the amount so misappropriated, by reason of embezzlement or theft of money on the part of the collector in connection with his duties. The failure to account for the money which the taxpayers had paid in discharge of their tax bills; the appropriation of the Roy and Brister cheque to the payment of these bills, and the omission to give credit to Roy and Brister for the cheques which they had paid, save as to $1,833.69, part of Brister\u2019s cheque, afford the necessary evidence. It is said that the time of the defalcation is, by the terms of the guaranty, material, and that the use of the cheques does not fix the time. There is however no evidence to fix the collector with criminal responsibility at any time earlier than the dates of deposit of the cheques with the treasurer; that was the act upon which the court could find with certainty an intention to misappropriate. It showed that the cheques paid in by Roy and Brister were applied by the collector in payment of taxes which had already been paid, the money which actually went to pay those taxes not having been accounted for, and therefore a falsification of the accounts. There was thus, prima facie, if not conclusive, proof of misappropriation at the time of the false accounting. When, therefore, the defendant company relies upon an earlier date for the offence than that which is prima facie proved, I think it must adduce evidence of it, but it has not done so.\nThere is a well known series of decisions with regard to venue in prosecutions for embezzlement, which includes such cases as Rex v. Taylor[1]; Reg. v. Murdoch[2], and Reg. v. Rogers[3], where it is held that the act of embezzlement is completed at the place where the representation is made which makes out the offence. When an agent collects money for his principal and fails promptly to account or remit, that fact does not establish the charge against him. But his innocence is incompatible with, a false account, and, in this case, it was the appropriation of Roy and Brister\u2019s cheques to the payment of the accounts which the collector knew had been otherwise satisfied by money in his hands that constituted the commission of the crime, and its proof. Rex v. Hodgson[4].\nTherefore I shall proceed upon the view that on 21st September, 1922, the collector misappropriated $4,000; on 28th September, 1922, $3,398; and on 30th January, 1923, $4,303.54, and that the city had, when the action was brought, sustained the loss of these several amounts.\nIt is said that, inasmuch as the cheques of Roy and Brister were actually delivered to the city treasurer, who deposited them to the credit of the city in its bank account, these cheques, having reached their intended and proper destination, were not misappropriated, and therefore that the only charges of default and loss alleged by the particulars of the statement of claim fail. It is true that the particulars are lacking in some allegations which are necessary fully to explain the nature of the case, but these are supplied by the letter of 1st August, 1923, which I have quoted, and which preceded the delivery of the particulars by several months, and, in view of the explanation made by the letter, I can see no ground to suppose that the defendant was misled by the plaintiff\u2019s pleading or particulars. The case as stated by the letter, was proved at the trial, so far as necessary for the purposes of this action, and the witnesses were cross-examined upon it, and, if it be necessary to expand the particulars in order to state the additional facts comprised in the letter, I would see no injustice in allowing an amendment for the purpose of making the pleading correspond with the facts in proof. But, in view of the course of the trial, I am disposed to think that such an amendment is unnecessary.\nAttention is directed to the fact that the Roy cheques were deposited with the treasurer on 21st and 28th September, 1922, and that, under the terms of the agreement, the company is to indemnify the city only with respect to embezzlement or theft of money on the part of the employee\ncommitted during the continuance of this agreement, and discovered during the continuance of this agreement,\nand it is urged that since the agreement, which was in force during the year 1921-22, terminated on 30th September, 1922, before which date the embezzlement or theft, as to the Roy cheques, had taken place though not discovered until later, the agreement was not continuing, notwithstanding the fact that it was renewed for the year beginning 1st October, 1922. That contention is not, however, consistent with the fair interpretation of the agreement, which, by its express terms, provides for renewal by con-lent, and the issuing of renewal receipts. The phrase\ncommitted, during the continuance of this agreement and discovered during the continuance of this agreement\nobviously must refer, not only to the original term of the agreement, but also to the subsequent years for which it was renewed in manner provided for by the agreement. In one of the subsequent provisions, which I have quoted, there is a clause providing\nthat if the company shall renew this agreement beyond the time herein limited, and shall issue a renewal receipt to that effect this agreement shall be continued for the time therein specified.\nThis describes expressly the condition which existed with relation to the agreement during the year beginning 1st October, 1922, and nothing could more clearly evince an intention that the continuance of the agreement extended to that year.\nReference is also made to the questions submitted on behalf of the company with regard to the proposed guaranty. There are two sets of these, the first bearing date 7th October, 1902, signed by Mr. Crosby, the mayor. The acting manager of the company had submitted a printed form requesting a reply to questions which were listed, and stating that\nyour answers and the declaration hereto will form the basis of the contract between you and this company.\nAmong the questions were the following, and the answers quoted were returned:\nD. How often do you require him to pay over to you and is he then allowed to retain a balance in hand? If so, how much? And do you see that he has that amount in his possession?\u2014Ans. Daily.\nE. How often do you inspect the office and balance your cash book, and check the entries with vouchers and bank pass book?\u2014Ans. Daily. F. How often do you balance your books and what are your checks to discover any irregularity on the part of the proposer?\u2014Ans. Daily.\nAt the foot of the list is a statement in the following words, which I take to constitute the declaration referred to in the printed form with which the questions were submitted:\nThe above answers are to be taken as the basis of the contract between the employer and the London Guarantee & Accident Company, Limited.\nIt will be perceived that these questions are not fully answered, but the answers were accepted by the company; and, interpreting D. as a statement that the collector is required to pay over to the city daily; E. that the cash book is balanced and the entries checked with vouchers daily, and F. that the books are balanced daily, the evi\u00addence is sufficient to establish a practice to that effect. As to inspecting the office however, which is one of the subjects of inquiry in E., if this refer to inspection by the city auditor, or an individual not employed in the collector's office, there is no proof of any, except the inspection which was carried out monthly by the city auditor. Now it would seem that question E. taken by itself, with the answer \"daily,\" may involve an assurance that there is a daily in\u00adspection of the office, but it is necessary to read all the ques\u00adtions and answers together; and G., question and answer, reads thus:\nWhen was the office last inspected and were matters all satisfactory then?\u2014Ans.: 30th September. Yes.\nThe whole list is dated, as appears at the foot of it, 7th October, 1902. Afterwards, during the year 1918, further questions were submitted relative to renewal of the guar\u00adanty. The last two of these bear upon the point now under consideration. They are, with their answers:\nWhen were his books or stock last checked and audited and up to what date?\u2014Ans.: 1st May, 1918.\nWere all things found correct?\u2014Ans.: Yes.\nThis statement is dated 27th May, 1918, showing a lapse of 26 days since any check and audit had been made. More\u00adover there is in evidence a letter of 22nd September, 1921, from A. M. Jack & Son, the general agents of the company at Halifax, to Mr. Weir, its general manager at Toronto, reading as follows:\nWe duly received your favour of the 12th instant in connection with Mr. Robert Theakstpn, City Collector, insured under guarantee bond No. 702075, and in reply thereto beg to state that Mr. Theakston is still able to perform his duties satisfactorily and to all appearances enjoys the full confidence of the city officials. We are advised that Mr. Theakston\u2019s accounts are audited every month by the City Auditor and we do not know of any reason why you should not continue this bond. We might say that although Mr. Theakston is, as you state, over seventy years of age, still he is very active indeed and in lull possession of his faculties.\nMr. Weir\u2019s letter, which is acknowledged in the opening line, is not produced; but, when it was written, the time] for renewal of the Theakston guaranty was close at hand. It may be inferred that the general manager was inquiring, having regard to the collector\u2019s age, as to the expediency of renewing the agreement, and as to the auditing of accounts. He is informed that the accounts are audited every month by the city auditor. It was in these circumstances, and upon the information to which I have alluded, that the company renewed the agreement for the years beginning 1st October, 1921, and 1922. The question is, how are these inquiries and answers, which by the stipulations of the agreement are, so far as material, warranted true to be construed? It appears to me not supposable that the mayor, in his answers of 7th October, 1902, using the verb in the same sense, intended to say that the city inspected the office daily, and also that it had not been inspected for a week. Moreover it seems difficult to imagine that the company was relying upon daily inspection, when told that, between 30th September and 7th October, 1902, there had been no inspection, and later, when informed, on 27th May, 1918, that the books had been last checked and audited on and up to 1st May. One must endeavour to poach a reasonable interpretation, realizing that the questions were framed by the company; that they are in some cases not very applicable to a municipality, and that the company has, without demur, accepted the answers, such as they are, returned by the city. In considering the question,\nHow often do you inspect the office and balance your cash book and check the entries with vouchers and bank pass book?\nit may be observed, by the way, that the bank pass book affords no check for the collector\u2019s office, as the collector deposited with the treasurer, and it was the latter who carried on the banking business; the collector had no bank pass book. The word \u201cinspect\u201d is used in connection with the balancing of the cash book and the checking of the entries with vouchers, and it may not improbably have been considered that, when the cash book entries were balanced and checked, the office was inspected. There is an independent question, G., which is confined to inspection, and which evidently was answered upon the understanding that it referred to inspection by the city auditor, which took place at the end of the month, and which, as required by City Ordinance, No. 3, sec. 2, was to be made monthly. I think it reasonable to suppose that \u201cinspect,\u201d in E., was regarded on both sides as affording a general description: of which the particulars are stated in what follows, namely \u201cbalance your cash book and check the entries with vouchers.\u201d In any ease, reading E. and G. together, it is plain that if \u201cinspect\u201d in E. and \u201cinspected\u201d in G., with relation to the office, refer to the same operation, the office was not, upon fair construction, represented to have been inspected daily, unless in the manner which I have indicated; and, having regard to the subsequent information which the company obtained from the city, it seems apparent that the company either so understood, or did not attach materiality to the use of the word \u201cinspect\u201d in E. It did not allege any inconsistency between the two questions, nor did it call for any explanation in order to reconcile them. In these Circumstances, I do not find it necessary further to consider the effect of the renewals of 1921 and 1922, as based upon the information, which the company had obtained by special inquiry, that the collector\u2019s accounts were audited monthly by the city auditor; but, it seems unlikely that, when the company accepted the premiums and renewed the contract upon the representation that the inspection was monthly, it intended to tolerate the inequitable contention that the policy was void for neglect of daily inspection.\nAnother point arises in this way. Theakston had been tried and convicted of theft upon indictment, and, by agreement of counsel at the trial of the present action, the defendant introduced some extracts from the notes of the evidence taken in the criminal cause; among others the following from Mr. Foster, the city auditor:\nQ. Section 321, page 94 (cap. 67, 1913, of Nova Scotia) says in connection with the duties of the collector: \u201cHe shall every month make a return to the council: (a) of the amount of rates and taxes, including water fates, collected by him, specifying the name of each ratepayer or taxpayer with the amounts paid by him, and (b) of the aggregate amount of rates and taxes and of such water rates respectively remaining uncollected.\u201d\nQ. Do you as city auditor, and with reference to the term you have served as such, remember any such statement as that having been made to the council by the collector?\u2014A. Away back when I first went in it was done.\nQ. And subsequently to that it was not done?\u2014A. Instead of getting help he was eased of that amount of work by the council.\nQ. The board of control had office during that period, too?\u2014A. I will not be sure about the time the easement was given.\nand, from Mr. Murphy, the mayor:\nQ. Was it within your time as a member of the city council either as alderman, controller or mayor, that the rendering of the city collector\u2019s statement as called for by the Charter was dispensed with?\u2014A. Before my time, during my eleven or twelve years in the council there has never been such a statement presented; it has been asked for by resolution on more than one occasion.\nQ. And the reply has been that the work cannot be done with the staff that is there?\u2014A. I don\u2019t know the reply but the request was never complied with. That would be a reasonable assumption that would be the reply.\nQ. Will you say as a matter of fact you never heard that reply made?\u2014A. I would not say; probably I have heard it made; it would be the most reasonable reply that would be expected.\nQ. You say all the time you have been there such a statement has never been presented?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Was the advisability considered of giving the collector sufficient clerical force to enable that statement to be made?\u2014A. I don\u2019t think the question of lacking sufficient help entered into it except the last two or three years; I think the requests were entirely ignored.\nQ. When were they first made?\u2014A. I think on one occasion I myself, and I think on a second occasion Alderman Godwin, presented resolutions asking for information called for under certain sections of the Charter, to be rendered by the collector. I cannot say just when it was. In Alderman Godwin\u2019s case I think it was four or five years ago, not more.\nAnd it is said that here is evidence of dispensation by the city of duties of office with which the collector was charged by statute; that the surety was entitled to rely upon the performance by the city authorities of their statutory duties, and that, by the license or connivance of the city council in the neglect of the collector to make monthly returns to the council, the surety was discharged. In support of this argument the appellant relies upon the Scotch case of Mein v. Hardie[5]. That, however, as stated in the leading judgment, was not a case of mere omission, but of employment of a trustee in a way not sanctioned by the statute. There are also other distinctions, and reasons why this case does not apply, which might be mentioned, but the point must fail for lack of proof, and the other grounds which I am going to mention. Mr. Foster had stated that he was city auditor in 1922, and for a long time previously He speaks of the occurrence as \u201c away back when I first went in.\u201d He cannot fix the time. Mr. Murphy had been in the service of the city, as alderman, controller or mayor, for 11 or 12 years, and, if the council ever had dispensed with the monthly statement, it was before his time. Indeed during that period, the council had been endeavouring unsuccessfully to obtain such a statement. If, as said by Mr. Foster, the collector, at an indefinite though remote time, was eased of the work connected with the monthly return by the council, one would like to see the evidence of it. It is unlikely that the council would, attempt to sanction the breach of a statutory requirement. The presumption is against it. If the council did commit itself, the decision should have been mentioned in the minutes, but nothing was produced. Moreover when Mr. Foster gave the evidence, he was speaking in the criminal case, where the present issue was not involved, and what he said does not amount to proof that the council consented to dispense with the monthly statement. It was amply proved that there was great neglect in enforcing the provision which required the monthly return, but I see no evidence to satisfy, the condition to the discharge of a surety affirmed by Lord Kingsdown in the Privy Council, in Black v. Ottoman Bank[6]:\nthat there must be some positive act doue by him (the employer) to the prejudice of the surety, or such degree of negligence as in the language of Wood V.C. in Dawson v. Lawes[7], to imply connivance, and amount to fraud.\nIt remains to be said upon this point that there is no evidence that the incident which Mr. Foster had in mind occurred after the giving of the guaranty, and that Mr. Weir, who had been manager of the defendant company for 10 or 11 years, and who had previously been assistant for four years, disclaims any knowledge of the requirements of the l\u00e9gislation relating to the city of Halifax. Evidently, in fact, these did not influence the making of the agreement The suretyship agreement is not conditioned! for the due performance of the collector\u2019s duties of office. The indemnity is promised only for embezzlement or theft in connection with the duties referred to in the recitals, but these do not mention or include the statutory duties, and, according to my interpretation of the agreement, the performance of these is neither represented not expressly or impliedly undertaken by the city. Moreover the questions and answers in the proposals for the policy entirely ignore the requirements of the statute.\nIt is suggested that there was suppression of material facts with relation to the statutory requirements and the manner in which they were performed; but, although the city kept silence as to some facts which I have no doubt would have been communicated if attention had been directed to them, I find no evidence of fraudulent concealment, or of the suppression of any fact which the city was bound to communicate. Davies v. London and Provincial Marine Insurance Co.[8].\nThere is one other clause in the agreement upon which the appellant relies. It is provided that if the city shall fail to notify the company\nof the discovery of any writ of attachment, execution issued, or judgment obtained against the salary or property of the employee, as soon as it shall have come to the knowledge of the employer, * * * this agreement shall be void and of no effect from the beginning, and all premiums paid thereon shall be forfeited to the company.\nIt is admitted that a judgment was entered on 4th February, 1922, at the suit of Colin C. Tyrer & Co., Ltd., against the Eureka Lumber Company, Ltd., Robt. Theakston and Arthur C. Theakston for $42,373.28. Evidently the Robert Theakston here mentioned was the collector. Mr. Foster, the city auditor, called by the appellant, gave this evidence:\nQ. There was a judgment entered by Mr. Tyrer against Robert Theakston and others on February 4, 1922; when did you first know about that judgment?\u2014A. Within a month or so we will say probably that is as near as I can come to it; in the course of business I heard of it.\nQ. You knew about the judgment?\u2014A. I knew about the judgment; the circumstances was told to me,\nQ. Within a month or so?\u2014A. Yes. Mr. Murphy, the mayor, who was called for the plaintiff, gave the following evidence in his cross-examination:\nQ. When did you know that there was a judgment entered against Theakston and others for a large amount?\u2014A. That did not come to my knowledge I doubt very much until after the break and it then did not come to me in the form of any acknowledgment of a judgment, but my recollection in (sic) a statement to the effect that Theakston had paid some money, if I recollect perhaps $20,000 to adjust some old judgment, but the information as to the judgment itself I had not heard of at the time.\nQ. This judgment was entered in February, 1922; did not Mr. Foster the auditor tell you about it?\u2014A. No sir, he never exchanged a word with me respecting it.\nAnd, upon this groundwork, the contention is raised that the agreement became void under the clause quoted. I am not satisfied however that the city can be held to have discovered the judgment merely because the city auditor in the course of business heard of it; in any case, it does not appear to have been a judgment obtained against the salary or property of the employee, and is therefore not of the description specified in the agreement.\nIn the conclusion, I am in agreement with the learned trial judge, and I think the case should be disposed of upon the principle affirmed by Lord Brougham in the House of Lords in MacTaggart v. Watson[9], an authority which, as said by the Divisional Court in Durham v. Fowler[10], had been regarded as the leading authority for years. Lord Brougham said, in addressing the house:\nThe error, however, in the present case arises in supposing that any want of care on the commissioners\u2019 side, in making the trustee do that which the surety had covenanted that he should do, was like a postponement of the surety\u2019s equities, or diminution of his rights at law.\nHowever, we need not discuss such questions in this case, nor deal with the English decision in Mountague v. Tidcombe[11], which was that of a positive and express covenant given to the surety by the obligee. Neither are we called upon to dispute the doctrine of the court below, laid down here, and in Mein v. Hardie[12], that where any one gives security for the conduct of another, in a certain office which brings him in contact with persons also in the office, he has a right to expect that these persons will, in all things affecting the surety, conduct themselves according, to law and discharge their duties. All this may be generally true, and yet it cannot avail to discharge a surety who has expressly bound himself for a person\u2019s doing certain things, unless it can be shown that the party taking the security has, by his conduct, either prevented the things from being done, or connived at their omission, or enabled the person to do what he ought not to have done, or leave undone what he ought to have done, and that but for such conduct the omission or commission would not have happened. The present is not such a case; the facts are not here to govern any such conclusion.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAnglin C.J.C. (dissenting).\u2014The material facts are sufficiently stated in the opinion of my brother Newcombe, which I have had the advantage of reading. While I agree with his disposition of most of the points raised by the appellant, there is one matter on which I find myself unable to accept my learned brother\u2019s view\u2014and that is so fundamental that the contrary opinion which I entertain upon it leads to the conclusion that this appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nIt is quite certain that no part of the moneys received from the three cheques mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s particulars, aggregating $13,445.23, was embezzled or stolen by the city collector Theakston, or was lost to the city of Halifax. Every cent of the proceeds of those three cheques went to the city\u2019s credit in its bank account. That fact would suffice to dispose of the plaintiff\u2019s case upon the record as it stands before us, because the embezzlement and loss alleged is in respect of the proceeds of these three cheques.\nI agree, however, with my brother Newcombe that the particulars should, if necessary, be amended so as to make them broad enough to cover the defalcations pointed to in the solicitor\u2019s letter of the 1st of August to the appellant company, which states the nature of the city\u2019s claim. So amended, the claim may be regarded as based upon the defalcations, embezzlements or thefts in an effort to conceal which the collector\u2019s books were falsified in regard to the proceeds of the three cheques specified in the particulars.\nBy more or less adroit manipulation in the collector\u2019s book-keeping, the proceeds of these cheques (except $1,833.69 credited to Mr, Brister) were credited to other taxpayers whose cheques had already been similarly dealt with, or (perhaps) whose cash payments the collector had appropriated to his own use, i.e., embezzled or stolen. It may well be that evidence or proof of the embezzlements or thefts was available to the city only when the three cheques were so dealt with in Theakston\u2019s books, but the actual embezzlements or thefts, which the false entries in his books were designed to cover up, may have occurred at some earlier date or dates. Nothing definite as to this is shewn. I am, with respect, unable to accept the view that the actual embezzlements or thefts should prima facie be taken to have occurred when the falsification of the books took place in respect of the three cheques, or that the proof of such falsification cast any burden on the defendant company to show that the actual embezzlements or thefts had occurred at some earlier date or dates. The plaintiff was required to establish loss to it by embezzlement or theft within the terms of the defendant\u2019s guarantee.\nOne of the stipulations of the bond sued on is that\nno more than one claim, and that only in respect of acts of embezzlement or theft of money committed within twelve months prior to the receipt by the company of the notice of discovery thereof, to be given as is hereinafter provided, shall be made under this agreement * * *\nThe required notice was given to the company of the embezzlements or thefts in a letter from the mayor of the 2nd of June, 1923. To come within the guarantee the embezzlements or thefts claimed for must be shewn to have taken place not earlier than the 2nd of June, 1922. Assuming the particulars to be amended as already indicated, there is no evidence in the record to show at what time or times the moneys, the theft or embezzlement of which by Theakston the manipulation of his book-keeping entries in regard to the three cheques was meant to cover up, were actually misappropriated or stolen. Nothing appears which is inconsistent with the idea that the moneys had all been stolen or embezzled prior to the 2nd of June, 1922. It is that the embezzlement or theft shall have been committed within 12 months prior to the notice of discovery thereof, and not that the doing or omission of some act shall have made possible the proof thereof, that the condition of the bond requires. Without evidence warranting a finding that the moneys in question were stolen after the 2nd of June, 1922, the plaintiff, in my opinion, does not bring its loss within the terms of the defendant company\u2019s guarantee and, therefore, cannot recover in this action.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L.

Act, 1867, s. 92 (2)\nThe British Columbia Fuel-oil Tax Act, 1923, c. 71, which imposes a certain tax per gallon on purchasers of fuel oil and defines \"purchaser\" as meaning \"any person who within the province purchases fuel oil when sold for the first time after its manufacture in or importation into the province\", is ultra vires.

W. de B. Farris K.C. for the appellant.\nE. P. Davis K.C. and J. E. McMullen for the respondent. The judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014This action is brought by the Attorney General for British Columbia, on behalf of His Majesty the King, for the recovery of taxes on fuel oil from the defendant as \"first purchaser\" and also as holder thereof for consumption. To the claim made upon it as first purchaser the defendant offers two defences: (a) that it is not in fact \"first purchaser\" of the oil; (b) that the provincial legislation imposing the taxation is ultra vires.\nIt is perhaps difficult, on the evidence in the record, to say that the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. was the \"first purchaser\" of the fuel oil for which it is sought to collect the taxes; but that it was may, for present purposes, be assumed against it. That the railway company bought and held the fuel oil for consumption in its own operations and not for re\u2014sale seems, however, to be abundantly clear.\nThe material provisions of the British Columbia Fuel-oil Tax Act, 1923, c. 71, read as follows:\n2. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires:\u2014\n***\n\"Purchaser\" means any person who within the province purchases Fuel-oil when sold for the first time after its manufacture in or importation into the province:\n***\n3. Every purchaser shall pay to His Majesty for the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes a tax equal to one-half cent per gallon of all Fuel-oil purchased by him, which tax shall be levied and collected in the manner provided in this Act.\n4. Every vendor at the time of the sale of any Fuel-oil shall levy and collect the tax imposed by this Act in respect of the Fuel-oil and shall on or before the fifteenth day of the month next following that in which the sale takes place pay over to the collector of the assessment district in which the sale takes place the full amount of the tax.\n5. Every vendor shall, with each monthly payment, furnish to the collector a return showing all sales of Fuel-oil made by him to purchasers during the preceding month, which return shall be in the form and verified in the manner prescribed by the regulations.\n6. (1) Subject to subsection (3) after the expiration of one month from the commencement of this Act, every person who keeps or has in his possession or under his control for use or consumption by himself, his family, agent, or employee, or in any business or occupation in which he is interested or employed, any Fuel-oil respecting which no tax has been paid under this Act shall, prior to the use or consumption of the Fuel-oil, or any part thereof, pay to His Majesty for the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes a tax equal to one-half cent per gallon of the Fuel-oil.\n(2) Subject to subsection (3), after the expiration of one month from the commencement of this Act, no person shall use or consume any Fuel-oil unless a tax has been paid in respect thereof under this Act.\n(3) No tax shall be payable under this section in respect of Fuel-oil imported into the province for use in and which is used in the operation of vessels plying between ports in the province and ports outside of the dominion.\n(4) Every person who uses or consumes any Fuel-oil in violation of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of an offence against this Act.\n(5) In any prosecution for failure to pay the tax imposed by this section, the burden of proving that a tax has been paid in respect of the Fuel-oil used or consumed shall be upon the defendant.\nHad section 6 been the only provision imposing the tax it would probably be difficult for the respondent to maintain its inapplicability to the Fuel-oil in its possession from time to time, or successfully to challenge its validity. But it was common ground at bar that s. 6 assumes the validity of s. 3 and was meant to be operative only if the Fuel-oil in respect of which it is sought to collect the tax was subject to taxation, under s. 3, in the hands of the \"first purchaser\"; and we are, in effect, asked to dispose of the appeal before us on that assumption and on the footing that its outcome should be dependent upon our view as to the validity or invalidity of s. 3. We accede to this request.\nOne ground of objection to the validity of s. 3 pressed at bar is that this section imposes an excise tax and that its enactment by the provincial legislature therefore contravenes s. 122 of the B.N.A. Act and s. 7 of the Terms of Union of British Columbia with Canada. This objection, however, involves considerations so far-reaching in their application and effect that they should be approached only in the event of the failure of the other ground of attack on s. 3, namely, that the tax which it imposes is not a direct tax within s. 92 (2) of the B.N.A. Act.\nIt may be that under some circumstances it would be a proper inference that in its common incidence, and under the normal operation in ordinary cases of its general tendency, such a tax as that imposed by s. 3 would in reality be borne by the very persons who are required to pay it and that it would, therefore, be proper to ascribe to the legislature the intention that its incidence should be so confined. But, apart from such special circumstances, the presumable incidence and the general tendency of a tax imposed on the \"first purchaser\" in a province of a commodity susceptible of general use is that it will be passed on to the consumer, who may or may not\u2014and in ordinary cases will not\u2014be its \"first purchaser\" who is required by s. 3 to pay the tax. The evidence in our opinion falls short of disclosing such special circumstances as might suffice to take this tax out of the category of taxes imposed on marketable commodities, such as customs and excise duties, which, according to their general incidence, it may be expected will ultimately be borne by persons other than those required by the taxing statute to pay them and are, therefore, indirect. It may sufficiently clearly appear that in the particular case of the respondent company all Fuel-oil purchased by it is consumed in its own operations and that none of it is re\u2014sold. But whether a provincial tax is direct or indirect, valid, or invalid, cannot depend upon its actual results in particular cases (Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[3]), or upon special events which may vary (Attorney General for Quebec v. Reed[4] ).\nThe evidence discloses that there is already a very considerable use made of Fuel-oil in British Columbia, many public and private buildings in the city of Vancouver being heated by it and public and private enterprises established in the province using it to generate power, etc. No doubt comparatively few cases of re-sale in British Columbia by purchasers from the two large vending corporations\u2014the Union Oil Co. of Canada and Imperial Oil Co., Ltd\u2014were shown at the trial. But the evidence does disclose re-sales by the Union Steamship Co.\u2014 a purchaser from the Union Oil Co. of Canada\u2014to the British Columbia Canneries when called upon to supply oil for a few isolated points along the coast. Apparently the Union Steamship Company's boats make a practice of selling Fuel-oil to persons who may require it at their points of call up and down the coast. Such persons it is said have no other source of supply. Moreover, the evidence seems to make it reasonably clear that the Imperial Oil Co. \"pur- chases\" its Fuel-oil \"in the ordinary way,\" when it can get it, from the Imperial Oil Co. refineries plant at Ioco, B.C., and, when the refineries plant cannot supply its requirements, in the open market \"from any person from whom it can buy.\"\nThere is also evidence of the prevalence in the United States of purchases and re-sales of Fuel-oil by middle-men, and that, as the use of Fuel-oil increases in British Columbia, there will be a tendency in that province towards such re-sales of this commodity becoming more prevalent. It cannot in our opinion be said that a case has been made out of such special circumstances existing in regard to the fuel oil business in British Columbia as would justify the courts in considering that, notwithstanding \"the normal effect and tendency of (a) tax\" on such a marketable commodity, the tax imposed by s. 3 is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it\u2014\"who are ultimately to bear the burden of it.\" That this is the test of a direct tax within s. 92 (2) of the B.N.A. Act does not now admit of question: Attorney General for Manitoba v. Attorney General for Canada[5]. In the absence of proof of special circumstances establishing that, unless in very exceptional conditions, the actual normal operation of the tax on Fuel-oil, as the legislature may be assumed to know it, would not prevail, that test must determine its validity.\nNot only does the evidence fall short of establishing the existence of special circumstances which might negative an expectation on the part of the legislature that the tax paid under s. 3 would be passed on, but it rather lends support to the view implied in its imposition on the \"first purchaser\" that there will, or at least may, be subsequent purchasers on whom the burden of it would according to normal tendencies actually fall.\nWe are of the opinion that the judgment a quo should be affirmed.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal arises out of an action brought by appellant to recover from the respondent taxes imposed by virtue of the Fuel-oil Tax Act enacted by the legislature of British Columbia in 1923, being c. 71. Section 6, subsection 1, thereof, is as follows:\n6. (1) Subject to subsection (3), every person who keeps or has in his possession or under his control for use or consumption by himself, his family, agent, or employee, or in any business or occupation in which he is interested or employee, any Fuel-oil respecting which no tax has been paid under this Act shall, prior to the use or consumption of the Fuel-oil, or any part thereof, pay to His Majesty for the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes a tax equal to one-half cent per gallon of the Fuel-oil.\nThat shews clearly upon what class of purchasing thereof it is intended to impose the tax.\nSubsections (2), (3), (4) and (5), which read as follows:\n(2) Subject to subsection (3), no person shall use or consume any Fuel-oil unless a tax has been paid in respect thereof under this Act.\n(3) No tax shall be payable under this section in respect of Fuel-oil imported into the province for use in and which is used in the operation of vessels plying between ports in the province and ports outside of the dominion.\n(4) Every person who uses or consumes any Fuel-oil in violation of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of an offence against this Act.\n(5) In any prosecution for failure to pay the tax imposed by this section, the burden of proving that a tax has been paid in respect of the Fuel-oil used or consumed shall be upon the defendant.\nmake it, if possible, more abundantly clear that it is only Fuel-oil intended for use or consumption in that part of British Columbia which is not travellable upon by vessels adapted to sailing outside thereof, and that it is only such other purchasers thereof as intended to so use the Fuel-oil for consumption that are liable to pay the tax.\nThe reason for exempting the users of Fuel-oil mentioned in said subsection (3), is, I apprehend, to avoid any possible conflict with, or overstepping the limitations of the powers of a province to extend any taxation beyond its own boundaries.\nThere is, I submit, not a shadow of doubt but that the claim herein is against the respondent company for the tax imposed herein upon what it used within the province.\nThe purview of the entire Act is, I submit, quite clear that its operation is to be confined within the province, and to Fuel-oil bought with the intention of using it therein for fuel.\nIt is, I submit, conclusively proven that it is only an occasional, accidental sale, as it were, that is made to anyone else than a large consumer, or by anyone outside the control of one or other of the two separate sets of business concerns each consisting of two or more separate legal entities co-operating to produce and sell fuel-oil to consumers thereof and both sets directly or indirectly involved in this litigation.\nIt is alleged that substantially the same situation had existed for thirteen years before the passing of the Act, although an increased amount of business has been produced. This increase has been proven to shew that there may be hereafter a different situation created and a change brought about that would render the tax in question an indirect, instead of a direct tax.\nI submit there is no basis for such fears. Indeed I strongly suspect they are conjured up to try by some means to frighten the courts into such a conclusion.\nThe chief asset the respondent has in support of that contention is the peculiar frame of the Act in question, which begins with an interpretive clause that gives to the words \" purchaser \" and \" vendor \" respectively, the following meanings:\u2014\n\"Purchaser\" means any person who within the province purchases fuel-oil when sold for the first time after its manufacture in or importation into the province.\n\"Vendor\" means any person who within the province sells fuel-oil for the first time after its manufacture in or importation into the province.\nThat is followed by three sections which can be read' with the effect of dominating the whole of the rest of the Act. Doing so would so obliterate the clear meaning of the rest of the Act as to come sadly in conflict with that due consideration of the entire purview of the Act, which, in such cases, it is, I respectfully submit, our duty to appreciate and observe in reaching our conclusion.\nThe \"first purchaser\" referred to above and in question, is to my mind, the above party respondent, as three of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal below find.\nThe facts upon which Mr. Justice MacDonald relies in his reasons for so maintaining, I agree with. And furthermore I cannot see how the California company and the Canadian subsidiary thereof can be, though in a corporate sense separate legal entities, properly held1, in light of the whole evidence, other than one and the same party operating together; solely directed from California, and the Canadian entity not the first purchaser, but the vendor, on behalf of its parent company to respondent.\nIf the appellant had brought the action against the said Canadian subsidiary, I submit he would have hopelessly failed to prove his case.\nAs to the other question raised of the said tax being an indirect tax, I cannot agree. It is to my mind clearly a direct tax, if read, as I have pointed out above, it should be.\nThe decisions referred to by counsel for respondent here, where not familiarly known to me long ago, I have read.\nThe weight of authority is surely against the respondent if the Act is interpreted and construed as I have done above.\nThe argument drawn from and founded upon section 122 of the B.N.A. Act by counsel for the 'respondent, I respectfully submit, is quite untenable.\nThe said section was simply needed temporarily for use at the crossing of each province, from being an independent province to forming part of the new dominion. And the British Columbia provision the counsel refer to is of same nature.\nThe attempt to form an argument on the word \" excise \" therein seems to me answered by the decision of the Privy Council in the Brewers & Malsters Association of Ontario ? v. The Attorney General of Ontario[6], and many other cases since.\nI agree in the main with the respective reasonings of Mr. Justice Martin and Mr. Justice McPhillips in the court appealed from, dealing with leading authorities and the results they reach, and hence find no necessity for repeating same herein.\nI should, therefore, allow this appeal with costs throughout, and reverse the judgments of the learned trial judge and the court appealed from.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Farris, Farris, Stultz & Sloan.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

Lafleur K.C. and Alph. D\u00e9cary K.C. for the appellant.\nG. A. Marsan K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014Le 14 juillet 1911, Michel Desjardins vendit \u00e0 L\u00e9on Laframboise, l\u2019appelant, avec garantie l\u00e9gale et libre de toutes dettes et hypoth\u00e8ques g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques, le lot de terre connu sous le num\u00e9ro 1157 du cadastre de la paroisse de Montr\u00e9al; et son \u00e9pouse, l\u2019intim\u00e9e, agissant avec son autorisation, intervint \u00e0 l\u2019acte de vente o\u00f9 elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9\nqu\u2019elle renonce sp\u00e9cialement \u00e0 tous droits qu\u2019elle a sur ledit immeuble, y compris ceux pouvant lui r\u00e9sulter de son contrat de mariage avec le vendeur pass\u00e9 devant Z. N. Raymond, N.P., le vingt-deux novembre mil neuf cent sept et enregistr\u00e9, etc.\nPlus de treize ans apr\u00e8s, le 23 septembre 1924, l\u2019\u00e9pouse du vendeur institua une action contre son mari et l\u2019acheteur concluant\n\u00e0 ce que le susdit acte de vente ainsi fait et pass\u00e9 entre les d\u00e9fendeurs soit r\u00e9sili\u00e9, annul\u00e9 et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul et de nul effet \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit; \u00e0 ce que la radiation et l\u2019annulation de l\u2019enregistrement du susdit acte de vente soient en cons\u00e9quence ordonn\u00e9es.\nDans la d\u00e9claration o\u00f9 elle prend les conclusions qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, elle commence par invoquer certaines clauses de son contrat de mariage; et, comme il est essentiel d\u2019avoir sous les yeux le texte de ces stipulations, il vaut autant les reproduire ici, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but, en nous limitant, pour le moment, \u00e0 celles que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a cit\u00e9es:\u2014\nArticle 1er. Il y aura s\u00e9paration de biens entre les futurs \u00e9poux et ils ne seront pas tenus des dettes Fun de l\u2019autre, cr\u00e9\u00e9es avant ou pendant leur mariage.\nArticle 2\u00e8me.

Les d\u00e9penses du mariage seront \u00e0 la charge du futur \u00e9poux.\nArticle 4\u00e8me. En consid\u00e9ration dudit mariage, le futur \u00e9poux fait donation entrevifs et irr\u00e9vocable \u00e0 la future \u00e9pouse, ce acceptant, \u00e0 savoir:\n1. D\u2019une somme de mil huit cents piastres ($1,800), qui sera payable \u00e0 la future \u00e9pouse, ses hoirs et ayants cause, \u00e0 m\u00eame les plus clairs et apparents biens de la succession du futur \u00e9poux, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ce dernier. Le futur \u00e9poux devra cependant en payer l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat annuel au taux de trois pour cent, \u00e0 la future \u00e9pouse; et ce jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la future \u00e9pouse ait retir\u00e9 le capital d\u00e9 ladite donation tel que ci-lessus pr\u00e9vu;\n2. Au d\u00e9c\u00e8s du futur \u00e9poux, la future \u00e9pouse aura la jouissance et usufruit sa vie durant en par elle gardant viduit\u00e9, d\u2019un emplacement situ\u00e9 dans la cit\u00e9 de Saint-Henri, sur la rue Agn\u00e8s, connu et d\u00e9sign\u00e9 sous le n\u00b0 1157, aux plan et livre de renvoi officiels de la paroisse de Montr\u00e9al et contenant quarante pieds de largeur par quatre-vingt-douze pieds de profondeur,\n[Page 195\nmesure anglaise, avec une maison et autres b\u00e2tisses dessus construites, ainsi que la jouissance et usufruit sa vie durant, en par elle gardant viduit\u00e9, de tous les meubles meublants, couvertures de lits, lingeries, ustensiles de cuisine, etc., en un mot de tout ce qui garnira la susdite maison, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s du futur \u00e9poux. Le futur \u00e9poux exemptant la future \u00e9pouse de faire inventaire et de donner caution.\n3. Le futur \u00e9poux s\u2019engage \u00e0 recevoir \u00e0 sa demeure et \u00e0 sa table les enfants actuels de la future \u00e9pouse, quand cette derni\u00e8re manifestera le d\u00e9sir d\u2019avoir avec elle sesdits enfants.\nEn consid\u00e9ration des susdites donations et avantages, la future \u00e9pouse renonce pour elle et ses enfants \u00e0 tout douaire.\nApr\u00e8s avoir ainsi r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 son contrat de mariage, l\u2019intim\u00e9e, dans sa d\u00e9claration, relata l\u2019acte de vente du 14 juillet 1911 entre son mari et l\u2019appelant et exposa d\u2019abord comme suit la raison pour laquelle elle conclut \u00e0 la r\u00e9siliation de cet acte de vente:\u2014\n6. Cette vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en fraude des droits de la demanderesse et est ill\u00e9gale, frauduleuse et doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9e.\nL\u2019appelant fit motion pour qu\u2019il fut ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de d\u00e9clarer\nen, quoi et pourquoi cette vente \u00e9tait faite en fraude de ses droits et \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale et frauduleuse\net pourquoi elle devait \u00eatre annul\u00e9e. Cette motion fut accord\u00e9e, et un ordre de la cour intervint en cons\u00e9quence. L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019y conforma en modifiant le paragraphe 6 de sa d\u00e9claration qui, d\u00e8s lors, se lut ainsi:\u2014\n6. Cette vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en fraude des droits de la demanderesse et est ill\u00e9gale, frauduleuse et doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9e parce que la demanderesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9e \u00e0 signer ledit acte sous le coup de l\u2019erreur, et par suite du dol et des fausses repr\u00e9sentations des d\u00e9fendeurs qui lui repr\u00e9sent\u00e8rent l\u00e0 et alors qu\u2019en signant ledit acte de vente elle n\u2019en \u00e9prouverait aucun pr\u00e9judice, mais qu\u2019au contraire cet acte avait pour effet de prot\u00e9ger ses droits et avantages matrimoniaux.\nLesdits d\u00e9fendeurs profitant, dans les circonstances, du mauvais \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de la demanderesse pour l\u2019inciter \u00e0 signer l\u2019acte de vente du 14 juillet 1911 qui la d\u00e9pouillait de la seule garantie de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses avantages matrimoniaux, ce dont la demanderesse n\u2019\u00e9tait pas alors en \u00e9tat de se rendre compte \u00e0 cause de l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u00e9labr\u00e9 de sant\u00e9 qui l\u2019a maintenue dans une grande faiblesse, sant\u00e9 qui depuis lors ne s\u2019est pas am\u00e9lior\u00e9e.\nCe paragraphe constitue l\u2019unique motif all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour justifier les conclusions de son action.\nOn \u00e9tait donc en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une demande, par voie d\u2019action directe, de l\u2019annulation d\u2019une acte re\u00e7u devant notaire pour cause d\u2019erreur de la part de la partie qui se plaint et de dol ou fraude de la part de l\u2019autre partie.\nLe proc\u00e8s-verbal des proc\u00e9dures faites \u00e0 l\u2019audience relate que \u201cla demanderesse d\u00e9clara ne pas avoir de preuve \u00e0 faire\u201d. L\u2019appelant offrit son t\u00e9moignage pour \u00e9tablir certains faits qui s\u2019\u00e9taient pass\u00e9s lors de la r\u00e9ception de l\u2019acte par le notaire. Ce t\u00e9moignage fut donn\u00e9 sous r\u00e9serve des objections de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Le proc\u00e8s-verbal \u00e9tablit que l\u2019enqu\u00eate fut ensuite d\u00e9clar\u00e9e close et que la cause fut prise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure annula dans son entier l\u2019acte de vente entre Laframboise et Desjardins. Le jugement s\u2019appuie sur les articles 1265 et 1301 du code civil et quelques arr\u00eats que nous aurons \u00e0 examiner par la suite. Il est motiv\u00e9 comme suit:\u2014\nConsidering that the renunciation by a wife of a mortgage granted by her husband in the marriage contract, to assure the payment of a sum of money and other advantages, is a derogation of their marriage covenants, prohibited by law; and is void and of no effect, especially as under the circumstances of this case, both the defendants knew that the husband of the plaintiff benefitted by the said renunciation.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi fut d\u2019avis que la renonciation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e aux droits et avantages qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par son contrat de mariage n\u2019affectait en aucune fa\u00e7on la validit\u00e9 de la vente entre le vendeur et l\u2019acheteur. En cons\u00e9quence, le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure fut infirm\u00e9 et la vente fut maintenue. La cour ne vit, non plus, dans la renonciation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e aucune infraction \u00e0 l\u2019article 1301 C.C.; mais elle consid\u00e9ra toutefois que cette renonciation \u00e9tait contraire aux dispositions de l\u2019article 1265 C.C.\nLa cour se demanda cependant si, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019intim\u00e9e (qui avait pris l\u2019initiative de demander \u00e0 la cour la r\u00e9siliation de l\u2019acte en all\u00e9guant uniquement que le consentement qu\u2019elle y avait donn\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vici\u00e9 par une erreur de sa part et par les fausses repr\u00e9sentations, le dol et la fraude de la part des d\u00e9fendeurs) pouvait r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 faire maintenir son action pour une . autre cause que celle qu\u2019elle avait all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\nM. le juge Tellier \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que non. Suivant lui, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible\nde donner au jugement une autre base que celle sur laquelle reposait l\u2019action. Une telle action ne peut \u00eatre maintenue que s\u2019il y a preuve d\u2019erreur, de dol ou de fraude.\nUne action est comme un syllogisme et l\u2019on ne peut arriver\n\u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019en \u00e9tablissant les pr\u00e9misses.\nSi les pr\u00e9misses manquent, le demandeur n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 ses conclusions.\nPermettre ainsi de substituer d\u2019autres pr\u00e9misses \u00e0 celles qui servaient de fondement \u00e0 la demande, c\u2019est \u201couvrir la porte \u00e0 toutes sortes de surprises et d\u2019abus.\u201d Il aurait donc fait droit \u00e0 l\u2019appel, et il aurait rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action.\nMais la majorit\u00e9 de la cour opina dans le sens contraire. Voici les raisons qu\u2019en donne M. le juge Allard:\u2014\nLes conclusions qu\u2019elle (l\u2019intim\u00e9e) a prises demandant la nullit\u00e9 dudit acte de vente comportent certainement des conclusions \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la renonciation qu\u2019elle a faite \u00e0 sesdits droits soit annul\u00e9e. Le plus comporte le moins. De sorte que, dans mon opinion, l\u2019action de la demanderesse, si elle est (fond\u00e9e en droit, peut \u00eatre maintenue quant \u00e0 ce qui a rapport \u00e0 la renonciation de ses droits.\nCe raisonnement nous para\u00eet juste, mais il ne r\u00e9pond pas \u00e0 l\u2019objection soulev\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant, et adopt\u00e9e par M. le juge Tellier. On pouvait dire, en effet, qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait plus d\u2019all\u00e9gations pour justifier les conclusions; qu\u2019il ne suffit pas de conclure: il faut all\u00e9guer; et que l\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant des articles 1265 et 1301 C.C. n\u2019\u00e9tait pas seulement un moyen nouveau, c\u2019\u00e9tait une demande nouvelle.\nCette objection, nous l\u2019avouons, nous para\u00eet avoir beaucoup de force et aurait m\u00e9rit\u00e9 la plus s\u00e9rieuse consid\u00e9ration; mais nous croyons qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu de la discuter, \u00e0 cause de notre fa\u00e7on de voir sur la question principale de l\u2019appel qu\u2019il nous reste \u00e0 examiner.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi n\u2019a vu dans l\u2019intervention de l\u2019intim\u00e9e aucune violation de l\u2019article 1301 du code civil. L\u2019on est d\u2019accord, en effet, pour interpr\u00e9ter cet article comme une prohibition \u00e0 l\u00e0 femme mari\u00e9e de cautionner, de garantir, de s\u2019engager pour l\u2019avenir \u201cavec ou pour son mari\u201d; et il est admis que l\u2019acte juridique ainsi proscrit par le l\u00e9gislateur est le contrat de garantie ou de s\u00fbret\u00e9. Le mot \u201cs\u2019obliger\u201d, dans cet article, doit s\u2019entendre comme indiquant seulement le contrat de cautionnement. (Lebel v. Bradin; Cour du Banc du Roi[2]. C\u2019est l\u00e0 l\u2019esprit du droit romain et c\u2019est le sens de l\u2019ancien droit auquel les codificateurs n\u2019ont pas entendu innover. On ne veut pas que la femme mari\u00e9e puisse engager ses biens; mais elle conserve le droit de les ali\u00e9ner. La raison de cette distinction, qui peut para\u00eetre subtile, est donn\u00e9e par Pothier, \u00e0 la suite de Ulpien: c\u2019est qu\u2019il est plus facile d\u2019obtenir de la femme une promesse qu\u2019une donation. Nous sommes d\u2019accord sur ce point avec la Cour du Banc du Roi: il n\u2019y a pas eu, dans la renonciation dont il s\u2019agit, un acte par lequel l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est oblig\u00e9e avec ou pour son mari. L\u2019article 1301 C.C. n\u2019a donc pas d\u2019application.\nMais la renonciation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est-elle contraire aux dispositions de l\u2019article 1265 C.C.? Il se lit comme suit:\u2014\n1265. Apr\u00e8s le mariage, il ne peut \u00eatre fait aux conventions matrimoniales contenues au contrat, aucun changement pas m\u00eame par don mutuel d\u2019usufruit, lequel est aboli.\nLes \u00e9poux ne peuvent non plus s\u2019avantager entrevifs si ce n\u2019est conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la loi qui permettent au mari, sous certaines restrictions et conditions, d\u2019assurer sa vie pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de sa femme et de ses enfants.\nPar le contrat de mariage, dont une partie \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le futur \u00e9poux a fait donation, 1\u00b0 d\u2019une somme de mille huit cents piastres ($1,800); 2\u00b0 de la jouissance et usufruit de l\u2019emplacement situ\u00e9 dans la cit\u00e9 de Saint-Henri et portant le num\u00e9ro 1157 du cadastre de la paroisse de Montr\u00e9al.\nC\u2019est l\u2019emplacement qui a fait l\u2019objet de l\u2019acte de vente entre le mari et l\u2019appelant.\nEn consid\u00e9ration de ces donations et avantages, la future \u00e9pouse a renonc\u00e9, pour elle et ses enfants, \u00e0 tout douaire. En outre, par une clause \u00e9galement contenue au contrat de mariage, mais que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas invoqu\u00e9e dans sa d\u00e9claration (ce qui souligne davantage le fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention d\u2019all\u00e9guer la violation de l\u2019article 1265 C.C.), l\u2019emplacement portant le num\u00e9ro 1157 du cadastre de la paroisse de Montr\u00e9al est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 affect\u00e9 et hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9\npour garantir la fid\u00e8le ex\u00e9cution des susdites charges et obligations par le futur \u00e9poux.\nAu moyen de son intervention dans la vente \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e\nrenonce sp\u00e9cialement \u00e0 tous droits qu\u2019elle a sur ledit immeuble, y compris ceux pouvant lui r\u00e9sulter d\u00e9 son contrat de mariage avec le vendeur (son mari).\nSa renonciation, il est important de le noter, se borne donc aux droits qu\u2019elle a sur l\u2019immeuble. Elle n\u2019abandonne rien \u00e0 son mari. Elle renonce seulement en faveur d\u2019un tiers. La donation de la jouissance et usufruit de l\u2019emplacement connu sous le num\u00e9ro 1157 est une donation \u00e0 cause de mort. L\u2019acte dit:\u2014\nAu d\u00e9c\u00e8s du futur \u00e9poux, la future \u00e9pouse aura la jouissance et usufruit sa vie durant en par elle gardant viduit\u00e9, d\u2019un emplacement, etc.\nIl n\u2019y a pas de d\u00e9saisissement actuel. C\u2019est un gain de survie. La future \u00e9pouse n\u2019en sera saisie qu\u2019advenant la mort de son mari avant la sienne. (XV Laurent, n\u00b0 309). Les donations \u00e0 cause de mort ou les donations de biens \u00e0 venir sont permises dans les contrats de mariage. Elles peuvent \u00eatre faites par les parents, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et m\u00eame par les \u00e9trangers. Les futurs \u00e9poux peuvent \u00e9galement, par leur contrat de mariage, se faire respectivement de pareilles donations; et ces derni\u00e8res sont sujettes aux m\u00eames r\u00e8gles que celles qui sont faites par les parents ou par des \u00e9trangers (art. 819 C.C.).\nMais il y a cette distinction \u00e0 faire entre la donation ordinaire de biens pr\u00e9sents par contrat de mariage et la donation \u00e0 cause de mort que la premi\u00e8re ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e\nsi ce n\u2019est pour cause de droit ou par suite d\u2019une condition r\u00e9solutoire validement stipul\u00e9e;\ntandis que la seconde, tout en d\u00e9fendant au donateur de disposer des biens donn\u00e9s par donation entrevifs ou par testament\nsi ce n\u2019est pour sommes modiques, \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9compense ou autrement,\nle laisse\nlibre d\u2019ali\u00e9ner \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux et pour son propre avantage les biens ainsi donn\u00e9s (art. 823 C.C.)\nIl va de soi qu\u2019il n\u2019appartient pas aux parties, par la qualification qu\u2019elles lui auraient donn\u00e9e, de modifier le caract\u00e8re de leur donation (20 Demolombe, n\u00b0 405; Robitaille v. Lemieux[3] (Cour Sup\u00e9rieure). Ce n\u2019est donc pas parce que le contrat de mariage dont nous nous occupons aurait attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la donation d\u2019usufruit dont il s\u2019agit la fausse appellation de \u201cdonation entrevifs\u201d que le caract\u00e8re de cette donation serait pour cela chang\u00e9.\nUne donation de biens d\u00e9termin\u00e9s n\u2019emp\u00eache pas qu\u2019elle soit faite \u00e0 cause de mort. Elle peut comprendre les biens que le donateur laissera \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, l\u2019universalit\u00e9 ou une partie de ces biens, mais elle peut \u00eatre \u00e9galement de\nbiens particuliers individuellement d\u00e9sign\u00e9s, des corps certains ou des quantit\u00e9s, comme, par exemple, tels chevaux, telle maison, etc.\n23 Demolombe, n\u00b0 279; 15 Laurent, n\u00b0 193. Laurent exprime m\u00eame l\u2019avis (vol. 15, n\u00b0 309) qu\u2019entre \u00e9poux on pourrait plut\u00f4t poser la r\u00e8gle qu\u2019ils sont cens\u00e9s avoir voulu faire une donation de biens \u00e0 venir;\nils n\u2019ont pas de raison de se faire une donation actuelle puisque r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement ils jouissent en commun de leurs biens. Dans la donation \u00e0 cause de mort, le donataire n\u2019a aucun droit actuel sur les biens donn\u00e9s, pas m\u00eame un droit conditionnel. Laurent enseigne (vol. 15, n\u00b0 319) que si les cr\u00e9anciers provoquent la vente, le donataire ne peut pas s\u2019y opposer; \u00e0 la rigueur, il ne peut pas m\u00eame faire d\u2019actes conservatoires. C\u2019est \u00e9galement la doctrine de Demolombe, vol. 23, n\u00b0 323.\nL\u2019article 823 C.C. d\u00e9clare que le donataire \u00e0 cause de mort demeure propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards, sauf qu\u2019il ne peut disposer des biens donn\u00e9s \u00e0 titre gratuit.\nA ce sujet, il est int\u00e9ressant de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat de Boissy v. Daignault[4] o\u00f9, dans son contrat de mariage, la future \u00e9pouse avait donn\u00e9 au futur \u00e9poux la jouissance, sa vie durant, d\u2019une terre qui y \u00e9tait d\u00e9crite ainsi que des meubles et agr\u00e8s d\u2019agriculture qui la garnissaient et qui \u00e9taient d\u00e9sign\u00e9s dans une liste annex\u00e9e. Le tribunal, voyant dans la donation une institution contractuelle, ou donation \u00e0 cause de mort, fit application de l\u2019article 823 C.C. et annula une saisie conservatoire par laquelle l\u2019\u00e9poux donataire voulait emp\u00eacher sa femme de vendre les biens sujets \u00e0 son usufruit.\nCette interpr\u00e9tation d\u2019un article du code civil, dont les termes d\u2019ailleurs paraissent clairs, s\u2019est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, o\u00f9 il ne semble plus discut\u00e9 que la donation \u00e0 cause de mort n\u2019entrave pas la libert\u00e9 du donateur. Proulx v. Klineberg & Sheffer[5]; Dorval v. Pr\u00e9fontaine[6].\nLa donation de biens faite \u00e0 la femme par contrat de mariage comme gain de survie ne prend effet qu\u2019au d\u00e9c\u00e8s du mari. Du vivant de ce dernier, la femme n\u2019a aucun droit sur ces biens. Elle n\u2019a pas qualit\u00e9 pour former opposition \u00e0 la saisie et vente qui est faite par le cr\u00e9ancier du mari.\nQuant au donateur, il a pleine libert\u00e9 de faire des actes \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux en vendant ou en hypoth\u00e9quant. Il peut rendre la donation inefficace, car il n\u2019a conf\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019un droit de succession; et le donataire prend cette succession dans l\u2019\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elle se trouvera \u00e0 la mort du disposant (Mignault, vol. 4, p. 216). Vainement l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tendrait-elle que cette donation \u00e9tait irr\u00e9vocable. Les auteurs enseignent (9 Durant on, n\u00b0 713; 23 Demolombe, n\u00b0 314; 15 Laurent n\u00b0 215) que le donateur \u00e0 cause de mort peut vendre nonobstant toute convention contraire. Il ne pourrait m\u00eame renoncer d\u2019avance, dans le contrat de mariage, \u00e0 son droit d\u2019ali\u00e9ner \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux.\nIl en r\u00e9sulte que l\u2019intim\u00e9e en la pr\u00e9sente cause ne peut se plaindre de la vente faite par son mari \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 portant le num\u00e9ro 1157 du cadastre de la paroisse de Montr\u00e9al. L\u2019institution contractuelle ou donation \u00e0 cause de mort de la jouissance ou usufruit de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ne faisait pas obstacle \u00e0 cette vente par le mari, qui \u00e9tait demeur\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire et libre d\u2019ali\u00e9ner \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux et pour son propre avantage. L\u2019intervention de la femme sur ce point n\u2019a rien ajout\u00e9 au titre que le mari a conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant.\nCependant, par sa renonciation, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a en plus abandonn\u00e9 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que qui garantissait \u00e0 la fois son usufruit ainsi que le paiement de la somme de dix-huit cents dollars ($1,800) stipul\u00e9e au contrat de mariage.\nCette derni\u00e8re lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 est bien une donation entrevifs. Le contrat de mariage la rend payable \u00e0 la future \u00e9pouse, ses hoirs et ayants cause. L\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 le capital de la somme devra lui \u00eatre remis est fix\u00e9e \u00e0 la date du d\u00e9c\u00e8s du mari. Dans l\u2019intervalle, cependant, ce dernier doit en payer l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat annuel au taux de 3 pour 100 \u00e0 la future \u00e9pouse. Il ne s\u2019agit plus donc l\u00e0, comme dans la stipulation d\u2019usufruit, d\u2019une simple expectative de cr\u00e9ance sur les biens de la succession du donateur, mais de la donation irr\u00e9vocable d\u2019une chose pr\u00e9sente dont toutes les circonstances sont de nature \u00e0 imprimer \u00e0 l\u2019acte le caract\u00e8re d\u2019une donation actuelle. 20 Demolombe, n\u00b0 405; 7 Aubry et Rau, 4e \u00e9d., pp. 150-151.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 cette somme. Son mari est demeur\u00e9 d\u00e9biteur de l\u2019obligation personnelle. Il reste \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer si, comme l\u2019ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi, la renonciation \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que qui garantissait l\u2019usufruit et cette somme de dix-huit cents dollars ($1,800) constitue un changement aux conventions matrimoniales contenues au contrat de mariage entre les \u00e9poux, ou un avantage entrevifs contraire aux dispositions de l\u2019article 1265 C.C. Il s\u2019agit ici, bien entendu, d\u2019une renonciation en faveur d\u2019un tiers et non pas d\u2019une renonciation en faveur du mari.\nPour d\u00e9cider que la renonciation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en faveur de l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale, les jugements qui nous sont maintenant soumis se sont principalement appuy\u00e9s sur l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019Appel dans la cause de La Banque de Montr\u00e9al v. Roy[7]. Les faits \u00e9taient assez semblables \u00e0 ceux de la pr\u00e9sente cause. Le contrat de mariage stipulait s\u00e9paration de biens et renonciation au douaire. En consid\u00e9ration du mariage, il y avait donation d\u2019une somme de $2,000 \u00e0 prendre sur les plus clairs et apparents biens du futur \u00e9poux. Le contrat de mariage renfermait, en outre, la donation \u00e0 la future \u00e9pouse de la jouissance et usufruit, sa vie durant, d\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dont la d\u00e9signation \u00e9tait contenue au contrat. Enfin cette m\u00eame propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ainsi donn\u00e9e en usufruit \u00e0 la future \u00e9pouse, \u00e9tait affect\u00e9e hypoth\u00e9cairement au paiement de la somme de $2,000 qui faisait l\u2019objet de la donation, entrevifs.\nTrois ans plus tard, le mari vendit la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9e. Il d\u00e9clara ne savoir signer, en pr\u00e9sence de son \u00e9pouse qui signa avec l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur. Six mois apr\u00e8s, l\u2019\u00e9pouse renon\u00e7a, en faveur du m\u00eame acqu\u00e9reur, \u00e0 ses droits d\u2019usufruit sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en d\u00e9clarant que cette renonciation \u00e9tait faite dans le but de donner effet \u00e0 la vente ant\u00e9rieure.\nEn consid\u00e9ration de cette renonciation de la part de l\u2019\u00e9pouse et pour remplacer l\u2019usufruit auquel elle renon\u00e7ait, son mari lui c\u00e9da et abandonna la jouissance d\u2019une autre propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLe litige surgit lorsque l\u2019immeuble affect\u00e9 hypoth\u00e9cairement au paiement de la somme de $2,000 donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pouse par le contrat de mariage fut vendu en justice. Un projet de distribution fut pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par le protonotaire, o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e9pouse fut colloqu\u00e9e en vertu de cette donation. Ce projet de distribution fut contest\u00e9 par la Banque de Montr\u00e9al, \u00e0 qui le mari avait transport\u00e9 tous les droits qu\u2019il pouvait avoir sur l\u2019immeuble en question, ainsi que la balance du prix de vente qui lui \u00e9tait due par l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur. Les moyens de contestation de la Banque de Montr\u00e9al furent que la donation de la somme de $2,000 \u00e9tait une donation \u00e0 cause de mort et que le mari, en disposant \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux de Timmeuble hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9, avait, par l\u00e0, fait dispara\u00eetre la garantie donn\u00e9e; que, dans tous les cas, r\u00e9ponse avait renonc\u00e9 validement \u00e0 son hypoth\u00e8que. Il convient de noter imm\u00e9diatement que la renonciation \u00e0 l\u2019usufruit, gain de survie de l\u2019\u00e9pouse, ne fut nullement discut\u00e9e dans cette affaire.\nLe jugement de la cour fut que la donation de la somme de $2,000 \u00e9tait une donation entrevifs. Il s\u2019ensuivait que l\u2019article 823 C.C. ne pouvait pas lui \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9. Passant ensuite.\u00e0 l\u2019examen de la question subsidiaire, Sir Horace Archambault, juge-en-chef, parlant au nom de la cour, d\u00e9clare que les actes auxquels l\u2019\u00e9pouse avait particip\u00e9 ne contenaient de renonciation, ni formelle, ni pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e, \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que qui lui \u00e9tait garantie par son contrat de mariage. La pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 ces actes s\u2019expliquait autrement. Dans l\u2019acte de vente, elle \u00e9tait intervenue pour attester la marque de son mari, qui ne savait pas signer; dans l\u2019acte subs\u00e9quent, elle avait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son usufruit. Il n\u2019y avait nulle part de renonciation \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que.\nL\u2019interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e par la cour aux contrats auxquels avait particip\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9pouse mettait fin \u00e0 la contestation de la Banque de Montr\u00e9al. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait plus n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si la renonciation \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 1265 C.C., puisque la cour d\u00e9cidait qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu telle renonciation.\nSans doute, le jugement ajoute que cette renonciation, si elle avait eu lieu, n\u2019aurait eu aucune valeur en droit parce qu\u2019elle aurait constitu\u00e9 un changement aux conventions matrimoniales. Mais il reste qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de se prononcer sur cette question pour d\u00e9cider le litige. A ce titre, cette partie du jugement peut \u00eatre trait\u00e9e comme obiter dictum et n\u2019a pas la m\u00eame force et la m\u00eame autorit\u00e9 comme interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 1265 C.C. En outre, elle s\u2019appuie sur un passage de Laurent (n\u00b0 78 du vol. 21) qui est cit\u00e9 en entier. Le m\u00eame auteur, dans un article subs\u00e9quent du m\u00eame volume, att\u00e9nue la rigueur du principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qu\u2019il pose dans l\u2019article 78 cit\u00e9 par le jugement. Il convient d\u2019y r\u00e9f\u00e9rer pour mieux comprendre l\u2019ensemble de son opinion:\u2014\n83. Les \u00e9poux peuvent-ils disposer des biens qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s par contrat de mariage? On suppose que le contrat de mariage ne prohibe pas la disposition des biens dotaux dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la femme dotale. Ainsi pos\u00e9e, la question n\u2019en est r\u00e9ellement pas une; les biens donn\u00e9s entrent dans le patrimoine propre des \u00e9poux ou dans le patrimoine commun s\u2019il y a communaut\u00e9; ces biens restent dans le commerce, donc les \u00e9poux donataires en peuvent disposer sans que l\u2019on puisse dire qu\u2019il en r\u00e9sulte un changement aux conventions matrimoniales: ex\u00e9cuter ces conventions, ce n\u2019est certes pas les changer.\nLa jurisprudence est en ce sens. Des \u00e9poux se donnent par contrat de mariage l\u2019usufruit de tous leurs biens au profit du survivant. Lors du mariage de leurs enfants, la m\u00e8re renonce \u00e0 cet usufuit en faveur de son fils. Cette renonciation \u00e0 un avantage stipul\u00e9 par contrat de mariage \u00e9tait-elle un changement aux conventions matrimoniales? La cour de cassation r\u00e9pond que la renonciation est plut\u00f4t une ex\u00e9cution du contrat de mariage qu\u2019une convention qui y d\u00e9roge. Cela est tr\u00e8s juridique, quoique, au premier abord, la d\u00e9cision paraisse contraire au principe que nous avons pos\u00e9 aux renonciations (n\u00b0 78). La renonciation \u00e0 un avantage que les conjoints se font par contrat de mariage est nulle; tel est le principe admis par la doctrine et par la jurisprudence. Or, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la m\u00e8re renonce \u00e0 un usufruit stipul\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019avantage. Pourquoi la cour de cassation d\u00e9clare-t-elle cette renonciation valable? La renonciation est nulle quand elle contient l\u2019abdication d\u2019un droit; dans ce cas, elle abroge une clause du contrat de mariage, donc elle est nulle. La renonciation que la m\u00e8re fait \u00e0 son usufruit en faveur de son fils est une lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9, la m\u00e8re dispose donc de son droit; or, disposer de son droit, ce n\u2019est pas y renoncer; c\u2019est, au contraire, l\u2019exercer, et il est permis \u00e0 toute personne de disposer d\u2019un droit qui lui appartient.\nPar contrat de mariage, de futur donne \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse un domaine \u00e0 titre de gain de survie. Lors du mariage de sa fille, le p\u00e8re lui donne la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ce domaine, et la m\u00e8re renonce \u00e0 l\u2019usufruit \u00e9ventuel, contre l\u2019engagement de son mari de lui assurer une pension viag\u00e8re de 800 francs. Cette renonciation fut attaqu\u00e9e comme constituant un changement aux conventions matrimoniales. La cour d\u2019Agen d\u00e9cida que la renonciation de la femme, loin de pr\u00e9senter aucun changement \u00e0 la clause de gain de survie stipul\u00e9e dans son contrat de mariage, en \u00e9tait, au contraire, l\u2019ex\u00e9cution anticip\u00e9e. Pourvoi en cassation; la cour se borne \u00e0 dire que l\u2019arr\u00eat attaqu\u00e9 a fait une juste appr\u00e9ciation de la renonciation litigieuse. On pr\u00e9tendait que la renonciation contenait un pacte successoire; la cour r\u00e9pond que la femme n\u2019\u00e9tant pas h\u00e9riti\u00e8re de son mari, on ne pouvait pas dire qu\u2019elle e\u00fbt fait un trait\u00e9 sur sa succession future. Ici encore il y a des nuances; il y a des cas o\u00f9 la renonciation constitue un pacte successoire (n\u00b0 78); dans d\u2019autres cas, il n\u2019y a pas de pacte successoire; nous avons examin\u00e9 ailleurs ces questions difficiles.\nSi, cependant, malgr\u00e9 les r\u00e9serves que nous venons de faire, il nous fallait consid\u00e9rer l\u2019arr\u00eat re La Banque de Montr\u00e9al v. Roy[8] comme ayant l\u2019autorit\u00e9 d\u2019un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent sur la question qui nous occupe, nous ne saurions \u00e9viter la remarque qu\u2019il ne tient aucun compte de toute la jurisprudence ant\u00e9rieure, \u00e0 laquelle d\u2019ailleurs il ne fait aucune allusion. A cette \u00e9poque (1917) elle \u00e9tait cependant solidement \u00e9tablie. C\u2019\u00e9tait au point que le juge-en-chef actuel de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, M. le juge Lafontaine, qui n\u2019a pas si\u00e9g\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, disait, dans un arr\u00eat tr\u00e8s \u00e9tudi\u00e9 rendu en 1916 re Joubert et Turcotte, Allan & Company v. Kieffer[9]:\u2014\nIl ne fait plus de doute, aujourd\u2019hui, non plus, le point ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 souvent d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens par une longue suite de d\u00e9cisions qui datent des premiers temps de la loi 4 Vict., c. 30, s. 36, d\u2019o\u00f9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 (tir\u00e9 notre article 1301, comme aussi depuis le code, qu\u2019une femme peut renoncer aux droits d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que et privil\u00e8ge qu\u2019elle poss\u00e8de pour la garantie de ses cr\u00e9ances contre son mari ou de ses droits matrimoniaux, et c\u00e9der une priorit\u00e9 d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que \u00e0 un cr\u00e9ancier de son mari. Voir Boudria v. McLean (Cour du Banc de la Reine)[10]; Hamel v. Panet (Conseil Priv\u00e9)[11]; In re Hogue; Dupuis v. Cousineau (M. le juge Jett\u00e9)[12]. La m\u00eame r\u00e8gle et les m\u00eames d\u00e9cisions s\u2019appliqueraient pareillement au cas de la remise d\u2019un gage par une femme cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re, comme le dit la loi romaine et les auteurs qui l\u2019ont comment\u00e9e.\nL\u2019arr\u00eat de Boudria v. McLean10, mentionn\u00e9 par M. le juge Lafontaine, fut rendu par la Cour du Banc de la Reine le 4 mars 1862. Les appelants avaient contract\u00e9 mariage sous le r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9 par contrat re\u00e7u devant notaire. L\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait on possession d\u2019un immeuble hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 pour reprises matrimoniales de l\u2019\u00e9pouse et qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu par le mari durant l\u2019existence de la communaut\u00e9 L\u2019\u00e9pouse avait un droit d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que aussi \u00e9tendu que le conf\u00e9rait l\u2019ancien droit \u00e0 tout porteur d\u2019acte notari\u00e9. Par acte de ratification, elle avait confirm\u00e9 en tout son contenu et suivant sa formule et teneur la vente faite par son mari. Le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance affirma qu\u2019en ratifiant l\u2019acte de son mari elle avait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son hypoth\u00e8que. La majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc de la Reine d\u00e9cida que cette renonciation \u00e9tait valide.\nIl s\u2019agissait bien l\u00e0 de la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une renonciation aux droits assur\u00e9s par le contrat de mariage. Les appelants exposaient ainsi leur pr\u00e9tention:\u2014\nLa premi\u00e8re question consiste donc \u00e0 savoir si ces termes contiennent une renonciation de la part de l\u2019appelante aux droits personnels que lui assurait son contrat de mariage.\nCe jugement fut rendu avant la mise en force du code civil; mais on ne pr\u00e9tend pas que le code ait innov\u00e9 sur la loi ant\u00e9rieure. En 1871, dans la cause de Lagorgendi\u00e8re v. Thibaudeau[13], la Cour du Banc de la Reine se pronon\u00e7a de nouveau dans le m\u00eame sens. Par le contrat de mariage, les \u00e9poux avaient convenu qu\u2019ils seraient communs en biens et qu\u2019il serait loisible \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pouse d\u2019accepter la communaut\u00e9 ou d\u2019y renoncer. En cas de renonciation, elle devait reprendre franchement et quittement, tout ce qu\u2019elle pouvait avoir apport\u00e9 en mariage \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 et tout ce qui, pendant le mariage, lui \u00e9cherrait par succession, donation, legs ou autrement,\ndont elle serait garantie et indemnis\u00e9e par reprises et hypoth\u00e8ques sur tous les biens pr\u00e9sents et futurs du futur \u00e9poux.\nUn immeuble dont le mari \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire et en possession lors de la passation et de l\u2019enregistrement du contrat de mariage fut subs\u00e9quemment vendu par le sh\u00e9rif, et l\u2019\u00e9pouse fit une opposition afin de conserver ses droits fond\u00e9s sur son contrat de mariage comme cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re hypoth\u00e9caire, et en pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 tous les autres cr\u00e9anciers de son mari dont les cr\u00e9ances \u00e9taient post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement de ce contrat de mariage. On lui opposa que dans un acte notari\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur elle avait\nvolontairement renonc\u00e9 formellement et solennellement \u00e0 son douaire et \u00e0 tous droits aux douaire, avantages et r\u00e9clamations g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques, pr\u00e9sents et futurs, voulant et consentant que ladite terre sushypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9e soit d\u00e8s ce jour purg\u00e9e et d\u00e9charg\u00e9e de tous et tels douaires, hypoth\u00e8ques et autres r\u00e9clamations g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques pour et en faveur dudit sieur cr\u00e9ancier, ses hoirs et ayants cause.\nL\u2019appelant r\u00e9pondit en invoquant la nullit\u00e9 absolue de cette renonciation de sa part.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure[14] avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que rien dans la loi n\u2019emp\u00eachait la femme de renoncer \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de ses droits hypoth\u00e9caires pour reprises matrimoniales sur les biens ali\u00e9n\u00e9s par son mari. Les appelants, devant la Cour du Banc de la Reine, pos\u00e8rent la question suivante:\u2014\nA quoi bon permettre \u00e0 la femme de stipuler en son contrat de mariage, qu\u2019en cas de renonciation \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 elle reprendra franchement et quittement ce qu\u2019elle aura apport\u00e9 en mariage et ce qu\u2019elle aura re\u00e7u depuis, si on lui permet d\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de renoncer \u00e0 son hypoth\u00e8que l\u00e9gale pour ses reprises, \u00e0 la demande de son mari et pour lui?\nIls ajoutaient:\u2014\nOn permettrait ainsi \u00e0 la femme de faire indirectement ce que la loi lui d\u00e9fend de faire directement, cautionner son mari et d\u2019avantager pendant le mariage, deux choses \u00e9galement prohib\u00e9es par le code civil (art. 1265 C.C.)\nLe jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, qui avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la renonciation valide, fut confirm\u00e9.\nLes causes de Boudria v. McLean[15] et de Lagorgen-di\u00e8re v. Thibaudeau[16] furent d\u00e9battues principalement sur l\u2019effet de l\u2019article 1301 C.C. ou de la loi 4 Vict. c. 30, s. 36, d\u2019o\u00f9 cet article tire son origine; mais l\u2019on voit, par le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 que nous venons d\u2019en faire, que l\u2019on n\u2019a pas manqu\u00e9, au sujet de cette renonciation par la femme, d\u2019en envisager les cons\u00e9quences possibles \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des prohibitions contenues dans l\u2019article 1265 C.C. L\u2019on ne saurait d\u2019ailleurs supposer que ces cons\u00e9quences auraient \u00e9chapp\u00e9 \u00e0 la perspicacit\u00e9 des avocats qui ont pr\u00e9par\u00e9 ces causes, ou des tribunaux qui les ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9es; et il n\u2019est pas \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer que, dans ces deux esp\u00e8ces, les renonciations de la femme mari\u00e9e eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9es valables et l\u00e9gales si on les e\u00fbt consid\u00e9r\u00e9es susceptibles de contestation en vertu de l\u2019article 1265 C.C.\nDans la cause de Lagorgendi\u00e8re v. Thibaudeau16, il s\u2019agissait clairement d\u2019une hypoth\u00e8que consentie par le contrat de mariage. D\u2019ailleurs, l\u2019on ne s\u2019est pas m\u00e9pris sur la port\u00e9 de ces deux jugements. A la suite de celui de Boudria v. McLean15, M. le juge Smith, re Armstrong v. Rolston[17], eut \u00e0 d\u00e9cider d\u2019une opposition \u00e0 une saisie d\u2019immeubles o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e9pouse avait renonc\u00e9\n\u00e0 son douaire coutumier, avantages et r\u00e9clamations qu\u2019elle peut ou pourrait avoir par sondit mariage sur l\u2019immeuble mentionn\u00e9.\nL\u2019opposante pr\u00e9tendait qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pu en loi et n\u2019avait de fait renonc\u00e9 par cet acte\nq\u2019uau douaire coutumier qu\u2019elle avait ou pouvait avoir sur l\u2019immeuble vendu en cette cause et non \u00e0 tous avantages et r\u00e9clamations qu\u2019elle avait ou pouvait avoir lui r\u00e9sultant de son mariage\u2026 que telle renonciation ne pourrait valoir en loi vu qu\u2019elle comporterait un avantage en faveur de sondit \u00e9poux durant le mariage et que tel avantage durant le mariage est r\u00e9prouv\u00e9 par la loi.\nLe jugement avait tenu la renonciation pour valide en s\u2019appuyant sur plusieurs autorit\u00e9s fran\u00e7aises et sur l\u2019arr\u00eat de Boudria v. McLean15. Il admettait, entre autres propositions:\u2014\nThe renunciation of her hypothec is not an indirect advantage, since the personal liability remains. Et dans la cause de Hogue v. Cousineau[18], l\u2019\u00e9pouse apportait en mariage une somme de 5,000 francs qu\u2019elle stipulait propre. Pour lui assurer le remboursement de cette somme, son mari lui donna, par le contrat de mariage pass\u00e9 entre eux, une hypoth\u00e8que sur un immeuble situ\u00e9 sur la rue Beaudry, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Il vendit cet immeuble. Sa femme donna mainlev\u00e9e de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que qu\u2019elle avait pour garantir le remboursement des cinq mille francs; mais, pour remplacer cette hypoth\u00e8que sur l\u2019immeuble vendu, il affecta un autre emplacement acquis par lui \u00e0 Mascouche. Plus tard, le mari vendit cet emplacement et son \u00e9pouse intervint de nouveau pour donner mainlev\u00e9e de cette nouvelle hypoth\u00e8que. Par la suite, l\u2019\u00e9pouse r\u00e9clama ses droits hypoth\u00e9caires sur ces immeubles en pr\u00e9tendant que ces renonciations \u00e9taient nulles. On contesta cette pr\u00e9tention et l\u2019on ajouta que, quant \u00e0 la seconde hypoth\u00e8que substitu\u00e9e \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re stipul\u00e9e par le contrat de mariage, elle n\u2019avait aucune existence parce que le mari n\u2019avait pas le droit de la cr\u00e9er au profit de sa femme.\nM. le juge Jett\u00e9, en rendant le jugement, pose carr\u00e9ment la question:\u2014\nC\u2019est un principe parfaitement admis que la femme ne peut avantager son mari en quoi que ce soit. Or, ici, il y a renonciation non seulement au douaire mais aux droits hypoth\u00e9caires, de la femme sut l\u2019immeuble du mari, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 ses droits hypoth\u00e9caires qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s pour lui garantir ses deniers dotaux. Cette renonciation est-elle valable? Si oui, n\u2019est-il pas clair qu\u2019elle conf\u00e8re ainsi un avantage \u00e9vident \u00e0 son mari?\nIl r\u00e9f\u00e8re alors \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat de Boudria v. McLean[19], et il dit que la doctrine consacr\u00e9e par ce jugement est que la femme mari\u00e9e peut faire les actes qui n\u2019exigent ou ne contiennent de sa part aucune obligation.\nC\u2019est pourquoi (ajoute-t-il) les empereurs Philippe disent dans un rescrit adress\u00e9 \u00e0 une femme au sujet du s\u00e9natus-consulte Vell\u00e9ien qui d\u00e9fendait aux femmes de s\u2019obliger pour autrui: Il est constant en jurisprudence que, m\u00eame durant le mariage, les droits d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que et de gage peuvent \u00eatre remis au mari. (6 Pandectes de Pothier, p. 251).\nIl dit ensuite que cette doctrine a \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9e de nouveau en 1871, par la Cour du Banc de la Reine, dans la cause de Lagorgendi\u00e8re v. Thibaudeau[20]; et il en conclut que si la femme ne peut s\u2019obliger \u00e0 payer autrement que comme commune en biens et non au del\u00e0, sa renonciation \u00e0 ses droits (hypoth\u00e9caires, comme nous l\u2019avons vu, est l\u00e9gale et valable.\nCe jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc de la Reine[21], compos\u00e9e des honorables juges Dorion, Monk, Ramsay, Tessier et Cross.\nDe nouveau, en 1880, re Homier v. Renaud[22], le m\u00eame juge est saisi d\u2019une question semblable. En vertu de son contrat de mariage, l\u2019\u00e9pouse avait une hypoth\u00e8que sur un immeuble pour garantir le paiement d\u2019une rente annuelle et pour la jouissance d\u2019un appartement dans la b\u00e2tisse construite sur cet immeuble. L\u2019immeuble \u00e9tait saisi par le cr\u00e9ancier d\u2019une obligation; et, dans l\u2019acte cr\u00e9ant cette obligation, l\u2019\u00e9pouse avait c\u00e9d\u00e9 priorit\u00e9 d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que pour le paiement de cette cr\u00e9ance. Le rapport fait voir que les droits hypoth\u00e9caires de la femme garantissaient\nle remboursement de ses deniers dotaux et autres avantages stipul\u00e9s \u00e0 son contrat de mariage.\nOn chercha \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une distinction entre cette cause et les esp\u00e8ces pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes parce que dans ces derni\u00e8res\nla femme \u00e9tait commune en biens avec son mari, tandis qu\u2019ici elle est s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens.\nLe jugement d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu de faire cette distinction et maintient la doctrine d\u00e9j\u00e0 expos\u00e9e par le m\u00eame juge dans la cause de Hogue v. Cousineau[23].\nNous avons tenu \u00e0 mentionner ces diff\u00e9rents jugements de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour indiquer le sens que les tribunaux donnaient alors aux arr\u00eats de la Cour du Banc de la Reine re Boudria v. McLean[24] et Lagorgendi\u00e8re v. Thibaudeau[25]. Or, le Conseil Priv\u00e9 fut saisi de ces questions dans la cause de Hamel v. Panet[26]. Le mari, pour assurer et garantir le paiement d\u2019une somme de \u00a3930, avait hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement des terrains d\u00e9crits dans l\u2019acte notari\u00e9. Son \u00e9pouse intervint \u00e0 l\u2019acte pour l\u2019approuver, le confirmer et le ratifier, et consentit\n\u00e0 d\u00e9charger, comme par ces pr\u00e9sentes elle d\u00e9charge, les droits et hypoth\u00e8ques qu\u2019elle a et peut avoir sur les immeubles ci-dessus d\u00e9sign\u00e9s et sp\u00e9cialement hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s par son mari (et) \u00e0 renoncer, comme elle renonce par les pr\u00e9sentes, \u00e0 l\u2019exercice d\u2019aucuns droits soit r\u00e9els de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, soit hypoth\u00e9caires, et tous autres qu\u2019elle aurait droit d\u2019exercer sur les biens de son mari, et sur lesquels elle accorde priorit\u00e9 et rang ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 elle et auxdits cr\u00e9anciers. La convention contenue dans leur contrat de mariage \u00e9tait que, arrivant la dissolution de la communaut\u00e9, la future \u00e9pouse serait libre de l\u2019accepter ou de la refuser; puis, dans le cas de renonciation, de reprendre \u201cfranchement et quittement\u201d tout ce qu\u2019elle justifiera avoir apport\u00e9 \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9, et\nelle en sera garantie et indemnis\u00e9e par et sur les biens dudit futur \u00e9poux qui y sont de ce jour hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s.\nDans la d\u00e9claration qui accompagnait son action, l\u2019\u00e9pouse invoqua son contrat de mariage et pr\u00e9tendit que, nonobstant son intervention \u00e0 l\u2019acte, vu qu\u2019elle avait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 de biens, elle avait droit de reprendre l\u2019immeuble libre de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que \u00e0 laquelle elle avait accord\u00e9 priorit\u00e9 et rang ant\u00e9rieur.\nA l\u2019argument devant le Conseil Priv\u00e9, M. Benjamin, qui repr\u00e9sentait les appelants, invoqua les arr\u00eats de la Cour du Banc de la Reine pour soumettre la proposition que la femme mari\u00e9e pouvait renoncer \u00e0 son hypoth\u00e8que sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de son mari.\nLe jugement du Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire fut prononc\u00e9 par Lord Selborne et contient le passage suivant:\u2014\nThe other authorities also go to the effect that, although there may be in a deed an ineffectual attempt to bind a married woman by words of obligation, yet a renunciation of this kind in the same deed is perfectly good. Two decisions of the Courts of Lower Canada are referred to in the record; both of which determined that the renunciation and the consent of the wife to her husband\u2019s act, as against such rights as she might have under a marriage contract, whether of hypothec or of reprise, may be good, although she could not bind herself by a direct contract, which she had attempted to do in the same deed. Their Lordships see no reason to differ from those decisions.\nEnfin, Sir A. A. Dorion, re The Bank of Toronto v. Perkins[27], fut amen\u00e9 \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer cette question et dit au cours de son jugement o\u00f9 il exprime l\u2019opinion unanime de la Cour du Banc de la Reine:\u2014\nI am of opinion that a married woman separated as to property could give to a creditor of her husband priority over her own claims on his property. This is not a liability which she contracts for the debt of her husband, and which is prohibited by article 1301 C.C. There is nothing in the law to prevent her from paying the debts of her husband or from disposing of her property to do so. Here she has merely relinquished a right of preference which she had and this is not prohibited by law.\nEt il r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 la jurisprudence que nous venons de r\u00e9sumer.\nOn peut ajouter \u00e0 ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de l\u2019arr\u00eat re Donnelly v. Cooper[28]. Tous ces jugements pouvaient d\u2019ailleurs se r\u00e9clamer de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de Pothier, dans son Trait\u00e9 des donations entre mari et femme (Bugnet, 3e \u00e9d., vol. 7, n\u00b0 31):\u2014\nLa remise qu\u2019une femme fait \u00e0 son mari d\u2019un droit d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que qu\u2019elle a sur un h\u00e9ritage de son mari, en consentant \u00e0 la vente qu\u2019il en fait, est valable, et n\u2019est point regard\u00e9e comme une donation prohib\u00e9e entre mari et femme: Si pignus vir uxori vel uxor marito remiserit, verlor sententia est nullam fieri donationem existimantium; L. 18, ff. qu\u0153 in fraud. La raison est que la remise qui est faite au conjoint de ce droit d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que, n\u2019apportant aucune diminution \u00e0 sa dette, ne le rend pas plus riche qu\u2019il ne l\u2019\u00e9tait auparavant. Or, c\u2019est un principe de droit romain, qu\u2019il n\u2019y a de donations prohib\u00e9es, entre homme et femme, que celles par lesquelles l\u2019un s\u2019enrichit aux d\u00e9pens de l\u2019autre: Ubicumque non deminuit de facultatibus suis qui donavit; vel etiam si deminuat, locupletior tarnen non sit qui accepit, donatio valet: L. 6, parag. 16, ff de Donat. inter vir. et ux.\nNous croyons donc que l\u2019intim\u00e9e pouvait, sans violer l\u2019article 1265 du code civil, valablement renoncer, dans l\u2019acte de vente de son mari \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 consentie par son contrat de mariage. Cela r\u00e9sulte d\u2019une jurisprudence \u00e9tablie depuis au del\u00e0 de cinquante ans et confirm\u00e9e par le Conseil Priv\u00e9. Cela s\u2019accorde d\u2019ailleurs avec le principe de la libre disposition des biens qui tend \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter strictement les articles de la loi prescrivant l\u2019inali\u00e9nabilit\u00e9.\nComme le dit Laurent (vol. 21, n\u00b0 73, 2e alin\u00e9a):\u2014\nL\u2019irr\u00e9vocabilit\u00e9 de ce qui est convenu par contrat de mariage n\u2019est pas l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de contracter, en laissant ces conventions intactes. Sinon on aboutirait \u00e0 immobiliser la condition des biens, tels qu\u2019ils existent lors de la c\u00e9l\u00e9bration du mariage: les \u00e9poux ne pourraient vendre, ni donner \u00e0 bail, ni faire aucune esp\u00e8ce de convention relative \u00e0 ces biens, parce que toute nouvelle convention apporte une innovation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat de choses qui existait lors du contrat de mariage. La cour de Bruxelles l\u2019a jug\u00e9 ainsi en principe, et la chose n\u2019est pas douteuse, (Bruxelles, 9 mars 1853. Pasicrisie, 1853, 2, 186.)\nEt nous pourrons terminer en citant ce passage de Bau-dry-Lacantinerie:\u2014\nEn posant la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui domine tout notre sujet, nous avons eu soin de faire remarquer que, si le donataire ne peut pas abdiquer ni compromettre son droit, il lui est au contraire permis de l\u2019exercer et de le transf\u00e9rer.\nLes actes \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux ou \u00e0 titre gratuit, pass\u00e9s pendant la dur\u00e9e du mariage, non avec le donateur mais avec des tiers par l\u2019\u00e9poux donataire, ne sont donc pas contraires \u00e0 l\u2019article 1395. Ces actes seront, le plus souvent, l\u2019exercice normal du droit du donataire, et cela, alors m\u00eame qu\u2019ils affecteraient la forme d\u2019une renonciation. Renoncer au profit d\u2019un tiers ne constitue point une simple abdication, mais bien un acte de disposition. En effet, pour en assurer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice \u00e0 d\u2019autres qu\u2019\u00e0 ceux qui devraient en profiter si la renonciation \u00e9tait pure et simple, ou m\u00eame pour le r\u00e9partir entre eux autrement, le pr\u00e9tendu renon\u00e7ant doit d\u2019abord accepter le droit, puis en faire donation. Il y a l\u00e0, comme Ta dit la cour de cassation, \u201cun acte personnel de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 qui n\u2019est que l\u2019exercice m\u00eame du droit qui en est l\u2019objet\u201d. (Civ. cass., 1 juill. 1889, S. 91. 1. 101, D. 90. 1.123). Trait\u00e9 de Droit Civil, vol. 16. Du contrat de mariage, tome 1er, n\u00b0 113.\nNous n\u2019avons pas parl\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019appelant que les avantages conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e par son mari dans le contrat de mariage avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9s pour tenir lieu de douaire, d\u2019o\u00f9 l\u2019appelant tirait la conclusion que la renonciation \u00e0 ces avantages pouvait se justifier par l\u2019article 1444 du code civil.\nLe contrat de mariage en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne dit pas que par les donations conf\u00e9r\u00e9es par le mari \u00e0 sa femme les \u00e9poux ont entendu constituer un douaire prefix. Au contraire, le contrat dit que,\nen consid\u00e9ration des susdits donations et avantages, la future \u00e9pouse renonce pour elle et ses enfants \u00e0 tout douaire.\nAdmettre la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019appelant sur ce point \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 dire que chaque fois que les conventions matrimoniales conf\u00e8rent un avantage \u00e0 la femme en consid\u00e9ration de sa renonciation \u00e0 son douaire, on a entendu par l\u00e0 accorder un douaire prefix. Nous croyons qu\u2019il faut une clause expresse. En l\u2019absence d\u2019une indication sp\u00e9ciale, m\u00eame si les avantages matrimoniaux sont consid\u00e9rables, ils ne peuvent faire pr\u00e9sumer que l\u2019on a voulu exclure le douaire coutumier. (Guyot, R\u00e9pertoire, verbo Douaire, pp. 282, 283 et 284.)\nDe la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on,-il est n\u00e9cessaire de mentionner dans le contrat de mariage, lorsque le mari conf\u00e8re des avantages et des lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s \u00e0 sa femme, qu\u2019il entend par l\u00e0 constituer un douaire prefix (Valli\u00e8res v. Villeneuve[29].)\nMais l\u2019appelant doit r\u00e9ussir pour les autres raisons que nous avons expos\u00e9es dans ces notes; et nous sommes donc d\u2019avis de faire droit \u00e0 l\u2019appel et de renvoyer l\u2019action avec d\u00e9pens tant devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure que devant cette cour.

City of Montreal, [1927] S.C.R. 213\nDate: 1927-01-04\nCharles J. Lewis (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nThe City of Montreal (Plaintiff), Respondent.\n1926: October 21; 1927: January 4.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nMunicipal corporation\u2014Action en bornage\u2014Right to exercise\u2014Boundary line between street and contiguous lot\u2014Homologated line not equivalent to bornage\u2014Art. 504 C.C.\nHeld that, in the absence of special statutory provisions derogating from the general terms of article 504 of the civil code, a municipal corporation can exercise the action en bornage in order to settle the boundaries between a street and a contiguous private land.\nHeld also that, when a line shown on a plan approved by a municipal council and duly homologated by the court, fixes the limits between a street and the adjoining lots, even although such plan be declared by the legislature final and binding upon the owners of the lots and the municipal corporation, the latter is not precluded from instituting an action en bornage and is also liable to be sued in a similar action, as the general powers of homologation are not inconsistent with the terms of article 504 of the civil code.\nThe city of Montreal, under the authority of the statute 1 Geo. V (2nd s.) 1911, c. 60, passed by-law no. 436 which provides that \u201cit shall be the duty of the city surveyor to establish and fix the alignment and level of the streets * * *\u201d and that \u201cevery person desiring to erect a building in any street * * * must previously obtain from the city surveyor the alignment and level of such street * * *.\u201d\nHeld that the terms of this by-law do not constitute a special method to settle the boundary line between the streets and the contiguous lots in the city of Montreal, so as to deprive the latter of its right to exercise the action en bornage which is an action accessory to its rights of ownership. This by-law is a purely administrative regulation passed in favour of those who intend to build on these lots and does not possess the essential features of a legal \u201cbornage.\u201d\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 40 K.B. 205) aff.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action en bornage.\nThe city of Montreal as owner of subdivision lot 807 of lot 168 and subdivision lot 787 of lot 169 of the official plan and book of reference of the parish of Montreal, these subdivision lots forming part of Notre Dame de Gr\u00e2ce Avenue (formerly Church Avenue), demanded a bornage of the appellant who is the owner of subdivision lots 809,906 and 854 of lot 168 and subdivision 887 of lot 169. These subdivision lots front on Notre Dame de Gr\u00e2ce Avenue adjoining the city\u2019s lots 807 and 787, which latter lots form the street at that point.\nThe city alleged that it had been troubled by the appellant in its possession and enjoyment; that its land and the land of the appellant had never been bounded and, complaining of an encroachment by Lewis, claimed that it was entitled to demand a bornage of the properties according to law and the respective rights of the parties.\nThe conclusions of the declaration pray that the land of the city and of the appellant be bounded according to law and the titles and possession of the parties and that, to this end, the parties be held to immediately appoint a surveyor or surveyors to draw and fix the lines of division between their respective properties and to place bornes according to law and that, failing the nomination by the appellant of a surveyor, one be appointed by the court to proceed to this bornage.\nThe issues raised by the appellant were:\nFirst: That the legislature has given the city power to fix the line and level of streets and to compel every person building to obtain such line and level;\nSecond: That the legislature gave the former municipality of Notre Dame de Gr\u00e2ce the power to have a plan of the streets of the municipality made, which plan, after being homologated and confirmed by the Superior Court, should be final, decisive and binding on the corporation and proprietors and all other persons; that under the authority of this statute the municipality caused a plan to be made, which was duly homologated and confirmed by judgment of the Superior Court. The municipality of Notre Dame de Gr\u00e2ce became part of the city of Montreal in 1910 and the city was substituted for the town of Notre Dame de Gr\u00e2ce in all its rights and obligations.\nThird: That before building he obtained from the city of Montreal lines and levels, which were indicated by pickets placed by the proper officials of the city. The Superior Court found that there was a special procedure provided to fix and determine street lines and that the line which the city asked the court to have determined had already been legally determined and was final, decisive and binding upon the city and the proprietors interested and upon all other persons.\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench reversed this judgment on the ground that neither the homologated plan nor the lines and levels given by the city were equivalent to a bornage.\nH. N. Chauvin K.C. and John T. Hackett K.C. for the appellant.\nC. Laurendeau K.C for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014A la date du 13 octobre 1920, lorsqu\u2019elle institua son action, la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019avenue Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ces, une rue situ\u00e9e dans un des quartiers de la ville. L\u2019appelant \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de certains lots de terre contigus au c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord-ouest de cette avenue et il y avait \u00e9rig\u00e9 des maisons. La cit\u00e9 pr\u00e9tendait que certaines de ces maisons empi\u00e9taient sur l\u2019avenue et, all\u00e9guant que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s respectives des parties n\u2019avaient jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 born\u00e9es, prit contre l\u2019appelant les conclusions ordinaires d\u2019une action en bornage.\nLa d\u00e9fense fut qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 l\u2019appelant construisit ces maisons, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire en 1914 et 1915, les officiers de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al avaient, \u00e0 sa demande, fix\u00e9 l\u2019alignement et le niveau de l\u2019avenue Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ces conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la charte et aux r\u00e8glements. L\u2019appelant s\u2019\u00e9tait conform\u00e9 aux indications ainsi fournies. Cette op\u00e9ration, selon lui, constituait un bornage \u00e0 l\u2019amiable, et il n\u2019y avait pas lieu \u00e0 l\u2019intervention judiciaire.\nLa question ainsi soulev\u00e9e est nouvelle. Elle est int\u00e9ressante et elle est d\u2019importance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nEn vertu de l\u2019article 504 du code civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec,\ntout propri\u00e9taire peut obliger soa voisin au bornage de leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s contigu\u00ebs.\nLe pr\u00e9cepte est absolu et para\u00eet \u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. C\u2019est, comme l\u2019enseigne Demolombe, un droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00eame et qui est n\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps qu\u2019elle:\nil est fond\u00e9 non-seulement sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat priv\u00e9 des parties, mais sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLe texte ne fait ni distinction, ni exception. Habituellement, dans le droit de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, le terrain occup\u00e9 par un chemin municipal ou par une rue appartient \u00e0 la corporation sous la direction de laquelle il est plac\u00e9. Il en est ainsi dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019une loi d\u00e9rogeant aux termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de l\u2019article 504 C.C., rien ne para\u00eet emp\u00eacher une corporation municipale d\u2019exercer, suivant les r\u00e8gles du droit commun, cette action accessoire \u00e0 son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e a affirm\u00e9 devant cette cour que cette question n\u2019avait jamais fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un arr\u00eat de nos tribunaux; et cette affirmation nous para\u00eet exacte.\nCependant, dans une poursuite intent\u00e9e par l\u2019Honorable G. Irvine, procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, contre le maire et le conseil de la ville d\u2019Iberville[2], o\u00f9 l\u2019on reprochait \u00e0 cette municipalit\u00e9 des actes faits en violation de sa charte, l\u2019on se plaignait que la ville avait fait planter des bornes entre les rues et les terrains des particuliers qui les avoisinaient, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer par l\u00e0 la limite de chaque rue sans avoir obtenu le consentement des particuliers \u00e0 ce bornage, et, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de tel consentement, sans avoir pris les proc\u00e9dures ordinaires en bornage devant les tribunaux.\nMonsieur le juge Chagnon, en d\u00e9clarant ill\u00e9gale la r\u00e9solution du conseil \u00e0 l\u2019effet d\u2019autoriser un d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 aller planter les bornes en compagnie d\u2019un arpenteur, s\u2019exprima comme suit:\u2014\nIl faut avouer que le conseil a adopt\u00e9 un moyen sommaire de parvenir au bornage de ses rues. Le bornage entre des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s constate la limite des h\u00e9ritages des deux voisins, et non pas seulement d\u2019un seul. Si les deux voisins ne s\u2019accordent pas sur l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 doit \u00eatre plac\u00e9e la borne, il faut donc qu\u2019une autorit\u00e9 intervienne pour fixer cet endroit. L\u2019autorit\u00e9 en cette circonstance n\u2019est autre que la cour, qui sur une action en bornage, entend les deux parties, et fixe d\u00e9finitivement la limite, apr\u00e8s avoir pris en consid\u00e9ration les pr\u00e9tentions et les titres de chaque partie. Il n\u2019y a pas de bornage possible suivant la loi, que le bornage volontaire entre les deux voisins, et le bornage judiciaire sur action en bornage. Une corporation est-elle plus privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e que les particuliers, et peut-elle se soustraire \u00e0 ces r\u00e8gles; qui sont de toute justice? La loi n\u2019en fait pas d\u2019exception, on con\u00e7oit d\u2019ailleurs jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quel point une loi qui permettrait \u00e0 une corporation d\u2019aller planter des bornes sur les terrains des particuliers, sans aucune notification aux parties et sans le consentement de ces derni\u00e8res, serait arbitraire. Le droit sacr\u00e9 de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ne serait plus alors respect\u00e9, et les corporations seraient les seules ma\u00eetresses, et pourraient \u00e0 leur gr\u00e9, par leurs bornages faits purement ex parte, envahir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e.\nMonsieur le juge Charbonneau fut d\u2019avis contraire dans la cause de La corporation de la paroisse de Sainte-Victoire v. Paul Hus[3]. La demanderesse concluait \u00e0 ce que le d\u00e9fendeur fut condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 enlever une d\u00e9pendance de sa fromagerie parce qu\u2019elle empi\u00e9tait sur la route. Le d\u00e9fendeur, par voie d\u2019inscription en droit, pr\u00e9tendit que la corporation municipale pouvait se servir de ses pouvoirs administratifs pour faire dispara\u00eetre l\u2019empi\u00e9tement \u00e0 titre de nuisance, si c\u2019en \u00e9tait une; qu\u2019elle pouvait avoir recours \u00e0 l\u2019action en bornage; mais qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas droit \u00e0 l\u2019action possessoire dans l\u2019an et jour, vu que ce rem\u00e8de \u00e9tait prescrit \u00e0 la face m\u00eame des proc\u00e9dures. L\u2019inscription en droit fut rejet\u00e9e pour la raison\nqu\u2019en mati\u00e8re de voirie, le bornage se trouve fait d\u00e9finitivement par la localisation actuelle du chemin fait par l\u2019autorit\u00e9 municipale, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce les sous-voyers, localisation qui est faite contradictoirement avec les propri\u00e9taires des immeubles riverains, et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il ne peut y avoir lieu au bornage comme entre particuliers.\nEn pronon\u00e7ant sur le fond du litige, monsieur le juge\nCharbonneau revient sur la question et dit:\nCette route a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment localis\u00e9e par les foss\u00e9s et les cl\u00f4tures de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9, ce que l\u2019on doit pr\u00e9sumer avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente de l\u2019\u00e9poque et sans contestation, et \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 l\u00e9gitime bornage entre la route et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du d\u00e9fendeur.\nD\u2019autre part, la Cour de Revision, dans deux instances post\u00e9rieures au jugement pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent (La corporation de la paroisse de Saint-Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier de Brompton v. Salois[4]; Morrissette v. The Corporation of the Parish of St. Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier de Brompton[5]) a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9e \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer cette question.\nDans la premi\u00e8re cause, Salois \u00e9tait accus\u00e9 d\u2019empi\u00e9ter sur le terrain du chemin. Pour les raisons particuli\u00e8res \u00e0 cette esp\u00e8ce et qui sont expos\u00e9es dans le jugement, la cour fut d\u2019avis qu\u2019une action possessoire de la part de la corporation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e mal \u00e0 propos; mais elle ajoute \u201cqu\u2019une action en bornage e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 la proc\u00e9dure convenable \u201d C\u2019\u00e9tait donc reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019il y avait ouverture \u00e0 l\u2019action en bornage pour marquer les bornes entre un chemin et un terrain priv\u00e9 contigu.\nLa cause de Morissette doit \u00eatre mentionn\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle fait voir qu\u2019il y avait eu ant\u00e9rieurement entre les parties une action en bornage au sujet de la ligne s\u00e9parative entre le chemin du village et le terrain appartenant \u00e0 Morissette. Un jugement final avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu d\u00e9limitant cette ligne s\u00e9parative et fixant l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 les bornes devaient \u00eatre plant\u00e9es. La preuve d\u00e9montrait que le jugement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 et les bornes plac\u00e9es. La Cour de Revision reconnut la validit\u00e9 de ce bornage sans que personne ne songe\u00e2t \u00e0 soulever l\u2019inapplicabilit\u00e9 des r\u00e8gles du droit commun aux rapports de voisinage entre les chemins et les fonds riverains.\nOn ne peut, pour la solution du probl\u00e8me, avoir recours \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des commentateurs fran\u00e7ais, source ordinaire o\u00f9 l\u2019on puise tant d\u2019\u00e9claircissements sur le texte du code civil. Le r\u00e9gime de la voirie y est diff\u00e9rent. Les objets qui font partie du domaine public ou communal y sont subordonn\u00e9s aux r\u00e8gles du droit public et administratif (Pardessus, Trait\u00e9 des servitudes, tome I, n\u00b0 118; Demolombe, Des servitudes, tome I, page 305). Le bornage proprement dit y est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence des juges de paix et soustrait \u00e0 la juridiction ordinaire d\u00e9s tribunaux.\nToutefois, m\u00eame avec l\u2019organisation d\u2019un syst\u00e8me qui n\u2019est pas semblable \u00e0 celui du Qu\u00e9bec, le bornage op\u00e9r\u00e9 par les autorit\u00e9s administratives ne fait pas obstacle \u00e0 ce que les tribunaux statuent sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du domaine national ou municipal (Fuzier-Herman, R\u00e9pertoire, verbo Bornage, n\u00b0 394; Baudry-Lacantinerie, 3e \u00e9d., vol. 6, n\u00b0 907); et l\u2019autorit\u00e9 judiciaire y est comp\u00e9tente pour conna\u00eetre des actions en bornage formul\u00e9es par les communes contre les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s contigu\u00ebs au chemin vicinal, et r\u00e9ciproquement, lorsque le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est mis en question.\nDans l\u2019affaire Larch\u00e9 v. La Commune de Beyre-le-Chatel[6], la commune avait demand\u00e9 devant le tribunal civil de Dijon qu\u2019il f\u00fbt proc\u00e9d\u00e9 au bornage et \u00e0 la d\u00e9limitation du chemin avec la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Larch\u00e9. A cette fin, elle concluait \u00e0 la nomination d\u2019experts qui recevraient instruction de proc\u00e9der tout comme il est pourvu aux articles 1059 et suivants du code de proc\u00e9dure civile de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et qui d\u00e9termineraient l\u2019\u00e9tendue des usurpations faites sur le chemin par Larch\u00e9. Larch\u00e9 opposa \u00e0 la demande propos\u00e9e contre lui une fin de non-recevoir prise d\u2019une loi qui chargeait l\u2019administration de faire rechercher et reconna\u00eetre les anciennes limites du chemin vicinal.\nLa Cour de Cassation reconnut qu\u2019il n\u2019appartenait qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la juridiction administrative de rechercher et de fixer les limites de ces chemins\net de r\u00e9primer toutes contraventions aux actes de l\u2019administration en cette mati\u00e8re.\nElle d\u00e9cida cependant qu\u2019il n\u2019en restait pas moins\ndans les attributions exclusives des tribunaux, de conna\u00eetre de toutes les questions de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou d\u00e9rivant de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui peuvent s\u2019\u00e9lever relativement \u00e0 ces chemins, soit que leur vicinalit\u00e9 ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e ou non par l\u2019autorit\u00e9 administrative; (et que) c\u2019est aux tribunaux seuls qu\u2019il appartient de conna\u00eetre d\u2019une action en bornage intent\u00e9e par une commune contre un propri\u00e9taire riverain d\u2019un chemin de cette commune, encore que cette action n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite qu\u2019\u00e0 raison d\u2019une pr\u00e9tendue usurpation de partie de ce chemin.\nS\u2019il en est ainsi m\u00eame en France o\u00f9 Ton a confi\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019administration seule le pouvoir de fixer la limite des objets qui d\u00e9pendent du domaine public, \u00e0 plus forte raison nous faudrait-il ici (o\u00f9 le droit municipal n\u2019a pas sur ce point d\u00e9rog\u00e9 au droit priv\u00e9) d\u00e9couvrir une loi sp\u00e9ciale et exceptionnelle pour d\u00e9cider qu\u2019une corporation municipale est priv\u00e9e des avantages et soustraite aux obligations de l\u2019article 504 du code civil. C\u2019est cette loi que l\u2019appelant nous invite \u00e0 trouver dans le statut de Qu\u00e9bec, 40 Vict., c. 39, qui a conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la municipalit\u00e9 du village de Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ces Ouest le droit de pr\u00e9parer un plan de ses rues, chemins, parcs, etc., en y d\u00e9signant leur alignement, et de le faire homologuer par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nL\u2019avenue Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ces \u00e9tait originairement dans ce village et fait maintenant partie de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al par suite d\u2019une annexion. Avant l\u2019annexion, le village s\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9valu du pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par le statut 40 Vict., et avait fait pr\u00e9parer un plan par monsieur J.-P.-B. Casgrain, arpenteur jur\u00e9 de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Son conseil l\u2019avait approuv\u00e9, et ce plan avait \u00e9t\u00e9 homologu\u00e9 par un jugement de la cour en date du 21 septembre 1896. Le statut d\u00e9clare que ce plan ainsi confirm\u00e9 par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure\nsera final, d\u00e9cisif et obligatoire pour la dite corporation et pour les propri\u00e9taires qui y sont int\u00e9ress\u00e9s et pour toutes les autres personnes.\nLa corporation y est munie de tous les pouvoirs n\u00e9cessaires pour ouvrir, lorsqu\u2019elle jugera avantageux de le faire, les rues, chemins ou places ainsi indiqu\u00e9s sur le plan. L\u2019appelant voit dans ce statut une proc\u00e9dure sp\u00e9ciale incompatible avec les articles 504 C.C. et 1059 C.P.C.\nIl n\u2019y a dans cette loi particuli\u00e8re rien de diff\u00e9rent des pouvoirs qui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 toutes les cit\u00e9s et villes de la province de Qu\u00e9bec par la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui les concerne (S.R.Q. (1925), c. 102, arts. 430 et suiv.; S.R.Q. (1909), arts. 5642 et suiv.) Le statut sp\u00e9cial de Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ces, de m\u00eame que la loi des cit\u00e9s et villes, permet de \u201ctracer et localiser\u201d les rues, les chemins, routes, avenues, places publiques, etc. Il a surtout pour but de limiter \u00e0 la date de la confirmation du plan l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 et les dommages qui pourront \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9s par les propri\u00e9taires par suite de la construction des rues et places publiques indiqu\u00e9es dans ce plan. Mais le statut est silencieux sur la question du droit au bornage, surtout sur l\u2019op\u00e9ration mat\u00e9rielle et physique du bornage. A ce point de vue, il n\u2019y a pas de divergence essentielle entre l\u2019autorisation qui est par l\u00e0 donn\u00e9e aux cit\u00e9s et villes ou au village de Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ces de fixer d\u2019avance sur un plan le trac\u00e9 et l\u2019emplacement des rues, etc., et celle qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 tout propri\u00e9taire le droit de subdiviser son terrain et d\u2019en d\u00e9poser, d\u2019abord au bureau du commissaire des terres de la Couronne, puis au bureau du r\u00e9gistrateur de la division, un plan et livre de renvoi par lui certifi\u00e9s, avec des num\u00e9ros et d\u00e9signations particuli\u00e8res de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 distinguer les nouveaux lots des lots primitifs (art. 2175 C.C.)\nLa d\u00e9limitation sur ce plan de chacun de ces lots de subdivision ne constitue \u00e9videmment pas un bornage et ne soustrait pas leur propri\u00e9taire aux obligations de l\u2019article 504 du code civil.\nIl en serait de m\u00eame de toute municipalit\u00e9 rurale qui, en vertu du code municipal, d\u00e9ciderait la construction et l\u2019ouverture d\u2019un nouveau chemin au moyen d\u2019un r\u00e8glement auquel serait annex\u00e9 un plan contenant le trac\u00e9 et la description du chemin. L\u2019indication des lignes du chemin sur le plan ne pourrait constituer un bornage. Comme le dit M. le juge Tellier,\nce n\u2019est pas sur le papier, mais sur le terrain, que se fait un bornage.\nMais l\u2019appelant ne s\u2019en tient pas l\u00e0. Par la loi I Geo. V (2e session), 1911, c. 60, la l\u00e9gislature a ins\u00e9r\u00e9 dans la charte de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al le pouvoir par le conseil de la cit\u00e9 de faire un r\u00e8glement:\u2014\n9 la. Pour faire \u00e9tablir et fixer par (les officiers de la ville) l\u2019alignement et le niveau de toute rue, ruelle et place publique; pour obliger quiconque construit sur une rue, ruelle ou place publique \u00e0 obtenir de la cit\u00e9 l\u2019alignement et le niveau de telle rue, ruelle ou place publique, et \u00e0 signer un proc\u00e8s-verbal \u00e0 cet effet dont une copie lui sera livr\u00e9e, s\u2019il en fait la demande, sur paiement d\u2019une somme n\u2019exc\u00e9dant pas deux piastres.\nA la suite de cet amendement \u00e0 sa charte, la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al a adopt\u00e9 le r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 436, par lequel il fut ordonn\u00e9 comme suit:\u2014\nSect. 1. It shall be the duty of the city surveyor to establish and fix the alignment and level of the streets, lanes and public squares in the city.\nSect. 2. Every person desiring to erect a building in any street, lane or public place, in the city, must previously obtain from the city surveyor the alignment and level of such street, land or public place and sign a minute to that effect, a copy whereof shall be delivered to him, at his request, on payment of an amount of two dollars.\nLe r\u00e8glement contient, en outre, une section 3 qui pourvoit \u00e0 la sanction.\nL\u2019appelant soumet, et le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance a consid\u00e9r\u00e9, que ce r\u00e8glement \u00e9tablissait une m\u00e9thode sp\u00e9ciale pour fixer et d\u00e9limiter la ligne separative entre les rues et les fonds riverains dans la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al; par suite de quoi la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait plus ouverture \u00e0 l\u2019action en bornage en pareil cas.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi en appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimement d\u2019avis contraire, et nous partageons son opinion.\nEn fait, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qui nous occupe, la proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9vue par l\u2019amendement n\u00b0 91a et le r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 436 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie, et l\u2019appelant ne saurait s\u2019en r\u00e9clamer. Il est prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 l\u2019alignement et le niveau de l\u2019avenue Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ces. Monsieur Campbell, employ\u00e9 au d\u00e9partement des lignes et niveaux, au printemps de 1914, para\u00eet avoir plac\u00e9 deux piquets sur l\u2019avenue Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ces; et le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure d\u00e9clare que par l\u00e0 il a voulu indiquer aux Cela veut dire que les lois g\u00e9n\u00e9rales confient la fonction d\u2019assurer la permanence de l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 des h\u00e9ritages \u00e0 des experts, choisis \u00e0 raison de leur comp\u00e9tence sp\u00e9ciale en la mati\u00e8re. Ces experts sont ind\u00e9pendants des parties, puisque, pour rappeler le mot de Demolombe, il ne s\u2019agit pas seulement de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat priv\u00e9, mais de \u201cl\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9\u201d.\nIl faudrait vraiment un texte bien explicite pour supposer que le parlement aurait voulu conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al le privil\u00e8ge exceptionnel de faire borner ses rues par des officiers, de qui la charte n\u2019exige aucune qualification professionnelle, et de trancher ainsi des questions relatives \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 entre elle et ses contribuables par le minist\u00e8re de ses propres fonctionnaires.\nLe contribuable ne peut \u00eatre tenu d\u2019accepter la ligne que le fonctionnaire lui indique; et, s\u2019ils ne peuvent s\u2019entendre, il faut l\u2019action en bornage. De m\u00eame, elle est n\u00e9cessaire lorsque, comme dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le contribuable a omis, avant de construire, de requ\u00e9rir l\u2019alignement de la rue. Il faut, en effet, en vertu du r\u00e8glement et de la charte, que le propri\u00e9taire demande cet alignement. C\u2019est \u00e0 lui qu\u2019appartient l\u2019initiative. Et s\u2019il construit sans avoir, de cette fa\u00e7on, provoqu\u00e9 entre lui-m\u00eame et la cit\u00e9 l\u2019accord n\u00e9cessaire sur l\u2019emplacement de la ligne separative, la cit\u00e9 n\u2019a plus d\u2019autre rem\u00e8de que celui auquel elle a eu recours dans la cause actuelle, car il est essentiel au bornage l\u00e9gal qu\u2019il y ait un accord entre les parties, sauf, bien entendu, le cas de l\u2019intervention judiciaire (Lalaure, Servitudes, sur art. 646 C.N.; Toullier, n\u00b0 172; Larocquev.

L\u2019appelant ne saurait pr\u00e9tendre que cet acte peut avoir pour effet de constituer le domaine municipal, avec la cons\u00e9quence que, sous pr\u00e9texte de d\u00e9limiter ce domaine, l\u2019officier de la cit\u00e9 pourrait empi\u00e9ter arbitrairement sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e.\nLe statut f\u00e9d\u00e9ral (57-58 Vict., c. 48) qu\u2019avait \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter la Cour du Banc du Roi dans la cause de La compagnie des chars urbains de Montr\u00e9al v. Les commissaires du havre de Montr\u00e9al[9] \u00e9tait tout diff\u00e9rent. Il contenait une disposition sp\u00e9ciale quant au bornage du port de Montr\u00e9al. L\u2019article 7 de l\u2019acte \u00e9dictait:\u2014\nThe commissioners may erect landmarks to indicate the said boundaries of the port of Montreal and of the harbour of Montreal, which landmarks shall be held to determine the said boundaries.\nComme le fait remarquer M. le juge Carroll en pronon\u00e7ant le jugement de la cour,\nCet article autorise les commissaires \u00e0 borner eux-m\u00eames la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du havre, sans \u00eatre Oblig\u00e9s de recourir aux proc\u00e9dures ordinaires.\nCependant, m\u00eame dans ce sens, la Cour du Banc du Roi a exprim\u00e9 l\u2019opinion que cette disposition n\u2019enlevait\naucun des droits des propri\u00e9taires riverains quant au bornage, car s\u2019ils ne sont pas satisfaits des bornes pos\u00e9es par les commissaires, ils ont toujours leur action en rectification de bornes.\nDans l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel de la loi de Qu\u00e9bec, la servitude du bornage affecte toute propri\u00e9t\u00e9, sans distinction du domaine municipal ou priv\u00e9.

The respondent is an hospital board organized under The Municipal Hospitals Act, R.S.A., 1922, c. 116. Late in the night of April 8th, 1924, the appellant was brought to the hospital by his family physician, to be operated on for a ruptured appendix. The latter assisted his partner who performed the operation, the anaesthetic being administered by a third physician. Two qualified nurses were in attendance, Mrs. T. the matron of the hospital and Miss S. As a part of the treatment and to combat the shock of the operation, the bed in which the appellant was to be placed after the operation required to be heated, and for that purpose two rubber hot water bottles, placed inside flannelette bags, were filled in the kitchen by Mrs. T., the water according to her statement being \"quite hot.\" The appellant was removed from the operating table and put in the bed which was placed in the hall outside. The next morning, when he recovered consciousness, it was discovered that his left leg had been severely burned near the ankle by one of these hot water bottles which was found lying next to his skin and inside the blanket which was still tucked around his legs and feet and apparently had not been disturbed during the night. The appellant sued for damages. The trial judge gave judgment for $5,182, finding that the proximate cause of the accident was the filling of the bottle with water that was much too hot without any testing of it and the failure to investigate and see if any adjustment was necessary. The appellate court reversed this judgment, holding on the authority of Hillyer v. Governors of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, [1909] 2 K.B. 820, that the respondent hospital was not liable in damages.\nHeld that the respondent hospital cannot claim exemption from liability on the ground that it was \"a government agency not liable for the negligence of its servants\" or \"a public body carrying on work not for profit but for the benefit of the residents of the district.\"Mersey Docks and Harbour Board Trustees v. Gibb (1 Eng. Gr. App. 93) foll. The Sanitary Commissioners of Gibraltar v. Orfila ((1890) 15 A.C. 400) dist.\nHeld, also, Idington and Mignault JJ. dissenting, that the decision in Hillyer v. St. Bartholomew's Hospital ([1909] 2 K.B. 820) was not applicable to the circumstances of this case. That decision is not authority for non-responsibility of an hospital corporation for neglect by a nurse occurring after the patient has left the operating room and in regard to matters which fall within the scope of her ordinary duties as the heating of a patient's bed and the placing of hot water bottles in it. Even assuming that the placing of the hot water bottle which burned the appellant took place while the appellant was still in the operating room under the orders and control of the operating surgeon and his assistants, it is in evidence that, some time after the appellant had been removed to the hall, the nurse S. noticed a marked reddening of the skin about his chest where another hot water bottle had been placed; and the failure of the nurse to make sure that the other hot water bottle against the leg was not a source of danger is inexcusable and amounts to negligence in her capacity as a servant of the hospital in a matter of ministerial ward duty which entailed responsibility of that body for its consequences. The obligation undertaken by the hospital was not merely to supply properly qualified nurses but to nurse the appellant; and it was the negligence of its servant in the discharge of that contractual obligation that caused the severe injury of which the appellant complains.\nPer Idington and Mignault JJ. dissenting.\u2014The present case falls within the ratio decidendi of the Hillyer Case. The respondent hospital cannot be held liable for the result of a treatment professionally administered to a patient by physicians and nurses placed under the orders of the physicians when the hospital board have exercised proper care in the employment of the physicians and nurses.\nAmongst the regulations enacted for the government of the respondent hospital was regulation no. 9 which provided that \"patients accepting such service or treatment, personally assume all risk and responsibility for any accident, injury or casualty of any kind which may happen to befall any patient, visitor or other person, in the exigencies of such an institution, whether caused by the acts of any of the employees, staff or otherwise.\"\nHeld, that the regulation no. 9 invoked by the respondent as relieving it from responsibility to the appellant is ineffectual for that purpose, both because as a regulation it transcends any power of regulation and management conferred by s. 49 of the statute (R.S., Alta. (1922), c. 116), and because such notice to the plaintiff of its existence as might, under some circumstances, make it an implied term of a contract between the respondent and a patient, has not been shewn. Idington and Mignault JJ. expressing no opinion.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1] reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Ives J., and dismissing the appellant's action for damages for injuries sustained by him while a patient in the respondent hospital. The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and H. A. Friedman for the appellant.\nA. A. McGillivray K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the carefully prepared opinion of my brother Mignault.\nHis statement of the material facts of the case as disclosed by the evidence before us is complete. There is no need to repeat it, or to comment upon it. The hot water bottle, which burned the plaintiff's leg, was found on the morning following the operation lying next to his skin and inside the blanket which was still tucked around his legs and feet and apparently had not been disturbed during the night. These circumstances exclude any suggestion that this admittedly wrong and dangerous position of the bottle might be accounted for by any movement, voluntary or involuntary, of the patient. They afford strong prima facie, if not conclusive, proof that the bottle had been placed as it was found either when the unconscious patient was wrapped in the blanket in the operating room or immediately afterwards when he was covered up in bed and that it had been allowed to remain there during the night. There is nothing to cast the slightest doubt on the correctness of these inferences of fact and the case must be disposed of on the assumption that they are correct.\nThe learned trial judge found that:\nThe proximate cause of this accident was, as I say, in the first place the filling of the bottle with water that was much too hot without any testing of it; then the failure to investigate and see if any adjustment was necessary.\nThe evidence fully justifies these findings and also the finding that the latter faults\u2014the failure to investigate\u2014 was attributable to the nurse Switzer. The sole question is whether for that neglect and its consequences the defendant is legally responsible. I fully agree with my learned brother's rejection of the respondent's claim to exemption from liability on the ground that it was \"a government agency\" or\na public body carrying on work not for profit but for the benefit of the residents of the district,\nand with his opinion of the inapplicability of the decision in The Sanitary Commissioners of Gibraltar v. Orfila et al[2]. As put by Farwell L.J., in Hillyer v. Governors of St. Bartholomew's Hospital [3] :\nIt is now settled that a public body is liable for the negligence of its servants in the same way as private individuals would be under similar circumstances, notwithstanding that it is acting in the performance of public duties, like a local board of health, or of eleemosynary and charitable functions, like a public hospital.\nI am also satisfied that the regulation no. 9 invoked by the defendant as relieving it from responsibility to the plaintiff is ineffectual for that purpose, both because as a regulation it transcends any power of regulation and management conferred by s. 49 of the statute (R.S.A. (1922) c. 116), and because such notice to the plaintiff of its existence as might, under some circumstances, make it an implied term of a contract between the defendant and a patient has not been shewn. The plaintiff entered the hospital for an operation without any special contract, but as a paying patient at the special rates to which, as a municipal ratepayer, he was entitled. Nothing else appears as to the footing on which he was received.\nI am, however, unable to accede to the view of my learned brother that the present action is concluded against the plaintiff by the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Hillyer v. Governors of St. Bartholomew's Hospital2. That case is authority for the propositions (a) that the relation of master and servant does not exist between a hospital board and the surgeons and physicians whom it may supply for the treatment of patients in the hospital; (b) that the nurses on the staff of the hospital while they are actually engaged in assisting a surgeon during an operation (in the Hillyer Case2 it was a physical examination under an anaesthetic) are so immediately subject to his orders and control that they are for the time being not to be regarded as servants of the hospital authority; and (c) that in regard to them while so engaged, as in regard to the surgeon himself whom they are assisting (should he also be supplied by the hospital management), the only undertaking of the hospital authority is that they are qualified for the duties assigned to them and not that they will not be negligent in their performance. But, as Farwell L.J., says, in the Hillyer Case[4], at p. 826,\nso long as they (the nurses) are bound to obey the orders of the defendants (the Board of Governors) it may well be that they are their servants;\nand as Kennedy L.J. says (in the same case), at p. 829:\nIt may be, and for my part I should, as at present advised, be prepared to hold, that the hospital authority is legally responsible to the patients for the due performance of (sic) the servants within the hospital of their purely ministerial or administrative duties, such as, for example, attendance of nurses in the wards, the summoning of medical aid in cases of emergency, the supply of proper food, and the like.\nIn Hillyer's Case4 the injuries complained of, so far as appeared, were in fact sustained during the physical examination. In the case at bar the burning of the plaintiff occurred after the operation had been completed and he had been removed from the operating room to the adjoining hall, then in actual use as a ward owing to the regular wards being crowded.\nThe Hillyer Case4 is not authority for non-responsibility of the hospital corporation for neglect by a nurse occurring after the patient has left the operating room and in regard to matters which fall within the scope of her ordinary duties, as admittedly does the heating of a patient's bed and the placing of hot water bottles in it to ward off danger from shock and chill. On the contrary, the learned judges in that case are careful to exclude from the application of their decision such duties of nurses as\ntheir attendance in the wards * * * the supplying of proper food, and the like.\nFor matters such as these\u2014for matters in regard to which\nthe management of a hospital ought to make and does make its own regulations * * * it is in my judgment (says Kennedy L.J., at p. 829), legally responsible to the patients for their sufficiency, their propriety, and observance of them by their servants.\nThe judgments in Hillyer's Case4 were carefully considered and their effect was, I think, correctly appreciated by the Ontario Appellate Division in Lavere v. Smith's Falls Public Hospital[5], and I am unable to distinguish, in principle, between the Ontario case and that now before us.\nIt was the admitted duty of the nurse to see that hot water bottles were safely placed in the patient's bed, not as a matter of special instruction for the occasion, but as a matter of routine duty under a \"standing order.\" It is common ground that an elementary rule of nursing required that the hot water bottles should have been placed outside the blanket and should not have been in contact with the patient's skin. That rule is of special importance when the patient is under the influence of an anaesthetic and its neglect is an unpardonable fault.\nAssuming, in favour of the defendants, that the placing of the hot water bottle which burned the plaintiff took place while he was still in the operating room and at a time when the nurse might be regarded as so much under the orders and control of the operating surgeon that negligence on her part would not entail responsibility of the hospital authority, the evidence clearly establishes that some time (one-half or three-quarters of an hour) after the plaintiff had been removed from the operating room to the ward (the hall) the nurse Switzer (then a \"circulating nurse\") noticed a marked reddening of the skin about his chest, where another hot water bottle had been placed. Both bottles had been filled at the same time, from the same source, and their temperature had not been tested. The nurse thus had distinct warning that the bottles were dangerously hot; it then became her immediate and imperative duty to make sure that the second bottle, which was concealed by the bed covering, was so placed that it could do no harm. That duty she admittely did not discharge. She attempts to excuse herself by stating that she had some casual assurance from Dr. York, the plaintiff's physician, who was standing by, that \"they (the hot water bottles) were now all right.\" Dr. York, who was examined at length, was not asked to corroborate or to deny this particular statement. He had, however, said, referring to this occasion, that he\ndidn't see the nurse because there was no nurse with the doctor (Sarvis) when I came down there.\nBut, assuming that some such observation was made to the nurse, that, I agree with the learned trial judge, would not suffice to excuse her failure, under the circumstances, to investigate personally the situation in regard to the hot water bottle under the bed covering and to assure herself, as was her admitted duty, that it was not so placed that it might burn the patient.\nDr. York also said that he left no instructions whatever with the nurse in regard to hot water bottles and he added on cross-examination, that it is always customary in all operations to have the bed warmed\u2014we never give any orders\u2014it is a standing order\u2014it is always done. Dr. Sarvis gave similar testimony.\nI regard the failure of the nurse, after the appearance of the skin on the patient's chest had aroused her suspicions, to make sure that the hot water bottle against his leg was not a source of danger, as inexcusable and as negligence in her capacity as a servant of the hospital corporation in a matter of ministerial ward duty, if not of mere routine, which entailed responsibility on that body for its consequences. The obligation undertaken by the hospital authority (apart from the operation itself and the services of surgeons and nurses in the operating room) was not merely to supply properly qualified nurses, but to nurse the plaintiff. Hull v. Lees[6]. It was negligence of their servant in the discharge of that contractual obligation that caused the severe injury of which the plaintiff complains.\nI would, for these reasons, allow this appeal with costs here and in the Appellate Division and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nThe amendment of the style of cause giving the defendant its correct name \"Provost Municipal Hospital District, No. 12\" should be made before the judgment issues.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, which reversed the judgment of the learned trial judge which held the plaintiff (now appellant) entitled to recover. Having considered fully the judgment of my brother Mignault J., I entirely agree with his reasoning and his conclusion that the appeal herein should be dismissed with costs. MIGNAULT J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant obtained a judgment against the respondent in the Supreme Court of Alberta for $5,182, damages resulting from a burn suffered by him after an operation for appendicitis in the defendant's hospital. This decision was reversed by the appellate divisional court, Mr. Justice Walsh dissenting, and the appellant now seeks to have the judgment of the trial court restored.\nLate in the night of April 8, 1924, the appellant was brought to this hospital by his family physician, Dr. W. O. York, to be operated for a ruptured appendix. The operation was performed by Dr. York's partner, Dr. Ewart Sarvis, assisted by Dr. York, the anaesthetic being administered by Dr. Knoll. The nurses in attendance, and they were duly qualified nurses, were the matron of the hospital, Mrs. Mary W. Taylor, and Miss Elizabeth Switzer, now Mrs. Hale. As a part of the treatment, and to combat the shock of the operation, the bed in which the appellant was to be placed after the operation required to be heated, and for that purpose two rubber hot water bottles, placed inside flannelette bags, were filled in the kitchen by Mrs. Taylor, the water, according to her statement, being \"quite hot.\" The appellant was removed from the operating table and put in the bed which was placed in the hall outside, The next morning, when he recovered consciousness, it was discovered that his left leg had been severely burned near the ankle by one of these hot water bottles.\nThe appellant alleges that he was received as a patient in the hospital by the respondent which undertook for reward to furnish him all necessary and proper hospital treatment, nursing and appliances, and that the application of the hot water bottle was carelessly and negligently made by the respondent, in that the bottle was at an excessively high temperature and its application was continued for an excessive length of time. He further states that the respondent was negligent in failing to supply him, While he was in the hospital, proper, careful and sufficient attention, nursing and care, but this last ground, irrespective of the application to the appellant of the hot water bottle, was not entertained by any of the judgments. In substance, the plea of the respondent is that the hot water bottle was applied by or under the direction of Doctors Sarvis and York, they being qualified medical practitioners employed by the appellant, that the treatment of the appellant was under the direction and supervision of these physicians, who were solely responsible for the results, and that the respondent fulfilled its obligations by furnishing the appellant with the services of duly qualified and certificated nurses and supplying the requisite apparatus.\nThe trial judge found the respondent liable for the appellant's injuries, holding that the heating of the bed was no more than the daily making of beds.\nThis judgment was reversed by the Appellate Divisional Court. Mr. Justice Hyndman, with whom the other judges, with the exception of Mr. Justice Walsh, agreed, expressed the opinion that the hospital was created and existed purely for governmental purposes, and that the board was not liable unless it had failed to discharge its statutory duty to employ competent and qualified nurses. He also considered that, independently of this ground, the action failed on the authority of the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Hillyer v. Governors of St. Bartholomew's Hospital[7], to Which further reference will be made.\nThe first ground of the judgment appealed from rests on the statute under which the respondent operated its hospital, The Municipal Hospitals Act, chapter 116 of the Revised Statutes of Alberta, 1922.\nThis statute authorizes the Minister of Health to divide the province into hospital districts upon petition of a contributing council or of twenty-five ratepayers and to fix the number of members of the hospital board for the district. These members are elected by the ratepayers at the next municipal election and they hold office for two years. Upon organization, the board prepares a hospital scheme, which is duly advertised, and submitted for ratification to a vote of the municipal voters. This scheme may be referred by the Minister, before its adoption, to the Board of Public Utility Commissioners. If two-thirds of those voting approve the scheme, it is held to be adopted. The statute provides for the levying of a tax to defray the necessary expenditure, called the hospital tax, which is in addition to all rates levied for municipal purposes, and all moneys so raised by a municipality in respect of the hospital tax are forwarded by it to the secretary-treasurer of the hospital district. The board is also authorized to borrow by debentures an amount equal to the capital expenditure involved. Upon the ratification of the scheme, the board of the hospital district becomes a body corporate, and at its first meeting chooses a name and a corporate seal. It is empowered to make such rules and regulations for the maintenance and management of its hospital as it deems fit, and in addition to the usual staff it; may employ one or more district nurses. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council may also make regulations not inconsistent with the Act covering inter alia the equipment, control and management of the hospital, and it is the duty of the Minister to see that every hospital is always in a high state of efficiency, failing which it is within his power to dismiss the members of the board and appoint an official administrator in their stead, who holds office until a new board is elected upon the order of the Minister at the next municipal election. The hospital is supported by means of the taxes imposed on the ratepayers and moneys paid by them or other persons other than hospital supporters for hospital treatment, the hospital supporters being entitled to a minimum rate calculated at an amount which equals, with the taxes paid by them, the amount fixed for persons who are not hospital supporters. There is no provision in this statute for the support of the hospital by means of the public funds of the province, save that the board of any hospital may make an agreement with the Government as to cost and methods of specially training any number of nurses so as to better fit them to become superintendents of the hospital district, by which agreement the Government may assume a proportion of such cost.\nI do not think that the provisions of this statute warrant the conclusion that the municipal hospital or the hospital board is a government agency not liable for the negligence of its servants. Nor can it be contended, in my opinion, that, as a public body carrying on work not for profit but for the benefit of the residents of the district, the board is free from such liability. Such a contention seems hopeless in view of the decision of the House of Lords in Mersey Docks and Harbour Board Trustees v. Gibbs and Penhallow[8]. The judgment of the Privy Council in Sanitary Commissioners of Gibraltar v. Orfila[9], relied on in the Appellate Divisional Court, does not support the claim of immunity of a board such as this respondent, for the only question there was whether the Sanitary Commissioners were liable for mere nonfeasance.\nI will therefore approach the consideration of this case upon the basis that this respondent comes within the general rule of liability of masters for the negligence of their servants within the scope of their employment. The whole question, to my mind, is whether the relation of master and servant existed between the respondent and the physicians and nurses who treated the appellant at the time of his operation and of the burn suffered by him. For it is clear, in the words of Baron Parke, in Quarman v. Burnett [10] that\nliability by virtue of the principle of relation of master and servant must cease where the relation itself ceases to exist.\nIn order to determine whether this relation existed at the time of the appellant's injuries, it now becomes necessary to refer in some detail to what took place during the operation, especially with regard to the application to the appellant of the hot water bottles. There were present at the operation the three physicians, Drs. Sarvis, York and Knoll, and the two nurses, Mrs. Taylor, who was what is called a circulating nurse, and Miss Switzer, who was the \"scrub nurse,\" that is to say she wore a sterilized gown and gloves and assisted the operating surgeon. The operation began about 12.30 a.m., and lasted an hour. When it was over, Dr. Sarvis and Mrs. Taylor went out into the hall to bring in the appellant's bed which had been already prepared, but they discovered that it was made up wrongly. There was on the bed a special frame, which was used in similar cases, but it was found that \"it was on wrong end to and the bed had to be remade.\" In remaking the bed Dr. Sarvis assisted Mrs. Taylor, and the bed clothes were thrown on the floor while the gatch frame was being properly set. It may be here mentioned that Mrs. Taylor had already placed the two hot water bottles in the bed, while the operation was going on. When Dr. Sarvis first noticed these bottles, they were on the floor of the hall with the bed clothes. The bed was remade, the covers being folded back, and the bed was pushed into the operating room by Dr. Sarvis and Mrs. Taylor. Dr. Sarvis\u2014and Mrs. Taylor says the same thing\u2014testifies that when the bed was brought in he saw the hot water bottles lying in the centre of the bed. Dr. Sarvis and Dr. Knoll, with the assistance of Miss Switzer, then proceeded to transfer the patient from the operating table to the bed, which had been placed alongside the table. While the bed was being prepared, Miss Switzer put a binder, a pneumonia jacket and a gown on the patient, and then covered him with a blanket wrapped close to his chin and extending entirely over his feet and down under his side where it was tucked in as much as it was possible to do. Thus dressed, and covered with the blanket from head to feet, the patient was carried from the operating table to the bed, the coverings of which were then lifted up from the foot of the bed and placed over him. The bed with the patient was afterwards wheeled into the hall where it remained the rest of the night, there being then no available room elsewhere. Dr. Sarvis states that the hot water bottles, which he had seen in the centre of the bed when it was being brought into the operating room, were either left there when the patient was moved over into the bed, or placed back there immediately afterwards while he and Dr. Knoll were present. No witness however can say that he or she put back the bottles in the bed after the patient was placed there. Their proper place was in the bed, but outside the blanket which had been tucked around the patient.\nAfter the patient's bed was moved into the hall, Dr. Sarvis assisted by Miss Switzer proceeded to administer to the patient what is known as an interstitial, that is to say a saline solution which had been prepared and heated by Mrs. Taylor. The interstitial was injected into the breasts of the patient on both sides from a needle attached to a tube, and its object, as well as the object of the heating of the bed, Dr. Sarvis says, is to combat the shock of the operation. This took about half an hour, for, after making the injection, Dr. Sarvis waited to see that the saline solution was fully absorbed by the patient, and while the interstitial was being administered, or near the close of this operation, Dr. York, who had gone upstairs to see a maternity patient, came down and stood by the bed.\nIt was a part of the nurse's duty to see to the hot water bottles, and Miss Switzer testifies that she went to see where they were. Dr. Sarvis was standing by the bed and she said to him: \"How about the bottles?\" Dr. Sarvis answered: \"They are all right, they have been on the floor long enough to cool off.\" She then considered that she was relieved from responsibility with regard to the hot water bottles. Dr. Sarvis was called in rebuttal and would not deny that this conversation took place, although he said he had no recollection of it.\nMiss Switzer further states that while Dr. York was standing near the bed, she noticed one of these bottles next to the patient's skin on the left side. The skin was getting red. She said to Dr. York: \"What about the bottles, this one is getting red,\" and he answered \"Now they are all right.\" She did not again bother about the bottles during the night, and apparently this one did no harm, for the patient's chest was not burnt. The next morning the only bottle she noticed was the one which burned the patient's leg; it was inside the blanket, and next to his skin.\nI have given as complete an account as possible of what took place during the operation and subsequent treatment of the appellant according to the statements of the physicians and nurses. Dr. Knoll, who administered the anaesthetic, was not called. The learned trial judge was satisfied that each and every one of the witnesses gave to the best of his or her ability the best recollection he or she had of the occurrences. Nevertheless all possible explanations of the accident were not investigated. For instance, none of the physicians were asked whether the patient could have moved his leg while under the anaesthetic, and thus bring it into contact with a properly placed hot water bottle. Nor do we know what length of time of contact with the bottle would have caused the burn. From the way the patient was wrapped up and covered with the blanket, it does not seem probable that the bottle was placed inside the blanket in the operating room when the patient was moved to the bed. Nevertheless it is clear on the evidence that the hot water bottle which caused the burn was put into the bed, we cannot say by whom, in the operating room and in the presence of the physicians, unless the two bottles remained in the centre of the bed where Dr. Sarvis saw them and the patient was placed on top of them, which is unlikely. The physicians were afraid that the patient might develop pneumonia, for he was in a chilly condition when he was brought to the hospital, and it was a necessary part of the treatment that his bed should be thoroughly warmed. The important fact for the decision of this case is that all this was done within the operating room, while the nurse in attendance was under the orders of the surgeon, and when she afterwards inquired as to the bottles, she was assured by both Dr. Sarvis and Dr. York that they were all right. This would naturally lead her to believe that she did not have to remove the bed clothes to see whether the bottles were properly placed.\nAfter full consideration, my opinion is that this case comes well within the ratio decidendi of Hillyer v. Governors of St. Bartholomew's Hospital[11]. The plaintiff there was admitted into the hospital for the purposes of an examination under anaesthetics by an eminent surgeon, Dr. Lockwood. While he was on the operating table and unconscious, one of his arms was bruised and the other burnt. His action claiming damages was dismissed and the judgment of the trial court was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nIn his reasons for judgment, Farwell L.J., said at page 825:\u2014\nThe first question then is, were any of the persons present at the examination servants of the defendants? It is, in my opinion, impossible to contend that Mr. Lockwood, the surgeon, or the acting assistant surgeon, or the acting house surgeon, or the administrator of the anaesthetics, or any of them, were servants in the proper sense of the word; they are all professional men, employed by the defendants to exercise their profession to the best of their abilities according to their own discretion; but in exercising it they are in no way under the orders or bound to obey the directions of the defendants. * * * The only duty undertaken by the defendants is to use due care and skill in selecting their medical staff. * * * The three nurses and the two carriers stand on a somewhat different footing, and I will assume that they are the servants of the defendants. But although they are such servants for general purposes, they are not so for the purposes of operations and examinations by the medical officers. If and so long as they are bound to obey the orders of the defendants, it may well be that they are their servants, but as soon as the door of the theatre or operating room has closed on them for the purposes of an operation (in which term I include examination by the surgeon), they cease to be under the orders of the defendants, and are at the disposal and under the sole orders of the operating surgeon until the whole operation has been completely finished; the surgeon is for the time being supreme, and the defendants cannot interfere or gainsay his orders. * * * The nurses and carriers, therefore, assisting at an operation cease for the time being to be the servants of the defendants, inasmuch as they take their orders from the operating surgeon alone, and not from the hospital authorities.\nCozens-Hardy M.R., agreed in the dismissal of the appeal for the reasons contained in the judgments of Farwell L.J., and Kennedy L.J. The latter said, p. 829:\nIn my view, the duty which the law implies in the relation of the hospital authority to a patient and the corresponding liability are limited. The governors of a public hospital, by their admission of the patient to enjoy in the hospital the gratuitous benefit of its care, do, I think, undertake that the patient whilst there shall be treated only by experts, whether surgeons, physicians or nurses, of whose professional competence the governors have taken reasonable care to assure themselves; and, further, that those experts shall have at their disposal, for the care and treatment of the patient, fit and proper apparatus and appliances. But I see no ground for holding it to be a right legal inference from the circumstances of the relation of hospital and patient that the hospital authority makes itself liable in damages, if members of its professional staff, of whose competence there is no question, act negligently towards the patient in some matter of professional care or skill, or neglect to use, or use negligently, in his treatment the apparatus or appliances which are at their disposal.\nIn the Hillyer Case[12], the patient was treated gratuitously. But although Kennedy L.J., referred to the gratuitous benefit of the hospital's care, I do not think, in regard to an action based on negligence, that the duty and corresponding liability of the governing board of a hospital differ according as a fee is or is not charged to the patient. In either case they cannot be held liable for the result of the treatment professionally administered to the patient by the physicians and the nurses placed under the orders of the physicians, provided of course that they have exercised proper care in the employment of the physicians and nurses. Here the appellant employed his own physician Dr. York, and the latter no doubt chose the surgeon, Dr. Sarvis, who was his partner. The nurses were properly qualified and certificated nurses, and their competence is in no wise questioned. The hot water bottles were placed in the bed in the operating room in presence of Dr. Sarvis and Dr. Knoll, the nurses then being subject to the orders of the physicians, and when the nurse in charge inquired as to the bottles, both Drs. Sarvis and York, she testifies, assured her that they were all right. In my opinion, if there was negligence in placing the hot water bottle, the person who committed the negligence was not at the time the servant of the hospital board.\nBut the appellant contends that he made a contract with the respondent for hospital treatment and nursing, and that the latter is liable for breach of this contract. The respondent paid the minimum rate of one dollar per day to which as a hospital supporter he was entitled, others than hospital supporters being charged four dollars and a half per day.\nThere was no express contract, and if an implied contract can be inferred, it would involve, in my opinion, no liability of the hospital board for what was done by the physicians acting in the discharge of their professional duties or by the nurses when placed under the orders of the physicians, both selected with due regard to their competence and capacity. I do not think the case need rest on the regulations of this hospital board, duly posted and published, by one of which the patient assumed all risk of injury through the acts of the employees of the hospital. The board, in my opinion, discharged any obligation imposed on it by law or by any implied contract resulting from the admission of a paying patient into the hospital. There is no room for liability in the circumstances.\nI have not failed to consider the Ontario case of Lavere v. Smith's Falls Public Hospital[13], strongly relied on by the appellant. There the patient, who entered the hospital under an express contract, had her heel burned by a hot brick placed' by a nurse in her bed for heating purposes after an operation. The circumstances of that case may have justified a judgment against the hospital, a point on which it is unnecessary to express any opinion, but the Ontario decision certainly cannot prevail against the rules laid down in the Hillyer Case (1), which, in my opinion, should be applied here.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] (1926) 22 Alta.

Arts. 1014, 1025 1550, 1966, 1970 C.C.\nOn (the 23rd of September, 1920, the respondent and the appellant\u2019s auteur, J. R. B., entered into an agreement, by which the respondent undertook to raise out of the water and salve certain logs known as \u201cdeadheads\u201d belonging to J. R. B., which might be found in a certain definite area on the Ottawa river. The respondent undertook to erect a sawmill at a place called Dow\u2019s Bay for the purpose of sawing the logs by him raised and salved. In order to carry out the undertaking the respondent required financial assistance and the appellant consented to lend it. The respondent performed his operations under the contract and the appellant continued to make advances. On the 8th of September, 1921, the amount advanced by the appellant reached the sum of $26,090 and, on that date, an agreement was entered into by which the respondent \u201chereby bargains, sells, conveys, assigns and makes over unto the (appellant) * * * the following property.\u201d The concluding clause of the agreement was as follows: \u201cThe present bargain and sale is so made for and in consideration of the price and sum of $26,090 in hand paid by the (appellant) * * *.\u201d On the same date the appellant wrote a letter to the respondent as follows:\n\u201cUpon payment by you to the J.

Aylen K.C. and J. A. Aylen for the appellant.\nJ. N. Beauchamp for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014The appellant\u2019s contention is that the agreement of September 8, 1921, while made in the form of a sale, was only intended by the parties to operate as a transfer by way of security for the advances made by the appellant to the respondent in the carrying out of the contract, and which advances at that date, the appellant alleges, amounted to about $26,090, the price for which the sale was made.\nBut if we assume that that was the intention of the parties, there could have been no valid pledge of the movables, without giving possession to the appellant or to a third party agreed upon (arts. 1966, 1970 C.C.). This was not done and the respondent retained possession of the movables which he used in carrying out the contract. So that if the parties intended what the appellant says they intended, the whole contract was void.\nIf, on the contrary, they intended to make a sale of the movables to the appellant, coupled with a promise to re-convey them to the respondent (which is the effect of what is called the counter-letter), then possession could remain with the respondent and the sale would nevertheless be perfect (art. 1025 C.C.).\nConstruing therefore the contract according to the rule of art. 1014 C.C., that is to say so that it may have some effect rather than none at all, magis ut valeat quam ut pereat, it must be held to have been a sale with right of redemption. To such a sale the decision of this court in Salvas v. Vassal[2] fully applies, and the respondent not having exercised the right to redeem, the appellant remained absolute owner of the movables (art. 1550 C.C.). The obvious consequence is that it cannot now set up the amount of its advances for which the sale was made, in answer to the respondent\u2019s action.\nWhile, at first blush, the word \u201cindebtedness\u201d in the counter-letter presents some difficulty, it is more apparent than real. The sale extinguished the indebtednes theretofore subsisting. But when we remember that the sale and the promise to reconvey really formed but one transaction, the indebtedness referred to in the counter-letter so called must be that which formed the consideration for the sale, and only ceased to exist upon its becoming effective.\nMoreover, it is abundantly clear from the record before us that the dominant purpose of the parties in the making of the deed in question was to protect the property covered by it against the pressing claims of the respondent\u2019s other creditors. Both appellant and respondent were ready to give the transaction whatever form was best adapted to ensure that result, The appellant wals prepared to accept the transfer without restriction or qualification; the counter-letter was given at the instance of the respondent. Both parties may have expected that the respondent would exercise the droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 and that the transfer of the property would thus operate as a security. But they must be taken to have known the legal effect of the transaction as it was carried out and must be assumed to have intended that effect. J. R. Booth Ltd. took the transfer in the only form in which it could be effective (if at all) to prevent McLean\u2019s other creditors from seizing the property transferred; it took, in order to secure that benefit, a deed the legal effect of which was to extinguish the indebtedness in consideration of which it was given. Having taken the chance of McLean\u2019s failing to redeem within the period stipulated, it cannot now be allowed to set up that the transfer\u2014absolute in form\u2014was meant to operate merely as a pledge\u2014as such invalids\u2014and that the indebtedness, the extinction of which was the consideration for which such transfer ex facie purports to be made, still subsists and is available by way of set-off or counter-claim against the plaintiff\u2019s demand.\nAs to the amount of the respondent\u2019s recovery, the two courts are in agreement, and I would not disturb their finding on this point.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Duff and Newcombe JJ. (dissenting) was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014In September, 1920, the respondent entered into an agreement with J. R. Booth, the predecessor of the appellant, by which the respondent undertook to take a quantity of logs from the water in a certain part of the Ottawa river, to erect a sawmill at a place called Dow\u2019s Bay, and there to saw into lumber the logs salved by him under the contract. Shortly afterwards, the respondent applied to Booth for financial assistance to enable him to execute his contract, and received an advance of $5,000, which was secured by an assignment by one Lusk of a portable sawmill, together with some horses, wagons and other movables; an assignment which, it may be observed though absolute in form, was admittedly given as security only. The respondent proceeded with the execution of his contract, and in December, 1920, he acknowledged, by letter, that the steam mill he was then engaged in building, pursuant to the contract, and its appurtenances, were to be held by Booth as security for advances. Further advances having been made in the early part of 1921, on the 1st of April of that year the respondent, in an informal document, declared that certain specified property, comprising the sawmill and machinery and other articles connected with it, as well as horses, wagons, sleighs and other movables (including those which had been previously transferred by Lusk), were held by Booth as security for advances.\nIn the summer of 1921, the respondent obtained still further advances, and on the 8th of September, 1921, two additional documents were executed; and the crucial question on this appeal concerns the effect of these documents. The respondent\u2019s interpretation of them is this: There was a sale, he says, or, rather, a giving of property (comprised in a transfer from the respondent to the appellant) in payment of the respondent\u2019s indebtedness, to the amount of the consideration mentioned in the transfer, with a right of repurchase by the respondent for the same amount declared in a contre-lettre attached to the transfer. The appellant, on the other hand, avers, in substance, that there was merely a formal transfer to the appellant as security of property which, by existing arrangements informally expressed, was already held by him as security. Parol evidence was offered as to declarations of the parties touching the understanding between them, and rejected. There appear, however, to be good grounds, quite apart from this extrinsic evidence, for holding that the appellant\u2019s version of the transaction is the right one. The contre-lettre is in these words:\nOttawa, 8th Sept., 1921.\nMr. Walter K. McLean,\nBreckenridge.\nDear Sir,\u2014Upon payment by you to the J. R. Booth Limited of the amount of your indebtedness to it, the company will re-assign and make over to you the property assigned this day by you to it, provided the contract between you and the company is still in force.\nYours truly,\n(Sgd.) J. R. BOOTH LIMITED,\nPer John Black,\nSecretary.\nAnd the material part of the transfer is as follows:\nThe present bargain and sale is so made for and in consideration of the price and sum of twenty-six thousand and ninety dollars ($26,090). in hand paid by the party of the second part to the party of the first part, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged which said sum of money has been used by the party of the first part for the\u2019 purchase, acquisition and construction of the foregoing property.\nWhen the whole of the facts in evidence are considered, those anterior to these documents of the 8th September, as well as those subsequent, the fair interpretation of them seems to be that accepted by Mr. Justice Dorion, upon whose dissenting judgment the appellant largely relies.\nThe critical point is: Did the parties intend a pro tanto payment and extinguishment of the respondent\u2019s debt to the appellant?\nFirst it should be observed that the consideration for the transfer is in that document expressed in language which is far from apt to describe a consideration which consists merely in the satisfaction of a debt. The instrument records a bargain and sale, but a bargain and sale in consideration of moneys paid by the appellant which had previously been expended by the respondent in acquiring and constructing the property transferred. This does not suggest the extinction of a debt, as the true consideration. Indeed, the statement of the consideration itself is strictly consistent with the idea of a transfer\u2014a \u201cbargain and sale\u201d \u2014made in consideration of moneys \u201cpaid\u201d by way of loan; and this is, in substance, the form of words (\u201cin consideration of advances\u201d) used in one at least of the earlier documents, when admittedly the transfer was intended to be by way of security only. Then, when we come to the contre-lettre, we find it expressed in terms which could hardly have been employed by parties intending by these documents to effect the extinguishment of any part of the respondent\u2019s debt. The respondent himself deposed that the sum mentioned in the transfer as the consideration for it was arrived at by ascertaining the value of the property transferred, and in his factum he points out that this sum was considerably less than the amount that had been advanced in cash prior to the 8th of September. It is difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with this the contention that \u201cindebtedness\u201d in the contre-lettre means the sum mentioned in the transfer. Moreover, after the date of the transfer advances were made to a considerable amount, and it is impossible to suppose that this was not in contemplation when these documents were drawn up. Having regard to these considerations, the better view seems to be that the proper construction of the contre-lettre is that which ascribes to the word \u201cindebtedness\u201d its natural and ordinary meaning, and that the parties intended a retransfer upon payment by the respondent of the amount owing by him, whatever it might be at the time of payment; in other words, that the property was to be held as security for that indebtedness.\nThen it must toe remembered that the respondent retained possession of the property for some time after the execution of the documents, treating it as his own, and employing it as he had always done, in manufacturing lumber from the appellant\u2019s logs.\nAll these considerations, taken collectively, seem to afford a satisfactory ground for the conclusion reached by Mr. Justice Dorion in the court below.\nIn this view it is unnecessary to examine the question so much discussed in the courts below, whether the evidence offered by the appellant and rejected by the trial judge, of contemporaneous oral declarations by the parties as to their intention in executing the documents, was properly rejected as being excluded by art. 1234 of the Civil Code. That article is derived from the law of England; but we are not now concerned with any question as to the propriety of consulting the established principles of that law, governing the interpretation and application of the rule embodied in the article. Nevertheless (learned judges in the court below, the majority of whom considered the evidence inadmissible, having intimated views as to the pertinent rule of English law) it is perhaps desirable to say this: Had such a question arisen in a similar case before a tribunal administering law according to the principles of the law of England, there never could have been a doubt concerning the disposition of it. As a rule, where a debtor transfers property to his creditor, by a conveyance absolute in form, and a question arises whether or not the debt has been extinguished, parol evidence is technically admissible to shew that the conveyance, notwithstanding its absolute form was intended to take effect as a security only. The practice of the courts in dealing with such questions is admirably illustrated by the judgment of Lord Watson, speaking for the Judicial Committee, in Barton v. The Bank of New South Wales (1).\nIt follows from this view that the respondent\u2019s action should be dismissed. It results also that the appellant is entitled to recover the amount of his cross demand, $24,010.42. The appellant should have his costs of the action and of the cross demand, as well as those of both appeals.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Aylen & Aylen.\nSolicitors for the respondent: J.

The tax imposed by The Mine Owners Tax Act, 1923, Alta.

L.R. 245) reversed.\nAPPEAL by the defendant company from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1] affirming (Clarke J.A. dissenting) the judgment of Simmons C.J.[2] in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe action was brought to recover from the defendant, under The Mine Owners Tax Act, 1923, Alta. (c. 33), and an Order in Council of 14th August, 1925, a tax of 2 per cent. of the gross revenue received by the defendant from its mine. The defendant alleged that the tax imposed was an indirect tax and therefore ultra vires of the province, under The B.N.A. Act.\nS. 3 of The Mine Owners Tax Act, 1923, provides that every mine owner shall from the last day of May, 1918, be subject to a tax upon the gross revenue received by him from his mine. S. 4 provides that the tax shall not be more than 2 per cent. of the said revenue and as determined by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council under the provisions of the Act. By s. 2 \"mine\" is, in effect, defined as a coal mine, and \"mine owner\" is, in effect, defined as the immediate proprietor, lessee, licensee or occupier of any mine, as distinguished from an owner not actually operating the mine.\nThe Order in Council fixed the rate at 2 per cent.\nH. S. Patterson for the appellant.\nJ. J. Frawley for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014It is not disputed that, as a rule, the \"gross revenue\" upon which the impeached tax is levied is merely the aggregate of sums received from sales of coal. In substance, the tax does not differ from a tax levied upon every sum received from the sale of coal. In the ordinary course there could be no doubt that allowance would be made for it in the price charged, and that it would, almost in its entirety, be borne by the purchasers of coal. To label the tax as an income tax does not affect the substance of the matter. We are constrained by a long series of well known decisions to hold that the legislation is ultra vires.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 22 Alta.

Prosko v. The King (63 Can. S.C.R. 226) referred to.\nAPPEAL by the Attorney General of the province of British Columbia from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for the said province[1] setting aside the conviction of, and granting a new trial to, the respondent who had been convicted, on trial before Murphy J. and a jury, of committing an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The ground upon which the Court of Appeal proceeded was that of error in wrongfully admitting evidence.\nThe evidence of which wrongful admission was claimed was that of a constable of the municipal police of the said province, who arrested the respondent, and who was called at the trial as a witness for the Crown. He testified that on making the arrest he cautioned the respondent and told him that he (the respondent) was not bound to say anything, but that if he did say anything it might be used in evidence against him; the respondent made a statement that he was in bed since twelve o'clock and that he had not been out since twelve o'clock that night; the constable called the attention of the respondent to the condition of the respondent's hat, and the respondent said he had not worn that hat the night the offence was committed, but that he had worn another; the constable also at the same time called the respondent's attention to a scrape on respondent's arm; the constable in his evidence said as to this\n*** There was a scrape on his arm here about one-half inch wide and I would say about two or three inches long as if it had been pushed against something. Q. Was it recent?\u2014A. Yes. I drew his attention to it and he said that was an old mark, that it had been there a long time, but as a matter of fact it was fresh. It was wet, and there was blood oozing through; it was not cut far enough to let the blood come freely but it was a fresh bruise.\nThe judgments of the Court of Appeal were delivered orally. In his judgment Macdonald C.J.A. said:\nI found my judgment entirely upon the wrongful admission of the evidence which appears at page 99 in the appeal book, where it appears that while the police sergeant said that he warned this man at the time of his arrest yet it further appears that later on, apparently, he called the accused's attention to his hat and to the condition it was in, eliciting a statement with regard to it, but the most serious thing of all was his calling attention to a mark or wound in accused's arm. He says this, \"there was a scrape on his arm here about one-half an inch wide and I would say about two or three inches long, as if it had been pushed against something.\" The accused, according to the Crown's case, had been in a fracas in the rooming house and naturally one would look for wounds and the sergeant did look for wounds and found this \"scrape on his arm.\" And then he says, \"Yes, I drew his attention to it and he said it was an old mark that had been there a long time but as a matter of fact it was fresh.\" What was the probable effect of that? It was practically intimating to the jury that the man had told a direct falsehood to him when he had questioned him at the time of his arrest. That would affect the prisoner's testimony in the witness box, it would affect the credence to be attached to it and it might very well have influenced the jury in finding the verdict which they did find. Therefore, in my opinion, there was a substantial wrong which amounts to a miscarriage of justice and the conviction must be set aside and a new trial ordered.\nMartin J.A. agreed upon the ground that what the constable did at the time of the arrest amounted to improper extraction of information, by questions, from the accused, which tended to destroy his defence, which was an alibi. Galliher, McPhillips and Macdonald J.J.A. agreed that there should be a new trial.\nApplication was made for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, on the ground that the judgment of the Court of Appeal conflicted with the judgments of other courts of appeal in like cases. Leave to appeal was granted by Newcombe J. under s. 1024A of the Criminal Code.\nJ. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellant.\nNo one appeared for the respondent.\nWithout hearing argument by Mr. Ritchie, the Chief Justice orally delivered the judgment of the court as follows:\n\"We have all had an opportunity of considering this case, and we are satisfied that the order appealed from is wrong. The evidence in question was properly received at the trial. The matter was fully considered here in Prosko v. The King (1). The Crown discharged its burden of establishing the voluntary character of the statements made by the accused who had been given the customary warning. The mere asking of a question by the officer subsequently, or his directing the accused's attention to the subject of one of such statements, did not amount to an inducement or persuasion such as would render the statements inadmissible. The appeal is allowed and the conviction is reinstated.\"\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. D. Carter.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H. Castillon.\n[1] [1927] 1 W. W. R. 471.\n",

Quelques-uns y sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9s par leurs noms et. entre autres, le lac Guindon. L\u2019acte poursuit:\ntous les lacs ci-dessus avec droits de chasse et p\u00eache, pouvoirs d\u2019eau, etc., s\u2019y trouvant et non encore vendus; mais ce, sans autre garantie que celle de leurs faits et promesses, ainsi que le tout se trouve pr\u00e9sentement avec les servitudes actives et passives, apparentes ou occultes, attach\u00e9es auxdits immeubles. * * * L\u2019acqu\u00e9reur, se d\u00e9clarant satisfait des titres fournis par la venderesse, s\u2019engage \u00e0 ne jamais exiger plus de garantie \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des lacs et terrains vendus que n\u2019en a re\u00e7ue ladite venderesse des h\u00e9ritiers de feu C. A. M. Globensky et il promet ne jamais troubler ladite venderesse ainsi que lesdits h\u00e9ritiers de feu C. A. M. Globensky relativement aux titres de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 desdits lacs et desdits, terrains et du tout susvendu. De plus l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur s\u2019engage de soutenir \u00e0 ses frais et d\u00e9pens toutes proc\u00e9dures ou contestations que des tiers pourraient soulever concernant le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ce que pr\u00e9sentement vendu.\nNaturellement, l\u2019appelante a produit, en outre, la suite des titres de ses auteurs, mais c\u2019est uniquement dans son contrat \u00e0 elle qu\u2019il faut chercher les droits qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 c\u00e9d\u00e9s. Elle a donc acquis le lac Guindon (N.B. Il n\u2019appara\u00eet nulle part qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve des \u201c\u00eeles et \u00eelets\u201d ou des \u201cpouvoirs d\u2019eau\u201d) avec droits de chasse et de p\u00eache. Cela veut dire: le lac \u00e0 son niveau ordinaire (art. 422 C.C.). L\u2019appelante n\u2019a, en vertu de son titre, acquis aucun terrain autour du lac Guindon, ni droit de gr\u00e8ve, ni droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s.\nUn lac non navigable et non flottable comme celui-ci, seul et consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme entit\u00e9 distincte de ses rives, peut faire partie du domaine priv\u00e9 d\u2019un particulier; il peut \u00eatre l\u2019objet d\u2019un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ind\u00e9pendant des terrains qui l\u2019environnent; mais cela n\u2019emporte pas par le fait m\u00eame la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou l\u2019usage des gr\u00e8ves, non plus que le droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s. M\u00eame si le propri\u00e9taire peut se pr\u00e9valoir de la servitude r\u00e9sultant de l\u2019enclave, il ne pourra exiger un passage qu\u2019\u00e0 \u201cla charge d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 proportionn\u00e9e au dommage qu\u2019il peut causer\u201d (art. 540 C.C.). C\u2019est dire que l\u2019appelante ne peut, en vertu d\u2019un contrat qui la d\u00e9clare propri\u00e9taire du seul lac Guindon, nier aux riverains le droit de gr\u00e8ve ou le droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s. C\u2019est plut\u00f4t la proposition contraire qui serait vraie.\nCe contrat, cependant, dans ses termes, lui conf\u00e8re la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du lac. Il lui accorde, en plus, express\u00e9ment les droits de chasse et de p\u00eache. Cette mention sp\u00e9ciale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire. Le droit de chasse, le droit de p\u00eache et le droit de canotage sont des attributs de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 (Picard, Trait\u00e9 des Eaux, vol. 4, p. 205; Fraser v. Fraser[2]. Le Conseil Priv\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le droit de p\u00eache pouvait faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une concession s\u00e9par\u00e9e (\u201ca separate physical subject of possession\u201d). Matamajaw Salmon Club v. Ducha\u00eene[3]. Mais le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, en dehors des lois sp\u00e9ciales ou des conventions distinctes, veut que tous ces droits (p\u00eache, chasse, canotage) appartiennent \u00e0 celui qui a la jouissance du domaine: terre, lac ou cours d\u2019eau.\nL\u2019acte que lui a consenti Dame Elizabeth Globensky justifierait donc l\u2019appelante de r\u00e9clamer des droits exclusifs de chasse, de p\u00eache et de canotage sur le lac Guindon si, au moment de la convention, ces droits \u00e9taient, suivant le langage m\u00eame de l\u2019acte, \u201cnon encore vendus\u201d.\nOr, le 21 novembre 1848, Dame Marie Elmire Lambert Dumont (Madame Pierre Laviolette), seigneuresse de la Seigneurie de l\u2019Augmentation des Mille-Isles, a conc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de cens et rentes fonciers \u00e0 Martin Paquette, cultivateur de Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi d\u00e9crite:\u2014\nUne terre situ\u00e9e au nord-ouest de la rivi\u00e8re du Nord, en ladite seigneurie de l\u2019Augmentation des Mille-Iles, en la susdite paroisse de Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, de forme irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re, enclav\u00e9e dans la largeur de six terres ladite rivi\u00e8re du Nord. Savoir par les no\u2014quarante-six quarante-sept quarante-huit quarante-neuf cinquante cinquante et un o\u00f9 elle tient par devant et par derri\u00e8re au cordon de compensation qui s\u00e9pare le surplus de terrain compris entre ledit cordon le lac Bisson et les six terres ci-haut mentionn\u00e9es d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 au nord, tenant dix arpents et neuf perches \u00e0 n\u00b0 52 et de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 environ trois arpents au flanc lac Germain, mais il faut comprendre que la plus grande partie du lac Bisson s\u2019\u00e9tend sur le terrain.\nCette dite terre contient une superficie de cent arpente plus ou moins, conform\u00e9ment au proc\u00e8s-verbal de bornage d\u2019icelle par Mtre Emery F\u00e9r\u00e9, arpenteur jur\u00e9, en date du trois avril dernier \u00e0 l\u2019instant remis au preneur.\nLe proc\u00e8s-verbal de bornage de M. F\u00e9r\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 requis par Dame Marie Elmire Lambert Dumont, par le tuteur de Demoiselle Virginie Lambert Dumont et par Martin Paquette \u201caux fins de mesurer et borner\u201d la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de conc\u00e9der. La d\u00e9signation ins\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019acte est en termes identiques \u00e0 ceux du proc\u00e8s-verbal, sauf que la ponctuation la rend plus claire:\u2014\nune concession de forme irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re, enclav\u00e9e dans la largeur de six terres de la rivi\u00e8re du Nord savoir: par les nos 46 47, 48, 49, 50 et 51 o\u00f9 elle tient par devant, par derri\u00e8re au cordon de compensation qui s\u00e9pare le surplus de terrain compris entre ledit cordon, le lac Bisson et les six terres mentionn\u00e9es, d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 au nord tenant dix arpents et neuf perches au n\u00b0 52 et de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 environ trois arpents au flanc du lac Germain, mais il faut comprendre que la plus grande partie du lac Bisson s\u2019\u00e9tend sur le terrain. Or, ladite concession ainsi d\u00e9sign\u00e9e forme par les lignes qui fixent son contour \u00e0 part de l\u2019entr\u00e9e du lac Bisson sur le terrain une superficie de cent arpents plus ou moins.\nLa description de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans l\u2019acte comme \u00e9tant \u201cune terre\u201d n\u2019a pas pour effet d\u2019\u00e9liminer le lac Bisson. Le mot \u201cterre\u201d n\u2019est pas employ\u00e9 ici par opposition au mot \u201ceaux\u201d. Il n\u2019a pas pour but d\u2019exclure les eaux. Il veut dire \u201cconcession\u201d, et c\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs le terme dont se sert \u00e0 deux r\u00e9prises le proc\u00e8s-verbal. L\u2019acte lui donne ce m\u00eame sens un peu plus bas dans la description lorsqu\u2019il r\u00e9f\u00e8re aux \u201csix terres de ladite rivi\u00e8re du Nord\u201d. Encore \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque actuelle, dans le langage usuel de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, on parle d\u2019un lot ou d\u2019une ferme comme \u00e9tant une terre.\nCela n\u2019emp\u00eache pas (comme le dit M. le juge Dorion) qu\u2019un lac de peu d\u2019\u00e9tendue peut parfaitement \u00eatre compris dans les bornes d\u2019un lot et en former partie sans m\u00eame qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire de le mentionner express\u00e9ment.\nC\u2019est l\u00e0 d\u2019ailleurs ce qui s\u2019est produit pour la concession primordiale du fief lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 M. Dumont. Ce document ne contient aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux lacs, aux rivi\u00e8res ou aux cours d\u2019eau. Il r\u00e9sulte cependant de la r\u00e9ponse de la Cour Seigneuriale \u00e0 la vingt-huiti\u00e8me question que celles de ces eaux qui \u00e9taient non navigables ni flottables et qui traversaient le fief ou qui s\u2019y trouvaient totalement ou partiellement situ\u00e9es \u201cappartenaient au fief et en faisaient partie\u201d \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elles ne fussent exclues par le titre. Par l\u2019accensement, le censitaire devenait de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re propri\u00e9taire des eaux non navigables ni flottables qui se trouvaient dans sa concession et il acqu\u00e9rait \u201cla possession et les profits de ces eaux dans les limites de cette concession\u201d (Cour Seigneuriale, R\u00e9ponses aux questions 29 et 32, Lower Canada Reports, vol. A, pp. 72a et 74a).\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue \u00e0 Martin Paquette, m\u00eame sous la d\u00e9signation \u201cune terre\u201d, comprenait donc les eaux non navigables ni flottables \u201cqui s\u2019y trouvaient totalement ou partiellement situ\u00e9es\u201d \u00e0 moins d\u2019exclusion dans le titre.\nOr, l\u2019arpenteur, dans son proc\u00e8s-verbal, et les parties, dans l\u2019acte de vente, ont donn\u00e9 les lignes qui fixent le contour de la concession; elle est enclav\u00e9e entre les six terres de la rivi\u00e8re du Nord portant les num\u00e9ros 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 et 51, \u201co\u00f9 elle tient par devant\u201d, le cordon de compensation qui la borne par derri\u00e8re, le num\u00e9ro 52 qui la limite au nord et le flanc du lac Germain qui la borne de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9. La description ne mentionne le lac Bisson qu\u2019en rapport avec le surplus de terrain qui aboutit au cordon de compensation. Elle ne r\u00e9f\u00e8re pas au lac Bisson pour d\u00e9limiter la concession. Elle dit, au contraire, \u201cque la plus grande partie du lac Bisson s\u2019\u00e9tend sur le terrain\u201d.\nComme le fait remarquer M. le juge Dorion en Cour du Banc du Roi:\u2014\nLa concession comprend donc une partie du lac Guindon, puisque la plus grande partie de ce lac s\u2019\u00e9tend sur le terrain. Mais l\u2019acte dit que la terre conc\u00e9d\u00e9e contient cent arpents conform\u00e9ment au proc\u00e8s-verbal, et le proc\u00e8s-verbal dit quelle forme cette superficie de cent arpents \u00e0 part de l\u2019entr\u00e9e du lac sur le terrain. Le lac est donc exclu de la mesure des cent arpents qui sont conc\u00e9d\u00e9s, mais il n\u2019est pas exclu du terrain conc\u00e9d\u00e9 * * * il y est express\u00e9ment compris puisqu\u2019il s\u2019y \u00e9tend.\nCependant, pour les fins de ce litige, ce qu\u2019il faut surtout remarquer, c\u2019est que le proc\u00e8s-verbal et l\u2019acte d\u00e9clarent tous deux que la terre ou concession \u00e0 Martin Paquette \u201ctient pardevant\u201d \u00e0 des lots de terre de la rivi\u00e8re du Nord qui avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 conc\u00e9d\u00e9s par le seigneur et qui sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9s sous les num\u00e9ros 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 et 51. Or, l\u2019appelante a vers\u00e9 au dossier le .\nplan de la nouvelle concession dans la partie de l\u2019augmentation de la seigneurie des Mille-Isles appartenant aux h\u00e9ritiers Dumont,\nsign\u00e9 par M. Godfroi Laviolette. Si l\u2019on examine ce plan, l\u2019on voit que le lac Bisson est compl\u00e8tement encercl\u00e9 par le terrain de la concession faite \u00e0 Martin Paquette et celui des lots num\u00e9ros 47, 48 et 49. Une partie des num\u00e9ros 47 et 49 se rend jusqu\u2019au terrain de la concession Paquette; mais le num\u00e9ro 48 ne s\u2019y rend pas. Le lac s\u00e9pare tout le terrain du num\u00e9ro 48 du terrain de la concession faite \u00e0 Paquette.\nCependant le proc\u00e8s-verbal et l\u2019acte disent que la concession Paquette \u201ctient pardevant\u201d entre autres aux num\u00e9ros 47, 48 et 49. Elle s\u2019\u00e9tend jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la ligne de ces num\u00e9ros; aucun territoire interm\u00e9diaire n\u2019est retenu par la seigneurie. Il est donc impossible de donner effet \u00e0 cette description sans comprendre tout le lac Bisson dans la concession \u00e0 Paquette et les autres concessions ant\u00e9rieures des lots num\u00e9ros 47, 48 et 49.\nLa description pourrait laisser entendre que le lac Bisson tout entier est compris dans la concession Paquette (puisque cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019\u00e9tend jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la ligne des terres d\u00e9j\u00e0 conc\u00e9d\u00e9es et qui portent les num\u00e9ros 47, 48 et 49), si le proc\u00e8s-verbal et l\u2019acte ne disaient pas que le lac Bisson ne s\u2019\u00e9tend qu\u2019en partie (\u201cla plus grande partie\u201d) sur le terrain. Il r\u00e9sulte de cette indication que les lignes de division de la concession Paquette d\u2019une part et des num\u00e9ros 47, 48 et 49 d\u2019autre part doivent se rencontrer sous le lac Bisson ou Guindon. Entre la terre vendue \u00e0 Paquette et les terres de la rivi\u00e8re du Nord qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9signation tant dans le proc\u00e8s-verbal que dans l\u2019acte, se rejoignent, il ne subsiste aucun territoire r\u00e9siduaire pour la seigneuresse; or, si le territoire dont il s\u2019agit avait \u00e9t\u00e9 alors conc\u00e9d\u00e9, il s\u2019ensuit que les droits qui sont les attributs de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement.\nOn peut donc conclure que, d\u00e8s le 21 novembre 1848, le lac Bisson ou Guindon, ainsi que les droits de chasse, de p\u00eache et de canotage sur ce lac, \u00e9taient sortis du domaine utile des seigneurs de l\u2019Augmentation des Mille-Isles, et que, par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appelante, qui pr\u00e9tend tenir son titre des h\u00e9ritiers descendants de ces seigneurs, n\u2019a pu acqu\u00e9rir valablement ni le lac Guindon, ni les droits qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clame sur ce lac. Martin Paquette et les propri\u00e9taires des terres 47, 48 et 49 d\u00e9tiennent du m\u00eame auteur par concession ant\u00e9rieure, et la question de priorit\u00e9 d\u2019enregistrement ne se pose m\u00eame pas (arts. 1027 et 2098 C.C.).\nC\u2019est bien ainsi d\u2019ailleurs que, en 1848, et dans les ann\u00e9es qui suivirent, les parties ont compris leurs titres. On a l\u2019habitude de dire, et il est de jurisprudence, que la fa\u00e7on dont les parties ex\u00e9cutent elles-m\u00eames les obligations d\u2019un acte est l\u2019un des moyens les plus s\u00fbrs d\u2019en saisir la port\u00e9e et l\u2019intention. Toute la preuve d\u00e9montre qu\u2019apr\u00e8s la concession faite \u00e0 Martin Paquette, ce dernier et ses successeurs ont eu, sans \u00eatre molest\u00e9s par les seigneurs ou par qui que ce soit, la jouissance sur le lac Guindon de tous les droits que rappelante entendait leur nier par les proc\u00e9dures qu\u2019elle a intent\u00e9es.\nL\u2019objection soulev\u00e9e contre la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019acte de vente \u00e0 Martin Paquette nous para\u00eet avoir trouv\u00e9 sa juste solution dans le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nLe testament de Louis-Eustache-Lambert Dumont, en date du 11 octobre 1805, l\u00e9guait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de sa seigneurie aux petits-enfants de ses enfants mineurs, Nicolas-Eustache-Lambert Dumont et Marie-Louise-Ang\u00e9lique-Lambert Dumont. Il d\u00e9fendait \u00e0 ses l\u00e9gataires de vendre, engager, ni ali\u00e9ner aucune partie de sa seigneurie. Ses enfants et ses petits-enfants ne devaient avoir que la jouissance de leurs parts et portions h\u00e9r\u00e9ditaires, avec substitution en faveur des arri\u00e8res petits-enfants.\nA la date de la concession Paquette, la seigneurie \u00e9tait en la possession de Marie-Elmire-Lambert Dumont (Madame Laviolette) et Virginie Lambert Dumont, alors mineure, \u00e9tait appel\u00e9e au deuxi\u00e8me degr\u00e9 comme arri\u00e8re petite-fille de Louis-Eustache-Lambert Dumont.\nLe tuteur de cette derni\u00e8re est mentionn\u00e9 par l\u2019arpenteur F\u00e9r\u00e9 dans son proc\u00e8s-verbal comme ayant particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9quisition du bornage.\nLa d\u00e9fense d\u2019ali\u00e9ner et la substitution cr\u00e9\u00e9e par le testament peuvent s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter comme s\u2019appliquant seulement au domaine direct de la seigneurie, abstraction faite du domaine utile. Mais si elle avait pour but d\u2019emp\u00eacher les successeurs et h\u00e9ritiers de Louis-Eustache-Lambert Dumont de faire des concessions du domaine utile \u201cquand de ce requis\u201d cette prohibition eut \u00e9t\u00e9 alors ill\u00e9gale et consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme non \u00e9crite (art. 760 C.C.).\nLa concession des terres en fiefs et seigneurie au Canada a, par l\u2019arr\u00eat du 6 juillet 1711,\nrendu obligatoire pour les seigneurs la concession de ces terres \u00e0 des habitants pour les mettre en culture. Les anciennes lois de pays, ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la cession \u00e0 la Grande-Bretagne, imposaient aux propri\u00e9taires de fiefs et seigneuries l\u2019obligation de conc\u00e9der leurs terres \u00e0 titre de redevances, quand ils en \u00e9taient requis, et cette obligation limitait l\u2019exercice de leurs droits dans la disposition de ces terres.\nC\u2019est l\u00e0 le texte des r\u00e9ponses de la Cour Seigneuriale aux questions 7 et 9 qui lui furent pos\u00e9es. (Lower Canada Reports, vol. A, pp. 54 (a) et 56 (a).). La Cour Seigneuriale a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que ces lois \u00e9taient d\u2019ordre public (R\u00e9ponses aux questions 18, 19 et 20; loc. cit. pp. 63a et 64a). Les r\u00e9ponses de la Cour Seigneuriale sont d\u00e9cisives et ont la force de chose jug\u00e9e par un tribunal de dernier ressort\nsur le point soulev\u00e9 par cette question dans des cas semblables, quoique entre des parties diff\u00e9rentes (22 Vic., c. 3, s. 16, par. 9).\nIl y a, cependant, pour maintenir la validit\u00e9 des droits de Martin Paquette, une raison additionnelle. L\u2019acte seigneurial de 1854 pourvoit \u00e0 la confection du cadastre des seigneuries par un commissaire nomm\u00e9 par le gouverneur. Le propri\u00e9taire ou possesseur de la seigneurie pouvait para\u00eetre soit en personne, soit par son agent, devant le commissaire afin de faire corriger toute erreur qui pourrait se glisser dans ce cadastre. Ce cadastre \u00e9tait fait en triplicata; et, apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il \u00e9tait compl\u00e9t\u00e9, un exemplaire \u00e9tait transmis au Receveur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la province, un autre \u00e9tait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au greffe de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure du district, et le troisi\u00e8me restait sous le contr\u00f4le du commissaire. Avis public de tel d\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e9tait alors donn\u00e9, apr\u00e8s quoi, dit la loi (art. 14):\u2014\ntout censitaire de ladite seigneurie poss\u00e9dera, en vertu d\u2019icelui (le cadastre) son (fonds en franc alleu roturier, libre et franc de tous cens, lods et ventes, droits de banalit\u00e9, droits de retrait et autres droits * * * de quelque esp\u00e8ce qu\u2019ils soient, except\u00e9 la rente constitu\u00e9e qui sera substitu\u00e9e \u00e0 tous droits et charges seigneuriaux.\nPuis est venu l\u2019acte de 1855 (18 Vic., c. 103), qui a amend\u00e9 l\u2019Acte Seigneurial de 1854, et dont l\u2019article 11 s\u2019exprime comme suit:\u2014\nPour les fins dudit acte, toute personne qui occupe ou poss\u00e8de une terre dans une seigneurie avec la permission du seigneur, ou de qui le seigneur aura re\u00e7u des rentes ou autres redevances seigneuriales \u00e0 raison de cette terre, sera cens\u00e9e en \u00eatre propri\u00e9taire comme censitaire.\nEn 1854 et 1855, Martin Paquette occupait encore et poss\u00e9dait, avec la permission du seigneur, la terre qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conc\u00e9d\u00e9e en 1848. Son nom est entr\u00e9 au cadastre de la partie de l\u2019Augmentation de la seigneurie des Mille-Isles qui fut confirm\u00e9 et maintenu par la Cour de Revision des Cadastres en vertu de l\u2019Acte Seigneurial et de ses amendements. Il avait toujours pay\u00e9 jusque-l\u00e0 ses redevances seigneuriales \u00e0 raison de cette terre; et quels que fussent les d\u00e9fauts de son titre, il est donc cens\u00e9 en avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e8s lors le propri\u00e9taire comme censitaire en vertu des lois de 1854 et 1855.\nD\u2019ailleurs, l\u2019appelante a produit au dossier le livre terrier des seigneurs de l\u2019Augmentation des Mille-Isles; et, au num\u00e9ro 508 (correspondant \u00e0 celui du cadastre seigneurial) les seigneurs successeurs de Dame Marie-Elmire-Lambert Dumont (Madame Laviolette) et de Demoiselle Virginie Lambert Dumont (l\u2019appel\u00e9e \u00e0 la substitution lors de la vente \u00e0 Paquette), et les auteurs de qui l\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend tenir son titre, ont reconnu la qualit\u00e9 de propri\u00e9taire des successeurs de Martin Paquette et ont entr\u00e9 dans ce livre successivement le nom de Eug\u00e8ne Paquette et celui de Elie Guindon. Le livre terrier fait voir en m\u00eame temps que la rente a \u00e9t\u00e9 ponctuellement pay\u00e9e aux seigneurs.\nMartin Paquette a donc bien \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu, tant par la loi de 1855 que par les seigneurs successifs, comme \u00e9tant le propri\u00e9taire indiscutable de la concession qui lui fut faite par l\u2019acte du 21 novembre 1848. Et comme nous avons conclu, en outre, que cette concession jointe \u00e0 celle des terres num\u00e9ros 47, 48 et 49 de la rivi\u00e8re du Nord avait fait sortir le lac Bisson ou Guindon du domaine utile de la seigneurie de l\u2019Augmentation des Mille-Isles, il s\u2019ensuit que ce lac n\u2019a pu \u00eatre c\u00e9d\u00e9 et transmis \u00e0 l\u2019appelante par l\u2019acte qu\u2019elle a obtenu de Dame Elizabeth Globensky le 2 juin 1911 et que le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, qui l\u2019a d\u00e9bout\u00e9e des conclusions de son action, doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lamothe, Gadbois & Charbonneau.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Chas.

The partnership was dissolved, the others continuing the business on the premises. P. procured from the landlord a new lease dating from the expiry of the existing one. As a result of litigation, P., for a certain sum, assigned to the others the new lease, covenanting that the assignees might \u201chold and enjoy the said premises for the residue of the term granted by the said lease and every renewal thereof (if any) for their own use and benefit, without any interruption of the assignor.\u201d The lease had no provision for renewal. Before its expiry P. procured from the landlord a further lease dated from the expiry of the existing one. Plaintiffs, the aforesaid assignees or their successors in interest, sued for a declaration that P., the defendant, was a trustee of the lease for them, and for other relief.\nHeld, affirming judgment of the Appellate Division, Ont. (56 Ont. L.R. 616) that P. held the lease as trustee for plaintiffs; his obtaining it was a breach of good faith and contravened an implied obligation with regard to renewals; the allusion to renewal in the assignment must be taken to refer to the reasonable expectation of the tenants in possession to obtain a renewal; Griffith v. Owen ([1907] 1 Ch. 195) applied.\nHeld further, that plaintiffs were not estopped by res judicata by reason of certain overholding tenants proceedings (under The Landlord and Tenant Act, R.S.O., 1914, c. 155) and judgment therein; in such proceedings the judge had no jurisdiction to adjudicate as to the relations between Pong and plaintiffs.\nAPPEAL by the defendant Pong from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] which (reversing order of Mowat J.) declared that said defendant was trustee for the plaintiffs of a certain lease, and ordered that he assign it to the plaintiffs.\nThe plaintiff Quong and the defendant Pong were members of a firm carrying on a laundry business on premises leased from the defendant Mrs. Thomson. Mrs. Thomson had leased the premises to Pong in his own name for a term of three years from 1st March, 1916. Before the expiry of this lease, the partnership was dissolved (in November, 1917). Pong, in June, 1918, acquired a lease of the property in his own name for a period of five years, commencing on 1st March, 1919 (at the expiry of the first term). Litigation followed. A judgment of Winchester Co. C.J. contained an alternative direction that Pong should assign the lease to Quong and his co-partner in consideration of $600 to be paid to him. The lease was accordingly assigned, and in the assignment it was provided that the assignees might\nhold and enjoy the said premises for the residue of the term granted by the said lease and every renewal thereof (if any) for their own use and benefit, without any interruption of the assignor.\nThe lease did not contain any provision for renewal. Before the expiry of the lease, Pong procured from Mrs. Thomson a further lease of the premises for six years from 1st March, 1924 (the date of expiry of the existing lease). The plaintiffs, Quong and his co-partner Chong (who was the successor in interest of Quong\u2019s former co-partner Lum Lin), remained in possession after 1st March, 1924, being willing to assume the burden of the new lease (which was at an increased rental), and claiming the right to the benefit of it. They continued to pay rent which was taken by Mrs. Thomson without prejudice. The latter took proceedings under the overholding tenants provisions of The Landlord and Tenant Act, R.S.O., 1914, c. 155. The proceedings came on before His Honour, Judge Denton, of the County Court of the County of York. It was apparently agreed that the hearing should proceed on the basis of the assumption that rent from the plaintiffs had not been accepted by Mrs. Thomson; in other words, that, if Quong and Chong were not entitled to the benefit of the lease made to Pong, she should not be prejudiced in the proceedings by having taken rent from Quong and Chong. It appeared that the real dispute was between Pong on the one hand, and Quong and Chong on the other, as to the right to the lease. There was some discussion, and, apparently, misunderstanding, as to the question of jurisdiction, and consent in regard thereto, which is referred to in the judgment now reported.\nHis Honour, Judge Denton, held that the lease acquired by Pong was not a renewal, in any sense, of the former lease, and made an order for possession against the present plaintiffs. The latter appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, which dismissed the appeal without written reasons. See the reference to this appeal in the judgment now reported.\nThe plaintiffs then brought the present action in the Supreme Court of Ontario, claiming a declaration that the defendant Pong was a trustee for the plaintiffs of the lease, and that it should be assigned to them, and for an injunction restraining him from assigning the lease to any person other than the plaintiffs, and for an injunction restraining the defendant Mrs. Thomson from evicting them.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed by Mowat J. The plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario. By consent of counsel, the motion was turned into a motion for judgment and the case was heard upon the merits. The Appellate Division allowed the appeal, holding that the defendant Pong was a trustee of the lease for the plaintiffs, and that the lease should be assigned by Pong to the plaintiffs, who should covenant to indemnify him against the lessee\u2019s covenants contained therein[2].\nThe defendant Pong appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. His two main grounds of appeal were:2 That plaintiffs were estopped by res judicata by reason of the overholding tenants proceedings above mentioned and the judgment of Denton Co. C.J. therein, sustained by the Appellate Division; and (2) That, on the merits, the Appellate Division was wrong in holding that Pong should be deemed a trustee of the lease for the plaintiffs.\nNorman Sommerville K.C. for the appellant.\nFraser Raney for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nNo one appeared for the defendant (respondent) Mrs. Thomson. At the conclusion of the argument for the appellant, the Chief Justice orally delivered the judgment of the court as follows:\n\u201cIt is not necessary to call on you, Mr. Raney.\n\u201cWe have all had an opportunity of considering this case over night, and the position seems to us quite clear.\n\u201cThe first ground of appeal is that the respondent is estopped from bringing this action by reason of the judgment given in the overholding tenancy proceedings by His Honour, Judge Denton, nominally affirmed on appeal. I say \u201cnominally\u201d for reasons presently to appear.\n\u201cJudge Denton\u2019s only jurisdiction under the overholding tenants provisions was to determine the right of the landlord to possession. He himself states that in order that he should proceed it was necessary that there must be an admission before him that the rent had not been paid. His jurisdiction was to determine whether or not the landlord was entitled to possession. It was apparently desired that he should deal with issues as to the relationship of Pong and Quong, and determine the rights between them. Mr. Raney consented in some sort of form to that being done, but it would appear that his consent was given on the understanding and basis that the judge should deal with the matter as one within his jurisdiction under the overholding tenants provisions. It is perfectly manifest that he had no jurisdiction to do so\u2014no jurisdiction subject to appeal; that he could entertain such collateral matter only either as persona designata or as arbitrator. That being so, the Appellate Division, when the case came before it on appeal from Judge Denton, must have taken the view, as Mr. Raney states, and as the subsequent proceedings bear out, that the judge had assumed a jurisdiction he did not possess under the overholding tenants provisions, and that as to the relations between Pong and Quong the matter was coram non judice. Mr. Raney\u2019s consent had been given subject to a condition which could not be fulfilled; in other words, he consented upon the condition that he would retain an effective right of appeal. On the appeal in the present action, the Appellate Division must have taken the view that the former proceeding was not binding as to the obligations of Pong; that the only thing judici- ally determined by it was the landlord\u2019s right to possession, the order in this respect, assuming non-payment of rent, being within the jurisdiction of the judge who made it. Taking that view,\u2014and they of course knew what had been their appreciation of the former proceeding\u2014it was open to the Appellate Division to deal with the appeal from the judgment of Mowat J. in this action, as they did.\n\u201cThe other branch of the appeal is directed to the merits. It is claimed by the plaintiffs that the lease obtained by Pong is held by him as trustee for them. The Appellate Division gave effect to that contention, and, in our opinion, upon the whole case, rightly gave effect to it. It is manifest to us that the transaction carried out by Pong was in breach of good faith and contravened his obligation with regard to renewals, which was implied in the whole arrangement between him and Quong. While there is no express right of renewal in the lease, the assignment of it does deal with renewal, and the allusion must be taken to refer to the reasonable expectation of the tenant in possession to obtain a renewal. The case is fairly within the principle stated by Mr. Justice Parker in Griffith v. Owen. That principle was properly applied in the judgment now appealed from. That judgment is affirmed, and the appeal is dismissed with costs.\u201d\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Norman Sommerville & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondents, plaintiffs: Raney & Raney.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Mrs. Thomson: Grant & Grant.\n[1] (1925) 56 Ont.

(b) of subs. 4 of s. 4 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nMOTION for leave to appeal from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in bankruptcy at Montreal, Delormier J., and upholding its jurisdiction to hear the respondent\u2019s petition for a receiving order against the appellant under the Bankruptcy Act.\nThe facts are stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Rinfret on the application for leave.\nW. Chipman K.C. for motion.\nOscar P. Dorais K.C. contra.\nRinfret J.\u2014By petition dated 19th February, 1926, addressed to the Superior Court of the province of Quebec, at Montreal, the respondent prayed that a receiving order be granted against the debtor under the Bankruptcy Act. Notice was given to the debtor that the petition would be presented before the Superior Court on the 8th March, 1926. The debtor contested the petition for receiving order, alleging, amongst other things:\nThat the debtor does not come within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court under the Bankruptcy Act in the district of Montreal and that the latter court has no jurisdiction to hear the present petition.\nThat the debtor is, as alleged in the said petition, resident, practising and carrying on business in the town of Roberval, district of Roberval, where there is a competent court of jurisdiction under the Bankruptcy Act and before which he should have been summoned;\nThat all the assets of the said debtor are situate in the said district of Roberval at a distance of more than four hundred miles (400) from Montreal and within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court of the district of Roberval. Accordingly the petitioner concluded for the dismissal of the petition for receiving order, or alternatively, for the transfer of the record to the Superior Court, sitting in bankruptcy in the district of Roberval. The parties agreed that this question of jurisdiction should first be submitted to and decided by the court before proceeding upon the merits of the case.\nBy judgment rendered on the 12th May, 1926, Mr. Justice Delorimier decided that he, as a judge of the Superior Court, sitting in and for the district of Montreal, had jurisdiction to hear and decide the petition. The petitioner inscribed on appeal from this judgment; but, on the 23rd February, 1927, judgment was rendered by the Court of King\u2019s Bench sitting in appeal at Montreal, maintaining the original judgment, Mr. Justice Tellier dissenting.\nThe question to be decided in the present ease is one of jurisdiction as to whether the Superior Court of the province of Quebec, sitting in Montreal, is competent to hear and decide a petition for receiving order under the Bankruptcy Act made by a resident of Montreal against a debtor residing and carrying on business in the town of Roberval. It involves the interpretation of paragraph (6) of subsection 4 of section 4 of the Bankruptcy Act, reading as follows:\nThe petition shall foe presented to the court having jurisdiction in the locality of the debtor.\nThe \u201clocality of the debtor\u201d is defined in the Act (s. 2x):\n(a) the principal place where the debtor has carried business during the year immediately preceding the presentation against him of a bankruptcy petition or the making by him of an authorized assignment; or\n(b) the place where the debtor has resided during the year immediately preceding the date of the presentation against him of a bankruptcy petition or the making by him of an authorized assignment; or\n(c) in cases not coming within (a) or (b), the place where the greater portion of the property of such debtor is situate.\nThe effect of the judgments complained of is to hold that the \u201clocality of the debtor,\u201d in this case, is the whole province of Quebec; and this is alleged to be contrary to the Bankruptcy Act, as it enables one particular creditor to choose the judicial district in which he desires the bankruptcy proceedings to take place and to force the debtor to leave his place of business or residence and go possibly to the other end of the province in order to defend himself against the petition and also to compel all the other creditors to come to the bankruptcy district chosen by the caprice of the petitioner.\nThis decision, affecting, as it does, the jurisdiction of the courts under the Bankruptcy Act, is of great importance and of general interest (Riley v. Curtis\u2019s and Harvey[1]), and there does not appear to be any jurisprudence upon this question in Canada at the present time.\nThe point is raised, however, that this court is not competent to entertain this appeal.\nIn addition to its ordinary jurisdiction, covered by the Supreme Court Act, the Supreme Court of Canada also holds jurisdiction \u201cas provided in any other Act covering jurisdiction\u201d (Supreme Court Act, s. 43); and this is \u201cnotwithstanding anything contained in the Supreme Court Act.\u201d\nThe statutory provision by virtue of which this court holds jurisdiction in bankruptcy proceedings is contained in the Bankruptcy Act, c. 36 of the statutes of 1919, s. 74. It gives an appeal to the appeal court from an order or decision of a court or judge sitting in bankruptcy if the question to be raised on the appeal involves future rights; or if the order or decision is likely to affect other cases of a similar nature in the bankruptcy or authorized assignment proceedings; or if the amount involved in the appeal exceeds five hundred dollars; or if the appeal is from the grant or refusal to grant a discharge and the aggregate of the unpaid claims of creditors exceeds five hundred dollars.\nIn this case the appeal court, the Court of King\u2019s Bench of the province of Quebec, has entertained jurisdiction holding that the decision of Mr. Justice Delorimier came within one of the classes of cases where section 74 authorizes an appeal.\nUnder subsections 3 and 4, the decision of the appeal court \u201cupon any such appeal\u201d is final and conclusive unless special leave to appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court of Canada is obtained from a judge of this court; but this court is expressly given jurisdiction to hear and decide any appeal so permitted. It follows that the competency of the Supreme Court of Canada in the present case is to be looked for in the Bankruptcy Act alone and is not controlled by the sections of the Supreme Court Act dealing with its ordinary jurisdiction.\nUnder those circumstances, I am of opinion that the petitioner has made out a sufficient case to obtain leave to appeal to this court. Such appeal shall operate as a stay of proceedings until it has been finally determined by this court.\nThe appellant shall not be required to provide security for costs; but if he should choose to do so, in order to found a claim to be awarded costs in the event of his success upon his appeal, I fix the amount of five hundred dollars ($500) for such security.\nMotion granted.\n[1] (1919) 59 Can.

I will be grateful if you will be kind enough to let me know what steps you are taking in the matter.\u201d He waited for an answer until the 16th May, and receiving none, he wrote again to Mr. Cr\u00e9peau and to the mayor including a copy of the letter to Cr\u00e9peau,\nOn the 20th of the same month, the mayor wrote to respondent\u2019s husband as follows:\n\u201cYours of the 16th instant received together with copy of letter mentioned. I referred your letter to Mr. Jules Cr\u00e9peau, director of departments to be submitted to the executive committee.\u201d\nCr\u00e9peau paid no attention, either to the mayor\u2019s letters or to the letters of the respondent. Nowhere was any objection raised to the sufficiency of the notice.\nSometime previous to the 10th of June following, the respondent\u2019s husband put the matter in the hands of his solicitors, who, unaware that a previous notice had been given, caused to be prepared a formal notice which was served on the city. This notice is dated the first of June and contains full details of the accident in compliance with the charter, with the exception of the delay from the date of the accident.\nThe trial judge maintained the respondent\u2019s action and gave judgment for $5,000 damages.\nAmongst the consid\u00e9rants in the judgment of the trial judge were the following:\n\u201cConsidering that plaintiff\u2019s original notice of suit was received by the mayor of the city defendant, and that the said mayor handed same, or at least left plaintiff under the impression that he had handed it to the officer of the defendant whom he as mayor looked upon as the party empowered to deal with it, namely the director of departments;\n\u201cConsidering that within the thirty days of the said accident, namely on March 30, 1925, plaintiff\u2019s husband wrote to the said director of departments referring him to the mayor\u2019s reply, and asking him what steps he was taking in the matter;\n\u201cConsidering that all the said, letters were duly forwarded to the city clerk\u2019s office, but appear to have remained unanswered, according to the admissions in defendant\u2019s discovery; \u201cConsidering that under the circumstances, the said letters constitute a valid notice to the city defendant;\n\u201cConsidering that it is true that the said notice did not specify the place where the said accident occurred, but that plaintiff, in the Montreal General Hospital, and her husband, either at his domicile or at his place of business indicated in the notices, were at all times ready to give information to the city defendant; that in any event two of the city defendant\u2019s constables were made aware of the accident shortly after it took place, and arrived at the Montreal General Hospital shortly after the plaintiff and her husband; that they may have secured all requisite information had they persisted in their inquiries;\n\u201cConsidering that if defendant, having been placed in a position to receive information as to the said accident, refused to take advantage of its opportunities, it cannot set up ignorance as an excuse;\n* * *\n\u201cConsidering that in any event, a perfectly valid notice was served on the defendant by plaintiff\u2019s attorneys on the 10th day of June, 1925; that the said notice was just as effective and useful as if it had been served on the 30th day following plaintiff\u2019s accident; that the court, under section 536 of the charter of the city defendant, as amended, has discretionary power to decide whether or not in the special circumstances of each case, the default or a fortiori, the tardiness of a notice deprives a plaintiff of his right of action; that under the circumstances of the present case, plaintiff should not be deprived of her right of action for any irregularity in her notice of suit;\nChs. Laurendeau K.C. and G. St. Pierre K.C. for the appellant.\nO. S. Tyndale K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014The only question submitted by the appellant on this appeal is whether the notice which the respondent gave to the city of the accident for which she recovered damages, complied with the requirements of section 536 of the Monteal city charter. The appellant did not otherwise, before this court, question its liability for the accident.\nThe contention of the appellant is that the letter written to the mayor of Montreal by the respondent\u2019s husband, on March 19, 1925, two days after the accident, did not sufficiently specify the place where the accident occurred, when it stated that the respondent had been the victim of an accident on St. Catherine street, which is a street several miles long.\nThe mayor answered this letter on March 21, saying that he was referring the letter immediately to Mr. Jules Cr\u00e9peau, director of departments, with a request to give to the question his immediate attention. And on March 30, the respondent\u2019s husband wrote to Mr. Cr\u00e9peau, enclosing a copy of the mayor\u2019s letter. He added that he would be grateful if Mr. Cr\u00e9peau would be kind enough to let him know what steps he was taking in the matter. This letter was never answered.\nIn our opinion the learned trial judge could find on this correspondence that the conduct of the city authorities, and especially the letter of the mayor, were of a nature to lull the respondent into a sense of security and to give her cause to believe that the notice of her claim for damages was accepted as sufficient by the city. Under these circumstances and for this reason, the learned judge could come to the conclusion that the respondent was entitled to the benefit of the third paragraph of section 536 which states that\nthe default of such notice, however, shall not deprive the victims of an accident of their right of action, if they prove that they were prevented from giving such notice by irresistable force, or for any other reason deemed valid by the judge or court.\nThe respondent was prevented from giving a more explicit notice by the conduct of the city officials, and this is a reason which we deem valid.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs, but the consid\u00e9rants of the judgment of the Superior Court based on the absence of prejudice to the city, on its having been placed in a position to receive information as to the accident, and having refused to take advantage of its opportunities, and on the notice served on the city by the respondent\u2019s attorneys on June 10, 1925,\u2014should be struck from the judgment.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Damphousse, Butler & St. Pierre.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Brown Montgomery & McMichael.\n[1] (1926) Q.R. 41 K.B. 529.\n",

Il a port\u00e9 sa cause devant la Cour du Banc du Roi en se basant, entre autres moyens, sur les griefs de droit qui suivent:\u2014\n1\u00b0 Il n\u2019y avait pas au dossier la corroboration exig\u00e9e par l\u2019article 1002 du Code Criminel;\n2\u00b0 Une signature fictive sur le document incrimin\u00e9 de faux (\u00e0 savoir: sur une demande de licence pour automobile) ne constitue pas le crime de faux pr\u00e9vu au Code Criminel.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a rejet\u00e9 ces deux griefs et a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du premier tribunal.\nL\u2019appelant all\u00e8gue que cet arr\u00eat est contraire \u00e0 deux jugements des cours d\u2019appel de la province d\u2019Ontario et invoque cette pr\u00e9tendue contradiction \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa requ\u00eate devant cette cour. Il se r\u00e9clame de l\u2019article 1024a du Code Criminel.\nCet article, pour autoriser un juge \u00e0 permettre l\u2019appel \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, ne se pr\u00e9occupe en aucune fa\u00e7on du bien ou mal fond\u00e9 du jugement a quo, mais il exige que l\u2019on d\u00e9montre que ce jugement entre en conflit avec l\u2019arr\u00eat d\u2019un autre tribunal d\u2019appel provincial. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que ces arr\u00eats aient \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9s dans une cause identique (The King v. Book)[1]; mais il faut au moins qu\u2019une question de droit analogue, servant de base \u00e0 chacun des arr\u00eats, ait \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e par chaque cour d\u2019appel dans un sens diff\u00e9rent.\nIci, l\u2019appelant interpr\u00e8te le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi comme ayant d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en principe que le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un expert en \u00e9criture constitue la corroboration vis\u00e9e par l\u2019article 1002 du Code Criminel. Il y voit un conflit avec la, d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019Appel d\u2019Ontario dans l\u2019affaire de The Queen v. McBride[2].\nM. le juge Bernier, parlant au nom de la cour dans la cause actuelle, dit qu\u2019une demande pour licence d\u2019automobile, sign\u00e9e du nom de Joseph Church, a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour enregistrement au bureau de Marieville. Joseph Church y \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9 comme propri\u00e9taire de la voiture et r\u00e9sidant au n\u00b0 997, rue Evelyn, \u00e0 Verdun.\nLa licence fut accord\u00e9e.\nLa preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que le pr\u00e9tendu Joseph Church n\u2019existait pas et que la demande a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e d\u2019un nom fictif.\nPar contre, c\u2019est l\u2019accus\u00e9 qui demeurait \u00e0 l\u2019adresse indiqu\u00e9e et qui \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de la maison portant cette adresse.\nLe 26 mai 1925, trois demandes pour licence en vertu de la loi des v\u00e9hicules-moteurs (respectivement comme chauffeur, comme commer\u00e7ant d\u2019automobiles et comme propri\u00e9taire de garage), sign\u00e9es du nom de l\u2019accus\u00e9, furent d\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u00e0 Marieville. Mademoiselle M. Gareau, qui les a re\u00e7ues, a identifi\u00e9 l\u2019accus\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant celui qui les a sign\u00e9es. Elle a alors \u00e9pingl\u00e9 elle-m\u00eame la photographie de Barr\u00e9 sur la licence de chauffeur.\nDeux experts jurent que la demande du pr\u00e9tendu Joseph Church et les trois demandes re\u00e7ues par Mademoiselle Gareau sont \u00e9crites de la m\u00eame main.\nL\u2019on a aussi \u00e9tabli les circonstances suivantes: au cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, le procureur de l\u2019accus\u00e9 a soulev\u00e9 un doute sur le num\u00e9ro de l\u2019automobile pour laquelle la licence avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e. Le procureur de la Couronne donna imm\u00e9diatement des ordres pour qu\u2019on emmen\u00e2t la voiture \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Or, on avait devanc\u00e9 cette d\u00e9marche; quelqu\u2019un \u00e9tait all\u00e9 changer les chiffres du num\u00e9ro, \u00e0 Thetford Mines, o\u00f9 se trouvait la voiture. Enfin, le document argu\u00e9 de faux portait au verso le nom \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 effac\u00e9 d\u2019un parent de l\u2019appelant, un nomm\u00e9 Arcade Dubois.\nC\u2019est dans ces t\u00e9moignages et dans toutes ces circonstances que la Cour du Banc du Roi a trouv\u00e9 la preuve et la corroboration suffisante pour justifier la conviction et la condamnation de l\u2019accus\u00e9 en Cour des Sessions de la Paix. M. le juge Bernier le dit:\u2014\nEn vertu de l\u2019article 1002 C. Or., nulle personne ne peut \u00eatre convaincue sur le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un seul t\u00e9moin, dans un cas de faux, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il ne soit corrobor\u00e9 sous quelque rapport essentiel. Or, dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, il ne peut y avoir de doute qu\u2019il y a eu corroboration sur l\u2019accusation port\u00e9e contre l\u2019appelant. J\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 ces faits de corroboration; ils sont multiples.\nOn ne saurait donc, comme le fait l\u2019appelant, r\u00e9duire ce jugement \u00e0 la simple proposition \u201cque le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un expert en \u00e9criture constitue la corroboration vis\u00e9e par l\u2019article 1002 du Code Criminel\u201d. Ce n\u2019est pas sur ce principe que la Cour du Banc du Roi a appuy\u00e9 son jugement. Elle a trouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait des t\u00e9moins et de \u201cmultiples\u201d faits de corroboration.\nCe n\u2019est pas non plus, \u00e0 notre avis, le principe contraire qui est affirm\u00e9 par la cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario re The Queen v. McBride[3]. La preuve dans cette cause consistait dans la d\u00e9position d\u2019un seul t\u00e9moin \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019\u00e9criture sur les documents argu\u00e9s de faux et l\u2019\u00e9criture dans un certain livre produit \u00e9tait dans chaque cas celle de l\u2019accus\u00e9. La cour refusa d\u2019y voir la corroboration exig\u00e9e par le code et s\u2019en expliqua comme suit:\u2014\nThat the signatures in question and the names in the book were in the same handwriting in no way implicated the accused, unless it was shewn that the names in the book were written by the accused, and the only evidence of that was the evidence of Davis.\nIt is clear, therefore, that Davis was the only witness who implicated the accused, and that there was no such corroboration of his evidence as is required to justify a conviction.\nNous ne voyons ni dans l\u2019un, ni dans l\u2019autre arr\u00eat la discussion de la question de savoir si \u201cle t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un expert en \u00e9criture constitue la corroboration vis\u00e9e par l\u2019article 1002 du Code Criminel\u201d. Il n\u2019a donc pu y avoir conflit de d\u00e9cision sur cette question. En somme, une cour a jug\u00e9 dans une esp\u00e8ce qu\u2019il y avait t\u00e9moignage et corroboration par des faits \u201cmultiples\u201d; l\u2019autre cour, qu\u2019un seul et m\u00eame t\u00e9moin d\u00e9posant uniquement quant \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 de plusieurs \u00e9crits et les attribuant \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 ne pouvait constituer \u00e0 la fois le t\u00e9moignage et la corroboration requis par le code.\nL\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas plus heureux sur son second moyen.\nDans la cause re Murphy[4], o\u00f9 il pr\u00e9tend trouver l\u2019affirmation d\u2019un principe de droit contraire \u00e0 celui qui est soutenu dans l\u2019arr\u00eat qui l\u2019a condamn\u00e9, la cour d\u2019appel de. l\u2019Ontario, form\u00e9e en cette circonstance de quatre juges seulement, s\u2019est divis\u00e9e \u00e9galement sur la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 rendre. On peut se demander si un partage \u00e9gal d\u2019opinions dans un tribunal d\u2019appel constitue un jugement, et surtout s\u2019il peut en r\u00e9sulter un arr\u00eat de principe oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 celui d\u2019un autre tribunal, tel que requis par l\u2019article 1024a du Code Criminel. (Voir Beamish v. Beamish (1); lire Lumsden v. Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway Commission (2), r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 McArthur v. Northern and Pacific Junction Railway Company (3); voir Stuart v. Bank of Montreal (4). Si Ton r\u00e9pondait dans la n\u00e9gative, il manquerait ici l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel pour donner ouverture \u00e0 un appel \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada.\nMais, dans cette cause de Murphy (5), l\u2019une des questions discut\u00e9es par l\u2019un des juges d\u2019appel seulement (lequel par surcro\u00eet n\u2019\u00e9tait pas du c\u00f4t\u00e9 dont l\u2019opinion a pr\u00e9valu) avait une analogie \u00e9loign\u00e9e avec celle qui sert de base au deuxi\u00e8me moyen de l\u2019appelant. Les autres juges, tant dans la \u201cCommon Pleas Division\u201d que dans la \u201cCourt of Appeal,\u201d ont exprim\u00e9 leur avis sur le point que, sur demande d\u2019extradition pour crime de faux, il suffit de justifier de faits qui constituent un faux suivant la loi de notre pays, sans qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9tablir quels sont les \u00e9l\u00e9ments constitutifs du crime de faux dans le pays \u00e9tranger pour qui l\u2019extradition est poursuivie. Il n\u2019y a aucun rapprochement possible entre cette question et celle sur laquelle l\u2019appelant fonde le second moyen de sa requ\u00eate.\nLa permission d\u2019appel \u00e0 cette cour ne peut donc se justifier en vertu de l\u2019article 1024a du Code Criminel et elle doit \u00eatre refus\u00e9e.\nMotion dismissed.\n[1] [1926] S.C.R.481.\n[2] (1895) 2 Can.

Rouleau\nCollection\nSupreme Court Judgments\nDate\n1927-02-01\nReport\n[1927] SCR 288\nJudges\nAnglin, Francis Alexander; Duff, Lyman Poore; Mignault, Pierre-Basile; Newcombe, Edmund Leslie; Rinfret, Thibaudeau\nOn appeal from\nQuebec\nSubjects\nSale\nDecision Content\nSupreme Court Of Canada\nLamy v. Rouleau, [1927] S.C.R. 288\nDate: 1927-02-01\nAlphonse Lamy (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nDame Albina Rouleau (Plaintiff), Respondent.\n1926: October 26, 27; 1927: February 1.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nSale\u2014Sheriff\u2019s sale\u2014Resale for false bidding\u2014Loan\u2014Promise of \u201cfournir et faire valoir\"\u2014Confusion\u2014Arts. 1085, 1138, 1571, 1572, 1577, 1958, 1959, 2127 C.C.\u2014Arts. 747, 758, 761 to 765, 778 C.C.P.\nThe garantie de fournir et faire valoir stipulated in a deed of transfer of debt has the effect of suretyship. Upon failure by the principal debtor to pay, such guarantee gives rise to an action de recours in favour of the transferee against the guarantor.\nWhen a debt is transferred, the debtor is a \u201cthird person\u201d within the meaning of art. 1571 C.C., and the transferee acquires possession available against him only upon service of the transfer being made upon the debtor. Mere registration of the transfer is not sufficient.\nSo long as the transfer has not been served (or has not been accepted by the debtor) the transferor, with regard to third persons, remains the possessor and the owner off the debt.\nAs a result, the debtor is liable to the transferee only in so far as he is obligated to the transferor at the time when the transfer is served. As against the debtor, the transfer must be considered as having taken place only on the date of its signification to him.\nAny mode of extinction of the debt (as, for example, compensation) operating between the debtor and the transferor previous to the service of the transfer upon the debtor has the effect of discharging the debtor, even as against the transferee.\nThe adjudication at a sheriff\u2019s sale, although not perfect until the price is paid, is nevertheless a sale under suspensive condition and the purchaser becomes the debtor of the price of adjudication. He is not discharged by the fact that a demand is made for resale for false bidding, but he remains debtor of the amount of his bid (together with interest, costs and damages), saving that he is entitled to credit for the amount of the price brought by the resale.\nUpon the record in this case, the respondent was not entitled to succeed. C., as a false bidder at the sheriff\u2019s sale, owed the amount of his bid of $34,000 (less the proceeds of the final resale) at the time of the institution of the action. Although the appellant, in ordinary circumstances, would have been responsible to C. in virtue of the clause of warranty de fournir et faire valoir contained in the transfer by him to C., such responsibility was extinguished when C. himself became liable for the amount so guaranteed, C. being then in fact warrantor of his own cr\u00e9ance. Therefore, as C. could not have recovered against the appellant, the respondent\u2019s husband who, by the transfer served on the 27th of March, 1924, acquired only the rights which C. had on that date, was not entitled to recover from the appellant. C. would in fact be liable to the appellant for any amount which the latter might be obliged to pay to the respondent.\nThe case is remitted to the trial court in order to ascertain whether, if C. had deposited the amount of his bid at the sheriff\u2019s sale, $34,000, that sum would, upon a judgment of distribution, have provided for payment in full of the respondent\u2019s claim of $5,000 and interest. Should it prove sufficient, the action should be dismissed; if not, it should be maintained for so much of the claim as would not have been collocated in a judgment of distribution.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 41 K.B.9) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court at Montreal and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action. Previous to the year 1921, the appellant had loaned to one Legault $40,000 and had taken as security an hypothec upon a certain immoveable. Later the appellant transferred to one Chauret $7,000 of his $40,000 claim against Legault and the transfer was made with the promise de fournir et faire valoir. Chauret caused to be served a copy of this transfer upon the principal debtor Legault and thereby, between the latter, the appellant and himself, Chauret became fully vested with the complete ownership of the claim to that extent. On the 24th of February, 1921, Chauret transferred $5,000 of that claim to one Boyer, who later died leaving his wife, the respondent, whom he had constituted his universal legatee. In this second transfer, there was no guarantee de fournir et faire valoir by Chauret, but he transferred to the respondent all his rights and title against Legault, the principal debtor, and also against the appellant, as guarantor. The respondent, however, neglected to perfect her title as against these two debtors, and caused her transfer to be served upon them only on the 27th of March, 1924. Before such service, an hypothecary action had been instituted by one Wilson against one Robin who was then the tiers-d\u00e9tenteur of the hypothecated property. Judgment having been obtained, the property was surrendered by the tiers-d\u00e9tenteur; it was seized upon the curator to the surrender and brought to sale by the sheriff on the 4th of October, 1923. Chauret bid upon the property, which was adjudicated to him by the sheriff for the price of $34,000. Upon his failure to pay the amount of his bid, the property was resold for false bidding and adjudicated to one Taylor for $22,350. Taylor in turn made default and the property was again resold for false bidding and adjudicated for $21,625. This last resale took place after the service of the transfer from Chauret to Boyer upon the principal debtor and upon the appellant. As the principal debtor was insolvent, Boyer brought action against the appellant for the recovery of the sum of $5,428.30, being the capital and the interest then due in virtue of the transfer by Chauret to Boyer, the respondent\u2019s husband, upon the ground that the appellant had guaranteed de fournir et faire valoir the payment of that sum in his deed of transfer to Chauret.

Voici maintenant comment le juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure soumet la question \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre (et il nous para\u00eet avoir exactement pos\u00e9 le probl\u00e8me):\u2014\nParce que Chauret s\u2019est port\u00e9 adjudicataire et n\u2019a pu payer le prix d\u2019adjudication, l\u2019appelant refuse d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter, en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019obligation qu\u2019il a transport\u00e9e \u201cavec garantie de fournir et faire valoir et de payer \u00e0 d\u00e9faut du d\u00e9biteur\u201d, en soumettant que la subrogation est rest\u00e9e sans effet \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, tant qu\u2019il n\u2019en a pas eu signification, et que Chauret n\u2019a pas cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre propri\u00e9taire et seul responsable de la cr\u00e9ance \u00e0 partir de l\u2019adjudication qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, le 4 octobre 1923, et que si Chauret n\u2019eut pas transport\u00e9 ses droits avec subrogation \u00e0 l\u2019auteur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, il n\u2019aurait pas eu le droit de r\u00e9clamer de l\u2019appelant, parce qu\u2019il est devenu lui-m\u00eame d\u00e9biteur de la diff\u00e9rence entre la premi\u00e8re et la derni\u00e8re adjudication; ce qui \u00e9tait suffisant pour satisfaire sa r\u00e9clamation contre le d\u00e9biteur principal et l\u2019appelant et partant pour satisfaire le subrog\u00e9 Boyer, auteur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nLa solution de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, c\u2019est que l\u2019appelant est d\u00e9biteur de la somme qui lui est r\u00e9clam\u00e9e. Il n\u2019a c\u00e9d\u00e9 ses droits \u00e0 personne autre qu\u2019\u00e0 Chauret. Legault, le d\u00e9biteur principal, n\u2019a rien pay\u00e9. Chauret, dont la subrogation \u00e0 l\u2019auteur de la demanderesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e et signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 Legault le 27 mars 1924, n\u2019a rien pay\u00e9 non plus. Le savant juge en conclut qu\u2019ils ne sont donc pas lib\u00e9r\u00e9s. Chauret, d\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, aurait pu r\u00e9clamer de Legault, et l\u2019appelant aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de lui payer, si Legault avait fait d\u00e9faut, car la diff\u00e9rence entre le montant de la premi\u00e8re adjudication et celui de l\u2019adjudication d\u00e9finitive\nn\u2019appartient pas au d\u00e9fendeur (appelant), mais au sh\u00e9rif pour les cr\u00e9anciers judiciaires et le saisi dans la cause de Wilson v. Robin.\nCette diff\u00e9tfence n\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs devenue due que lorsque la derni\u00e8re adjudication a eu lieu. Jusque-l\u00e0, la vente au sh\u00e9rif n\u2019\u00e9tait pas parfaite, et longtemps avant qu\u2019elle ne le dev\u00eent la cession \u00e0 l\u2019auteur de la demanderesse avait \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e et signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 Legault et \u00e0 l\u2019appelant. Le raisonnement est donc que l\u2019appelant, caution de Legault et qui s\u2019\u00e9tait m\u00eame rendu personnellement responsable de Legault par la clause de garantie, est encore d\u00e9biteur envers la demanderesse.\nCe jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nM. le juge Dorion a exprim\u00e9 son dissentiment. Il \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que Chauret, devenu adjudicataire le 4 octobre 1923, avait n\u00e9glig\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame de faire valoir sa cr\u00e9ance en payant le prix de l\u2019immeuble qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adjug\u00e9, qu\u2019il avait par l\u00e0 laiss\u00e9 perdre les s\u00fbret\u00e9s attach\u00e9es \u00e0 sa cr\u00e9ance (et) s\u2019\u00e9tait mis dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019exercer contre Lamy la garantie de fournir et faire valoir.\nComme la signification du transport de Chauret \u00e0 Boyer n\u2019a eu lieu que le 27 mars 1924, \u00e0 ce moment il n\u2019a pu donner \u00e0 Boyer le droit, qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 lui-m\u00eame perdu, d\u2019exercer la garantie contre Lamy. A ce moment, il d\u00e9pendait de lui de faire r\u00e9aliser la cr\u00e9ance en payant ce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tenu de payer.\nNon seulement il a laiss\u00e9 perdre la garantie, mais il l\u2019a fait perdre.\nDans ces conditions, Chauret ne pourrait certainement pas r\u00e9clamer de Legault (ni, par cons\u00e9quent, de l\u2019appelant). C\u2019est, au contraire, Legault (ou l\u2019appelant) qui pourrait le forcer \u00e0 payer la diff\u00e9rence entre le montant de son ench\u00e8re et celui de l\u2019adjudication d\u00e9finitive \u201cet \u00e0 payer ainsi la dette\u201d. Il resterait donc \u00e0 savoir si le montant de l\u2019ench\u00e8re de Chauret ($34,000) e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisant pour satisfaire la cr\u00e9ance qui fait l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente action. Pour v\u00e9rifier cela il faut faire le rapport de distribution tel qu\u2019il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 fait apr\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re adjudication. M. le juge Dorion aurait donc retourn\u00e9 le dossier \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour y faire d\u00e9terminer quel e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 le jugement de distribution du montant de l\u2019ench\u00e8re de Chauret, r\u00e9servant \u00e0 adjuger apr\u00e8s que cet \u00e9tat e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli.\nLa demanderesse est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e au cours du proc\u00e8s et l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui est son ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, a fait les proc\u00e9dures requises pour reprendre l\u2019instance.\nL\u2019acte de transport de l\u2019appelant Lamy \u00e0 Chauret s\u2019exprime ainsi:\u2014\nLequel par ces pr\u00e9sentes c\u00e8de et transporte avec garantie de fournir et faire valoir et de payer, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut du d\u00e9biteur, \u00e0 Ad\u00e9odat Chauret, etc.\nLe d\u00e9biteur, dans cette clause, c\u2019est Legault. La garantie qui y est stipul\u00e9e \u201cne produit qu\u2019un cautionnement\u201d. (I Bourjon, Dr. Comm., tit. 4, sec. 3, n\u00b0 25; et Loyseau, Garantie des rentes, ch. 4, n\u00b0 13: tous deux cit\u00e9s par les codificateurs sous l\u2019art. 1577 du code civil). Par cet engagement, Lamy s\u2019est rendu caution de Legault. Il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9faut de paiement par Legault il na\u00eet de cette clause, au profit de Chauret, une \u201caction de recours\u201d contre Lamy (Pothier, vol. 3, n08 563, 564; 2 Colin et Capitant, p. 154).\nEn revanche, Lamy peut opposer \u00e0 Chauret toutes les exceptions qui appartiennent \u00e0 Legault et qui sont inh\u00e9rentes \u00e0 la dette (art. 1958 C.C.). Chauret a c\u00e9d\u00e9 son droit de cr\u00e9ance \u00e0 Boyer, le 24 f\u00e9vrier 1921, et ce transport fut enregistr\u00e9 le 23 avril 1923, mais il ne fut signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 Legault que le 27 mars 1924.\nLegault, le d\u00e9biteur, \u00e9tait un \u201ctiers\", au sens de l\u2019article 1571 C.C. (The Bank of Toronto v. The St. Lawrence Fire Insurance Co.[2]; Baudry-Lacantinerie, 3e \u00e9d., De la vente et de l\u2019\u00e9change, nos 788, 789). Cela ressort in\u00e9vitablement du fait que la signification peut \u00eatre remplac\u00e9e \u201cpar l\u2019acceptation du transport que fait le d\u00e9biteur\u201d (art. 1571 C.C.).\nL\u2019enregistrement du transport, le 23 avril 1923, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisant pour donner \u00e0 Boyer la \u201cpossession utile\u201d \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de Legault. Le code exige que l\u2019acte de vente des cr\u00e9ances soit signifi\u00e9 et qu\u2019il en soit d\u00e9livr\u00e9 copie au d\u00e9biteur (arts. 1571, 2127 C.C.).\nTant que la signification n\u2019a pas eu lieu (27 mars 1924), le cr\u00e9ancier \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Legault \u00e9tait toujours Chauret. L\u2019emploi dans l\u2019article 1571 du mot \u201cpossession\u201d au lieu du mot \u201ctitre\u201d n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par le l\u00e9gislateur dans le but de laisser entendre que le cessionnaire, avant la signification, \u00e9tait investi du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sans en avoir encore re\u00e7u la tradition. Les codificateurs (4e rapport, p. 21) d\u00e9clarent que\nles articles de cette section co\u00efncident avec le Code Napol\u00e9on, de m\u00eame qu\u2019avec l\u2019ancien droit, except\u00e9 dans les cas sp\u00e9cialement mentionn\u00e9s.\nAucune mention sp\u00e9ciale n\u2019est faite au sujet de l\u2019article 1571 C.C.\nSous l\u2019ancien droit, Pothier \u00e9crit:\u2014\nLe transport d\u2019une rente ou autre cr\u00e9ance est, avant que la signification en ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite au d\u00e9biteur, ce qu\u2019est la vente d\u2019une chose corporelle avant la tradition; de m\u00eame que le vendeur d\u2019une chose corporelle demeure, avant que la tradition en ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, possesseur et propri\u00e9taire de la chose qu\u2019il a vendue, ainsi que nous l\u2019avons \u00e9tabli alors; de m\u00eame, tant que le cessionnaire n\u2019a pas fait signifier au d\u00e9biteur le transport qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, le C\u00e9dant n\u2019est dessaisi de la chose qu\u2019il a transport\u00e9e. C\u2019est ce que porte l\u2019art. 108 de la Coutume de Paris: \u201cUn simple transport ne saisit point, il faut signifier le transport \u00e0 la partie, et en bailler copie\nLe Code Napol\u00e9on a conserv\u00e9 l\u2019expression de la Coutume de Paris. L\u2019article 1690 porte:\u2014\nLe cessionnaire n\u2019est saisi \u00e0 d\u2019\u00e9gard des tiers que par la signification du transport faite au d\u00e9biteur. N\u00e9anmoins, le cessionnaire peut \u00eatre \u00e9galement saisi par l\u2019acceptation du transport faite par le d\u00e9biteur dans un acte authentique. La citation de Pothier explique le sens que Ton attachait dans l\u2019ancien droit au mot \u201csaisi\u201d. En toutes choses, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ne passait alors \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur qu\u2019avec la possession. Mais, comme le fait observer Laurent (Vol. 24, p. 473),\nce qui autrefois \u00e9tait le droit commun est devenu dans le droit moderne une exception. L\u2019acqu\u00e9reur d\u2019une chose corporelle devient maintenant propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des tiers, comme \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du vendeur, par le seul (fait de la convention ou du concours de volont\u00e9s: tel \u00e9tait, du moins, le syst\u00e8me du code civil; tandis que, pour la cession de cr\u00e9ances, la loi exige une formalit\u00e9, une signification, une acceptation, pour que le cessionnaire devienne propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des tiers. Tel est le sens du mot saisi et du principe que la loi \u00e9tablit.\nD\u2019ailleurs la comparaison entre les deux articles 1570 et 1571 C.C. le d\u00e9montre. La vente est\nparfaite entre le vendeur et l\u2019acheteur par l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du titre, s\u2019il est authentique, ou sa d\u00e9livrance, s\u2019il est sous seing priv\u00e9.\nElle ne l\u2019est pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des tiers\ntant que l\u2019acte de vente n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 et qu\u2019il n\u2019en a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 copie au d\u00e9biteur.\nAvant l\u2019accomplissement de ces formalit\u00e9s (et sauf que la signification de l\u2019action peut y suppl\u00e9er, ainsi qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 Re Bank of Toronto v. St. Lawrence Fire Insurance Company[3]. la vente du droit de cr\u00e9ance reste donc incompl\u00e8te et ne peut, par cons\u00e9quent, transf\u00e9rer au cessionnaire le titre de propri\u00e9taire.\nIl s\u2019ensuit que le d\u00e9biteur c\u00e9d\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre tenu envers le cessionnaire que de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re qu\u2019il est oblig\u00e9 envers le c\u00e9dant au moment de la signification du transport. (Dalloz, Codes annot\u00e9s, Nouveau code civil, sous article 1690, n\u00b0 376).\nA l\u2019encontre des tiers, l\u2019acheteur d\u2019une cr\u00e9ance, tant qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas signifi\u00e9 l\u2019acte de cession, acquiert si peu le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la cr\u00e9ance que si le m\u00eame vendeur consent un second transport \u00e0 un autre cessionnaire qui fasse signifier, c\u2019est ce dernier qui obtient le titre \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ance, et le premier transport est sans effet \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ce cessionnaire subs\u00e9quent (art. 2127 C.C.). Le titre, quant aux tiers, reste donc sur la t\u00eate du c\u00e9dant, puisqu\u2019il peut encore le conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 un second cessionnaire qui se conforme aux exigences de la loi. De m\u00eame, une cr\u00e9ance c\u00e9d\u00e9e est susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre saisie-arr\u00eat\u00e9e tant que le transport n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 ou qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 valablement accept\u00e9 (Fuzier-Herman, R\u00e9pertoire, vo. Cession de cr\u00e9ance, n\u00b0 287). En vertu de ces principes, Chauret et Boyer sont donc dans la m\u00eame position vis-\u00e0-vis de Legault (et, par cons\u00e9quent, de Lamy, qui peut se pr\u00e9valoir des m\u00eames exceptions) que si le transport avait eu lieu le jour de sa signification, \u00e0 savoir le 27 mars 1924. Jusque-l\u00e0, pour Legault et pour Lamy, le cr\u00e9ancier \u00e9tait Chauret; le paiement \u00e0 Chauret e\u00fbt lib\u00e9r\u00e9 Lamy (art. 1572 C.C.); \u00e0 cette date, l\u2019obligation de Lamy \u00e9tait envers Chauret, et toute extinction de la cr\u00e9ance due \u00e0 Chauret devait profiter \u00e0 Lamy, car le paiement n\u2019est que l\u2019une des mani\u00e8res par laquelle l\u2019obligation s\u2019\u00e9teint (art. 1138 C.C.). Tout autre mode d\u2019extinction de la cr\u00e9ance op\u00e9rant entre Chauret et Legault ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la signification doit logiquement avoir le m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat. C\u2019est ainsi, par exemple, que\nle d\u00e9biteur peut opposer au cessionnaire la compensation de tout ce que lui devait le c\u00e9dant avant la signification du transport. (Pothier, vol, 3, n\u00b0 558).\nIl s\u2019agit donc de savoir si, avant la signification du transport, quelque chose s\u2019est produit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Chauret qui a eu l\u2019effet d\u2019\u00e9teindre la cr\u00e9ance.\nL\u2019adjudication par le sh\u00e9rif \u00e0 Chauret de l\u2019immeuble hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 en garantie de la cr\u00e9ance, que Chauret a c\u00e9d\u00e9e \u00e0 Boyer, a eu lieu le 4 octobre 1923.\nQuoique l\u2019adjudication ne soit parfaite que par le paiement du prix (art. 778 C.P.C), ce n\u2019en est pas moins une vente avec condition suspensive. (Voir ce que dit M. le juge Allard, Re The St. Catherines Realty Company v. Loranger[4]; aussi Bacon v. Insurance Company of North America[5], ainsi que les autorit\u00e9s auxquelles il y est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9). Du moment que la condition est accomplie, elle a un effet r\u00e9troactif (art. 1085 C.C.) et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est transf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 compter de la date de l\u2019adjudication (art. 778 C.P.C.).\u2019 L\u2019adjudicataire doit le paiement du prix. L\u2019article 747 C.P.C. dit en toutes lettres:\u2014\nToute offre ou ench\u00e8re comporte rengagement d\u2019acheter la chose au prix offert, sous la condition qu\u2019il ne surviendra aucune ench\u00e8re valable.\nL\u2019adjudicataire doit payer dans les trois jours le prix, ou la balance du prix, de son adjudication, d\u00e9lai apr\u00e8s lequel il est tenu aux int\u00e9r\u00eats (art. 758 C.P.C.).\nJusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la vente \u00e0 la folle ench\u00e8re soit effectu\u00e9e, l\u2019adjudicataire peut l\u2019\u00e9viter en consignant entre des mains du sh\u00e9rif, avant la vente, le prix de son adjudication, avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats depuis cette adjudication, etc. (art. 764 C.P.C.).\nLe fol ench\u00e9risseur est tenu des int\u00e9r\u00eats (art. 765 C.P.C).\nIl s\u2019agit donc bien d\u2019une vente entre le sh\u00e9rif et l\u2019adjudicataire, bien qu\u2019elle soit soumise par le code de proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 certaines r\u00e8gles sp\u00e9ciales.\nNe nous demandons pas si tous les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s pourraient s\u2019entendre pour contraindre l\u2019adjudicataire \u00e0 prendre son titre de vente, puisque ce n\u2019est pas le cas qui se pr\u00e9sente ici. La loi dit que, sur d\u00e9faut de l\u2019adjudicataire de payer son prix d\u2019acquisition en entier, le saisissant peut demander que\nl\u2019immeuble dont le prix est ainsi d\u00fb soit revendu \u00e0 la folle ench\u00e8re de l\u2019adjudicataire d\u00e9faillant (art. 761 C.P.C.).\nC\u2019est ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans le cas actuel. Il ne s\u2019ensuit pas, suivant nous, que l\u2019adjudicataire a cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9biteur du montant de son ench\u00e8re; encore moins qu\u2019il n\u2019en ait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 le d\u00e9biteur. Les diff\u00e9rents articles que nous avons cit\u00e9s et l\u2019ensemble du chapitre sur l\u2019ex\u00e9cution forc\u00e9e des jugements d\u00e9montrent le contraire.\nMais il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire que la loi pourv\u00fbt \u00e0 une m\u00e9thode exp\u00e9ditive de transformer en argent les immeubles saisis. En mati\u00e8re de meubles, le prix d\u2019adjudication doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9 sur-le-champ (art. 662 C.P.C.). En mati\u00e8re d\u2019immeubles, on a donn\u00e9 un certain d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur; mais, en m\u00eame temps, on a voulu mettre \u00e0 la disposition des parties une proc\u00e9dure rapide pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 un d\u00e9faut possible de l\u2019adjudicataire (arts. 761, 762, 763 C.P.C.). Par le fait qu\u2019on y a recours, on ne lib\u00e8re pas l\u2019adjudicataire de son obligation de payer. Il obtient tout simplement cr\u00e9dit pour le montant produit par la revente effective (art. 765 C.P.C). Il est responsable des int\u00e9r\u00eats, des frais et des dommages; et il reste d\u00e9biteur du montant de son ench\u00e8re, d\u00e9duction faite de celui de la vente d\u00e9finitive, \u201csi celui-ci est inf\u00e9rieur\u201d.\nCe n\u2019est pas au sh\u00e9rif qu\u2019il doit cette somme. Le sh\u00e9rif ne saurait \u00eatre que le d\u00e9positaire ou l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire. La somme est due aux cr\u00e9anciers judiciaires et au saisi (art. 765 C.P.C.). Dans une action hypoth\u00e9caire comme celle de Wilson v. Robin le saisi est le curateur au d\u00e9laissement qui, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, repr\u00e9sentait Legault, le d\u00e9biteur personnel. C\u2019est bien, en effet, la chose de Legault qui devait payer la cr\u00e9ance de Chauret. Le montant de l\u2019ench\u00e8re de Chauret n\u2019est rien autre qu\u2019une somme d\u2019argent substitu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019immeuble sur lequel cette cr\u00e9ance \u00e9tait hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9e. Chauret a pris l\u2019engagement (art. 747 C.P.C.) de verser entre les mains du sh\u00e9rif la somme de $34,000. Dans l\u2019ordre ordinaire des choses, il devait lui remettre cette somme, qui serait rest\u00e9e d\u00e9pos\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le jugement de distribution e\u00fbt d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 qui elle devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9e. Les collocations eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9es par le protonotaire conform\u00e9ment aux certificats des hypoth\u00e8ques. Nous supposons, pour les besoins de l\u2019argument, que l\u2019ench\u00e8re de $34,000 e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisante pour couvrir la somme de $5,000 qui fait l\u2019objet du pr\u00e9sent litige. Cette cr\u00e9ance e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 colloqu\u00e9e dans le bordereau de distribution et e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e et \u00e9teinte \u00e0 m\u00eame le montant de $34,000 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par Chauret.\nChauret n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 cette somme; mais, par son ench\u00e8re et par son adjudication, il en est devenu responsable. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi, c\u2019est lui qui la doit. Encore \u00e0 l\u2019heure qu\u2019il est, il en est le d\u00e9biteur. Si Lamy f\u00fbt appel\u00e9 \u00e0 la payer, il aurait son recours l\u00e9gal pour s\u2019en faire rembourser par Chauret ou sa succession (il s\u2019agit ici, bien entendu, de la question de droit et non de la possibilit\u00e9 de se faire payer). Or, s\u2019il est exact de dire, comme nous l\u2019avons conclu, qu\u2019au moment de l\u2019adjudication (qui s\u2019est op\u00e9r\u00e9e avant la signification par Boyer \u00e0 Legault) Chauret \u00e9tait alors le v\u00e9ritable cr\u00e9ancier de Legault et le seul propri\u00e9taire de la cr\u00e9ance \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de Legault, Chauret d\u00e8s lors est devenu le garant de Legault et de Lamy et il s\u2019est donc mis dans la position o\u00f9 Lamy pourrait lui r\u00e9clamer la somme que Boyer demande actuellement par son action.\nIl est \u00e9vident que, dans ces conditions, Chauret ne pourrait poursuivre ni Legault, ni Lamy. Il s\u2019ensuit que Boyer, qui n\u2019a acquis le 27 mars 1924 (jour de la signification) que le droit que Chauret poss\u00e9dait, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas recevable dans l\u2019action qu\u2019il a intent\u00e9e contre Lamy.\nEn effet, de la clause de garantie de fournir et faire valoir, comme nous le disions au commencement en nous appuyant sur l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de Pothier (Vente, nos 564 et 565), il est n\u00e9 une action de recours contre Lamy, mais cette action s\u2019est \u00e9teinte en la personne de Chauret lorsqu\u2019il est devenu responsable du paiement de la somme garantie, ou en quelque sorte garant de sa propre cr\u00e9ance.\nIl n\u2019est pas recevable \u00e0 se plaindre que la (cr\u00e9ance) a cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre bonne, puisque c\u2019est par son fait qu\u2019elle a cess\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00eatre.\nCette conclusion, que l\u2019on trouve dans Pothier (vol. 3, p. 565) et qui s\u2019accorde avec l\u2019article 1959 C.C., se retrouve \u00e9galement dans le passage suivant de Baudry-Lacantinerie (De la vente et de l\u2019\u00e9change, 3e \u00e9d. n\u00b0 838):\u2014\nSi le cessionnaire perd son recours en garantie contre le c\u00e9dant, lorsqu\u2019il a laiss\u00e9 le d\u00e9biteur c\u00e9d\u00e9 devenir insolvable, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de poursuites en temps utile, \u00e0 plus forte raison le perdrait-il si l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir le paiement de la cr\u00e9ance provenait d\u2019un fait actif qui lui serait propre ou m\u00eame d\u2019une n\u00e9gligence qui aurait fait perdre les s\u00fbret\u00e9s attach\u00e9es \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ance, par exemple, s\u2019il avait donn\u00e9 mainlev\u00e9e d\u2019une inscription hypoth\u00e9caire qui assurait le paiement de la cr\u00e9ance ou s\u2019il l\u2019avait laiss\u00e9e p\u00e9rimer, s\u2019il avait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que ou d\u00e9charg\u00e9 une caution solvable qui avait garanti le paiement, ou remis un gage qui l\u2019assurait. Dans ces cas, le cessionnaire perdrait son recours, m\u00eame contre le c\u00e9dant qui aurait promis de payer l\u00e0 d\u00e9faut du d\u00e9biteur.\nTout le raisonnement qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de cependant est bas\u00e9, comme nous l\u2019avons indiqu\u00e9, sur la supposition que la cr\u00e9ance de $5,000 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e de Chauret \u00e0 Boyer et maintenant r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par rayant-cause de ce dernier, e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e \u00e0 m\u00eame l\u2019ench\u00e8re de $34,000, si Chauret, comme il le devait, en e\u00fbt d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le montant entre les mains du sh\u00e9rif.\nCela d\u00e9pend de ce qu\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 le jugement de distribution qui aurait fait suite \u00e0 l\u2019adjudication \u00e0 Chauret. Les chiffres qui nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis lors de l\u2019argumentation devant cette cour semblent d\u00e9montrer que la somme de $5,000 e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 couverte par le montant de cette ench\u00e8re. D\u2019autre part, M. le juge Dorion, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le calcul approximatif qu\u2019il a fait en Cour du Banc du Roi, pense qu\u2019il aurait pu subsister un d\u00e9ficit. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, les parties ne se sont pas appliqu\u00e9es \u00e0 \u00e9tablir ce r\u00e9sultat de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 en faire une d\u00e9monstration absolument satisfaisante et qui ne laisse planer aucun doute.\nLe juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure ne s\u2019est pas prononc\u00e9 l\u00e0-dessus parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u2019avis, pour les raisons qu\u2019il donne dans son jugement, que Lamy \u00e9tait responsable \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e8nement. L\u2019instance a tourn\u00e9 principalement autour des questions de droit; et les parties ne se sont pas appliqu\u00e9es \u00e0 fournir ou \u00e0 discuter de part et d\u2019autre les donn\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires pour reconstituer les collocations qui auraient figur\u00e9 dans le rapport de distribution, tel qu\u2019il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 fait apr\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re adjudication. Nous croyons donc que justice sera, mieux rendue en adoptant la suggestion de M. le juge Dorion que le dossier soit retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour y\nfaire \u00e9tablir quel e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 le jugement de distribution du montant de l\u2019ench\u00e8re de Chauret.\nS\u2019il est alors d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la cr\u00e9ance de $5,000 e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 colloqu\u00e9e en entier, l\u2019intim\u00e9e devra \u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9e de son action. Dans le cas contraire, l\u2019action devra \u00eatre maintenue jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de toute partie de la cr\u00e9ance de $5,000 qui n\u2019e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 colloqu\u00e9e sur le jugement de distribution.\nLes frais de l\u2019action en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure devront suivre le sort de la cause. Mais l\u2019appelant r\u00e9ussit sur les questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battues devant nous, et il a droit \u00e0 ses frais tant devant cette cour que devant la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Dorais & Dorais.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Patenaude, Mouette, Filion & Boyer.\n[1] (1926) Q.R. 41 K.B. 9.\n[2] (1901) Q.R. 11 K.B. 251, at pp. 266, 275; (1903) A.C. 59, at p. 67.\n[3] (1903) A.C. 59.\n[4] (1917) 19 Q.P.R. 307, at pp. 311 et suiv.\n[5] (1914) Q.R. 47 S. c. 74, at p. 76.\n",

(R.S.M., 1913, c. 46)\u2014Surety\u2019s obligation undertaken on terms that note be used only for advances by a bank and for advances to a certain required amount\u2014Non-fulfilment of terms\u2014Release of surety\u2014Creditor\u2019s obligation as to application of payments.\nPlaintiff took a promissory note as collateral security for advances by him to L. Co., which note had been endorsed by defendant G. As found by the court, G. had endorsed the note on the terms and conditions, known to plaintiff, that it would be delivered as collateral security to a bank for a loan to be made by the bank to L. Co. of $10,000, in five advances of $2,000 each, to be used for payment of agreed upon instalments to L. Co\u2019s. creditors, and that repayment was to be secured by an assignment to the bank of whatever government ditching contracts L. Co. might secure in 1923. Plaintiff hypothecated the note to his bank, by a general hypothecation in the bank\u2019s usual form, as collateral to his own account with his bank.\nHeld, that the case, on the evidence, if not falling within the class of \u201cthose in which there is an agreement to constitute, for a particular purpose, the relation of principal and surety, to which agreement the creditor is a party,\u201d at least fell within the class of \u201cthose in which there is a similar agreement between the principal and surety only, to which the creditor is a stranger.\u201d In a case of the latter class the surety has against the debtor the rights of a surety, and the creditor receiving notice of his claim to those rights, is not at liberty to do anything to their prejudice. (Duncan, Fox, & Co. v. North & South Wales Bank, 6 App. Cas. 1 at pp. 11, 12).\nHeld, further, that the effect of the plaintiff\u2019s hypothecation to his bank was to expose G. to be held liable to the bank, as holder in due course, to the extent of his ex facie obligation under his endorsement, not merely for whatever indebtedness of L. Co. he had undertaken to guarantee, but for any indebtedness of plaintiff to the bank; and this obvious alteration in G.\u2019s position involved a substantial extension of his responsibility which released him from liability to the plaintiff. The principle of Archer v. Hudson, 7 Beav. 551, and other cases cited applied.\nPlaintiff\u2019s unsupported testimony by which he sought to modify or restrict the plain meaning and effect of his general hypothecation to the bank, was wholly inadmissible and ineffectual. (Forman v. Union Trust Co. [1927] S.C.R. 1).\nS. 26 (r) of The King\u2019s Bench Act, Man. (providing that \u201cgiving time to a principal debtor, or dealing with or altering the security held by the principal creditor, shall not of itself discharge a surety or guarantor * * *\u201d) did not apply. The security held by the creditor to which the enactment refers is not the obligation either of the debtor or of the surety, nor the instrument evidencing such obligation, but some other security held by the creditor for its performance Here the charge against the plaintiff was not that of having dealt in an unauthorized manner with any such security, but rather that he had so dealt with the very instrument evidencing the surety\u2019s contractual obligation itself.\nHeld, further, that the facts, known to plaintiff, that G. endorsed the note only for use as collateral to a bank, and would not have endorsed it had he known it was to be used for advances to be made by plaintiff, a money lender, vitiated G.\u2019s consent and prevented any obligation arising on his part in favour of the plaintiff. Smith v. Wheat-croft, 9 Ch. D. 223, at p. 230, and other authorities, cited.\nHeld, further, that as G. endorsed the note for the sole purpose of being used for a loan of $10,000 to be made in five advances of $2,000 each to L. Co., which advances were necessary to carry out an arrangement with creditors, the plaintiff, who knew these facts, by refusing and failing (as found by the court) to advance the final $2,000 promised, declined to fulfil an essential condition of G.\u2019s undertaking of his obligation of guarantor, and thereby discharged him from his liability. (Burton v. Gray, 8 Ch. App. 932; Whitcher v. Hall, 5 B. & C. 269, at p. 275).\nThe burden of proving that the note was to be a general continuing collateral security, as alleged by plaintiff, was on him. (In re Boys, L.R. 10, Eq. 467; Tatam v. Haslar, 23 Q.B.D. 345, at p. 348).\nFurther, the court was inclined to hold that, assuming that plaintiff could claim against G. for the $8,000 advanced on the note, the claim was satisfied, partly by certain payments, by his appropriation of which the plaintiff was bound, and partly by a payment on a Government contract obtained by L. Co. and assigned to plaintiff. Though, as against L. Co., plaintiff might have a right to apply the payment received on the Government contract first against other moneys advanced to L. Co. to enable it to carry out that contract, yet he had no such right as against G. who was entitled to have his stipulation as to Government contract moneys (see first paragraph supra) carried out. (Newton v. Chorlton, 10 Hare, 646, at p. 653). Failure to apply these moneys as stipulated for by the surety would amount to a variation in the contract which would release him. (Can. Bank of Commerce v. Swanson, 33 Man. R. 127; Pearl v. Deacon, 1 DeG. & J., 461). APPEAL by the defendant Gordon from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, which, reversing the judgment of Galt J., held him liable to the plaintiff in the sum of $11,401.03 and costs. The plaintiff\u2019s claim against the said defendant was as endorser, and guarantor of payment, of a promissory note held by the plaintiff, dated 8th November, 1922, and delivered to the plaintiff on the 4th December, 1922, made by the defendant the Lount Engineering Co. Ltd., in favour of the defendant Lount, and endorsed by him and by the defendant (appellant) Gordon and by the defendant Lyon. The note was a demand note for $10,000 payable at the Royal Bank of Canada, Winnipeg, with interest at 8 per cent, per annum as well after as before maturity. The facts of the case and the questions in dispute are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed.\nE. Lafleur K.C. and E. D. Honeyman for the appellant.\nW. L. Scott K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The evidence presents this case as falling either within the first or the second of the three classes of suretyship defined by Lord Chancellor Selborne in Duncan, Fox & Co. v. North & South Wales Bank[1]. If not, as seems most probable, within the first class, namely\nthose in which there is an agreement to constitute, for a particular purpose, the relation of principal and surety, to which agreement the creditor a party,\nit is, at least, within the second class, thus defined by His Lordship;\nthose in which there is a similar agreement between the principal and surety only, to which the creditor is a stranger.\nOf a surety of the latter class the Lord Chancellor says (p. 12) that he has against the debtor\nthe rights of a surety; and that the creditor receiving notice of his claim to those rights, will not be at liberty to do anything to their prejudice.\nThe evidence establishes express notice to the respondent of the appellant\u2019s position as a surety and guarantor for the Lount Engineering Company\u2014the debtor\u2014and of the terms and conditions on which that position was assumed by him.\nThe law affecting the relations of creditor and surety is materially modified in the Province of Manitoba by s. 26 (r) of The King\u2019s Bench Act, R.S.M., 1913, c. 46:\u2014\nGiving time to a principal debtor, or dealing with or altering the security held by the principal creditor shall not of itself discharge a surety or guarantor; in such case a surety shall be entitled to set up such giving of time or dealing with or alteration of the security as a defence, but it shall be allowed only in so far as it shall be shown that the surety has thereby been prejudiced.\nBecause it introduces a new principle in derogation of the ordinary legal rights of a surety this statute must be taken to alter the law only in so far as its terms clearly express legislative intent to do so. The security held by the creditor to which the enactment refers is not the obligation either of the debtor or of the surety nor the instrument evidencing such obligation, but some other security held by the creditor for its performance. Here the charge against the respondent is not that of having dealt in an unauthorized manner with any such security, but rather that he has so dealt with the very instrument evidencing the surety\u2019s contractual obligation itself. Except in the case of merely giving time to the principal debtor, nothing in the section under consideration interferes with the legal effect of a variation in the contractual obligation either of the debtor or of the surety effected without the surety\u2019s assent and any such change (not obviously unsubstantial) resulting from the action of the creditor will still discharge the surety in Manitoba as it does in other provinces where English law prevails. Holme v. Brunskill[2].\nIt is common ground that the promissory note, on which the appellant is sued as endorser and in respect to which he held, to the knowledge, and probably by the agreement, of the respondent, the position of a surety, was given to, and taken by, the respondent as collateral security either for a specific part (according to the appellant\u2019s contention) or for the whole (according to the contention of the respondent) of the indebtedness of the Lount Engineering Company to the respondent. That note was, nevertheless, hypothecated by the respondent to the Royal Bank of Canada, by a general hypothecation in the bank\u2019s usual form, as collateral to his own account with the bank. The respondent admittedly had a large \u201cline of credit\u201d with the Royal Bank which was, at times, drawn against to its limit. The effect of the hypothecation was to expose the appellant to be held liable to the bank, as holder in due course, to the extent of his ex facie obligation under his endorsement, not merely for whatever indebtedness of the Lount Engineering Company he had undertaken to guarantee, but for any indebtedness of the respondent to the bank, which might, of course, be entirely disconnected with the Lount Engineering Company. The unsupported testimony of the respondent by which he sought to modify or restrict the plain meaning and effect of this general hypothecation to the bank was wholly inadmissible and ineffectual. Forman v. Union Trust Co.[3]. This obvious alteration in the surety\u2019s position involved a substantial extension of his responsibility which, in our opinion, released him from liability to the respondent. Such a case is not within s.26 (r) of the Manitoba King\u2019s Bench Act, R.S.M. 1913, c. 46. The principle of the following decisions applies: Archer v. Hudson[4]; Pybus v. Gibb[5]; Finch v. Jukes[6]; Newton v. Chorlton[7]. See too Bank of Montreal v. Normandin[8].\nWhile this appeal might be disposed of on the short ground above stated, we think it proper to rest our judgment for the appellant as well on other grounds subjoined. Other variations in the contract of the principal debtor\u2014(1) by charging bonuses on advances which made the rates of interest exorbitant\u2014well over 100 per cent, per annum on an eight months\u2019 basis of credit in the case of the first advance and over 75 per cent, in the case of the two later advances (\u201cpayment accordingly\u201d; vide infra) \u2014and (2) providing for interest at 20 per cent, on the notes finally taken to cover the balances due by the company, are also invoked by the appellant as grounds for release. But no specified rate of interest to be paid by the principal debtor on its borrowings would seem to have been stipulated for by the surety; and the 20 per cent, rate on the last notes taken does not appear to have been pleaded as a ground for discharge. We accordingly do not treat these variations, if they be such, as entitling the appellant to relief. Yet, while they may not serve as specific grounds of defence, these excessive interest charges imposed by the respondent make very clear the materiality to the appellant of his understanding (hereinafter dealt with) that he was guaranteeing the repayment of advances to be made by a bank and not by a note-shaving money-lender.\nThe respondent\u2019s testimony is unsatisfactory and cannot be relied upon when in conflict with that of other witnesses. This seems to have been the view of the learned trial judge; upon it he rejected the respondent\u2019s story as to the purpose for which the note in suit was taken by him; and a careful study of the record discloses that that view of Galt J. was fully justified.\nWhile some of the testimony of the defence witnesses, Lount, Lyon, Williams and Gordon, detailing conversations between themselves in the absence of the plaintiff, may have been improperly received, there is enough admissible evidence to establish that the appellant Gordon endorsed the $10,000 note sued on upon the distinct understanding\n(a) that it would be delivered as collateral security to a bank for advances to be made by the bank to the Lount Engineering Company;\n(b) that it was to be collateral security only for a loan of $10,000, to be made in five advances of $2,000 each, to the Lount Engineering Company, and to be used for the payment of agreed upon instalments to its creditors;\n(c) that repayment of these advances was to be secured by an assignment to the bank of whatever ditching contracts the debtor company might secure during the year 1923 from the Manitoba Government.\nThe respondent denies knowledge that the obligation undertaken by the appellant was subject to these terms and insists that the note sued on was handed to him by Lount, secretary of the Engineering Company, as a general and continuing collateral security for any indebtedness which that company might incur to him and that he took the note without notice of any restriction affecting Lount\u2019s right so to use it.\n(a) That both the appellant Gordon and his solicitor McWilliams were insistent with Lount that the note should be used to enable the company to borrow from a bank and that studied and successful efforts were made by Lount to conceal from Dr. Gordon that advances to the Lount Engineering Company were to be obtained not from a bank, but from the respondent, is made very clear in the evidence,\nLount says that Hebblewhite knew that his interest in the matter was being concealed from Dr. Gordon\u2014that he told Hebblewhite that \u201cwe could not get Mr. McWilliams to recommend that Dr. Gordon go on the note unless the money were to be procured from the bank.\u201d This is, of course, denied by the respondent. The note now sued upon bears stamped above the endorsements of Lount, Lyon and Gordon the words: \u201cPay to the order of the Winnipeg Financial Corporation\u201d (the respondent\u2019s business name) and below these endorsements, but above a second set of the same signatures, the words stamped: \u201cI hereby waive protest, notice of protest and presentation of the within note and guarantee payment of the same.\u201d The respondent swore that both these stampings were put on the back of the note when he drew it up, according, he says, to his usual custom. His evidence when first given was rather in the nature of an inference from that custom than of art act of remembrance; but, when recalled in rebuttal he swore he positively remembered this fact; whereupon the learned trial judge significantly observed that he had become more explicit. It is abundantly proved that the firsts or upper, stamping was not on the note when endorsed by Dr. Gordon, whereas the second, or lower, stamping was then upon it; and, in view of the respondent\u2019s evidence as to his \u201cpolicy\u201d of putting these stampings on all his notes when preparing them for signature, these incidents are most significant and strongly corroborative of Lount\u2019s statement that the respondent was fully cognizant of\u2014 indeed they suggest that he actively connived in\u2014the concealment from Dr. Gordon of the fact that Hebblewhite was to be given the $10,000 note as collateral for advances to be made by him to the company. There can be no doubt that Hebblewhite was fully aware, when he took the $10,000 note, that Dr. Gordon had endorsed it only for use as collateral at a bank and that he would not have endorsed it had he known that it was to be used for advances to be made by Hebblewhite. The identity, in the sense of the character, of the person to whom he was to contract an obligation as endorser was so material as an inducement to Dr. Gordon that mistake as to it vitiated his eon-sent and prevented any obligation arising on his part in favour of Hebblewhite. Smith v. Wheateroft[9]; Said v. Butt[10]; Pothier, Traite des Obligations, s. 19; Gordon v. Street[11]; Cundy v. Lindsay[12]. If such a mistake as to person so induced will preclude an effective consent in the case of an ordinary contract, a fortiori must it do so in the case of a contract strictissimi juris, as is that of guarantee. Owen v. Homan[13].\n(b) The sole purpose of the giving of the $10,000 note as collateral security was, to the knowledge of the respondent, to enable the Lount Engineering Company to carry out an agreement made with its creditors, whose claims aggregated some $50,000, whereby they agreed in consideration of the receipt of certain instalments, aggregating $2,000 monthly for five months, not to enforce the balances of their claims for a year. To carry out this arrangement $10,000 was necessary; no smaller sum would suffice. All this was fully explained by Lount to the respondent, who, at first, asked for a collateral note of $15,000 or $20,000, but, when told that Dr. Gordon would not endorse for more than $10,000, agreed to accept a note for the latter sum, telling Lount, not that he would have to take a smaller advance, but \u201cthat he would have to pay accordingly.\u201d And \u201caccordingly\u201d bonuses of $2,500 on the first advance of $4,000 and of $1,000 apiece on each of the two later advances of $2,000 were charged. The burden of proving that the $10,000 note was to be a general continuing collateral security was on the plaintiff: In re Boys[14]; Tatam v. Haslar[15].\nLount deposes:\u2014\n* * * I spoke to Mr. Hebblewhite about getting the money, and he demanded that in addition to the order for any works which we might procure from the Provincial Government, that I get a collateral note signed by the other directors, as a further security for this loan.\nQ. Did Mr. Hebblewhite, prior to the date of Exhibit No. 1, ask you to obtain from your co-defendant directors a collateral note for some $15,000 or $20,000?\u2014A. When I went to Mr. Hebblewhite for the money he said that he would like a note of that size. I told him that it would be utterly impossible to get it, and he suggested $10,000, and I then endeavoured to get it.\nQ. What did you say to him? Did you tell him how much money you wanted?\u2014A. Yes. We had a table prepared\u2014in fact we had taken it up with the creditors, and got letters from them, stating that on receipt of a proportion of it\u2014the indebtedness of the company to them\u2014which would amount to about $10,000, that they would withhold any action until the fall of 1923. I told Mr. Hebblewhite I thought that it would be impossible to get such a note. However, he insisted that he could not make the loan without it.\nQ. You say that you told him as to the amount of money which you required for the purpose of satisfying the creditors of the defendant company, and that Mr. Hebblewhite insisted that you should get a note for the $10,000 that you required, endorsed by the other two directors of the company, Mr. John N. Lyon and Dr. C. W. Gordon, and you told him that you thought that it would be impossible to get such a note?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Did you tell him why?\u2014A. I pointed out that they were not receiving any good\u2014benefit\u2014from the proposition, and, further, that Mr. McWilliams was very much averse to Dr. Gordon going on * * * I pointed out to Mr. Hebblewhite that Mr. R. F. McWilliams, who was acting for Dr. Gordon, seemed very much averse to the doctor going on any further with any guarantees whatever. However, I couldn\u2019t get the loan without this and, finally, after preparing a statement showing how we were going to spend the money, Mr. McWilliams authorized Dr. Gordon to take such a step.\n* * *\nQ. You had some discussion with Mr. Hebblewhite as to how the loan he was making should be returned?\u2014A. Yes. It was to be made in five monthly payments of $2,000 each for four months, with the understanding that it be renewed for a like amount.\nQ. You say that you had some discussion with Mr. Hebblewhite as to how the loan he was making was to be returned\u2014repaid\u2014and it was to be made in five monthly payments of $2,000 each, for four months, with the understanding that it be renewed for a like amount?\u2014A. Yes, for a like period. That would bring it into the operating period of the dredge, from which we expected to pay it back. We expected a large Government contract. His Lordship: The $10,000 to be advanced?\u2014A. Yes. Q. Not all at once?\u2014A. Of $2,000 per month, and that would extend the time of repayment into the operating period of the summer months of the machine, and we expected to get a large ditching contract from the Government, out of which we were going to pay this money back, and the contractors are paid in (by) monthly instalments by the Government.\nMr. Honeyman: Did you explain to Mr. Hebblewhite out of what fund the advance could be repaid?\u2014A. Yes. It was to be repaid out of the ditching work.\nQ. I show you Exhibit No. 36. You signed that document, I understand?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. That is a letter addressed to the Winnipeg Financial Corporation, dated the first of December, 1922, which reads as follows:\n\u201cWe hereby agree, upon being awarded a contract, or contracts, from the Manitoba Government, to give you an order on them, authorizing the Government to pay direct to you, all estimates for work performed. We agree to make this order read that it shall remain in force until cancelled by you, or the account is liquidated.\n\u201cWe further certify that we have received a letter from each creditor, stating that upon receipt of certain small payments, which have been arranged, the balance will be carried until dates ranging from October 1, to November 30, 1923.\u201d\nHis Lordship: It was not carried out that way, because you got $4,000 on the note?\u2014A. That was arranged because we had arranged to pay the creditors that payment in November on negotiations direct as to these small payments, and we were able (sic) to do it, and, consequently, we were made two payments, and two more (payments) were carried out, and the fifth was not made.\nHis Lordship: There were some other monthly payments?\u2014A. Yes.\nMr. Honeyman: Q. How did you come to sign Exhibit No. 36, which I have just read to you?\u2014A. Well, we had agreed to do that; the negotiations were practically through, and I gave Mr. Hebblewhite that letter.\n* * *\nThe Witness: I told Mr. McWilliams that I would be getting the money through a bank.\nMr. Honeyman: Q. Mr. Lyon was there?\u2014A. Yes; I didn\u2019t say anything about the Winnipeg Financial Corporation.\nHis Lordship: He didn\u2019t know anything about the Winnipeg Financial Corporation?\u2014A. No; he knew nothing.\nMr. Honeyman: Q. Did you tell Mr. McWilliams how the repayment of the moneys was to be secured to the lender?\u2014A. On the Government contract for ditching, which we expected to get.\nQ. Did you tell him what amount had been arranged for\u2014what amount?\u2014A. Yes, $10,000, $2,000 a month.\nQ. And that was to be repayable how?\u2014A. That was to be repaid out of the ditching work.\nQ. On what terms, and at what times?\u2014A. Well, in eight months from the time that the payments were made, so that it would go into the payments that we would be receiving.\nHis Lordship: Q. These notes were to be at what length of time?\u2014A. Four months, and renewable for four months.\nMr. Honeyman: You say that you didn\u2019t say anything of Mr. Hebblewhite?\u2014A. No, certainly I did not. Q. Why?\u2014A. Well, I didn\u2019t think the loan would go through and the company needed it very badly, I concealed that fact.\nQ. Mr. Lyon was present when you met Mr. McWilliams, and when you told him that?\u2014A, Yes.\nHis Lordship: Did he know anything about Mr. Hebblewhite?\u2014A. I think not, my lord.\n* * *\nMr. Honeyman: Q. Under what terms did you give that $10,000 note to Mr. Hebblewhite?\u2014A. As a collateral security to the advances that he was to make. He was to advance $10,000 at the rate of $2,000 a month. He had at that time received an order, or assignment, of any work that we might get, or any contract we might get, and I gave a note for $6,500 I think, and received the first two months (advances) in advance.\nHis Lordship: He was to advance the whole $10,000?\u2014A. Yes.\nMr. Honeyman: In January what happened?\u2014A. Mr. Hebblewhite made the next advance of $2,000.\nQ. And took a note for $3,000?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. That note is already in?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. In February what happened?\u2014A. He made a further advance of $2,000.\nQ. Through the note which is already filed, for $3,000?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. In March what happened?\u2014A. He stated\u2014\nQ. You saw Mr. Hebblewhite in March?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. What for?\u2014A. To get the $2,000 to hold the final promise to the creditors.\nQ. About what time in March was it?\u2014A. I can\u2019t say that definitely. I presume it was around the first, as usual, though.\nQ. What did he say then?\u2014A. He said that he didn\u2019t have sufficient security to make the advance, and he couldn\u2019t do so\nQ. What did you say to that?\u2014A. I pointed out that it was disastrous to us; that we had entered into an arrangement, and certainly we would be in a very bad shape if we didn\u2019t make the final payment to our creditors.\nQ. What did he say?\u2014A. Well, he had to have further security, or another note from Dr. Gordon, and I knew that that was utterly impossible to get it.\n* * *\nQ. When you were negotiating with Mr. Hebblewhite in the Fall of 1922 for the loan of $10,000, was there a discussion respecting other advances which he might have to make?\u2014A. No. We believed that that contract would put us on our feet.\nQ. Was there a discussion in the Fall of 1922, when the note in question, Exhibit No. 1, was being arranged, concerning your building contract, a building contract of the company, in the spring of 1923?\u2014A. Do you mean the houses?\nQ. Yes.\u2014A. No.\nQ. You heard what Mr. Hebblewhite said in respect of the note, Exhibit No. 1, being given to him as a collateral continuing security for all advances to be made by the company to him?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. What do you say as to that?\u2014A. There was no question of a continuing security. We were getting a loan of $10,000, which, as far as I was concerned, was to be the final loan.\nQ. What would you say as to Mr. Hebblewhite\u2019s statement that he did not agree to loan any specified sum at all to you when you left the collateral note with you (him), and that he would only do what financing he could at the bank on it?\u2014A. I don\u2019t recollect that statement. We went ahead on the basis of getting $10,000 to hold off our creditors.\n* * *\nQ. Did you ever get the last $2,000 upon the $10,000 advance from Mr. Hebblewhite, upon the security of the collateral note?\u2014A. Not on the original security, no.\nQ. Have you had any discussion with Mr. Hebblewhite subsequent to the handing over of Exhibit No. 1, the collateral note for $10,000, as to its being used for security for other advances?\u2014A. No.\nQ. When did you first learn that Mr. Hebblewhite was claiming that this note in question (Ex. No. 1) was given as security for all advances made the company?\u2014A. After this action was started.\nQ. Up to that time what had you thought?\u2014A. I hadn\u2019t thought anything about it. It was put up originally for the one guarantee.\nQ. For the one guarantee of what?\u2014A. $10,000.\nQ. Of which how much was advanced?\u2014A. $8,000.\n* * *\nQ. How did you come to sign Exhibit No. 13?\u2014A. According to the agreement that we made with Mr. Hebblewhite when he advanced us the $10,000, or agreed to advance it.\nQ. That is, in accordance with the letter of December 1, you mean, is it?\u2014A. Yes (Ex. No. 36). Yes. We had given a letter at the time we got, or about the time we got, the advance, that assignment of any contracts that we got.\nQ. Exhibit No. 36 is the letter that you refer to?\u2014A. Yes.\n* * *\nQ. In the fall of 1922, when you were discussing the collateral note with Mr. Hebblewhite, what outstanding accounts were there in connection with building accounts?\u2014A. There were no outstanding accounts in connection with houses.\nQ. What did you tell Mr. Hebblewhite about building in the summer of 1923?\u2014A. I have no recollection of discussing housing operations at all. We were counting on the ditching work-\nQ. How did you know that there was going to be a ditch built\u2014did you tell Mr. Hebblewhite?\u2014A. Oh, yes, we knew it. It was in the papers as well that this work was coming up.\nQ. And you were anticipating getting it?\u2014A. Yes; we certainly did.\nQ. If you had got it, what building would you have done in 1923?\u2014 A. The ditching contract was very large and it would have taken up every moment I had. It was \u201csome size.\u201d\nWhile the respondent, on every opportunity and although not at all responsively to the question put to him, interjects the statement that the $10,000 note was given and taken as continuing collateral to the general indebtedness of the Lount Engineering Company to himself, not a little corroboration of Mr. Lount\u2019s evidence to the contrary, and as to the actual bargain made, is to be found in the following passages from Hebblewhite\u2019s testimony:\u2014\nMr. Honeyman: Q. The only sum which Lount wanted you to advance, when he came to you in the fall of 1922, was the $10,000 which he required to pay off his past due debts with certain creditors. Isn\u2019t that so? And isn\u2019t that correct?\u2014A. That was all for the moment, yes. Q. You didn\u2019t discuss advancing any further sums either, did you, at that time?\u2014A. I can\u2019t just remember. I think there was some little discussion at that time, and I think the housing scheme was discussed at that time. I am not sure about that, of course. Q. You advanced $8,000?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. In December, January and February of 1922, 1923, that is, is it not?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And you say that Mr. Lount came to you in March and asked you for the final $2,000, did he not?\u2014A. Yes,\u2014he couldn\u2019t. There was no such arrangement made, and I couldn\u2019t undertake to guarantee to give him the money, when I had to look to the bank for the money.\nQ. Didn\u2019t he ask you for $2,000 in March?\u2014A. Yes; he asked me for $2,000 in March, and I refused to give it to him.\n* * *\nHis Lordship: I would like to know what the bargain was first of all. A man doesn\u2019t hand over a note for $10,000 you know, without there being some arrangement about it?\nMr. Thomson: Q. What was the arrangement\u2014what was your arrangement with regard to the matter?\u2014A. The arrangement was, when Mr. Lount told me that he could not induce one of the endorsers, Dr. Gordon, to endorse a note for $15,000 or $20,000, but thought that he could arrange for a note for $10,000 and when he made that statement to me I informed him that he would have to pay accordingly. And he subsequently brought in a note for $10,000, with interest at eight per cent (8%) signed (Exhibit No. 1) by the defendant company, by himself personally, and endorsed by Mr. John N. Lyon * * *\nQ. Why was it\u2014the note in question\u2014made for $10,000?\u2014A. Because Lount couldn\u2019t obtain a note for any larger amount endorsed by the individual endorsers.\n* * *\nHis Lordship: They (the advances mentioned) were for the purposes of meeting the outstanding debts of the company at that time?\u2014A. Yes, to pay the pressing creditors of the company, and the money was used for that purpose.\nQ. The $4,000 was part of that?\u2014A. Yes, that was part of it. That was the first advance I made, and Mr. Lount pointed out to me that he would require about $2,000 a month. Why he wanted it in that way I, of course, did not know. It was satisfactory to him anyway.\n* * *\nQ. You say that in December, 1922, or November, 1922, when you were first approached by the defendant company for the loan out of which this transaction grew, there was no money owing to you by the defendant company, that all previous transactions had been cleaned up? \u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And Lount approached you for a loan for a certain purpose, did he not?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. He wanted money for the purpose of keeping the creditors quiet until next year, did he not?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And he required for that purpose, he told you, $10,000?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And he arranged with his creditors that certain sums be paid to them monthly?\u2014A. Yes. Q. And the total monthly payments to his creditors, in order to keep them quiet, totalled $2,000?\u2014A. That was his statement to me, yes.\nQ. He told you how he hoped to repay the $10,000 loan, which he required?\u2014A. From the profits of their business, which he hoped to be able to do.\nQ. During the year, or summer of 1923, the ensuing summer?\u2014A. Yes.\n* * *\nQ. When did you arrange that the $2,000 monthly advances which you were asking for, and which you did eventually get them to make from time to time, were to be repaid?\u2014A. It was to be repaid from any contracts which they undertook; there was no definite time set for that \u2014there couldn\u2019t be any, but Mr. Lount made the statement to the manager of the bank that he hoped to clean up all the notes under discount at the bank by the fall of 1923.\nQ. It was specifically mentioned at that time that there would be at least one renewal?\u2014A. No. Oh no. There was no such arrangement made in regard to one renewal at all, in regard to the payment of the notes. Mr. Lount understood that in regard to certain charges which were being made, that there would be no further charges in the next renewal.\nQ. Mr. Lount told you that he understood, that he believed, that they had fairly definite arrangements made whereby they would get large ditching contracts in the summer of 1923, did he not?\u2014A. He didn\u2019t put it as broadly as that. He hoped to get a contract in February, 1923, from the Provincial Government, which he did not get.\nQ. And it was evidently out of the profits that he would make out of the ditching that he hoped to pay you, he told you?\u2014A. Not only that, but any other contracts, any contracts from any other source from which they made their money.\nQ. There was no sum mentioned in the discussion about the ditching contracts, when you were discussing the amount of the loan of $10,000.\u2014 A. Nothing beyond the fact that he hoped to get this Government contract in February, 1923, which he did not get.\nQ. And you were going to be paid out of that?\u2014A. If he got the contract\u2014why not?\nQ. You took an assignment of his company\u2019s contracts with the Provincial Government at that time, did you not?\u2014A. I did.\nQ. Did you not take an agreement to assign?\u2014A. I did not. He gave me a letter, I think, stating that he would give me an assignment of any contracts that he got.\nQ. Before you got the note, Exhibit No. 1, which has been put in evidence here, you took this letter from the defendant company, did you not?\u2014A. Before making any advances to the defendant company I wished some assurance from them that I would get the orders, or the assignment against the work, and I wanted something definite on file.\n* * *\nQ. And you got it, the letter, before you got Exhibit No. 1 the note in question here, did you not?\u2014A. Yes\u2014I am not sure of that, of course. That was immaterial, anyway. All that I wanted was a letter and I wanted that assurance from Lount first, and I didn\u2019t care when I got it, but I was going to get it before I made any advances.\n* * * Mr. Honeyman: You have already told us, I think, that you got Exhibit No. 1 on the 4th of December, 1922.\u2014A. Yes. I received Exhibit No. 1 on the 4th day of December, 1922.\nHis Lordship: They must have put through an arrangement earlier, because it is dated the 8th of November, and your negotiations must have been going on all that time?\nThe Witness: Yes. They began in November, and it was then that he was afraid that he could not obtain Dr. Gordon\u2019s endorsement to the note, and that caused the delay, I understand.\nQ. You drew the note on or about the 8th of November, I think, 1922\u2014its date, I suppose, did you?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You gave it to Lount for what purpose?\u2014A. For the purpose of obtaining the endorsement of Mr. John N. Lyon and Dr. Gordon.\nQ. You asked him to get the endorsement of Dr. Gordon and Mr. Lyon to the note previously to that?\u2014A. Yes. Mr. Lount first suggested obtaining these endorsers, and I told him if he couldn\u2019t do any better that would be satisfactory.\nQ. Of course you knew that this note, Exhibit No. 1, would be endorsed as an accommodation note, endorsed as such by the two men mentioned\u2014Dr. C. W. Gordon and John N. Lyon\u2014?\u2014A. It would be endorsed as a collateral note, and a continuing security, absolutely.\nQ. You knew that it was an accommodation note that you were asking Dr. Gordon and Mr. Lyon for?\u2014A. No. They were directors of the defendant company, and they were interested in the defendant company.\nQ. And that was the only way that they were interested? They didn\u2019t owe any $10,000 to the Lount Engineering Co., did they?\u2014A. Oh no, not that I know of.\nQ. They were loaning their names. Isn\u2019t that what you thought?\u2014 A. They were endorsing the note.\n* * *\nQ. You were not taking much risk when you got Dr. Gordon\u2019s endorsement? We may figure that you were not?\u2014A. I hoped not. I was taking the note as good security, endorsed by Dr. Gordon.\n* * *\nQ. And in January you advanced $2,000 to the defendant company pursuant to the arrangement you made with Mr. Lount for these monthly advances, did you not?\u2014A. Yes.\n* * *\nQ. And that was a four months\u2019 note, was it not?\u2014A. Yes.\n* * *\nQ. I say you knew Mr. Lount wanted $10,000 with which to hold off his creditors, and you promised them, the defendant company, that? You knew that he wanted that amount of money in order to keep his creditors quiet?\u2014A. He told me that, yes. This was at the beginning of the negotiations.\nQ. And, consequently, $1,000, or $2,000, or $3,000, or $4,000, would be of no use whatever?\u2014A. Oh, I don\u2019t know about that. He didn\u2019t tell me that, but apparently it would not suit his purposes.\n* * *\nQ. It might have been possible that you would not be able to advance him any more than $4,000?\u2014A. That is it exactly; I didn\u2019t know that I could give him more than the $4,000. Q. You want us to think that Mr. Lount would embark on that enterprise, try to get $10,000 in one month, and only get $4,000 the next, and run the chances of being put out of business, and not be able to pay his creditors?\u2014A. That was exactly the risk that he would take.\nQ. Did you say that you promised to get on that $10,000 note ($10,000 on that .note (?))? Did you tell him that?\u2014A. No. I told him that I would do my best to obtain the money, to obtain what money I could against this advance of $10,000 note given as collateral security.\nQ. How much did you get?\u2014A. Well, he got, altogether, up to and including April, $11,500.\nQ. In March what?\u2014A. $8,000.\nQ. When he applied to you, what?\u2014A. It was $8,000.\nQ. You told him that he could not get any more?\u2014A. He asked me, I think, for an additional $2,000, and I said no, Lount, and that was all that there was to it.\n* * *\nQ. You told him that you would do what you could on the collateral note?\u2014A. I told him that I would do the best I could with the collateral note with the Royal Bank of Canada, and I didn\u2019t know what that would be.\nQ. You didn\u2019t do what you could, not what you could, because you didn\u2019t approach the bank for any more money when he approached you for that extra $2,000?\u2014A. I was quite determined I would not, and there was no contract or agreement to that effect and if there were I should have lived up to it.\n* * *\nQ. In your examination for discovery were you asked this question: \u201cAll you had in mind, in other words, at the time, was advancing of moneys to pay off his creditors, and accounts that were overdue?\u2014A. Yes, as against his collateral note.\u201d\nThat is correct?\u2014A. Yes, that is correct. I was not interested in anything else at that time. There was only that to finance, as I have explained to you.\nQ. Now question No. 371:\n\u201cAnd is the purpose for which you took the collateral note as you say?\u2014A. Oh, I required security before I would make these advances, and he gave me that collateral note as security.\u201d\nQ. That is correct?\u2014A. Yes.\nIn his examination-in-chief the plaintiff divided his total advances to the Lount Engineering Company, aggregating $32,547, into three groups:\u2014\nMr. Thomson: Q. The first group of loans amounted to $8,000 in connection with the note, Exhibit No. 1, alone. Is that correct?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And the next group of loans amounted to $15,545.50?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. All in connection with notes on the housing scheme?\u2014A. Yes, orders taken in connection with the housing scheme.\nQ. And the third group of loans was in connection with Exhibit No. 1, and the assignment, Exhibit No. 13. Is that correct?\u2014A. Yes, clear enough.\nQ. First $8,000, and then $15,545.50, and then $8,000 added?\u2014A. Yes. The last figure, $8,000, should be $8,912.71. He had said a little earlier:\u2014\nQ. What was the security for the $15,545?\u2014A. The orders against the mortgage loans which were being placed on houses which Lount, or the defendant company, was building.\nOn careful consideration of all the relevant admissible testimony the only reasonable conclusion is that the plaintiff took the $10,000 note (which, when endorsed by Dr. Gordon, he regarded as \u201cgood security\u201d) as collateral security only for five advances of $2,000 each to be made monthly and which he definitely agreed to make and that he well knew and understood that Dr. Gordon\u2019s endorsement had been obtained on that basis and none other\u2014 save that Dr. Gordon also understood that the arrangement would be made with a bank and not with such a lender as Hebblewhite. The evidence fully warranted the findings to that effect made by the trial judge, and, with respect, they should not have been disturbed.\nThe evidence also fully supports the finding by the trial judge that only $8,000 was advanced against the note in question and that the respondent refused early in March, when it was due, to make the final advance of $2,000. The finding of the learned judge who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal that this balance was in fact advanced during March and April rests upon a misunderstanding of the first question and answer in the following passage from Lount\u2019s evidence:\u2014\nHis Lordship: Did you get the last $2,000 in some other way?\u2014A. Yes. We had by that time found that we were not going to get the contract that we had been counting on, and I had started my houses, and I went to Mr. Hebblewhite and got money from him, both to carry on the houses and to pay off these creditors, and I used the money for both purposes.\nQ. In that way you got your final $2,000?\u2014A. Yes for a period of time. The first money I got in March was not all used to pay the creditors with.\nMr. Honeyman: The money which you got in March was advanced upon what?\u2014A. On an order on the mortgage loan upon the houses I was building.\nQ. That is the houses you were building in your own name?\u2014A. Oh,\nyes.\nQ. And that is the $1,000 in this exhibit which the plaintiff says that he advanced, the $1,000 on the 7th of March, 1923?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And that would be the $1,000 that you got by giving the order upon the houses which you were building personally, was it?\u2014A. Yes. What the witness clearly meant was that he had obtained by other means the last $2,000 needed to pay the March instalment to the creditors and not that the respondent had advanced that $2,000 on the security of the collateral $10,000 note. Lount\u2019s evidence, on the contrary, is that Hebblewhite positively and distinctly refused to make that final advance and that in fact he never advanced more than $8,000 against the $10,000 note. The money actually lent in March and April is included in the $15,545 which was all secured by orders against the mortgages under the housing scheme.\nBy refusing to advance the final $2,000 promised against the $10,000 collateral note the respondent declined to fulfil an essential condition of the appellant\u2019s undertaking of his obligation as guarantor and thereby discharged him from his liability. Burton v. Gray[16]; Whitcher v. Hall[17].\n(c) Without going at all fully into this phase of the case, we incline to think that the learned trial judge was also right in finding that any claim of the plaintiff, assuming him entitled to hold the defendant Gordon for repayment of the $8,000 advanced against the note sued on, was fully satisfied. Kinnaird v. Webster[18].\nA Manitoba Government contract\u2014the only one obtained by the Lount Engineering Company\u2014was duly assigned to the plaintiff in September, 1923, as promised in the letter of December 1st, 1922, and from it he received $5,762.08. He alleges that he made advances amounting to $8,912.71 to the company to enable it to carry out this contract and asserts the right to repayment of these advances before crediting the $5,762.08 of receipts against the earlier advances of $8,000 guaranteed by the note sued on. Against the Lount Engineering Company he may have such a right, but not, we think, against the appellant. As between him and the respondent the stipulation agreed to that the proceeds of any Manitoba Government contract assigned by the company to the respondent should be applied to the repayment of the advances made as against the note endorsed by the appellant was never in any way departed from or qualified. The appellant is entitled to have it carried out. Newton v. Chorlton[19]. Failure to apply these moneys as stipulated for by the surety would amount to a variation in the contract which would release him. Canadian Bank of Commerce v. Swan-son[20]; Pearl v. Deacon[21].\nHaving voluntarily appropriated three other payments aggregating $4,648.40\u201412,738.40, $1,000, $900\u2014of the Lount Engineering Company\u2019s moneys toward payment of the notes taken for advances made against the $10,000 note now in suit, the plaintiff should not be heard to say that such appropriations were a mere matter of book-keeping and were not meant to extinguish pro tanto the liability for which alone the $10,000 note was collateral.\nAs to the item of $2,738.40 the plaintiff asserts that that was in fact paid out of the proceeds of another loan or advance made by him to the company and that he got no benefit from it and on this ground the Court of Appeal held him not bound to give credit for that sum. But the evidence shows that such other loan was in itself fully repaid to the plaintiff by the receipt of moneys from the Lount Engineering Company. This fact, or its significance, would seem to have escaped the attention of the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff is in our opinion bound by the appropriation of the three amounts above specified towards satisfaction of the $8,000 of the Lount Engineering Company\u2019s indebtedness secured by the $10,000 collateral note. The fact, though not strictly relevant, may also be noted that the advances made in March and April were fully repaid by the proceeds of housing-scheme orders.\nFor these reasons we are, with great respect, of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and that the judgment of the learned trial judge, in so far as it dismisses the action with costs as against the defendant Gordon (who alone appealed to this court), should be restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McWilliams, Gunn & Honeyman.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Thomson, Thomson & Thomson.\n[1] (1880) 6 App. Cas. 1, at p. 11.\n[2] the terms and co\n[3] [1927] S.C.R. 1.\n[4] (1844) 7 Beav., 551, at pp. 561-4.\n[5] (1856) 6 E. & B., 902, at p. 914.\n[6] [1877] W.N. 211.\n[7] (1853) 10 Hare, 646, at pp. 652-3.\n[8] [1925] S.C.R. 587.\n[9] (1878) 9 Ch.

As in the case of primary negligence, there must be proof, or at least evidence from which it can reasonably be inferred, that the negligence charged was a proximate, in the sense of an effective, cause of the injury (Spaight v. Tedcastle, 6 App. Cas. 217, at p. 219; Beven on Negligence\u2014Can. Ed.\u2014at p. 155; Admiralty Commissioners v. SS. Volute [1922] A.C. 129, at p. 136, and other cases, cited).\nDamage or loss is \u201ccaused\u201d by the fault of two or more persons, within the meaning of s. 2 of The Contributory Negligence Act, only when the fault of each is a proximate or efficient cause thereof; i.e., only when at common law each would properly have been held guilty of negligence which contributed to causing the injurious occurrence (Can. Pac. Ry. Co. v. Frechette, [1915] A.C. 871, at p. 879). The Contributory Negligence Act had no application to the case at bar.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, ([1926] 3 D.L.R. 918), reversed in part.\nQuaere whether, assuming the boy\u2019s contributory fault, The Contributory Negligence Act would apply to affect the father\u2019s claim (which was to recover medical and other expenses for which defendants\u2019 negligence entailing injury to his son subjected him to legal liability). McKittrick v. Byers (58 Ont. L.R. 158), and Knowlton v. Hydro Electric Power Commission of Ontario (58 Ont. L.R. 80) commented on; the wording of s. 2 of the Act referred to.\nPer Newcombe J.: S. 2 of The Contributory Negligence Act states a case where there is no liability at common law. It has applied to persons with relation to their liability for negligence, the wording of s. 2 of The Maritime Conventions Act, 1914 (Dom.), which Act did not declare a liability where none previously existed, but regulated, as to each of the vessels at fault, the measure of damages in proportion to the degree of fault. Quaere whether the New Brunswick legislature, having gone to the Admiralty provisions for the enunciation of the law, thereby adopts the Admiralty principles of contribution, including that expressed in Admiralty Commissioners v. SS. Volute ([1922] 1 A.C. 129 at p. 144).\nAPPEAL by the defendants, and cross-appeal by the plaintiffs, from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division[1] affirming, with a variation, the judgment of Crockett J.\nThe action was for damages for injury to the infant plaintiff, while riding on the defendants\u2019 motor truck, by reason of an accident caused, as alleged, through negligent driving of the truck by the defendants\u2019 servant.\nThe defendants conducted a bakery in the city of St. John, and delivered a portion of their goods by motor trucks to points outside the city. The accident in question occurred on a road some miles from the city. The truck plunged off the road, and the infant plaintiff, a boy about ten years of age, who was on the running board, was injured. The boy (by his father as next friend) and his father sued the defendants for damages.\nThe case was tried before Crockett J. with a jury. The following were the questions submitted to the jury at the close of the evidence, with the answers thereto:\n1. Q. Was there any negligence on the part of the defendants\u2019 chauffeur Rogers?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. If so, in what did such negligence consist?\u2014A. First, in allowing the boy on the running board of the car.\nSecond, lack of proper attention to his duty of driving the car just previous to and at the time of the accident.\n2. Q. Was the injury to the infant plaintiff entirely caused by the negligence set out in your answer to question one?\u2014A. No.\n3. Q. Was the infant plaintiff guilty of any contributory negligence without which the accident would not have happened?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. If so, in what did such negligence consist?\u2014A. By staying on the car after having been asked to get off, and by standing on the running board of the car when it was moving.\n4. Q. If you find there was any contributory negligence on the part, of the infant plaintiff, to what degree was he at fault?\u2014A. Twenty-five per cent of the amount that otherwise would have been allowed.\n5. Q. Was the infant plaintiff on the running board with the permission and consent of Rogers?\u2014A. Yes.\n6. Q. At what sum do you assess the damage to the father?\u2014A. $559.75.\n7. Q. At what amount do you assess the damage to the infant plaintiff?\u2014A. $3,000. The jury explained that the amount awarded the infant plaintiff would have been about $4,000 had there been no contributory negligence; the $3,000 was awarded after deducting the 25 per cent.\nS. 2 of The Contributory Negligence Act of New Brunswick, 1925, c. 41, provides that\nWhere by the fault of two or more persons damage or loss is caused to one or more of them, the liability to make good the damage or loss shall be in proportion to the degree in which each person was at fault: * * *\nCrockett J. directed that a verdict be entered for $559.75 in favour of the plaintiff Edwin W. Long, and for $3,000 in favour of the infant plaintiff Joseph John Long by his next friend Edwin W. Long. He said\ni did not deal with the question as to whether the plaintiffs were entitled to have a verdict entered under the Motor Vehicle Act Amendment of 1925, because, in my view of the law, at common law the master would be liable.\nOn appeal by the defendants and cross-appeal by the plaintiffs to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, it was ordered that the verdict entered for the infant plaintiff for $3,000 should stand; that the verdict for the plaintiff Edwin W. Long for $559.75 be reduced to $419.83 (applying the 25 per cent reduction); and that the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal (asking that the general damages awarded to the infant plaintiff be increased to $4,000) be dismissed.\nThe defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, asking that the verdict for the plaintiffs should be set aside, and a verdict entered for the defendants, or, failing that, asking for a new trial or reduction of the verdict; and the plaintiffs cross-appealed against the reduction of the damages of the plaintiff Edwin W. Long, and against the refusal of the appellate court to increase the infant plaintiff\u2019s damages to $4,000.\nG. H. V. Belyea K.C. for the appellant.\nR. S. Robertson K.C. and W. R. Scott for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The material facts of this case are fully stated in the judgment of the Appeal Division delivered by the learned Chief Justice of New Brunswick[2]. Although other aspects of the action were presented in argument, the defendants\u2019 appeal may in our opinion be disposed of by determining whether liability has been established under the New Brunswick Motor Vehicle Law, 1915, (5 Geo. V, c. 43, s. 4\u2014as amended by 15 Geo. V, c. 10, s. 3), and the respondents\u2019 cross-appeal as to the application of The Contributory Negligence Act (15 Geo. V, c. 41) by deciding whether the issue of contributory negligence should have been withdrawn from the jury on the ground that there was no evidence on which an affirmative finding could be based.\nThe attack made upon the findings of the jury, that the injury to the infant plaintiff was caused by negligence of the defendants\u2019 driver, consisting first \u201cin allowing the boy on the running board of the car,\u201d and, second, in \u201clack of proper attention to his duty of driving the car just previous to and at the time of the accident,\u201d was ineffective. There is abundant evidence to sustain these findings and there can be no doubt that they establish that the defendants\u2019 motor vehicle was operated by their servant on a public highway \u201cso as to endanger the life or limb\u201d of the infant plaintiff.\nSubsection 1 of section 4 of the New Brunswick Motor Vehicle Law, 1915, reads in part as follows:\n4. (1) No person shall operate a motor vehicle on a public highway at a greater rate of speed than is reasonable and proper, having regard to the traffic and use of the highway, or so as to endanger the life or limb of any person, or the safety of any property * * *\nSubsection 6 (added to section 4 in 1925) provides that:\n(6) The owner of a motor vehicle shall be responsible civilly as well as hereunder for any violation of any provision of this Act or of any regulation made under this Act, unless at the time of such violation the motor vehicle was in the possession of some person other than the owner, without his consent, expressed or implied, and the driver of a motor vehicle not being the owner, shall also be responsible for any such violation, provided that no such owner shall be liable to imprisonment in respect of such violation.\nThe motor vehicle at the time of the occurrence in question was admittedly in possession of the driver with the owners\u2019 consent.\nIt has been suggested that the benefit of subsection 1 of section 4 should be confined to persons using the highway other than those in or upon a motor vehicle the operation of which causes injury. While such persons may have been the immediate object of solicitude by the legislature in enacting the Motor Vehicle Law, we fail to find in the statute anything which would justify placing such a restriction on the comprehensive words \u201cany person\u201d in the clause \u201cso as to endanger the life or limb of any person.\u201d Nor does it seem material in connection with this statutory liability to determine the precise legal status of the infant plaintiff while riding on the running board of the motor truck, although it by no means follows that contributory negligence on his part, if established, would not afford a defence to his claim as has been held in regard to other statutes imposing similar liability, for instance, in the well-known cases under the Factories\u2019 Acts.\nThe facts alleged in the statement of claim suffice to bring the case within the ambit of s. 4 of the Motor Vehicle Law, 1915. Paragraph 5 reads:\nThe said motor truck was driven so recklessly, incapably, negligently and without exercising reasonable and proper care, it plunged off the road and struck a tree and a telegraph pole and badly injured the said infant plaintiff.\nNo doubt liability at common law of the defendants as masters and employers of the driver was chiefly stressed at the trial. But the right of the plaintiffs to invoke the Motor Vehicle Law, 1915, was also distinctly asserted by their counsel and the learned trial judge expressly stated that he refrained from dealing with that aspect of the matter only because he was quite convinced of the defendants\u2019 liability at common law. The case was fully tried out. There is no suggestion that if possible liability under the statute had been earlier or more pointedly brought to the attention of the defendants\u2019 counsel any other or further evidence would have been adduced, or that such evidence is now available. We see no valid reason for excluding the plaintiffs in this action from the benefit of the Motor Vehicle Law, 1915, and that statute is, in our opinion (subject to the question of contributory negligence presently to be considered), conclusive of the liability of the defendants as owners of the motor vehicle the negligent operation of which caused injury to the infant plaintiff resulting in the loss of his arm. The plaintiffs\u2019 challenge of the finding of contributory negligence affects both the appeal and the cross-appeal. If there is no evidence to support that finding the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover is clear and no question of apportioning the damages can arise. The contributory negligence of the infant plaintiff as found by the jury was \u201cby staying on the car after having been asked to get off, and by standing on the running board of the car when it was moving.\u201d They had already found the driver negligent \u201cin allowing the boy on the running board of the car.\u201d The evidence is consistent only with the view that the boy remained on the running board with the tacit consent of the driver.\nAt the trial, counsel for the plaintiffs distinctly asked for the withdrawal of the issue of contributory negligence from the jury before the learned judge made his charge, and again at its conclusion in these words:\nMr. Scott: I wish it to be distinctly understood and noted that I am objecting to any question of contributory negligence in this case going to the jury.\nThe Court: That is clear. If there is no such evidence as would warrant me in submitting the question to the jury, it would be open to you whether you objected or not.\nAgain, in his argument on the motion for entry of verdict counsel for the plaintiffs took this position:\nThere was no act of Jackie Long\u2019s which was the decisive cause of the injury to himself or which materially contributed to it or affected it in any way. * * * Contributory negligence must in effect have been the decisive cause of the collision * * *. The act of getting up on the running board * * * is separate and distinct from the negligence which was the decisive cause of the injury, namely the so handling the car that it ran off the road and collided with the tree.\nWith the utmost respect, it would appear that in the courts below the application to a charge of contributory negligence of the maxim, in lege causa proxima, non remota, spectatur, was not sufficiently adverted to.\nIn Spaight v. Tedcastle[3], Lord Chancellor Selborne said, at p. 219,\nGreat injustice might be done, if, in applying the doctrine of contributory negligence * * * the maxim, causa proxima, non remota spectatur, were lost sight of * * *. An omission ought not to be regarded as contributory negligence if it might in the circumstances which actually happened have been unattended with danger but for the defendants\u2019 fault, and if it had no proper connection as a cause with the damage which followed as its effect. In order to constitute contributory negligence it does not suffice that there should be some fault on the part of the plaintiff without which the injury that he complains of would not have been suffered; a cause which is merely a sine qua non is not adequate. As in the case of primary negligence charged against the defendant, there must be proof, or at least evidence from which it can reasonably be inferred, that the negligence charged was a proximate, in the sense of an effective, cause of such injury. The law on this point is admirably stated by Mr. Beven in his work on \u201cNegligence\u201d in the following passage: (Canadian Edition, at p. 155):\nMuch of the difficulty in fixing the meaning of contributory negligence arises from the ambiguous use of the phrase, \u201ccontributing to the injury.\u201d This may indicate any of the whole set of antecedents necessary to produce the effect, or that one of them which marks their final completion and the actual calling into being of the effect. The causa sine qua non of an accident is not that on which depends the legal imputability of the accident. The liability depends not on that but on the causa efficiens. In fact the same test is applicable to the ascertaining what negligence contributes to an injury, as we have already applied to the ascertaining negligence itself. We must trace the negligent consequences to the last responsible agent, who, either seeing the negligent consequences or negligently refusing to see them, has put into motion the force by which the injury was produced.\nNot only would any injurious consequences of the infant plaintiff\u2019s fault in standing on the running board of the car probably have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary care and caution by the defendants\u2019 driver (Tuff v. Warman[4]), but no view is possible on the evidence before us other than that it was the failure of the driver to take such ordinary care and caution in the operation of the motor vehicle which was the sole direct cause\u2014causa causans\u2014or, as Lord Sumner suggested in B.C. Electric Ry. Co. v. Loach[5], \u201cthe cause\u201d of the infant plaintiff\u2019s injury.\nA. is suing for damages * * *. He was negligent, but his negligence had brought about a state of things in which there would have been no damage if B. (the defendant) had not been subsequently and severably negligent. A. recovers in full.\n(Admiralty Commissioners v. SS. Volute[6]).\nWe are for these reasons of the opinion that there was no evidence to submit to the jury on the issue of contributory negligence\u2014no evidence on which they could find that fault of the infant plaintiff was in the legal sense a causes of his injury; and that the learned judge should accordingly have acceded to the request of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel that the questions on that issue should be withdrawn, and, failing that, should have acceded to his subsequent motion that judgment be entered in favour of the plaintiffs for the full amount of the damages found by the jury regardless of the finding of contributory negligence.\nIn our opinion, within the meaning of s. 2 of The Contributory Negligence Act of New Brunswick (1925, c. 41) damage or loss is \u201ccaused\u201d by the fault of two or more persons only when the fault of each of such persons is a proximate or efficient cause of such damage or loss, i.e., only when at common law each would properly have been held guilty of negligence which contributed to causing the injurious occurrence. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Frechette[7]. It follows that The Contributory Negligence Act has no application to the case at bar.\nTo avoid misapprehension we should, perhaps, add that neither approval of, nor dissent from, the opinion of the New Brunswick Appeal Division that, on the finding of the infant plaintiff\u2019s contributory fault, The Contributory Negligence Act would apply also to the case of the adult plaintiff may be inferred from the present judgment. The claim of the father is to recover medical and other expenses for which the negligence of the defendants entailing injury to his infant son subjected him to legal liability. There is recent judicial authority for the view that contributory negligence of the infant plaintiff in the case at bar would at common law preclude the father\u2019s recovery upon his own claim. McKittrick v. Byers[8]; Knowlton v. Hydro Electric Power Commission of Ontario[9]. In these cases the position of the father is assimilated to that of a master who sues for tortious injury to his servant. That analogy is perhaps questionable and there is not a little to be said for the view that instead of the negligence of the infant plaintiff being attributable to his father so as to bar his recovery, the former and the defendants are, quoad the father, rather in the position of joint tortfeasors. But, if the view taken in the two Ontario cases be sound, is the father one \u201cof two or more persons\u201d whose fault caused injury \u201cto one or more of them\u201d within s. 2 of the statute? It is unnecessary, however, to deal further with this question, interesting as it is, in view of our conclusion that the finding of contributory negligence on the part of the infant plaintiff cannot be sustained.\nIt is sufficiently clear upon the record that the jury meant to find that the total damages of the infant plaintiff amounted to $4,000, and reduced their verdict in his favour to $3,000 solely by making a reduction of 25% under The Contributory Negligence Act.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs, and the cross-appeal allowed with costs, and judgment should be entered for the plaintiff Joseph John Long for $4,000, and for the plaintiff Edwin W. Long for $559.70, and also for their costs of the action and of the appeal and cross-appeal to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick.\nNewcombe J.\u2014The Contributory Negligence Act of New Brunswick, ch. 41 of 1925, s. 2, enacts that:\nWhere by the fault of two or more persons damage or loss is caused to one or more of them, the liability to make good the damage or loss shall be in proportion to the degree in which each person was at fault.\nIt thus states a case where there is no liability at common law. Lord Blackburn in Cayzer v. Carron[10], said:\nWhere the cause of the accident is the fault of one party and one party only, Admiralty and Common Law both agree in saying that that one party who is to blame shall bear the whole damage of the other. When the cause of the accident is the fault of both, each party being guilty of blame which causes the accident, there is a difference between the rule of Admiralty and the rule of Common Law. The rule of Common Law says, as each occasioned the accident neither shall recover at all, and it shall be just like an inevitable accident; the loss shall lie where it falls. Admiralty says, on the contrary, if both contributed to the loss it shall be brought into hotchpotch and divided between the two. Until the case of Hay v. Le Neve[11], which has been referred to in the argument, there was a question in the Admiralty Court whether you were not to apportion it according to the degree in which they were to blame; but now it is, I think, quite settled, and there is no dispute about it, that the rule of the Admiralty is, that if there is blame causing the accident on both sides they are to divide the loss equally, just as the rule of law is that if there is blame causing the accident on both sides, however small that blame may be on one side, the loss lies where it falls.\nTherefore, at common law, there was no contribution, but in Admiralty, although the question of fault was regulated by the same principles as those prevailing at common law, a plaintiff against whom contributory fault had been found, could, by the law maritime, recover half his loss.\nThe Maritime Conventions Act, 1914, of Canada, ch. 13 of 1914, s. 2, does not declare a liability where none previously existed. It regulates, as to each of the vessels at fault, the measure of damages in proportion to the degree of fault. Now the New Brunswick Legislature has applied this Act, ipsissima verba, to persons with relation to their liability for negligence. When the question arises as to what is the effect of this, the language will, presumably, be construed so that if possible the enactment may have a reasonable application, and therefore, if there be no conceivable common law liability in the case stated by the statute, the court may, not improbably, find an intention to impose statutory liability in such cases; but, if so, seeing that the legislature has gone to the Admiralty provisions for the enunciation of the law, does it thereby adopt the Admiralty principles of contribution?\u2014including that expressed by Lord Birkenhead in the House of Lords in Admiralty Commissioners v. SS. Volute[12], as follows:\nI think that the question of contributory negligence must be dealt with somewhat broadly and upon common-sense principles as a jury would probably deal with it. And while no doubt, where a clear line can be drawn, the subsequent negligence is the only one to look to, there are cases in which the two acts come so closely together, and the second act of negligence is so much mixed up with the state of things brought about by the first act, that the party secondly negligent, while not held free from blame under the Bywell Castle rule, might, on the other hand, invoke the prior negligence as being part of the cause of the collision so as to make it a case of contribution. And the Maritime Conventions Act with its provisions for nice qualifications as to the quantum of blame and the proportions in which contribution is to be made may be taken as to some extent declaratory of the Admiralty rule in this respect.\nThese questions may, as I have said, be decided when they arise; but in this case we heard no argument upon the interpretation of the statute, and I do not find it necessary to assent to more, upon the point involved in The Contributory Negligence Act, than that, in my opinion, the infant plaintiff\u2019s negligence was not a cause, or any part of the cause, of the injury which he suffered, and therefore that The Contributory Negligence Act has nothing to do with the case.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, and cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.J.

He discussed the matter with plaintiff and, before going to England, gave plaintiff a letter from the company in which he said \"Relative to the project of building grain elevators, etc., in Vancouver, concerning which we have had several discussions ***. I shall be pleased to take advantage of the letters of introduction which you have given me to the following persons and concerns [which were here set out]. In the event of my being successful in raising the money required for my project, from or through any of these concerns, I *** agree on behalf of [defendant company] to protect you to the extent of 2% commission on the amount of money so raised, said commission to be paid to you as and when the money is received.\" G. did not present the letters of introduction but, through a cable sent at plaintiff's instance, he was met in England by an official of one of the concerns mentioned in the letter, who introduced him to an official of S., with whom eventually an agreement was made by which S. should loan the money required up to $2,500,000, to erect an elevator on an enlarged site, but the elevator and site were to be the property of a new company, 70% of the shares of which were to become the property of S. who should elect a majority of the board of directors. Plaintiff claimed commission, but the defendants alleged that the project ultimately arrived at and carried out between G. and S. was so entirely different (particularly, among other things, as to the holding of control) from the project originally contemplated that it did not come within the terms of the commission agreement. There was conflicting evidence of what G. had told plaintiff was his project when the agreement for commission was made.\nHeld, reversing judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia (36 B.C. Rep. 512), Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting, that plaintiff could not recover; the agreement for commission constituted a special employment, and its restricted character precluded him from claiming commission in respect to an advance for the carrying out of the project ultimately arrived at, which was essentially different from that contemplated when plaintiff was engaged.\nIn arranging for the carrying out of the project arrived at, steps were taken for the transfer of defendant company's assets to a new company in consideration of all the capital shares of the new company, and provision was made for distribution of said shares by way of dividend to the shareholders of defendant company. The agreement with S. was not consummated until after the payment of this dividend. Plaintiff sought to hold the directors of defendant company liable, under s. 82 of the Companies Act, R.S.C., 1906, c. 79, for having paid this dividend without providing for payment of his claim for commission. Idington and Duff JJ., dissenting, who held defendant company liable to plaintiff, held also that the directors were liable; that plaintiff's claim, if not strictly a debt \" existing \" at the time the dividend was paid, was a debt \" thereafter contracted \" within the meaning of s. 82.\nAPPEAL by defendants from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[1] which (M. A. Macdonald J.A. dissenting), dismissed an appeal by defendants, and allowed a cross-appeal by plaintiff, from a judgment of Gregory J.[2] in an action to recover commission.\nIn 1923 the defendant The Terminal Grain Company Limited, a Dominion company, having corporate powers enabling it, inter alia, to construct and work elevators and mills, had its head office in Vancouver, the defendant Gale being president of it, and the defendants Smith and Gurd, with Gale, directors. The company held a lease of a property on the Vancouver waterfront from the Vancouver Harbour Commissioners, reserving a yearly rental of $4,400, and by that instrument, among other provisions, it was stipulated that the demised premises should be used solely for the purposes of a grain elevator and feed and flour mill, and that an elevator and mill constructed according to plans approved by the Harbour Commissioners, and costing not less than $500,000, should be begun within six months and completed within two years from the date of the lease, which was 19th July, 1923.\nAt a meeting of the directors held on 10th August, 1923, it was resolved\nthat the president be authorized to enter into negotiations and conclude arrangements on such terms as he shall consider reasonable, for the raising of the sum of $1,000,000 or such other sum as may be found to be necessary for the erection and equipment of the elevator proposed to be erected by the company, and also for a feed mill and for working capital; and that such moneys may be raised in one or more ways and in one or more sums, and at different times, and either by the sale of debentures, secured in such manner and payable on such terms as he may deem it expedient to concede, or by the sale of preferred shares with any rights and restrictions he may deem it advisable to grant, or by the sale of common stock or by any two or more of such methods; and in pursuing such negotiations to enter into such engagements and or financial obligations on behalf of the company as he may find to be necessary or expedient; and for the attainment of said object to proceed to England or elsewhere at the company's expense.\nAccording to the plans of the directors, Gale was to proceed, and did proceed, to England to attempt to raise the money there. Before leaving Vancouver, he discussed the subject of his visit to England with the plaintiff. As a result, Gale, on behalf of The Terminal Grain Company Limited, wrote to plaintiff, on August 30, 1923, the following letter embodying the agreement which is the basis of the plaintiff's action:\nRelative to the project of building grain elevators, etc., in Vancouver, concerning which we have had several discussions, I beg to advise that I shall be pleased to take advantage of the letters of introduction which you have given me to the following persons and concerns:\n[Here are set out the persons or concerns referred to.]\nIn the event of my being successful in raising the money required for my project, from or through any of these concerns, I shall be pleased and do hereby agree on behalf of the Terminal Grain Company Limited, to protect you to the extent of two (2%) per cent, commission on the amount of money so raised, said commission to be paid to you as and when the money is received. *** Gale proceeded to England. He did not present the letters of introduction given him by the plaintiff, but through a cable sent, at the plaintiff's request, from Vancouver by an official (who had just arrived at Vancouver) of the Canadian British Corporation (one of the concerns mentioned in Gale's letter to plaintiff aforesaid), Gale was met in England by another official of the Canadian British Corporation, who subsequently introduced him to Sir William Nicholls, of Spillers Milling and Associated Industries Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as the \"Spillers\"). Eventually an agreement was arrived at between Gale and the Spillers by which the Spillers should loan the money required, up to $2,500,000, to erect an elevator on an enlarged site, including the land leased to The Terminal Grain Co., Ltd., by the Harbour Commissioners, but the elevator and site were to be the property of a new company, The Vancouver Terminal Grain Co., Ltd., and 70% of the shares of the new company were to become the property of the Spillers, who should elect the majority of the membership of the board of directors.\nOn 8th February, 1924, the old company, The Terminal Grain Co. Ltd., and the new company, The Vancouver Terminal Grain Co. Ltd., entered into an agreement by which the old company agreed to transfer all its assets to the new company in consideration of the allotment to the old company or its nominees of all the capital shares of the new company. On the same date a resolution was passed at a meeting of the directors of The Terminal Grain Co. Ltd., and also at a general meeting of the company, providing for the payment of a dividend by distribution among the shareholders of The Terminal Grain Co. Ltd., of the said shares. Later, on consummation of the agreement with the Spillers, arrangement was made for the transfer of 70% of the shares to the Spillers, according to the understanding on which the Spillers entered into the project as above mentioned.\nThe main questions in dispute were:\n(1) Was the plaintiff entitled to commission from the defendant The Terminal Grain Co. Ltd.? This would appear to depend on whether or not it could be said that the arrangement ultimately arrived at between Gale and the Spillers came within the scope of Gale's \" project\" as referred to in his letter to plaintiff of 30th August, 1923. There was also involved the question of whether the agreement sued upon constituted a general or special employment of the plaintiff.\n(2) If the plaintiff was entitled to commission, on what basis should it be calculated?\n(3) If the plaintiff was entitled to commission, had he a claim against the defendants the directors of The Terminal Grain Co. Ltd., under s. 82 of the Companies Act, R.S.C., 1906, c. 79, upon the ground that they had declared and paid a dividend to the shareholders, which exhausted the capital of the company, without making provision for payment of his claim for commission?\nOn behalf of the plaintiff it was contended that the contract with him was one which contemplated payment of a commission in the event of variations being made in the proposal of The Terminal Grain Co. Ltd., and the variations that were made in the deal consummated were within the scope of the original proposition, so that the promise to pay commission included a promise to pay commission in the deal as actually consummated.\nOn behalf of the defendants it was contended that the project referred to in Gale's letter to plaintiff of 30th August, 1923, was changed entirely, and, indeed, abandoned altogether, and a new one substituted, involving, among other things, an entirely different arrangement than that originally contemplated as to the holding of control.\nThe resolution of 10th August, 1923, above quoted, had not been shown to the plaintiff. The parol evidence as to what Gale told the plaintiff was his project, was conflicting.\nThe trial judge, Gregory J., held the plaintiff entitled to commission, the formal judgment limiting the commission to 2% on $1,000,000. He also held the defendant directors jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff for the amount of said commission, under s. 82 of the Companies Act, R.S.C., 1906, c. 79.\nThe court of appeal affirmed the judgment of Gregory J. in holding plaintiff entitled to commission, and the defendant directors liable under s. 82 of the Companies Act; but (allowing a cross-appeal by plaintiff) it varied his judgment by striking out the proviso limiting the commission recoverable to 2% on $1,000,000. Martin J.A. dissented on the question of the directors' liability. M. A. Macdonald J.A, dissenting, held that the plaintiff was not entitled to any commission, as the project actually carried out was so different from the one originally contemplated that it did not come within the terms of Gale's letter to the plaintiff of 30th August, 1923. Having reached this conclusion, he found it unnecessary to deal with the point of law in respect to the alleged liability of the directors. His reasons were substantially adopted by the majority of the court in the judgments now reported.\nE. P. Davis K.C. and E. F. Newcombe for the appellants.\nC. W. Craig K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014Substantially for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice M. A. Macdonald in his dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal, I would allow this appeal and dismiss the plaintiff's action.\nThe agreement sued upon constituted a special employment of the respondent. The contract eventually made was for the carrying out of a project essentially different from that contemplated when the respondent was engaged. Whatever might have been the case had the respondent's employment been general, its restricted character, in my opinion, precludes his right to claim commission in respect of an advance of moneys for the carrying out of a project entirely outside the contemplation of the parties at the time the respondent was so employed.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014I agree in the main with the reasoning of each of the four judges in their several judgments in the court below upon which was founded the judgment from which appeal is taken herein.\nI entirely agree with the judgment of my brother Duff, and hence with his conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nI was for a time during the argument and later, inclined to agree with the decision of the learned trial judge, but the result of the full consideration I have given the case renders it impossible for me to agree with his judgment in limiting the commission to 2% on $1,000,000. The documents upon which the respondent's claim rests seem expressly to contemplate obtaining money to a greater extent than the $1,000,000, and, as put by the Chief Justice in the court below, it seems to be all or nothing.\nThe respondent, being either a sensible man desiring to avoid further litigation or, failing that, feeling that he might reasonably be satisfied, under all the circumstances of the case, with $20,000, offered to abandon his cross appeal if the present appellants abandoned their appeal.\nThis mid-way that the respondent was willing to go has been treated with contempt, and hitherto, has been supported by only one judge, who can find no cause of action.\nThe excellent factum of counsel for the respondent has produced an array of authorities, and such an analysis of the evidence and dealing with the various views taken by the judges in the courts below, presents a case that adds much to what my brother Duff has considered, but the essential features thereof are fully presented by him and in such a way as renders it unnecessary for me to resort to the many other features put forward in said factum.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014In 1923 the appellant, The Terminal Grain Company, Limited, a Dominion company (having corporate powers enabling it, inter alia, to construct and work elevators and mills), had its head office in Vancouver, the appellant Gale being president of it, and the appellants Smith and Gurd, with Gale, directors. The company held a lease of a property on the Vancouver water front from the Vancouver Harbour Commissioners, reserving an annual rental of four thousand dollars odd, and by that instrument, among other provisions, it was stipulated that the demised premises should be used solely for the purposes of a grain elevator and feed and flour mill, and that an elevator and mill, constructed according to plans approved by the Harbour Commissioners, and costing not less than $500,000, should be begun within six months, and completed within two years from its date, which was the 19th of July, 1923. At a meeting of the directors held on the 10th of August, of that year, the president was authorized to take steps and conclude arrangements \" for raising the sum of one million dollars or such other sum as may be found necessary \" for the erection and equipment of the proposed elevator and feed mill, and \" for working capital.\" By the terms of the resolution by which this authority was conferred, the president was empowered to raise this money\nin one or more ways and in one or more sums, and at different times, and either by the sale of debentures *** or by the sale of preferred shares *** or by the sale of common stock, or by any two or more of such methods and *** to enter into such engagements or financial obligations on behalf of the company as he may find to be necessary or expedient.\nAccording to the plans of the directors, Gale was to proceed, and did proceed, to England to attempt to raise this money there.\nBefore leaving Vancouver, Gale discussed the subject of his visit to England with the respondent and, the respondent having delivered to Gale certain letters of introduction, an agreement was entered into between them, Gale speaking in the name of The Terminal Grain Company, by which the respondent was to receive a commission of two per cent, on moneys raised \" from or through \" any of the concerns to whom these letters of introduction were directed. This agreement is embodied in a letter addressed to the respondent and signed by The Terminal Grain Company, and is the basis of the respondent's action.\nThe primary issue for determination is whether or not the conditions have been fulfilled upon which the respondent's right to commission must rest, according to the terms of this letter.\nGale did, in fact, procure an arrangement with the Spillers Milling and Associated Industries, Limited (whom I shall designate as the Spillers), of which Sir William Nicholls was managing director, one of a group of concerns to which Spillers & Baker, one of the firms mentioned in the letter of the 30th of August, belonged; Gale having been introduced to Sir William Nicholls by Mr. White, of the Canadian British Corporation, Limited, another concern mentioned in that letter, at the instance of the respondent. The learned trial judge finds as a fact, and this finding is accepted by the Court of Appeal, that Gale was introduced to the Spillers through the Canadian British Corporation, and that his introduction to the Canadian British Corporation was the \"direct and immediate result of the plaintiff's act supplementing his letter of introduction to them.\" This finding is adequately supported by the evidence, and we need not stop to discuss it. By the arrangement with the Spillers, a sufficient sum, up to two and a half million dollars, was to be provided for the building of a grain elevator at Vancouver, on an enlarged site, including the land leased to The Terminal Grain Company by the Harbour Commissioners. But by the scheme as ultimately settled, the elevator and the site were to be the property of a new company, The Vancouver Grain Company, and seventy per cent, of the shares of the new company were to become the property of the Spillers. The proposition upon which the claim of the respondent rests is that this sum, which the Spillers on these terms agreed to advance, answers the description in the letter of the 30th of August as being \" money raised \" for The Terminal Grain Company's \" project,\" and that, this money having been procured through the Spillers, to whom Gale was introduced by the Canadian British Corporation, one of the concerns mentioned in the letter, the company cannot deny that it has been \" successful\" in raising the money \" required \" for its \" project\" in a manner contemplated by the letter. In the courts below and in this court, the debate turned chiefly upon the point, which is really the crux of the dispute, whether moneys procured for the purpose outlined, and by the means and on the terms outlined, can fairly be said to be \" the money required for \" The Terminal Grain Company's \" project,\" within the meaning of the letter.\nOn behalf of the appellants it is said that at the time when this letter was written the plan of the directors of The Terminal Grain Company was to raise money by way of loan, with or without a bonus of shares, but that an essential element of the plan as they conceived it, and as Gale described it to the respondent, was that the relation between the company and the persons furnishing the money should in substance be that of borrowers and lenders merely, and that the voting control and the actual management of the company should remain in the hands of Gale and Smith; and that the scheme ultimately adopted, under external pressure, involved departures in respect of these essentials so great as to give it the character of an entirely new \" project \"\u2014a \" project \" of a type not contemplated by the agreement between the parties.\nOn behalf of the respondent it is said that this condition, of retaining the control and the management in the hands of the existing directors, was never imparted to the respondent, and that in truth it never was regarded as of the essence of the directors' plans, and that Gale, while desiring to retain control, never regarded that as more than a desideratum.\nThe learned trial judge has found, on these disputed points, in favour of the respondent, and four out of five of the learned judges who sat in the Court of Appeal have concurred in these findings. These concurrent findings, it goes without saying, the appellants cannot succeed in reversing, without establishing\u2014proving, that is to say, to a demonstration\u2014some specific error or errors vitiating the grounds upon which the findings proceed.\nTwo considerations militate gravely against the appellants' attack on the conclusions of the courts below. The first arises out of the terms of the resolution already quoted. On the face of it, the resolution makes provision for the possible modification of plans, both as to the amount to be raised and as to the manner of raising it, of a radical character, with a view, one cannot doubt, to coping with the vicissitudes of the negotiations and satisfying the ultimate requirements of the London market. Admittedly, at an early stage, before the Spillers had been interviewed at all, the amount had been increased by Gale, on his own authority, from one million to two millions. In view of the character of the alternatives provided for in the resolution, it seems difficult to say that the resolution itself does not contemplate the abandonment of control by the existing shareholders as a possibility at least. One of the methods specified for raising the money required is by a sale of common stock, and by that alone. In other words, the resolution contemplated the possibility of acquiring the money needed from persons who should not become lenders at all, but virtually co-owners. It is indeed difficult to suppose that experienced men of affairs could have thought of seeking to procure capital on such a scale upon such terms without looking forward to the abandonment of control as a likely, if not, indeed, an inevitable condition of success.\nThe other consideration arises out of the findings of the learned trial judge as to credibility. He accepts the evidence of White as that of a truthful witness; and White received the impression from Gale, for whom he prepared the statement presented to Spillers, and whose confidence he seems to have fully enjoyed, that Gale, while very much averse to parting with so large a share of the property as the Spillers demanded, was not so keenly concerned as to the voting control, which White thought he would not have been unwilling to see vested in a voting trust. Again, the testimony of Gale and that of the respondent came into conflict on more than one point, and on these points the learned trial judge was not satisfied with Gale's testimony. These views of the trial judge were, as already mentioned, concurred in by the Court of Appeal; and in such circumstances it is not the office of this court to inquire what its own view might have been, had it heard the testimony. Criticism of no little force was directed by counsel for the appellants against the views of the learned trial judge as to the testimony of White and as to the testimony of Gale, but, to cite once again the phrase of Lord Haldane in Nocton v. Lord Ashburton[3], it would be little less than \" a rash proceeding \" on part of this court to set aside or disregard these findings, which primarily rest on the basis of the learned judge's views as to credibility\u2014views, moreover, confirmed and fortified, to adopt the suggestion of Mr. Justice Martin, by inferences fairly deducible from the documentary evidence.\nLoss of control was the point chiefly emphasized by Mr. Davis, but the appellants also rely upon the circumstance that, according to the plan ultimately adopted, the proprietorship of the elevator was vested in an entirely new company. As regards this circumstance, the view taken by the courts below seems to be the right one, namely, that this was a matter of machinery rather than something affecting the substance of The Terminal Company's \" project.\"\nThere remains the question of the personal liability of the directors. The obligation arising out of the letter of the 30th of August was, it is contended on behalf of the appellants, neither a debt \" existing \" at the time of the declaration and payment of the dividend, nor a debt \"thereafter contracted,\" and consequently the directors of The Terminal Company do not fall under the liability created by s. 82 of the Dominion Companies Act. Let it be conceded that, strictly, there was no existing debt. Does the obligation in favour of the respondent, which became exigible after the pertinent date, fall within the scope of the later phrase, \"debts thereafter contracted\"? The obligation took its rise from the letter of the 30th of August. It was a conditional obligation in the sense that the respondent was to become entitled to certain payments upon the fulfilment of certain conditions. The conditional contract was completely constituted as an executory contract before the declaration of the dividend, but the right to payment, conditional in its inception, became absolute\u2014ripened into a \"debt\"\u2014on the performance of the conditions. This debt was a contractual obligation resulting from the performance by the respondent of the conditions of the executory contract. It does not seem to be an abuse of language to describe such a contractual obligation as \" contracted \" at the time when it came into existence as a debt, through the performance of the conditions of the contract in which it originated.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Davis, Pugh, Davis, Hossie, Ralston & Lett.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Clarence Darling.\n[1] 36 B.C.

Defendant refused to accept delivery, objecting as to quality, and plaintiffs sued for damages for breach of contract. The descriptions of the skins in the contracts contained the words \u201cweight 7 to 15 lbs.\u201d or \u201cweight 8 to 15 lbs.\u201d A material number weighed over 15 lbs.\nHeld, plaintiffs could not recover; defendant was entitled to reject the skins offered for delivery, and was not confined to a remedy in damages for breach of warranty; the stipulations descriptive of the weights were material terms constituting conditions of delivery; there was no evidence sufficient to establish any custom of trade, usage or course of dealing by which defendant became bound to accept overweight skins; and the right to reject such skins involved or carried with it the right to refuse a quantity materially less than that ordered, or packages with which substantial quantities of goods which defendant was not liable to accept were intermingled.\nWhere sellers of goods do not satisfy the stipulated descriptions, the question whether or not this is a cause for rejection or gives rise only to a claim for damages, depends upon the intention of the parties as evidenced by the contract in the light of the surrounding circumstances.\nGraves v. Legg (9 Ex. R. 709, at p. 716), Bentsen v. Taylor ([1893] 2 Q.B. 274, at p. 281), Levy v. Green (5 Jur. N.S. 1245), and other cases, referred to.\nHeld, further, that there was nothing in subsequent agreements between the parties, or elsewhere in the negotiations, whereby defendant became bound to accept goods not of the descriptions required by the contracts of sale, or, by reason of its refusal to accept such goods, to forfeit certain allowances which it had received in accordance with such subsequent agreements.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario (58 Ont. L.R. 1) affirmed, with a minor variation.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs, and cross-appeal by the defendant, from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of Rose J.[2], dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 action, and holding the defendant entitled to recover $3,446.33 in respect of its counter-claim.\nThe plaintiffs sued for damages for refusal by the defendant to accept delivery of calfskins sold, under contracts, by the plaintiffs to the defendant. The defendant claimed that the skins offered for delivery were not according to contract, and, besides denying liability, set up a counterclaim for alleged defects in skins accepted and paid for and for alleged shortages and other matters. Rose J. dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action and dismissed defendant\u2019s counterclaim except as to the sum of $3,446.332. An appeal and cross-appeal to the Appellate Division was dismissed1. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the defendant cross-appealed, asking for an increase of the amount awarded on its counter-claim.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The judgment below was varied by reducing the amount allowed defendant on its counter-claim to $373.96, and subject thereto the appeal and cross-appeal were dismissed with costs.\nWallace Nesbitt K.C., R.S. Robertson K.C., and G.M. Huycke for the appellants.\nJ.W. Bain K.C. and M.L. Gordon for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The claims in controversy arise out of some unfortunate commercial transactions between the parties during the year 1920. The story may be briefly told.\nThe plaintiffs are a partnership, carrying on business in Paris and New York as dealers in skins. The defendant, a joint stock company, is a manufacturer of leather, and has a tannery at Aurora in Ontario. There are four contracts between the parties, described as the March, April, May and June contracts respectively, each expressed to be c.i.f. New York, viz., the contract of 22nd March, whereby the plaintiffs sold to the defendant about 10,000 green salted Paris and best French trimmed calfskins, weight 7 to 15 lbs., averaging about 10\u00bd to 11 lbs., at 80 cts. per pound, and about 10,000 best French calfskins, weight 8 to 15 lbs., averaging about 10\u00bd to 11 lbs., at 65 cts. per pound; the contract of 10th April, for the sale of 10,000 green salted Paris and best French trimmed calfskins, weight 7 to 15 lbs., averaging about 10\u00bd to 11 lbs., at 80 cts. per pound, and about 10,000 best French calfskins, weight 8 to 15 lbs., averaging about 10\u00bd to 11 lbs., at 65 cts per pound; the contract of 17th May, for the sale of about 5,000 green salted Paris and best French trimmed calfskins, weight 7 to 15 lbs. at 70 cts. per pound, and the contract of 1st June, for the sale of 10,000 green salted Paris and best French trimmed calfskins, weight 7 to 15 lbs., at 65 cts. per pound. The prices, in each case, were to be computed in United States currency. There is a dispute as to the existence of the April contract, which, although reduced to writing and signed by the plaintiffs, was not signed on behalf of the defendant, but the learned trial judge finds upon the evidence, including the correspondence in the case, that this contract was concluded, and that the parties became bound, and I see no reason to doubt the propriety of this finding. The defendant also, at one time, denied the June contract, but Mr. Bonisteel, the defendant\u2019s manager, acknowledged at the trial that it no longer remained in question.\nMr. Bonisteel, who negotiated the contracts, left Aurora on 7th April and sailed for Europe on the 9th. While absent he made the contracts of May and June. He returned to Aurora on or about 7th June. In the meantime some of the shipments of the goods contracted for had arrived, and been delivered to the defendant at Aurora. Other shipments were on the way. The defendant\u2019s storehouse was stocked with skins; but the prices had fallen, and the market was still going down.\nAs to the ordinary manner of shipment and payment, the plaintiffs, who were the shippers, tied the skins in bundles, each containing 6 to 8 skins, without any regard to uniformity of weights, so that all weights were mixed together in the bundles; shipped them to New York to the order of the shippers, and drew, at sight, on the defend- ant company at Aurora for the invoice prices, through their bank in Paris, with the shipping documents attached to the drafts. The drafts were forwarded for collection to La Banque d\u2019Hochelaga at Montreal, and were presented and collected, when the defendant paid them, by the Imperial Bank, agent of La Banque d\u2019Hochelaga at Aurora. When the defendant paid such a draft it sent the ocean bill of lading to the plaintiffs at New York, and the plaintiffs saw to the entry and receipt of the goods, and forwarded them by rail to the defendant at Aurora, the defendant paying the cartage and freight. When the draft was not paid, it was returned with the documents to the plaintiffs in New York, and thus they got possession of the goods. If, as sometimes happened, goods which were in the plaintiffs\u2019 warehouse in New York were dispatched to the defendant at Aurora, the plaintiffs made a sight draft in New York, with railway bill of lading attached, which the defendant would take up at Aurora, and receive the goods.\nMr. Bonisteel, having returned to Aurora, and finding that he had ordered in excess of his requirements, confirming a telegram, wrote to the plaintiffs\u2019 New York house, on 10th June, with regard to a shipment of 1,690 bundles from Havre, of which he had been advised, questioning the right of the plaintiffs to forward these skins, and he said:\nThis week, we have been getting cancellations of orders in every mail, and it will be impossible for us to take in any more skins, and we have asked you in this telegram to cable Paris not to ship these skins, or any other skins, and we would ask you to kindly cancel all our orders, as it will be impossible for us to take care of the drafts, and it will be of no use your Paris House making shipments to us when we will be unable to take care of the drafts, and we are obliged to accept the cancellations that are coming in.\nCorrespondence followed, and Mr. Cahn, the plaintiffs\u2019 New York manager, went to Aurora to see Mr. Bonisteel, on or about 12th June. The contracts and deliveries came under discussion, and in the result a memorandum was signed at Toronto, dated 16th June, by Mr. Cahn for the plaintiffs, and Mr. Bonisteel for the defendant, whereby, in order that all existing contracts between the parties should be filled, it was agreed that an allowance of 10 cts. per pound should be made on several parcels of skins invoiced at Paris, on 29th April, in the aggregate 15,222 skins, and an allowance of 15 cts. per pound on other skins in- voiced under five later invoices,18th May to 3rd June, covering 17,801 skins, and that the defendant would pay, within six weeks from date, for the shipments invoiced under date of 29th April, and, for all other shipments, within three months. At this time a considerable quantity of the skins contracted for in March had been received by the defendant, and carloads were coming forward from New York, or were waiting at Aurora for delivery to the consignees, Mr. Cahn says that Mr. Bonisteel was in a much agitated condition; that he had found his business in bad shape upon his return from Europe; that his bankers, upon whom he was dependent for money to retire the drafts, refused to make further advances for the purchase of skins, and that his customers were, owing to the condition of the market, cancelling the orders upon which he depended for his receipts. He says, as to the shipments which were on the cars at Aurora, or coming there, that Mr. Bonisteel volunteered to take these into his warehouse, and keep them separate until he could pay for them, but that he, Mr. Cahn, considered that\nin view of the fact that he told me that he was not getting any money from the bank, and his agitated condition, I thought that he was not any good any more, and I refused to touch the skins and rather stored them in New York.\nAccordingly, Mr. Cahn ordered these cars back to New York, and put the shipments into store there, where they remained, along with other skins shipped under the various contracts and unaccepted, until disposed of in the manner which will presently be disclosed. The defendant company did not meet the payments within the extended terms stipulated by the memorandum of 16th June, but, at the end of July, sent in claims in respect of the skins which it had received for damages or allowances due to the quality of those skins; the complaints relating especially to butcher scars. After some correspondence and interviews Mr. Bonisteel, on 24th August, had an interview with the plaintiffs at their office in New York, the result of which is stated in a memorandum of that date as follows:\nWith reference to the shipments of French Calfskins, on which drafts are being held by the Banque d\u2019Hochelaga, we had to-day another conference with Mr. Bonisteel, of the Collis Leather Co., and the following differences due to the Collis Leather Co. were established: 1. Excess shrinkage................................................................................................\n$10,294 64\nAllowances far quality, etc.......................................................................................\n17,661 18\nAllowances for quality, etc., in full settlement of all shipments made to the Collis Leather Co. to date.......................................................................................\n30,000 00\n$57,955 82\n2. Credit was established in favour of the Collis Leather Co. for $59,161.15 on the invoices now in abeyance, which include allowances of 10c. and 15c. per lb. respectively and excess shrinkages on these lots.\n3. It was agreed that the skins should be shipped within a reasonable time in accordance with the instructions received by the Collis Leather Co.\n4. As shipments of skins now in warehouse are made Alphonse Weil & Bros, will send a check to the Banque d\u2019Hochelaga, which will include the excess shrinkages and allowance as per paragraph 2, and also 20% of the amount of the original Paris Invoices for the skins shipped, this 20% to apply against shrinkages and allowances as per paragraph No. 1. Alphonse Weil & Bros. will instruct the Banque d\u2019Hochelaga to accept from the Collis Leather Co., in lieu of amount of draft, the difference between the amount of check sent to the Banque d\u2019Hochelaga and the amount of original draft, and to deliver upon payment B\/L for the respective shipment.\nThis memorandum was not signed by Mr. Bonisteel, although I think he admits that it sets out substantially the arrangement which was made, and, according to Mr. Cahn, the reason he gave for not signing it was that he was not permitted by his bank to sign any further agreements. There was however an additional claim of upwards of $7,000 which Mr. Bonisteel put forward, and which the plaintiffs were unwilling to allow, and Mr. Bonisteel says that he did not sign the memorandum because \u201cI was not satisfied as they would not allow me all my claims.\u201d The learned trial judge considered that the agreements of 16th June and 24th August, although relied upon by the defendant as evidence of admissions by the plaintiffs affecting the quality of the skins, were not in fact intended so to operate, but rather as allowances which, on account of the state of the market, the plaintiffs were willing to make conditionally, in so far as these agreements were carried out. Mr. Cahn however tells us upon discovery that the agreement of 24th August was a compromise settlement, and he reiterates in his testimony at the trial that the allowance was a compromise. Subsequently the plaintiffs made two shipments of 665 bundles of skins, on 26th August, and 784 bundles, on 15th September, which the defendant received and paid for, and, as to which, allowances were received by the defendant in accordance with the terms of the August agreement; but the defendant claimed that the skins comprised in these two shipments were not of contract quality, in that they were salt stained, butcher scarred, or had long shanks.\nThe market appears to have gone from bad to worse, and ultimately, in October, the defendant company temporarily closed its factory. In the meantime the skins, in respect of which the action is brought, remained with the plaintiffs in their New York warehouse, and there came a time when, on 29th September, the plaintiffs wrote the defendant that\nunless you will be here next week to approve of the skins we shall be obliged to take other steps to finally reach a conclusion of this matter.\nThen the defendant wrote the plaintiffs, on 4th October, reiterating or referring to its complaints with regard to the skins shipped subsequently to 24th August, and saying:\nAs we have already notified you, if the balance of the skins are as represented, we are, and always have been, willing to accept them, but if they are anything like the skins which have been recently shipped, we will not accept them as they are of no use to us.\nSubsequently, in October, Mr. Bonisteel with others, the defendant\u2019s employees, or acting under their instructions, came to New York for the purpose of examining the skins in store, and he obtained from Mr. Cahn, or from his office, an order to the warehouseman to permit the inspection. He, and those who were with him, did inspect the skins on that occasion, and, after a day and a half, he went to the plaintiffs\u2019 office and told them that he would not accept the skins, as they were not of correct quality. And, on 2nd December following, this action was begun.\nThe defendant, as I understand the case, has accepted and paid for all the calfskins of the March contract, except 1,150 Paris and best French trimmed, weighing 12,623 lbs., at 80 cts. per pound; also all the skins purchased by the April contract, except 5,045 trimmed, weighing 54,001 lbs., at 80 cts. per pound, and 3,197 best French calfskins, weighing 40,074 lbs. at 65 cts. per pound. None of the skins provided for by the other two contracts has been accepted or paid for, and in the action the plaintiffs seek to establish a tender of the skins which were not accepted; that the defendant refused to accept delivery thereof or to pay therefor, and that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover, in respect of the unaccepted skins appertaining to each contract, the prices stipulated therefor respectively in the original contracts, less $53,338.60 which the plaintiffs ultimately realized upon the sale of the unaccepted skins, the total claim amounting to $141,852.57.\nThe defendant, having finally rejected the skins which remained in the plaintiffs\u2019 warehouse, and which were examined on the defendant\u2019s behalf in October, the plaintiffs disposed of them in the following manner. They sold all the trimmed skins, under 12 lbs. in weight, to Albert Trostel and Sons Company, of Milwaukee, and all the trimmed skins, over 12 lbs. in weight, to the Monarch Leather Company of Chicago, and they reshipped to Paris all the untrimmed skins with heads and short shanks, where they sold them; Mr. Cahn stating, as to the latter, that they were too light for the trade in America at the time; that the market had collapsed, and that they were sure of getting more money in France where the market was high. This disposition of the skins involved the breaking up of the bundles, and distribution according to the weights of the skins, and it was found that a very considerable number of them weighed in excess of 15 lbs. each, the limit fixed by the defendant\u2019s contracts. The invoices to the Monarch Co. show that there were no less than 787 heavy skins, that is, exceeding 16 lbs. The evidence further shows that the skins were about equally distributed as to weights, and that therefore, taking the upper limit as 15 lbs., there would have been a proportionate increase of heavies. The learned trial judge put his finding in this way. He said that:\nOn the weighing it was found that there were 8,020 skins weighing over twelve pounds each and that of these 714 were over sixteen pounds, running up to twenty pounds, in some instances; and a witness says, and it seems probable, that of the remainder of the 8,020 a good many weighed between fifteen and sixteen pounds. The witness said that approximately there were as many skins of any given weight as of any other; and it is suggested by counsel that from this evidence one can ascertain the number that there were over the fifteen pounds, which was the limit in the defendants\u2019 case, but not exceeding the sixteen pounds, which was the limit on the sale to the Trostel (sic) Company. This would be to take the evidence rather too literally. It may, however, be assumed that the number of those that weighed over fifteen pounds each was considerably in excess of 714; and it may, and ought to be found that the skins weighing over fifteen pounds were distributed throughout the various consignments. He found that there was no custom of the trade entitling the vendor to deliver skins not of the weight contracted for, and that, in the absence of such a custom, the fact that a substantial number of heavy skins were mixed with the contract skins, in the bundles which were tendered for inspection and delivery, justified the defendant\u2019s refusal to accept, and he referred to the case of Levy v. Green[3]. In that case the vendor had sent a crate containing a deficient quantity of the particular goods ordered, along with other goods not ordered, packed in the same crate. He debited the whole contents of the crate, which the defendant refused to receive upon the ground that they were out of time; but, at the trial, the objection was taken that the defendant was not bound to take any part of the goods, because of the manner in which they were sent, accompanied by goods not ordered. In the Queen\u2019s Bench[4] Lord Campbell C.J., and Wightman J., considered that the purchaser was not bound to accept, while Coleridge and Erle JJ., were of the contrary opinion. But, in the Exchequer Chamber[5], Martin, Bramwell and Watson BB. and Willes and Byles JJ. were unanimous in holding, with Lord Campbell and Wightman J. that the purchaser had the right to reject the whole. It was for a like reason that the present action failed at the trial, and the judgment was unanimously upheld by the Appellate Division.\nThe plaintiffs (appellants) now object, upon appeal, that the judgment is erroneous for various reasons. They say that the presence of overweight skins did not entitle the defendant to reject; that there was no breach of condition, but at most a breach of warranty, on account of which the defendant\u2019s remedy was in damages, and that, in any case, according to the general course of dealing and conduct of the parties, the defendant had no right to reject for overweight. I am of the opinion, however, that the stipulations of the several contracts, descriptive of the weights of the skins which were to be supplied, were material terms, constituting conditions of delivery. The clause which is common to all the contracts, 7 to 15 lbs. (or 8 to 15 lbs.), obviously defines by reference to weights the kind or character of the skins which were intended to be shipped; moreover the word \u201ccalfskins,\u201d in itself, is not apt to include skins weighing more than 15 lbs.; these, up to 25 lbs., are, according to the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, classified in the trade as \u201ckips.\u201d The plaintiffs have therefore not satisfied the stipulated descriptions. Whether or not their non-compliance is a cause for rejection, or gives rise only to a claim for damages, must depend upon the intention of the parties as evidenced by the contracts and the facts in proof. See the judgment of Parke B., in Graves v. Legg[6]. Bowen L.J., said in Bentsen v. Taylor[7]:\nThere is no way of deciding that question except by looking at the contract in the light of the surrounding circumstances, and then making up one\u2019s mind whether the intention of the parties, as gathered from the instrument itself, will best be carried out by treating the promise as a warranty sounding only in damages, or as a condition precedent by the failure to perform which the other party is relieved of his liability. In order to decide this question of construction, one of the first things you would look to is, to what extent the accuracy of the statement\u2014the truth of what is promised\u2014would be likely to affect the substance and foundation of the adventure which the contract is intended to carry out. There, again, it might be necessary to have recourse to the jury. In the case of a charterparty it may well be that such a test could only be applied after getting the jury to say what the effect of a breach of such conditions would be on the substance and foundation of the adventure; not the effect of the breach which has in fact taken place, but the effect likely to be produced on the foundation of the adventure by any such breach of that portion of the contract.\nSee also per Fletcher Moulton L.J., in Wallis v. Pratt[8], whose judgment was upheld by the House of Lords[9]. Applying these principles to the interpretation of the contracts in question, I find myself in accord with the view, which I conceive to be implied, if not expressed, in the judgments of the courts below, that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover is dependent upon the skins offered for delivery having the descriptive weights. There is no evidence sufficient to establish any custom of trade, usage or course of dealing by which the defendant became bound to accept skins not within the description by which the goods are defined in the documents, and the right to reject such skins involves or carries with it the right to refuse a quantity materially less than that ordered, or packages with which substantial quantities of goods which the defendant is not liable to accept are intermingled. The proof and the findings leave no doubt as to the materiality of the quantity of the skins which were overweight. The court is, of course, always very careful, in the interpretation of commercial contracts, not to introduce a variation. A kindred question was recently considered in this court in California Prune and Apricot Growers v. Baird & Peters[10]. See also the well known case of Bowes v. Shand[11].\nThen it is said that the defendant, although it may originally have had the right to reject, lost that right by reason of what occurred subsequently; that, although the defendant received benefits under the agreements of 16th June and 24th August by way of reduction in the prices, these reductions were made only conditionally, and that the defendant should at least be chargeable with the original contract prices of the two shipments which were made from New York subsequently to the agreement of 24th August, and which the defendant received at Aurora and paid for in accordance with the agreements of 16th June and 24th August. I do not consider however that these two agreements were intended to supersede the original agreements of March, April, May and June, under which the goods were shipped. The agreement of 16th June expressly declares that it is made in order that the existing contracts shall be fulfilled. It provides for the stipulated allowances of 10 cts. and 15 cts., and for payment to be made within six weeks and three months from the date of the agreement. The agreement of 24th August, according to its terms, establishes allowances for excess shrinkage and for quality as to the shipments which had already been received and paid for by the defendant, amounting in all to $57,985.82. As to the remaining invoices, which include the goods now in question, as well as the two shipments which were made later in August and in September, credit was established in favour of the defendant for $59,161.15, which includes the allowances resulting from the agreement of 16th June and for excess shrinkage upon the lots to be delivered, and it provides moreover that, as the shipments were made of the skins in warehouse, the plaintiffs would pay to the bank the excess shrinkages and allowances upon the invoices outstanding on 24th August, and, in addition, 20% of the amount of the original Paris invoices for the skins shipped, to be applied in reduction of the general allowance of the $57,955.82 above mentioned; the plaintiffs and defendant thus to contribute proportionately to the payment of the original drafts, as the shipments were received by the defendant. There is no expression either in the agreement of 16th June, or in the written memorandum expressive of the agreement of 24th August, which makes them, or either of them, conditional upon the defendant accepting and paying for the entire quantity of the skins which the plaintiffs were holding in their New York warehouse, and which had been shipped from Paris in fulfillment of the original contracts. There are, however, some expressions that these agreements were intended to operate conditionally; they are comprised in three passages. Mr. Cahn, upon discovery, when asked as to whether he remained bound by the agreement of 16th June, considered the question to be one of law; he referred it to the solicitor who was representing him at the discovery, and the solicitor answered:\nThis was a conditional arrangement providing that Mr. Bonisteel do so and so, they were prepared to do so and so.\nMr. Cahn\u2019s answer was accordingly in the negative. Mr. Copeland, the plaintiffs\u2019 accountant, who was present at the meeting of 24th August, when asked in cross-examination as to whether the plaintiffs had agreed to pay the allowance of $58,000, answered:\nProviding Mr. Bonisteel, The Collis Leather Company agreed to take delivery and pay the outstanding drafts.\nQ. And pay the outstanding drafts for the goods which were then in the warehouse, were they?\nA. Yes, under various contracts.\nMr. Bonisteel, in his cross-examination with reference to the agreement of 24th August, gave the following answers:\nQ. And they (the plaintiffs) were, as we saw yesterday, if they allowed any amount on your claims, to deduct the amount of the allowances proportionately from later invoices; that was the method of dealing with it that was discussed?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. And it meant this, that unless you took the rest of the skins you did not get the allowance; that is so, isn\u2019t it?\nA. That was the understanding. The learned trial judge, in considering the evidence as to the defective character of the skins, said:\nThe defendants suggest also that in a memorandum signed by the parties at Toronto on June 16 (ex.7), and in another prepared by the plaintiffs in New York on August 24, which Mr. Bonisteel refused to sign, there are admissions that the skins were defective; but, as a matter of fact, the documents evidence merely certain allowances that the plaintiffs were willing to make if the defendants fulfilled their contracts and took in and paid for all the skins shipped from France. The transactions between the parties had been extensive and mutually satisfactory; the plaintiffs had the skins on hand, and no market at nearly the price that the defendant had agreed to pay was available; it was very doubtful whether the defendants were able to pay for the skins at the contract prices, their market for leather being what it was; and whether they could pay or not, it was fair and businesslike on the part of the plaintiffs to give them some extra time and to share the loss with them. This was the purpose of the arrangements made in June and August; and the allowances conditionally, and only conditionally, agreed upon in respect of earlier shipments and of goods still to be delivered cannot be treated as admissions of defects either in the. goods theretofore delivered or in those still to be delivered.\nIt is however to be inferred that the learned judge did not intend these observations to affect the defendant\u2019s right to the allowances which it had actually received upon the two shipments of 26th August (665 bundles) and 15th September (784 bundles), which were invoiced from New York and paid for subsequently to the agreement of 24th August, and as to which the deductions were actually allowed on the invoices and settled. Those he regarded, and I think rightly, as concluded transactions, because he did not find the plaintiffs entitled to recover the allowances which they had paid and deducted upon these invoices. Of course the defendant was, by the terms of the agreements, to receive its allowances upon future payments, and, if it did not make those payments, there was nothing upon which the deductions could operate; in that sense the allowances were conditional, but I think that is all that is intended or involved in the evidence and findings as to the conditional nature of the agreements. The benefits which the defendant received were those sanctioned by the agreements. They were spread over the invoices, and accrued only as payments were made, but the subject-matter of the original contracts of sale remained constant, and I find nothing in the arrangements of June and August, or elsewhere in the negotiations, whereby the defendant became bound to accept goods not of the descriptions required by the con- tracts of sale, or, by reason of its refusal to accept such goods, to forfeit allowances which it had received.\nFor these reasons I am in agreement with the courts below that the action fails.\nBut there is also a cross appeal. The defendant counter-claimed for damages on account of shortages, defects, inferior quality and differences in weight of the skins delivered. The learned trial judge considered these claims very carefully, and he came to the conclusion that they could not be maintained, except as to the two items amounting to $3,446.33, to which I shall refer again. He thought that generally the claims themselves were put forward rather by reason of the defendant\u2019s anxiety to escape or mitigate its losses, due to the collapse of the market at a time when it had on hand an excessive quantity of stock purchased at the higher prices previously prevailing, than to the quality of (the good\u2019s delivered, or any confidence which it had in the reality of its claims; and he expressed his preference for the testimony of Mr. Cahn, the plaintiffs\u2019 leading witness, where it differed from that of Mr. Bonisteel, the defendant\u2019s manager, and his findings were accepted unanimously by the Appellate Division. In these circumstances, while, speaking from the evidence as it appears upon the record, I might not be indisposed to modify in some particulars the findings which have been enunciated, I do not think that they can be disturbed consistently with the principles which regulate this court in the consideration of concurrent findings, or that any useful purpose will be served by reviewing at length the massive evidence which is comprised in the case. SS. Hontestroom v. SS. Sagaporack and SS. Durham Castle [12].\nAs to the sum of $3,446.33, for which the defendant recovered judgment upon its counter\u2011claim, the item, except as to $308.61, is admitted as an original liability for shrinkage, but it would appear that the learned judge failed to take into account the allowances made for shrinkage of which the defendant had already received the benefit in the invoices of 26th August and 15th September. I am indebted to the appellants\u2019 factum for a careful analysis of the accounts, and computation of the difference which this involves, and, if the point had similarly been drawn to the attention of the trial judge, I am sure it would not have been overlooked. It appears that the amount which the defendant had received by way of reduction from the Paris invoices in respect of the August and September shipments. is $2,793.76, which of course it cannot also recover under its counter-claim. Also there is an item of $308.61, charged in the particulars of the statement of claim for freight prepaid on the 784 bundles of skins which were shipped in September. This item is proved by Mr. Copeland, the plaintiffs\u2019 accountant, and should apparently be taken in reduction of the amount found on the counter-claim, thus reducing that amount as follows:\nTrial judge\u2019s finding.............................................................................................\n$3,446 33\nIncluded in allowances of 26th August and 15th September..........................\n$2,763 76\nPrepaid freight.....................................................................................................\n308 61 3,072 37\nBalance.................................................................................................................\n$ 373 96\nto which the amount found for the defendant upon the counter-claim should be reduced.\nWhile this leads to a variation of the judgment in the appellants\u2019 favour by a comparatively small amount, I would not therefore allow them the costs, because I think the amount should have been rectified upon the minutes before the trial judge, and that, if the matter had been so presented, an appeal would have been unnecessary; moreover the appellants did not limit their appeal, as authorized by the rules, to the minor point upon which they succeed.\nThe appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs, and the judgment should be varied by reducing the amount found upon the counter-claim to $373.96.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.

They lived together in a shack on S.\u2019s farm. It was heated by a stove, which gave trouble by smoking, which S., assisted by plaintiff, tried to remedy. One afternoon plaintiff, feeling ill, went to bed, S. sitting up to look after the stove. Plaintiff awoke two days later with his feet frozen. S. was found dead on the floor. The cause of his death was matter of conjecture. The fire in the stove had burned out. Plaintiff claimed damages from S.\u2019s estate.\nHeld, plaintiff could not recover; S. did all a reasonable man would have done to render the shack safe; assuming that S. committed an error of judgment in thinking (as apparently plaintiff thought also) that the cause of the trouble was in the stove (which S. proposed to replace by a new one as soon as weather permitted) and in not suspecting it to be in the \u201croof-jack\u201d (serving as a chimney), such an error of judgment would not support a charge of negligence under the circumstances; moreover, if there was an obvious danger, it was as obvious to plaintiff as to S.; and plaintiff, with every means of information that S. possessed, voluntarily remained in the shack; on the evidence, it was not merely a case of knowledge by plaintiff of a possible danger, but of free acceptance by him of any risk there might have been in the existing conditions.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan (20 Sask. L.R. 468) reversed.\nAPPEAL by the defendant, the administrator of the estate of Matias Sigerseth, deceased, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan[1] which, reversing judgment of Mackenzie J., held plaintiff entitled to recover damages from the defendant for personal injuries resulting, as alleged, from defective conditions in the deceased\u2019s shack, where plaintiff, who was employed by the deceased as a farm labourer, lived with the deceased. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed with costs. As to a small item for arrears of wages the judgment below for the plaintiff was not disturbed.\nC. E. Gregory K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. S. Rankin for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014The respondent, Erling Pederson, after having failed in the trial court (Mackenzie J.), succeeded in obtaining from the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan a judgment for substantial damages for personal injuries. His action was brought against the administrator of the estate of Matias Sigerseth, deceased, who now appeals to this court.\nPederson is a young Norwegian who, in the late autumn of 1924, was employed as a farm labourer by the deceased, a man said to have been sixty-eight years old, with whom he resided in a shack on the latter\u2019s farm. The shack was a wooden structure, divided into two rooms, a kitchen, and a bedroom with two beds, one for the respondent and the other for the deceased. There was no door between the kitchen and the bedroom, but only an opening. In the kitchen there was a coal stove or range with a seven-inch smoke pipe which rose straight from the stove and thence was carried along the ceiling to the middle of the room where it went through the roof. There was no chimney, but on the roof, where the smoke pipe passed, there was what is called a roof-jack, which served as a chimney, and was itself enclosed in a wooden box filled with cement or sand from which the pipe emerged.\nFor some time previous to the 16th of December, the coal stove had smoked rather badly, and to let out the smoke the deceased used to open the outside door slightly. Together with the respondent, he sought to discover the cause of the trouble, and in the beginning of the month the two men took the stove and pipes outside and cleaned them, afterwards setting them up in their previous position. They did not go up on the roof to inspect the roof-jack. There appears to have been some improvement, but, in the middle of December, a spell of extremely cold weather set in, and the stove again gave trouble.\nIn the afternoon of Tuesday, December 16, the respondent complained of a headache, and the deceased advised him to go to bed, saying that he would do his work that evening, and that he would also sit up to look after the stove. The respondent, therefore, went to bed, fully dressed, and with three blankets over him. The deceased was then sitting by the stove and the shack door was partly open to let out the smoke.\nThe respondent states that he awoke only in the afternoon of Thursday, the 18th of December. His two feet were frozen. He arose and went to the kitchen to get some food. There was then no fire in the stove, the coal being fully burned out, and on the kitchen floor, in front of the stove and facing the door, he found the dead and frozen body of Sigerseth. The shack door was closed. A little later, the son of a neighbour came to the shack and brought the respondent to his father\u2019s house, from which he was taken to the hospital. There is no doubt his injuries were of a serious nature.\nThe evidence is that on the 16th and following days the weather was extremely cold, and it is stated that the temperature reached 40 degrees below zero. On the 19th of December a hardware merchant and undertaker, named Saunders, who had sold the stove to the deceased, and who says it was a good stove, although a little hard to clean out, went to the shack to remove the body. He states that he noticed something on top of the roof-jack which looked like a rag stuffed into it. With the aid of a ladder he climbed up and examined it; it was like frost, and the chimney or roof-jack was filled as though the smoke had condensed and frozen. In appearance, he says, it was kind of white, almost like snow, with a small hole or vent, about an inch in diameter. He is unable to form any idea how long it had been that way. In cross-examination he expresses the opinion that it was the cold, during the few days of extreme cold weather, that caused the obstruction. He is asked by the appellant\u2019s counsel:\nQ. And you would think it was probable during these two or three cold days immediately preceding the time you were there this filled up?\nA. We\u2019ll, I would imagine it would be, although I am not in a position to say, of course.\nThe inquiry was not pushed further, and it is a matter of conjecture whether the condition observed by Saunders, on the 19th, existed on or prior to the 16th of December. What caused Sigerseth\u2019s death is also a matter of conjecture. The physician who was called at the trial never saw his body, no post-mortem examination was made, and his assertion that the deceased died from suffocation by carbon monoxide and freezing is only a surmise from what he was told by others.\nThe respondent testifies that the deceased \u201cwas doing the best he could under the cold weather,\u201d that \u201che tried his best to keep the fire going,\u201d that he \u201cwas doing what he thought best around the stove under the cold weather\u201d and that \u201che was always careful about the fires.\u201d Conditions in regard to the stove became worse when the extreme cold weather set in, and the deceased then spoke of going to town to get a new stove but was prevented from doing so by the excessive cold. It is impossible to read the respondent\u2019s testimony\u2014and he is the only witness who can speak of what happened prior to the accident\u2014without coming to the conclusion that the deceased made every effort to remedy the smoking condition of the stove, and the respondent joined with him in this attempt. Apparently none of them suspected that the cause of the trouble was elsewhere than in the stove, or that the roof-jack had anything to do with it. That the respondent was fully aware of the conditions which prevailed, and nevertheless consented to remain in the shack with the deceased cannot be questioned.\nUnder these circumstances, the learned trial judge considered that a case of negligence was not made out and he dismissed the action. In his opinion, when the respondent went to bed indisposed on the afternoon of the 16th of December, the effect of the trouble and its possible dangers were as obvious to him as they were to the deceased. The tatter\u2019s duty to the former was to take reasonable precautions to see that the house was kept warm enough to prevent the respondent from perishing from the cold on the one hand and from suffocating from the coal gas on the other. To meet this situation the deceased, instead of going to bed, stayed up by the fire to tend and watch it. That, in the opinion of the learned trial judge, was a reasonable course for him to take and as much as could well be expected of him. To his mind, the whole case was one of pure misadventure.\nThe Court of Appeal reversed this judgment and awarded substantial damages to the respondent. In the opinion of Mr. Justice McKay, with whom the other judges concurred, the smoking condition was caused by the gradual\u00ab accumulation of the condensed smoke and frost at the top opening of the roof-jack during the cold weather. He held that when the cold weather came and the stove was smoking greatly, a dangerous situation was created and it was then the duty of the deceased to take all reasonable steps to remove this danger. The roof-jack and not merely the pipes and stove should have been cleaned by the deceased.\nWith great respect, and in so far as this is a finding that the deceased did not take reasonable steps to discharge the duty he owed the respondent, I am unable, on a careful reading of the testimony, and especially of that of the respondent, to come to the same conclusion as the Court of Appeal. The roof-jack served as a chimney, and neither the respondent nor the deceased ever suspected that there was in it any obstruction to the escape of the smoke. It is mere conjecture\u2014and a doubtful one at the best\u2014 whether the condition observed on the 19th December existed before the cold spell set in, Assuming that the deceased committed an error of judgment after the cleaning of the stove and pipes in thinking that the cause of the trouble was in the stove which he proposed to replace by a new one as soon as the weather would permit, such an error of judgment would not support a charge of negligence under the circumstances. In my opinion, the deceased did all that a reasonable man would have done to render the shack safe as a residence for the respondent and himself. If the respondent\u2019s suggestion that his death was caused by suffocation from coal gas and freezing be justified, he sacrificed his life in looking after the fire while the respondent slept. It is a case of misadventure and not of negligence.\nMoreover, if, as the respondent contends, there was an obvious danger, this danger was as obvious to the respondent as to the deceased. And the respondent, with every means of information that the deceased possessed, voluntarily remained in the shack and slept there after the cleaning of the pipes. On the evidence, it is not merely a case of knowledge by the respondent of a possible danger, but of free acceptance by him of any risk there might have been in the existing conditions.\nI cannot see any ground for holding the appellant liable in damages for the respondent\u2019s injuries.\nThe Court of Appeal granted the respondent $28.85 for arrears of wages. This item, which was claimed by the action, was apparently overlooked by the learned trial judge when he dismissed the respondent\u2019s demand in toto. I would not disturb the judgment of the Court of Appeal in that respect, but allowance of this small item should not affect the disposition of the costs of this litigation, for the respondent fails as to the principal object of his action.\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs throughout against the respondent, and restrict the latter\u2019s recovery to the sum of $28.85, to be offset against the costs which he must pay.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Buckles & Graham.\nSolicitor for the respondent: R. A. Hutchon.\n[1] 20 Sask. L.R. 468; [1926] 2 W.W.R. 205.\n",

(the appellant) for damages for injuries suffered through an automobile collision. Judgment against A. by the Appellate Division, Ont., was reversed by this Court, which allowed A.\u2019s appeal with costs ([1926] S.C.R.575). The Registrar declined to tax costs to A., on the ground that the solicitors, who nominally acted for him in carrying on the appeal, were not in fact retained by him or on his behalf, but were employed by an insurance company, which had insured A. against liability, to defend the action and to prosecute the appeal to this Court, and that A. was under no personal liability to such solicitors for the costs of the appeal, and was, therefore, not in a position to claim indemnification by plaintiffs for such costs. A. appealed.\nHeld, A. should recover his costs from plaintiffs; on the evidence the insurer instructed its solicitors to defend the action on behalf of A., who, from the course of the proceedings, must have employed the solicitors or sanctioned their carrying on of his defence, so as to become personally liable for their costs, unless there was an agreement binding on the solicitors excluding such liability; no such agreement was established; the fact that there was an obligation by the insurer to pay the solicitors\u2019 costs, and that the solicitors would naturally apply in the first instance to the insurer, as being ultimately liable to pay the costs by reason of A.\u2019s right of indemnification against it, would not exclude A.\u2019s liability.\nAdams v. London Improved Motor Coach Builders Ltd., [1921] 1 K.B.495, applied; Rex v. Archbishop of Canterbury, [1903] 1 K.B.289, at 295, referred to; Ryan v. McGregor, 58 Ont. L.R. 213, unless distinguishable from the present decision, and so far as inconsistent therewith, overruled.\nAPPEAL by the defendant Armand from a ruling of the Registrar holding him not entitled to recover from the plaintiffs the costs of the appeal to this Court awarded him by the judgment of this Court[1].\nThe plaintiffs sued Armand and Wilcox for damages for injuries suffered by the plaintiffs through an automobile collision. The trial judge held Wilcox alone to blame. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario held Armand jointly liable with Wilcox[2]. Armand appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, who allowed his appeal with costs1.\nThe grounds taken by the Registrar for declining to tax Armand\u2019s costs, and the circumstances of the case bearing on the question now to be decided, are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note.\nA.C. Heighington for the appellant.\nD.O. Cameron for the respondents Carr.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The appellant Armand appeals from a ruling of the Registrar holding him not entitled to recover from the respondents the costs of the appeal to this court awarded him by the judgment reported in [1926] S.C.R., at p. 575.\nThe ground taken by the Registrar for declining to tax these costs to the appellant is that the solicitors, who nominally acted for him in carrying on the appeal, were not in fact retained by him or on his behalf, but were employed by the British Traders\u2019 Insurance Company (with whom the appellant was insured) to defend the action brought against him and to prosecute the appeal to this court, and that the appellant was under no personal liability to such solicitors for the costs of the appeal and was, therefore, not in a position to claim indemnification by the respondents for such costs; and Ryan v. McGregor[3], is cited in support of these conclusions.\nUpon careful consideration of all the material before us, we are satisfied that the insurance company instructed its own solicitors to defend the action not on its behalf but on behalf of the appellant, thus implementing its obligation \u201cto defend in the name and on behalf of the insured any civil actions, etc.\u201d The solicitors so instructed entered an appearance in which they style themselves \u201csolicitors for the defendant\u201d (the appellant). For so doing his authority was necessary and was undoubtedly obtained. Their character as defendant\u2019s solicitors they maintained throughout the litigation in which, from time to time, the appellant personally took part by making affidavits, giving evidence, executing a bond, etc. From this course of conduct his employment of the solicitors who appeared on his behalf, or his sanctioning their carrying on his defence, is the only proper inference; and whether it should be taken that the insurance company, in instructing its solicitors to defend the action, etc., acted as agent for the defendant, or that he personally so employed the solicitors, their retainer as his solicitors in a manner binding upon him admits of no doubt. Such retainer or employment carries with it personal liability of the defendant (appellant) for the costs reasonably incurred by the solicitors pursuant to it, unless there was a contract or agreement binding on the solicitors excluding such liability. In that connection the Registrar says:\nI have reviewed the evidence and my conclusion is that Armand, when he came in to sign the necessary papers in connection with this appeal, did not expect he would be called upon personally to pay any costs * * *.\nThe language used by the taxing officer in Ryan v. McGregor[4] referred to in my reasons is applicable in this case, viz: \u201cI think that there was at least an implied agreement to the effect that the cost of defending the action should be assumed and paid by the company, and that the defendant should be under no liability with respect thereto.\u201d\nI do not say that if the insurance company failed to pay the costs, and Armand had the means of paying the same, that the solicitors would have been unable on the facts of this case to collect the same from Armand. I do not think it necessary for the purpose of my judgment to make any finding as to this.\nThis is obviously not a definite finding that there was an agreement relieving the defendant\u2011appellant of all liability to his solicitors such as must be established by the respondent\u2011plaintiffs, if they would on that ground avoid payment of party and party costs to the successful appellant. Adams v. London Improved Motor Coach Builders, Ltd.[5] The evidence is not very definite or very precise. In our opinion it clearly falls short of establishing any agreement binding on the solicitors that they should not in any event look for payment of their costs to the appellant. No doubt there was an obligation on the part of the insurance company to pay the defendant\u2019s solicitors their reasonable costs. Adapting to the circumstances of the present case the language of Atkin L.J. in the Adams case[6], at page 504: Nevertheless there is nothing inconsistent in that obligation co-existing with an obligation on the part of the defendant to remunerate the solicitors. Naturally, as a matter of business, the solicitors would, we have no doubt, apply in the first instance to the insurance company, as being the persons ultimately liable to pay the costs as between all parties\u2014that is to say, the persons who would have to indemnify the defendant against the costs. But that does not exclude the liability of the insured, and it seems to us not in the least to affect the position that the client may be liable although there may be a third person to indemnify the client. It appears to us that that state of things would account for the whole of the evidence that was given. But we feel satisfied of this: that upon the direct evidence in the case it would be wrong to draw the conclusion that there was an express bargain that the defendant was not to be liable to \u2018the solicitors for the costs incurred; and, quite apart from the express evidence that no such arrangement was made, it appears to us that there was no evidence given on behalf of the respondents that an express arrangement to that effect had in fact been made.\nUpon the facts in evidence the appellant\u2019s right to recover from the respondents the costs of his appeal awarded to him by the judgment of this court cannot, we think, be denied. The decision in Adams v. London Improved Motor Coach Builders, Ltd6, is directly in point and conclusive in his favour. See, too, the judgment of Romer L.J., at p. 295, in Rex v. Archbishop of Canterbury[7].\nIn so far as the decision in Ryan v. McGregor[8] may not be consistent with this conclusion we are unable to follow it. That case, however, may perhaps be distinguishable on the ground that the court there regarded the finding of fact of the taxing officer as definitely negativing any retainer of the solicitors by the defendant and as not open to review because of the circumstances under which the matter came before the court.\nThe appeal will, accordingly, be allowed with costs, including the costs of and incidental to the application before the Registrar.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Symons, Heighington & Shaver.\nSolicitor for the respondents Carr: D.O.

The premises sublet were described as floor spaces, the superficial dimensions being ascertained by the measurement of horizontal distances along the interior surfaces of the walls and partitions. A standpipe, for conducting through the building water from the city's system for fire protection, which passed through plaintiff's premises, burst thereon, in a part used for storage purposes, and plaintiff's goods were damaged by water. Plaintiff sued defendant for damages, alleging that the pipe froze and burst through defendant's negligence in failing to heat the premises, in failing to turn off the water and drain the pipe during the cold weather, or in failing to take certain other precautions. The lease to plaintiff contained no provision for heating. There were no means within the building of turning off the water. There was a valve at the standpipe connection in an area under the street sidewalk and perhaps another at the junction with the city water main, but it was not shown that defendant had control of these.\nHeld, defendant was not liable; there was no evidence that in fact defendant had possession of, or exercised any control over, those portions of the pipe which were within plaintiff's premises; it could not be said that, by reason of the description of the demised premises as floor spaces of defined areas within walls and partitions, the pipe was not included in the description; Hargroves v. Hartopp ([1905] 1 K.B. 472), Dunster v. Hollis ([1918] 2 K.B. 795), and Cockburn v. Smith ([1924] 2 K.B. 119), distinguished. There was no room for application of the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher (L.R. 3 H.L. 330), either in its general effect or subject to any of its modifications.\nThe fact that a radiator in plaintiff's office was supplied with heat from a small furnace which defendant operated did not justify an implication that defendant undertook to keep the room where the break occurred free from frost or its consequences.\nAnglin C.J.C., while concurring in the reasons above indicated, also agreed with the grounds taken by Macdonald C.J.A. and M. A. Macdonald J.A. in the court below ([1926] 3 W.W.R. 129).\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia ([1926] 3 W.W.R. 129) affirme.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia [1] which allowed an appeal taken by the defendant from the judgment of Morrison J. in favour of the plaintiff in an action for damages to plaintiff's goods caused by the bursting of a standpipe on premises leased by the plaintiff from the defendant. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nI.F. Hellmuth K.C. and W. Zimmerman for the appellant.\nR. S. Robertson K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The defendant (respondent) company, being lessee of the three story building belonging to the Crane Company, situate at the corner of Alexander and Carrall streets at Vancouver, sublet parts of the building to the plaintiff (appellant) company by indenture of 1st September, 1923, in pursuance, as stated in the instrument, of the Leaseholds Act of British Columbia. The premises sublet are described as floor spaces, the superficial dimen- sions being ascertained by the measurement of horizontal distances along the interior surfaces of the walls and partitions. The plaintiff company occupied a part of the ground floor, where its office and business headquarters were, and, for warehouse purposes, the greater part of the first floor, and all of the second floor. The defendant company occupied those parts of the building which were not demised to the plaintiff until November, 1924, when it moved out.\nThere was no provision in the plaintiff's lease for the heating of the building, but in fact there was a very small, coal burning, hot water furnace in the basement, from which the water pipes extended to the ground floor, and to one of the rooms occupied by the defendant on the first floor, but there was only one radiator in the premises sublet to the plaintiff, and that was in the office on the ground floor. The defendant kept up the fire in the furnace after moving, but, during the latter part of December, the weather was, for the greater part of the time, according to the record of the Meteorological Service, below freezing, and the temperature fell as low as 8 degrees on the 17th. There were some complaints, during this time, that the plaintiff's radiator was cold, and there is a difference in the testimony as to whether or not the fire was not occasionally allowed to go out, but the defendant maintains that it was kept burning. The learned trial judge finds that the furnace was not kept up to a sufficient degree of heat to prevent frost in the building, and that may be taken as established; but it seems moreover to be proved that the heating equipment of the building was insufficient, in the existing conditions, even when operated to its capacity, to exclude frost in those parts of the upper stories where there were no radiators. About the 21st, the gravity tank on the third floor froze and burst, and was renewed by the defendant, and there were also some taps frozen in the plaintiff's premises on the second floor.\nThere was in the building what is called a standpipe, the purpose of which was to conduct through the building water from the city's water system for purposes of fire protection. It is not shown whether or not the standpipe was introduced in compliance with municipal regulations, but it is said that the water could not be shut off from it without permission from the city; it is independent of the pipes which supply the building with water for other purposes, and terminates on the third floor in a dead end, affording no circulation or outlet, except by use of the hose attachments. The area under the sidewalk of Carrall St., on the west side of the building, is excavated, and it was in this excavated area that the standpipe was connected with the branch leading to the building from the water main in Carrall St. There is a valve in the area, and perhaps another at the intake from the main, where the water may be turned off, but there are no means within the building of excluding the water from the standpipe, and it appears to be inconsistent with its purpose that the water should be turned off. The standpipe enters the building through the area, passing through the foundation, whence it is carried backward and upward by steps or sets off, and rises through the plaintiff's office on the ground floor, through the first floor, near the middle, in that part of it which was occupied by the plaintiff, through the second floor, and to the third floor. There was connected with this pipe, on the first floor, and also on each of the other floors, a hose attachment.\nOn the afternoon of Saturday, 27th December, when the plaintiff's premises were closed, \"the T. to which was attached the fire hose pipe burst and let the water over the stock in the warehouse.\" And, when the plaintiff's manager went to the place on the afternoon of the following day, he found the first and ground floors flooded and the stock damaged by the water.\nThe plaintiff seeks to recover these damages, alleging that the defendant, having vacated the building in November, 1924,\nnegligently failed to heat the premises thereafter, whereby the water in the standpipe froze, and the said standpipe, controlled by the defendant, burst, and flooded the plaintiff's premises, and damaged its stock of goods, wares and merchandise, on or about the 27th day of December, 1924.\nThe particulars of the negligence are alleged as failure to turn off the water and drain the standpipe during the period of excessive cold; failure to keep the water in the standpipe circulating, and allowing it to freeze and burst; failure to protect the standpipe by suitable covering to pre- vent frost, and failure to heat the building, so as to keep the water in the standpipe from freezing. It is moreover alleged, in the 8th paragraph of the statement of claim, that:\nThe said standpipe and the valve for turning off the water supply thereto and controlling the same were at the times aforesaid always under the control and management of the defendants and their servants and the plaintiff had no control thereof whatsoever.\nThere is however no proof of this paragraph in so far as it is intended to allege that the defendant had control of the valve in the area under the sidewalk, or at the junction with the city main, and no means were provided for turning off the water elsewhere.\nThe learned trial judge found for the plaintiff, and directed the damages to be assessed, for the reason as he states, referring to the defendant company, that:\nIt was their duty to take reasonable care that the premises and its amenities retained in their occupation and possession were not in such a condition as to cause damage to the parts demised.\nHe said that the defendant had not succeeded in negativing negligence, and that the proximate cause of the damage was the water from the pipe, which was under the control of the defendant, and which had been allowed to burst as a result of the frost. The Court of Appeal unanimously reversed this judgment, and dismissed the action, although Galliher J.A., expressed some doubts. Upon the appeal to this Court it was argued for the appellant that the defendant company, notwithstanding its sub-lease to the plaintiff, retained the possession and control of the standpipe, because the demised premises were, by the description, confined to floor space, and therefore did not include the walls, partitions, pillars, and pipes enclosing, standing upon or passing through the floors which were demised; and it was contended therefore that the defendant became liable under the law as expounded in such cases as Hargroves v. Hartopp [2]; Dunster v. Hollis [3]; and Cockburn v. Smith [4], in which it was held that, in the circumstances, it was the duty of a landlord to exercise care to prevent damage to his tenant. It was also urged that the learned judges of the Court of Appeal erred in so far as their expressed view of the facts differed from that of the learned trial judge, but, in my judgment of the case, the liability is not affected by these differences and their solution becomes unnecessary. The material facts are not in question.\nIn the cases upon which the appellant relies the damage suffered was due to the neglect of the landlord to take care that damage was not caused to the tenant through the landlord's failure to maintain in safe condition, or his misuse of, those portions of the building comprising the demised premises which were retained in his possession and control. In Hargroves v. Hartopp[5], a case which is said to have received the approval of the House of Lords in Fairman v. Perpetual Investment Building Society [6], the landlord had retained possession of the roof, but he allowed the gutter to become stopped up, and neglected to clear it after notice, and, by reason of the stoppage, the rain-water found its way into the tenant's premises. It was held that the landlord was under a duty to take care that the water collected by the gutter did not cause damage to the tenant. In Dunster v. Hollis [7], there was a common stairway controlled by the landlord which, through his neglect, was unsafe. Cockburn v. Smith[8] , is another case of damage by water collected on the roof which remained in the landlord's possession and control. In the present case there is no evidence that in fact the landlord had the possession of, or exercised any control over, those portions of the standpipe which were within the demised premises, and the damage was caused by the bursting of the pipe in a part of the premises which was demised. The argument upon which the case is principally founded, that the standpipe was not included in the description of the lease, is not, I think, worthy of serious consideration. That part of the first floor, where the break occurred, was leased and occupied by the plaintiff for storage purposes. The standpipe was there, with hose connected, for fire protection. The lessee covenanted to repair, and that the lessor might enter and view the state of repair, and the lessor covenanted for quiet enjoyment. And when, in the description contained in the lease, the demised premises were described as floor spaces of defined areas within walls and partitions, it is impossible, I think, reasonably to suggest that these spaces did not contemplate extent in three dimensions, or did not include space upward from floor to ceiling, including the walls, partitions and fixtures within. Space in a newspaper means one thing; space in a warehouse means another. The word should be interpreted having regard to the obvious use for which the space is required, and, in the latter case, it includes \"room.\" It is a rule of the common law that, in the absence of covenants providing otherwise, a tenant who takes a floor in a house must be held to take the premises as they are and cannot complain that the landlord does not repair, or that the house was not constructed differently. Pomfret v. Ricroft [9]; Carstairs v. Taylor [10]. A landlord is not liable for the consequence of letting a house which is out of repair, even if the state of disrepair be dangerous, and I think it must follow that he is not liable, unless by stipulation, for damages caused to the tenant by frost or its consequences. It is reasonable that this should be so. No means had been provided by the landlord for the heating of the room in which the break in the pipe occurred. It appears that the building had been in use for many years, and it was not known that the standpipe had previously been frozen, but when the temperature fell below the freezing point, and especially when it went to 8 degrees, the tenant must have known as well as the landlord that there was risk of the pipe freezing, and being in possession, had the means to prevent it, or to avoid the consequences.\nIt was pointed out by Scrutton L.J. in Cockburn v. Smith [11], that\nthere are exceptions which modify the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher [12], and reduce the duty of insuring against damage to an obligation to take reasonable care that damage does not occur. One of these exceptions is where the premises on which the artificial construction is erected and the premises damaged by the escape of water are in one house and the construction is erected for the use of both premises. In this case the occupier of the latter premises takes the ordinary risks of damage from escaping water. *** In my view his [the landlord's] duty may be base that modified doctrine of Rylands v. Fletcher (1) which is applicable where he retains in his control an artificial construction which becomes a source of danger to his tenant.\nSee also Anderson v. Oppenheimer (2). But, in the present case, I see no room for application of the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher (1). either in its general effect or subject to any of its modifications. Indeed I do not perceive any principle upon which the landlord is answerable. The fact that the radiator in the plaintiff's office, on the ground floor, was supplied with heat from the small furnace which the defendant operated in the basement does not, in my judgment, justify an implication that the defendant undertook to keep the room occupied by the plaintiff on the first floor free from frost, or its consequences.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014While fully concurring in the opinion of my brother Newcombe, I should be prepared to dismiss this appeal on the ground taken by the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal and Mr. Justice M. A. Macdonald.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wherry, Zimmerman & Osborne.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Mayers, Lane & Thomson.\n[1] [1926] 3 W.W.R. 129.\n[2] [1905] 1 K.B. 472.\n[3] [1918] 2 K.B. 795.\n[4] [1924] 2 K.B. 119.\n[5] [1905] 1 K.B. 472.\n[6] [1923] A.C. 74.\n[7] [1918] 2 K.B. 795.\n[8] [1924] 2 K.B. 119.\n[9] [1669] 1 Saunders 321.\n[10] (1871) L.R. 6 Ex. 217, at p. 222.\n[11] [1924] 2 K.B. 119, at pp. 132,133.\n[12] (1869) L.R. 3 H.L. 330.\n",

A steel cable snapped, and a broken end coiled around a steel guy line, the friction causing sparks which ignited the bark of a tree, starting a fire. Defendant had all the appliances required by law for fighting fires, and its men did all they could to extinguish the flames, but the fire spread and damaged plaintiffs' property. Plaintiffs claimed damages.\nHeld, plaintiffs could not recover; as to the complaint that defendant should have used a \"tree jack\" in its system of operations, it could not be said, on the evidence, that defendant's method of operation was defective; and, although the season was drier than usual, it could not be said that operating at all at the time was per se negligence; the fire was a pure accident (Municipality of Port Coquitlam v. Wilson, [1923] S.C.R. 235, referred to).\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia (37 B.C. Rep. 525) affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[1] reversing the judgment of Morrison J. who held the plaintiffs entitled to recover against the defendants for damages to their property through a fire which started from sparks caused by the friction of a broken end of a steel cable striking another steel cable, in the course of defendant's logging operations. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nE. Lafleur K.C. and F. Higgins K.C. for the appellant.\nR. S. Robertson K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014This appeal raises the question whether the respondent is liable for the damage caused by a fire which started in the place where it was carrying on its logging operations and spread to the property of the appellant Higgins, which was leased to the appellant Chan Sing. The learned trial judge found the respondent liable, and appointed a referee to assess the damages. This referee made his report, in accordance with which judgment issued awarding $1,132.50 to the appellant Higgins and $394 to the appelant Chan Sing. From this judgment an appeal was taken by the respondent. The appellants also cross-appealed against the assessment of their damages, alleging that the referee, before making his report, had improperly visited the property in the absence of the parties and of their counsel. The main appeal was allowed by the Court of Appeal, Macdonald C.J.A., and McPhillips J.A. dissenting. The dissenting judges would also have maintained the cross-appeal of the appellants. The latter now appeal to this court, asking that the decision of the appellate court be set aside and that their cross-appeal be allowed. In the view I take of the question at issue, it will not be necessary to deal with the cross-appeal.\nThe material facts of the case may be briefly stated.\nIn the summer of 1925, the respondent was carrying on logging operations in the Comox District, Vancouver Island, using what is known as the Lidgerwood system for lifting the logs and carrying them through the air to its railway siding. In this system, there is what is called the sky line, a steel cable connecting at a height of about 75 feet two trees, one known as the head spar tree, near the siding, and the other, the tail spar tree, which was at a distance of 1,100 feet from the former. Suspended to the air line there was a movable appliance called the bicycle, from which another cable hung, on to which the logs were hooked in order to be carried down the line to the siding and there loaded on the respondent's cars.\nThe sky line was a new steel cable, one inch and a half in diameter, in use only for about three weeks. It was daily inspected, and usually would not be used more than a few hours on the same trees. Where it reached the tail spar tree it was looped or wrapped around the tree, and held in place by spikes, and it then continued towards the ground a distance of 175 to 200 feet, where it was firmly anchored to a tree stump. The tail spar tree was also protected as far as possible from oscillation by two steel guy lines on either side of the descending portion of the sky line.\nThe summer of 1925 was drier than usual. On August 8, the day the fire started, the degree of humidity was 47, but we are without information as to the temperature. About half\u2014past nine in the forenoon, what I have called the descending portion of the sky line suddenly snapped about 20 feet from the tail spar tree, and one of the broken ends of the steel cable coiled around one of the guy lines, the friction causing sparks which ignited the bark of a tree, and pieces of the burning bark fell from the tree and set fire to some cedar brush. The respondent had all the appliances required by the forestry laws of the province for fighting fires, but although its men immediately set to work to extinguish the flames and did all they could, the fire spread and eventually reached the appellant's property some miles distant and caused the damage for which this action was brought.\nThe sole point with which we are concerned is whether the respondent is liable towards the appellants for the damages which they claim. The legal principles governing liability in such a case were fully explained in the decision of this court in The Municipality of Port Coquitlam v. Wilson[2], where all the relevant authorities were referred to. If, applying these principles to the case under consideration, it can be said that the fire in question \"accidentally began,\" no liability was incurred by the respondent.\nIt was contended by the appellants at the trial that the respondent should have used what is called a tree jack on the tail spar tree through which the sky line would have passed. The evidence however was contradictory as to the usefulness of such an appliance, the respondent's experts stating that, unless it were possible to find a tail stump or anchor directly in line with the spar trees, the cable would scrape against the shell of the jack and would be cut. In their opinion, looping or wrapping the air line cable around the tail spar tree is the only practicable method of operation. The respondent had tree jacks but after trying them had discontinued their use.\nThe learned trial judge purposely did not deal with the respective merits of these two methods, being in doubt whether he was in position to say that one was better than the other. On the other hand, the dissenting judges in the Court of Appeal considered that the method of wrapping the steel air line around the tail spar tree instead of using a tree jack was a defective method, and that the defect was calculated to break the cable and start the fire.\nAfter having carefully read all the testimony, I am, with great respect, unable on the evidence to say that the re- spondent's method of operation was defective. The reason given by practical loggers for discarding the tree jack\u2014the difficulty of finding a tail stump or anchor directly in line with the spar trees\u2014seems plausible. There is no evidence that at the place here in question there was available a convenient tail stump or anchor in line with the spar trees, and I am not in position to find, against the opinion of the majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal, and in the absence of a finding by the learned trial judge, that the respondent was negligent in not using the tree jack in this instance.\nI have therefore only to consider whether the respondent was guilty of negligence importing liability for the sole reason that it carried on its operations in a season drier than usual, when, if by such an accident as occurred a fire was ignited, it might spread and cause damage. In the opinion of the learned trial judge, there was a breach of the duty of the respondent to take due care in the circumstances \"by operating at that time of the year with an appliance of that sort.\"\nSo far as the experience of the practical loggers called at the trial went, they had never heard of a fire caused by the snapping of a steel cable and its coming in contact with another cable. It is true that it is a well known fact that sparks are caused by the striking of one piece of steel against another or against a stone. But no one had ever heard of a fire being occasioned by the snapping of the sky line of a logging machine such as that used by the respondent. I may refer to the evidence given by one of the appellants' witnesses, whose testimony impressed the learned trial judge, Allen Brady. He is asked in cross-examination:\u2014\nQ. Now did you ever see this kind of accident happen before?\nA. I never seen anything like that happen before, not like that.\nSo far therefore as this unfortunate occurrence might have been anticipated by a practical logger, the testimony is entirely in favour of the respondent.\nAs Mr. Justice Galliher observes:\nLumbering is one of the chief industries of British Columbia, and the felling and logging of timber is one of the elements of that industry. This operation is necessarily of a more or less dangerous character, and that danger is accentuated at certain seasons of the year by conditions of humidity, in various stages, such as partly prevailed at the time in question here.\nBut the legislature has not seen fit to establish a close season for such operations. The regulations made under the forestry laws of the province require logging concerns to have on hand certain appliances for fighting fires, and these requirements were complied with by the respondent, as Major Cowan, District Forester of Vancouver Island District, testifies. He says that the fire fighting equipment of the respondent was always more than up to the general standard. It is stated that the respondent received warnings from the forestry authorities, but these warnings, which were not filed at the trial, appear to have been merely a request to be careful, and the respondent was careful.\nIn my opinion, it is impossible to say that operating at all at the time was per se negligence. I am therefore impelled to the conclusion that liability was not incurred by the respondent solely by carrying on its operations under the circumstances that prevailed. I think the fire was a pure accident.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Frank Higgins.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Farris, Farris, Stulz & Sloan.\n[1] 37 B.C.

Fisher K.C. for the province of Saskatchewan.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014By order of the Governor General in Council of 24th June, 1926, the following question was referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration, pursuant to s. 60 of the Supreme Court Act:\nIs Section 17 of the Alberta Act, in whole or in part, ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada, and, if so, in what particular or particulars?\nThe reasons for the reference are thus stated in the order:\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 24th June, 1926, from the Minister of Justice, stating that as the result of certain negotiations looking to the transfer to the province of Alberta of the public lands within that province, now vested in the Crown and administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada, an agreement was entered into on the 9th January, 1926, between the governments of the Dominion of Canada and of the province of Alberta, respectively, whereby it was agreed that certain provisions of the Alberta Act should be modified to the intent that all Crown lands, mines, minerals and royalties within the province, and sums due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals or royalties should, from and after the coming into force of the said agreement, belong to the province, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof and to the several other terms and conditions particularly set forth in said agreement. Subsequently, the two governments agreed upon certain additional provisions to be inserted in the said agreement relative to the transfer and administration of the School Lands Fund and certain specified school lands, to parks and forest reserves affected by the agreement, and to the rights and properties of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company. Notice was given by a resolution that a bill would be introduced into Parliament, at its present session, to approve and give effect to the said agreement as so modified, but a question having been raised as to the constitutional validity of section 17 of the Alberta Act, relative to the subject of education and schools within the said province, it was decided not to proceed with the proposed legislation as drafted until this question of doubt could be authoritatively settled.\nIn accordance with the directions which were subsequently given, pursuant to the rules, the Attorney General of Saskatchewan and the Attorney General of Alberta received notice of the hearing, but neither of them filed a factum, although it was expressly directed that each might do so, and each of them announced his intention to appear, but not to take part in the argument. The Attorney General of Canada, represented by counsel, filed a factum maintaining the enacting authority of Parliament, and the Court, in the exercise of its discretion under subsec. 5 of section 6.0, requested Mr. Chrysler, K.C., to argue the case in opposition to the view submitted by the Attorney General of Canada, and the hearing was postponed to afford adequate time for preparation. The difficulties in the way of the opposition were very great, as will presently appear, but it is needless to say that any interest, whatever it may be, which is concerned to have s. 17 of the Alberta Act pronounced invalid, can have no cause to complain that Mr. Chrysler did not exhaust the legitimate resources of advocacy in support of his case.\nThe province of Alberta was carved out of that part of the Dominion which was described in s. 146 of the British North America Act, 1867, as Rupert\u2019s Land and the Northwestern Territory. By this section it was lawful for the Queen in Council, upon address from the Houses of Parliament of Canada, to admit Rupert\u2019s Land and the Northwestern Territory, or either of them, into the Union, on such terms and conditions as were in the address expressed and as the Queen thought fit to approve, \u201csubject to the provisions of this Act\u201d; and it was declared that the provisions of any Order in Council in that behalf should have effect as if they had been enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The manner in which this power was exercised, and the subsequent acts and proceedings leading up to the constitution of the new prairie provinces, may be briefly mentioned.\nBy the effect of the Rupert\u2019s Land Act, 1868, 31-32 Vic., c. 105; the surrender of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Co. of 19th July, 1869, and the Order of the Queen in Council of 23rd July, 1870, Rupert\u2019s Land and the Northwestern Territory, which I shall hereinafter call the Territories, were admitted into and became part of the Dominion, and it was declared that the Parliament of Canada should have authority to legislate for the peace, order and good government, or the future welfare and good government, thereof. Temporary provision for the government of the Territories was made by Act of the Dominion, c. 3 of 1869; the province of Manitoba was constituted by the Manitoba Act, 1870, 33 Vic., c. 3, and these Acts were confirmed by the British North America Act, 1871, 34-35 Vic., c. 28. By the latter Act, upon the recital that doubts had been entertained respecting the powers of the Parliament of Canada to establish provinces in Territories admitted, or which might thereafter be admitted, into the Dominion, and that it was expedient to remove such doubts and to vest such powers, it was enacted, by s. 2, that the Parliament of Canada might, from time to time, establish new provinces in any territories forming, for the time being, part of the Dominion, but not included in any province, and might\nat the time of such establishment, make provision for the constitution and administration of any such province, and for the passing of laws for the peace, order and good government of such province, and for its representation in the said Parliament.\nIt was also enacted, by s. 4, that\nthe Parliament of Canada may, from time to time, make provision for the administration, peace, order and good government of any territory not, for the time being, included in any province.\nBy the two remaining sections, 5 and 6, the Act for the temporary government of Rupert\u2019s Land and the Northwestern Territory, and the Manitoba Act, 1870, were confirmed, and it was declared that it should not be competent to the Parliament of Canada to alter the provisions of the last mentioned Act \u201cor of any other Act hereafter establishing new provinces in the said Dominion.\" Subsequently, by Order of Her Majesty in Council of 31st July, 1880, it was comprehensively ordered and declared that:\nFrom and after the first day of September, 1880, all British Terri\u00adtories and Possessions in North America, not already included within the Dominion of Canada, and all Islands adjacent to any of such Terri\u00adtories or Possessions, shall (with the exception of the Colony of New\u00adfoundland and its dependencies) become and be annexed to and form part of the said Dominion of Canada; and become and be subject to the laws for the time being in force in the said Dominion, in so far as such laws may be applicable thereto.\nBy the British North America Act, 1886, entitled \" An Act respecting the representation in the Parliament of Canada of Territories which for the time being form part of the Dominion of Canada, but are not included in any pro\u00advince,\" it is recited that it is expedient to empower the Parliament of Canada to provide for the representation in the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, or either of them, of any territory which for the time being forms part of the Dominion of Canada, but is not included in any province, and it is provided that the Parliament` of Canada may make provision for such representation; it is also provided that any Act theretofore passed by the Par\u00adliament for the purpose mentioned shall, if not disallowed, be deemed to have been valid and effectual from the date when it received the assent, and, subjoined to this pro\u00advision, which is to be found in s. 2, is the following declaration:\nIt is hereby declared that any Act passed by the Parliament of Can\u00adada, whether before or after the passing of this Act, for the purpose mentioned in this Act or in the British North America Act, 1871, has effect, notwithstanding anything in the British North America Act, 1867, and the number of Senators or the number of Members of the House of Commons specified in the last mentioned Act is increased by the number of Senators or of Members, as the case may be, provided by any such Act of the Parliament of Canada for the representation of any pro\u00advinces or territories of Canada.\nThere is also the concluding provision which was relied upon as declaratory of the unity of the several Acts. It provides that:\nThis Act and the British North America Act, 1867, and the British North America Act, 1871, shall be construed together, and may- be cited together as the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1886.\nIt was in pursuance of the powers thus conferred and existing that the Parliament of Canada, on 20th July, 1905, enacted the Alberta Act, to come into force on 1st September of that year. It recites the provisions of the British North America Act, 1871, and that it is expedient to establish as a province the territory therein described, and to make provision for the government thereof, and the representation thereof in the Parliament of Canada. The territory described was wholly comprised within the Northwestern Territory or Rupert's Land, which, down to the time of the constitution of the new province, had been governed under the provisions of the North West. Terri\u00adtories Acts, enacted by the Parliament of Canada pursuant to the powers derived from the British North America Act, 1871. The authority of the Parliament to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the territory which became the province of Alberta, so long as it re\u00admained a part of the Territories, and to provide that it should be constituted into a province, is thus incontestable, and it was not contested. But it was said that the Parliament could not vary, for the new province of Alberta, s. 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, which defines the provincial legislative powers relating to education in each of the original provinces. It was sought to introduce a limitation into, the ample and comprehensive powers declared by, the British North America Act, 1871, depending, as I understood the argument, not upon the fact that the enactment is designed to regulate education, but upon a general exception, which, it was said, is to be found in the words of s. 146 of the British North America Act, 1867, \"subject to the provisions of this Act,\" and that these words must, by implication, be read into s. 2 of the Act of 1871; it was argued that these words must be impliedly incorporated, because s. 146 provides for the admission into the Union, not only of the colonies of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island and British Columbia, .but also of Rupert's Land and the Northwestern Territory, or either of them, \" on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the addresses expressed and as the Queen thinks fit to approve, subject to the provisions of this Act.\" It was ingeniously urged that the provisions referred to were all those which were, in the British North America Act, 1867, common to the original provinces, and that the Territories thus became constitutionally incapable of incorporation into the Union as provinces upon terms or conditions in anywise different from those which applied equally to Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. This contention, if maintainable, might have constituted a very serious impediment, if not an insurmountable obstacle, to the framing of satisfactory constitutions, but it does not appear to have occurred to anybody before the hearing of this case, and the argument does not rest upon any sound foundation, as I think the following considerations will show.\nThe provisions of s. 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, are well known, and they have frequently been the subject of judicial interpretation. The section provides that\nin and for each province the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to education, subject and according to the following provisions.\nThese provisions are set out in four enumerations, the first of which is that:\nNothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons have by law in the Province at the Union.\nThe second enumeration is designed to ensure equality in relation to separate schools as between Ontario and Quebec, and the other two enumerations contain special provisions for the working out of the general principle enunciated by the first:\nBy s. 17 of the Alberta Act it is provided as follows:\nSection 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, shall apply to the said province, with the substitution for paragraph (1) of the said section 93, of the following paragraph:\u2014\n\u201c1. Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to separate schools which any class of persons have at the date of the passing of this Act, under the terms of chapters 29 and 30 of the Ordinances of the North-West Territories, passed in the year 1901, or with respect to religious instruction in any public or separate school as provided for in the said ordinances.\u201d\n2. In the appropriation by the Legislature or distribution by the Government of the province of any moneys for the support of schools organized and carried on in accordance with the said chapter 29 or any Act passed in amendment thereof, or in substitution therefor, there shall be no discrimination against schools of any class described in the said chapter 29.\n3. Where the expression \u201cby law\u201d is employed in paragraph 3 of the said section 93, it shall be held to mean the law as set out in the said chapters 29 and 30, and where the expression \u201cat the Union\u201d is employed, in the said paragraph 3, it shall be held to mean the date at which this Act comes into force.\nIt was enacted by s. 3 of the Alberta Act that:\nThe provisions of The British North America Acts, 1867 to 1886, shall apply to the province of Alberta in the same way and to the like extent as they apply to the provinces heretofore comprised in the Dominion, as if the said province of Alberta had been one of the provinces originally united, except in so far as varied by this Act and except such provisions as are in terms made, or by reasonable intendment, may be held to be specially applicable to or only to affect one or more and not the whole of the said provinces.\nThere is a corresponding provision in the Manitoba Act, 1870, s. 2, and in the terms of Union with British Columbia, clause 10; also in the terms of Union with Prince Edward Island, the penultimate clause. In each case the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867, were to apply, except so far as varied by the terms of Union, and it was thus, in these particular cases, found not incompatible with admission into the Union with provincial status that the terms of Union should have the right of way. But, so far as the Territories are concerned, the powers conferred by s. 146 were exhausted or spent by their admission into the Union under the Order in Council of 23rd July, 1870; I cannot discover that any terms were introduced which conflict with the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867, and nobody doubts, and it is not denied, that the Territories were lawfully admitted. Consequently, it is not necessary for present purposes to interpret the general meaning or effect of the words \u201csubject to the provisions of this Act,\u201d as found in s. 146. The Territories were admitted in the execution of competent powers under the provisions of the Act of 1867 and the Rupert\u2019s Land Act, 1868, and the legislative powers of the Parliament of Canada with regard to them were declared in the most comprehensive terms by the Act of 1871. Parliament, it is declared, may make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territories. These words, as said by Lord Halsbury in Riel v. The Queen[1], are\napt to authorize the utmost discretion of enactment for the attainment of the objects pointed to. They are words under which the widest departure from criminal procedure as it is known and practised in this country have been authorized in Her Majesty\u2019s Indian Empire. Forms of procedure unknown to the English common law have there been established and acted upon, and to throw the least doubt upon the validity of powers conveyed by those words would be of widely mischievous consequence.\nThey are the common words which are used in the execution of the powers of the Crown or of Parliament for the constitution of Colonial Governments.\nChapters 29 and 30 of the Ordinances of the North-west Territories, 1901, which are mentioned in s. 17 of the Alberta Act, are the School Ordinance and the School Assessment Ordinance which were in force at the time of the constitution of the province, and which regulated the matter of education and taxation for school purposes, under the authority of the then existing legislation of Canada, comprised in the Northwest Territories Act and its amendments. The Territories had, from the time of their admission into the Union, exercised, under legislative grant from the Dominion, powers of self-government which had gradually been expanded, until, when the Ordinances of 1901 were passed, they had for many years enjoyed a representative assembly, with powers of legislation not far inferior to those of the provincial Legislatures. See the North-west Territories Act, as enacted in c. 50 of R.S.C., 1886, as amended, particularly c. 19 of 1888, and c 22 of 1891, of the Dominion. It is useless, in view of the governing cases, to suggest any doubt as to the authority of Parliament to confer these legislative powers. The Queen v. Burah[2]; Hodge v. The Queen[3]; Liquidators of The Maritime Bank of Canada v. Receiver-General of New Brunswick[4]. These authorities make it clear that the Parliament of Canada had plenary powers of legislation as large and of the same nature as those of the Parliament of the United Kingdom itself; and, thus construed, so long as there was no repugnancy to an Imperial Statute, there was no limit, operating within the Territories, to the legislative power which the Dominion might exercise for their administration, peace, order and good government, while they continued to be. Territories, or, at the time of the establishment of new provinces therein, for the constitution and administration of any such province, and for the passing of laws for the peace, order and good government thereof, and for its representation in the Parliament of Canada.\nIt was to perpetuate under the Union the rights and privileges with respect to separate schools, or with respect to religious instruction in the public or separate schools, and to avoid discrimination in the appropriation and distribution of the legislative grants for education, as provided for in the North-west Territories Acts of the Dominion, and in the Territorial Ordinances of 1901, that s. 17 of the Alberta Act was enacted, and it would be strange indeed if, when the new provinces emerged, constitutional guarantees could not be afforded by a law-making body which had the powers of the Imperial Parliament to legislate for their constitution and administration, and to define their powers to pass laws for their peace, order and good government. The Ordinances, as I have shown, derived their force mediately from the Parliament of Canada, which had conferred the territorial legislative powers under which they were directly enacted. It is unquestionable that they had the force of law in the Territories from the time of their enactment down to the constitution of the province of Alberta in 1905, and it seems to be as plain as words can tell that, at the time of the establishment of the province of Alberta, the Parliament of Canada had the power to define and to regulate the legislative powers which were to be possessed by the new province. It is, I think, as impossible as it is inexpedient to cast any doubt upon the generality and comprehensive nature of constitutional powers conferred for peace, order and good government, and I do not find, either in the British North America Act of 1867 or of 1871, anything expressed or implied which limited the power of the Parliament of Canada in 1905 to define the constitution and powers of the provinces which were at that time established and constituted within the Territories.\nOf course, if the second paragraph of s. 2 of the British North America Act, 1886, be intended to have general application, the case is relieved of any possibility of a suggestion or accent of doubt, because it is there declared that\nany Act passed by the Parliament of Canada, whether before or after the passing of this Act, for the purpose mentioned in this Act, or in the British North America Act, 1871, has effect notwithstanding anything in the British North America Act, 1867.\nBut, in the view which I take, it is not necessary to consider the application of this provision, which, it may be suggested, is limited, having regard to the title of the Act, and its purpose as set forth in the recital, and the concluding sentence of the paragraph to which I have referred, which makes provision for representation in the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, a subject which, it may be observed, is also expressly included in s. 2 of the British North America Act, 1871.\nFor the above reasons my answer to the question submitted is that s. 17 of the Alberta Act is not, in whole or in part, ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nQuestion referred answered accordingly.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General of Canada: W.

(R.S.O., 1914, c. 135).\nA trading company (formed under the Dominion Companies Act), to secure payment of its bonds, by a \u201ctrust deed\u201d purported to \u201csell, assign, transfer, hypothecate, mortgage, pledge and set over and charge\u201d unto a trustee, certain land, and all its movable assets for the time being, both present and future, in the province of Ontario, subject to the proviso that the \u201cfloating charge\u201d created should not prevent the company, until the security should become enforceable and the trustee should have demanded or become bound to enforce it, dealing with the subject matter of the \u201cfloating charge\u201d in the ordinary course of its business and for the purpose of carrying on the same. The instrument was registered in the land registry office, and was filed with the Secretary of State as required by the Dominion Companies Act, but was not registered under the Ontario Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act (R.S.O., 1914, c. 135), and, for want of such registration, was attacked on behalf of the company\u2019s creditors.\nHeld (Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret J. dissenting) that the instrument was a \u201cmortgage\u201d within the meaning of the said Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act, and required registration under it.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Ont. (59 Ont. L.R. 293) reversed on this point.\nThe nature and effect of a \u201cfloating charge\u201d discussed, with references to authorities.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret J. (dissenting): If the Act had been originally enacted in its present form and terms, a floating charge might be deemed to fall within its operation, as being within the mischief it was designed to meet; but, according the proper consideration to the history and development of the statute, a floating charge (within which term the instrument came) cannot be said to be a \u201cmortgage\u201d or a \u201cconveyance intended to operate as a mortgage\u201d within the meaning of the Act. History of the legislation reviewed, with references to cases; Johnston v. Wade (17 Ont. L.R. 372) explained and discussed.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] in so far as it varied the judgment of Fisher J.[2] by holding that the instrument in question did not require registration under the Ontario Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act.\nThe defendant J.A. Larocque Limited was incorporated under the Dominion Companies Act (R.S.C., 1906, c. 79), and carried on the business of retail merchants at the city of Ottawa, Ontario. The company decided to borrow money for its corporate purposes by the issue of bonds, and to secure payment thereof it gave a \u201ctrust deed\u201d to the defendant the Capital Trust Corporation Limited (therein called \u201cThe Trustee\u201d), dated 17th September, 1923. The instrument read in part as follows:\nNow therefore this indenture witnesseth that in order to secure the payment of the principal and interest of all the said bonds at any time issued and outstanding hereunder, according to their tenor, the company, in consideration of the premises and of the purchase and acceptance of such bonds by the holders thereof, and in consideration of the sum of $1 to it paid by the Trustee, receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, has sold, assigned, transferred, hypothecated, mortgaged, pledged and set over, and by these presents doth sell, assign, transfer, hypothecate, mortgage, pledge and set over and charge unto the Trustee, its successors and assigns, forever:\n1. All that certain parcel or tract of land and premises [particularly described].\n2. All its movable assets for the time being, both present and future, of whatsoever kind and where so ever situate, in the province of Ontario, hereinafter referred to as the \u201cfloating charged property\u201d and including its undertaking and its other property and assets, real, personal or mixed, present and future, not hereinbefore assured, together with all its present and future tolls, rents, revenues, incomes and sources of income, goodwill, chattels, stock-in-trade, plant, furniture, books of account, moneys, credits, things in action, contracts, agreements, bills, notes, negotiable and non-negotiable instruments, judgments, securities, rights, powers, patents, trade-marks, copyrights, privileges and franchises, and all of the property and things of value of every kind and nature which the company may be or hereafter shall become possessed of or entitled to, providing that the \u201cfloating charge,\u201d created by this paragraph shall in no way hinder or prevent the company until the security hereby constituted shall become enforceable and the Trustee shall have demanded or become bound to enforce the same, either by dividends out of profits, leasing, mortgaging, pledging, selling, alienating or otherwise disposing of or dealing with the subject matters of such \u201cfloating charge\u201d in the ordinary course of its business and for the purpose of carrying on the same.\nThe instrument was registered in the land registry office, and was filed with the Secretary of State as required by the Dominion Companies Act (R.S.C., 1906, c. 79, as amended by 4 & 5 Geo. V, c. 23, s. 3, and 7 & 8 Geo. V, c. 25, s. 9), but was not registered pursuant to the Ontario Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act (R.S.O., 1914, c. 135), nor pursuant to the Ontario Assignment of Book Debts Act, 1923, (c. 29).\nDefault was made by the debtor company, and on 9th June, 1925, under the provisions of the said instrument, the defendant the Capital Trust Corporation Limited, the trustee, appointed a receiver who took possession of the debtor company\u2019s property and carried on its business.\nOn 6th August, 1925, the plaintiff Gordon Mackay & Company Limited, commenced this action on behalf of itself and all other creditors of the debtor company, to set aside the trust deed for want of registration, both as a chattel mortgage and as an assignment of the book debts.\nOn 21st August, 1925, the debtor company was, by order of the court, adjudged bankrupt, and the plaintiff Canadian Credit Men\u2019s Association Limited became trustee in bankruptcy, and, by order of 17th November, 1925, was added as a plaintiff in the action, and by the same order leave was granted to the plaintiffs to proceed with the action.\nThe trial judge, Fisher J., gave judgment in favour of the plaintiffs[3], declaring that, so far as the instrument purported to cover the goods and chattels and book debts, it was null and void as against the plaintiffs for want of registration.\nThe Appellate Division[4] varied the judgment of Fisher J. by declaring (Magee and Ferguson, JJ.A., dissenting) that the security created, in so far as it purported to cover the goods and chattels, was a valid floating charge or security, and was not required to be registered as a mortgage under the provisions of the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act. It declared (unanimously upholding the judgment of Fisher J. in this respect) that, in so far as it purported to cover the book debts, it was, as against the plaintiffs, null and void for want of registration under the Assignment of Book Debts Act, 1923.\nIn so far as the judgment of the Appellate Division varied the judgment of Fisher J., as above stated, the plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nThe question for decision by this Court was whether the instrument in question was a mortgage within the meaning of the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act, R.S.O., 1914, c. 135, and, for want of registration, was void as regards the chattel property. The defendant the Capital Trust Corporation Limited contended that, the effect of the instrument, as to the chattel property, being merely to create a \u201cfloating charge\u201d, it was not a mortgage within the meaning of that Act and did not require registration under it. G.H. Kilmer K.C., T.A. Beament K.C., and H.H. Davis for the appellant.\nF.H. Chrysler K.C. and P.H. Chrysler for the respondent.\nANGLIN C.J.C. (dissenting).\u2014If the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act (R.S.O., 1914, c. 135) had been originally enacted in the form and terms in which we now find it, and if the question on this appeal were res integra, it may be that, giving due effect to the rule of construction embodied in s. 10 of the Interpretation Act, (R.S.O., c. 1), a floating charge such as that now before us might be held to come within its purview. The unknown and unregistered floating charge is as formidable a menace to the confiding and unsuspecting creditor, purchaser or mortgagee as is the unregistered bill of sale or chattel mortgage not accompanied by delivery and actual and continued change of possession. Within the mischief which the statute was designed to meet, the floating charge might be deemed to fall within its operation as now framed, if it were a new Act.\nBut, in construing a statute of gradual growth, such as the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act in its present form, we cannot ignore its history and development without incurring grave risk of giving to it an effect which the legislature has not intended. MacMillan v. Dent[5]; Eastman Photographic Materials Co., Ltd. v. Comptroller-General of Patents[6]; Shaw v. Great Western Railway Company[7]. According the consideration to which they are entitled to the history and development of this statute, the majority of the Appellate Divisional Court (Mulock C.J.O., Hodgins and Smith JJ.A.), were, in my opinion, right in holding[8] that a floating charge is not a mortgage, or a conveyance intended to operate as a mortgage (s. 2 (c)), within the meaning of that Act.\nThe floating charge, its character and incidents, and the distinction between it and a chattel mortgage with licence to sell and substitute in the ordinary course of business, although that distinction is fine and sometimes elusive, are well-known to English law. Of this the cases cited in the judgments of Hodgins and Smith JJ.A., afford abundant illustration. With those learned judges, I am convinced that the instrument now under consideration was intended to be, and must be regarded as, a floating charge in the sense defined by the English authorities. It did not operate, when given, as a specific charge on any property of J.A. Larocque, Ltd.; it covered that company\u2019s entire undertaking as a floating charge in suspense until the situation arose and the acts were done upon which it was to become a specific mortgage, and thereupon it attached to and bound every portion of the personal property of the company comprised in its undertaking as it then subsisted. I do not dwell further upon this aspect of the case, because neither in this Court nor in the Appellate Divisional Court does there seem to be any serious difficulty in regard to it.\nThere can be no doubt that the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act, as originally enacted in 1849 (12 Vic., c. 74), as re-enacted in 1857 (20 Vic., c. 3), and as consolidated in 1859 (C.S., U.C., c. 45), in 1877, (R.S.O., c. 119), and in 1887, (R.S.O., c. 125), applied only to mortgages and sales of goods in esse and susceptible of immediate delivery by the mortgagor, and had no application to such securities as floating charges. The provisions of the first section of each of these statutes, requiring registration of mortgages of goods and chattels not accompanied by an immediate delivery and an actual and continued change of possession of the things mortgaged, puts this beyond controversy. That the application and scope of this legislation was thus restricted was the effect of many early Upper Canada and Ontario decisions. For instance, reference may be had to Harris v. Commercial Bank of Canada[9], where a conveyance, and to May v. Security Loan and Savings Co.[10], where a mortgage, in each case of goods in bond, were held not within the Act because the goods were not in the present possession and disposition of the mortgagor; to Burton v. Bellhouse[11], where a transfer of goods in course of manufacture was excluded from the operation of the Act; to Hamilton v. Harrison[12], where a mortgage upon growing crops was held not covered by the statute; and to Banks v. Robinson[13], where an agreement charging an interest in \u201cfuture-acquired property\u201d was likewise held not to require registration. All these decisions were based on the view that the statute applied only to conveyances or mortgages of goods and chattels in the actual possession of, and susceptible of present delivery by, the mortgagor or vendor. As put by Hagarty C.J., in May v. Security Loan and Savings\u2019 Co.[14]:\nIn the case of goods in a bonded warehouse we do not see how a registered bill of sale is necessary. They are not in the actual possession of the vendor.\nTherefore, until after 1887, it would seem clear that a floating charge intended to attach to all the personal property comprised in a company\u2019s undertaking, as it should then be, only upon the mortgagee\u2019s claim becoming exigible, was not within the purview of the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act.\nThe later amendments relied upon by the appellants to bring such a charge within the statute are now embodied in chapter 135 of the R.S.O., 1914, as sections 11, 16 and 24.\nIt was not until 1892 that the present s. 11, extending the application of the statute to mortgages and sales of \u201cfuture-acquired property,\u201d was enacted (55 Vic., c. 26, s. 1); (R.S.O.,1897, c. 148, s. 37). It deals with mortgages and sales of goods not the property of or in the possession of the mortgagor or bargainor; but its application is confined to \u201cmortgages and sales.\u201d There is nothing in it indicative of a legislative intent to embrace instruments intended not to operate as mortgages of specific existing or future-acquired property, but merely to have effect as floating charges. As an amendment intended to enlarge the scope of a statute operating in derogation of the common law, this provision may not be given a wider construction than its language imports merely because, in the opinion of the court, it would be in the public interest that its application should be so extended. Judicis est jus dicere, non dare. The terms of the amendment clearly indicate the intention that the requirement of registration shall apply to \u201cafter-acquired property,\u201d but only where the instrument affecting such property is a \u201cmortgage\u201d or a \u201csale.\u201d This section merely does away with the former restriction, of which it affords some legislative recognition, viz: that the operation of the statute had been theretofore confined to goods owned by or in the possession of the mortgagor at the time the mortgage was made.\nThe present section 16 was enacted in 1896 (59 Vic., c. 4, s. 1) (R.S.O., 1897, c. 148, s. 11). It has to do with contracts to give mortgages. It clearly contemplates agreements intended to be followed by instrumente which should be mortgages within the purview of the statute. It is difficult indeed to conceive that in enacting this provision the legislature had in view floating charges. To include them, terms entirely different would have been required. The obvious purpose of s. 24 of the R.S.O., 1914, first introduced in 1890 (53 Vic., c. 35, s. 1) and amended in 1897 (60 Vic., c. 14, s. 86), was to provide, in the case of company mortgages to secure debentures, a substitute for the affidavit of bona fides usually required from chattel mortgagees (s. 5 (b)), and for the renewal of such mortgages, the existing statutory provisions having been, in these respects, inapplicable to them. Again there is nothing whatever in the terms employed by the legislature indicative of an intent to extend the application of the statute to instruments intended to operate as floating charges as distinguished from mortgages, or to give to the word \u201cmortgage\u201d in the statute a new and extended meaning, such as that for which the appellant contends.\nWe are invited by the appellants to overrule the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Johnston v. Wade[15]. Mr. Justice Smith would seem[16] to have been of the opinion that a judgment in their favour would involve a reversal of that case.\nBut, as pointed out by Moss C.J.O.[17], the Court was dealing in Johnston v. Wade15 not with a covering instrument, such as that now before us, designed to secure debentures by a charge upon the issuing company\u2019s undertaking, but with a charge created by the debentures themselves which, says the learned Chief Justice, pass no property in the goods and chattels to the holder and confer upon him no right to take possession of them or to interfere with them in any way, except through the interposition of the Court.\nThe actual decision in Johnston v. Wade18 does not, therefore, conclude a case where the debentures are secured by a covering instrument such as a floating charge, which, upon the prescribed circumstances coming into existence, attaches as a specific mortgage to all the property then comprised in the mortgagor\u2019s undertaking, and may be enforced without curial intervention if it contain provisions apt to sanction that being done. Towards the close of his judgment in Johnston v. Wade[18], however, Moss C.J.O. said (p. 386):\nThe words of s. 1 of the Act 12 Vict., c. 74, are \u201cevery mortgage or conveyance intended to operate as a mortgage of goods and chattels.\u201d And the words of the Act 13 & 14 Vict., c. 62, are, \u201cevery sale of goods and chattels.\u201d These words have been carried without alteration through the 20 Vict., c. 3, the C.S.U.C., and various revisions, to the present R.S.O., 1897, c. 148, secs. 2 and 6. There is no other definition of chattel mortgages or bills of sale. The words \u201cmortgage or conveyance intended to operate as a mortgage of goods and chattels\u201d describe instruments of a well-known character.\nOsler J.A., added, at pp. 387-8:\nThe instruments to which the Act applies are such as directly affect the title to goods and chattels, either by immediate assignment or conveyance intended to operate as an assignment by way of mortgage to a mortgagee, and covenants, promises, and agreements to make, execute, or give such instruments. Section 23 of the Act shews how far the legislature intended to go in dealing with instruments for securing the bonds or debentures of a company. The only instruments of that class which are required to be registered are mortgages or conveyances of goods and chattels made to a bondholder or trustee for the purpose of securing the bonds or debentures of the company\u2014instruments, as I understand the section, of the same character as those mentioned in other sections of the Act, something quite different from the security by way of floating charge which the Companies Act enables the company to create by the bonds themselves.\nMeredith J.A. pointed out (p. 389) that the goods comprised in the company\u2019s undertaking, upon which its debentures may be secured (p. 391),\nmay be in different countries and removable from one county to another for the purposes of the company\u2019s business. The provisions of the Act and its requirements are so inapplicable as to render compliance with it impossible if these bonds were such mortgages. * * * The same legislative power which imposed the provisions of the Chattel Mortgage Act also conferred power to pledge the whole of the assets of the company to secure payment of the bonds in a manner quite inconsistent with an intention to require compliance with the provisions of that Act. * * * The Chattel Mortgage Act has, I think, always been held\u2014generally speaking\u2014to be inapplicable to cases in which it is impossible to comply with its requirements.\nThis judgment of the highest court of final resort in Ontario has been generally regarded as implying that a \u201cfloating charge\u201d given to secure debentures issued by a company is not a \u201cmortgage or conveyance intended to operate as a mortgage of goods and chattels\u201d within the purview of the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act, which, from its first enactment in 1849 (12 Vic., c. 74) has described in these words the instruments to which it was meant to apply. Since Johnston v. Wade19 was decided in 1908, many instruments similar in character to that now before us have been executed, and debentures running into many millions of dollars are probably secured to-day throughout Ontario by covering conveyances in the nature of floating charges which are invalid for want of registration if subject to the requirements of the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act.\nMoreover, the Ontario Companies Act (R.S.O., 1914, c. 178) (like that of the Dominion, [secs. 69 and 69A of the Companies Act, R.S.C., c. 79; 4 & 5 Geo. V, c. 23, s. 3; 7 & 8 Geo. V, c. 25, s. 9] which applies to the defendant company) contains the following provisions:\n82. (1) The directors may charge, hypothecate, mortgage, or pledge any or all of the real or personal property, including book debts and unpaid calls, rights, powers, undertaking and franchises of the corporation to secure any bonds, debentures, debenture stock, or other securities, or any liability of the corporation.\n(2) A duplicate original of such charge, mortgage, or other instrument of hypothecation or pledge made to secure such bonds, debentures, or debenture stock, or other securities, shall be forthwith filed in the office of the Provincial Secretary as well as registered under the provisions of any other Act in that behalf.\nThis section apparently contemplates that there may be charges which do not require registration under any other statute and makes provision for their publicity by enacting that duplicates thereof be filed forthwith in a government office.\nWith Meredith J.A. (Johnston v. Wade[19], at p. 391),\nif it is desirable that such a charge as that claimed in this case should be registered under the provisions of the Chattel Mortgage Act * * * it is, I think, the duty of the Court to wait until the legislature so enacts, not to anticipate such an enactment upon the more than doubtful language of the present enactments upon the subject.\nFor these reasons, as well as for those stated by Hodgins and Smith JJ.A., in the Appellate Divisional Court, the floating charge executed by the defendant company in favour of the respondent does not, in my opinion, fall within the purview of the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act.\nThe present appeal, therefore, fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal raises the question whether or not a certain instrument falls within the category of instruments dealt with by Chapter 135 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario for 1914, known as the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act. The immediate practical point is whether or not the requirements of the statute apply in such a way as to make registration of the instrument obligatory.\nThe instrument was executed on the 17th of September, 1923, by J.A. Larocque, Ltd., in favour of The Capital Trust Corporation, Ltd., described as the Trustee; and by it the company sold, assigned, transferred, hypothecated, mortgaged, pledged and set over as security for certain bonds of the company a certain parcel of real estate in the city of Ottawa and all its movable assets for the time being, both present and future, in the province of Ontario, subject to provisoes of redemption, and also subject to the condition that until the security should become enforceable, the company should not, by reason of the floating charge created by the instrument, be hindered or prevented dealing with any of its property in the ordinary course of its business and for the purpose of carrying on the same.\nThe question to be decided is whether an instrument of this character\u2014that is, an instrument intended to operate as a floating charge\u2014falls within the category of mortgages dealt with by the statute mentioned.\nI have not been able to satisfy myself that you cannot have a floating security by way of mortgage. Nobody doubts that you can have a mortgage of after acquired property: the statute, indeed, recognizes that itself. You can have, for example, a valid mortgage of chattels to be afterwards brought upon certain premises. As soon as the property is brought there and identified, the equitable right of the mortgagee attaches. That being so, I do not understand why you cannot have a mortgage of present and after acquired property to which the equitable rights of the mortgagee only attach specifically on the intervention of the mortgagee in the events upon which his right to intervene arises. In Tailby v. Official Receiver[20], Lord Macnaghten describes the nature of this class of security in these words:\nI pause for a moment to point out the nature and effect of the security created by the bill of sale of 1879. It belongs to a class of securities of which, perhaps, the most familiar example is to be found in the debentures of trading companies. It is a floating security, reaching over all the trade assets of the mortgagor for the time being, and intended to fasten upon and bind the assets in existence at the time when the mortgagee intervenes. In other words, the mortgagor makes himself trustee of his business for the purpose of the security. But the trust is to remain dormant until the mortgagee calls it into operation.\nThe instrument in question in that case seems to have been almost identical in terms with the instrument now before us; and throughout the judgment of Lord Macnaghten it is everywhere spoken of as a mortgage. And in truth the language of that judgment makes it quite clear that in the opinion of that great judge and master of equity, such a document as that before us might properly be described as an equitable mortgage.\nIt may, moreover, be observed that one of the recognized modes of creating an equitable mortgage is to create an equitable charge. That an instrument creating a floating security creates a present charge upon the property for the time being, falling within the description of property affected by it, is shewn by the fact that, notwithstanding the right of the mortgagor to deal with the property in the ordinary way of business, the charge takes priority over executions and judgments and over the rights of general creditors. There seems to be no reason to doubt the soundness of the statement in Palmer\u2019s Company Law, 11th Ed., p. 319:\nA floating charge operates as an immediate and continuing charge on the property charged, subject only to the company\u2019s powers to deal with the property in the ordinary course of its business.\nThen arises the question whether a security of this character, although properly described as a mortgage, does or does not fall within the operation of s. 11 of the statute. That section is very comprehensive in its terms; it extends to all mortgages, including equitable mortgages, of present and future goods, and there appears to be no good reason for affirming that it does not extend to a mortgage by an individual trader of all his present and future property, held in connection, for example, with a given business, or, indeed, without such restriction, in so far as that property may consist of goods and chattels. It seems impossible to restrict the section in such a way as to exclude an instrument which pledges other property as well as goods and chattels: one cannot suppose that either s. 5 or s. 11 could be evaded by the device of adding, for example, a charge upon book debts. Such an instrument would, on the principle of the judgment of Giffard L.J., in In Re Panama, New Zealand, and Australian Royal Mail Co.[21], be a floating security, because it would naturally imply that the trader was entitled to carry on his business; nor does there seem to be any sound reason for excluding from the operation of s. 11 a mortgage of such a character containing an express provision that, subject to the mortgagee\u2019s right to intervene in named conditions, the mortgagor should be entitled to deal with the mortgaged property in the ordinary way of his business and for the purposes of that business.\nAnd if that section has its full operation as respects such instruments when executed by individual traders, it is not easy to assign a reason for holding that it should not apply equally in the case of such instruments when executed by trading companies. The Act is general in its operation, and I can think of no reason, based on constitutional grounds, for holding that it is not applicable to instruments executed by Dominion companies.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs, and the judgment of Fisher J. restored.\nMIGNAULT J. concurs with Duff J.\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The question is whether the trust deed of 17th September, 1923, is a mortgage or a conveyance in- tended to operate as a mortgage within the meaning of the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act, of Ontario, R.S.O., 1914, c. 135, and it depends upon the intent of the instrument, by which, in order to secure the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds, the respondent, Larocque Co., sells, assigns, transfers, hypothecates, mortgages, pledges, sets over and charges, first, the real estate described, and secondly:\nall its movable assets for the time being, both present and future, of whatsoever kind and wheresoever situate, in the province of Ontario, hereinafter referred to as the \u201cfloating charged property\u201d and including its undertaking and its other property and assets, real, personal or mixed, present and future, not hereinbefore assured, together with all its present and future tolls, rents, revenues, incomes and sources of income, goodwill, chattels, stock-in-trade, plant, furniture, books of account, moneys, credits, things in action, contracts, agreements, bills, notes, negotiable and non-negotiable instruments, judgments, securities, rights, powers, patents, trademarks, copyrights, privileges and franchises, and all of the property and things of value of every kind and nature which the company may be or hereafter shall become possessed of or entitled to, providing that \u201cthe floating charge,\u201d created by this paragraph shall in no way hinder or prevent the company until the security hereby constituted shall become enforceable and the Trustee shall have demanded or become bound to enforce the same, either by dividends out of profits, leasing, mortgaging, pledging, selling, alienating or otherwise, disposing of or dealing with the subject matters of such \u201cfloating charge\u201d in the ordinary course of its business and for the purpose of carrying on the same.\nSome light may be afforded by considering the instrument in its application to a subsequent disposition by the company of existing assets made otherwise than \u201cin the ordinary course of business and for the purpose of carrying on the same.\u201d I apprehend that this would constitute default \u201cin the observance or performance of something hereby (by the trust deed) required to be observed and performed by the company.\u201d This default, if not made good, would terminate the company\u2019s right to possession, and the security would thereby become enforcible. The express permission which the company has to dispose of the assets described is limited to dispositions in the ordinary course of its business and for the purpose of carrying on the same, and it follows from the principle of interpretation expressed in the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius that it is not intended to reserve any other power of disposition. It is, I think, clear that the charge created is to have precedence of transfers made by the company otherwise than in the ordinary course of business, and it is from the time of its creation always effective for that purpose as against any assets, identified as within the description, which are thus disposed of. The provisions of the trust deed which it is said distinguish the sort of charge which it was intended to create from a mortgage, or a conveyance intended to operate as a mortgage, have no application to subsequent transfers not made in pursuance of the conceded power to deal with the subject-matter in ordinary course, and therefore an interest acquired by means of a disposition not permitted by the trust deed cannot prevail as against that of the trustee claiming by force of his original title. The instrument is in form and expression, to all intents and purposes, a mortgage, except that until the mortgagee take possession upon default the mortgagor retains a limited power of disposition.\nI know that it has been said by high authority that \u201ca floating security is not a specific mortgage of the assets plus a license to the mortgagor to dispose of them in the course of his business,\u201d per Buckley L.J. in Evans v. Rival Granite Quarries Ltd.[22] This observation is, I think, to be understood by applying the emphasis to the word \u201cspecific,\u201d because the learned Lord Justice, in the very same passage, speaks of a floating charge as a mortgage subject to a license to carry on business. Lord MacNaghten said, in Governments Stock and Other Securities Investment Co., Ltd., v. Manila Ry. Co., Ltd.[23],\nIt is of the essence of such a charge (a floating security) that it remains dormant until the undertaking changed ceases to be a going concern, or until the person in whose favour the charge is created intervenes.\nTherefore, if there be no period of dormancy, there is no floating charge. In the present case a charge is declared and established by the conveyance, and is, except by the exercise of a special power thereby stipulated, so to remain until satisfied, and if that be therefore not a floating charge, then it was a misnomer to describe the security as a floating charge; but, however that may be, the instrument is, I think, not inaptly described as a mortgage.

Having defaulted in payment to T., who pressed for payment, and having made some unsuccessful efforts to obtain a loan upon the land, they quit-claimed to T., and subsequently assigned their interest in the K. agreement to their mother, who obtained a transfer from T., and paid him off, having borrowed, on the security of the land, sufficient for that purpose. Creditors of the estate sought to charge the executors for a devastavit.\nHeld (reversing judgment of the Court of Appeal, Sask.\u201421 Sask. L.R. 91) that, on the evidence, the disposition by the executors of the K. agreement was not justified, and they should be charged; but not (as directed at trial) with the difference between the amount owing from K. and that owing to T., but only with the value, as of the date of the quit-claim, of the estate asset represented by the K. agreement, including the equity of the estate in the land; and interest.\nExecutors duties and liabilities, as to estate assets, and collection of moneys, discussed, with references to authorities.\nLand was sold, in 1920, under agreement of sale, for $38,280, payable, $5,000 down, and the balance \u201cby crop payments in annual instalments,\u201d with interest payable yearly, \u201cand in the event of default being made in payment of any sums payable hereunder (including taxes and insurance premiums) or any part thereof, the whole purchase money to forthwith become due and payable.\u201d The purchaser covenanted to pay \u201cthe said purchase price and interest as herein set forth.\u201d The vendor was to convey \u201con payment of all the said sum of money with interest as aforesaid in manner aforesaid.\u201d The purchaser agreed to farm and seed each year, to harvest, and to deliver to the vendor his share of the crop each year immediately after threshing. The share so delivered was to be applied, at the then market price of the grain, in payment of interest, any arrears, and on account of the purchase money. The purchase price was to be paid in full on or before 31st December, 1930, and if the crop payments should not by then \u201chave paid all sums payable hereunder, the balance unpaid shall on that date become due and payable * * * in lawful money of Canada.\u201d The purchaser\u2019s executors failed to pay certain taxes, and, crippled by crop failure in 1924, abandoned the land.\nHeld, the acceleration clause applied, and operated to make the whole balance of the purchase price forthwith due and payable in currency; it so operated, for default in payment of taxes, or for default in crop payments. (Judgment of the Court of Appeal, Sask., 21 Sask. L.R. 91, sustaining, on equal division, judgment of Brown C.J. on this point, affirmed).\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs in certain respects, and cross-appeal by the defendants in certain respects, from the judgment herein of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], on appeal from the judgment of Brown C.J. at trial.\nThe defendants were the executors of the estate of Thomas Newlove, deceased. The plaintiff Lemcke was the vendor of certain land, under agreement of sale, to the said deceased. The plaintiff Craik had an interest in the said agreement of sale and in the said land by reason of an assignment by Lemcke to him as collateral security for certain indebtedness.\nThe plaintiffs, in the action, claimed that default had been made under the said agreement of sale, and asked for judgment against the defendants for the amount alleged to be due and owing under the agreement, a declaration of a vendor\u2019s lien, a direction for sale, and judgment against the defendants for any deficiency. The defendants, among other defences, pleaded plene administravit. In regard to this defence the plaintiffs contended that the defendants had been guilty of a devastavit.\nThe three main questions before this Court, and the decisions thereon below, were as follows:\n(1) Whether the reasonable expenses of Mrs. Newlove, the defendants\u2019 mother, in connection with the management of the farm of the estate, should be allowed as a proper charge against the estate beyond what was realized upon the sale of certain stock and implements. Brown C.J. held that they should be allowed, and his judgment in this respect was affirmed by the Court of Appeal[2]. The plaintiffs appealed on this question.\n(2) Whether the defendants should be held liable for a devastavit, and, if so, in what measure, for their acts in regard to certain land which the deceased had purchased under agreement of sale from one Thompson, and had sold under agreement of sale to one Knox. The amount owing to the estate under the Knox agreement much exceeded that owing by the estate under the Thompson agreement. The defendants, under certain circumstances set out in the judgment now reported, quit-claimed their interest in the land to Thompson; and subsequently assigned all their interest in the Knox agreement to their mother. Thompson then transferred the land to the defendants\u2019 mother, and she borrowed, upon the security of the property, an amount sufficient to discharge the liability of the estate to Thompson, and paid him off. Brown C.J. held that the defendants should be charged with the difference, as of the date of the quit claim, between the amount owing from Knox and the amount owing to Thompson, and interest. The Court of Appeal[3] reversed this decision, and held that, under the circumstances in question, the defendants should not be held liable. The plaintiffs appealed on this question.\n(3) Whether, in view of the terms of the agreement of sale from the plaintiff Lemcke to the deceased, which was a \u201ccrop-payment\u201d agreement, the \u201cacceleration clause\u201d therein applied, so that, as the plaintiffs claimed, on the default that occurred the whole balance of the purchase price became due and payable. Brown C.J. upheld the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in this respect, and was sustained in the Court of Appeal upon an equal division of opinion3. The defendants cross-appealed on this question.\nThe material facts of the case bearing on the above questions are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported.\nW. H. B. Spotton K.C. for the appellant.\nW. H. McEwen K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014This action was brought by Chas. Lemcke, the vendor of lands described as the north half of s. 21, and the east half of s. 20, in township 26, range 4, west of the 3rd Meridian in Saskatchewan, and John S. Craik, who had an interest in these lands by way of collateral security, against the defendants, W. C. Newlove and Thos. H. Newlove, as executors of the last will and testament of the late Thos. Newlove, deceased, alleging an agreement of sale of 10th February, 1920, between the plaintiff Lemcke and the deceased Thos. Newlove, whereby the latter agreed to purchase the lands described for the sum of $38,280, payable $5,000 at the date of the agreement, and the remainder by crop payments in annual instalments, with interest at 7%; the purchaser agreeing also to pay the taxes and to insure the buildings; and whereby it was agreed moreover that, if the purchaser made default in his payments, the vendor might determine and put an end to the agreement. By the statement of claim it was alleged that the executors had made default in payment of principal, interest, taxes and insurance premiums stipulated for by the agreement, and that the whole purchase money had become due and payable by reason of the default. The plaintiffs therefore sought to recover $31,770.24, of which particulars were stated, claiming a vendor\u2019s lien for that amount; the sale of the lands; the application of the proceeds of the sale on account, and judgment against the defendants for the deficiency. The defendants pleaded, among other defences, plene administravit. The action was tried before the Chief Justice of the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Saskatchewan, who found for the plaintiffs upon the main question of default, and that the defendants should pay into court, to the credit of the cause, $32,057.41, with interest and costs; that the lands should be sold by the sheriff, if these moneys were not paid on or before the sale; the proceeds, after satisfying the expenses and costs, to be applied in payment of the net amount found due to the plaintiffs, with interest; the balance, if any, to be paid into court to the credit of the cause, and that the plaintiffs should have judgment against the defendants for deficiency \u201cto the extent that they (the defendants) have or should have assets of the deceased in their hands.\u201d A reference was also directed to the local registrar of the court at Moose Jaw to take the accounts of the defendants as executors, and to ascertain and report what assets of the deceased were or should be in their hands as such executors.\nThomas Newlove died on or about 8th September, 1921. The executors farmed the lands for several years thereafter, and it was directed by the judgment that they should be given credit for all expenses incurred in connection with that, including any reasonable amounts paid or allowed to Robt. Newlove, their brother, or Margaret Newlove, their mother, in connection with the management of the lands. Differences developed at the trial with regard to some matters connected with the administration, in respect of which it was alleged that the executors had been guilty of a devastavit, which had caused a failure of the assets, and the learned Chief Justice disposed of these by his judgment. Upon the appeal to this court only two of the charges, which I shall now explain, remain in question.\nThe executors, with the assistance of their brother, Robert, had worked the farm after the testator\u2019s death in 1921 and during 1922, but the results, particularly during the latter year, were not encouraging, and, at the end of that season, they made an arrangement with their mother, the details of which are not very satisfactorily proved, but it appears that she was to take over the management of the farm, and advance money when necessary to pay the debts and the operating expenses, for which she was to receive $50 a month, and that, if the proceeds of the crop were insufficient for the expenses and her remuneration, she was to be recouped out of the stock and implements. The defendant, Thos. H. Newlove, says, in his cross-examination:\nQ. Will you please tell me just what the agreement with your mother was?\nA. I agreed that my mother would have the management of the place. She would be paid $50 a month; she would pay any of the debts, that is the present debts that the estate owed, any of those that were asking us for payment; she would run the place and pay expenses out of the crop as far as it went, and any other expenses she would pay herself; and she would be recouped out of the stock and implements, chattels.\nLater, during the witness\u2019s cross-examination, his evidence upon discovery was read to him, in which he states the agreement as follows:\nA. I made a bargain with her to pay her $50 a month, and to pay the expenses of the farm out of the crop as far as it would go, and that she was to have the horses, the machinery and to pay out of her own money any deficit that might accumulate or any debts that might accumulate in connection with the running of that farm.\n* * *\nQ. 286. Well, then, was the arrangement between the executors and your mother that she was to accept the stock and implements in settlement of any claim she had against the estate for advances?\nA. For any advances she may have made.\nQ. 287. Whether it was more than what she realized out of the stock and implements or not?\nA. Whether it was more or less.\nQ. 288. She is not making any claim against the estate, and cannot make any claim against the estate for any surplus so advanced?\nA. There would be no use. There isn\u2019t any.\nQ. 289. But I mean, that was your bargain?\nA. That was the bargain?\nQ. 290. That was the bargain that was made in 1922?\nA. That was the bargain that was made in 1922.\nQ. Not up to this time\u2014\u2014?\nHere the witness interposed to say that these answers were not correct, and, later, when his attention was directed to the answer to the effect that his mother was to have the proceeds of the stock and implements, whether more or less than the amount of her personal advances, he answered that\nwhat I meant to say was that if the chattels came to more than what she advanced, she was to be paid what she advanced, but the rest would be estate money.\nAnd he maintained that the word \u201cless\u201d in his answer upon discovery was a mistake. The arrangement between the executors and their mother, whatever be the effect of it, was made orally, and there is no proof of it except by the evidence of Thos. H. Newlove.\nThe stock and implements were sold at public auction, realizing an amount insufficient to satisfy Mrs. Newlove for her outlay, and it was claimed on behalf of the plaintiffs that she was not entitled, under the arrangement in proof, to look to the executors for indemnity beyond what was realized upon the sale, and therefore that the balance was not chargeable against the estate. The learned Chief Justice however directed by his judgment that:\non the taking of the said accounts the executors be charged with the proceeds of the chattels sold at public auction in the fall of the year 1924, and that any reasonable expenses incurred by Mrs. Margaret Newlove in connection with the operation of the farm be allowed as a proper charge against the estate.\nThis direction, although confirmed upon review by the Court of Appeal, is one of the grounds of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal to this Court. I am of the opinion that the finding of the learned Chief Justice, with regard to the disposition of these expenses, upheld as it is by the Court of Appeal, ought not to be disturbed. It proceeds upon the interpretation of the oral testimony taken at the trial, and the credibility of the witness, as to which the finding at the trial should be accepted, since it is not clearly shown to be erroneous.\nThe executors produced an inventory of the testator\u2019s property for succession duty purposes, with the statutory affidavit; they included in this inventory an item reading as follows:\nN. \u00bd Sec. 31, Twp. 25, Rge. 4, West 3rd Meridian, Saskatchewan, purchased by deceased from one Richard A. Thompson by agreement for sale dated the 3rd day of December, 1917, under which there was owing by deceased at date of death the sum of $3,985.49, and sold by deceased to one Samuel Knox under agreement for sale dated January 31, 1920, under which there was owing to deceased at date of death the sum of $15,895.35, leaving a net equity in deceased at date of death $11,909.86. The fair market value, as well as the net value, of this property is stated in the inventory to be the above mentioned sum of $11,909.86. Evidence of the transaction was given at the trial corresponding to the description in the inventory. The agreement whereby the testator purchased the property from Thompson was produced, but the agreement between the testator and Knox was not produced. It is admitted that they were both half crop agreements, and moreover it was not disputed at the trial that the estate had a valuable equity in the Knox agreement. What happened with regard to it was this. In 1921 Knox paid to the defendants $913, and, in 1922, $1,070, on account of the purchase price. The defendants accounted to Thompson for the $913, but failed to account for the $1,070, which they applied in payment of their debts and operating expenses connected with the working of the farm. Thompson should have received the latter amount, and he insisted upon the payment. In the meantime Knox, considering that he had agreed to pay more for the land than it was worth, expressed his dissatisfaction with the agreement and threatened to leave the place, whereupon the defendants forgave him $3,000, on account of the price, a concession which both courts have found to be not unreasonable. Then, in order to accommodate the situation which had arisen as between themselves and Thompson, owing to the withholding of their share of the crop for 1922, they made some unsuccessful efforts to obtain a loan upon the land, and afterwards, on 9th July, 1923, quitclaimed their interest in the land to Thompson, and, by assignment of 21st July, 1923, to which Knox was a party, assigned all their interest in the Knox agreement to their mother for the expressed consideration of $4,000. Thompson then transferred the land to Mrs. Newlove, the mother of the executors, and she borrowed, upon the security of the property, an amount sufficient to discharge the liability of the estate to Thompson, and paid him off. It appears that at this time the Knox agreement was in good standing as between Knox and the estate, so far as delivery of half the crop was concerned, but that Knox was in default in the payment of taxes to the extent of $249, an amount Which apparently was subsequently paid by Mrs. Newlove. In the result, therefore, Mrs. Newlove acquired the Knox agreement, and the land therein described, by paying only the balance due to Thompson under his agreement with the testator; the estate thus seems to have received no benefit whatever from the asset, which, as already shewn, had been inventoried for succession duty purposes at $11,909.86, an amount which, however, should be reduced by the allowance of $3,000 which the executors subsequently made to Knox. In these circumstances, the learned Chief Justice directed that upon the taking of the accounts the defendants should be charged with the difference between the amount owing from Knox to the testator under the agreement of 31st January, 1920, and the amount owing from the testator to Thompson under the agreement of 3rd December, 1917, to purchase from Thompson, after allowing the reduction of $3,000 which the executors had conceded to Knox, this difference to be ascertained as of 9th July, 1923, and to bear interest from that date at the rate of seven per cent per annum. The Court of Appeal, on the contrary, was of the view, for reasons stated in the judgment of Martin J.A., that the executors, in the embarrassing circumstances in which they were placed, had acted honestly in accordance with what they considered to be in the best interests of the estate, and that, while they should, in the circumstances, have applied to the Court for advice, they might fairly be excused under the provision of s. 44 of the Trustee Act, R.S.S., 1920, c. 75; accordingly it was ordered that the judgment of the Chief Justice should be varied by striking out that portion of it which relates to the responsibility of the executors for the amount outstanding on the Knox agreement. The court has thus taken a benevolent view, and I would sustain it if I could, but I regret that I cannot, upon the evidence in the case, find any justification for the disposition of the Knox agreement which is disclosed. It was admittedly a valuable asset, and it passed into Mrs. Newlove\u2019s hands, inferentially by reason of a family arrangement, and without any apparent consideration moving from her to the estate. She was able to borrow upon the property an amount sufficient to discharge the vendor\u2019s claim, somewhat less than $4,000, and acquired the title subject to the sale to Knox, which must have shewn a profit, if it were carried out. There is no evidence whatever as to what was subsequently done with the property, or whether or not Knox completed his purchase. Mrs. Newlove gave no testimony, neither did the defendant Thos. H. Newlove\u2019s co-executor and co-defendant, although it would seem that, as he took nothing under the will, he left the administration of the estate in the hands of his brother, who was a beneficiary. The transaction indeed does not appear to differ substantially from a gift by the executors to their mother of the asset represented by the Knox agreement, and one way by which the executors may waste and misspend the testator\u2019s estate is, as we are told by Wentworth\u2019s Office and Duty of Executors, a work distinguished for its \u201csound principles and authentic information,\u201d p. 226; 14th Am. Ed., pp. 300, 301:\nBy the Executor his plain, palpable, and direct giving, selling, spending or consuming the Testator\u2019s Goods after his own will, leaving debts unpaid.\nTherefore I think that the learned Chief Justice was right in directing that the defendants should be charged, but I am afraid that some injustice may be done by his measure of the charge. It is laid down by the venerable authority which I have quoted, at p. 236, that a wasting executor shall incur damages or make his own goods liable no further than the value of the testator\u2019s goods wasted or mis-administered.\nThe appellants rely upon a passage in Williams on Executors which refers to Lowson v. Copeland[4], where Lord Thurlow held an executor liable to answer for 100 pounds not got in from a bond debt in consequence of his neglect to secure payment; but that decision relates to money lent upon a mere personal obligation. Powell v. Evans[5], is another case where the executors were charged with loss by neglecting to collect money lent by the testator upon a bond, and it was shown that the money could have been realized if the executors had been diligent, and there were also other special circumstances; it was there held that, inasmuch as the money was due upon personal security, the executors ought not, without great reason, to have permitted it to remain longer than was absolutely necessary. See also East v. East[6]; also Bailey v. Gould[7]. In the latter case, Alderson B., observed, at p. 226: But as to the \u00a350, it was outstanding on personal security which had been taken by the testator, and which had not been got in, but on which interest had been paid up to the date of the report. The Master took the correct distinction between property invested on real and property invested on personal estate; holding that, inasmuch as the personal security changes from day to day by reason of the personal responsibility of the party giving the security, and as a testator\u2019s means of judging of the value of that responsibility are put an end to by his death, therefore, although no loss may have occurred in the interval, the executor who has omitted to get it in within a reasonable time, becomes himself the security.\nThese cases rule in the circumstances to which they apply, but the general and reasonable rule, which should govern this case, is that stated by Wentworth, and by the Master of the Rolls (Sir John Romilly) in Clack v. Holland[8], where he says:\nWhere it is the duty of a trustee or executor to obtain payment of a sum of money, the trustee or executor is exonerated and never required to make good the loss, if he has done all he can to obtain payment, but his efforts have not proved successful. Nay, more, if he has taken no steps at all to obtain payment, but it appears that if he had done so, they would have been, or there is reasonable ground for believing that they would have been ineffectual, then he is exonerated from all liability.\nIn re Tucker[9].\nIn the present case the agreement for sale, which is not produced, had been made with the testator, and, while it probably embraced a covenant by the purchaser to pay the consideration money in the manner stipulated, the vendor meantime retained by way of security his interest in the land; and it is, I think, most probable that his security consisted chiefly of that interest. The purchaser, Knox, had performed his obligations, except as to the payment of some taxes, and there is no proof that the executors acted negligently or unreasonably, save with relation to the transactions by which the agreement and property passed from the executors to Mrs. Newlove. In respect of these transactions the asset was not properly administered, but the executors did not, I think, therefore incur a greater liability than to indemnify the estate for what it had lost.\nConsequently, while the judgment of the Court of Appeal as to the Knox agreement cannot, in my opinion, be upheld, that of the trial judge should be varied by directing that the defendants shall be charged only with the value, as of 9th July, 1923, of the estate asset represented by the Knox agreement, including the equity of the estate in the land therein described, and the interest.\nThis disposes of the items in question upon the appeal, and it follows that the appeal should be allowed in respect of the Knox agreement, and that the trial judgment should be restored subject to the variation which I have outlined. But inasmuch as the plaintiffs appeal upon two items, and have failed as to one, and, as to the other, have succeeded only partially, I would not allow costs.\nThere remains the defendants\u2019 cross-appeal, which raises an important question as to the interpretation of the agreement of purchase of 10th February, 1920, between the plaintiff, Chas. Lemcke, and the testator, Thos. Newlove. It is stipulated by the first clause of the agreement that the vendor agrees to sell, and the purchaser agrees to purchase, the land therein described, for the price of $38,280, payable as follows:\nthe sum of Five Thousand ($5,000) dollars on the day of the date hereof, the receipt whereof is hereby, by the vendor acknowledged, and the remaining sum of Thirty-three thousand two hundred and eighty dollars by crop payments, in annual instalments as hereinafter provided; together with interest at the rate of seven (7%) per centum per annum from the day of the date hereof, to be paid on the said sum or so much thereof as shall from time to time remain unpaid and as well after as up to maturity; such interest to be payable yearly on the First day of November until the whole of the moneys payable hereunder are fully paid and the first of such payments of interest to become due and be payable the first day of November, A.D. 1920; interest in arrear to be forthwith added to the principal and to bear interest at the said rate; and in the event of default being made in payment of any sums payable hereunder (including taxes and insurance premiums) or any part thereof, the whole purchase money to forthwith become due and payable.\nThe purchaser agreed to farm and seed the land each year, and to harvest the crops, and to deliver to the vendor his share of the crops each year immediately after the threshing. The executors, down to 1924, inclusive, accounted to the plaintiffs for their full half share of the crops, but in 1924 the wheat was almost a total failure, and the executors, after delivering to the plaintiffs their half share, could not pay the expenses or buy feed, and so they sold the stock and implements, and abandoned the land. Moreover they had not paid the taxes for 1923 or 1924, and the plaintiffs claimed in the action under the clause above quoted the whole purchase price, as payable in money. The learned trial judge upheld the claim, and he was sustained in the Court of Appeal upon an equal division of opinion, Lament and McKay JJ.A., holding that the acceleration clause did not apply, while the Chief Justice and Martin J. agreed with the trial judge. A similar question, in other cases, had previously given rise to some difference of judicial opinion in the Prairie Provinces. In Manitoba (Sherrin v. Wiggins[10]) Mathers C.J., had declined to give effect to such a clause in an agreement for the sale and purchase of land where the parties had contracted for the delivery of half the crops, but the agreement in that case seems to differ from this in material particulars. In Wellington v. Selig[11], the question came before the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan in a case which is perhaps indistinguishable, and the court divided equally upon it, Newlands and Lamont JJ.A., holding that it was impossible to accelerate payments which were to be made by delivery of crops, while the Chief Justice and Elwood J.A., would give effect to the clause. Subsequently, in Pattison v. Behr[12], McDonald J. held the clause applicable. To the like effect is the judgment of Bigelow J. in Central Canadian Securities Ltd. v. Brown[13].\nNow while it is true, as stated in some of these judgments, that crops to be grown in future years cannot be made actually deliverable at the present time, I am disposed, with great respect, to think that effect may be given to the clause in question in this agreement without attributing to the parties any such impossible intention. The consideration is stated in dollars, and, deducting the $5,000 which were to be paid down, the remainder is to be paid by \u201ccrop payments in annual instalments.\u201d The purchaser covenants with the vendor that he \u201cshall and will pay the vendor the said purchase price and interest as herein set forth.\u201d The vendor is to convey \u201con payment of all the said sum of money with interest as aforesaid in manner aforesaid.\u201d By the 9th clause of the agreement it is stipulated that:\nTHE SAID SHARE OF CROP so delivered under the provisions hereof by the purchaser to the vendor shall be by the vendor applied at the then market price of the grain, first, in payment of the interest payable hereunder in that year; next, in payment of arrears of any kind payable hereunder; and the balance on account of the purchase money. By clause 18 it is provided:\nNOTWITHSTANDING anything herein contained, it is agreed that the said purchase price of the said land is to be paid in full on or before the thirty-first day of December, A.D. 1930, and if the crop payments herein provided to be made shall not by that time have paid all sums payable hereunder, the balance unpaid shall on that date become due and payable by the (purchaser to the vendor in lawful money of Canada.\nThese and other provisions of the agreement show very clearly that the half crop delivered each year was to be taken as a payment in money, computed at its value in money, and that the delivery of crop is treated as payment to the extent of the market price of it. It is, of course, necessary to reach a conclusion whereby if possible a reasonable meaning may be given to every clause of the contract, and I have no doubt that, when the parties stipulated for the event of default being made in the payment of any sums payable under the contract, they had in mind the crop payments as sums payable thereunder. The clause was certainly never introduced with the object of providing for the event of the purchaser not paying down the $5,000 which was to be paid on the day of the date of the agreement; the vendor was absolutely protected as to that; but $33,280 still remained payable under the agreement, exclusive of taxes and insurance premiums, and this sum was, until 31st December, 1930, payable by crop payments. Therefore, except as to the taxes and insurance premiums, the clause can have no application, and is ineffective and useless, unless it be intended to operate in the event of default in the crop payments. Then the consequence of default is declared to be that the whole purchase money shall forthwith become due and payable. And, since crops to be grown in the future could not at the time of default be delivered, it is, I think, reasonable to conclude that the purchase money would at that time become due and payable in currency. But moreover, in this case, the executors were in default in payment of the taxes, and it is expressly stipulated that, in the event of such default, the whole purchase money shall forthwith become due and payable.\nClause 18, upon my interpretation, adds nothing to the case, except to suggest words by the use of which the difficulty which has arisen might have been avoided. Its purpose is to fix a date, 31st December, 1930, when the purchase price is to be paid in full, and beyond which the credit is not to be extended. The provision is that \u201cthe balance unpaid shall on that date become due and payable by the purchaser to the vendor in lawful money of Canada.\u201d The words \u201cin lawful money of Canada\u201d are thus introduced, and, if they had been expressed at the end of clause 1, the point in question could not have arisen, but, in my view, these words are necessarily implied at the end of the latter clause. \u201cThe whole purchase money,\u201d according to its meaning in the concluding lines of clause 1, must be figured in currency, and it is only in currency that it can forthwith become due and payable. I would dismiss the cross-appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed in part, without costs.\nCross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W. H. B.

The mining rights and surface rights were transferred separately, and were registered separately, under The Land Titles Act, Ont., in plaintiff\u2019s name. The property was within defendant township\u2019s territory, and it imposed municipal taxes in respect thereof, and, certain taxes remaining unpaid, it effected a sale by auction and gave the purchaser a tax deed. This recited that a warrant had issued commanding the treasurer \u201cto levy upon the land hereinafter mentioned for arrears of taxes due thereon\u201d, and that the treasurer had sold \u201cthat certain parcel or tract of land or premises hereinafter mentioned\u201d on account of arrears of taxes \u201calleged to be due thereon,\u201d etc., and purported to grant \u201call that certain parcel or tract of land and premises containing 20 acres, more or less, being composed of: the north half of parcel number 2831 in the register * * * and is described as follows: situate in the township of Bucke * * * namely: the north half of the north-east quarter of the south half of lot number 14 in the first concession * * * containing by admeasurement 20 acres more or less.\u201d Parcel 2831 in the register comprised only the mining rights. The assessment rolls were lost by fire. Plaintiff asserted right of ownership and asked to have the tax deed set aside.\nHeld, it must be presumed, in the absence of the assessment rolls, that the description in the deed conformed to that of the property assessed (that the property sold was that assessed, was also the clear purport of the deed\u2019s recitals); this description was ambiguous, as parcel 2831 mentioned comprised only the mining rights, while the particular description of the land which followed was a description of the land in which such mining rights would, if not excepted, be included; the mining rights, as such, were not assessable; but the township could assess the land, including the underlying minerals; the description of the subject of assessment being ambiguous, the presumption is that the township acted within its jurisdiction and assessed what it had power to assess; while the surface rights and mining rights were severable, and had, since the Crown grants, been dealt with as separate hereditaments, nevertheless, ownership of both having vested in the same corporation (the plaintiff), there could be valid assessment of the land, including the minerals, which The Assessment Act, s.40 (5), expressly contemplates; to make such assessment was apparently intended, and the description of the land, without exclusion of minerals, included the minerals therein contained; the assessment should, therefore, be treated as assessment of mineral land, and the words \u201cparcel number 2831\u201d, etc., might be disregarded as falsa demonstratio, or as inserted by mistake; without these words, there was sufficient description of the subject of assessment, and it is not material in what part of the description the falsa demonstratio occurs (Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 9th Ed., p. 404; Watcham v. Attorney General of the East Africa Protectorate, [1919] A.C. 533); construing the tax deed according to the same rules, and in conformity with its recitals, the purchaser acquired the land including the minerals.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario (58 Ont. L.R. 453) reversed.\nQuaere, whether merger is an appropriate term to describe the effect of the ownership of what had been separate hereditaments in the same area coalescing in the same person. APPEAL by the defendants the Corporation of the Township of Bucke, J.I. Ritchie and Alphonse Mondoux (the other defendants not appealing), from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] allowing an appeal from the judgment of Mowat J. at trial.\nThe action was brought for a declaration that the plaintiff is the owner of certain land, or, in the alternative, is the owner of the mines, minerals and mining rights in, upon and under the said land, and to set aside a certain tax sale, and tax sale deed, from the defendant the Corporation of the Township of Bucke to the defendant Ritchie. The interests of the other defendants existed by reason of certain transfers from the defendant Ritchie.\nThe trial judge, Mowat J., dismissed the action. The Appellate Division varied his judgment by declaring that the defendants are the owners, as their several interests may appear, of the surface rights of the land in question, but that the plaintiff is the owner, free of any claims on the part of the defendants, of the mines, minerals and mining rights in the land, and directing amendment of the land titles registers accordingly, and directing that the certificate of title issued to the defendant Ritchie be delivered up for cancellation.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was allowed with costs.\nA.G. Slaght K.C. for the appellants.\nA.M. Le Bel and W.J. Gilhooly for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The defendants, the corporation of the township of Bucke, J.I. Ritchie and Alphonse Mondoux (in the courts below J.N. Maloof and N.N. Maloof were also defendants, but have not appealed), appeal from a judgment of the second Appellate Divisional Court of Ontario which reversed, Latchford C.J. dissenting, the judgment of the trial judge, Mowat J. The litigation arose out of the following circumstances. On January 30th and February 1st, 1907, James A. Macrae and James A. Mulligan obtained two grants in fee simple from the Crown, in right of the province of Ontario, the first of mines, minerals and mining rights, and the second of surface rights, i.e., of land without the mines and minerals[2].\nIn the first grant, the property is described as follows:\nThe mines, minerals and mining rights in, upon and under all that parcel or tract of land situate, lying and being in the township of Bucke in the district of Nipissing, in the province of Ontario, containing by admeasurement forty acres be the same more or less, which said parcel or tract of land may be otherwise known as follows, that is to say, being composed of the northeast quarter of the south half of lot no. 14 in the first concession of the said township of Bucke.\nThe description of the property conveyed by the second grant is the same as that contained in the first grant from the words \u201call that parcel or tract of land\u201d, inclusive, to the end of the extract above quoted. In this grant, ores, mines or minerals are excepted.\nThe sale of the mining rights was made under The, Mines Act, 1906, 6 Edw. VII, c. 11, and, as shewn by the price paid ($60.00), was of \u201cmining rights\u201d as distinguished from \u201cmining lands\u201d (s. 174 of the Act).\nBoth grants were registered under The Land Titles Act at North Bay, the grant of the mining rights being entered as parcel 4059 and the grant of the surface rights as parcel 4163.\nIn October and December, 1907, Macrae and Mulligan assigned to the respondent company their rights in the properties conveyed by these two grants, each of them transferring by separate transfers the mining rights and the surface rights.\nIn these transfers, the mining rights (referred to as parcel 4059 in the register for the district of Nipissing) are described as\nthe mines, minerals and mining rights in, upon and under the land hereinafter particularly described, namely, the northeast quarter of the south half of lot no. 14 in the first concession of the township of Bucke, containing by admeasurement forty acres, more or less.\nAnd the description of the surface rights (referred to as parcel 4163 in the same register) is as follows:\nthe land hereinafter particularly described, namely: the northeast quarter, etc., etc. (ut supra). The mining rights and the surface rights, thus registered separately, so remained on the register of land titles in the name of the respondent company for more than ten years. The parcel numbers, however, were changed at some time which is not mentioned, apparently upon the establishment of a new land titles office for the northern division of Nipissing, and the parties agree that parcel 4059 (the mining rights) and parcel 4163 (the surface rights) in the register of Nipissing became respectively parcel 2831 and parcel 2899 in the register for \u201cNipissing North Division.\u201d It also appears that, since the tax sale and transfer to which I will refer, the north half of the northeast quarter of the south half of lot no. 14, alleged to have been sold for taxes, is described as parcel 928 in the register for \u201cSouth Temiskaming\u201d in the land titles office at Haileybury. I merely mention this parcel number without for the moment entering upon the question whether it covers the surface rights, or the mining rights, or both.\nThe property in question lies within the territory administered by the corporation of the Township of Bucke, which I will call the Corporation. Municipal taxes in respect of this property were imposed by the corporation on the respondent, and these taxes for the years 1916, 1917 and 1918 were not paid and remained unpaid for more than two years thereafter.\nIn 1920, the corporation caused a sale by auction to be effected for these taxes, and the purchaser was one John I. Ritchie. Subsequently the warden and the treasurer of the township executed a transfer in favour of Ritchie, the construction of which is in issue between the parties, the respondent contending that it comprised merely the surface rights, while the appellants argue that with the surface rights the mining rights were conveyed to Ritchie. This transfer, which is undated, was filed in the land titles office at Haileybury on the 11th of June, 1921.\nS. 66 of The Land Titles Act (R.S.O., 1914, ch. 126) requires that, where a sale is made for taxes, a notice of the lodging of the transfer for registration be given to the persons who appear by the register to be interested in the land, and the deputy local master of titles at Haileybury sent a notice by registered letter to \u201cMacrae Mining Co. Ltd., Try Toronto, Ont.\u201d The respondent\u2019s office is at Ottawa and the letter was returned marked \u201cnot found\u201d; but as the respondent had not registered its address as required by s. 112 of The Land Titles Act, and as no address is given in the other registered documents, the respondent cannot rest anything on insufficiency of the notice.\nThe transfer was registered and Ritchie\u2019s name was entered in the register as owner (vested in fee) of parcel 928 \u201cwith an absolute title of the mines, minerals and mining rights in, upon and under.\u201d He received from the local master of titles a certificate of title under The Land Titles Act for parcel 928. He executed several transfers of parts of or shares in parcel 928, and the transferees were made defendants in this action.\nThe record contains a copy of the register with respect to parcels 928 and 2,899, as the register stood on the 3rd of November 1925, for parcel 928, and on the 4th of November, 1925, for parcel 2,899. In the register, parcel 928 appears to stand for the mining rights of the north half of the respondent\u2019s forty acres, while the surface rights in these forty acres are still called parcel 2,899, N.N.D.\nUnder these circumstances, the respondent, in May, 1925, brought an action against the appellants and the two Maloofs, asserting its right of ownership in these parcels, and asking that the tax deed or transfer be declared null and void. The learned trial judge dismissed the action on the ground that the respondent was too late to impeach the tax deed, in view of s. 178 of The Assessment Act (R.S.O., 1914, ch. 195). This judgment was, however, reversed by the Appellate Divisional Court which decided, on the construction of the tax deed and transfer, that it covered only the surface rights. The learned judges considered the description in the deed ambiguous with its reference to the north half of parcel 2,831 followed by a particular description which they thought could only apply to the surface rights. Being of the opinion that the mining rights, as such, were not assessable (and in this Latchford C.J. concurred), they held that the deed should be restricted to the surface rights, for otherwise it would be void: ut magis valeat quam pereat.\nIn my opinion, the mining rights, as such, were not assessable for municipal taxes. The relevant section of The Assessment Act (R.S.O., 1914, ch. 195) is section 40, subsections 4, 5 and 6 of which are in the following terms:\n(4) The buildings, plant and machinery in, on or under mineral land, and used mainly for obtaining minerals from the ground, or storing the same, and concentrators and sampling plant, and, subject to subsection 8, the minerals in, on or under such land, shall not be assessable.\n(5) In no case shall mineral land be assessed at less than the value of other land in the neighbourhood used exclusively for agricultural purposes.\n(6) The income from a mine or mineral work shall be assessed by, and the tax leviable thereon shall be paid to the municipality in which such mine or mineral work is situate. Provided that the assessment on income from each oil or gas well operated at any time during the year shall be at least $20.\nMr. Slaght, for the appellants, argued that as, under s. 2, ss. (h), of The Assessment Act, the word\u2019s \u201cland,\u201d \u201creal property\u201d and \u201creal estate\u201d include all mines, minerals, etc., in and under land, and as, in a sale from subject to subject of land containing minerals, the latter pass to the purchaser without special mention, the tax sale of the land carried with it the minerals, and consequently Ritchie became owner of these mining rights.\nHe also contended that, inasmuch as s. 40 of The Assessment Act is under the heading \u201cValuation of lands,\u201d the provisions of ss. 4 must be taken to mean, not that minerals, qua minerals, cannot be assessed, but that their value is not to be considered in valuing the land subject to assessment.\nThe second contention, in my opinion, ignores the plain language of the statute. Subsection 4 states that, subject to subsection 8 (which has no application here), \u201cthe minerals in, on or under such land, shall not be assessable.\u201d The meaning of the three subsections, when read together, is obvious. Minerals, as such, that is to say minerals considered as a subject of ownership distinct from the ownership of the land in which they are contained, are not assessable (subsection 4). Land containing minerals is however assessable as land, but it is not to be assessed at less than the value of other land in the neighbourhood used exclusively for agricultural purposes (subsection 5). And the income derived from a mine or mineral work, which supposes that minerals have been extracted from the land, is also assessable (subsection 6).\nThe question involved in Mr. Slaght\u2019s first contention is: What, on the proper construction of the tax deed and transfer, was the subject of the sale? We have not the assessment rolls for the years 1916, 1917 and 1918, which were destroyed in the great fire at Haileybury some years ago. We know, however, that on the register of the land titles office the mining rights and the surface rights were entered as separate subjects of ownership, and each had a parcel number distinguishing it from the other. In the grants from the Crown and in the assignments from the original grantees they were also treated as separate properties.\nLooking now at the tax deed and, transfer, which follows the form prescribed by The Assessment Act (section 173 and form 12), it recites that a warrant had issued under the hand of the warden and seal of the township commanding the treasurer \u201cto levy upon the land hereinafter mentioned, for arrears of taxes due thereon,\u201d and that, on the 16th of February, 1920, the treasurer had sold by public auction to John I. Ritchie \u201cthat certain parcel or tract of land or premises hereinafter mentioned,\u201d at and for the price of $136.52, on account of arrears of taxes \u201calleged to be due thereon\u201d up to the 31st of December, 1918, together with costs. Then follows the operative clause, by which\nthe Warden and Treasurer of the said Township, in pursuance of such sale, and of \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d and for the consideration aforesaid, do hereby Grant, Bargain and Sell unto the said John I. Ritchie, his heirs and assigns, ALL THAT certain parcel or tract of land and premises containing twenty acres, more or less, being composed of: The North half of Parcel Number 2831 in the register for Nipissing North Division and is described as follows: Situate in the Township of Bucke in the District of Nipissing North Division, namely: The North half of the Northeast quarter of the south half of Lot Number Fourteen in the first Concession of the said Township of Bucke containing by admeasurement twenty Acres more or less.\nExcepting five per cent of the acreage thereby granted for roads and the right to lay the same where the Crown or its officers may deem necessary.\nI think it must be presumed, in the absence of the assessment rolls, that the description in this transfer conformed to the description of the property assessed in the assessment rolls for 1916, 1917 and 1918. That the property sold and transferred was the property which had been assessed is also the clear purport of the recitals of the transfer.\nWe have, therefore, assessments in the terms of the description in the transfer. It seems unquestionable that this description is ambiguous, for parcel 2831 on the register, at the time of the sale, comprised only the mining rights, while the particular description of the land which followed was a description of the land in which such mining rights would, if not excepted, be included.\nIt has already been stated that the mining rights, as such, were not assessable. On the other hand, the corporation could assess the land, including the underlying minerals. The description of the subject of the assessments being ambiguous, the presumption is that the corporation acted within the limits of its jurisdiction and assessed what it had the power to assess, for otherwise the assessments would be void. This is the familiar rule of construction expressed by the maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat (Broom, Legal Maxims, p. 343 and following).\nThere is no doubt that the surface rights and the mining rights were severable. Since the grants from the Crown, they had been dealt with as separate and distinct hereditaments. Nevertheless, ownership of both having vested in the same corporation, there could be valid assessments of the land containing and including the minerals, which the statute (s. 40, ss. 5) expressly contemplates. To make such assessments was apparently intended, and the description of the land, without exclusion of minerals, includes the minerals therein contained. The assessment should, therefore, be treated as assessments of mineral land, and the words \u201cParcel number 2831, etc.,\u201d may be disregarded or struck out as a falsa demonstratio, or as inserted by mistake. Without these words, there is adequate and sufficient description of the subject of the assessments, and it is not material in what part of the description the falsa demonstratio occurs (Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 9th Ed., p. 404, Watcham v. Attorney General of the East Africa Protectorate[3].\nThe assessments being regarded as of mineral lands, and the transfer being construed according to the same rules, and in conformity with its recitals of a levy upon and a sale of \u201cthe land\u201d described, Ritchie acquired that land including the minerals in and beneath it. This also applies to the interest that Mondoux took by virtue of the transfer which Ritchie made to him.\nUnder these circumstances, it is unnecessary to invoke s. 178 of The Assessment Act, on which the learned trial judge relied, and which renders valid and binding a tax sale unless it be questioned within two years, unless indeed to meet other objections to the tax sale not relied upon in this court by the respondent.\nSection 42 of The Land Titles Act confirms in the appellants Ritchie and Mondoux an absolute title to what was transferred to them.\nIt appears unnecessary to discuss the question of merger referred to in the arguments and in the judgment appealed from. It may, perhaps, be open to question whether merger is an appropriate term to describe the effect of the ownership of what had been separate hereditaments in the same area coalescing in the same person.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Appellate Divisional Court and the judgment of the trial judge should be restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Arthur G. Slaght.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Arthur M. LeBel.\n[1] (1926) 58 Ont.

Compensation to the lessee will not be confined to the value of the unexpired term, but will; include all loss naturally resulting from the eviction.\nThe impossibility of assessing with mathematical accuracy the damages to a wrongfully evicted lessee for the loss of the unexpired term of a farm lease does not relieve the lessor from liability for such damages; and the court may award an amount though it may be to some extent speculative. The actual results from working the land between the date of the eviction and the time of the trial should be taken into account. Estimates of damages as to future years should be based on the assumption, not of unusual, but of normal, conditions as they have existed in the past.\nLessees of farm property sued for damages for wrongful eviction. They were awarded at trial, ([1925] 3 W.W.R. 769), $1,217 for summer-fallowing done by them, and $22,500 for loss of the unexpired term (about five years). The Court of Appeal, Sask. (21 Sask. L.R. 19; ([1926] 3 W.W.R. 11) reduced the $22,500 to $2,500.\nHeld, on the evidence, and having regard to the actual results from working the land between the date of eviction and time of trial, the average yield for preceding years, the conditions in the district, and the nature of the land (and taking into account the cost of operating, marketing, etc., and other circumstances), that the allowance by the Court of Appeal was insufficient; but that the allowance by the trial judge, who had not given due regard to the uncertainty of the price of wheat or the possibility of the lessees earning on another farm, was excessive; and that the damages should be $15,000, covering both the summer-fallowing and the loss of the unexpired term.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan[1] reducing the amount of damages awarded to the plaintiffs by the trial judge, Bigelow J.[2], from $23,717 to $3,717. The plaintiffs were lessees from the defendant of certain farm lands, and the action was brought to recover damages for alleged wrongful dispossession, in breach of the covenant in the lease for quiet enjoyment. There were a number of issues raised in the courts below, but the only question before this Court was as to the quantum of damages.\nThe trial judge allowed the plaintiffs $1,217 in respect of certain summer-fallowing that they had done on the land, and $22,500 for loss of the unexpired term. The Court of Appeal did not disturb the allowance for summer-fallowing, but reduced the amount allowed for loss of the unexpired term to $2,500. The plaintiffs appealed against this reduction. The material facts bearing on the question are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported.\nP. M. Anderson K.C. for the appellants.\nJ. F. Bryant for the respondent.\nThe judgment.of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014This case comes to us from the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. It arises out of the breach by the respondent Martin of a covenant for quiet enjoyment, in a lease of a certain tract of land in the Milestone district of the province of Saskatchewan to the appellants, Haack Brothers. The lease was dated the 26th February, 1924, and was made for six years on the basis of a yearly rental of a share of the crop.\nIn October, 1924, the Canada Trust Company, claiming through or under the respondent, interrupted and disturbed the appellants in their possession and evicted them from the land. There was no justification whatever for the eviction. The respondent contended that the appellants had not farmed or summer-fallowed the lands properly and, in fact, filed a counter-claim based upon these complaints; but they were held groundless by the trial judge, who found that the appellants had farmed and summer-fallowed the lands in a reasonably good and husband-like manner. These findings were concurred in by the Court of Appeal.\nBoth courts were of opinion that the plaintiffs were entitled to damages for the disturbance in their possession; but they differed on the quantum of damages to be awarded. The trial judge held that the appellants should recover $2,717 for the summer-fallow done by them on the property. As they had already been paid $1,500, they were allowed the balance of $1,217. The Court of Appeal confirmed this allowance.\nBut the trial judge assessed the damages of the appellants through the loss by them of the unexpired term of their lease at $22,500. The Court of Appeal reduced that amount to $2,500.\nThe appeal is only as to this quantum of damages, and there is no cross-appeal. The learned trial judge thought that the plaintiffs were entitled to the value of the unexpired term and that such value was to be arrived at in this way:\nThe rental value to the plaintiffs was two-thirds of the crop, and to estimate that we have to consider the cost of working the farm, and the probable profits. The average crop for the last ten years was twenty bushels to the acre; two-thirds of the land would be put in crop each year; 1,280 acres at 20 bushels to the acre would be 25,600 bushels of wheat that would be grown on that land in an average year; at a dollar a bushel that would be worth $25,600; two-thirds of that would be $16,167. Deduct $3,000, the outside cost of operating, would represent a profit of $8,167. The general evidence that a reasonable value of the unexpired term would be $1,500 a section, or $4,500 for the land in question per year, would seem well within the mark. That amount for five years would be $22,500.\nMr. Justice McKay, speaking for the Court of Appeal, said that he could not agree with this valuation. According to him,\nthis method of arriving at the value of the unexpired term to the plaintiffs depends upon too many contingencies, upon which the success of raising a crop rests. There is always the risk of drought, hail, and frost and other things, which cause crop failures. * * * There is also the uncertainty of the price of wheat to be considered. * * * It also assumes that plaintiffs cannot do any other work during the unexpired term of the lease.\nBecause, however, these damages could not be assessed with certainty was no reason, in his opinion, why the appellants should not be entitled to substantial damages. Under all the circumstances of the case, he did \u201cnot think it unreasonable to allow plaintiffs $2,500 damages for the unexpired term, in addition to the $1,217, altogether amounting to $3,717.\u201d\nAgainst this variation of the judgment of the trial court, the plaintiffs now appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, asking the restoration of the amount awarded by the trial judge, or such other amount as the Supreme Court will deem proper.\nThere is no special rule in regard to damages recoverable by a wrongfully evicted lessee. The case is governed by the general rule applicable to all breaches of contract, and laid down as follows by Parke B. in Robinson v. Harman[3].\nThe rule of the common law is that where a party sustains a loss by reason of a breach of contract, he is, so far as money can do it, to be placed in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed.\nThis was quoted with approval as being \u201ca rule of good sense\u201d in Lock v. Furze[4], where the plaintiffs sued upon the covenant for quiet enjoyment contained in a void lease. There, Channell B. (p. 452) said:\nI take the indisputable rule of law to be, that, where a man enters into a contract, and fails to perform it, he must make compensation to the extent of the injury sustained by the person with whom he has contracted.\nIn the case of a lease, the compensation will not be confined to the value of the term, but will include all loss naturally resulting from the eviction. Such is the effect of the judgment in Grosvenor Hotel Company v. Hamilton[5], where the lessee claimed damages as the consequence of a nuisance caused by his lessor. Vibration resulting from the working of engines on land adjacent to the demised premises had damaged the house rented to the lessee to such an extent that the premises became useless to him and he was obliged to remove his business to another house. The lessor was held liable in damages on the ground that the landlord could not defeat his own grant contained in the lease, and Lindley L.J. said (p. 840):\nThere being a good cause of action, the question of damages arises. It is contended for the plaintiffs that the damages consist solely in the loss of the term. If the term were of value, the defendant could recover its value by way of damages; but to say that the damages are confined to the value of the term is erroneous in point of law. The damages are whatever loss results to the injured party as a natural consequence of the wrongful act of the defendant.\nThe difficulty, however, lies in ascertaining the true extent of the pecuniary loss naturally flowing from the breach. With regard to the first year after the eviction, there are in the record, as will appear presently, sufficient elements to estimate the loss with a reasonable degree of certainty. It is not so for the subsequent years, as to which the exact data are of course lacking and the evidence is somewhat conjectural. The average yield since 1910 of the lands rented, and the normal cost of production and of marketing are known. It is established that the land \u201cis away better,\u201d and would ordinarily produce per acre five bushels more, than the \u201caverage land.\u201d Experience has shown that failures are unusual in that district and that none have occurred for the last fifteen years. Such evidence\u2014which is goes towards extenuating some of the possibilities and of the contingencies dreaded by the Court of Appeal. It is not unreasonable to assume that the same land, year in and year out, will produce the same results. Estimates must be based on the assumption, not of unusual, but of normal, conditions as they have existed in the past. Otherwise the ordinary conduct of business would be a practical impossibility.\nWhen the respondent and the appellants in this case got together on the 26th day of February, 1924, and made the agreement whereby the respondent leased his lands and the appellants promised to pay the yearly rental of one-third of the crop, no doubt the crop each party anticipated was the average crop grown on these lands during the previous years; and the value to each of them of such average crop may reasonably be considered as representing the dam^ ages within the contemplation of the parties, if for some reason they happened to be deprived of their share or portion of the yearly rental. Such therefore, in this case, is the measure whereby the damages must be computed, in addition to any actual loss or expense that may be established.\nThe learned trial judge did take into consideration the average crop for the last ten years, the total absence of failures during a still longer period of years, the cost of operating the farm and of marketing the grain, and he estimated thereby the yearly profit which that would represent for the five years to run of the unexpired lease. He did not however allow any offset for the uncertainty of the price of wheat, a very material element in the computation of damages of this character. Neither did he consider the possibility of the appellants earning on another farm. Although, during the interval between the eviction and the trial, they were \u201cunable to get a similar lease of as good land in the Milestone district,\u201d it cannot be expected that such a condition would be likely to persist during the remaining four years. They had been set free and they could work elsewhere. They may possibly have secured a lease yielding benefits equal to\u2014if not higher than\u2014 those which they could have derived from the cancelled lease. In either case, their loss after the first year would be negligible, if not wholly eliminated.\nIt must not be forgotten also that any amount awarded to the appellants is to be paid at once and can be put to profitable use immediately, while the money earned on the farm would be available only by fractions and from year to year.\nWe agree therefore with the Court of Appeal that the award made by the trial judge was excessive and could not be maintained. But the appellants have also satisfied us that the allowance of $2,500 made by the Court of Appeal for the whole of the unexpired term is utterly insufficient.\nThe eviction of the appellants occurred in October, 1924. The trial took place in November and December, 1925. Evidence was given of what actually happened in 1925. We know what the crop was and that the profit derived from the lands by those who replaced the appellants was close to $12,000.\nIn Findlay v. Howard[6], this Court held that\nin an action for damages for loss of future profits arising out of a wrongful breach of partnership contract, events which happened between the date of the commission of the wrong and the time of the trial must be taken into account in estimating the loss for which the plaintiff is entitled to compensation and in determining what actually was the value of the contract to him at the date of the breach.\nWe see no reason why this rule should not apply here. If the appellants had not been dispossessed, they would have had the benefit of the profits of 1925. It may be that they would not have done just as well as their successors. They may not have had all the equipment required for a two thousand acre farm. But all allegations of improper farming made against them were disbelieved by both courts. They were held to have shown themselves competent farmers. Nevertheless, in the computation of the damages allowed by either court, the actual results for the year 1925 appear to have been altogether disregarded. There was nothing speculative about them. The appellants were entitled to ask that these results be taken into account in ascertaining their damages, for the holding was that during that time they were unable to earn anything elsewhere, although they used all reasonable efforts to get other land and, in the words of the trial judge, they \u201cdid everything possible to minimize the loss.\u201d For this reason the judgment of the Court of Appeal must be modified. Of course, the year 1925 was admittedly an exceptional year and could not be set up as a standard. But it shows conclusively to our mind that the amount allowed by the Court of Appeal must be materially increased. It is obviously impossible to assess the damages \u201cwith mathematical accuracy,\u201d but that is not necessary, and such impossibility \u201cdoes not relieve the wrongdoer of the necessity of paying for his breach of contract\u201d (Chaplin v. Hicks[7]).\nAny amount awarded must be to some extent speculative. We must proceed \u201clargely as a jury.\u201d We have, however, the benefit of the calculations made by the learned trial judge and by the Court of Appeal. If we apply to their figures the corrections which, in our view, are made necessary for the reasons which we have given, we think that an amount of $15,000, covering both the summer-fallowing and the loss of the unexpired term is justified upon the evidence in the record. This is, of course, without prejudice to the amount allowed on the counter-claim with which we are not concerned. It also leaves untouched the order as to costs and as to the right to set-off made by the Court of Appeal.\nThe appeal should be allowed to the extent indicated, and the appellants should have their costs before this Court.\nAppeal allowed, to extent indicated, with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Anderson, Bayne & Bigelow.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bryant & Burrows.\n[1] 21 Sask.

Co. As these shares were registered in the name of an enemy bank, payments of dividends were withheld during the War, the Custodian becoming entitled to receive them by the trading with the enemy regulations. The dividends were, however, retained by C. Co. After the peace, the claimant established his right to the shares and accrued dividends; the Custodian released them; and on 1st June, 1921, C. Co. registered the shares in the claimant\u2019s name and paid him the dividends accrued after 1st October, 1917, but still withheld the previous dividends. These were paid in March, 1924, except as to disputed claims to premium of exchange and interest. The dividends were payable in United States currency. The payment in 1924 was in the Canadian equivalent of the amount in United States funds, as of February, 1924. The Custodian, under an arrangement, assumed C. Co.\u2019s liability to the claimant for the balance of his claim, both for premium of exchange and for interest, and the claimant sued the Custodian in the Exchequer Court. Audette J. held ([1926] Ex. C.R. 77) that the claimant should be paid at the rate of exchange ruling on the date when each dividend became due and payable to the Custodian, and should be paid interest from 1st June, 1921. The Custodian appealed, denying the claimant\u2019s right to interest; and the claimant cross-appealed, claiming the difference in exchange as of 1st June, 1921, or, in the alternative, more interest.\nHeld, the rate of exchange should be that which ruled at the time when each of the dividends became due and payable to the Custodian, who was the lawful recipient during the war, and not that of 1st of June, 1921, when the claimant became entitled to receive them; had there been no war, the conversion to Canadian money should have been made as at the time when the obligation to pay in foreign currency was incurred, that is, the respective dates when the dividends were declared to be payable (cases cited); and the fact that, at the times fixed for payment, the claimant\u2019s right to receive them was suspended by reason of the war, was not a ground for application of a different rule. Held, further, that, having regard to s. 34 of the Ontario Judicature Act, and to its interpretation in Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto ([1906] A.C. 117, at pp. 120-121), interest should be paid from 1st June, 1921, as upon a just debt improperly withheld; the dividends constituted a \u201cdebt\u201d within the meaning of the interpretation given to the statute; the right of recovery was in suspense during the war, but the debt nevertheless remained; that the dividends were payable in U.S. currency did not alter their character as a debt (In re Severn and Wye and Severn Bridge Ry. Co., [1896] 1 Ch. 559; Ehrensperger v. Anderson, 3 Ex. 148; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des H\u00f4tels le Toquet Paris-Plage v. Cummings, [1922] 1 K.B. 451; Manners v. Pearson, [1898] 1 Ch. 581, referred to); the claimant\u2019s contention that interest should be reckoned from the respective dates when the dividends were declared, could not succeed, because these were not contractually interest bearing debts, and the withholding of the dividends during the war was lawful, and therefore should not be visited by damages.\nAPPEAL by the Custodian from the judgment of Audette J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] in so far as it allowed the claimant\u2019s claim to interest; and cross-appeal by the claimant from the said judgment in so far as it held that the rate of exchange for conversion into Canadian currency of the dividends payable to him must be the rate ruling on the date when each dividend became due and payable to the Custodian, and not the rate of exchange as of 1st June, 1921, as claimed by the claimant; and, in the alternative, if the said judgment be held to be correct as to the time or times for conversion into Canadian funds of the dividends in question, then in so far as the said judgment awarded interest only from 1st June, 1921, and not from the respective dates when each dividend became due and payable to the Custodian.\nThe material facts of the case, and the respective contentions of the parties, are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported.\nG. Wilkie K.C. and J. Mulvey for the appellant.\nJ. W. Bain K.C. and E. Bristol for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014This case was tried upon admissions, and there is an appeal and cross-appeal.\nAt the beginning of the War, 420 shares of the capital stock of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, which were registered in the name of the Nationalbank fur Deutchsland, belonged to the claimant, who was a British subject; and, as this was an enemy bank, payments of dividends upon the stock were of course withheld during the War, the Custodian becoming entitled to receive them by the trading with the enemy regulations. The dividends were nevertheless retained by the Railway Company, although subsequently, by order of the Superior Court of Quebec of 23rd April, 1919, the shares registered in the name of the Nationalbank fur Deutchsland, including those of the claimant, were, together with the dividends, declared to be vested in the Custodian, and moreover, pursuant to the order, the stock was registered in his name. The claimant, after the peace with Germany, established his status as a British subject, and his right to the 420 shares and the accrued dividends; the Custodian released them; and, on 1st June, 1921, the Railway Company registered the shares in the name of the claimant, and paid to him the dividends accrued after 1st October, 1917, but the previous dividends, amounting to $13,650, were still withheld by the company. It is admitted that these dividends were payable in United States currency, and the claimant therefore sought to recover from the company payment, not only of the said sum of $13,650, but also 12% thereof for excess value of United States funds, that being the rate of exchange in favour of the United States prevailing on 1st June, 1921, when the claimant\u2019s stock was restored; he also claimed interest thereon from the latter date. The Railway Company having refused to recognize this claim, the claimant instituted an action in Ontario against the company to recover these amounts, and that action was, on 3rd March, 1924, settled by payment of $14,085.09, the Canadian equivalent of $13,650 in United States funds as of February, 1924, the latter being then at a premium of 3\u00b72%. At the same time an arrangement was made between the parties and the Custodian, the reasons for which are not disclosed, by which the Custodian assumed the liability of the Railway Company to the claimant for the balance of his claim, both for premium of exchange and for interest. Afterwards the claimant instituted proceedings in the Exchequer Court of Canada against the Custodian to recover $3,309.72, according to the following particulars: 1st June, 1921\u2014\nMarket value in Canada of $13,650 in United States\nfunds then at a premium of 12 per cent.............................................................. $15,288.00\nInterest thereon to 3rd March, 1924, at 5 per cent................................................. 2,106.81\n$17,394.81\n3rd March, 1924\u2014\nBy cash, being value of $13,650 in United States\nfunds then at a premium of 3\u00b72 per cent.............................................................. 14,085.09\nBalance due as of 3rd March, 1924..................................................................... $ 3,309.72\nBy the judgment of the Exchequer Court, the claimant recovered $1,641.27, the learned judge finding, for reasons which he states and upon the authorities to which he refers,\nthat the rate for conversion must be the rate ruling on the date when each dividend became due or payable to the Custodian, and not either the 1st of June, 1921, or the 3rd of March, 1924, that is at the date of the breach or default (such) a sum in Canadian currency as would at that date have been produced by the American currency.\nAnd he found that the claim for interest, upon the amount as so figured, should be allowed.\nThe Custodian appeals, denying the plaintiff\u2019s right to interest; and the claimant cross-appeals, claiming the difference in exchange as of 1st June, 1921; or, in the alternative, more interest.\nOn behalf of the Custodian, it is maintained that this is an action, not of debt, but to recover damages for nondelivery of United States currency which must be treated as a mere commodity, and that the measure of damages is not interest to compensate for delay in payment, but is to be ascertained as in the case of goods, by comparison of the contract price with the market price at the time of delivery.\nNow it is settled law that interest is payable only by statute, or when contracted for, and, as there is in this case no contract to pay interest, the right therefore must rest upon statute. The liability for interest in judicial proceedings is regulated in Ontario by sections 34 and 35 of the Judicature Act; and, although there was some discussion of s. 35 at the hearing, it became in the end matter of common ground that s. 34 is, for this case, the governing provision; it enacts that \u201cInterest shall be payable in all cases in which it is now payable by law, or in which it has been usual for a jury to allow it.\u201d Mr. Holmested, in his 4th ed. at p. 195, very truly says that \u201cInterest is in practice more frequently allowed by our juries than English authorities would seem to warrant,\u201d and the highest authority for this statement is to be found in Lord Macnaghten\u2019s judgment in the Judicial Committee in Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[2], where, referring to the section which I have quoted, and to the provincial decisions in which it had been expounded, His Lordship said:\nThe result, therefore, seems to be that in all cases where, in the opinion of the Court, the payment of a just debt has been improperly withheld, and it seems to be fair and equitable that the party in default should make compensation by payment of interest, it is incumbent upon the Court to allow interest for such time and at such rate as the Court may think right.\nThis interpretation of the statute appears to me conclusive of the appeal. The Custodian presents a powerful argument to demonstrate that the liability was not for a sum certain, or payable by virtue of a written instrument at a time certain, and that there had been no demand in writing claiming interest from the date of the demand. This might have been effective if the claim were founded solely upon s. 35 of the Judicature Act, but the claimant, very judiciously I think, does not rely upon this section, and these considerations do not, in the circumstances of the case, make against the equity or fairness of an allowance of interest to compensate for the delay. When, on 1st June, 1921, the Railway Company registered the claimant as owner of the stock, and when it paid him the dividends accrued since October, 1917, it knew that he was equally entitled to the earlier dividends; that these amounted to 13,650 United States Dollars, and that the exchange, whatever the proper rate might be, was in favour of the United States. Moreover it ought to have been reasonably plain to the company that the claimant should have had the benefit of exchange, at least to the same extent as if the payments could have been made quarterly from time to time as the dividends were declared. Therefore I think that the fair and equitable character of the claim for interest is not, and cannot be, successfully assailed. Then, was the liability for payment of the $13,650 a just debt? That it was just is not in question. Ordinarily, when a company declares a dividend, a debt becomes payable to the shareholder in respect of his dividend for which he can sue at law. In re Severn & Wye & Severn Bridge Railway Co.[3]. The right of recovery was in suspense during the War, but the debt nevertheless existed; it was payable, it is true, in United States currency, but in Ehrensperger v. Anderson[4], it was held to be no objection to an action upon the common count for money had and received, that the money had been received in rupees and not in English currency. Parke B., said:\nUpon that objection, certainly, we consider that the plaintiff is not prevented from recovering. There are two authorities on the subject: one of these is a case of Harington v. Macmorris[5], in which an objection having been made, that the money received was foreign money, Lord Chief Justice Gibbs, then Mr. Justice Gibbs, treated that objection as having been exploded for thirty years. The real meaning of such a count is, that the defendant is indebted for money of such a value or amount in English money. However, the objection appears to have been listened to, perhaps more than it ought to have been, in a subsequent case of McLachlan v. Evans[6]; but the Court of Exchequer held that an action for money had and received for English money would not lie, unless there had been a reasonable time, after the receipt of the foreign money, to convert it into English. Possibly that case cannot be received as being very satisfactory; at all events, we do not decide this case against the plaintiff on this ground.\nApparently a similar view was entertained in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Hotels le Touquet Paris-Plage v. Cummings[7]. Obligations payable in foreign money which, if payable in English money, would constitute debts are spoken of in the books as debts payable in foreign money. There is essentially no difference between a debt payable in England and one payable in a foreign country, except that, when a debt payable in foreign currency is recovered in England, the foreign amount must be converted into English money, because the court has generally no jurisdiction to order payment in any other currency. I have not overlooked the fact that the claimant, by his pleading, claims to recover the premium of exchange as damages by reason of the failure of the Railway Company to deliver to him United States funds representing the nominal amount of the dividends withheld, and I am aware that a suggestion in support of the propriety of a claim for damages is to be found in the judgment of Vaughan Williams L.J., in Manners v. Pearson[8]; but I think the claim should be considered and effect given to the rights of the parties upon the facts admitted, and that, in the circumstances of this case and under the authorities which I have mentioned, the dividends constitute a debt within the meaning of the statute as interpreted. In substance there is a liquidated demand in money, and the withholding of payment is the cause of action. The form does not matter.\nI am therefore of the opinion that the interest is payable, and I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nUpon the cross-appeal the claimant contends that the proper date for conversion of the dividends from United States currency to Canadian currency was 1st June, 1921, when, in view of the state of war which had existed and the identification of his stock with the enemy, he first was entitled to claim them. And moreover he contends, by his factum, that, if the dates for conversion should be as found by the trial judge, the interest should run from those dates.\nAs to the time for conversion, I think the learned judge of the Exchequer Court was right in principle, and upon the authority of the decisions, which in England have been substantially uniform, that the rate is that which ruled at the time when each of the quarterly dividends became due or payable to the Custodian, who was the lawful recipient during the War. The dates which were set up in competition are 1st June, 1921, when, after the War was over, the claimant became entitled to receive the dividends, and 3rd March, 1924, when the Railway Company paid to the claimant $14,085.09, the amount then representing, in Canadian funds, the unpaid dividends. I see no reason, however, why the exchange should be computed as of a date depending upon the termination of the War and the diligence of the claimant in rectifying his title, nor why the claimant should derive any benefit from the fact that the Railway Company had failed to deposit these dividends; with the Custodian as required by the trading with the enemy regulations. If the War had not occurred, the dividends would have been paid to the Nationalbank fur Deutchsland from time to time as they were declared and became payable. Neither the Company nor the Custodian is answerable for the legal delay in payment which was brought about by the War, although that is a condition with which the parties have to reckon. If there had been no war, the authorities are conclusive that, if payment were claimed in Canadian money, the conversion should be made as at the time when the obligation to pay in foreign currency was incurred, that is, the respective dates when the dividends were declared to be payable. See the following cases: Cockerell v. Barber[9]; Scott v. Bevan[10]; Bertram v. Duhamel[11]; Manners v. Pearson[12]; Di Ferdinando v. Simon, Smits & Co. Ltd.[13]; SS. Celia v. SS. Volturno[14]; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des H\u00f4tels le Touquet Paris-Plage v. Cummings[15]; In re British-American Continental Bank, Lim., Goldzieher and Penso\u2019s claim, also Liegeois\u2019 claim[16]; Peyrae v. Wilkinson[17].\nThe claimant, in effect, now seeks, in this action, the conversion of the debt into Canadian funds. The rate and times of payment of the dividends were regulated by the Railway Company when they were declared. Is there then a different rule because, at the time fixed for payment, the right was suspended by reason of the War? I say no. The obligation remained; it was by reason of the original obligation that payment was exigible, and, although the exercise of the right of conversion was, by the law, postponed, the right, when it became exercisable, had reference to the original subject-matter, and remained the same. It results only in confusion to think of the time for conversion as shifting according to contingent or uncertain events, or the election of the claimant as to when he would establish his title.\nThe claimant\u2019s contention that interest should be reckoned from the respective dates when the dividends were declared cannot succeed, because these were not contractually interest bearing debts, and the withholding of the dividends during the War was lawful, and therefore is not to be visited by damages.\nThe cross-appeal should therefore be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal and Cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wilkie & Hamilton.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bain, Bicknell, White & Gordon.\nOn the 30th May, 1927, an application was made to the Court, on behalf of the Custodian, for a re-hearing of the above appeal, on the ground that the laws applicable to the issues raised upon the appeal of the Custodian were the laws of the province of Quebec, whereas the appeal had been submitted to the Court as if the laws of Ontario were the only laws applicable. The application was refused, the Court stating that the case was not one in which a rehearing should be granted; it would be establishing a very dangerous precedent, to grant a re-hearing because of a point overlooked in argument; that was really all that the motion came to; that it was satisfied, from counsel\u2019s statement, that other cases would not be affected, as the point desired to be raised on the re-hearing applied for was still open to be raised in other cases; other cases would be affected only on such points as the judgment of this Court had directly decided.\n[1] [1926] Ex.

Plaintiff transferred land (including mines and minerals; except coal, which was reserved from his title) to the Soldier Settlement Board, which sold it to defendant. Plaintiff claimed against defendant an undivided one-half interest in the mines and minerals (except coal) in the land, under an alleged oral agreement with defendant, which, he alleged, was subsequently confirmed and acknowledged in writing. This writing was a power of attorney (prepared by plaintiff's solicitor on plaintiff's instructions) whereby defendant on his account authorized plaintiff \"to * * * dispose of my undivided one-half interest (the other undivided one-half interest belonging to the said [plaintiff]) in the mines and minerals, including petroleum and natural gas\" in said land. Defendant, a man of little education, said he understood that the parenthetical clause referred to plaintiff's interest in another parcel of land, and that the project authorized by the power of attorney was the sale by plaintiff of the oil rights in both parcels together, the one belonging to defendant and the other to plaintiff, and defendant denied any agreement such as plaintiff alleged. Plaintiff, in the alternative, claimed that defendant should be deemed to hold in trust for his benefit an undivided one-half interest in the mines and minerals.\nHeld, plaintiff could not succeed on his alleged contract, as there was no consideration, and s. 4 of the Statute of Frauds was not complied with; the words in parenthesis in the power of attorney did not constitute a sufficient memorandum or note within s. 4; nor did said words operate as a declaration of trust; moreover, s. 7 of the Statute of Frauds was not complied with.\nMere words of confirmation or acknowledgment cannot make a valid contract of that which is ineffective as a contract for lack of consideration, and an incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appear that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely to make a transfer (Heartley v. Nicholson, L.R. 19 Eq. 233, Richards v. Delbridge, L.R. 18 Eq. 11, at p. 15, and other cases, cited).\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Alta. (22 Alta. L.R. 281), affirmed. APPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1] allowing the defendant L'Hirondelle's appeal from the judgment of Simmons C.J. [2]in which he adjudged that the defendant L'Hirondelle should account to the plaintiff for a portion of the purchase money payable by one Herron under Herron's contract of purchase of certain land, the portion to be accounted for representing a one-half interest in the mines and minerals in and under the south-west quarter of section 17, township 20, range 2, west of the 5th meridian. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The plaintiff's appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nW. F. O'Connor K.C. for the appellant.\nH. P. O. Savary K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The plaintiff was the owner of three parcels of land in Alberta, first, the S.W. \u00bc of section 17, township 20, range 2, west of the 5th Meridian, including the minerals therein; secondly, the S.E. \u00bc of section 18 in the same township and range, but without the minerals; thirdly, 240 acres in section 8 immediately to the south of the first parcel above described, including the minerals. The property was subject to a mortgage in favour of the Associated Investors of Rochester, N.Y., for $4,500, upon which there was due $4,751.60, and there were also unpaid taxes. The controversy is with regard to the first parcel. The mortgage company was pressing for payment, and the plaintiff approached the defendant, who was a neighbour and connected with him by marriage, and suggested that he should acquire the first and second parcels through the Soldier Settlement Board, which had been recently constituted and was exercising the powers conferred by the Soldier Settlement Act , ch. 71 of the Dominion, 1919. The defendant made application to the Board for the purchase and secured an agreement, dated 24th December, 1920, whereby the Board agreed to sell these two parcels to the defendant, under the provisions of the Act, and according to the stipulations of the agreement, subject to the reservations, limitations and conditions contained in the original grant from the Crown, for the sum of $5,000 to be paid, $500 down, and the balance in 25 equal, consecutive, annual instalments of $319.30 each, consisting of principal and interest calculated annually at 5%. In the meantime the Board had negotiated with the plaintiff for the acquisition of the title, and had advanced to the plaintiff's solicitor the amount necessary to discharge the mortgage and taxes, and, on 18th January, 1921, the plaintiff executed a transfer of the land to the Board for the consideration of $5,000, the receipt of which was thereby acknowledged. At the same time the plaintiff, through his solicitors, informed the district office of the Board that he wished to reserve for himself the oil and mineral rights, but the answer was that the district superintendent had no authority under the Board's regulations to accept title from a vendor subject to any personal reservations, and that, if Mr. McPherson wished to retain the oil and minerals, it would be necessary to submit the case to the head office for consideration in a formal manner. The plaintiff did not pursue the matter with the head office, and his transfer expressly included the mines and minerals in the S.W. \u00bc of s. 17, and the right to work the same, except the coal, which, according to his title, belonged to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. It would seem that the defendant entered into and remained in possession under his agreement until 2nd March, 1926, when, by the consent of the Board, he made an agreement with Wm. Stewart Herron, whereby he assigned all his right, title and interest in the land, and the benefit of all covenants, terms and conditions contained in his agreement with the Board, for the price or sum of $20,800, to be paid, with interest, in the manner and at the time stipulated by the agreement. Then, on 3rd March, 1926, the plaintiff registered with the registrar of the Southern Alberta Land Registration District a caveat in which he stated that he claimed:\nan undivided one-half interest in mines and minerals, including petroleum and natural gas (excepting coal reserved to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company) in and under the South-west Quarter of Section Seventeen (17), Township Twenty (20), Range Two (2), West of the Fifth (5th) Meridian in the Province of Alberta, containing one hundred and sixty (160) acres more or less, under and by virtue of an agreement with JOHN L'HIRONDELLE, of near Black Diamond Post Office in the Province of Alberta, farmer, whereby I was to become the owner of an undivided one-half interest of the said mines and minerals in and under the said land, which said agreement was confirmed and acknowledged by the said John L'Hirondelle by an instrument in writing dated the 24th day of February, 1926, the said John L'Hirondelle claiming interest in the said mines and minerals in and under the said lands under an agreement with The Soldier Settlement Board of Canada, which agreement included the purchase by the said John L'Hirondelle of the mines and minerals (excepting coal reserved to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company) in and under the said land, standing in the register in the name of The Soldier Settlement Board of Canada.\nWith the caveat was filed the plaintiff's affidavit, in which he stated that he had a good and valid claim upon the land.\nThe defendant then caused notice to be served upon the plaintiff, requiring him, under the provisions of the Land Titles Act, to take proceedings to verify his caveat, and thereupon the plaintiff commenced this action, in which the statement of claim was filed on 16th March, 1926.\nBy the statement of claim, the plaintiff alleged that:\nBy an agreement made between the Defendant John L'Hirondelle and the Plaintiff herein the said Defendant agreed to transfer and convey to the Plaintiff an undivided one-half interest in the mines and minerals in and under the said lands including petroleum and natural gas and excepting coal, which said agreement was confirmed and acknowledged by the said Defendant by an instrument in writing dated the 24th day of February, 1926.\nAfter the evidence had been taken at the trial, the plaintiff amended by adding another paragraph, in which he alleged in the alternative that, by an instrument in writing of 24th February, 1926,. the defendant made a declaration that he was the owner of an undivided one-half interest in the mines and minerals, and that the other undivided one-half interest was the property of the plaintiff. The plaintiff had claimed, by his original pleading, a declaration that he had an undivided one-half interest in the mines and minerals as against the defendant, and that the registered caveat should be continued. By his amended pleading, he claimed in the alternative a declaration that the defendant should be deemed to hold in trust for his use and benefit \"an undivided one-half interest in whatever right, title or interest may be hereafter acquired by the said defendant in the mines and minerals,\" and that the defendant should be deemed to hold in trust for the plaintiff an undivided one-half interest in the money or other consideration received by the defendant on account of any sale of the mines and minerals. The plaintiff was ordered to give particulars, and in response stated that the agreement referred to in the 4th paragraph of the statement of claim was an oral agreement entered into during or about the months of December, 1920, and January, 1921, and that it was afterwards confirmed by an instrument in writing of 24th February, 1926, and he stated the consideration for the agreement to be:\nmoney advanced by the Plaintiff to the said Defendant, and the promise of money afterwards advanced to the said Defendant, and the allowing of the said Defendant by the Plaintiff to forthwith occupy and live on the Plaintiff's farm adjoining the land hereinbefore mentioned, and further, the arranging for the sale, and the sale by the Plaintiff, of the South-west quarter of Section Seventeen (17) in Township Twenty (20) Range Two (2) West of the Fifth Meridian in the Province of Alberta, so as to enable the said Defendant to purchase the said land and against which the caveat mentioned in the Statement of Claim was filed.\nThe defendant, by his defence, denied the alleged agreement, and he moreover alleged that there was no consideration for it, and that there was no memorandum of it to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.\nThe action was tried before Simmons C.J., of the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, on 19th May, 1926. The two witnesses upon the disputed facts were the plaintiff and the defendant; the former testified that, after he had transferred to the Board, the defendant told him that they would hold the mineral rights together \"fifty-fifty\"; and, in another place, that they would have the oil rights together. He admits that the agreement was oral, but he produced, by way of corroboration, a power of attorney from the defendant to himself, dated 24th February, 1926, which is the instrument referred to in his pleadings, by which the constituent appoints the plaintiff\nfor me and in my name, place and stead and for my sole use and benefit to sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of my undivided one-half interest (the other undivided one-half interest belonging to the said Addison McPherson) in the mines and minerals, including petroleum and natural gas, in and under the south-west quarter of Section Seventeen (17) in Township Twenty (20), Range Two (2), West of the Fifth Meridian in the Province of Alberta.\nThe power of attorney was prepared by the plaintiff's solicitor under his instructions in the defendant's absence and without his knowledge, but the defendant signed it after it had been read and explained to him by the solicitor. The defendant who is a half-breed with very little educa- tion, says, however, that he understood the clause in parenthesis to refer to the plaintiff's interest in the 240 acres which the plaintiff had retained, and that the project which he thought he was authorizing by the power of attorney was the sale by the plaintiff of the oil rights in both parcels together, the one belonging to the defendant and the other to the plaintiff. The plaintiff does not deny that such a sale was in contemplation or had been discussed, and there is a memorandum in evidence, prepared by him, and which was used on the day the power of attorney was signed, when he persuaded the defendant to sign it, in which the plaintiff figures the value of his 240 acres at $2,500 per acre; and suggests particulars for an agreement of sale. The defendant denies that he ever promised the plaintiff any interest in the minerals, and it is, I think, a reasonable inference from the evidence that the plaintiff was using the defendant, who was a returned soldier, in order to effect a sale of the two quarter-sections to the Board, so as to save the 240 acres which he retained, and which were also covered by the mortgage to the Associated Mortgage Investors Company. The defendant testifies that it was not until after he had sold to Herron that he knew or learned that the plaintiff claimed an interest in the minerals. No proof was adduced of the considerations for the agreement alleged by the plaintiff's particulars.\nThe learned Chief Justice expresses his finding [3] in the following language:\nUpon the controversial aspects of the case as between the plaintiff and the defendant L'Hirondelle, I am satisfied that the oral agreement alleged by the plaintiff was made by the defendant, and that the document executed on February 24, 1926, takes the same out of the Statute of Frauds which is pleaded in evidence against the plaintiff, but although the plaintiff alleges certain considerations passing I am satisfied no such consideration passed and that there was no consideration for the declaration of trust.\nAnd his conclusion [4] is that:\nIt would appear that the defendant, L'Hirondelle, has an interest in the purchase moneys accruing due to the Board under the Herron purchase and the plaintiff is apparently entitled to a declaration that the defendant, L'Hirondelle, should account to him for a portion of said purchase money representing one-half interest in the mines and minerals which passed under the plaintiff's transfer, to the Board. The defendant appealed, and the Appellate Division [5] found in effect that there was no agreement between the parties respecting the minerals, no consideration for any such agreement, no completed gift, and no evidence of intention to declare a trust; the learned judges, five of them, were unanimous in allowing the appeal.\nNow it will be perceived from the foregoing narrative that the plaintiff, who is now the appellant, launched his case upon an oral agreement to transfer and convey an undivided half-interest in the mines and minerals. That is what he averred and deposed to by his caveat, and what he alleged in his statement of claim and particulars. It is obvious that the claim so stated cannot succeed, because the contract which was pleaded was without consideration according to the evidence and the concurrent findings, and moreover because the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds was not complied with. The words in the brackets of the power of attorney, \"(the other undivided one-half interest belonging to the said Addison McPherson),\" do not set out the names of the parties, the terms, or the consideration of the contract; nor indeed do they suggest the existence of any contract, and they in no wise constitute a sufficient memorandum or note of a contract within the meaning of the section. The learned Chief Justice seems, however, to regard these words as expressing a declaration of trust, although, according to the caveat and the statement of claim, they were intended to confirm or acknowledge the alleged agreement for the transfer of an undivided one-half interest in the minerals. The clause evidently must have been introduced for a purpose which is not made clear on the face of the instrument, and, seeing that the power of attorney was written for the plaintiff and under his instructions, it is, I think, fair and probably not far from the truth to admit the motive and intention which he attributes to it; at all events the plaintiff cannot complain if his allegations be accepted. But mere words of confirmation or acknowledgment cannot make a valid contract of that which is ineffective as a contract for lack of consideration, and an incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appear that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely to make a transfer. Heartley v. Nicholson (1); Lee v. Magrath (2); also the judgment of Parker J., in In re Innes (3). Moreover,\nIf it (the settlement) is intended to take effect by transfer, the Court will not hold the intended transfer to operate as a declaration of trust, for then every imperfect instrument could be made effectual by being converted into a perfect trust.\nRichards v. Delbridge (4), a decision of Jessel M.R., following Milroy v. Lord (5). The clause in question is not evidence of an intention to declare a trust; it is, by interpretation, more apt as matter of description, or perhaps to acknowledge a title by some means already vested, and it contains no word or accent pointing to the assumption by the defendant of the duties, obligations or character of a trustee. Moreover, of course, as said by the Appellate Division, there is no compliance with the 7th section of the Statute of Frauds. The appellant's case is thus confronted with insurmountable difficulties and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 22 Alta.

Of no ordinary child over seven years of age can it be safely predicated, from his mere appearance, that he does not understand the nature of an oath. A very brief inquiry may suffice to satisfy the judge on the point But some inquiry is indispensable.\nThe Court (reversing judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia [1927] 2 W.W.R. 265) quashed a conviction for murder and granted a new trial, on the ground that the unsworn testimony of a child ten years old was improperly received (Allen v. The King 44 Can. S.C.R. 331 cited), there being no material before the judge on which he could properly base an opinion that the child did not understand the nature of an oath.\nQuestioning of an accused by police, if properly conducted and after warning duly given, will not per se render the accused's statement inadmissible. But the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the court that anything in the nature of a confession or statement procured from accused while under arrest was voluntary, always rests with the Crown (The King v. Bellos, [1927] S.C.R. 258; Prosko v. The King, 63 Can. S.C.R. 226). That burden can rarely, if ever, be discharged merely by proof that the giving of the statement was preceded by the customary warning and an expression of opinion on oath by the police officer who obtained it, that it was made freely and voluntarily; what took place in the process by which the statement was ultimately obtained should be fully disclosed; and, with all the facts before him, the judge should form his own opinion that the tendered statement was indeed free and voluntary, before admitting it in evidence.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[1] sustaining, by a majority, the conviction of the appellant, on his trial before D. A. McDonald J. and a jury, on a charge of murder. The grounds of appeal, and the material facts of the case bearing on the points dealt with by this Court, are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed; the conviction was quashed, and a new trial ordered.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and J. Edward Bird for the appellant.\nJ. A. Ritchie K.C. and A. M. Johnson K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The defendant appeals to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia dismissing his appeal from a conviction for murder. The opinion of the majority of the court (Macdonald C.J.A., Galliher and Macdonald JJ.A.) was delivered by the Chief Justice. A direction given by the court, pursuant to ss. 5 of s. 1013 of the Criminal Code, allowing the delivery of separate judgments, is embodied in the formal judgment dismissing the appeal. Dissenting opinions were accordingly delivered by Martin and McPhillips JJ.A., who would have directed a new trial.\nFive distinct grounds of appeal, based on the judgment of McPhillips J.A., were taken by the appellant:\n1. Insufficiency of the evidence to warrant a conviction;\n2. Mis-direction of the jury by the learned trial judge;\n3. Rejection by the Court of Appeal of a motion by the defendant for the reception of further evidence;\n4. Wrongful admission of the unsworn testimony of Haldis Sandahl, a child aged ten years;\n5. Wrongful admission of a statement procured by the police from the accused while under arrest, because its voluntary character had not been established.\nMr. Justice Martin's dissent rests solely on the ground last mentioned.\nWhen the child, Sandahl, was called as a witness the record shews what occurred as follows:\nHALDIS SANDAHL, a witness called on behalf of the Crown, testified as follows:\nMr. JOHNSON: I think that if you put her in a chair in the box; we haven't a high chair. This child, my lord, is of tender years, nine years old and I tender her evidence under the provisions of section 16 of the Canada Evidence Act.\nMr. PATMORE: I understand that this is because this child does not understand the nature of an oath.\nMr. JOHNSON: That is for the judge to satisfy himself.\nThe COURT: Q. Where do you live, Haldis?\u2014A. Port Essington.\nQ. See how loudly you can speak. How old are you?\u2014A. Eight\u2014ten.\nQ. And what is your daddy's name?\u2014A. Mr. Sandahi.\nQ. What does he do, does he live up there?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And your mother, does she live with you too?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You go to school?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Can you read a little bit?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And write your own name?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Do you know that it is very bad for little girls to tell lies?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Did they tell you that little girls must never tell stories? Do you understand that?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You must always tell the truth?\u2014A. Yes. Q. We want you to answer the questions these men ask you and be sure to tell the truth.\nThe witness then proceeded to give unsworn testimony, which covered ground as to identification most vital to the interest of the defendant.\nS. 16 of the Canada Evidence Act reads as follows:\n16. In any legal proceeding where a child of tender years is offered as a witness, and such child does not, in the opinion of the judge, justice, or other presiding officer, understand the nature of an oath, the evidence of such child may be received, though not given on oath, if, in the opinion of the judge, justice, or other presiding officer, as the case may be, such child is possessed of sufficient intelligence to ju<?> the reception of the evidence, and understands the duty of speaking the truth.\n2. No case shall be decided upon such evidence alone, and such evidence must be corroborated by some other material evidence.\nThe only light thrown by the record on the view taken by the learned trial judge as to the scope of his function in regard to determining whether the girl, Sandahl, understood the nature of an oath is found in his charge to the jury when he said:\nThe little girl Haldis Sandahl, she was ten years old last February, and as you noticed when the question came up the law provides that if a child is called as a witness in any case, if the judge thinks the child is not old enough to understand the nature of an oath she can give evidence. Then when it is given, that evidence has exactly the same weight as any other evidence, subject to this, and then provides that on that evidence alone you must have other evidence with it. ***\nThe learned judge made no inquiry as to the capacity or education of the girl in regard to her comprehension of the meaning, effect and sanction of an oath, presumably because, from her appearance, he thought her \"not old enough to understand the nature of an oath.\" She was tendered by the Crown as a witness whose evidence could be received under s. 16 of the Canada Evidence Act; and, apparently because no objection was taken by counsel for the prisoner, she was allowed to give her evidence unsworn, the learned trial judge having first satisfied himself by apt questions that \" she (was) possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of her evidence and (understood) the duty of speaking the truth.\"\nNow it is quite as much the duty of the presiding judge to ascertain by appropriate methods whether or not a child offered as a witness does, or does not, understand the nature of an oath, as it is to satisfy himself of the intelligence of such child and his appreciation of the duty of speaking the truth. On both points alike he is required by the statute to form an opinion; as to both he is entrusted with discretion, to be exercised judicially and upon reasonable grounds. The term \"child of tender years\" is not defined. Of no ordinary child over seven years of age can it be safely predicated, from his mere appearance, that he does not understand the nature of an oath. Such a child may be convicted of crime. Crim. Code, sections 17-18. A very brief inquiry may suffice to satisfy the judge on this point. But some inquiry would seem to be indispensable. The opinion of the judge, so formed, that the child does not understand the nature of an oath is made by the statute a pre-requisite to the reception in evidence of his unsworn testimony. With the utmost respect, in our opinion there was, in this instance, no material before the judge on which he could properly base such an opinion. He apparently misconceived the duty in this regard imposed upon him by the statute.\nThe unsworn testimony of Haldis Sandahl was, we think, improperly received. Its importance is not questioned. It may well have been the deciding factor which led the jury to the conclusion that identification of the defendant as the person guilty of the murder in question was sufficiently established. The case falls clearly within the decision of this Court in Allen v. The King[2].\nThe conviction must, therefore, be quashed and a new trial ordered.\nWe feel, however, that we should not part from this case without expressing our view that the proof of the voluntary character of the accused's statement to the police, which was put in evidence against him, is most unsatisfactory. That statement, put in writing by the police officer, was obtained only upon a fourth questioning to which the accused was subjected on the day following his arrest. Three previous attempts to lead him to \"talk\" had apparently proved abortive\u2014why, we are left to surmise. The accused, a young Indian, could neither read nor write. No particulars are vouchsafed as to what transpired at any of the three previous \"interviews\"; and but meagre details are given of the process by which the written statement ultimately signed by the appellant was obtained. We think that the police officer who obtained that statement should have fully disclosed all that took place on each of the occasions when he \"interviewed\" the prisoner; and, if another policeman was present, as the defendant swore at the trial, his evidence should have been adduced before the statement was received in evidence. With all the facts before him, the learned judge should form his own opinion that the tendered statement was indeed free and voluntary as the basis for its admission, rather than accept the mere opinion of the police officer, who had obtained it, that it was made \" voluntarily and freely.\"\nIt should always be borne in mind that while, on the one hand, questioning of the accused by the police, if properly conducted and after warning duly given, will not per se render his statement inadmissible, on the other hand, the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the court that anything in the nature of a confession or statement procured from the accused while under arrest was voluntary always rests with the Crown. The King v. Bellos[3] ; Prosko v. The King[4]. That burden can rarely, if ever, be discharged merely by proof that the giving of the statement was preceded by the customary warning and an expression of opinion on oath by the police officer, who obtained it, that it was made freely and voluntarily.\nThe place at which the next trial shall be held is in the discretion of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, to which, if so advised, the accused may make application for a change of venue.\nAppeal allowed, and new trial ordered.\n[1] [1927] 2 W.W.R. 265.\n[2] (1911) 44 Can.

Code, s. 1002 (as amended, 1925, c. 38, s. 26)\u2014Nature of evidence required for corroboration\u2014Charge of offence, under Cr. Code, s. 301, of carnally knowing girl under 14 years of age.\nThe corroboration required by s. 1002 of the Criminal Code (as amended 1925, c. 38, s. 26) must be by evidence independent of the complainant, and it must tend to show that the accused committed the crime charged (R. v. Baskerville, [1916] 2 K.B. 658). The question whether there is any evidence within that description, on which a jury could find corroboration, is one of law; although, whether corroborative inferences should be drawn is a question for the jury (R. v. Gray, 68 J.P. 327).\nOn a charge of carnally knowing a girl under 14 years of age, under s. 301 of the Criminal Code, it was held (reversing judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, 36 Man. R. 373) that the identification, by its plate number and a certain cushion, by the girl, of accused\u2019s motor car as the one driven at the time of the offence by the person committing it, was not, in a proper sense, independent evidence tending to connect accused with the crime, and therefore did not fulfil the requirement as to corroboration of the girl\u2019s evidence that accused committed the offence. But the Court was of opinion that, while the evidence was not explicit that accused maintained silence when charged with the crime on his arrest, and again when confronted with and identified by the girl, his conduct on those occasions, so far as disclosed, and in subsequently voluntarily making two inconsistent statements, was such that a jury, or a judge trying the case without a jury, might infer from it some acknowledgment of guilt; whether such inferences should be drawn was a question of fact; (R. v. Christie [1914] A.C. 545, at pp. 554, 559-560, 563-564, 565-566; Mash v. Barley [1914] 3 K.B. 1226, at pp. 1230-1231, 1234; R, v. Feigenbaum [1919] 1 K.B. 431, at pp. 433-434, cited); ha such conduct of used been found by the trial judge to be corroborative of the girl\u2019s story the conviction could not have been set aside: but there being no finding by the trial judge as to the inference to be drawn from such conduct of accused, nor any adjudication that it afforded the requisite corroboration, this Court could not, without usurping the exclusive function of the tribunal of fact, make such an adjudication; the trial judge\u2019s ruling that accused\u2019s admission of ownership of the car and its identification by the girl constituted corroborative evidence, was erroneous, and resulted in a mistrial; the case did not fall within the saving operation of s. 1014 (2) (as enacted 1923, c. 41) of the Criminal Code, and the conviction should be set aside; but the Court, in the exercise of its discretion under s. 1014 (3), refused to direct accused\u2019s discharge, and ordered a hew trial. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] affirming, by a majority, the conviction of the appellant by His Honour Judge Stacpoole, in the County Court Judge\u2019s Criminal Court, for the offence of carnally knowing a girl under the age of 14 years, contrary to s. 301 of the Criminal Code.\nThe complainant, the victim of the alleged offence, stated in her evidence that, as she was on her way to the post office at Lockport, the accused overtook her in a motor car, and offered to take her to her destination, that she got in the car, that accused took her out of her way and committed the offence on a road; that after the offence was committed and as the accused was leaving her, she made a note of the plate number of the car. She subsequently picked out the car, recognizing it, according to her evidence, by its plate number and by a certain cushion on the seat. Evidence from other sources was given to show that this, car belonged to the accused. The complainant also picked out the accused, as the one who had committed the offence, from a line of five men in the police office. After the complainant had picked him out and left the office, the accused made a statement to the police, which he immediately afterwards corrected by another statement, to show his movements on the day the alleged offence was committed. He admitted he owned a car with a plate number the same as that alleged by the complainant, and that he was driving it on the day in question, but at Winnipeg, which is nearly twenty miles from Lockport.\nThe question before the court on this appeal was whether or not there was evidence upon which corroboration of the complainant\u2019s evidence, as required by s. 1002 of the Criminal Code, as amended 1925, c. 38, s. 26, could properly be found.\nJ. M. Isaacs for the appellant.\nR. W. Craig K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nAniglin C.J.C.\u2014The appellant was convicted\u2019, on the 7th of March, 1927, in the County Court Judge\u2019s Criminal Court, at Winnipeg, of an offence under s. 301 of the Crim- inal Code, on appeal, based on the grounds, (a) of noncorroboration of the evidence of the complainant, and (b) of absence of proof that the complainant was not the wife of the appellant, his conviction was affirmed by the Manitoba Court of Appeal, unanimously as to ground (6), and with Prendergast and Fullerton JJ.A. dissenting as to ground (a). These learned judges were of the opinion that there was no evidence upon which the corroboration required by s. 1002 of the Criminal Code, as amended by s. 26 of c. 38 of the statutes of 1925, could be found:\n1002. No person accused of an offence, etc., shall be convicted upon the evidence of one witness unless such witness is corroborated in some material particular by evidence implicating the accused.\nSince the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R. v. Baskerville[2], the requirements of the provision now found in s. 1002 admit of no doubt. The corroboration must be by evidence independent of the complainant; and it\nmust tend to show that the accused committed the crime charged.\nThe question we have to pass upon is whether the record before us contains any evidence within that description, on which a jury could find corroboration, Prendergast and Fullerton JJ.A., resting their dissent on the proposition that such evidence is entirely lacking. That question we regard as a question of law, although, no doubt, whether corroborative inferences should be drawn is a question for the jury. R. v. Gray[3]; S. 1024, Crim. Code, as enasted by s. 27 of c. 38 of the statutes of 1925.\nOf most of the matters relied upon by the Crown as implicating the accused, however, it cannot, in our opinion, be safely predicated that they are in evidence independently of the testimony and conduct of the complainant, or that, without her testimony, they \u201ctend to show that the accused committed the crime charged.\u201d This defect affects everything in connection with the alleged implication of the accused because of the admission by him of the ownership and driving, on the morning in question, of the car identified by the complainant as that in which she was taken to the scene of the crime. While the verification of the details given by her no doubt adds to the credibility of the story she tells, everything in that connection, including the admitted facte of ownership and driving (not at or near the scene of the offence, but in and about Winnipeg) depends, for its evidentiary value, upon her statement that a certain license number was that carried by the car in which she was conveyed to the scene of the crime and her subsequent identification of a cushion found in the car bearing that number. This is not, in a proper sense, independent evidence tending to connect the accused with the crime. In themselves these facte and circumstances merely \u201crelate to the identity of the accused without connecting him with the crime.\u201d R. v. Baskerville[4]. They implicate the accused solely by reason of the complainant\u2019s statement as to the number of the car and her identification of the cushion in it. Without this additional factor they are quite irrelevant. Nor can any multiplication of such facts amount to corroboration. Thomas v. Jones[5]. They are all admissible only by reason of the girl\u2019s own story connecting them with the crime. They lack, therefore, the essential quality of independence.\nBut there are in evidence certain other matters which, according to the view to be taken of, and the inferences to be drawn from, them by the tribunal of fact, may meet the requirements of s. 1002 of the Criminal Code.\nWhen the accused was first charged with the offence by the constable who arrested him, so far as the record discloses he made no reply to the charge which was read to him; again, when, at the police station, he was identified by the complainant, who, going up to him, said: \u201cThat is the man,\u201d so far as the evidence shows, he made no denial in her presence. But, almost immediately after she had gone away, he asked to make, and made, a voluntary statement of his movements on the morning of the 20th of July, when the crime is charged to have been committed. Scarcely had that statement been signed by him when he said he had made a mistake and dictated a second statement which he also signed. The manifest object of these two statements was to show that during the material time he was in and about the city of Winnipeg, 20 miles distant from Lockport near which the crime was committed. Of these two statements the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba says:\nThe first statement was to the effect that he, the accused, was driving his car in Winnipeg and conversing with various persons there at about the same time that the girl says he overtook her on the road to Lockport, which is twenty miles away, and induced her to enter his car. In the second statement, made immediately after the first, he gave a completely different account as to his movements on the day in question: He says he went in his car to his mother\u2019s place in St. Boniface and stayed there until 10.30, when he went to his sister\u2019s place in the same city and she came back with him to his mother\u2019s; that he stayed there about fifteen minutes and then went home, arriving there about noon.\nThese statements were clearly made for the purpose of founding an alibi upon them. Probably, after he had made the first statement, he feared that the persons he mentioned as in conversation with him that forenoon might not support his statements. It would seem, therefore, that he made the second statement in the expectation that his mother and sister would assist him. However, no evidence for the defence was put in.\nMr. Justice Trueman, with whom Mr. Justice Dennistoun concurred, says:\nThese statements carry nothing but conviction that they are a tissue of lies. Each completely contradicts and refutes the other. It is not necessary to examine or compare them in detail. In the first statement there is no mention of visits to his mother and sister, to whom, with his wife, the proof of the alibi is left by the second statement. That both statements are false I have no doubt. That one is assuredly false need alone be stated.\nWhile the evidence is not explicit that the appellant maintained silence when charged with the crime on his arrest and again when confronted with and identified by the complainant, his conduct on those occasions, so far as disclosed, and in voluntarily making the two inconsistent statements referred to, was such that a jury might\u2014and in this case that the trial judge might\u2014infer from it some acknowledgment of guilt. Whether such inferences should be drawn is a question of fact.\nAs put by Lord Atkinson, in R. v. Christie[6]\u2014where there was a question of the admissibility of evidence of a statement made by the complainant (a boy of 5, who testified without being sworn) in the presence of the accused, who was charged with indecent assault\u2014\nAs to the second ground, the rule of law undoubtedly is that a statement made in the presence of an accused person, even upon an occasion which should be expected reasonably to call for some explanation or denial from him, is not evidence against him of the facts stated, save so far as he accepts the statement, so as to make it, in effect, his own. If he accepts the statement in part only, then to that extent alone does it become his statement. He may accept the statement by word or conduct, action or demeanour, and it is the function of the jury which tries the case to determine whether his words, action, conduct, or demeanour at the time when a statement was made amounts to an acceptance of it in whole or in part. It by no means follows, I think, that a mere denial by the accused of the facts mentioned in the statement necessarily renders the statement inadmissible, because he may deny the statement in such a manner and under such circumstances as may lead a jury to disbelieve him, and constitute evidence from which an acknowledgment may be inferred by them.\nLord Moulton, in the same case, at pp. 559-560, said:\nIt is common ground that, if on such an occasion he admits it, evidence can be given of the admission and of what passed on the occasion when it was made. It seems quite illogical that it should be admissible to prove that the accused was charged with the crime if his answer thereto was an admission, while it is not admissible to prove it when his answer has been a denial of the crime, and I cannot agree that the admissibility or non-admissibility is decided as a matter of law by any such artificial rule. Going back to first principles as enunciated above, the deciding question is whether the evidence of the whole occurrence is relevant or not. If the prisoner admits the charge the evidence is obviously relevant. * * * The evidential value of the occurrence depends entirely on the behaviour of the prisoner, for the fact that some one\u2019 makes a statement to him subsequently to the commission of the crime cannot in itself have any value as evidence for or against him. The only evidence for or against him is his behaviour in response to the charge, but I can see no justification for laying down as a rule of law that any particular form of response, whether of a positive or negative character, is such that it cannot in some circumstances have an evidential value. I am, therefore, of opinion that there is no rule of law that evidence cannot be given of the accused being charged with the offence and of his behaviour on hearing such charge where that behaviour amounts to a denial of his guilt.\nLord Reading, at pp. 563-4, said:\nAs to the second ground. A statement made in the presence of one of the parties to a civil action may be given in evidence against him if it is relevant to any of the matters in issue. And equally such a statement made in the presence of the accused may be given in evidence against him at his trial.\nAnd he added, at pp. 565-6:\nIt might well be that the prosecution wished to give evidence of such a statement in order to prove the conduct and demeanour of the accused when hearing the statement as a relevant fact in the particular case, notwithstanding that it did not amount either to an acknowledgment or some evidence of an acknowledgment of any part of the truth of the statement. I think it impossible to lay down any general rule to be applied to all such cases, save the principle of strict law to which I have referred. Mash v. Darley[7], was a case of bastardy. The defendant had already been convicted of having had unlawful carnal knowledge of the complainant. On his preliminary hearing preceding that conviction he had deposed that the complainant was a fast girl and that that was the cause of her condition. On his trial no such suggestion was made. The question was whether proof of these facts could afford corroboration of the complainant\u2019s story in the bastardy case. Buckley L.J., said, at pp. 1230-1:\nThere are two matters, it seems to me, which are plainly admissible evidence. The first is that the superintendent of police said that he was present at the inquiry before the justices when the appellant gave evidence which suggested that the respondent was a fast girl and that that was the reason of her condition. That is admissible. The second is that the superintendent of police was in Court during the trial at the assizes and he says that no suggestion was then made by the appellant that the respondent was a fast girl, nor did the appellant repeat the evidence on this point, which he gave at the hearing of the charge before the justices in August, 1912. That is admissible. Corroborative evidence, I conceive, may be found either in admissions by the man or inferences properly drawn from the conduct of the man. Admission here, there is none. Conduct there is. Were or were not the justices entitled to take into account as a matter of evidence upon which they might come to some conclusion the fact that the man before\u2019 the justices told a story, namely, that she was fast and that her condition was due to that state of things, and the fact that when at the assizes he stood in peril and when, if the defence was true, it was to his interest to set it forward, he did not set it forward at all? It has been argued before us as if he could not have set up that defence without going into the box and exposing himself to cross-examination. It appears to me that\u2019 that is a mistake. The defence could have been set up in cross-examination of the girl when she was in the box. Nothing of the kind was done. So, upon matters which are admissible in evidence, it is established that the conduct of the man was this\u2014that before the justices he took a particular course and at a subsequent date he did not take a particular course, and that that was a course which you would have expected him to take under circumstances of his innocence. It is not for us to say what weight ought to be given to that evidence. All that we have to look at is to see whether there was evidence. If there was evidence, it is not for us but for the justices to determine whether or not that was evidence which satisfied them. It appears to me that that was corroborative evidence and that the justices were entitled to take into account that the man so conducted himself as that there was reason from his conduct to infer that the girl\u2019s story was presumably true. It appears to me that that disposes of this case.\nKennedy, L.J., said, at p. 1234:\nI also agree that there may be cases in which language, whether used in a Court of justice or outside a Court of Justice, may be considered as having the effect of corroboration, although there is nothing like an express admission. There may be such cases. Phillimore L.J., also thought the evidence admissible and such as the justices might act upon.\nIn the case of R. v. Feigenbaum[8], the Court of Criminal Appeal dealt with the question of corroboration in a case where the appellant had been convicted of inciting boys to steal. The boys were accomplices and their evidence, therefore, could not safely be relied upon unless corroborated.\nDarling J., delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal (Darling, Avory and Shearman JJ.), said, at pp. 433-434:\nIn this case the deputy-chairman rightly directed the jury as to the danger of believing the uncorroborated evidence of the accomplices, and as to what was, or might be, corroboration; and, in our opinion, it would, in the circumstances of this case, have been wrong for him to say that in his opinion there was no corroboration of the boys\u2019 evidence. What had happened was this. After the boys had been arrested, and statements implicating the appellant had been made by them to the police, a police officer went to the appellant\u2019s house. He gave the appellant specific information as to the names of the boys, as to what they had told the police, and as to the charge against them. The appellant did not make any reply to the statement of the police officer. We are of opinion that, in these circumstances, it would be wrong to say that there was no evidence on which the jury could find that the boys\u2019 evidence had been corroborated. The deputy-chairman quite properly pointed out to the jury that the failure of the appellant to make any reply to the statement of the police officer might, having regard to the nature of the statement and to the circumstances in which it was made, be considered as being a corroboration of the boys\u2019 evidence, that it was for the jury to consider whether in their opinion it did, or did not, amount to corroboration, and, if they thought it did, it was for them to say whether they thought there was sufficient evidence on which to convict the appellant.\nMr. Justice Avory had been a member of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the case of R. v. Baskerville (supra)[9] and was also the dissenting judge in the Divisional Court in Thomas v. Jones[10], whose judgment was afterwards approved in the reversing judgment of the Court of Appeal[11].\nWe are of the opinion that, if the conduct of the appellant when arrested and again when identified by the complainant and in making the two inconsistent statements had been found by the trial judge to be corroborative of the story of the complainant, the conviction before us could not have been set aside. Unfortunately, however, the trial judge appears not to have considered this evidence or passed upon its sufficiency. In pronouncing judgment against the appellant he said:\nThe evidence I regard as corroborative is contained in the statement of the accused whereby he admits the ownership of the car. The little girl claims that car was out there, and that was the car she was conveyed in to where the offence took place. The accused admits the ownership of the car, and that is a corroboration on a material point implicating the accused.\nFor reasons already indicated we are unable to agree with this view of the learned judge.\nThere is no finding by the trial judge as to the inference to be drawn from the conduct of the accused, already adverted to, nor any adjudication that it affords the requisite corroboration. We cannot, without usurping the exclusive function of the tribunal of fact, make such an adjudication.\nThis case does not fall within the saving operation of s. 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code (13 and 14 Geo. V, c. 41, s. 9). On the other hand the circumstances do not seem to call for an unqualified order quashing the conviction and directing the discharge of the appellant. While of the opinion that the ruling of the trial judge was erroneous and has resulted in a mistrial, we think that,\nhaving regard to the nature of the offence and the circumstances under which * * * it was committed, the present case is one in which the discretion (conferred by s. 1018\u2014now s. 1014 (3)\u2014of the Criminal Code) should be exercised in such manner as to afford the Crown an opportunity of once more putting the law in motion * * * if it thinks fit to do so.\nR. v. Burr[12].\nThe conviction, therefore, should be set aside and a new trial directed.\nConviction set aside and new trial ordered.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Isaacs & Isaacs.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Honourable R.

The insurer, denying that it had elected to reinstate, and insisting that the insured's only right was to recover money compensation, applied for the appointment, pursuant to the British Columbia Fire Insurance Policy Act and Arbitration Act, of an arbitrator, by reason of the insured's failure to appoint one. Hunter C.J. B.C. dismissed the application, but his order was set aside by the Court of Appeal ([1927] 2 W.W.R. 456) which directed a reference to appoint an arbitrator and, by a separate order, stayed the insured's action. The insured appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the insurer moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nHeld, the judgment of the Court of Appeal was a final judgment within s. 2 (e) of the Supreme Court Act; it impliedly negatived the existence of the insurer's obligation to effect a reinstatement and the insured's right to recover damages for its alleged failure to discharge its obligation in this regard; while the judgment stood, those issues were conclusively determined against the insured; it determined a substantive right of the insured in controversy in a judicial proceeding. Moreover, it was a direct, and not a merely collateral and consequential, effect of the judgment that the insured's right to sue for and recover damages alleged to exceed $2,000 was denied. The Court had, under ss. 36 and 39 (a) of the Supreme Court Act, jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The case was within the principle of Shawinigan Hydro Electric Co. v. Shawinigan Water & Power Co., 43 Can. S.C.R. 650.\nMOTION to quash appeal to this Court for want of jurisdiction. The grounds of the motion and the facts bearing on the question to be decided on the motion are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The oral reasons delivered for the judgment from which the appeal was taken are reported in [1927] 2 W.W.R. 456.\nH. A. Aylen for the motion.\nE. P. Davis K.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The respondent moves to quash this appeal for want of jurisdiction on the grounds that the judgment against which it is sought to appeal is not a final judgment and that the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal does not exceed the sum of $2,000.\nThe respondent company had insured the appellant against loss by fire. Such loss occurred and the liability therefor of the respondent is not in issue, only the amount of indemnity being contested. The policy contained the usual provision entitling the respondent to reinstate property injured or destroyed instead of making good the insured's loss by money compensation. This option, the appellant maintains, the company elected to exercise, and he brought action against it, alleging failure on its part to discharge the obligation thus undertaken and claiming $2,255 damages for such breach of contractural obligation and, alternatively, the same sum as money compensation for the loss sustained as a result of the fire. The respondent, denying that it had elected to reinstate the property and insisting that the appellant's only right was to recover money compensation for his loss, proceeded by originating summons before the Chief Justice of British Columbia in Chambers for the appointment, pursuant to the Fire Insurance Policy Act and the Arbitration Act, of an arbitrator by reason of the failure of the appellant to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to written notice in that behalf.\nThe learned Chief Justice, upholding the contention of the appellant, the insured, dismissed the motion.\nThe Court of Appeal set aside the order of the Chief Justice and directed a reference to a judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in Chambers to appoint an arbitrator as sought by the respondent company and, by a separate order, stayed the plaintiff's action pending the arbitration.\nThis judgment impliedly negatived the existence of the obligation of the company to effect reinstatement as claimed by the appellant and his right to recover damages for the alleged failure of the company to discharge its obligation in this regard. While it stands those issues are conclusively determined against the appellant. The judgment appealed from is, therefore, in our opinion, a final judgment within the definition of the Supreme Court Act (s. 2 (e) ) inasmuch at it determines a substantive right of the appellant in controversy in what is, beyond doubt, a judicial proceeding.\nMoreover, it is a direct, and not a merely collateral and consequential, effect of that judgment that the appellant's right to sue for and recover damages alleged to exceed $2,000 is. denied.\nAs the value or amount of the matter directly in controversy in this appeal from a final judgment of the highest court of final resort in the province of British Columbia exceeds the sum of $2,000, it follows that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. Sections 36 and 39 (a) of the Supreme Court Act. The case is within the principle of the decision in Shawinigan Hydro Electric Co. v. Shawinigan Water & Power Co.[1].\nThe motion to quash will accordingly be dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McPhillips & Duncan.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Walsh, McKim, Housser & Molson.\n[1] (1910), 43 Can.

Code, ss. 1013 (5), 1024\u2014Difference of opinion in Court of Appeal\u2014Absence of requisite direction under s. 1013 (5)\u2014Misdescription of count in judge's chorge to jury.\nAn appeal does not lie to this Court under s. 1024 of the Cr. Code in the absence of the direction of the court of appeal required by s. 1013 (5), which direction must be evidenced by the order of the court and should be plainly expressed (Gouin v. The King, [1926] S.C.R. 539); the plain operation and effect of s. 1013 (5) is not only to maintain the restriction of the right of appeal conferred by s. 1024 to questions of law, but also to restrict the cases in which upon questions of law lack of unanimity may be expressed to those in which the court of appeal considers it in the interest of justice that separate judgments should be pronounced by the members of the court (Davis v. The King, [1924] S.C.R. 522).\nAt the trial on a charge of perjury, the judge, when giving, near the conclusion of his address to the jury, a short recapitulation of each count in the indictment, by a slip of the tongue misdescribed a count (the one on which accused was found guilty), the substance of which he had, just before, correctly stated to the jury. An appeal from the accused's conviction to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia was dismissed ([1927] 2 W.W.R. 300), the majority of the judges holding that, notwithstanding the misstatement, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred. Two judges of the court expressed a different view on this point and were in favour of allowing the appeal and granting a new trial. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on the ground of misdirection to the jury:\nHeld, the appeal to this Court was not open to accused, by reason of the absence of the requisite direction under s. 1013 (5) ; but, its absence not having been brought to this Court's attention, and the appeal having been heard on the merits, the Court expressed the view that, on the merits, the appeal could not have succeeded. Quaere, whether, even had a dissent been regularly and legally pronounced, a difference of opinion on such a question should be considered as a dissent upon a question of law.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[1] dismissing an appeal from a conviction for perjury. The appellant was charged with having, while a witness in a judicial proceeding, falsely and with intent to mislead the magistrate holding the proceeding, deposed and sworn that (1) he had not worked for one Joe Esposito during the year 1926; (2) he had not given any evidence during the year 1926 with regard to Joe Esposito dealing in liquor; and, (3) he did not know whether or not Joe Esposito had kept intoxicating liquor for sale between the 1st January and the 21st May, 1926. The jury found him guilty on the third count.\nIn his charge to the jury the trial judge referred to the third count and stated it in substance correctly; but, very shortly afterwards, near the close of his address, in giving a short recapitulation of each count in the indictment, he misdescribed the third count by stating it to be that the appellant had falsely sworn that \" he had not given evidence with regard to Esposito having kept intoxicating liquor for sale.\"\nThe appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia on a number of grounds, including that of misdirection in reference to the third count. The appeal was dismissed[2]. The majority of the court were of opinion that, notwithstanding the said misstatement, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred. Martin and McPhillips JJA., however, expressed a different opinion on this point and were in favour of allowing the appeal and granting a new trial.\nThe formal judgment of the Court of Appeal read as follows:\u2014\nThis appeal coming on for hearing on the 5th and 6th days of January, A.D. 1927, before this Honourable Court at Victoria, B.C., in the presence of Mr. Bruce Boyd of Counsel for the Appellant and Mr. C. L. McAlpine of Counsel for the Respondent and upon hearing read the Appeal Book herein and what was alleged by counsel aforesaid and judgment being reserved until this day.\nThis Court doth order and adjudge that this appeal be and the same is hereby dismissed.\nThe appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, on the ground that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury in reference to count 3 of the indictment, and that such misdirection confused, or may have confused, the jury. E. F. Newcombe for the appellant.\nJ A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014The appellant, de Bortoli, was accused of perjury. Three different counts were laid against him in the indictment. He was charged with having falsely and with intent to mislead justice deposed and sworn that:\u2014\n1. He had not worked for one Joe Esposito ;\n2. He had not given evidence during the year 1926 with regard to Joe Esposito dealing in liquor;\n3. He did not know whether or not Joe Esposito had kept intoxicating liquor for sale between the 1st January and the 21st May, 1926.\nThe jury found him guilty on the third count.\nDe Bortoli appealed on several grounds. They were all dismissed by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia. After the argument was concluded, the Chief Justice, who presided, declared that he would dismiss the appeal and would deliver his reasons later. Then the other members of the court proceeded in turn to give their reasons, two of the judges (Martin and McPhillips JJA.) being in favour of allowing the appeal, the two others (Galliher and M. A. Macdonald JJA.) concurring with the Chief Justice. The president of the court then announced: \"The appeal is dismissed.\" In due course, came to be signed the formal judgment in which there is apparent neither dissent nor direction indicating that, in the opinion of the court, any question raised upon the appeal was \" a question of law on which it would be convenient that separate judgments should be pronounced by the members of the Court.\" (Crim. Code, s. 1013 (5)).\nThis Court, in Gouin v. The King[3], has already indicated that the direction required by ss. 5 of s. 1013 of the Criminal Code \"must be evidenced by the order of the Court and should be plainly expressed.\" It is further the unmistakable effect of our decision in Davis v. The King[4]\nthat the plain operation and effect of subsection 5 is, not only to maintain the restriction of the right of appeal conferred by section 1024 to questions of law, but also to regulate the cases in which upon questions of law lack of unanimity may be expressed so as to embrace only those cases in which the court of appeal considers it in the interest of justice that separate judgments should be pronounced by the members of the court.\nSince Davis v. The King[5], s. 1024 was amended (15-16 Geo. V, c. 38, s. 27) and its language establishes still more clearly that no appeal in criminal matters can be taken to this Court except on a \"question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.\" This amendment only confirmed the uniform interpretation which this Court had given to the former section.\nMoreover, as was stated in the Davis Case[6], this Court could not \"acquire jurisdiction by a learned judge of the court of appeal pronouncing a dissent which the statute forbids to be pronounced.\"\nIt follows that, upon the record in the present case, and having regard to the requirements of sections 1013 and 1024, an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was not open to the appellant.\nThe absence of the requisite direction under subsection 5 of section 1013 was, however, not brought to our attention and we have heard counsel on the merits of the case. We may therefore add that, had there been jurisdiction, the result could not, in our view, have been different from that reached by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia.\nThe ground of appeal was misdirection. The learned trial judge, when giving, at the conclusion of his address to the jury, a short recapitulation of each count in the indictment, by a slip of the tongue, misdescribed the third count, the substance of which he had, but a moment before, correctly stated to the jury. The three judges who concurred in dismissing the appeal were of opinion that, notwithstanding this misstatement, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had actually occurred. The two other judges thought differently.\nIt is at least doubtful whether, even had a dissent been regularly and legally pronounced, a difference of opinion on such a question should be considered as a dissent upon a question of law. It is not necessary, however, to decide that point in this case, since a careful examina- tion of the whole record and a full consideration of the able argument presented to us does not, in our view, warrant interference with the judgment of the court below.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Bruce Boyd.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C.

(The Mines Case, 1 Plowd. 310; Woolley v. Atty. Gen. of Victoria, 2 App. Cas. 163; Atty. Gen. of British Columbia v. Atty. Gen. of Canada, 14 App. Cas. 295 at p. 302). But, while the precious metals and the lands are vested in the one owner other than the Crown, such metals are part of the land, and pass from such owner by a grant in absolute terms of the fee simple estate in the land.\nUnder the Royal Charter of 1670, the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, prior to the acceptance on 23rd June, 1870, of its deed of surrender of 19th November, 1869, owned the precious metals in the territories granted to it. The source of its title, alike to the precious metals and to the lands in which they lay, was the grant from the Crown. The precious metals in the land were partes soli while owned by the company. It held land and precious metals alike by the same proprietary title.\nThe said deed of surrender from the company to the Crown should be construed, having regard to the nature and object of the agreement pursuant to which it was made, and to the operative words in the deed itself, as carrying, as partes soli, the precious metals in the lands surrendered.\nAfter the execution and acceptance of the deed of surrender, the precious metals in Rupert\u2019s Land again belonged to the Crown by prerogative right, and under the Order in Council of 23rd June, 1870, the beneficial interest in, and the right of governmental control over, them was transferred to, and became vested in the Dominion of Canada.\nAs to the posts or stations \u201cretained\u201d by the company, excepted from the deed of surrender, the precious metals in the subjacent lands passed under the general terms of the surrender to the Crown. An exception in a deed of grant should be taken most strongly against the party for whose benefit it is introduced, and should be allowed to control the instrument only in so far as its words extend; and, having regard to this ordinary rule of construction, and to the fact that it was an exception out of property being transferred to the Crown, and to the object of the exception, and to the nature and purpose of the instrument in which it occurred, it must be construed as not including the precious metals.\nAs to the blocks of land (adjacent to the posts or stations) to be \u201cselected\u201d by the company, and the areas in the fertile belt of which they might claim grants, the intent to be taken from the deed of surrender is that the lands, were to pass under the general surrender, but on the term or condition that, after they had been transferred to the Dominion of Canada and surveys had been made and the right of \u201cselection\u201d or \u201cclaim\u201d had matured, the Crown through the Dominion Government would re-grant or re-transfer to the company the blocks so to be \u201cselected\u201d and the parcels so to be \u201cclaimed.\u201d When the surrendered lands vested in the Crown and all effects of the earlier grant of them to the company had been extinguished (Rupert\u2019s Land Act, 1868, s. 4), the precious metals in such lands, which had been granted out of the prerogative, again belonged to the Crown by prerogative right (Atty. Gen. v. Trustees of the British Museum, [1903] 2 ch. 598, at pp. 612-3); whereas its title to the lands surrendered (exclusive of such metals) was proprietary. Upon such re-grants or re-transfers to the company, however effected, precious metals would not pass unless specifically mentioned and covered by apt and precise words. Accordingly, it must be held that the precious metals in all such lands have, since the execution and acceptance of the deed of surrender, belonged to the Crown.\n(If the company\u2019s right to the precious metals subsisted as a franchise, its surrender of such, by the terms of the deed of 1869, was complete and without exception or qualification.)\nThe above construction accords with the nature and purpose of the agreement pursuant to which the deed of surrender was made. The purpose undoubtedly was to preserve intact the Crown\u2019s prerogative rights throughout the new territory acquired by the Dominion of Canada. The construction is also supported by the company\u2019s subsequent conduct in accepting grants from the Dominion of the \u201cselected\u201d blocks of land (including in the description of them the lands on which the \u201cretained\u201d posts and stations were actually erected) and in assenting to the provisions of the Dominion Lands Act of 1872 (ss. 17-21) and of the Canadian Order in Council of 6th December, 1872, being substituted for those of the deed of surrender of Rupert\u2019s Land in all matters pertaining to the company\u2019s one-twentieth of the lands within the Fertile Belt. The company must be taken to have implicitly recognized that its deed of surrender had operated to vest all these lands in the Crown, subject to the company\u2019s right to have them re-granted or re-transferred to it in its new capacity as a purely trading corporation.\nS. 36 of the Dominion Lands Act of 1872, providing that \u201cno reservation of gold, silver, iron, copper, or other mines or minerals shall be inserted in any patent from the Crown granting any portion of the Dominion lands\u201d (repealed, 43 Vic., c. 26; and see declaratory legislation, 46 Vic., c. 17, a 43) did not necessarily imply that the gold and silver in all Dominion lands (including those reserved for the company) to be granted should pass to the grantees (The Mines Case, 1 Plowd. 310; Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 6th ed., pp. 244-5; 31 Vic., c. 1, s. 6 (23)); and it cannot be said that in accepting the provisions of the Dominion Lands Act of 1872 and of the Order in Council of 6th December, 1872, the company was under the impression that it would thereby become entitled to the precious metals underlying the lands for which it might subsequently obtain grants or titles by notification under s. 21 of the statute.\nREFERENCE by His Excellency the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada, under and pursuant to the Supreme Court Act, of certain questions for hearing and consideration as to the power of the Parliament of Canada and of the Government of Canada over the precious metals, gold and silver, in, under and upon, certain lands of The Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson\u2019s Bay, commonly called the Hudson\u2019s Day Company, and as to the ownership of the said precious metals.\nThe Order in Council providing for the reference was dated 26th January, 1926 (P.C. 108), and was amended by Order in Council dated 12th October, 1926 (P.C. 1561).\nThe following is a statement of the case and questions, submitted for decision, as agreed upon between the Minister of Justice, on behalf of the Government of Canada, and the Company:\n\u201cWhereas questions have arisen as to the power of the Parliament of Canada and of the Government of Canada over the precious metals, gold and silver, in, under or upon lands of The Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson\u2019s Bay, hereinafter called the Company, and as to the ownership of the said precious metals:\nAnd Whereas it is deemed advisable to refer the said questions to The Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration:\nAnd Whereas the opinion of the said Supreme Court is desired upon the following case:\u2014\n1. By letters patent granted by His late Majesty, King Charles the Second, bearing date the 2nd day of May, 1670, the Company was granted the lands and territories as therein described, also the gold and silver to be found or discovered therein and other rights, etc., the whole as more fully described in said letters patent, a true copy whereof is annexed hereto as Schedule \u2018A.\u2019\n2. By Deed of Surrender bearing date the 19th day of November, 1869, the Company did surrender to Her late Majesty on the terms and conditions of the said Surrender, and on condition of the said Surrender being accepted pursuant to the provisions of The Rupert\u2019s Land Act, 1868, all the rights of government and other rights, privileges, liberties, franchises, powers and authorities granted or purported to be granted to the Company by the said letters patent, and also all the lands and territories within Rupert\u2019s Land (except and subject as in the said terms and conditions mentioned) granted or purported to be granted to the Company by the said letters patent.\n3. The said Surrender was duly accepted, and by Order of Her late Majesty in Council, bearing date the 23rd day of June, 1870, Rupert\u2019s Land and the North-West Territories were admitted into the Dominion of Canada. Schedule \u2018B\u2019 hereto contains a true copy of the said The Rupert\u2019s Land Act, 1868, Order in Council and Surrender.\n4. The Company, pursuant to the said Deed of Surrender and Order in Council, retained all the posts or stations actually possessed and occupied by it or its officers or agents at the time of the said Surrender and after the acceptance of said Surrender, duly selected blocks of land adjoining each of its posts or stations within any part of British North America, not comprised in Canada and British Columbia. 5. Since the said Surrender was so made and accepted, the Crown, represented by the Dominion of Canada, has issued patents of the lands so selected adjoining each of its said posts or stations and the said patents also included the land actually possessed and occupied by the Company as posts or stations at the time of the said Surrender. Schedule \u2018C\u2019 hereto is a true copy of one of said patents bearing date the 27th of January, 1882, and the other patents were issued in the same form.\n6. One of the terms and conditions of the said Surrender was that the Company might at any time within fifty years after the acceptance of the said Surrender claim in any township or district within the fertile belt as therein described in which land is set out for settlement grants of land not exceeding one-twentieth part of the land so set out, the same to be determined by lot.\n7. The Dominion Lands Act, Chapter 23 of the Statutes of Canada, 1872, contains provisions relating to lands to which the Company became entitled under such conditions in the said surrender. An Order in Council was passed by the Dominion Government on the 6th of December, 1872, a true copy of which is annexed hereto as Schedule \u2018D,\u2019 and the Company on the 7th of January, 1873, adopted the Resolution a copy of which is annexed hereto as Schedule \u2018E.\u2019\n8. The Company has from time to time received title by notification of the surveys of townships and confirmation thereof to certain sections and parts of sections within the territory described as the fertile belt, and has also from time to time received title by patent from the Crown, represented by the Dominion of Canada, to other sections and parts of sections of land within the fertile belt, for the Company\u2019s one-twentieth of the lands in fractional townships and in townships broken by lakes and in lieu of the sections or parts of sections allotted to the Company found to be settled upon. None of the said patents so issued expressly refer to the precious metals or to any minerals. Schedule \u2018F\u2019 hereto contains a copy of one of such notifications, bearing date the 30th of June, 1881, and Schedule \u2018G\u2019 hereto contains a copy of one of said patents issued to the Company for such lands in fractional townships, bearing date the 7th of July, 1910. Schedule \u2018H\u2019 hereto contains a copy of one of said patents issued to the Company for land in lieu of land so settled upon, bearing date the 10th of May, 1913. These may be regarded as typical of such documents.\n9. At the request of the Crown, the Company from time to time, before receiving title to sections or parts of sections of land to which it was entitled, relinquished and surrendered its rights thereto, and obtained patents for other lands in lieu thereof from the Crown. Neither the said surrenders nor the said patents contain any express mention of minerals.\n10. The Company, after having received title to sections and parts of sections of land within the said fertile belt, has from time to time, at the request of the Crown, conveyed to the Crown the said lands, and obtained patents from the Crown for other lands in lieu thereof. Neither the said conveyances from the Company nor the said patents contain any express mention of minerals, and the lands so patented to the Company comprise lands both within and without the said fertile belt.\n11. Therefore it is desired to refer for hearing and consideration to the Supreme Court of Canada certain questions which, for the sake only of convenience and not as intending to waive, release or affect any rights or claims of any party, are confined to lands in the area now included in the Northwest Territories and in the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the said questions being as follows:\u2014\n1. In whom, after the acceptance of the said Surrender and the passing of the said Order in Council of the 23rd day of June, 1870, were vested the precious metals, gold and silver, in, under or upon, the lands in the said area possessed and occupied at the date of the said surrender as posts or stations by the Company, its officers or agents, whether in the Crown represented by the Dominion of Canada, or in the Company?\n2. In whom were vested the precious metals, gold and silver, in, under or upon the blocks of land adjoining the said posts or stations of the Company and selected by the Company, whether in the Crown represented by the Dominion of Canada or in the Company:\u2014\n(a) Upon the selection by the Company of the said blocks of land.\n(b) Upon the issue to the Company of the Crown patents for the said blocks of land?\n3. In whom were vested the precious metals, gold and silver, in, under or upon, the sections of land or parts thereof in the said fertile belt which were vested in the Company by notification, upon such notification, whether in the Crown represented by the Dominion of Canada, or in the Company?\n4. In whom were vested the precious metals, gold and silver, in, under or upon, the land granted to the Company by letters patent from the Crown upon the issue thereof:\u2014\n(a) In satisfaction of the Company\u2019s one-twentieth of the land in fractional townships, or in townships broken by lakes.\n(b) In lieu of lands allotted to the Company but found to be settled upon?\n5. In whom were vested the precious metals, gold and silver, in, under or upon, the lands granted to the Company by letters patent in lieu of land in which the Company relinquished and surrendered its rights to the Crown upon the issue of such patents?\n6. In whom were vested the precious metals, gold and silver, in, under or upon, the land granted to the Company by letters patent in lieu of land conveyed by the Company to the Crown upon the issue of such patents?\n7. If in any of such cases the precious metals, gold and silver, were vested in the Company, did the repeal of section 37 of The Dominion Lands Act, 1879, Chapter 31 of 42 Victoria, by section 6 of Chapter 26 of 43 Victoria, or the enactment of section 43 of Chapter 17 of 46 Victoria, or of The Dominion Lands Act, Chapter 20 of 7 and 8 Edward VII, or any other enactment affect the ownership of the said precious metals in such case?\n12. For the purpose of such hearing and consideration, the said Court may in addition to such other facts and matters as the Court may see, fit, take into consideration the statements, facts and documents herein mentioned or set forth, and the Statutes of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and of the Parliament of Canada, hearing upon such questions, and the fact that the Company was not requested to consent to and did not consent to the amendment or repeal of any of the provisions of The Dominion Lands Act of 1872, and such other statements, facts and documents, as may be submitted to the Court by order of the Governor in Council.\u201d\nIt was not intended by the reference to raise any issues as between the Dominion and any province, and it was provided that, so far as any lands in the province of Manitoba were concerned, questions numbers 1, 2 and 3 might be answered as if the words \u201crepresented by the Dominion of Canada\u201d, where they occur after the word \u201cCrown\u201d in each of said questions, were struck out, and that, in answering any of the questions referred, it would be sufficient to state what were the rights of the Crown and the Company, respectively, without indicating whether any of the rights of the Crown are vested in the Dominion or the Province.\nPursuant to an order of the Court, notification of the hearing of the agreement was sent to the Attorneys General of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, and was published in the Canada Gazette. The Attorneys General of the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan were represented by counsel at the hearing. Their respective factums, after referring to the fact that the province was not a party to the reference, and after referring to the intention, as above indicated, that no issues were to be raised as between the Dominion and any province, etc., supported the position taken by the Dominion as to the rights of the Crown.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and O. M. Biggar K.C. for the Attorney General of Canada.\nF. H. Chrysler K.C. for the Province of Manitoba.\nH. Fisher K.C. for the Province of Saskatchewan.\nD. H. Laird K.C. and G. P. R. Tallin for the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nAnglin C. J. C.\u2014Under the authority of s. 60 of the Supreme Court Act His Excellency the Governor General in Council has referred to the Court for hearing, consideration and answer a series of questions relating to the ownership of the precious metals in lands formerly \u201cheld or claimed to be held\u201d by the Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson\u2019s Bay\u201d (31-2 Vic., (Imp.), c. 105, s. 2), and now included in the Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta and the North-West Territories of Canada.\nThat the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, prior to the 23rd of June, 1870, owned the precious metals in the territories granted to it in 1670 by Charter from King Charles II is indisputable. That Royal Charter vested in the Company not only all the lands and territories comprised in Rupert\u2019s Land as therein described, not already actually possessed by or granted to any of the King\u2019s subjects or possessed by the subjects of any other Christian Prince or State, but also in express terms\nall mines Royal, as well discovered as not discovered, of Gold, Silver, Gems, and precious Stones to be found or discovered within the Territories, Limits and Places aforesaid.\nIt was decided in 1568 in The Mines Case[1] that, although all mines of gold and silver within the realm, while held by the Crown, are not to be regarded as partes soli or as incidents of the land in which they are found, and are not held (as are the lands of the Crown and the baser metals contained in them) by proprietary title, whether they be in the lands of the Queen or of subjects (p. 336), they may, nevertheless,\nby grant of the King be severed from the Crown and be granted to another, for it is not an incident inseparable to the Crown but may be severed from it by appropriate and precise words (p. 336A).\nThe law of England in these particulars, as thus defined in The Mines Case, persists to the present day (Woolley v. Attorney General of Victoria[2]; Attorney General of British Columbia v. Attorney General of Canada[3]; and it is conceded that according to that law the questions now before us must be answered. The title, therefore, of the Governor and Company under the Royal Charter of 1670 to the precious metals in Rupert\u2019s Land was beyond cavil. They were \u201cabsolute lords and proprietors of the territory\u201d, saving the allegiance due to His Majesty.\nIndeed this was common ground between counsel; and this aspect of the matter is now dwelt on only to give prominence to the fact that the source of the Company\u2019s title alike to the precious metals and to the lands in which they lie was the grant from the Crown. Both were granted to the Company by the same Royal Charter.\nConsequent upon such grant, as is stated in the factum of the Company (p. 3), the precious metals in the land transferred to it \u201cbecame part of the land the same as other metals\u201d, because (p. 6),\nwhile the precious metals and the lands are vested in the one owner other than the Crown, such metals are part of the land and pass from such owner by a grant in absolute terms of the fee simple estate in the land;\nand again (p. 7),\nThe ownership of precious metals by the owner of the land in which they are found is not a right, privilege, liberty, franchise, power or authority. In such a case it is part of his estate in the land. Even if it were a right while held by the Crown, or a person other than the owner of the land, once it is vested in the owner of the land it merges in the land and becomes extinguished.\nIn this view counsel for the Crown are also fully agreed; and, as will presently appear, it meets the chief difficulty suggested by counsel for the Company in regard to the scope and effect of the deed of surrender to the Crown in 1870, apart from those which it is argued arise upon the terms and conditions contained in that instrument and subject to which it was given.\nPrior to Confederation the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company seems to have been quite ready, if not anxious, to part with its proprietary rights and franchises to the English Crown for a consideration. Indeed negotiations were being carried on, as appears from correspondence set out in the Company\u2019s factum, to achieve that purpose. In the Canadian Confederation scheme as formulated in the British North America Act of 1867 provision was made (s. 146) for the admission into the Union, on address from the Houses of Parliament of Canada, of\nRupert\u2019s Land and the North-Western Territory, or either of them * * * on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the Addresses expressed and as the Queen thinks fit to approve, subject to the provisions of this Act;\nand the statute proceeded to declare that\nthe provisions of any Order in Council in that behalf shall have the same effect as if they had been enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nNegotiations ensued between representatives1 of the Company and of the Dominion Government, in which the Colonial Office also intervened. These culminated in an arrangement whereby, subject to certain terms and conditions, notably the payment to the Company of \u00a3300,000 stg. and the retention or reservation by it, or an undertaking for a re-grant to it, of certain of its holdings, the Company was to surrender and relinquish to the Crown\nall rights of government and proprietary rights and all other privileges, liberties, franchises, powers and authorities whatsoever granted or purported to be granted by the said Letters Patent (of 1670);\nand upon such surrender all such rights, franchises, etc. were to be \u201cabsolutely extinguished\u201d and the territory so surrendered was, by Order in Council, to be transferred to, and to become part of, the Dominion of Canada as contemplated by the British North America Act. The negotiations and their outcome are evidenced by various resolutions, letters and documents set out in the case before us, which, however, it does not seem necessary to quote in detail. To enable the arrangement above sketched to be carried out, the Imperial Parliament passed the Rupert\u2019s Land Act, 1868. This statute it may, perhaps, be advisable to set out in part:\nAfter reciting the grant by the Company\u2019s Charter and the relevant provision of s. 146 of the British North America Act, the statute proceeds:\nAnd whereas for the purpose of carrying into effect the Provisions of the said British North America Act, 1867, and of admitting Rupert\u2019s Land into the said Dominion as aforesaid upon such terms as Her Majesty thinks fit to approve, it is expedient that the said Lands, Territories, Rights, Privileges, Liberties, Franchises, Powers and Authorities so far as the same have been lawfully granted to the said Company shall be surrendered to Her Majesty, Her Heirs and Successors, upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon between Her Majesty, and the said Governor and Company as hereinafter mentioned:\nBe it therefore enacted, etc., as follows:\u2014\n1. This Act may be cited as \u201cRupert\u2019s Land Act, 1868.\u201d\n2. For the Purposes of this Act the Term \u201cRupert\u2019s Land\u201d shall include the whole of the Lands and Territories held or claimed to be held by the said Governor and Company. 3. It shall be competent for the said Governor and Company to surrender to Her Majesty, and for Her Majesty by any Instrument under her Sign Manual and Signet, to accept, Surrender of all or any of the Lands, Territories, Rights, Privileges, Liberties, Franchises, Powers and Authorities, whatsoever granted or purported to be granted by the said Letters Patent to the said Governor and Company within Rupert\u2019s Land upon such terms and conditions as shall be agreed upon by and between Her Majesty and the said Governor and Company; provided, however, that such Surrender shall not be accepted by Her Majesty until the Terms and Conditions upon which Rupert\u2019s Land shall be admitted into the said Dominion of Canada shall have been approved of by Her Majesty, and embodied in an Address to Her Majesty from both the Houses of the Parliament of Canada in pursuances of the One Hundred and Forty-sixth Section of the British North America Act, 1807, and that the said Surrender and Acceptance thereof shall be null and void unless within a month from the date of such Acceptance Her Majesty does by Order in Council under the Provisions of the said last recited Act admit Rupert\u2019s Land into the said Dominion; provided further, that no charge shall be imposed by such terms upon the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom.\n4. Upon the acceptance by Her Majesty of such surrender all Rights of Government and Proprietary Rights, and all other Privileges, Liberties, Franchises, Powers, and Authorities whatsoever, granted or purported to be granted by the said Letters Patent to the said Governor and Company within Rupert\u2019s Land, and which shall have been so surrendered, shall be absolutely extinguished; provided that nothing herein contained shall prevent the said Governor and Company from continuing to carry on in Rupert\u2019s Land or elsewhere Trade and Commerce.\n5. It shall be competent to Her Majesty by any such Order or Orders in Council as aforesaid, on Address from the Houses of Parliament of Canada, to declare that Rupert\u2019s Land shall, from a date to be therein mentioned, be admitted into and become part of the Dominion of Canada; and thereupon it shall be lawful for the Parliament of Canada from the date aforesaid to make, ordain and establish within the Land and Territory so admitted as aforesaid all such Laws, Institutions and Ordinances, and to constitute such Courts and Officers, as may be necessary for the Peace, Order and Good Government of Her Majesty\u2019s Subjects and others therein: Provided that, until otherwise enacted by the said Parliament of Canada, all the Powers, Authorities, and Jurisdiction of the Several Courts of Justice now established in Rupert\u2019s Land, and of the several Officers thereof, and of all Magistrates and Justices now acting within the said Limits, shall continue in full force and effect therein.\nA formal deed of surrender to the Crown was executed by the Company in 1869, and in June, 1870, matters had so far progressed that an Imperial Order in Council was passed accepting such surrender and admitting Rupert\u2019s Land and the North Western Territory into the Dominion of Canada. Thus the vast territory extending from the Lake of the Woods and Lake Winnipeg and Hudson\u2019s Bay in the East to the Rocky Mountains in the West became part of Canada \u201cfrom and after the 15th of July, 1870.\u201d\nIt is chiefly concerning the scope and effect of the deed of surrender of 1869 that the controversy now before us has arisen. No question is presented as to the respective interests of the Crown in right of Canada and of the Crown in right of the several provinces; the only questions are whether the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company or the Crown is entitled to the precious metals, gold and silver, \u201cin, under or upon\u201d the lands which formed the subject of the deed of surrender or any of them, and, subject to what is to be said at a later stage as to the possible effect of subsequent legislation, the solution of these questions depends upon the construction of the terms of the deed of surrender itself.\nIn approaching this problem of construction the first feature of the deed which attracts our attention is the recital, immediately preceding the operative paragraph, that\nthe surrender hereinafter contained is intended to be made in pursuance of the agreement * * * hereinbefore stated,\ni.e., the agreement above outlined. It is of vital moment that the purpose and object of that agreement should be well in mind in construing the surrender in order that, consistently with its terms, it may be given the scope and meaning that will best carry into effect the intent with which it was made. A company which had theretofore owned territories having the extent of a vast empire, which had throughout those territories enjoyed the widest powers of government and administration together with rights, faculties, franchises, privileges and prerogatives that usually appertain to a sovereign state, or, under the system now prevalent in the British Empire, to one of its self-governing constituent parts, and which, as incidental to the possession of such powers of government and administration, had been accorded the Royal prerogative of taking the Royal fish in the waters within and contiguous to its territories and also the Royal prerogative of owning and exploiting the Royal Mines within such territories, was surrendering to the Crown all these powers, rights and franchises as well as its proprietary rights, and this surrender was being made with the object that the rights, governmental and proprietary, and the franchises so surrendered should be extinguished in order to pave the way for the transfer by Her Majesty of the fullest rights of government and administration over, and ownership of, the territory in question to the new Dominion of Canada. The Company as an instrument of government was to pass from the scene and was thereafter to carry on solely as a trading corporation, holding its trading posts and stations, with immediately adjacent parcels of land needed for their proper conduct, and receiving, as part consideration for the surrender it was making, a right to parcels of land in the so-called Fertile Belt (part of the surrendered territory) equal to one-twentieth of the portions thereof to be opened for settlement. The Company was to exercise and possess for the future no rights other than those of a private trading corporation owning property in Canada. Indeed so complete and all-embracing was the contemplated surrender of its rights, powers and franchises that it was deemed prudent, no doubt to preclude possible misapprehension, explicitly to provide in The Rupert\u2019s Land Act, 1868 (s. 4)\nthat nothing herein contained shall prevent the said Governor and Company from continuing to carry on in Rupert\u2019s Land or elsewhere Trade and Commerce.\nWhatever reasons there may have been for the original grant to the Company of Royal prerogative rights ceased to exist on the acceptance of the surrender. Governmental control over and administration of, and all beneficial interest in, the territories which the Company was relinquishing were thereafter to be vested in the Dominion of Canada. These were the salient features of the arrangement pursuant to, and as a step towards the accomplishment of, which the deed of surrender was made.\nWhat did the Company purport to surrender?\nThe operative clause of the deed is in these terms:\nNow know ye, and these presents witness, that, in pursuance of the powers and provisions of the \u201cRupert\u2019s Land Act, 1868,\u201d and on the terms and conditions aforesaid, and also on condition of this surrender being accepted pursuant to the provisions of that Act, the said Governor and Company do hereby surrender to the Queen\u2019s Most Gracious Majesty, all the rights of government, and other rights, privileges, liberties, franchises, powers and authorities, granted or purported to be granted to the said Governor and Company by the said recited Letters Patent of His Late Majesty King Charles the Second, and also all similar rights which may have been exercised or assumed by the said Governor and Company in any parts of British North America, not forming part of Rupert\u2019s Land or of Canada, or of British Columbia, and all the lands and territories within Rupert\u2019s Land (except and subject as in the said terms and conditions mentioned) granted or purported to be granted to the said Governor and Company by the said Letters Patent.\nReading this clause, for the moment, as if it did not contain the words in brackets, the generality of its language is ex facie unrestricted. All the Company\u2019s lands and territories within Rupert\u2019s Land (and it had no title to any lands in the North-Western Territory except, perhaps, by occupation) granted or purported to be granted to it by its Royal Charter of 1670 were surrendered to the Crown. In those lands were undoubtedly then included the precious metals as well as other metals lying in, under or upon them. The precious metals therein were partes soli while owned by the Company. They had been \u201cgranted\u201d to it by the same letters patent which \u201cgranted\u201d the lands themselves. The Company held land and precious metals alike by the same proprietary title. The description in the deed of surrender \u201cAll the lands and territories within Rupert\u2019s Land * * * granted or purported to be granted to the said Governor and Company by the said Letters Patent\u201d was, therefore, apt and sufficient to carry, and we have not the slightest doubt was meant to carry, as partes soli the precious metals in the lands surrendered. Such is the literal and legal meaning of the words of the surrender; and that such was the intent with which they were used, having regard to the nature and objects of the agreement pursuant to which the deed of surrender purports to have been made, does not, we think, admit of question.\nBut, while that may be so as to the surrendered lands in which the Company ceased to have any further interest, it is contended on its behalf that in the lands \u201cretained\u201d by it as posts, and in those to be \u201cselected\u201d as adjacent blocks, and also in the lands agreed to be granted to it as part consideration for the surrender to the Crown, its estate and interest (including the ownership of the precious metals therein) is still the same as that which it formerly held in all the territory of Rupert\u2019s Land under the Royal Charter of 1670. These particular lands, it was argued, did not pass from the Company by the surrender, but were either excepted or reserved from it; and much emphasis was placed by counsel on the word \u201cexcept\u201d in the interjected parenthetical phrase \u201c(except and subject as in the said terms and conditions mentioned)\u201d in the operative clause of the surrender.\nIt may be noted en passant that the word \u201cexcept\u201d does not occur in s. 3 of the Rupert\u2019s Land Act, 1868. It is found, however, in the recital of the deed of surrender made in the Order in Council of the 23rd of June, 1870, and it certainly cannot be ignored. The real question is as to the purview and extent of the exception to which it refers.\nThe clauses in the terms and conditions set forth in the surrender dealing with the lands in which the Company did not finally relinquish all interest are as follows:\n2. The company to retain all the posts or stations now actually possessed and occupied by them or their officers or agents whether in Rupert\u2019s Land or any other part of British North America, and may within twelve months after the acceptance of the said surrender select a block of land adjoining each of their posts or stations, within any part of British North America not comprised in Canada and British Columbia in conformity, except as regards the Red River Territory, with a list made out by the Company and communicated to the Canadian Ministers, being the list in the annexed schedule. The actual survey is to be proceeded with, with all convenient speed.\n* * *\n5. The Company may, at any time within fifty years after the acceptance of the said surrender, claim in any township or district within the fertile belt in which land is set out for settlements, grants of land not exceeding one-twentieth part of the land so set out; the blocks so granted to be determined by lot, and the Company to pay a rateable share of the survey expenses, not exceeding 8 cents Canadian an acre. The Company may defer the exercise of their right of claiming their proportion of each township or district for not more than ten years after it is set out, but their claim must be limited to an allotment from the lands remaining unsold at the time they declare their intention to make it.\n6. For the purpose of the last article the fertile belt is to be bounded as follows: On the South by the United States boundary; on the West by the Rocky Mountains; on the North by the Northern Branch of the Saskatchewan River; on the East by Lake Winnipeg, the Lake of the Woods and the waters connecting them.\nThe posts or stations to be \u201cretained\u201d, the blocks of adjacent land to be \u201cselected\u201d and the areas in the fertile belt of which the Company \u201cmight claim grants\u201d seem to have been carefully distinguished each from the others, and apparently an attempt was made to apply to each a term deemed apt to express the legal process to which it was designed to be subjected.\nThe word \u201cretain\u201d no doubt signifies that the particular property to which it refers remained with the Company and did not form part of the property surrendered. To property so retained the word \u201cexcept\u201d in the parenthetical clause of the operative paragraph of the deed of surrender finds appropriate application.\nWe are, however, here dealing with an exception and it occurs in a transfer, by way of surrender, to the Crown. Because it is an exception it should be taken most strongly against the party for whose benefit it is introduced (Sheppard\u2019s Touchstone, 8th ed., p. 100; Savill Brothers, Ltd. v. Bethell[4]) and should be allowed to \u201ccontrol the instrument as far as the words of it extend and no further\u201d \u2014Burnett v. Kensington[5]; and the circumstance that the exception occurs in a transfer of property to the Crown by no means weakens the case for the application of this ordinary rule of construction\u2014Willion v. Berkley[6]. The apparent purpose of the exception will be fully met if its operation be restricted to the buildings used as posts and stations (including out-houses, etc.) and, in the lands they occupy, to the fee simple, which the subject ordinarily holds. Ownership of the precious metals in such subjacent soil cannot be regarded from any point of view as necessary to the fullest use and enjoyment of these posts or stations for the trading purposes to which the future activities of the Company were to be confined. Having regard, therefore, to the object of the exception, to the nature and purpose of the instrument in which it occurs, and to the fact that it is an exception out of property being transferred to the Crown, we are satisfied that it should be held not to include the precious metals in the subjacent lands. These were left to pass under the general terms of the surrender to the Crown.\nIn the case of the lands to be \u201cselected\u201d and in that of the parcels of which the Company was to become entitled to \u201cclaim grants\u201d the intent of the instrument would rather seem to be that these lands were to pass to Her Majesty under the general surrender of all the Company\u2019s lands, but on the term or condition that, after they had been transferred to the Dominion of Canada and surveys had been made and the right of \u201cselection\u201d or \u201cclaim\u201d had matured, the Crown through the Dominion Government would re-grant or re-transfer to the Company the blocks so to be \u201cselected\u201d and the parcels so to be \u201cclaimed\u201d. Upon such re-grants or re-transfers, however effected, precious metals in the lands so dealt with would not pass unless specifically mentioned and covered by apt and precise words. When the surrendered lands vested in the Crown and all effects of the earlier grant of them to the Company had been extinguished (the Rupert\u2019s Land Act, 1868, s. 4), the precious metals in such lands, which had been granted out of the prerogative, again belonged to the Crown by prerogative right (Attorney General v. Trustees of the British Museum[7]); whereas its title to the lands surrendered (exclusive of such metals) was proprietary.\nIt may be that upon the necessary surveys being completed, so that the lands which were to pass to the Company\u2014whether as selected blocks or as part of the one-twentieth of the lands opened for settlement in the fertile belt which it was entitled to claim\u2014were designated and definitely located, it immediately acquired title to such lands (The Queen v. Farwell[8]; Wright v. Roseberry[9]) and that the subsequent grants when taken, and the notification of the surveys when given under s. 21 of the Dominion Lands Act, 1872, amounted to nothing more than evidence of titles already vested. Nevertheless, the facts that such grants were provided for and were taken, and that the title defined by s. 21 as being in fee simple was recognized by the Company as the complement of its rights under the \u201creservation\u201d in the deed of surrender, lose none of their significance. Titles to lands evidenced by grants from the Crown to subjects and estates in fee simple do not, in the absence of explicit words apt and precise to indicate them, carry the prerogative right to the precious metals.\nHaving regard to the nature and purpose of the agreement between the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, the Canadian Government and the Imperial Government (represented by the Colonial Secretary), as a step towards the carrying out of which the deed of surrender was executed, it is scarcely possible to conceive that it was intended that here and there throughout the great territory which it was acquiring the Dominion of Canada should find numerous sections of land in which the prerogative right of the Crown to precious metals had been relinquished in favour of a purely trading company. That it must have been the purpose of the high contracting parties to preserve intact the prerogative rights of the Crown throughout that new part of the Dominion seems to us reasonably certain; and it is satisfactory to find that upon a fair construction the provisions of the deed of surrender now under consideration give effect to that intent.\nIf, however, notwithstanding its ownership of the soil in which the precious metals in question lay, the right of the Company to them subsisted as a franchise, it is scarcely necessary to observe that the surrender to the Crown by the deed of 1869 of all franchises granted to the Company by the Royal Charter of 1670 is complete and without exception or qualification.\nSubject to what is to be said as to the possible effect of subsequent Canadian legislation, we accordingly conclude that after the execution and acceptance of the deed of surrender in 1870 the precious metals in Rupert\u2019s Land again belonged to the Crown by prerogative right, as they always had in the North Western Territory, and that, under the Order in Council of the 23rd June, 1870, the beneficial interest in, and the right of governmental control over, them was transferred to and became vested in the Dominion of Canada. The Trusts and Guarantee Co. v. The King[10]; Attorney General of Canada v. Attorney General of Alberta[11].\nThe subsequent conduct of the Company in accepting grants from the Dominion of Canada of the \u201cselected\u201d blocks of land (including in the description of them the lands on which the \u201cretained\u201d posts and stations were actually erected) and in assenting to the provisions of the Dominion Lands Act of 1872 (ss. 17-21) and of the Canadian Order in Council of the 6th of December, 1872, being substituted for those of the deed of surrender of Rupert\u2019s Land in all matters pertaining to the Company\u2019s one-twentieth of the lands within the fertile belt, afford a strong indication, to say the least, that the construction which we have put upon the stipulations of the deed of surrender in regard to the so-called \u201creservations\u201d in the Company\u2019s favour, was that which the Company itself understood them to bear. By taking Crown grants of the selected blocks and of its one-twentieth share in the fractional townships and of substituted lands, where the sections that would have fallen to it were already bona fide settled on, and by acceding to the provisions of s. 21 of the Dominion Lands Act, under which it took statutory titles in fee simple, the Company implicitly recognized that its deed of surrender had operated to vest all these lands in the Crown, subject to the Company\u2019s right to have them re-granted or re-transferred to it in its new capacity as a purely trading corporation.\nInasmuch as The Manitoba Act (33 Vic., c. 3, s. 30), The Alberta Act, (4-5 Edw. 7., c. 3, s. 23), and The Saskatchewan Act (4-5 Edw. 7, c. 42, s. 23) contain provisions which expressly save the rights and properties of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company from prejudice, nothing in any of these statutes affects the question now before us.\nThere is, however, a provision of the Dominion Lands Act of 1872 which calls for special notice. Section 36 of that Act reads as follows:\n36. No reservation of gold, silver, iron, copper, or other mines or minerals shall be inserted in any patent from the Crown granting any portion of the Dominion lands.\nIn the Consolidation of 1879 (42 Vic. c. 31) that section was repeated verbatim as s. 37. By an amending Act of 1880 (43 Vic. c. 26 s. 6) it was repealed. In 1883 (46 Vic., c. 17) there was a new consolidation of the Dominion Lands Act which contains the following section:\n(43) It is hereby declared that no grant from the Crown, of lands in freehold or for any less estate, has operated or will operate as a conveyance of the gold and silver mines therein, unless the same are expressly conveyed in such grant.\nIn the revision of 1886 (c. 54) we find this section substantially repeated, as s. 48, in the following terms:\nNo grant from the Crown of lands in freehold or for any less estate, shall be deemed to have conveyed or to convey the gold or silver mines therein, unless the same are expressly conveyed in such grant. The section of 1886 was carried verbatim into the subsequent revision of 1906 (c. 55) as s. 161. But in the Dominion Lands Act, when again consolidated in 1908 (7-8 Edw. 7, c. 20), no similar section appears. It was strongly pressed upon us that the necessary implication of s. 36 in the Act of 1872 (s. 37 of 1879) is that the gold and silver in all Dominion lands (including those reserved for the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company) to be granted should pass to the grantee and it was said that it was upon this basis that the Company had agreed in January, 1873, to substitute the Dominion Lands Act and the Order in Council of the 6th of December, 1872, for the provisions contained in the deed of surrender, relating to the Company\u2019s one-twentieth of lands set out for settlement within the Fertile Belt, and that it had never assented to any change in the rights thus assured to it.\nUnder the law of England, as settled in The Mines Case[12], and under the well-established rule for the construction of statutes, that it is presumed that the Legislature does not intend to deprive the Crown of any prerogative, right or property, unless it expresses its intention to do so in explicit terms or makes the inference irresistible (Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 6th Ed. pp. 244-5; 31 Vic., c. 1, s. 6 (23) ), we are of the opinion that s. 36 of the Dominion Lands Act of 1872 (s. 37 of the Act of 1879) had not the effect contended for. A direction for the omission of a reservation of gold and silver from grants of Dominion lands is not tantamount to an affirmative enactment, that the Crown\u2019s right to gold and silver shall pass by every such grant. The Crown\u2019s prerogative right is not mentioned in the section and it is not a necessary implication from its language that that right was meant to be affected by it. The direction for the omission from the grants of Dominion lands of any reservation of gold and silver may have been inofficious. It is quite probable that it did not occur to anybody at the time when s. 36 was inserted in that statute that the presence in it of the words \u201cgold, silver\u201d might give rise to such a contention as that now put forward. It would appear that when the possibility of such an implication being asserted was brought to the notice of Parliament it passed legislation declaratory of its contrary intent in the unmistakeable terms to which reference has been made (s. 43 of c. 17 of 46 Vic.).\nThere is nothing in this course of legislation which, in our opinion, supports the view that the precious metals (gold and silver) in Dominion lands ever passed to grantees of such lands under Crown grants thereof\u2014unless, indeed, where such grants may have contained express words apt and precise to convey them. We cannot assent to the suggestion that in accepting the provisions of the Dominion Lands Act of 1872 and of the Order in Council of the 6th of December, 1872, the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company was under the mistaken impression that it would thereby become entitled to the precious metals underlying the lands for which it might subsequently obtain grants or titles by notification under s. 21 of the statute.\nFor the foregoing reasons we are of the opinion that the series of questions referred to the Court by His Excellency the Governor General in Council should be answered as follows:\nQuestion No. 1.\nIn whom, after the acceptance of the said surrender and the passing of the said Order in Council of the 23rd day of June, 1870, were vested the precious metals, gold and silver, in, under or upon, the lands in the said area possessed and occupied at the date of the said surrender as posts or stations of the Company, its officers or agents, whether in the Crown represented by the Dominion of Canada, or in the Company?\nAnswer: In the Crown.\nQuestion No. 2.\nIn whom were vested the precious metals, gold and silver, in, under or upon the blocks of land adjoining the said posts or stations of the Company and selected by the Company, whether in the Crown represented by the Dominion of Canada, or in the Company:\n(a) Upon the selection by the Company of the said blocks of land;\n(b) Upon the issue to the Company of the Crown patents for the said blocks of land?\nAnswer: (a) In the Crown;\n(b) In the Crown. Question No. 3.\nIn whom were vested the precious metals, gold and silver, in, under, or upon, the sections of lands or parts thereof in the said fertile belt which were vested in the Company by notification, upon such notification, whether in the Crown represented by the Dominion of Canada, or in the Company?\nAnswer: In the Crown.\nQuestion No. 4.\nIn whom were vested the precious metals, gold and silver, in, under or upon, the land granted to the Company by letters patent from the Crown upon the issue thereof:\n(a) In satisfaction of the Company\u2019s one-twentieth of the land in the fractional townships, or in the townships broken by lakes;\n(b) In lieu of lands allotted to the Company but found to be settled upon?\nAnswer: (a) In the Crown;\n(b) In the Crown.\nQuestion No. 5.\nIn whom were vested the precious metals, gold and silver, in, under or upon, the lands granted to the Company by letters patent in lieu of land in which the Company relinquished and surrendered its rights to the Crown upon the issue of such patents?\nAnswer: In the Crown.\nQuestion No. 6.\nIn whom were vested the precious metals, gold and silver, in, under or upon, the land granted to the Company by letters patent in lieu of land conveyed by the Company to the Crown upon the issue of such patents?\nAnswer: In the Crown.\nQuestion No. 7.\nIf in any of such cases the precious metals, gold and silver, were vested in the Company, did the repeal of section 37 of the Dominion Lands Act, 1879, Chapter 31 of 42 Victoria, by section 6 of chapter 26 of 43 Victoria, or the enactment of section 43 of chapter 17 of 46 Victoria, or of the Dominion Lands Act, chapter 20 of 7 and 8 Edward VII, or any other enactment affect the ownership of the said precious metals in such case?\nAnswer: The hypothesis of this question does not arise.\nQuestions referred answered accordingly.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General of Canada: W.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1] dismissing an appeal by the present appellant from the judgment of Harris C.J.1 in favour of the respondent in an action brought by the respondent on a fire insurance policy issued by the appellant. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nThe statutory condition contained in the policy and quoted and dealt with in the judgment is the 9th statutory condition in the first schedule to The Fire Insurance Policies\u2019 Act, R.S.N.S., 1923, c. 211.\nC. J. Burchell K.C. and J. A. Hanway K.C. for the appellant.\nW. A. Livingstone for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014This is an appeal from the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc1, dismissing an appeal brought by this appellant from the judgment of Harris C.J.1, who awarded the respondent $8,000 on a fire insurance policy issued by the appellant.\nIn December, 1923, the respondent effected an insurance against fire with the appellant on a building owned by him at Digby, N.S., and occupied as a garage and dwelling. The policy ran from December 10, 1923, to December 10, 1924, and was for $8,000. On December 3, 1924, the building was greatly damaged by fire, and it is not contended that the loss did not equal the amount insured. The policy contained the following statutory condition:\nThe insurer is not liable for loss if there is any prior insurance with any other insurer, unless the insurer\u2019s assent to such prior insurance appears in the policy or is endorsed thereon, nor if any subsequent insurance is effected with any other insurer, unless and until the insurer assents thereto, or unless the insurer does not dissent in writing within two weeks after receiving written notice of the intention or desire to effect the subsequent insurance, or does not dissent in writing after that time and before the subsequent or further insurance is effected.\nIn November, 1924, the appellant obtained a fire insurance policy from the Northern Assurance Company, Limited, London, England, which I will call the Northern Company, for $4,000, being $3,000 on his building and $1,000 on his furniture. This policy was made subject to the same statutory condition.\nAfter the fire, the respondent brought actions against both companies, the action against the Northern Company being apparently the first in time. The plea of the Northern Company is not in the record, but I understood from counsel that, in addition to other defences, the Northern Company disputed liability on two grounds: 1, that the plaintiff had prior insurance with the present appellant, to which the assent of the Northern Company had not been secured; 2, that the plaintiff had failed to disclose to the defendant that, when he obtained insurance from the appellant, he had applied for $12,000 insurance, but was informed that $8,000 only could be placed on the property.\nOn the second ground Mr. Justice Mellish dismissed the action against the Northern Company, although he did not find the plaintiff\u2019s conduct fraudulent. He decided that the policy of the Northern Company had never attached, and that the plaintiff\u2019s premium should be returned to him.\nIn answer to this action of the respondent against the present appellant, the latter set up the same statutory condition and claimed that its policy had become void by reason of the subsequent insurance with the Northern Company.\nThe only question to be decided on this appeal is whether any such subsequent insurance was effected within the meaning of the condition.\nThe respondent\u2019s answer is that the policy with the latter company never attached and therefore that no subsequent insurance was effected. He relies, and the judgments in his favour were based, on the decision of the Judicial Committee in Equitable Fire and Accident Office, Limited v. The Ching Wo Hong[2].\nIn that case the company disputed liability because, it alleged, an additional insurance had been effected in violation of a condition of the policy which stated that no additional insurance was allowed except by consent of the company. The insured had obtained from another insurer a policy of insurance containing a condition that the insurance would not be in force, nor would the company be liable in respect of any loss or damage, before the premium, or a deposit on account thereof, was actually paid. No premium had been paid and the insured did not attempt to collect the insurance. Their Lordships, speaking by Lord Davey, were of opinion that the second insurance had never become effective, and that therefore the condition of the policy sued on had not been infringed.\nThe appellant relies on several Canadian cases in support of its contention that the mere fact that the respondent obtained subsequently a policy of insurance, however void, annuls its contract of insurance under the statutory condition of its policy. It cites the following language of Mr. Justice Sedgwick, speaking for this Court, in Manitoba Assurance Co. v. Whitla[3]:\nSo far as the Manitoba Assurance Co. is .concerned it seems to me that there can be but little question as to its non-liability. The effecting of the new insurance in the Royal Co. without its assent gave it the right at its option to void it, and, as has been established by a long series of cases in Canadian courts, whether the new insurance was in the first event valid or invalid, if there was a new contract of insurance in fact, that de facto second insurance made void the first.\nI think this language can no longer be considered as binding in view of the decision of the Privy Council in Equitable Fire and Accident Office, Limited v. The Ching Wo Hong (ubi supra)[4]. The question to my mind is whether, within the meaning of the statutory condition, \u201cany subsequent insurance was effected with any other insurer.\u201d The policy of the Northern Company never attached. Its statutory condition expressly provided that \u201cthe insurer is not liable for loss if there is any prior insurance with any other insurer,\u201d etc, so that, if there was such prior insurance, the condition applied, and no insurance under the policy was effected. The condition of the appellant\u2019s policy does not contemplate a subsequent contract of insurance in fact, but a subsequent insurance which is effective. That is precisely what the Northern Company\u2019s contract never was. The attempt now to vivify this contract so as to relieve the appellant from liability, in my opinion, must fail.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: James A.

R. 551) that the action was rightly dismissed, in view of s. 199 of the Assessment Act, R.S.M. 1913, c. 134, as amended (as now found in s. 198 of c. 134 of the Consolidated Amendments, 1924), over a year having elapsed since the sale and the treasurer\u2019s return having been made to the district registrar.\nIf the land was liable for some portion of the taxes for which it was sold, the ground, left open for setting aside a tax sale under said s. 199, as amended, \u201cthat the land was not liable for the taxes, or any portion thereof, for which the same was sold\u201d is inapplicable.\nHistory of the legislation reviewed; Can.

APPEAL[1] from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[2] affirming the judgment of Mathers C.J. K.B.[3] dismissing the appellant\u2019s action to set aside a tax sale of land by the defendant municipality to the defendant Joyal. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nE. K. Williams K.C. and E. F. Newcombe for the appellant.\nD. H. Laird K.C. for the respondent municipality.\nC. H. Locke K.C. for the respondent Joyal.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014Houghton Land Corporation Limited brought this action to annul the sale of a parcel of land by the Rural Municipality of Ritchot to Joseph Joyal. The plaintiff sought to set aside the sale not only as against the municipality but also as against Joyal.\nThe land was sold for taxes entered on the collector\u2019s rolls of the municipality for the years 1920 and 1921. The Houghton company alleged that certain amounts were wrongfully added on the rolls \u201cto the taxes properly payable\u201d upon the land for the year 1920 and that the effect was to invalidate the sale.\nThe amounts to which objection was taken came to be due as follows:\u2014\nIn 1920, one Edward G. McGee was in possession of the land under an agreement for sale from the company. Some time during the year, the municipality, without the knowledge or consent of the company, advanced to McGee seed grain for the farm to the value of $389.81 and bored a well at a cost of $14.0.70. The municipality took McGee\u2019s note for the seed grain account. Under the Seed Grain Act (R.S.M. 1913, c. 178, s. 23),\nThe amount of * * * such promissory note * * * may be entered in the collector\u2019s roll of the municipality against any land therein owned by the maker of such note, and thereafter the amount of such note and interest thereon shall be held to be taxes due and in arrear against such land as if duly levied and in arrear under the provisions of \u201cThe Assessment Act.\u201d\nLikewise, under s. 473 of the Municipal Act,\nWhere a municipality * * * sinks a private well * * * upon lands * * * at the request of the owners of such lands, the amount of the total cost of doing any such work may foe collected by the Municipality from the respective owners of the land upon which the said work has been performed, in the same manner and to the same extent as ordinary taxes, and all such amounts, if not paid on demand, shall be entered as extra taxes against the lands of such owners respectively in the then current Collector\u2019s Roll of the Municipality and be collectable as if levied under \u201cThe Assessment Act.\u201d\nThe point taken by the appellant is that McGee was not the \u201cowner\u201d within the meaning of this legislation and that these advances, made at his sole request, were not therefore properly chargeable against the land.\nThe decision of that point involved the interpretation of the agreement between the Houghton Land Corporation and McGee and the construction of the relevant sections of the Seed Grain Act and the Municipal Act. Following its own previous judgment in Leistikow v. Municipality of Ritchot[4], the Court of Appeal of Manitoba, Perdue C.J. dissenting, confirmed Mathers C.J., who decided against the company\u2019s contention and dismissed the action. Dennistoun J.A., however, with whom Fullerton J.A. concurred, also based his judgment upon s. 199 of the Assessment Act (R.S.M. 1913, c. 134), which he held applicable in the circumstances.\nIn our view, this section is sufficient to dispose of the action, without the necessity of construing the other Acts and the agreement.\nThe sale took place on the 27th day of October, 1922. The action was brought only on the 3rd January, 1924\u2014 or more than a year after.\nUnder the Manitoba statute, the municipality does not issue a tax sale deed, but a certificate of the sale is delivered to the purchaser; and, if the land is not redeemed within one year thereafter, the treasurer of the municipality forwards to the district registrar for the land titles district in which the land lies a return \u201cshowing all lands which were sold * * * and which have not been redeemed, the persons to whom sold, the amounts at which the lands were sold,\u201d etc. The purchaser then has the right to apply to the registrar for title to the land. A notice must be given to all persons interested, who have a further opportunity to redeem; and, if redemption is not made, or the proceedings are not stayed, a certificate of title under The Real Property Act, clear of all encumbrances, issues to the purchaser.\nIn this case, the treasurer made his return in due course to the district registrar and, in November, 1923, Joyal launched his application for title, when certificate of lis pendens was issued and filed by the present plaintiff.\nSection 199 of R.S.M. 1913, c. 134, as now found in the Consolidated Amendments of 1924, c. 134, s. 198, is as follows:\u2014\n(1) Upon the expiration of one year from the day of sale, and thereafter unless and until the land is redeemed, the tax purchaser or his assignee shall, in all suits or proceedings wherein such tax sale is questioned, be prima facie deemed to be owner of the land.\n(2) Upon the expiration of said period of one year the treasurer\u2019s return to the district registrar hereinafter provided for shall in any proceedings in any court in this province, and for the purpose of proving title under The Real Property Act, be, except as hereinafter provided conclusive evidence of the validity of the assessment of the land, the levy of the rate, the sale of the land for taxes and all other proceedings leading up to such sale and that the land was not redeemed at the end of said period of one year; and, notwithstanding any defect in such assessment, levy, sale or other proceedings, no such tax sale shall be annulled or set aside except upon the following grounds and no other; that the sale was not conducted in a fair and open manner, or that the taxes for the year or years for which the land was sold had been paid or that the land was not liable for the taxes, or any portion thereof, for which the same was sold.\nThe words: \u201cor that the land was not liable for the taxes, or any portion thereof, for which the same was sold\u201d are not as clear as could be desired. They are possibly susceptible of being construed as meaning: \u201cIf any of the taxes for which the land was sold were wrongfully charged, that is a ground for setting aside the sale.\u201d\nWe think, however, those words mean: \u201cThe sale cannot be set aside, if the land was liable for some portion of the taxes for which it was sold.\u201d Such was the construction put upon them by Dennistoun J.A. and Fullerton J.A., with whom we agree.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba in Canadian Northern Ry. v. Rural Municipality of Springfield[5] is illuminative on this point. In that case, land had been sold for taxes for the years 1910 and 1911. It was contended that the taxes had been properly imposed for 1910, but improperly imposed for 1911, and the court so found. Cameron J.A. delivered the judgment and gave as follows, the history of the legislation:\u2014\nIn the Revised Statutes of 1892, sec. 191, ch. 101, the words setting forth the grounds on which, and no other, a tax sale could be set aside were these:\n\u201cThat the sale has not been conducted in a fair, open and proper manner; or that there were no taxes due and in arrears upon such land at the time of said sale for which the same could be sold.\u201d\nThe issue of tax-sale deeds by municipalities was abolished and a new method of making title to land sold at tax sales by application to the district registrar was instituted in 1894 by sec. 5, ch. 21, 57 Vict. The district registrar was authorized and bound to proceed in the manner therein prescribed, and issue a certificate of title unless it was shown to his satisfaction that the land was not liable for \u201cthe taxes or any portion of the taxes for which the same was sold.\u201d This last-mentioned section was repealed by sec. 1 of ch. 21, 60 Vict. (1897) and a new set of sections substituted. By subsec. (9) of said sec. 1, the district registrar was bound to issue a certificate unless it was shown to him that the land was not liable for \u201cany portion of the taxes for which the same was sold.\u201d This latest-mentioned section was in its turn repealed by sec. 12, ch. 35, 63-64 Vict. (1900), and another series of subsections substituted, and in subsec. (16) there are set out the only grounds upon which a tax sale can be annulled or set aside, in these words:\n\u201cThat the sale was not conducted in a fair and open manner, or that the taxes for the year or years for which the land was sold had been paid or that the land was not liable for taxation for the year or (years for which it was sold.\u201d\nThese words were carried into the 1902 revision, ch. 117, sec. 202, and appear in the revision of 1913, sec. 199, ch. 134.\nThe learned judge then goes on to say:\u2014\nIt appears, therefore, that the words of sec. 199 on which the solution of the question before us depends have been on the statute book since 1900 only. Decisions of our Courts on the validity of tax-sale proceedings prior to that time have, therefore, little application. Apparently if the legislation, above referred to, enacted in 1894 or in 1897, had remained in force, there could have been no question as to the validity of the sale before us. But the wording of sec. 199 is different, and no doubt designedly so, and it is now open to an owner to impeach a tax sale on the ground that the land was not liable to taxation during the year or years for which it was sold. The land in this case was sold for taxes for the years 1910 and 1911, and it was not liable to taxation for those years, but only for one of them.\nThe holding of the Court was that a tax sale is invalid \u201cfor every purpose unless the property was at the time liable for all the taxes for which it was sold.\u201d\nThis judgment was rendered on the 1st December, 1919 At the session immediately following the judgment, the Legislature of Manitoba amended s. 199 of c 134 of the Revised Statutes of 1913. (See Manitoba Statute, 10 Geo. V, c. 84, s. 20). It struck out the words: \u201cor that the land was not liable to taxation for the year or years for which it was sold,\u201d on account of which the Court of Appeal had declared the sale invalid in the Springfield case. For these words the Legislature substituted the wording, as we have it now in the section applicable to the present case: \u201cor that the land was not liable for the taxes, or any portion thereof, for which the same was sold.\u201d\nIt is, we think, of the utmost significance that these latter words are precisely those of the legislation of 1894, as to which in Canadian Northern Ry. v. Springfield[6], the) Court of Appeal had stated that, had the law been so expressed, \u201cthere could have been no question as to the validity of the sale.\u201d\nWe thus have the Legislature of Manitoba, for the purpose of putting beyond question the validity of sales made for taxes by municipalities, adopting the very words which are now before us in s. 199, as it stood at the material dates of this case, apparently intending them to bear the construction put upon them by the highest court of the province. In our opinion, therefore, the interpretation of the section by Dennistoun and Fullerton JJ. A. was fully justified.\nWhen the present action was brought, more than a year had elapsed since the date of the sale, and the treasurer\u2019s return had been forwarded to the district registrar. The Houghton company did not charge \u201cany irregularities of machinery.\u201d It did not attack the proceedings of the sale, far less did it invoke any \u201csubstantial or fundamental defects\u201d precluding the application of the section as was the case in Standard Trusts Co. v. Municipality of Hiram[7]. It was urged later, although not made a ground of complaint in the statement of claim, that the collector\u2019s roll was altered and the name of McGee substituted as owner for that of the appellant. That is based entirely on conjectures. In the absence of any evidence that the change was improperly made, the contrary must be presumed. If the appellant wished to invoke this as an irregularity, it was upon it to show the circumstances. The former secretary-treasurer, Gauthier, who prepared the roll and made the change, was a witness in the case. No question whatever was put to him concerning this entry.\nThe only grievance against the sale is that the seed grain and the well accounts should not have been added on the collector\u2019s roll. None of the grounds set forth in section 199 were invoked here. There being no reason to preclude the application of the section, \u201cno other\u201d ground could be entertained by the courts of Manitoba for the purpose of annulling the sale, after the expiration of one year and after the treasurer had made his return to the district registrar. It is admitted that the land was liable for a large portion of the taxes for which it was sold. This under the statute is sufficient. With such a provision in the law, the decided cases to the effect that the inclusion in a tax sale proceeding of any unlawful amount renders the whole sale void are clearly inapplicable.\nWe must deal with this case purely and simply as an action to set aside the tax sale, irrespectively of the right of redemption or of any other recourse by the Houghton Land Corporation against the municipality, as to which we express no opinion. We think, in view of s. 199, the sale to Joyal must stand.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. The respondent Joyal should have his costs against the appellant.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. Browne-Wilkinson.\nSolicitors for the respondent municipality: Munson, Allan, Laird, Davis, Haffner and Hobkirk.\nSolicitor for the respondent Joyal: C. M. Boswell.\n[1] For report of judgment dismissing a motion to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, see [1927] S.C.R. 17.\n[2] 35 Man. R. 551; [1926] 2 W.W.R. 51.\n[3] 35 Man.

One of the conditions (expressed to be conditions precedent to plaintiff\u2019s right to recover under the policy) was that \u201cThis policy may be continued in force by renewal receipt upon the company\u2019s form, and, if so continued, the material statements made in writing upon the application for this policy shall be deemed to be repeated at the time of such renewal, and to form the basis of such renewal, together with any further material statements made on the occasion of such renewal.\u201d For the purpose of a renewal, plaintiff certified to defendant that the employee \u201cduring the year * * * performed his duties faithfully and satisfactorily.

The material facts of the case are set out in the judgment of Newcombe J. now reported. The appeal was allowed with costs.\nG. Grant K.C. and S. Jenks K.C. for the appellant.\nF. H. Bell K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault and Lamont JJ. was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014I accept in full the statement of the pertinent facts made by my brother Newcombe in his judgment which I have had the advantage of reading. The policy was renewed on the faith of an express declaration, the truth of which was made a condition precedent to liability attaching, and which is shewn to have been untrue in fact. It is no answer to say that this declaration was made in good faith and in ignorance of its untruth. On the authority of Railway Passengers Assurance Co. v. Standard Life Assurance Co.[1], the appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed.\nThe judgment of Newcombe and Rinfret JJ. was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The plaintiff, respondent in this appeal, is the Housing Commission of the City of Halifax, constituted under c. 4 of 1919 of the Statutes of Nova Scotia, an Act to provide for the erection of dwelling houses and incorporation of housing companies. The defendant, appellant, is the Dominion of Canada Guarantee and Accident Company, Limited, which issued a policy dated 28th March, 1921, insuring the good conduct for one year from 18th February, 1921, of Thomas M. Hayes, who was employed by the Commission in the capacity of secretary. It was recited by the policy that the Commission had made certain statements in writing to the company in the application, and it was agreed,\nin consideration of the material statements, warranties and conditions contained in the said statements, which it is agreed shall be the basis and form part of this contract of insurance, and of the sum of $25,\nto insure the employer, in the sum of $5,000, against pecuniary loss\nby any embezzlement or theft on the part of the said employee in connection with any of the duties of the said employee mentioned in said application which shall have been discovered and notified to the company during the continuance of this agreement, or, in case of the death, dismissal or retirement of the employee, notified to the company, within three months from the death, dismissal or retirement.\nThe conditions set out are expressed to be \u201cconditions precedent to the right of the employer to recover under this policy\u201d By the 10th of these conditions it is stipulated that\nThis policy may-be continued in force by renewal receipt upon the company\u2019s form, and, if so continued, the material statements made in writing upon the application for this policy shall be deemed to be repeated at the time of such renewal, and to form the basis of such renewal, together with any further material statements made on the occasion of such renewal.\nThe policy was renewed in the company\u2019s form from 18th February, 1922, to 18th February, 1923, and in like manner the policy was again renewed from 18th February, 1923, to 18th February, 1924. During the latter year irregularities and embezzlement or theft on the part of the employee were discovered in connection with his duties. Deficits had been running or accumulating for a considerable period. Hayes had been in the employment of the Commission since 19th June, 1921. The city auditor at Halifax, who was discharging the duties of auditor for the Commission, discovered in October, 1922, that he was not depositing his receipts; the auditor thought the deficiency was about $1,800, but this amount was made up, after some delay, and he did not inform the Commissioners. Hayes was suspended by resolution of the Commission of 21st August, 1923, upon report of the special auditors whom the Commission had employed to investigate his accounts, and it was directed that the defendant company should be notified of a shortage, as then found, of $3,700. The auditors, in their report of 5th October, 1923, which is one of the documents in evidence, state that:\u2014\nA reconciliation of all cash receipts and disbursements as shown by the Cash Book with the deposits and withdrawals as shown by the Bank statements, disclosed the fact that all cash entered in the Cash Book up to October 31, 1922, had not been deposited in the bank as received. The under-deposit in bank was apparently made up in November, 1922, during which month the deposits were approximately $3,300 in excess of the receipts shown by the Cash Book. We understand that the additional deposits were made as the result of the insistence of the City Auditor that the bank deposits should be brought lip to date, but so far as we can ascertain the matter was not reported to the Commission.\nIt appears, however, from a statement of moneys received by Hayes, which have not been restored, that these include receipts month by month from August, 1922, until August, 1923.\nAt the trial the plaintiff recovered $3,851.85, and there is an appeal per saltum to this Court. The learned trial judge found that the plaintiff Commission had no knowledge of the dishonesty of Hayes until the special auditors made their resport in August, 1923, and it was upon this finding that the judgment proceeded.\nNow it is not disputed that the Commission had not been informed of any of these deficits or irregularities, and it is admitted that there is no evidence of fraud against it. My difficulty about the case arises from the contract, and some additional facts which I am going to mention.\nFor the purposes of the first renewal, Mr. Brookfield, the Chairman of the Commission, certified to the company, under date of 20th February, 1922:\u2014\nBond No. 058054.\nI certify that Thomas M. Hayes, of Halifax, N.S., has, during the year ended on the 18th day of February, 1922, performed his duties faithfully and satisfactorily. He is not at present in arrears or default. His accounts have been examined up to the 1st day of December, 1921. and found correct. The examination was made by W. W. Foster, City Auditor, Halifax, N.S.\nI know nothing of any habit or past deportment unfavourably affecting his title to general confidence, or why suretyship guaranteeing his honesty should not be granted to him.\nAnd, when the policy came to be renewed the second time, Mr. Healey, the Vice-Chairman of the Commission, gave a certificate to the company, dated 21st February, 1923, in the same terms, with reference to the year ended 18th February, 1923, mentioning 17th February of that year as the date up to which the accounts had been examined by the city auditor. Now according to my interpretation of the contract, these certificates are intended to operate under the 10th clause which I have quoted, and in which it is provided that, if the policy be continued upon the company\u2019s form, as it was on both these occasions, the material statements made in writing upon the application, \u201ctogether with any further material statements made on the occasion of such renewal,\u201d shall form the basis of such renewal. I am unable to escape the conclusion that the certificates must be regarded as \u201cfurther material statements\u201d within the meaning of this clause, and therefore they go to \u201cconstitute the basis of the renewals. It is stated explicitly that \u201cHe is not at present in arrears or default.\u201d This is the language of warranty. At the argument I was inclined to think that the words might, in the light of the circumstances and context, be held to go no further than the information and belief of the officer who signed, and I was not indisposed to yield to the view that, inasmuch as an employee might be dishonest and would, if he misappropriated money of his employer, endeavour to conceal it, and as therefore there might be default or arrears for the preceding year which had not been discovered, and against which it was a stipulated purpose of the expiring policy to indemnify, it could not reasonably be supposed that the insurer would exact an absolute undertaking, or that the insured would assent to it, or that the Commission, in order to have a renewal of the policy, would make a representation opposed to its right to recover for losses already incurred; the undertaking construed in its strict sense seems to be unreasonable. But, after more careful consideration, the contract of the parties seems to be plainly expressed, and I have come to the conclusion that it admits of only one interpretation. Hayes was in arrears and default on both occasions when these certificates were made. A material condition of the contract was not satisfied. Good faith, even of the utmost, is no defence against a breach of warranty.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L. A. Lovett.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F. H. Bell.\n[1] (1921) 63 Can. S.C.R. 79.\n",

Macneil, [1927] S.C.R. 497\nDate: 1927-06-17\nThe Acadia Coal Company, Limited (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nAngus MacNeil (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1927: May 12; 1927: June 17.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Newcombe, Rinfret and Lamont JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA EN BANC\nNegligence\u2014Railways\u2014Children walking on tracks killed by train\u2014 Licensees\u2014Duty of railway company\u2014Statutory prohibition to walk on tracks\u2014Nova Scotia Railways Act, R.S.N.S. 1923, c. 180, s. 268 (1).\nPlaintiff occupied a house belonging to defendant in its railway yard. Defendant\u2019s train, while working in the yard, ran over and killed two of plaintiff\u2019s children who were walking on the tracks on their way to school. The train was moving reversely and there was no one on the car in front to look out. Plaintiff sued for compensation under The Fatal Injurien Act, R.S.N.S. 1923, c. 229. The jury found, among other things, that the children were on the tracks by defendant\u2019s permission, and that the accident was caused by defendant\u2019s negligence, and judgment was entered for plaintiff for damages, which was affirmed on appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc (59 N.S. Rep. 154). On appeal to this Court it was urged that, by reason of the prohibition in s. 268 (1) of The Nova Scotia Railways Act (R.S.N.S. 1923, c. 180) to walk upon the tracks, there could be no lawful permission granted by defendant, and, moreover, that, if the permission found were in any way effective, it conferred on the children no rights beyond those of bare licensees, and therefore there was, in the circumstances, no negligence, as defendant did nothing other than to carry on its shunting operations within its yard in the ordinary and usual manner.\nHeld, that the judgment below should be sustained; conduct which is negligence does not cease to be so if or because it is ordinary and usual; the children\u2019s presence on the tracks by defendant\u2019s permission was an element which should have influenced the operation of the train; defendant was bound to use ordinary care not to run over them, and that duty it did not fulfil; s. 268 (1) of The Nova Scotia Railways Act did not affect the case; the decisions in G.T.R. v. Anderson (28 Can. S.C.R. 541) and Maritime Coal, etc., Co. v. Herdman (59 Can. S.C.R. 127), while governing in identical cases, should not be extended; the statutory prohibition should not be taken to have the effect of relieving a railway company from liability for damages caused by negligent operation to persons who would have been entitled in the absence of the clause; if it applied to the children, and if, as found, they had permission to walk along the tracks, defendant ought not ta be allowed to maintain trespass against them contrary to the fact, or to escape the responsibility which it incurred by its agreement to treat them as licensees; moreover, the children being only seven and nine years of age, and there being no finding as to their capacity for crime, the case could not foe treated upon the footing that they were bound by the statute, nor could the principle that knowledge of the law is presumed be invoked against them.\nAPPEAL by the defendant (by special leave granted by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc) from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1] dismissing its appeal from the judgment entered upon the findings of the jury, in an action, tried before Carroll J. with a jury, to recover from the defendant compensation to the plaintiff and his wife under The Fatal Injuries Act, R.S.N.S. 1923, c. 229, for the death of two children of the plaintiff who were run over and killed by a train belonging to the defendant. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nS. Jenks K.C. and H. Ross K.C. for the appellant.\nR. Douglas Graham and J. Doull for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The Acadia Coal Co. Ltd., engaged in the business of coal mining in Pictou Co., Nova Scotia, operates in connection with its mines, a railway at the town of Stellerton, under the authority of The Nova Scotia Railways Act, R.S.N.S., 1923, c. 180. It is the defendant and appellant in this action. Angus MacNeil, the plaintiff, is a coal miner in the employ of the company, and, at the time of the accident, was, and had been for several years, occupying with his family, a miner\u2019s house belonging to the company which was situate in the company\u2019s railway yard, near the entrance of the Allan shaft of the company\u2019s workings at Stellerton. At about, or shortly before, nine o\u2019clock in the morning of 1st December, 1924, a train belonging to the company, in charge of its employees, which was working in the yard, ran over and killed two of the plaintiff\u2019s children, Frank and Evelyn, aged respectively seven and nine years, who were passing through the yard on their way to school. The action is brought to recover compensation under The Fatal Injuries Act, R.S.N.S., 1923, c. 229. The important facts are not in dispute. The plaintiff\u2019s house is situate a short distance to the eastward of the most southerly of the tracks. The school which the children attended is to the northward, somewhat beyond the northern limit of the yard, and there is a trail or roadway, leading northwesterly from the house in the direction of the school, which crosses the tracks at a considerable distance from the house and connects with the highway from Stellerton to New Glasgow. It was the habit of the children generally, when late for school, to walk along the tracks from this crossing, as by that way the distance was shorter and they found better walking. On the morning in question they were somewhat late and, approaching the crossing, they turned off the trail to the northward, pursuing their usual course. They were accompanied by an elder sister thirteen years of age. The morning was clear, but there had been a fall of several inches of snow the night before. While the children were on their way, a light shunting locomotive came down the main track of the yard from the northward, passing a switch which is situate between the place of the accident and the crossing. Here the engine stopped and backed into no. 2 track, which runs thence in a northwesterly direction from the main track. On this branch track or siding the tender of the engine was hooked to a large car which is thus described in the evidence:\u2014\nQ. When you got up there did you hook on some cars?\u2014A. We hooked on one car.\nQ. That is on to the tender end of your engine?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. What would that be, a big gondola?\u2014A. Yes, i call it an iron car.\nQ. It is a large coal box car?\u2014A. It is an open car.\nQ. It is one of the large varieties?\u2014A. It is a 50-ton car.\nThen the engine, thus connected with car, moved forward again on to the main line, passing the switch, where it reversed and proceeded again to the northward upon the main line and continued thereon, headed by the car, until it ran over the children, who were then walking on this line, going northward to school. Wilda MacNeil, the eldest of the three, was thrown from the track and injured, but the two small children who were ahead, walking hand in hand, were both killed. There were a conductor, engineman and fireman on the train, and when the engine was coming down the main track, going southerly, the conductor, who was in charge, and the fireman had seen the three children on their way, going northward in the yard, near the railway, on the east side. Cummings, the conductor, gives the following evidence:\u2014\nQ. When going down and standing on the front of the engine did you see the MacNeil children?\u2014A. Yes, I saw the MacNeil children.\nQ. That is the little boy, Frank, and Evelyn and Wilda?\u2014A. Yes, I saw the three of them.\nQ. You knew the children, you were familiar with them?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You knew where they lived?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. I suppose you would be seeing them in the course of your duty nearly every day?\u2014A. Mostly every day, yes.\nQ. You would be shunting back and forth there?\u2014A. Yes, most of the time.\nQ. The weigh scales are quite handy the MacNeil house almost; opposite?\u2014A. Yes, not far from it.\nThe trouble seems to have been that the large car, which was at the head of the train, obstructed the view of the tracks from the engine, and there was no one on the car to look out. The conductor, instead of going to the front of the car, when the train started to move northerly from the switch, as he should have done, says, speaking of this occasion:\u2014\nQ. Then what happened, did you get on the train?\u2014A. I got on the engine, on the side of it.\nQ. What do you call that, the steps into the cab?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. When you got on the engine you would then be on the western side of the engine, that is north looking towards New Glasgow, you would be on the western side of the engine?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. The side on which you had seen the children would be the other side, the eastern side?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. When you were then in that position your train would be running reversely?\u2014A. Yes, tender first.\nQ. And in front of your tender was your gondola car?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Was there any person standing on the front end of the gondola car?\u2014A. No.\nIn another place he explains that he got on the engine in order to give instructions to the engineman as to what was to be done with the car which they were shunting, and it was while he was in conversation with the engineman in the cabin of the locomotive that they felt the shock and realized that an accident had happened.\nThere was a jury in the case and the learned judge, at the conclusion of his charge, to which no objection is taken before us, submitted questions which the jury answered. The substance of the findings is that the accident was caused by the negligence of the company, which consisted in the fact that the conductor, knowing children to be in the vicinity, should have given his engineer instructions, if necessary, before putting his train in motion, and should have taken his place on the gondola, where he could have kept a lookout; that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the deceased children; that, if there were contributory negligence on their part, the defendant could have avoided the accident by the exercise of ordinary care; that the children were at the time of the accident upon the track of the defendant company by permission of the company; that up to the time of the accident the public habitually travelled along the route taken by the children on the morning of their death; that the defendant company had knowledge thereof; and that the damages were $1,250, of which $250 were allowed to the father and $1,000 to the mother. Upon these findings judgment was entered for the plaintiff.\nUpon appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc the usual objections were taken. It was alleged that the findings were against the evidence, perverse and unreasonable; that evidence had been improperly received and rejected, and that there was misdirection. A question had been raised at the trial as to the effect of ss. 1 of s. 268 of The Nova Scotia Railways Act, which provides that:\nEvery person, not connected with the railway, or employed by the company, who walks along the track thereof, except where the same is laid across or along a highway, is liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding ten dollars.\nAnd it was contended that the children must therefore be treated for the purposes of this action as trespassers.\nThe appeal was heard, en banc; the judges were Chisholm, Mellish and Graham JJ., and the appeal was dismissed. Upon the question of contributory negligence Mellish J., who pronounced the judgment, said that there was sufficient evidence that the defendant by the exercise of ordinary care could have avoided the accident, notwithstanding any negligence on the part of the children, and that the real cause of the accident was the negligence of defendant\u2019s servants in keeping no lookout, in which case there was no room for a finding of contributory negligence.\nUpon the appeal to this Court two questions only were pressed. It was urged that, by reason of the statutory prohibition to walk upon the tracks, there could be no lawful permission granted by the company, and the appellant relied upon the cases of Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Anderson[2], and Maritime Coal, etc., Co. v. Herdman[3]. It was contended, moreover, that, if the permission found were in any way effective, it conferred upon the children no rights beyond those of bare licensees, and therefore there was, in the circumstances, no negligence, for it was said that the appellant did nothing other than to carry on its shunting operations within its railway yard in the ordinary and usual manner.\nI do not think, however, that conduct, which is negligent, ceases to be so, if, or because, it is ordinary and usual. The presence of the children upon the tracks by the company\u2019s permission was an element in the situation which should have influenced the operation of the train, but which seems to have been entirely disregarded. I cannot escape the conclusion that the appellant company owed a duty to the children which, in order to maintain the present judgment, need be put no higher than this, that the company, in the operation of its train upon the track which the children were using by its consent, was bound to use ordinary care not to run over them, and that duty it did not fulfil.\nThe house in which the plaintiff lived with his family was in the defendant\u2019s railway yard. It was not reached by any highway, and the father had to pass through the yard to reach the shaft. His children likewise, if they went to school, had to cross the yard, and could conveniently go by the way which they were using at the time of the accident; this necessarily brought them upon the tracks. There were no signs, fences, or obstructions anywhere in the locality to direct the children in their course or to prevent them choosing their own course. I do not suppose that the family were obliged to live where they did. What the plaintiff says is that he formerly, while in the appellant\u2019s employ, lived at Westville, but that he went to the company and rented this house. \u201cI was trying to get a house down there and this is the house they gave me.\u201d That was the situation in which the family was placed and which it was permitted to occupy. The children would naturally take the most convenient way, and if they took the more direct route, which they were following when the accident occurred, as was natural and not unusual, they came to a place where their way took them upon the tracks. In these circumstances the appellant\u2019s employees projected a blind train to follow the children reversely upon the track which they were pursuing, when they should reasonably have known that the children were there, and that no opportunity could be afforded to see or to warn them, or to stop, if necessary to avoid an accident. This sort of conduct, in the circumstances, is unreasonable and may, I think, be described as negligence of a grave character. One sees in the evidence a case for the application of a very just observation by Mellish J., in delivering the judgment of the Court below, when he said that \u201ca railway company, notwithstanding the duty of all persons not to go upon its line, may so use its premises by not fencing them or otherwise as to practically invite children to use them.\u201d\nThe jury is upheld by the Court of Appeal in its finding that permission of the company to use the tracks is to be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case, and we cannot justifiably set aside this concurrent finding. Indeed the fact of permission is, as intimated at the hearing, accepted by the appellant for the purposes of the appeal, and therefore, apart from the statute, there is liability.\nAs to the statute, I do not consider that it affects the case. The decisions of this Court in Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Anderson[4], and Maritime Coal, etc., Co. v. Herdman[5], to which we are referred, would govern in identical cases, but in my view of the law, I am not disposed to extend them. It seems unlikely that the subsection is framed with the intention of relieving the railway company from the consequences of negligent operation, or from liability for damages thereby caused to persons who would have been entitled in the absence of the clause. If it applied to the children who were killed, and if, as found by the jury, they had permission to walk along the tracks, the company ought not to be allowed to maintain trespass against them contrary to the fact, or to escape the responsibility which it incurred by its agreement to treat them as licensees. There are, I think, as said by Lord Sumner, with reference to a New Zealand statute, in Rex v. Broad[6], cogent reasons for thinking that the subsection was framed alio intuitu. The present case is, however, readily distinguishable. Children aged seven and nine years have by the common law the benefit of something in the nature of a presumption that they have not sufficient capacity to know that they are doing wrong. The presumption, it is true, may be rebutted by evidence; but although the parents of the children, when endeavouring to establish a case for damages, testified that their children were bright and intelligent, the defendant company neglected at the trial to obtain a finding as to their capacity for crime, and I do not think that we would be justified to make such a finding. Therefore the case cannot be treated upon the footing that they were bound by the statute, or that the principle that knowledge of the law is presumed can be invoked against them. The provision of the Criminal Code of Canada as to the competency of young persons is to be found in s. 18 of the Criminal Code, which is thus expressed:\u2014\nNo person shall be convicted of an offence by reason of an act or omission of such person when of the age of seven, but under the age of fourteen years, unless he was competent to know the nature and consequences of his conduct and to appreciate that it was wrong.\nFor the reasons stated above, and in the judgment of the Court en banc, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Hugh Ross.\nSolicitor for the respondent: R.

The jury found that defendant was guilty of negligence causing the accident, its negligence being \u201cwhistle not blown at whistling post, maintaining banks that obstruct view of train coming from south\u201d; that R. was guilty of contributory negligence, being \u201cpartially to blame in neglecting to ascertain the time that train was due at crossing,\u201d his degree of fault being 25 per cent.; and that C. was not guilty of contributory negligence. Judgment was rendered, on the findings, for damages, those of R. being 75 per cent. of his total damages assessed. The Appellate Division, Ont. (59 Ont. L.R. 396) reversed the judgment, holding that the evidence was overwhelming that the whistle was blown, and it was a proper case to interfere with the jury\u2019s finding; that the maintaining of the bank in its original or heightened condition was not negligence in law; and that the whole cause of the accident was the negligence of R. and C. and another occupant of the car. R. and C. appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The evidence was not so overwhelmingly in favour of the view that the whistle was blown at the whistling post that the judgment which set aside the jury\u2019s finding to the contrary should be sustained (Laporte v. C.P.R. [1924] S.C.R. 278). As to the bank, even if its existence along the railway, caused by the cutting made through a hill and any necessary cleaning out of the ditch, and, in normal cleaning, the throwing of materials on the side of the bank, increasing its height, could be regarded as negligence in law, there was no foundation in fact for the finding that it obstructed the view of a train coming from the south; what obstructed the view was the hill itself. As the wrongful finding of the latter ground of negligence against defendant (in addition to the other ground, sufficient to import liability, that the whistle was not blown at the whistling post) might have influenced the jury in their apportionment of the damages according to the degrees of fault as between R. and defendant, a new trial of R.\u2019s action was directed. Owing to the unsatisfactory character of the jury\u2019s answer as to the nature of R.\u2019s contributory negligence, the new trial should not be restricted to apportionment of damages, but should take place generally on all issues. There was nothing to justify a finding of contributory negligence against C., and the judgment at trial in her favour was restored.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] which allowed the defendant\u2019s appeal, and dismissed the plaintiff Reynolds\u2019 cross-appeal, from the judgment entered at trial upon the findings of the jury, in actions brought, one by Reynolds and his wife, and the other by Mary Craig and Jeannette Craig, against the defendant for damages for injuries suffered by the plaintiffs by reason of the motor car in which they were riding, and which was driven by the plaintiff Reynolds, being struck by the defendant\u2019s train at a highway crossing. The actions were tried together before Grant J. and a jury. The jury found that the defendant was guilty of negligence causing the accident, its negligence being \u201cwhistle not blown at whistling post, maintaining banks that obstruct view of train coming from south\u201d; that Reynolds was guilty of contributory negligence, being \u201cpartially to blame in neglecting to ascertain the time that train was due at crossing\u201d; that the degrees of fault were: of Reynolds, 25 per cent., and of the defendant, 75 per cent.; that the other plaintiffs were not guilty of contributory negligence. Judgment was entered in favour of Reynolds for $8,175, being 75 per cent. of the total damages ($10,900) assessed to him by the jury, and in favour of Mary Craig and Jeannette Craig for $1,100 and $50 respectively, the total damages assessed to them. No damages were assessed to Mrs. Reynolds.\nOn appeal, the Appellate Division1 held that on the whole the evidence was overwhelming that the proper signals were given by defendant, and that it was a proper case for it to interfere with the jury\u2019s findings in this re- spect; that the maintaining of the bank in its original or heightened condition was not negligence in law; that the whole cause of the accident was the negligence of Reynolds and the Craigs; and the defendant\u2019s appeal was allowed and the actions dismissed. Reynolds\u2019 cross-appeal as to the finding of contributory negligence against him was dismissed.\nThe executors of the estate of the plaintiff Reynolds, who died since the trial (the executors having procured an order of revivor), and the plaintiff Mary Craig, appealed to this Court.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported.\nA.B. Cunningham K.C. for the appellants.\nW.N. Tilley K.C., A. MacMurchy K.C. and J.D. Spence for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014In this case two actions by the appellants against the Canadian Pacific Railway Company were tried together before Mr. Justice Grant and a jury. The verdict was in favour of the appellants, but was set aside by the Second Appellate Divisional Court and the actions were dismissed.\nThe plaintiff Reynolds (now represented by his executors, for he died since the trial) was driving a Ford motor car along Craig road in the county of Frontenac, on November 13, 1925, his wife occupying with him the front seat and Mrs. Mary Craig and her daughter the rear one. They all resided in the vicinity, and knew that a train of the defendant company travelling to the north would cross Craig road, at a point called Doucet\u2019s Crossing, at about half-past twelve in the afternoon, and they had left their homes shortly before that hour. The railway line (the old Kingston and Pembroke single-track railway, acquired by the defendant in 1913), immediately to the south of the crossing, passes through a cutting made in the side of a hill, the east bank of which, at the time of the accident, was said to have intercepted the view of a train coming from the south, and all the plaintiffs must have known that the crossing was dangerous. Reynolds approached the crossing without reducing his speed, which he stated was about twelve miles an hour. When he was twenty or twenty\u2011five feet from the rails, Mrs. Craig called out \u201cThere\u2019s the train.\u201d Reynolds applied the brakes, but the car had almost touched the rails when it stopped, and in Reynolds\u2019 endeavour to back it before releasing the brakes, his engine stalled, so that the front part of the car was struck by the pilot of the locomotive and the plaintiffs were injured. They all claimed damages, Reynolds and his wife in one action, and Mrs. Craig and her daughter in another.\nThree grounds of negligence were particularized: 1. that the locomotive had not whistled at the whistling post a quarter of a mile from the crossing; 2. that the bell had not rung; 3. that the persons in charge of the railway threw up or maintained an embankment on the east side of the track in a manner to obscure the view of a train coming from the south.\nThe learned trial judge instructed the jury that if they found both the plaintiffs and the defendant guilty of negligence contributing to the accident they should, under The Contributory Negligence Act, Statutes of Ontario, 1924, c. 32, apportion the total amount of the damages according to the degree in which each party was in fault.\nThe jury answered the following questions put to them by the learned trial judge:\u2014\n1. Question: Was the defendant railway guilty of negligence causing the accident?\nAnswer: Yes.\n2. Question: If so, what was that negligence; answer fully, giving every negligence?\nAnswer: Whistle not blown at whistling post, maintaining banks that obstruct view of train coming from south.\n3. Question: Could the plaintiff, Thaddeus L. Reynolds, by the exercise of reasonable care, have avoided the accident?\nAnswer: Yes.\n4. Question: If so, in what respect did he fail to exercise such reasonable care? Answer fully.\nAnswer: Partially to blame in neglecting to ascertain the time that train was due at crossing. 5. Question: Could the plaintiffs, other than T.L. Reynolds, by the exercise of reasonable care, have avoided the accident?\nAnswer: No.\nThe seventh question asked the jury to assess the total damages of each of the plaintiffs. The answer was:\u2014\nT.L. Reynolds, $10,900.\nSarah F. Reynolds. No damages given at all.\nMary Craig, $1,100.\nJeannette Craig, $50.\n8. Question: If you find that the plaintiffs, or any of them, failed to exercise reasonable care contributing to the accident, what do you find were the degrees of fault?\nAnswer: (a) of the plaintiff T.L. Reynolds\u201425 per cent.\n(b) of the other plaintiffs. Nothing.\n(c) of the defendant railway\u201475 per cent.\nThe learned trial judge called the attention of counsel to the unsatisfactory character of the answer to question 4, but neither of them asked the judge to direct the jury to reconsider their answer in order to have the matter made clear.\nOn the findings judgment was rendered in favour of Reynolds for $8,175, being 75 per cent. of his damages, and in favour of Mary Craig and Jeannette Craig for $1,100 and $50 respectively.\nThe defendant having appealed to a divisional court, the plaintiff, T.L. Reynolds, cross\u2011appealed seeking to have the finding of contributory negligence against him set aside. The main appeal was allowed and the two actions were dismissed. The cross-appeal of T.L. Reynolds was rejected.\nReynolds\u2019 executors and Mary Craig alone have appealed from this judgment. There is no appeal by Jeannette Craig.\nWith great respect, we think that the judgment of the appellate court setting aside the finding of the jury that the locomotive had not whistled at the whistling post as required by the statute cannot be sustained. Not only was there evidence, usual in such cases, that the whistle had not been blown at the statutory distance from the crossing, given by persons who deposed that they were paying attention and were in a position to hear and would have heard had it been sounded, but there was not a little confusion on the part of some of the witnesses\u2014notably Walworth, Margaret Doucet, Clow and wife, and Kenyon\u2014as to whether there had been more than one whistle signal given before the train passed over the crossing and as to whether the signal, if only one, was given at the whistling post or immediately before the accident when the train was only a few yards from the crossing. The questions whether more than one signal had in fact been given and whether a whistle signal had been sounded at the whistling post, as prescribed by the statute, could not properly have been withdrawn from the jury, and the evidence, in our opinion, is not so overwhelmingly in favour of the view that the statutory signal was given that we should sustain the judgment setting aside the jury\u2019s finding to the contrary (Laporte v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[2]) Scores of verdicts based on similar evidence have been sustained on appeal.\nAs to the other ground of negligence found by the jury, that the defendant had maintained an embankment on the east side of the railway in a manner to obscure the view of a train coming from the south,\u2014after a full hearing and consideration of the evidence relied on by the parties, we incline to the view that even if the existence of the bank along the railway, caused by the cutting made through the hill and any necessary cleaning out of the ditch, could be regarded as negligence in law, there was no foundation in fact for the finding that the bank maintained by the railway obstructed the view of a train coming from the south. The construction of the railway at this point no doubt required that the hill should be cut through. It is true that some witnesses asserted that the east bank of this cutting was increased in height by throwing on it materials taken from the ditch when from time to time it was cleaned out. But we are not in position to say that the defendant company in any way acted negligently with respect to the sides of the cutting, even granting that some material may have been thrown on either bank in the normal cleaning out of the ditches. Moreover the photographs filed at the trial graphically shew that what obstructed the view of the railway from the approach by Craig road, was not the east- ern bank of the cutting, but the hill itself which extends beyond the right of way of the defendant, and is higher on the adjacent property than it is on the railway right of way. We think that the wrongful finding of this ground of negligence against the defendant (in addition to the other fault found by the jury, sufficient to import liability, that the locomotive had not whistled at the whistling post), may have influenced the jury in their apportionment of the damages according to the degrees of fault as between T.L. Reynolds and the defendant. We have therefore come to the conclusion that a new trial of Reynolds\u2019 action must be directed, which shall proceed as if this action had been brought by his executors under the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1914, c. 151. The unsatisfactory character of the answer of the jury to question 4 renders it advisable that the new trial be not restricted to the apportionment of damages, but should take place generally on all issues. This does not mean that we think that Reynolds should be absolved from contributory negligence in approaching the crossing as he did. We express no opinion on that point which will be a matter for the jury\u2019s consideration.\nWe see nothing that could justify a finding of contributory negligence against Mary Craig, who has obtained leave to appeal, her recovery being under the appealable amount. Her appeal, therefore, will be allowed with costs here and in the appellate court, and the judgment of the trial court in her favour restored.\nReynolds\u2019 executors should have their costs in this court but should pay the defendant\u2019s costs in the Appellate Divisional Court, with set off. Costs of the abortive trial in Reynolds\u2019 case will abide the event of the new trial.\nAppeals allowed with costs. New trial ordered of Reynolds\u2019 action.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Cunningham & Smith.\nSolicitors for the respondent: MacMurchy & Spence.\n[1] (1926) 59 Ont.

D. made an assignment in bankruptcy. His landlord had previously issued a distress warrant for 11 months rent.\nHeld, D. was a \u201cretail merchant\u201d and also a \u201cperson who, as his ostensible occupation, bought and sold merchandise ordinarily the subject of trade and commerce,\u201d and was, therefore (under either of such descriptions), a \u201ctrader\u201d within s. 47 of the New Brunswick Act Respecting Landlord and Tenant, as enacted 1924, c. 30, and, therefore, under the application of s. 48 of said Act and of s. 52 of the Bankruptcy Act (D. 1919, c. 36) as enacted 1923, c. 31, his landlord\u2019s priority for rent over other debts was limited to three months rent accrued due prior to the date of the assignment.\nJudgment of the Supreme-Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, reversed, and judgment of Barry C.J. restored.\nA person may be held to be a \u201ctrader\u201d although he has, at the time he carries on his trading, another occupation which is his chief means of livelihood; and, it being shown that D. sold cigars, etc., to the public generally, the quantum of his trading therein was immaterial in determining whether or not he was a \u201ctrader.\u201d Cases reviewed.\nAn \u201costensible occupation\u201d is the employment of a person\u2019s time in a certain calling or pursuit so openly and conspicuously that the members of the public coming in contact with him would know that he was following that calling or pursuit. It does not import an exclusive, nor a chief, occupation, but it must be in the general way of business and not an intermittent or spasmodic employment. APPEAL, by special leave granted by the Chief Justice of this Court[1], from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, which, reversing the judgment of Barry C.J., held that the above named respondent, landlord of J. T. Dunlop, was entitled to be paid by the above-named appellant, authorized trustee in bankruptcy of the said Dunlop, all the money in his hands realized from the sale of Dunlop\u2019s property, towards satisfaction of eleven months rent due from Dunlop to the respondent. Barry C.J. had held that the respondent should be paid, in priority to all other debts, three months rent accrued due prior to the date of the assignment, and no more\u2014leaving it to the landlord to prove as a general creditor for the surplus rent, if any, due at the date of the assignment. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was allowed with costs, the judgment appealed from set aside, and the order of Barry C.J. restored.\nH. A. Porter for the appellant.\nE. P. Raymond K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014The facts of this case are not in dispute. Prior to May 11, 1926, J. T. Dunlop had been conducting and managing an hotel, known as the Dunlop Hotel, on premises owned by the respondent Guernsey. On April 26, 1926, the sheriff, acting under writs of execution in his hands, made a seizure of the goods and chattels of Dunlop in said hotel. On May 4, the landlord Guernsey issued a distress warrant for $3,025, being eleven months\u2019 rent at $275 per month, then due in respect of said premises, and sent it to one W. C. Wheaton with instructions to distrain on the goods and chattels of Dunlop in the hotel. On May 5 the sheriff, feeling that the property in the hotel seized by him was no longer safe without a man in possession, employed the said Wheaton and one Gibbons to remain in possession of the goods he had seized. Wheaton and Gibbons went into possession immediately. On May 11 J. T. Dunlop made an assignment under the Bankruptcy Act and the appellant Quinn was appointed trustee. On May 26 Quinn made an application to Chief Justice Barry, as Judge in Bankruptcy, for directions (a) as to how much of the bill presented by the sheriff should be paid as a preferred claim, and (b) as to what portion of the landlord\u2019s claim for rent should be treated as a preferred claim. The learned Chief Justice fixed the amount of the sheriff\u2019s bill at $252.21. As to the landlord\u2019s claim he held that Dunlop was a trader within the meaning of s. 47 of c. 30 of the Acts of New Brunswick of 1924, entitled An Act in addition to chapter 153 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, 1903, respecting Landlord and Tenant, and that the landlord was, therefore, only entitled to three months\u2019 rent in priority to the other debts, but leaving it to him to prove as a general creditor for the surplus rent due at the date of the assignment. From that part of the order of Barry, C.J., decreeing that the landlord was entitled to only three months\u2019 rent an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. That court set aside the order appealed against and held that the landlord was entitled to be paid by the trustee the full proceeds of the assets of J. T. Dunlop in the hands of the trustee, as those assets had not realized the amount of the eleven months\u2019 rent due when Dunlop made the assignment. The ground upon which the court reversed the order of Barry, C.J., was that, on the evidence, J. T. Dunlop could not be said to be a trader within the meaning of s. 47 above referred to. The trustee now appeals to this Court, and the question we have to determine is: Upon an assignment in bankruptcy by a debtor what priority, if any, has a landlord for rent in arrear of the premises on which were situated the debtor\u2019s goods and chattels at the date of the assignment?\nBy c. 31 of the Acts of 1923 (Can.), s. 52 of the Bankruptcy Act was repealed and the following enacted in lieu thereof:\u2014\n52. When a receiving order or an assignment is made against or by any lessee tinder this Act, the same consequences shall ensue as to the rights and priorities of his landlord as would have ensued under the laws of the province in which the demised premises are situated if the lessee at the time of such receiving order or assignment had been a person entitled to make and had made an abandonment or a voluntary assignment of his property for the benefit of his creditors pursuant to the laws of the province; and nothing in this Act shall be deemed to suspend, limit or affect the legislative authority of any province to enact any law providing for or regulating the rights and priorities of landlords consequent upon any such abandonment or voluntary assignment; nor shall anything in this Act be deemed to interfere or conflict with the operation of any such provincial law heretofore or hereafter enacted in so far as it provides for or regulates the rights and priorities of landlords in such an event.\nThe effect of this section is to give to a landlord in bankruptcy proceedings the same priority for rent in arrear as the law of the province would give him if his tenant had made an abandonment or a voluntary assignment of his property for the benefit of his creditors. What rights or priorities do the laws of New Brunswick give to a landlord where his tenant had made such a voluntary assignment?\nThe Act respecting Assignments and Preferences by Insolvent Persons (C.S. c. 141) contains no provision whatever giving a landlord priority for rent in case of an assignment under that Act. It is, however, provided for in the Act respecting Landlord and Tenant (C.S. c. 153). Section 21 of the Act provides that where a tenant\u2019s goods are seized under an execution against the tenant, the goods are not to be removed from the premises unless the execution creditor pays to the landlord the rent in arrear up to one year\u2019s rent. Sections 47, 48, 49 and 51 of the Act, which were enacted in 1924 (c. 30) presumably to meet the situation created by the enactment of the new section 52 of the Bankruptcy Act in 1923, read as follows:\u2014\n47. In this act, unless the context otherwise requires or implies, the word \u201ctrader\u201d means and includes retail merchants, wholesale merchants, commission merchants, manufacturers and persons who, as their ostensible occupation, buy and sell goods, wares and merchandise ordinarily the subject of trade and commerce.\n48. Where a tenant, having any goods or chattels on which his landlord has distrained or would be entitled to distrain for rent, has made an authorized assignment or has had a receiving order made against him under the Bankruptcy Act, being chapter 36 of the Dominion Statutes of the year 1919, and amendments thereto, the right of the landlord to distrain or realize his rent by distress shall cease from and after the date of the assignment or receiving order and the assignee or trustee under any such assignment or receiving order shall be entitled to immediate possession of the property of the tenant; but in the distribution of the property of the said tenant the assignee or trustee shall pay to the landlord, in priority of all other debts, an amount not exceeding the value of the distrainable assets, and not exceeding three months\u2019 rent accrued due prior to the date of the assignment or receiving order, and the costs of distress, if any.\n49. In the case of any such assignment or receiving order, the landlord may prove as a general creditor for\u2014\n(a) All surplus rent due at th\u00e9 date of the said assignment or receiving order; and\n(b) Any accelerated rent to which he may be entitled under his lease, not exceeding an amount equal to three months\u2019 rent.\n* * * 51. Sections 48, 49 and 50 of this Act shall apply only to \u201ctraders\u201d as defined by section 47 of this Act.\nIf, therefore, Dunlop was a trader s. 48 above quoted applies, and the respondent is entitled to priority for three months\u2019 rent only. To be a trader he must come within s. 47. The facts as found by Barry, C.J., and which are not disputed, are: That in addition to managing the hotel J. T. Dunlop in the outer lobby of the hotel conducted a cigar stand and sold cigars, cigarettes and tobacco not only to guests of his hotel but to the general public, and that at the rear of the premises there was a bar where he sold beer to the general public. Do these acts constitute him a trader within s. 47? On the facts proven he could not be said to be a wholesale merchant, commission merchant or manufacturer. Can he properly be termed either a retail merchant or a person who as his ostensible occupation buys and sells goods the subject of trade and commerce?\nIn Comyn\u2019s Digest, Vol. 5, at page 65 \u201cMerchant\u201d is defined as follows:\u2014\nAnd generally every one shall be a merchant who traffics by way of buying and selling or bartering of goods or merchandise within the Realm or in foreign parts.\nIn Murray\u2019s New English Dictionary a \u201cMerchant\u201d is defined as:\nOne whose occupation is the purchase and sale of marketable commodities for profit.\nA retail merchant is one who deals in merchandise by selling it in smaller quantities than he buys. U.S. v. Mickle[2]. If Dunlop, instead of conducting the cigar stand himself, had done as many hotel proprietors now do and had leased or sold to another the right to conduct the stand, and that other had sold cigars, cigarettes and tobacco to the general public for gain, there could not, in my opinion, be any question that such person would be a retail tobacco merchant within the meaning of s. 47. See Josselyn v. Parson[3]. If that is so would the person conducting the stand be any less a retail tobacco merchant because he managed the hotel as well?\nThat a person may be an hotel-keeper and also a trader is, I think, well established by the authorities. In the old case of Mayo v. Archer[4], a farmer bought a quantity of potatoes with the intention of selling them again for profit, which he did. Under the bankruptcy laws in force at the time a farmer could not be declared a bankrupt, but a trader could. It was held that the buying and selling of the potatoes for gain constituted the farmer a trader within the statute. In his judgment the Chief Justice said:\u2014\nI should think that if a Herdfordshire man bought apples to mix with his own and then sold the cider, he would be a trader.\nAnd Mr. Justice Powys said:\u2014\nIf a farmer should deal in wool or hops he will be a trader and so will an inn keeper who sells corn in quantities which are not consumed in his house.\nThe other two justices who comprised the court were of opinion that the quantities bought and sold should be shewn in order to see whether trading or farming was the debtor\u2019s chief business. It appears, however, now to be settled that the quantity sold is immaterial. In Patman v. Vaughan[5], the question was whether or not an inn keeper was a trader within the bankruptcy law. He was conducting an hotel and had on several occasions sold quantities of spirits to persons other than the hotel guests, and his servant testified that \u201cif any person had sent for liquor he might have had it.\u201d The learned trial judge left the question to the jury with the direction that \u201cif they were of opinion that the plaintiff had endeavoured to make a profit out of his trading and was ready to sell to anyone who applied to him and not merely as a favour, then the quantum and extent of the trading were immaterial.\u201d The jury found in favour of the defendant and the plaintiff moved for a new trial. In giving judgment Ashhurst J. said:\u2014\nI do not now consider the question of law to be governed by the quantum of the trading; but I take the rule to be this, that where it is a man\u2019s common or ordinary mode of dealing, or where if any stranger, who applies, may be supplied with the commodity in which the other professes to deal, and it is not sold as a favour to any particular person, there the person so selling is subject to the bankrupt laws.\nIn Bartholomew v. Sherwood[6], the question was whether a farmer who bought horses for the purpose of reselling them at a profit was a trader; it was held that he was. In that case Ashhurst J. said:\u2014\nThe general principle is right, that a farmer, as such, is not an object of the bankrupt laws; and if a farmer in the course of his business buys a horse and, after using him for some time, sells him again, that will not subject him to the bankrupt laws. But in this case the evidence is that he bought horses for the express purpose of gaining by it.\nAnd Buller J. said:\u2014\nIt is like the case of a vintner who if he sell only a few dozen of liquor to particular friends cannot be made a bankrupt. But if he be desirous to sell to every person who applies that will subject him to the bankruptcy laws.\nThese cases, in my opinion, are instructive in that they shew that a man may be held to be a trader although he has, at the time he carries on his trading, another occupation, which is his chief means of livelihood.\nIn giving the judgment of the Supreme Court of New-Brunswick, on appeal, in the present case, Mr. Justice Grimmer said:\u2014\nThere can I think be no doubt the question or more properly the occupation of buying and selling must be the determining factor. I cannot conceive that the ostensible occupation of a hotel keeper can be held to be in any sense the buying and selling of goods, wares and merchandise such as is ordinarily the subject of trade and commerce or barter.\nWith great deference, I am of opinion that this statement begs the question, for it assumes that it was in his capacity as hotel keeper that Dunlop bought and sold cigars and tobacco, while the evidence shews that he sold to the public generally and not merely to accommodate those who patronized his hotel. It could not have been in his capacity as hotel keeper that he sold to the general public. To my mind the question here is not what was Dunlop\u2019s ostensible occupation as hotel keeper, for undoubtedly as an hotel keeper his ostensible occupation was managing the hotel. The question is: Was he ostensibly occupied in selling cigars, cigarettes and tobacco? Was that his ostensible occupation?\nAn occupation signifies the employment of a person\u2019s time in some calling or pursuit, not simply periodically or for a special purpose, but more or less continuously and in a general way of business. In Creighton v. Chittick[7], Strong J. quoted with approval the following statement from Robson on Bankruptcy:\nSo also the buying and selling ought to be in the general way of business and not in a qualified manner or only for a special purpose.\n\u201cOstensibly\u201d is defined as \u201copen to view; open to public view; conspicuous.\u201d As ostensible occupation, therefore, is the employment of a person\u2019s time in a certain calling or pursuit so openly and conspicuously that the members of the public coming in contact with such person would know that he was following that calling or pursuit. It does not, to my mind, import an exclusive occupation, nor yet a chief occupation, but it must be in the general way of business and not an intermittent or spasmodic employment.\nWhile the selling of beer was chiefly done by Dunlop through a bar-tender, the evidence is that the cigar stand was conducted by himself; it was conducted openly and in the general way of business and anyone who desired to do so could buy. It, therefore, seems to me that anyone frequenting the lobby of that hotel and purchasing cigars, cigarettes or tobacco would know that Dunlop was employing his time, or part of his time at least, in selling those articles in the general way of business and to the public. That he was doing it for profit may, I think, be presumed until the contrary is shewn. It was argued that there was here no evidence that he purchased any cigars, cigarettes or tobacco. He must have either purchased or manufactured those he sold. If he manufactured them he comes expressly within s. 47, as a manufacturer.\nThere is nothing in the material to indicate whether the cigar stand, the bar, or the hotel did the largest business or furnished the greatest profit, even if these could be considered as essential elements in the determination of an ostensible occupation, which I doubt.\nSelling merchandise, as he did, openly to the public for the purpose of gain, brought Dunlop, in my opinion, within 1) a retail merchant, and (2) a person who as his ostensible occupation bought and sold merchandise the subject of trade and commerce. He was, therefore, a trader and s. 48 governs the respondent\u2019s priority. Having reached the conclusion that Dunlop was a trader it is not necessary to consider the priority, if any, to which a landlord is entitled where the debtor is a non-trader.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, should be allowed; the judgment appealed from set aside and the order of Barry C.J., restored. The appellant is entitled to his costs both here and on appeal below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Porter & Ritchie.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Edward P.

V, c. 44, ss. 6, 7 (1)\u2014Absence of affidavit in support of petition for re-issued patent.\nPlaintiff sued for infringement of a patent granted 25th November, 1924, as a re-issue, under s. 24 of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 69, of a patent applied for in 1919 and granted to plaintiff (as assignee of the inventor) on 20th January, 1920. Defendant challenged the validity of the patent, alleging material untruth in the affidavit prescribed by s. 10 of the Patent Act in verification of the petition for the original patent, in that the inventor swore that \u201cthe same has not been patented to me or others with my knowledge or consent in any country,\u201d which, it was alleged, was untrue in view of the issue of a German patent in 1917 for the same invention; and claiming that because of such untruth of a material allegation (Patent Act, s. 29) the original patent was invalid, which rendered the re-isued patent likewise invalid. Defendant also alleged, as a ground of invalidity, the absence of any affidavit in support of the petition for the re-issued patent.\nHeld, that, in view of ss. 6 and 7 (1) of 11-12 Geo. V, c. 44 (amending the Patent Act), which were applicable to the case, and their effect with regard to the materiality of the impugned statement, and in the absence of fraudulent intent, the attack on the validity of the original patent (and, on this foundation, of the re-issued patent) must fail; that, as to absence of an affidavit in support of the petition for the re-issued patent, any insufficiency in the material on which the Commissioner acts, the entire absence of an affidavit or any defect in the form and substance of that which is put forward as an affidavit in support of the claim, cannot, in the absence of fraud, avail an alleged infringer as a ground of attack on a new patent issued under s. 24; it is not a \u201cfact or default which, by this Act or by law, renders the patent void\u201d (s. 34); the recital of the patent that the applicant had complied with the requirements of the Patent Act, was conclusive against defendant in the absence of fraud; (Whittemore v. Cutter, 1 Gallison, 429, at p. 433; Seymour v. Osborne, 11Wallace, 516, at p. 541; Wayne Mfg. Co. v. Coffield Motor Washer Co., 227 Fed. Rep. 987 at pp. 990-1; Hunter v. Carrick, 10 Ont. A.R. 449, at p. 468, cited).\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court ([1927] Ex. C.R. 107) affirmed, subject to modification of the formal judgment to restrict it to the claims in issue. APPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], in an action for infringement of patent. The only issue on the appeal was as to the validity of the patent in question. The grounds on which its validity was attacked, and the material facts of the case, are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported.\nE. Lafleur K.C. and W. D. Herridge for the appellant.\nO. M. Biggar K.C., R. S. Smart K.C. and J. C. MacFarlane for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The defendant appeals from the judgment of the Exchequer Court (Maclean, P.)1 holding it liable to the plaintiffs for infringement of Canadian patent no. 244,847, granted on the 25th November, 1924, as a re-issue of Canadian patent no. 196,390, granted on the 20th January, 1920.\nThe fact of infringement, if the patent in question be valid, is no longer in controversy. The only issue on the present appeal is as to the validity of the patent, which is challenged on these grounds:\u2014\n(a) Material untruth in the affidavit prescribed by s. 10 of the Patent Act (R.S.C., c. 69) in verification of the petition for the original patent no. 196,390, in that a prior patent had, to the knowledge of the affiant, been granted in Germany for the same invention;\n(b) (1) Invalidity of the original patent because of such untruth of a material allegation (s. 29) rendering the re-issued patent likewise invalid;\n(b) (2) Absence of any affidavit in support of the petition for the re-issued patent.\nThe defendant also complains that the declaration and injunction granted by the Exchequer Court are wider than the issues presented to it justified.\nBy s. 29 of the Patent Act a patent is void.\nif any material allegation in the petition or declaration [prescribed by s. 101 is untrue. We assume that by the \u201cdeclaration of the applicant\u201d mentioned in s. 29 is meant the affidavit of the \u201cinventor\u201d required by s. 10. We also assume that the German patent of 1917 in fact covered the invention patented by Canadian patent no. 196,390. The statement in the inventor\u2019s affidavit verifying the petition on which that patent was granted, which is impugned, is\nthat the same [i.e. the invention for which the patent was sought] has not been patented to me or others with my knowledge or consent in any country.\nThat the issue of the German patent was actually known to the affiant is not, perhaps, as conclusively established as it might have been. We are not disposed to infer fraudulent intent negatived by the trial judge. The materiality of the statement, however, having regard to s. 8 of the Patent Act, would admit of little doubt, were it not for the enactment of ss. 6 and 7 (1) of the amending statute, 11 & 12 Geo. V, c. 44, which came into force on the 4th of June, 1921.\nThose sections read as follows:\u2014\n(6) The rights provided by section eight of the Patent Act for the filing of applications for patents for invention which rights had not expired on the first day of August, 1914, or which rights have arisen since that date shall be, and the same are hereby extended, until the expiration of a period of six months from the coming into force of this Act, and such extension shall apply to applications upon which patents have been granted as well as to applications now pending or filed within said period. Provided that such extension shall in no way affect the right of any person, who, before the passage of this Act, was bona fide in possession of any rights in patents or applications for patent conflicting with rights in patents granted or validated by reason of such extension, to exercise such rights himself personally or by such agents, or licensees, as derived their rights from him, before the passage of this Act, and such persons shall not be amenable to any action for infringement of any patent granted or validated by reason of such extension.\n(7) (1) A patent shall not be refused on an application filed between the first day of August, 1914, and the expiration of a period of six months from the coming into force of this Act, nor shall a patent granted on such application be held invalid by reason of the invention having been patented in any other country or in any other of His Majesty\u2019s Dominions or Possessions or described in any printed publication or because it was in public use or on sale prior to the filing of the application, unless such patent or publication or such public use or sale was issued or made prior to the first day of August, 1913.\nIt will be noticed that these provisions apply to applications on which patents had already been granted, as well as to applications still pending when the statute came into force\u2014under s. 6 where the rights provided by s. 8 had not expired on, or had arisen after, the 1st of August, 1914, and under s. 7 (1) where the application for the patent in question was made after the 1st of August, 1914.\nThe rights of the plaintiffs\u2019 assignor (Langmuir) under s. 8, arose after the 1st of August, 1914, and his application for patent no, 196,390, was also made after that date. The present case, therefore, falls within the provisions of those sections and, having regard to them, the untruth of his statement, assuming that the existence of the German patent rendered it untrue, can scarcely now be regarded as material, since under s. 7 (1) of the amending Act the existence of the German patent of 1917 cannot be made a ground for avoiding Canadian patent no, 196,390, applied for in 1919, and issued in January, 1920. At all events, in the absence of proof of fraudulent intent on the part of Langmuir, we are not prepared to hold that his patent no. 196,390 was void.\nWe accordingly consider that the attack on the validity of the original patent must fail, if it would have been otherwise open to impeachment under s. 29 by an alleged infringer.\nThe foundation of the attack upon the re-issued patent on ground (b) (1) thus also disappears.\nNor can the appellant fare better in regard to ground (b) (2). Patent no. 244,847 was a re-issue under s. 24 of the Patent Act (now s. 27 of 13-14 Geo. V, c 23). While no affidavit is prescribed by that section to obtain such a re-issue, it is contended for the appellant that s. 10 applies to a re-issue under s. 24 as well as to the issue of an original patent under s. 7. The respondent, on the other hand, maintains that the Commissioner is authorized to satisfy himself by such means as he deems proper and sufficient, as to the existence of the conditions entitling the applicant to a new patent. However that may be, we are satisfied that any insufficiency in the material on which the Commissioner acts, the entire absence of an affidavit or any defect in the form and substance of that which is put forward as an affidavit in support of the claim, cannot, in the absence of fraud, which in this instance has not been suggested, avail an alleged infringer as a ground of attack on a new patent issued under s. 24. It is not a \u201cfact or default, which, by this Act, or by law, renders the patent void\u201d (Patent Act, s. 34). The recital of the patent that the applicant as assignee of the Langmuir patent no. 196,390, \u201chas complied with the requirements of the Patent Act\u201d is conclusive against the appellant in the absence of fraud. Whittemore v. Cutter[2]; Seymour v. Osborne[3]; Wayne Manufacturing Co. v. Coffield Motor Washer Co.[4]; Hunter v. Carrick[5].\nThe appeal, therefore, so far as it depends on the invalidity of patent no. 244,847, fails.\nBut, having regard to the fact that the allegations of infringement were ultimately confined to claims nos. 3, 6 and 10 of patent no. 244,847, it may be better that the judgment of the Exchequer Court be modified so as to make clearer what we think was by it intended. To that end we would expressly restrict the finding of infringement with which paragraph no. 1 of that judgment concludes, so that it would read as follows:\u2014\nand has been infringed as to the claims thereof numbered 3, 6 and 10 by the defendant as alleged in the pleadings;\nand the injunction should also be modified accordingly.\nSubject to this slight variation, the appeal will be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nInjunction modified.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Henderson & Herridge.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Russell S.

No other ground for annulment than the breach in respect of which damages are claimed is alleged. If the alleged breach is established and the plaintiffs are thereby entitled to recover, damages, a necessary consequence is that the contract is no longer binding upon them and a formal declaration of its nullity might follow as a matter of course. There being on this hypothesis no obligation on the plaintiffs from which such declaration of nullity would relieve them, it is impossible to attach to it any money value. On the other hand, if breach of contract by the defendant has not been established, no case is made for annulment, and to grant annulment and thus deprive the defendants of any right of action they may have for failure of the plaintiffs to accept and pay for the pasteurization machines which the defendants supplied under the contract would be unwarranted.\nIn any aspect of the case the only substantial matter in controversy on the present appeal is the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover damages for breach of contract amounting at the most to the $1,875 claimed.\nThe motion to quash should therefore be granted with costs.\nMotion granted with costs.\n",

The appellant then took a second action under that Act; and in the statement of claim signed by his attorney, he specially alleged that there was res judicata as to his right to claim under that Act.

A. De Billy K.C. for the appellant.\nW. Lazure for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un jugement de la cour du Banc du Roi renvoyant pour cause d\u2019acquiescement un appel que rappelant avait pris d\u2019un jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure si\u00e9geant dans le district de Saint-Fran\u00e7ois, Qu\u00e9bec[2].\nVictime d\u2019un accident alors qu\u2019il travaillait pour le compte de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019appelant s\u2019est pourvu contre cette derni\u00e8re en r\u00e9clamation de $6,357.18 de dommages sous l\u2019empire du droit commun, all\u00e9guant que ses blessures avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9es par la faute de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Celle-ci, entre autres moyens, plaida en d\u00e9fense que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait de recours contre elle qu\u2019en vertu de la Loi des accidents du travail, et pour ce seul motif la cour sup\u00e9rieure renvoya l\u2019action.\nAvant l\u2019expiration des d\u00e9lais pour appeler de ce jugement, l\u2019appelant intenta une nouvelle action contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e, cette fois sous la Loi des accidents du travail, par laquelle il r\u00e9clamait $9,581.25 d\u2019indemnit\u00e9, pr\u00e9tendant qu\u2019il y avait eu faute inexcusable de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Dans sa d\u00e9claration, sign\u00e9e par son procureur ad litem, rappelant all\u00e9gua ce qui suit, apr\u00e8s avoir relat\u00e9 l\u2019accident et les autres faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce:\u2014\n33. Le demandeur avait intent\u00e9 une action, pour le dit accident, en vertu du droit commun;\n34. La d\u00e9fenderesse, par ses procureurs, a plaid\u00e9 que l\u2019accident tombait sous le recours de la Loi des accidents du travail de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\n35. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par l\u2019honorable juge Archambault, a rendu jugement sur le litige le 14 octobre courant et a jug\u00e9 que le dit accident tombait sous la Loi des accidents du travail;\n36. Il y a donc chose jug\u00e9e sur ce point, \u00e0 savoir que le recours pour le dit accident n\u2019en est pas un de droit commun, mais tombe sous la Loi des accidents du travail de la province de Qu\u00e9bec:\n(Le demandeur produit comme pi\u00e8ce n\u00b0 1 copie du jugement de l\u2019honorable juge Archambault, dat\u00e9 du 14 octobre courant, pour valoir, comme s\u2019il \u00e9tait ici r\u00e9cit\u00e9 au long.)\nPlus tard, en temps utile, l\u2019appelant interjeta appel du jugement rendu contre lui dans la premi\u00e8re cause. L\u2019intim\u00e9e demanda alors par motion le rejet de l\u2019appel, pr\u00e9tendant que, par les paragraphes rapport\u00e9s plus haut, rappelant avait acquiesc\u00e9 au jugement. Cette motion fut accueillie par la Cour du Banc du Roi qui d\u00e9bouta l\u2019appelant de son appel. Il s\u2019agit maintenant de savoir si r\u00e9ellement il y a eu acquiescement valable.\nIl est indubitable que l\u2019acquiescement \u00e0 un jugement adverse, \u00e9tant la renonciation \u00e0 tout recours contre ce jugement, ne se pr\u00e9sume pas et doit \u00eatre non \u00e9quivoque. Avant tout, c\u2019est une affaire de volont\u00e9 et d\u2019intention, et si cette volont\u00e9 et cette intention n\u2019apparaissent pas, il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019acquiescement (Movin v. Walter)[3].\nIl faut observer, en outre, que l\u2019acquiescement doit \u00eatre l\u2019\u0153uvre de la partie elle-m\u00eame ou de son procureur \u00e0 ce d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9; le simple mandat ad litem ne suffit pas (Garsonnet, Proc\u00e9dure Civile, l\u00e8re \u00e9dition, tome 5, n\u00b0 1218, \u00e0 la page 914), surtout quand il s\u2019agit, comme dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, d\u2019acquiescer \u00e0 un jugement rendu dans une instance autre que celle o\u00f9 le procureur ad litem occupe. On peut citer dans ce sens l\u2019opinion du juge Sir Elz\u00e9ar Taschereau dans la cause de La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Canadienne Fran\u00e7aise de Construction de Montr\u00e9al v. Daveluy[4]. Du reste, tout ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 depuis la production de la d\u00e9claration atteste que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a jamais entendu acquiescer. Il a tent\u00e9 de retirer ses paragraphes malencontreux par voie d\u2019amendement avant que la d\u00e9fenderesse e\u00fbt produit de d\u00e9fense. Il est vrai que son amendment a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 pour des motifs que nous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier, mais le fait m\u00eame de cet amendement, avant que i\u2019intim\u00e9e e\u00fbt demand\u00e9 acte de la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019appelant, d\u00e9montre que l\u2019intention d\u2019acquiescer n\u2019existait pas. Dans les affidavits que l\u2019appelant et son procureur ont produits devant la Cour du Banc du Roi, il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a jamais autoris\u00e9 son procureur ad litem \u00e0 acquiescer, et avant l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai l\u2019appelant a de fait appel\u00e9 du jugement. Il nous est impossible dans ces circonstances de dire qu\u2019il y a eu volont\u00e9 ferme de renoncer au droit d\u2019appel.\nAvec beaucoup de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, nous croyons que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens et la motion de l\u2019intim\u00e9e renvoy\u00e9e aussi avec d\u00e9pens. La cause retournera devant la Cour du Banc du Roi pour y \u00eatre proc\u00e9d\u00e9 sur l\u2019appel de l\u2019appelant.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bernier & de Billy.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Nicol, Lazure & Couture.\n[1] (1927) q.r. 42 K.B. 499.\n[2] (1927) q.r. 65 s.c. 63.\n[3] [19281 S.C.R. 678.\n[4] (1891) 20 Can.

C.\nThe appellant was convicted on an indictment charging him with having, with intent to defraud and by false pretences, obtained from one Mrs. Falardeau and one Mrs. Cirkel valuable securities of about $404,000, by inducing them to transfer property to appellant\u2019s wife in consideration of an annuity of $400 monthly during their lives. At the trial, the appellant sought to prove certain conversations between Mrs. Cirkel and Mr. R. G. de Lorimier K.C., his intention being to show that the deeds of transfer were passed at the request and in compliance with the importunities of Mrs. Cirkel with whom the suggestion of an annuity, he claimed, had originated. The trial judge, having convinced himself by questions put by him to Mr. deLorimier that the latter had acted as legal adviser of these ladies, refused to allow the evidence on the ground that these communications between client and solicitor were privileged and could not be disclosed without the consent of Mrs. Cirkel, which consent she refused to give. The appellant\u2019s conviction was affirmed by the appellate court; and the appellant now moves for leave of appeal to this court under article 1024a of the Criminal Code, on the ground that the judgment to be appealed from conflicts with the judgment of the Alberta appellate court in Rex v. Prentice and Wright. ( (1914) 7 Alia. L.R. 479.)\nHeld that there is no possible conflict between this decision and the one from which the appellant seeks leave to appeal to this court. The Alberta court fully recognized the rule that relevant communications between solicitor and client are privileged unless the client consents to their disclosure; all that was decided in that case was that the client had agreed to this disclosure when he instructed his solicitor to communicate to the opposite party or his solicitor something prima facie privileged and that, under these circumstances, the communication which the solicitor was instructed to make to the solicitor of the adverse party was not privileged.\nMOTION for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the conviction of the appellant on an indictment charging him with having obtained certain property by false pretences.\nThe material facte of the case are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nN. K. Laflamme K.C. and Lucien Gendron for the appellant.\nA. R. Macmaster K.C. for the respondent.\nMignault J.\u2014The appellant, on September 15th, 1926, was convicted before Victor Cusson, a magistrate sitting as a judge of the Court of Special Sessions at Montreal, on an indictment charging him with having, with intent to defraud and by false pretences, obtained from Dame Ang\u00e9lique Leduc, widow of C. B. Falardeau, and Dame M. L. Falardeau, widow of Fritz Cirkel, various stocks and bonds and titles to immovable properties, shares, hypothecs, moneys, and other valuable securities, the whole of a total value of about $404,000. The complaint against the appellant in short was that by making false representations to these ladies he had induced them to transfer property to his wife in consideration of an annuity of $400 monthly during their lives. These representations were that the deceased, C. B. Falardeau (who had appointed his wife his universal legatee, the latter being also owner of one-half of the estate as having been in community of property with her husband) had neglected to make proper returns of income under the War Income Tax Act, especially in connection with a company known as the Canada Industrial Company of which he had virtually the ownership and control; that the deceased and his estate had thereby incurred large penalties; and that the appellant was in position to settle this liability. The transfers were made by four deeds passed before Mr. Lavimodi\u00e8re, notary, on December 24th, 1924.\nAt the trial, the appellant sought to prove certain conversations between Mrs. Cirkel, a daughter of the deceased, and Mr. R. G. deLorimier K.C., his intention being to show that these deeds were passed at the request and in compliance with the importunities of Mrs. Cirkel with whom the suggestion of an annuity, he claimed, had originated. The learned trial judge having convinced himself by questions put by him to Mr. deLorimier that the latter had acted as legal adviser of these two ladies, refused to allow the evidence on the ground that these communications between client and solicitor were privileged and could not be disclosed without the consent of Mrs. Cirkel, which consent she refused to give. The appellant was convicted and sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment in the penitentiary.\nThe appellant appealed from the conviction to the Court of King\u2019s Bench on several questions of law, the only one with which I am concerned being the exclusion of the evidence to which I have referred. The Court of King\u2019s Bench (Guerin, Bernier and Hall, JJ.), on April 25th, 1927, unanimously dismissed his appeal. The judgment of the court was delivered by Mr. Justice Hall. On the question of the legality of the evidence sought to be obtained from Mr. deLorimier, the judgment is as follows:\nThe last ground of the appeal is that based on the objection to the evidence of Mr. deLorimier. If he were not the solicitor of the Falardeau, it can hardly be doubted that the accused was entitled to offer evidence of the conversations he had with Mrs. Cirkel. But it as impossible for me to interpret his relations with Mrs. Cirkel in any other light than that of solicitor and client. He himself says, that he was not consulted \u201cen ma qunlit\u00e9 d\u2019avocat,\u201d but he admits that he made entries in his books against the estate.\nMr. deLorimier, like Howley, was an old friend of the family, and had been solicitor for the Canada Industrial Company for some years. When Falardeau died, he attended on Mrs. Falardeau and, at Mrs. Cirkel\u2019s request, consented to look after her interests.\nHowley himself reports that Mrs. Cirkel had seen deLorimier and arranged for him to look after her affairs, and again, \u201cdeLorimier was representing the Falardeau interests.\u201d\nThen Ouimet, the man Howley appointed secretary of the company, says that Mrs. Cirkel declared: \u201cdeLorimier est notre aviseur legal.\u201d Janssen reports that, on Mrs. Cirke\u2019ls representation, he went to deLorimier to get advice.\nI conclude, therefore, that Mr. deLorimier was acting for Mrs. Cirkel in his quality of advocate, and that his evidence was properly excluded.\nThe appellant now comes before me asking for leave to appeal from the unanimous judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench. His petition is founded on article 1024A of the Criminal Code and can only be granted if the judgment appealed from conflicts with the judgment of some other court of appeal in a like case. Subject to a judicial exercise of any discretion conferred by that article, I am in no way concerned with the merits of the appeal, or with the legality or illegality of the evidence tendered, but only with the question whether such conflict exists.\nThe decision on which the appellant relies as being in conflict with the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench is a decision of the appellate division of the Supreme Court of Alberta in Rex v. Prentice and Wright[1], decided on October 23rd, 1914.\nThe judgment of the Alberta court was rendered on a case stated by the trial judge, referring to three points, the only one which need be considered here being the following:\n1. In the course of the cross-examination of George Brown (the complainant), counsel for Prentice directed certain questions to him on the subject of when he first considered commencing criminal proceedings, and inquired whether it was not at about the time certain civil proceedings were commenced by Prentice against Brown, in which Prentice made large claims in respect of certain building contracts. Counsel for Prentice then asked the witness: \u201cYou remember instructing your solicitors to communicate with Prentice\u2019s solicitors at that time?\u201d I instructed the witness not to answer, and the following discussion then took place:\u2014\n\u201cMr. Biggar: If the solicitor can communicate to other people and the person who moves him cannot be asked if it was on his authority, it puts the solicitor in a very happy position. I am asking if he authorized his solicitor to do something, some particular thing.\n\u201cThe Court: If you show first that he later did a certain thing.\n\u201cMr. Biggar: I cannot interpose a witness.\n\u201cThe Court: All right, you cannot ask the question.\n\u201cMr. Biggar: Does your Lordship think I am at liberty to interpose a witness?\n\u201cThe Court: No, I do not think so.\n\u201cMr. Biggar: Your Lordship suggested that if I prove if the solicitor had done something, I can ask the witness if he authorized it. Now, I am simply suggesting, even if there is a way to interpose, that your Lordship\u2019s suggestion should be given effect to in anticipation of the question.\n\u201cThe Court: No, I am merely holding that you cannot ask the question that you are now putting.\n\u201cMr. Biggar: Well, perhaps I am putting it in that form. What I want to inquire is whether he authorized his solicitor to take certain steps with regard to the institution of inquiries for the purpose of instituting criminal proceedings against the present defendant. Your Lordship rules against me. Very good. My friend, Mr. Ford, asks that your Lordship would at this stage rule against him on exactly the same point.\n\u201cThe Court: Yes.\n\u201cWas I right in excluding the evidence?\nThe Alberta court decided that the trial judge should have allowed the question to be put to Brown. Mr. Justice Beck, with whom Mr. Justice Stuart concurred on this point, said:\nThe first question raises this point: Can a witness, on the ground of privilege, be allowed to refuse to answer the question whether he authorized or directed his solicitor to make a certain communication to the solicitor for the opposite party in anticipated or pending litigation? The learned judge\u2019s ruling is distinctly placed on the ground of privilege in the witness, not on the ground that the question was irrelevant or vexatious (Rule 199). The whole question of privileged communications between client and solicitor is discussed at great length in Wig-more on Evidence, ch. LXXX. The rule is there formulated, par. 2292, with, I think, sufficient accuracy:\u2014\n\u201cWhere legal advice of any kind is sought from a professional legal adviser in his capacity as such, the communications relevant to that purpose, made in confidence by the client, are at his instance permanently protected from disclosure by himself or by the legal adviser, except the client waives protection.\u201d\nIt surely is beyond question that the contents of the communication itself from the witness\u2019s solicitor to the solicitor for the opposite party which, in order to avoid confusion I shall call the letter, do not come under the privilege, for the contents of the letter were ex hypothesi intended to be made known to a third party in adverse interest, and therefore neither the contents nor the actual letter itself can possibly be said to have been communicated by the client to the solicitor in confidence. It seems almost, if not equally, plain that the authorization or direction to send the letter does not come under the privilege, for the mere authorization or direction is not a statement made for the purpose of obtaining advice. The question of fact whether or not the authorization or direction was given \u201cis not within the mischief which that rule is intended to guard against; and, therefore, is not within the rule\u201d: Desborough v. Rawlins[2]. I, therefore, think the ruling of the learned trial judge in respect of the first question reserved was wrong.\nThe third judge, Mr. Justice Simmons, concurred. He quoted the following statement of the law by Jessel, M.R., in Anderson v. Bank of British Columbia[3]:\nThat, as by reason of the complexity and difficulty of our law, litigation can only be properly conducted by professional men, it is absolutely necessary that a man, in order to prosecute his rights, or to defend himself from an improper claim, should have recourse to the assistance of professional lawyers, and, it being so absolutely necessary, it is equally necessary, to use a vulgar phrase, that he should be able to make a clean breast of it to the gentleman whom he consults with a view to the prosecution of his claim, or the substantiating his defence against the claim of others; that he should be able to place unrestricted and unbounded confidence in the professional agent, and that the communication he so makes to him should be kept secret unless with his consent (for it is his privilege and not the privilege of his confidential agent), that he should be enabled properly to conduct his litigation.\nAnd Mr. Justice Simmons added:\nThe client can remove the privilege by consent, and in the case under consideration the question is based upon the assumption that the witness did consent to removal of the privilege by instructing his solicitor to communicate something prim\u00e2 facie privileged.\nI conclude, therefore, that the ruling of the learned trial judge was incorrect.\nI take it therefore that the Alberta court fully recognized the rule as stated by Wigmore and Sir George Jessel that relevant communications between solicitor and client are privileged unless the client consents to their disclosure. All that was decided in that case was that the client had agreed to this disclosure when he instructed his solicitor to communicate to the opposite party or his solicitor \u201csomething prim\u00e2 facie privileged,\u201d and that under these circumstances the communication which the solicitor was instructed to make to the solicitor of the adverse party was not privileged. There is therefore no possible conflict between this decision and the one from which the appellant seeks leave to appeal.\nThe application is dismissed.\nMotion dismissed.\n[1] (1914) 7 Alta.

V, c. 46, now R.S.Q. [1925], c. 98, sections 2520 oc, 2520 od, 2520 oj.\nThe respondent is the secretary of a branch of the Federation of Municipal Employees, formed by the police employees of the city of Montreal. The municipal council passed a resolution that no member of the police force would be allowed to be a member of the police union and authorized the chief of police to act accordingly. The latter issued an order that it was \u201cstrictly forbidden for all officers or men to belong to the police union as constituted and they have eight days from to-day to dispose of all money,\u201d etc. The respondent asked by his action that the resolution and the order be annulled and set aside as being in contravention with the provisions of the \u201cMunicipal Strike and Lock-out Act.\u201d\nHeld that, even if the resolution and the order constituted a threat of dismissal in case of non-compliance with them, the city of Montreal did not contravene the Act, as the legislative intention was to limit its application to cases in which there had been an actual dismissal of an employee before submitting the dispute to a board of arbitration.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 42 K.B. 335) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1] affirming the judgment of the Superior Court at Montreal, Coderre J., and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action.

Lafleur K.C. and J. Sullivan K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014This is an appeal by the city of Montreal against the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side) confirming a judgment of the Superior Court which declared illegal and void certain resolutions passed by the city and a certain order of the chief of police based thereon.\nFor some time prior to July, 1922, friction had existed between the city council and the Federation of Municipal Employees. This federation was a labour union including among its members the police employees of various cities and municipalities in the Dominion. In 1918 a branch of the union, known as branch no. 62, was formed by the police employees of Montreal. The plaintiff was the secretary of this branch. The union desired the city to recognize its existence and to deal with it through its duly appointed representatives in case of any dispute between the city and any of the members of the union employees of the city. This the city would not do. On July 13th, 1922, the union passed a resolution in which their grievances, so far as they related to the police force, were set out in the following words:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant: que les employ\u00e9s de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al se plaignent de souffrir depuis longtemps de nombreux griefs dont les principaux sont:\nChez les policiers: refus de la part du comit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutif du conseil que l\u2019arbitrage qu\u2019ils ont demand\u00e9 et qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 par le ministre des Travaux publics et du Travail suive son cours;\nA copy of this resolution was forwarded to the city council and was by it referred to a special committee which reported as follows:\u2014\n1. Votre commission se d\u00e9clare oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019union de la police telle qu\u2019elle existe actuellement.\n2. Votre commission est d\u2019opinion qu\u2019aucune f\u00e9d\u00e9ration des employ\u00e9s municipaux ne doit exister en ce qui concerne les membres du corps de police, des pompiers et les employ\u00e9s du d\u00e9partment de l\u2019aqueduc; la commission n\u2019a cependant aucune objection \u00e0 l\u2019existence de l\u2019Association de Bienfaisance de la Police, de celle des pompiers, et d\u2019une autre semblable dans le d\u00e9partement de l\u2019aqueduc.\nThis report was unanimously adopted by the council on September 15th, 1922. On November 28th, 1923, the council passed the following resolution:\u2014\nR\u00e9solu\nVu que l\u2019union des policiers n\u2019est pas reconnue par la cit\u00e9;\nQu\u2019aucun membre de la force constabulaire ne peut faire partie de telle soci\u00e9t\u00e9; et que le chef de police soit autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre les mesures disciplinaires n\u00e9cessaires pour que l\u2019on se conforme aux r\u00e9solutions adopt\u00e9es par le conseil et le comit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutif.\nInstructions were given to the chief of police in accordance with this resolution. On November 29th the chief of police issued the following order:\u2014\nThat it is strictly forbidden for all officers or men to belong to the police union as constituted and they have 8 days from to-day to dispose of all money, etc.\nOrder of the executive board.\nPer Chief B\u00e9langer.\nConsidering that the resolutions and order above referred to contravened the provisions of the Municipal Strike and Lock-out Act, c. 46, 11 Geo. V (now [1925] R.S.Q., c. 98), the plaintiff, on March 31st, 1924, brought this action, and asked that the resolutions of September 15th, 1922, and November 28th, 1923, and the order of the chief of police of November 29th, 1923, be annulled and set aside on the ground that they were ultra vires of the city council and contrary to law. He further asked that an injunction issue restricting the city from enforcing the said order. The learned trial judge upheld the plaintiff\u2019s claim and declared illegal and void the said resolutions and order; and he granted the injunction restraining the city from proceeding to enforce them. On appeal the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Dorion and Tellier JJ. dissenting) affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court. The city now appeals to this court.\nThe pertinent provisions of s. 2520 o, are as follows:\u2014\n2520 oc. This section shall apply to any claim or dispute between employers and employees in connection with the following matters:\na. The price to be paid for work done or in course of being done, whether the disagreement has arisen with respect to wages, working hours, by night or by day, or the length of day or night work;\nb. The dismissal of one or more employees on account of membership in any labour union. 2520 od. It shall be unlawful for an employer to declare or cause a lock-out, or for employees to strike, on account of any dispute mentioned in the foregoing article before such dispute has been submitted to a board of arbitration.\n2520 oj. Any employer who declares or who is the cause of a lockout in contravention of the provisions of this section, shall be liable to a fine of not less than one hundred nor more than one thousand dollars, for every day or part of a day that such lock-out lasts.\nIt is admitted that there is no claim or dispute under sub. s. (a) of 2520 oc The action, therefore, if it can be maintained, must come within sub. s. (b).\nFor the city it is contended that the action is premature in that there can be no claim or dispute in connection with the dismissal of an employee on account of membership in a labour union until an employee has been actually dismissed because of such membership. While for the respondents it is contended that the resolutions of November 28th, 1923, passed by the city, and the order of the chief of police based thereon, constituted a clear threat of dismissal in case of non-compliance with the order; that such threat, even without a dismissal, created between the city and its police employees, who desired to maintain their membership in the union, a dispute which could properly be said to be\na dispute in connection with the dismissal of one or more employees;\nthat the dismissal of those employees would amount to a lock-out within the meaning of 2520 od, and that as the declaring or causing of a lock-out would be unlawful before such dispute had been submitted to arbitration, the legislature must have intended that resort should be had to arbitration in order to forestall and prevent the threatened lock-out. This contention was given effect to in the courts below.\nWith great deference I am of opinion that the judgments below cannot be upheld. It is quite clear that there was a difference of opinion between the city council and the union as to the desirability of having the city recognize the union. Such a difference of opinion, however, the legislature has not seen fit to bring within the purview of the Act. As an employer who declares or is the cause of a lockout in contravention of the section is liable to a penalty for so doing, the section must be strictly construed and must be limited in its application to such matters as clearly come within the language used. The section, in so far as this action is concerned, is limited to a\nclaim or dispute in connection with the dismissal of one or more employees.\nNow it will be observed that there is no intimation in the language of the resolutions or order that a failure to comply with the order will be followed by dismissal. There is, therefore, no express threat of dismissal. It is, however, contended that as the exercise of the power of dismissal is the only means which the city has of compelling obedience to the order, the language of the order implies that non-compliance therewith will be followed by dismissal, and that it was so understood by the employees. Even if that be so it is not, in my opinion, sufficient to constitute\na claim or dispute in connection with the dismissal of one or more employees.\nUntil an employee has been dismissed I am unable to see how any claim or dispute can arise in connection with his dismissal. Upon this point I find myself in harmony with the reasons given by Mr. Justice Dorion and Mr. Justice Tellier.\nIn his judgment Mr. Justice Dorion says:\u2014\nJe crois que d\u00e9clarer la gr\u00e8ve, ou la contre-gr\u00e8ve, c\u2019est la faire. La contre-gr\u00e8ve c\u2019est le renvoi des employ\u00e9s. Or la cit\u00e9 n\u2019a d\u00e9mis aucun policier. Et si les policiers persistent dans leur refus de quitter l\u2019union, la cit\u00e9 peut encore se conformer \u00e0 la loi (c\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le temps o\u00f9 cela doit se faire) et demander la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un conseil d\u2019arbitrage suivant l\u2019article 2520 c.f.\nAnd Mr. Justice Tellier says:\u2014\nIl n\u2019y a qu\u2019au cas o\u00f9 le conseil s\u2019aviserait de s\u00e9vir contre les r\u00e9fractaires et de recourir \u00e0 la contre-gr\u00e8ve ou au renvoi des policiers qu\u2019il violerait la loi. Jusque l\u00e0, il est dans son droit, et la loi des gr\u00e8ves et contre-gr\u00e8ves municipales est sans application, parce que le cas qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9voit ne se pr\u00e9sente pas.\nThe resolutions and order under attack in this action were declarations of policy on, the part of the city council. They constituted an expression of the council\u2019s intention. The council, however, was always in a position to review its expressed intention and to alter its policy at any time before carrying it into effect. And that is evidently what took place here. The eight days specified in the order of the chief of police expired, but their expiration was not followed by any dismissal. The council stayed its hand as it had a perfect right to do and its implied threat of dismissal never amounted to more than a threat. Wherein then did the city contravene the Act? If the legislature had intended the Act to apply to a claim or dispute in connection with a threat of dismissal as well as to a claim or dispute in connection with the dismissal itself, it could and doubtless would have said so. Not having said so I am of opinion that the legislative intention was to limit the application of the Act under sub. s. (b) to cases in which there had been an actual dismissal.\nThat such was the legislative intention is, I think, supported by the language used in s. 2520 oj, above quoted.\nIf the city had been prosecuted for declaring or causing a lock-out under the circumstances existing in this case, could it have been subjected to the penalty mentioned in that section? In my opinion it could not. It would, in my opinion, have been a sufficient answer on the part of the city to have shewn that its police employees were at work in the performance of their duties on the days on which the city was charged with having locked them out. Where the employees continue to perform their duties under their employment a lock-out cannot, in my opinion, be said to exist. As no policeman was dismissed on account of membership in any labour union, the city has not, in my opinion, contravened the provisions of the Act. The plaintiff\u2019s action must therefore fail.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgments in the courts below and enter judgment for the city with costs in all courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Damphousse, Butler & St. Pierre.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Mercier & Sullivan.\n[1] (1927) Q.R. 42 K.B., 335.\n",

[1906], c. 48) as enacted in 1925 by 15-16 Geo. V, c. 39. This enactment merely added a third subsection to the two others which were already in the Act, and it is under this third subsection that the appellant was convicted.\nIn dismissing the appellant\u2019s appeal, Mr. Justice Guerin, on behalf of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, said:\nIt was proved at the trial that this machine had been smuggled into Canada and found in the possession of the appellant.\nThereupon it devolved upon the defendant to prove his innocent possession. This the defendant failed to do. Under section 264 of the Customs Act the burden of proof was upon the appellant to show that the proper duties payable were in fact duly paid and that all the requirements of the Customs Act had been fulfilled.\nThe appellant alleges three grounds of appeal, but on one only, the question of the onus of proving guilty knowledge, did he claim before me that there was any conflict between the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench and a judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case.\nIn short, the appellant contends that in view of the word \u201cknowingly\u201d in section 219 of the Customs Act the onus was on the Crown to show that he, the appellant, knew that the customs duties had not been paid on the automobile in question.\nIn his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice Guerin relies on section 264 of the Customs Act as obliging the appellant to shew that the proper duties payable were in fact duly paid.\nThe appellant referred me to a number of cases wherein it was held that when, under the statute, the crime or offence consists in \u201cknowingly\u201d doing a certain thing, the onus of proof of the knowledge of the accused is upon the Crown.\nI need instance but two decisions of courts of appeal on which the appellant relies: The King v. Beaver[2], a judgment of the appellate court for Ontario in 1905; and The King v. Macdougall[3], a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick en banc in 1909. In both these cases the prosecution was under section 207 of the Criminal Code (at the time of the first case, that section was section 179 of the same code), for having \u201cknowingly, without lawful justification or excuse,\u201d circulated or distributed (I abbreviate) an\nobscene book or other printed, typewritten or otherwise written matter.\nIt was held, in the language of Maclaren J.A., in the first case, at p. 423, as follows:\nWith regard to the second point reserved, it was urged on behalf of the defendant, that it was not proved that she knew of the contents of the document she was distributing, and that consequently it was not done \u201cknowingly.\u201d This brings up the question, whether the onus of proof on this point was on the prosecution or the defence. In my opinion, the insertion of the word \u201cknowingly\u201d in the place where it is found makes it incumbent on the prosecution to give some evidence of knowledge.\nIn the second case, the sixth item of the reporter\u2019s head-note shews that the same opinion was expressed as to the onus. It reads as follows:\n6. The onus is upon the Crown to shew that the accused as editor and proprietor of a paper had \u201cknowingly\u201d published the obscene matter, but knowledge may be inferred, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, from proof that he had full control as to what should be published or not published, and that he published the paper under an assumed name.\nIn both cases, while the court expressed this opinion as to the burden of proof, the conviction was affirmed on the ground that knowledge of the accused could be inferred from the facts in evidence.\nThe question now is whether these decisions are decisions \u201cin a like case\u201d within the meaning of section 1024a of the Criminal Code. If they are, and if section 219 of the Customs Act were the only enactment to be considered in connection with the complaint brought against the appellant, I would hold, on the authority of The King v. Book[4], that they are in conflict with the decision from which the appellant seeks leave to appeal.\nIt is to be observed however that while in section 219 of the Customs Act and in section 207 of the Criminal Code the word \u201cknowingly\u201d is used in the definition of the offence, the Customs Act contains a section (not to be found in the Criminal Code in connection with section 207), namely section 264, dealing specially with the burden of proof. Section 264 of the Customs Act, which was not altered at the time of the enactment of section 219 in 1925, is as follows:\n264. The burden of proof that the proper duties payable with respect to any goods have been paid, and that all the requirements of this Act with regard to the entry of any goods have been complied with and fulfilled shall, in all cases, lie upon the person whose duty it was to comply with and fulfill the same, and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing provision, if any prosecution or suit is brought for any penalty or forfeiture for (sic) the recovery of any duty under this Act, or any other law relating to the customs, or to trade or navigation, or if any proceeding is taken against the Crown or any officer for the recovery of any goods seized or money deposited under the authority of this Act, or any other such law, and if any question arises as to the identity or origin of the goods seized, or as to the payment of the duties on any goods, or as to the lawful importation thereof, or as to the lawful lading or exportation of the same, or as to the doing or omission of any other thing by which such penalty or forfeiture or liability for duty would be incurred or avoided, the burden of proof shall lie on the owner or claimant of the goods seized or money deposited, and not on the Crown or on the party representing the Crown.\nThe judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench is clearly founded on section 264, under which the court held that the burden of proof was upon the appellant to shew that the proper duties had been paid. It may perhaps be open to question whether section 264 of the Customs Act applies to a prosecution under the third subsection of section 219 added by the 1925 amendment, but even were it without application, the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench would not be in conflict with the decisions above referred to where no question could arise as to such an enactment as section 264. These judgments, and the other English cases cited by the appellant to which I need not refer, were therefore not decisions \u201cin a like case,\u201d and are not in conflict with a judgment based on section 264.\nLeave to appeal must be refused.\nMotion dismissed.\n[1] (1927) Q.R. 43 K.B. 110.\n[2] 9 Can.

Act (1867) s. 91, sub. 29; s. 92, sub. 10\u2014Art. 114 C.P.C.\nA street railway company operating within a province, originally incorporated by a provincial legislature but whose undertaking was subsequently declared by a Dominion Act to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, is not subject to the jurisdiction of a public service commission created by the province, but the; execution of its powers is, by the provisions of the Railway Act, within the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Newcombe and Lamont JJ.\u2014The Railway Act of Canada applies in the present case notwithstanding an agreement between the railway appellant and the city of Quebec providing for the reconciliation of differences between them by way of appeal to the Quebec Public Service Commission; such a clause cannot be interpreted to confer authority on the commission to regulate and direct works and operations which are within the exclusive powers of the Dominion Parliament. Rinfret J. expressed the opinion that this point raised the question of the constitutionality of a provincial statute and could not therefore be heard unless a notice has been previously given to the Attorney-General (Art. 114 C.P.C.)\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Newcombe and Lamont JJ.\u2014It was in the exercise of exclusive legislative authority that the Parliament of Canada enacted the provisions of the Railway Act authorizing the Board to regulate the operations of railway companies: this plainly follows from the constitutional distribution of legislative powers by the British North America Act (s. 91, sub. 29, and s. 92, sub. 10). Moreover, the Quebec legislature has expressly limited the jurisdiction of the Quebec Public Service Commission to matters falling under the legislative authority of the province.\nPer Rinfret J.\u2014The intervention of the city of Quebec in support of the land company\u2019s complaint against the railway appellant before the Public Service Commission did not confer on the latter a jurisdiction which did not exist ab initio.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 43 K.B. 338) reversed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1] affirming a decision of the Quebec Public Service Commission and dismissing a declinatory exception as to the jurisdiction of the Commission to hear a complaint by the Montcalm Land Company against the appellant railway.\nThe material facts of the case and the question at issue are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nL. A. Cannon K.C. for the appellant.\nO. L. Boulanger K.C. and Auguste Lemieux K.C. for the respondent Montcalm Land Company.\nAuguste Lemieux K.C. for the respondent the city of Quebec.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Newcombe and Lamont J.J.) was delivered by\nNewcombe, J.\u2014The Montcalm Land Company, petitioner, now respondent, by its petition, dated 3rd June, 1926, to the Quebec Public Service Commission, sought to obtain from the Commission an order that the Quebec Railway Light and Power Co., now the appellant, should cause its tramcars to run more frequently, alleging that the appellant company was a public service within the meaning of the Public Service Commission Act of Quebec; that by contract of 24th March, 1925, between the city and the railway company, which was confirmed and validated by Act of the legislature of Quebec, c. 91 of 1926, the city had granted to the company, upon conditions provided by the contract, the renewal of its railway franchise within the city, upon the streets traversed at the date of the contract, or to which the company should extend its system with the consent of the city; that among these conditions was one which required the tramcars to run at intervals of not more than five minutes until 8 o\u2019clock in the evening; that, subject to the contract and the statute, the appellant company carried on in the city, as part of its system, a service, known as St. Sacrement or Marguerite Bourgeoys, to serve that part of the city situated in the parish of St. Sacrement; that this was a growing and important part of the city; that the petitioner had large interests there, possessing taxable property valued at $51,650; that the appellant was bound by law and by its contract to provide on that circuit a five minute service as in other parts of the city; that it had failed to give such a service, and that it was in the general interest of the inhabitants of the district, and of the petitioner especially, that the appellant should be compelled to fulfil its obligations essential to the development and progress of that quarter of the city, and to give there a five minute service; and the petitioner submitted, by way of conclusion, that the Commission should order the appellant to provide upon the circuit in question a service at intervals of not more than five minutes up to 8 o\u2019clock in the evening, and thereafter at intervals of not more than ten minutes. The appellant company pleaded a declinatory exception, dated 23rd June, alleging that the matter was not within the jurisdiction of the Quebec Public Service Commission because it (the appellant) was a corporation under the laws of the Dominion, by which its undertaking had been declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, and moreover that, by provision of the contract, it was stipulated that breaches of the appellant\u2019s obligations arising under it should be submitted to the Recorder\u2019s Court of the city of Quebec; that the city had not complained of the tramway service upon the St. Sacrement circuit, and that the petition should be dismissed.\nThe declinatory exception was heard before the Commission on 29th June. Subsequently the city pleaded an intervention, dated 30th June, though not served until 7th July, by which the city declared in support of the petition. The intervention referred to the appellant\u2019s contention that the matter was not within the jurisdiction of the Commission, and submitted that, by clause 59 of the contract, which will presently be quoted, the appellant company had accepted the Commission as the tribunal chosen for the decision of all questions relating to the interpretation and to the execution of the contract, and, moreover, repeated in substance the allegations of the petition, concluding as follows:\nPourquoi l\u2019intervenante d\u00e9clare appuyer la demande de la Montcalm Land Company Limited, afin de faire disparaitre tout doute quant \u00e0 la juridiction de la Commission des Services Publics en la pr\u00e9sente cause, et elle demande que les conclusions de la requ\u00eate de la Montcalm Land Co. Ltd. soient accord\u00e9es, et que la Quebec Railway Light & Power Company soit enjointe, par une ordonnance de cette Commission, \u00e0 faire circuler ses tramways \u00e0 des intervalles de pas plus de cinq minutes (sauf de huit heures du soir \u00e0 une heure du matin, alors que le service se fera \u00e0 des intervalles de pas plus de dix minutes) sur le circuit \u201cMarguerite-Bourgeois,\u201d le tout avec d\u00e9pens.\nApparently there was no further hearing before the Commission, but on 16th July it issued an order dismissing the declinatory motion. The order, after referring to the appellant company\u2019s Act of incorporation and to clauses 32 and 59 of the contract between it and the city, concludes as follows:\nLorsque cette motion a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec n\u2019avait pas encore pris position dans cette cause et le pr\u00e9sident de la Commission, qui doit d\u00e9cider des questions de droit et de comp\u00e9tence, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019opinion que la motion de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e, mais depuis cette date, savoir le 7 juillet, la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec est intervenue dans la cause et elle d\u00e9clare appuyer la demande de la requ\u00e9rante afin de faire dispara\u00eetre tout doute quant \u00e0 la jurisdiction de la Commission. Les all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de l\u2019intervention sont au m\u00eame effet que ceux de la requ\u00eate, de sorte que la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec se joint \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante pour nous demander de rendre l\u2019ordonnance indiqu\u00e9e aux conclusions de la requ\u00eate.\nLa loi de la Commission, qui est le chapitre 17 des statuts refondus de 1925, a \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9e par le statut 16 Geo. V, chapitre 16. En vertu de cet amendement, il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 28h, paragraphe 12, que la Commission a jurisdiction sur toute mati\u00e8re r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission par entente entre un service public et une municipalit\u00e9.\nEn pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019intervention de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, le pr\u00e9sident de la Commission est d\u2019opinion que la Commission a jurisdiction pour entendre la pr\u00e9sente demande et, en cons\u00e9quence, la Commission renvoie la dite motion d\u2019exception et ordonne aux parties de proc\u00e9der au m\u00e9rite dans le d\u00e9lai ordinaire.\nI apprehend that the city must be taken to have intervened as a person interested in the event of the proceedings between the land company and the railway company, and that the intervention is admissible and affects those proceedings only in so far as the intervenant\u2019s presence and allegations are material to maintain the petitioner\u2019s case. It is the formal and declared purpose of the intervenant to support the petitioner\u2019s conclusion, and the intervention introduces no variation of the issue, although it is perhaps suggested by the order of the Commission that, in view of the intervention, the Commission has a jurisdiction which otherwise it would not have had. It is apparent that the sole project of the proceedings, both petition and intervention, is to make use of the mandatory powers of the Commission to compel the railway company to render the service claimed, and it seems to be true, as averred in the joint factum of the two respondents, that\nthe subject matter of the petition submitted to the Quebec Public Service Commission concerns nothing but the operation of the tramways in the streets of Quebec city exclusively.\nFrom the order of the Commission the appellant appealed to the Court of King\u2019s Bench where different opinions were expressed. The appeal was heard before Green-shields, Dorion, Flynn, Allard and Howard JJ. Green-shields and Allard JJ. affirmed the jurisdiction of the Commission, holding that, in respect of the matter of complaint, the Commission had jurisdiction, notwithstanding the fact that the appellant company was incorporated by and derived its powers from the Parliament of Canada. Dorion J. considered that the decision of the Commission was not final, and therefore not appealable under the statute, and that the appeal should for that reason be rejected; while Flynn and Howard JJ. were of the opinion that the Commission was without jurisdiction and that the exception should be upheld. In the result, by the formal judgment it was found that there was no error in the judgment rendered by the Commission, and its decision was affirmed.\nIn considering the question of the jurisdiction of the Commission which is thus presented it becomes necessary to refer to the legislation affecting the case, and I shall endeavour to do so with as much brevity as possible. There are no admissions in the record, nor is there any evidence, except as arising from the statutes and the scheduled contract.\nIt appears that the Quebec, Montmorency and Charlevoix Railway Company was incorporated by the legislature of Quebec, by c. 44 of 1881, with power to build and work a railway from a point in the city of Quebec to the Saguenay river, and to construct and work branch lines, also to build bridges, wharves and all other works necessary for the construction and working of its line. Additional powers were conferred by subsequent Acts of the province, including power to sell, lease or amalgamate with any other railway company, to use electricity or other motive power besides steam, to extend the line of its railway westerly towards St. Sauveur, and, by c. 71 of 1894,\nto extend and operate its railway in the city of Quebec and the neighbourhood thereof by building branch and connecting lines in connection with its main line, and for this purpose to cross or run along any of the streets of the city of Quebec or roads in the neighbourhood thereof, and for the purpose thereof, to erect above ground all necessary constructions, including posts and other supports essential for the working of an electric railway, the whole to be subject to the consent of the council of the city of Quebec and of the Quebec North Shore Turnpike Road Trustees, and upon the conditions to be agreed upon between them and the company, with respect to the streets and roads under their respective control.\nIn the following year, c. 59 of 1895 of the Dominion, upon the recitals that the Quebec, Montmorency and Charlevoix Railway Company had been incorporated by Act of the legislature of Quebec, 44 and 45 Vict. c. 44, and that this Act had been amended by the Acts to which I have referred; that it was expedient to embody in one Act the provisions remaining in force and applicable to the company, and that the company had by its petition prayed for such consolidation, and that it be declared a body corporate within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, the undertaking of the Quebec, Montmorency and Charlevoix Railway Company was declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, and\nthe company as now organized and constituted under the said Acts of the province of Quebec is hereby declared to be a body corporate and politic within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada; and this Act and The Railway Act of Canada shall apply to the company and its undertaking, instead of the said Acts of the province of Quebec and The Railway Act of Quebec; provided that nothing in this section shall affect anything done, any rights or privileges acquired, or any liability incurred under the said Acts of the province of Quebec prior to the time of the passing of this Act,\u2014to all which rights and privileges the company shall continue to be entitled and to all of which liabilities the company shall continue to be subject.\nIt is also enacted that the company may use and employ electricity and provide for the operation and maintenance of its line as an electric system, either in whole or in part; and may lay out, construct, equip and operate the lines of railway along, over and throughout all or any of the streets in the city of Quebec, or roads in the neighbourhood thereof, or in the adjoining parishes on the north shore of the river St. Lawrence, but that no such power is to be exercised within the limits of the jurisdiction of the city of Quebec, the Quebec North Shore Turnpike Trustees or any municipality, except with the prior consent of the city, trustees or municipality respectively, and upon such conditions as they may severally consent to and agree upon. It is moreover provided, by s. 15, that\nthe company may enter into an agreement with the city of Quebec for the acquiring of the franchises, rights, immunities and privileges necessary for the construction and maintenance of a system of electric railway upon and throughout the streets of the said city;\nalso that\nthe company may acquire the privileges, franchises, railways, works, plant, equipment and materials, of the Quebec Street Railway Company and the St. John Street Railway Company, and may convert the lines of the said companies into an electric system, and may conduct and manage their affairs in such manner not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, as appears to the company most advantageous, and as is sanctioned by the city of Quebec.\nSection 17 provides that:\n17. The municipal council of any city, town, village or municipality through which the said railway is constructed may, subject to the provisions of this Act, make and enter into an agreement with the company relating to the construction of the said railway, for the paving, macadamizing, repairing and grading of the streets or highways occupied by the line of railway and the construction, opening of and repairing of drains or sewers, and the laying of gas and water-pipes in the said streets and highways, the location of the railway and the particular streets along which it shall be laid, the pattern of rails, the time and speed of running the cars, the amount of fares to be paid by passengers, and the rates to be paid on freight, the time in which the works are to be commenced, the manner of proceeding with the said works and the time for completion, and generally for the safety and convenience of passengers.\nBy c. 85 of 1899 of the Dominion, the name of the Quebec, Montmorency and Charlevoix Railway Company was changed to \u201cThe Quebec Railway, Light and Power Company\u201d, and the statute of 1895 was further amended; also the acquisition by the company of the Quebec District Railway, by deed of 29th June, 1898, and of the Montmorency Electric Power Company\u2019s property was ratified and confirmed.\nBy notarial contract of 24th March, 1925, between the city of Quebec and the Quebec Railway, Light and Power Company, which is ratified and confirmed by and made part of c. 91 of 1925 of Quebec, entitled an Act to amend the charter of the city of Quebec, it is recited that the company has built, operates and maintains a system of tramways in the city of Quebec in accordance with the provisions of a contract of 17th July, 1895, and that it is proposed to renew the franchises of the company, and it is agreed that it\nshall be lawful for the company to operate, maintain and extend under the conditions hereinafter set forth, a railway to carry passengers run by electricity or otherwise, except by steam, in the streets or parts of the streets where the tramways are presently running.\nMany details are set forth in the contract affecting the construction and operation of the company\u2019s railway, and the relations between the company and the city touching the terms and conditions of renewal of the franchise. These include, among other terms, provisions for the extension of the railway lines to other streets at the request of the city; the carriage of freight; supervision and approval by the city engineer of construction upon the streets; guage of the railway; approval of the pattern of rails to be used; removal of excavated material; indemnity to the city for costs of repair to the streets; removal of excavated material; expedition in the performance of any works undertaken by the company upon the streets; removal of snow and ice; to ensure that the cars shall not be obstructed by other vehicles; double tracks where necessary; to prevent the crowding of cars; time tables; protection against accidents; light and heat; fares; the use of Montmorency Park for the construction and working of an elevator for the company\u2019s purposes; preference in the company\u2019s employment of resident taxpayers of the city; that the company\u2019s wages shall be paid every two weeks; hours of labour; conformity to city by-laws; establishment of work-shops within the city; manufacture of rolling stock within the city; that the company shall not transfer its railway or franchises without consent of the city; that the city shall not authorize competing lines within the city; the privileges granted by the contract to endure for thirty years; procedure and expropriation in case of renewal, or failure to renew, the franchises; insolvency of the company; payment to the city every year of 5 per cent. of the company\u2019s gross receipts within the city; water and school taxes; free carriage of members of the city police force, fire brigade and signal service; transfer to the city of a parcel of land which is described, also of a public right of way upon another parcel. Clauses 31 and 32 contain the stipulations for the alleged breach of which the proceedings were taken; they provide that:\n31. The cars shall run from 5 o\u2019clock a.m. until 1 o\u2019clock a.m. on all the company\u2019s lines.\n32. The cars shall follow each other at intervals of not more than five minutes, except from 8 o\u2019clock at night until 1 o\u2019clock in the morning, during which space of time they shall follow each other at intervals of not more than 10 minutes. The council may by resolution modify the hours fixed for the tramway service in the various sections. This last provision shall be applicable only in the parts of the city where such circulation is required for the needs of the public.\nBy clause 54, if the company neglect to comply with or infringe any of the conditions or obligations imposed by the contract, it shall incur a penalty not exceeding $100 for every day of neglect, or during which it shall infringe, and it is provided that the penalty shall be recovered before the Recorder\u2019s Court of the city in the same manner as any other fine or penalty.\nBy clause 13 it is recited that the company is using the system known as the trolley system and provided that in the event of a better system coming into general use the company shall, at its expense, be bound to adopt it, subject to the decision of three arbitrators to be named.\nBy clause 50 it is provided that the company shall be entitled to renewal of its contract for a further period of thirty years, unless the city prefer to expropriate the railway system by paying the value, plus 10 per cent. which is to be ascertained by arbitrators to be appointed. The city relies upon clause 59 to justify its intervention; it is thereby provided as follows:\n59. Unless it is expressly provided for in one of the clauses of the present deed, it is expressly understood that in the event of any difficulty or difference of opinion arising between the parties, or in the event of any disagreement between them, with reference either to this deed, or to any one or all the conditions herein stipulated, or with reference to the interpretation thereof, or with reference to the execution of any or all the obligations assumed by the parties respectively, or with reference to any cause or matter relating thereto, be it foreseen or not foreseen by the present deed, the parties shall go before the Quebec Public Service Commission which they choose as a court elect, and to whose jurisdiction they shall be submitted for all the purposes hereinabove set forth.\nShould this court cease to exist, and in the event of another court being established to take its place, the latter court shall have the powers and jurisdiction of the former for the purposes of these presents.\nIf from now until then a tramway commission for the city is established, or if a provincial tramway commission is established, either one or the other of these tribunals shall have jurisdiction. It is in my view of the case unnecessary to determine precisely the application and effect of this clause. It is preceded by two clauses stipulating for the determination of questions of fact by arbitrators, and it is intended I think to provide for the reconciliation of differences which may arise between the railway company and the city within the scope of the capacity or powers with which the Commission is, by the provincial statute, competently endowed; there can be no doubt that, within these limits, the variety of the provisions of the contract, which I have endeavoured briefly to outline, affords material for the working of the clause; but it cannot be assumed, nor scarcely imagined, that the parties or the legislature intended, in framing or sanctioning such a clause, to confer authority to regulate and direct works and operations which are within the exclusive powers of Parliament. Indeed, as will presently appear, the legislature has expressly limited the jurisdiction of the Commission to matters falling under the legislative authority of the province.\nThe provisions with regard to the constitution and jurisdiction of the Quebec Public Service Commission are to be found in the Public Service Commission Act of Quebec, R.S.Q., 1925, c. 17, as amended by c. 16 of 1926. The Commission is a body consisting of not less than three nor more than four members, appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, and it has enumerated powers of regulation and control over public services within the province. \u201cPublic Service within the definition of the statute, includes every corporation other than a municipal or school corporation, that owns, operates, manages or controls any system, works, plant or equipment for the conveyance of passengers or goods over a railway or tramway; but it is declared that the application of the Act, and the jurisdiction of the Commission, extend only to matters falling under the legislative authority of the province. By division IV of the Act, as enacted by c. 16 of 1926, no public service is to begin the construction or operation of any line, plant or system without first having obtained the approval of the Commission, which is to be granted whenever, after investigation, it finds that such construction or operation is necessary or convenient for the public benefit. Charges demanded or received by any public service shall be just and reasonable, and schedules of rates, fares and tolls, and classifications and rules pertaining to the service, are to be forwarded to the Commission. The Commission has power to regulate or determine these, also the extent of the services to be rendered, and the terms and conditions upon which a public service may enter or do business within a municipality, also contestations between a public service and a municipality with regard to the performance of agreed terms and conditions; the commission having authority to change such terms and conditions as may be in its opinion necessary or desirable. The Commission also has jurisdiction in any dispute relating to tramway rates and operations that a tramway company, other than the Montreal Tramways Company, and one or more municipalities agree by resolution to submit to it, whether or not a contract exist between them, also\nin all matters referred for the decision of the Commission by agreement between any public service and any municipality or other interested party, and the decision of the Commission shall then be binding upon the parties.\nGenerally it is enacted that the Commission shall have supervision over all public services as defined by the statute\nand may make such orders regarding quality of service, equipment, appliances, safety devices, extension of works or systems, reporting, rules, regulations, requirements and practices affecting or pertaining to its charges or service and other matters, as are necessary for the safety or convenience of the public, or for the proper carrying out of any contract, charter or franchise involving the use of public property or rights.\nThe Commission may also conduct all inquiries necessary for the obtaining of information as to the manner in which any public service complies with the law, or as to any other matter or thing within the jurisdiction of the Commission.\nRigorous powers are conferred upon the Commission for the enforcement of its orders, and it may for this purpose forcibly or otherwise enter upon, seize and take possession of the whole or part of the moveable or immoveable property of a disobedient public service, with its books and offices; assume and take over the powers, rights and functions of the directors and officers of the public service, including powers of employment and dismissal of officers and servants, for such time as the Commission continues to direct the management, and all officers and servants are required to render obedience to the Commission, or those whom it places in authority in the management of all departments of the undertaking. Moreover, if it be proved that a public service has not complied with an order given by the Commission, and if the Commission be of the opinion that there are no effectual means of compelling the public service to obey such order, it shall transmit to the Attorney General a certificate of default, which, after public notice in the Quebec Official Gazette, shall be ground for an action to dissolve the public service, or to annul the letters patent incorporating it.\nThe decision of the Commission upon any question of fact within its jurisdiction is final, but, by leave of a judge, an appeal lies to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, in conformity with art. 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure, from any final decision of the Commission upon any question as to its jurisdiction or upon any question of law, except in expropriation matters.\nThe Railway Act of the Dominion, c. 68 of 1919, applies\u2019 to all railway companies and railways, except government railways, within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, and the word \u201crailway\u201d is by this Act defined to mean any railway which the company has authority to construct or operate, and, except when the context is inapplicable, includes street railway and tramway. It provides for the constitution of the Commission known as the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada. Jurisdiction is conferred upon this Board to enquire and to hear and determine any application by or on behalf of any party interested complaining that any company or person has failed to do any act, matter or thing required to be done by this (the general) Act or the special Act. There are comprehensive provisions authorizing the Board to regulate the operations of railway companies subject to the legislative authority of Canada, including, among others, s. 35 whereby it is provided that:\n35. Where it is complained by or on behalf of the Crown or any municipal or other corporation or any other person aggrieved, that the company has violated or committed a breach of an agreement between the complainant and the company\u2014or by the company that any such corporation or person has violated or committed a breach of an agreement between the company and such corporation or person,\u2014for the provision, construction, reconstruction, alteration, installation, operation, use or maintenance by the company, or by such corporation or person, of the railway or of any line of railway intended to be operated in connection with or as part of the railway, or of any structure, appliance, equipment, works, renewals or repairs upon or in connection with the railway, the Board shall hear all matters relating to such alleged violation or breach, and shall make such order as to the Board may seem reasonable and expedient, and in such order may, in its discretion, direct the company, or such corporation or person, to do such things as are necessary for the proper fulfilment of such agreement, or to refrain from doing such acts as constitute a violation or a breach thereof.\nDecisions or orders of the Board may be made a rule, order or decree of the Exchequer Court, or of any superior court of any province of Canada, and shall be enforced in like manner as any decree or order of such court, and any rule, regulation, order or decision of the Board shall, when published by the Board, or by leave of the Board, for three weeks in the Canada Gazette, and while the same remains in force, have the like effect, as if enacted in the Railway Act, and all courts shall take judicial notice thereof.\nTherefore, if the appellant company have the powers which the respondents are endeavouring to compel it, by the authority of the Quebec Public Service Commission, to execute, the execution of these powers by the company is, by the provisions of the Railway Act, within the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada to direct and regulate subject to the provisions of that Act. It was in the exercise of exclusive legislative authority that the Parliament of Canada enacted these provisions of the Railway Act; this plainly follows from the constitutional distribution of legislative powers. It was said by Lord Atkinson, pronouncing the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway,[2],\nNow the effect of subsection 10 of s. 92 of the British North America Act is, their Lordships think, to transfer the excepted works mentioned in sub-heads (a), (b) and (c) of it into s. 91, and thus to place them under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of the Dominion Parliament.\nThese two sections must be read and construed as if these transferred subjects were especially enumerated in s. 91, and local railway as distinct from federal railway were specifically enumerated in s. 92.\nSee also Madden v. Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway Company[3]; Toronto v. Bell Telephone Company[4], Moreover, not only are the works, including railways, described in clause 10 of s. 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, thus affirmatively declared to be within exclusive Dominion authority, but it is expressly provided by clause 29 of s. 91 that they are excluded from the matters assigned to the legislatures.\nNow the principal argument of the respondents rests upon the ground that, when, in 1895, by c. 59 of the Dominion, the undertaking of the Quebec, Montmorency and Charlevoix Railway Company was declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, the Quebec Electric Street Railway did not, it is said, form part of that undertaking or work, and that the tramway, being in its nature a local work, was not affected by the declaration, and therefore never became subject to the legislation or powers of Parliament. I find it difficult to realize however that the operation of any street railway at Quebec which the company was authorized to construct or acquire was not intended to be embraced in the declaration. It is certainly not open to question that at the time of the declaration the provincial undertaking of the company included powers to construct and operate by electricity a railway upon the streets of Quebec, and it appears by recital in the scheduled contract that the system of appellant\u2019s tramways had been built and was being operated and maintained under the provisions of a contract of 17th July, 1895, a date five days antecedent to the Act, c. 59 of 1895 of Canada, by which the company became a Dominion corporation, and by which its undertaking was declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada.\nBut I do not find it necessary to determine the scope of these powers, or the extent of the declaration, or whether it includes the tramway as subsequently acquired or constructed. The Dominion statutes relating to the appellant company are so expressed as to confer or recognize the electric tramway powers which the appellant company is exercising, and, by the legislation of 1895, the company had acquired Dominion capacity and powers with which the provincial legislature could not interfere.\nNow, as I have said, the object of the respondents proceedings is to invoke the statutory powers of the Public Service Commission of Quebec for the purpose of compelling the appellant railway to operate its trams in accordance with the requirements of the local Act of 1925, as interpreted by the Commission. The jurisdiction invoked is that of the local statutory Board, not that of the ordinary tribunals, and that jurisdiction, with the extraordinary powers which the Commission possesses, is set in motion against the Dominion corporation for the regulation of railway powers conferred by the Dominion, or which Parliament professes to confer. If, as would seem to follow from the respondent\u2019s argument, these tramway powers be ultra vires of the Dominion, the petition and intervention fail because the appellant company cannot, by authority of a statute of Quebec, be compelled to execute powers which do not belong to it; while, if the powers exist and may be exercised, they are Dominion powers and not within the authority of the legislature of Quebec. There is an apposite passage in the judgment of the Lord Chancellor in Madden v. Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway Company[5],\nIt would have been impossible, as it appears to their Lordships, to maintain the authority of the Dominion Parliament if the provincial parliament were to be permitted to enter into such a field of legislation, which is wholly withdrawn from them and is, therefore, manifestly ultra vires.\nOne must look to what the respondents\u2019 claim involves; it is nothing less than provincial statutory compulsion of a Dominion railway corporation, either to exercise powers which Parliament has not conferred, or, in the exercise of its competent Dominion powers, to submit to provincial review and regulation, followed in either case by the consequence that, for failure to comply with the provincial order, the company may forcibly be deprived of its property, powers, rights and management, and ultimately subjected to an action for its dissolution; and this notwithstanding what is undoubtedly true that neither the constitution and powers of the company nor its authorized undertaking is subject to the legislative authority of the province. It is needless to say that these things cannot be done.\nThis conclusion disposes of all the grounds upon which the respondents rely in support of the petition, and it is unnecessary to make any observations upon that part of the appellant\u2019s case which is concerned with the Recorder\u2019s Court of Quebec.\nThe respondents raised a preliminary point that this Court had not jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. It was said that the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench was not pronounced in a judicial proceeding, and was not final. The answer is to be found in the definition of \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d and of \u201cfinal judgment\u201d as contained in the Supreme Court Act, see c. 32 of 1920, s. 1. The Court of King\u2019s Bench in disposing of the appeal from the Public Service Commission was not exercising merely regulative, administrative, or executive jurisdiction, and the judgment of that court determined a substantive right of the appellant which was in controversy in that proceeding.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the petition and intervention should be dismissed, with costs throughout.\nRinfret j.\u2014The Quebec Railway, Light & Power Company est une corporation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale soumise \u00e0 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative du Parlement du Canada et, en particulier, au contr\u00f4le de la Commission des Chemins de fer du Canada.\nThe Montcalm Land Company, par voie de requ\u00eate, s\u2019est adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission des Services Publics de Qu\u00e9bec pour obtenir de cette derni\u00e8re un ordre enjoignant \u00e0 The Quebec Railway Company de faire circuler ses tramways sur un circuit d\u00e9sign\u00e9 \u00e0\ndes intervalles de pas plus de cinq minutes, sauf de huit heures du soir \u00e0 une heure du matin, alors que le service se fera \u00e0 des intervalles de pas plus de dix minutes.\nLa Commission des Services Publics de Qu\u00e9bec, qui est un corps cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec et investi de pouvoirs exclusivement provinciaux (R.S.Q. 1925, c. 17), n\u2019avait pas juridiction pour conna\u00eetre de cette requ\u00eate.\nThe Quebec Railway Company d\u00e9clina donc la comp\u00e9tence de la Commission par voie d\u2019exception d\u00e9clinatoire.\nL\u00e0-dessus, la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, invoquant un contrat entre elle et The Quebec Railway Company, intervint volontairement dans l\u2019instance pour\nappuyer la demande de The Montcalm Land Company Limited, afin de faire dispara\u00eetre tout doute quant \u00e0 la juridiction de la Commission des Services Publics en la pr\u00e9sente cause, et demanda\nque les conclusions de The Montcalm Land Company Limited soient accord\u00e9es.\nSur quoi le pr\u00e9sident, au nom de la Commission des Services Publics, rendit une ordonnance en date du 16 juillet 1926 d\u00e9clarant que, sans l\u2019intervention de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, il e\u00fbt\n\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019opinion que l\u2019exception d\u00e9clinatoire \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e,\nmais que l\u2019intervention de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec avait remis les choses au point.\nLe contrat entre la cit\u00e9 et The Quebec Railway Company pr\u00e9voit que.\nles parties devront s\u2019adresser \u00e0 la Commission des Services Publics de Qu\u00e9bec, qu\u2019elles choisissent comme tribunal \u00e9lu et \u00e0 la juridicition de laquelle elles seront soumises pour toutes les fins ci-haut exprim\u00e9es.\nEn plus, depuis le statut 16 Geo. V, chapitre 16, la Commission a juridiction\nsur toutes mati\u00e8res r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 la commission par entente entre un service public et une municipalit\u00e9 ou autre partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, et sa d\u00e9cision est alors obligatoire pour les parties.\nLe pr\u00e9sident d\u00e9cida donc que, en pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019intervention de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, la Commission avait juridiction en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nCette d\u00e9cision ne fut pas mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi par suite des circonstances suivantes: un juge fut d\u2019avis que la d\u00e9cision n\u2019\u00e9tait pas finale et que le droit d\u2019en appeler n\u2019existait pas. Deux des juges furent d\u2019avis que la Commission \u00e9tait comp\u00e9tente sur la requ\u00eate de la seule compagnie Montcalm et ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019intervention de la cit\u00e9. Les deux autres juges, au contraire, exprim\u00e8rent l\u2019opinion qu\u2019il y avait d\u00e9faut absolu de juridiction sur la requ\u00eate de la compagnie Montcalm, m\u00eame avec l\u2019appui de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec.\nLa question nous est maintenant soumise, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une permission sp\u00e9ciale octroy\u00e9e par la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nJe suis d\u2019avis que le pourvoi en appel de The Quebec Railway Company doit \u00eatre accueilli pour la raison qui suit:\nLa Commission des Services Publics de Qu\u00e9bec n\u2019est pas comp\u00e9tente \u00e0 conna\u00eetre de la requ\u00eate de la compagnie Montcalm, parce qu\u2019elle prend des conclusions et demande des injonctions contre une compagnie f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et en des mati\u00e8res qui rel\u00e8vent de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Il ne s\u2019agit ici nullement de la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la commission par entente entre un service public et une municipalit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 12 de l\u2019article 28h de la loi de 1926 (16 Geo. V, c. 16). Cet article ne pourrait d\u2019ailleurs avoir son effet qu\u2019entre le service public et la municipalit\u00e9 qui auraient convenu de la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\nL\u2019intervention de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec n\u2019a pu modifier le caract\u00e8re originaire de l\u2019instance. D\u2019une requ\u00eate concluant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9mission d\u2019ordres imp\u00e9ratifs, elle n\u2019a pu faire une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Et si la commission manquait de la juridiction n\u00e9cessaire pour conna\u00eetre de l\u2019instance originaire, l\u2019intervention de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette instance et pour faire accorder les conclusions de la requ\u00eate de la compagnie Montcalm n\u2019a pu conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 la Commission une juridiction qui faisait d\u00e9faut ab initio. L\u2019intervention n\u2019a pas transform\u00e9 la nature de la demande.\nAinsi, (dit Glasson, Proc\u00e9dure Civile, \u00e9d. de Tissier, vol. 1, p. 940), si l\u2019instance principale est annul\u00e9e, par exemple pour nullit\u00e9 de l\u2019ajournement ou pour cause d\u2019incomp\u00e9tence, l\u2019intervention tombe avec l\u2019instance principale. .\nDe m\u00eame Japiot, dans son Trait\u00e9 de Proc\u00e9dure, p. 517, no. 828:\nL\u2019intervention est une demande principale, mais non introductive d\u2019instance, et par suite non soumise au pr\u00e9liminaire de conciliation. Mais elle suppose un proc\u00e8s d\u00e9j\u00e0 engag\u00e9 et constitue un d\u00e9veloppement, une extension de l\u2019instance pr\u00e9-existante; elle en implique la validit\u00e9; les juges ne pourraient pas prononcer sur la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019intervenant, si la demande originaire \u00e9tait repouss\u00e9e pour incomp\u00e9tence du tribunal ou pour vice de forme ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 l\u2019intervention.\nPour ces raisons, je crois que l\u2019intervention de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec n\u2019a pu apporter \u00e0 la Commission des Services Publics une juridiction qui lui faisait d\u00e9faut d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l\u2019instance. La requ\u00eate de la compagnie Montcalm devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e faute de comp\u00e9tence et l\u2019intervention tombait avec elle.\nJe crois donc l\u2019appel bien fond\u00e9. Il devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens devant cette cour et devant la Cour du Banc du Roi et l\u2019exception d\u00e9clinatoire devrait \u00eatre maintenue.\nLe jugement ainsi formul\u00e9 ne prononce pas sur une simple question de proc\u00e9dure. Il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019une question de juridiction. Et la solution est suffisante pour trancher le point en litige.\nJ\u2019ai pris connaissance du jugement de mon coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Newcombe, auquel j\u2019ai compris que la majorit\u00e9 de la cour avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de se rallier. A mon humble avis, ce jugement exprime des vues sur la validit\u00e9 de la clause de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence contenue dans le contrat entre la cit\u00e9 et la compagnie (clause 59) et dans la loi de la Commission des Services Publics (16 Geo. V, c. 16, art. 28h, par. 12).\nLe contrat entre la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec et la Quebec Railway Company est devenu loi de la province (1925, c. 91, art. 5). Cette cour, exer\u00e7ant sa juridiction d\u2019appel, doit rendre le jugement qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre prononc\u00e9 par le tribunal dont est appel (Loi de la Cour Supr\u00eame, art. 51). Dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, la Cour du Banc du Roi de la province n\u2019aurait pu adjuger sur la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019article discut\u00e9 de la Loi des Services Publics ou de la clause du contrat sans qu\u2019un avis f\u00fbt donn\u00e9 au Procureur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, conform\u00e9ment au Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile, art. 114. La prescription est imp\u00e9rative (Le Roi v. Carrier), (1) et n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Tr\u00e8s respectueusement, je crois que l\u2019avis au Procureur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e9tait une condition pr\u00e9alable obligatoire, avant de mettre en question la validit\u00e9 de ces lois.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taschereau, Cannon, Parent & Taschereau.\nSolicitor for the respondent Montcalm Land Company: Oscar Boulanger.\nSolicitors for the respondent The City of Quebec: Chapleau & Th\u00e9riault.\n[1] (1927) Q.R., 43 K.B. 338.\n[2] [1912] A.C. 333, at p. 342.\n[3] [1899] A.C. 626.\n[4] [1905] A.C. 52, at p. 57.\n[5] [1899] A.C. 626, at p. 628.\n",

But the facts were that the amount of $8,000 was formed by a sum of $6,000 then due to D. by the husband of R. and $2,000 to be advanced in the future by D. and used \u201cin the construction of buildings on the property\u201d sold. In a counter-letter signed on the same date as the deed of sale, R., falsely admitting that she was indebted to D. in a sum of $8,000 on promissory notes, declared that she was selling the above property to D. in payment of that debt; and it was further stipulated that the property would be returned to R. when reimbursed, by R. or her husband, of the moneys advanced by him, including the sum of $8,000.\nHeld that the deed of sale was void and of no effect under the terms of article 1301 C.C. No sale was ever intended between the parties and R. never had the intention of selling her property and using the proceeds to pay immediately the debts of her husband, as she had the right to do; but she in fact pledged her property in order to obtain delay from the creditor of her husband and was thus binding herself to pay his debts in the future.\nHeld, although it has been decided that the nature or form of an agreement should be considered by the courts without looking into the motives or purposes which the parties may have had in view (Salvos v. Vassal (27 Can. S.C.R. 68) and Booth v. McLean ([1923] S.C.R. 243)), that principle of law does not apply to persons incapable of contracting and specially to a married woman binding herself in a contract with or for her husband, as otherwise the parties would be able to evade the prescriptions of article 1301 C.C. by giving an apparent valid title to a transaction forbidden by law.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nOn 24th January, 1920, the appellant, Dame Desilda Rodrigue, wife separated as to property of Philibert Fortin, sold a property situated in the township of Dudswell, in the county of Wolfe, in the district of St. Francis, to the respondent, Thomas Dostie, for a price stated in the deed of sale to be $8,000 and for which a general acquittance was given. As a matter of fact, the true consideration was a discharge given by Dostie to Fortin for $6,000 which Fortin owed Dostie, and the promise of a further loan by Dostie to Fortin of $2,000, which the latter required to enable him to build a barn and a house on the property.\nOn the same day the parties executed a counter-letter, from which it appears that the appellant had given to Dostie promissory notes aggregating what Dostie is said to have paid for the property ($8,000) maturing at different dates; that in payment of said notes the appellant had that day sold the property to Dostie; and that Dostie agreed to cede it back to her if and when she or her husband repaid to him the $8,000 with interest at 8 per cent. per annum, and any other advances that he might make to either of them up to the time of the redemption of the property. This counter-letter was not registered.\nBy her action appellant alleged that the sale by her to Dostie of the 24th January, 1920, was absolutely null, as being against public order, because a wife cannot obligate herself for her husband.\nR. Beaudoin K.C. for the appellant.\nL\u00e9on Faribault K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une action o\u00f9 une femme mari\u00e9e, Dame Desilda Rodrigue, l\u2019appelante, invoque, l\u2019article 1301 du code civil pour conclure \u00e0 la nullit\u00e9 d\u2019un acte de vente \u00e0 Thomas Dostie, l\u2019un des intim\u00e9s, en date du 24 janvier 1920. Apr\u00e8s avoir fait enregistrer cet acte de vente en sa faveur, Dostie a accord\u00e9 une hypoth\u00e8que \u00e0 Vachon, l\u2019autre intim\u00e9. L\u2019appelante a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 la radiation de l\u2019enregistrement de cette hypoth\u00e8que, parce qu\u2019elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 consentie frauduleusement et par une personne qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u00e9galement propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019immeuble. L\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend, en effet, que si l\u2019acte de vente \u00e0 Dostie \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public et, par suite, frapp\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9 absolue, Dostie, n\u2019ayant aucun droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ne pouvait affecter l\u2019immeuble d\u2019une hypoth\u00e8que. L\u2019action r\u00e9clame, en outre, l\u2019annulation de certaines obligations et le remboursement de certains paiements qui furent la cons\u00e9quence de l\u2019acte de vente dont elle invoque la nullit\u00e9.\nLe jugement de premi\u00e8re instance fut \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la preuve et le plaidoyer de Dostie d\u00e9montraient clairement que la vente du 24 janvier 1920 avait pour but de faire garantir par l\u2019appelante la cr\u00e9ance de Dostie contre son mari, dont elle est s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens. Il en r\u00e9sultait que l\u2019obligation ainsi souscrite \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale comme se trouvant en contravention \u00e0 l\u2019article 1301 du code civil.\nPartant, l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que enregistr\u00e9e le 21 ao\u00fbt 1923 * * * en faveur du mis-en-cause Vachon \u00e9tait nulle et sans effet en autant qu\u2019elle peut affecter les dits biens. L\u2019action fut maintenue sur ces deux points, la cour\nconsid\u00e9rant qu\u2019il ne para\u00eet pas opportun de statuer pr\u00e9sentement, et dans cette instance, sur les autres conclusions de l\u2019action.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a infirm\u00e9 ce jugement, sauf la dissidence de monsieur le juge L\u00e9tourneau qui partageait l\u2019opinion de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Monsieur le juge Dorion vit, dans la transaction dont il s\u2019agit, une v\u00e9ritable ali\u00e9nation de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 faite par l\u2019appelante en paiement des dettes de son mari, sans enfreindre l\u2019article 1301 du code civil, qui d\u00e9fend les obligations contract\u00e9es par la femme avec ou pour son mari, mais nullement l\u2019emploi qu\u2019elle peut faire du prix de vente. Les trois autres juges, formant la majorit\u00e9, consid\u00e9r\u00e8rent que l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait sans int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 demander l\u2019annulation de la vente et la radiation de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que. En effet, le 20 ao\u00fbt 1923, Dostie avait revendu la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelante et, depuis lors, cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie et adjug\u00e9e en justice par le sh\u00e9rif. La vente originaire \u00e9tait donc devenue sans effet et l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que avait \u00e9t\u00e9 purg\u00e9e.\nIl ne subsistait m\u00eame pas l\u2019utilit\u00e9 de faire reconna\u00eetre l\u2019inexistence de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que, puisque le rapport de distribution avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e0 la suite de la vente du sh\u00e9rif et le cr\u00e9ancier Vachon n\u2019y \u00e9tait pas colloque. Il est vrai que Vachon contestait le rapport de distribution; mais, dans ce cas, c\u2019\u00e9tait en intervenant dans cette contestation que l\u2019appelante devait faire reconna\u00eetre ses droits.\nL\u2019action de la demanderesse devait donc \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e faute d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat.\nCette raison, qui fut celle de la majorit\u00e9 des juges, n\u2019est pas consign\u00e9e dans le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi. Cette cour,\nproc\u00e9dant \u00e0 rendre le jugement qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rendu, renvoie l\u2019action de l\u2019intim\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens (parce que) la dite vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 du 24 janvier 1920 n\u2019est pas un acte simul\u00e9 mais une v\u00e9ritable ali\u00e9nation de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e * * * que le paiement de la dette de son mari par l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne rend pas nulle l\u2019ali\u00e9nation de la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 * * * que la prohibition contenue dans l\u2019article 1301 du Code Civil s\u2019applique aux obligations contract\u00e9es par la femme, mais nullement \u00e0 l\u2019emploi qu\u2019elle peut faire du prix de vente, m\u00eame si cet emploi est pr\u00e9vu par l\u2019acte argu\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 Vachon, qui n\u2019avait pas produit de plaidoyer devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, s\u2019\u00e9tait joint \u00e0 Dostie pour demander \u00e0 la Cour du Banc du Roi l\u2019infirmation du jugement qui avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 son hypoth\u00e8que nulle et sans effet. D\u2019autre part, il est ici, devant la Cour Supr\u00eame, pour appuyer le jugement que nous venons de r\u00e9sumer.\nIl sera plus avantageux de prendre en consid\u00e9ration s\u00e9par\u00e9ment la contestation avec Dostie et la contestation avec Vachon.\nLe contrat de l\u2019appelante en faveur de Dostie est en apparence une vente pure et simple de trois lots dans le canton de Dudswell. Le prix est\nde $8,000 que la demanderesse reconna\u00eet avoir re\u00e7ues du dit acqu\u00e9reur par avances faites avant ce jour, dont quittance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nIl est \u00e9tabli\u2014il est, de fait, implicitement admis par Dostie\u2014que cette d\u00e9claration est inexacte. L\u2019appelante n\u2019avait absolument rien re\u00e7u de Dostie avant la passation de l\u2019acte de vente. La somme de $8,000, ainsi que l\u2019admet le plaidoyer amend\u00e9, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9e d\u2019un montant de $6,000 d\u00fb \u00e0 Dostie par le mari de l\u2019appelante et d\u2019une somme additionnelle de $2,000 que Dostie devait fournir de temps \u00e0 autre pour \u201cservir \u00e0 la construction de b\u00e2tisses sur le terrain.\u201d Il est donc indiscutable, m\u00eame si l\u2019on envisage le contrat de vente seul, qu\u2019il fut consenti en grande partie pour les affaires du mari. Quant aux $2,000 qui devaient \u00eatre employ\u00e9es \u00e0 des constructions, la preuve n\u2019indique pas que cette somme particuli\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie par Dostie. Il a pay\u00e9 des traites et des ch\u00e8ques apr\u00e8s la vente. Ils sont d\u2019ailleurs \u00e0 l\u2019ordre du mari de l\u2019appelante et il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 de quelle mani\u00e8re on en avait utilis\u00e9 le produit.\nCependant, en m\u00eame temps que le contrat de vente, les parties sign\u00e8rent une contre-lettre. Cette derni\u00e8re d\u00e9bute comme suit:\nAttendu que la dite dame Fortin (l\u2019appelante) \u00e9tait endett\u00e9e envers le dit Thomas Dostie d\u2019une somme de $8,000 qu\u2019elle lui devait par divers billets promissoires payables \u00e0 la date indiqu\u00e9e en chacun des dits billets promissoires.\nC\u2019\u00e9tait, l\u00e0 encore, une fausse d\u00e9claration. Nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu que l\u2019appelante n\u2019\u00e9tait nullement endett\u00e9e envers Dostie. En plus, si l\u2019on prenait cette affirmation \u00e0 la lettre, il s\u2019ensuivrait que l\u2019appelante aurait souscrit des billets promissoires \u00e0 Dostie pour la dette de son mari; et ce serait l\u00e0, \u00e0 sa face m\u00eame, une obligation assum\u00e9e par la femme \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019article 1301 du code civil. En s\u2019arr\u00eatant uniquement \u00e0 cette partie du pr\u00e9ambule de la contre-lettre, la transaction appara\u00eetrait vici\u00e9e \u00e0 sa base. Poursuivons cependant l\u2019examen de cette contre-lettre. Elle d\u00e9clare ensuite que \u201cpour se lib\u00e9rer du paiement des dits billets promissoires\u201d l\u2019appelante, autoris\u00e9e de son \u00e9poux, a vendu \u00e0 Dostie les trois lots du canton de Dudswell\nainsi que le roulant de sucrerie et les effets mobiliers dont elle a la possession.\nDostie consent \u00e0 ce que ces biens soient r\u00e9troc\u00e9d\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appelante\nlorsqu\u2019il aura \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 par la venderesse ou par le dit Philibert Fortin de la dite somme de $8,000 prix de vente stipul\u00e9 en la vente, en date de ce jour, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de huit pour cent par an, payable annuellement \u00e0 compter de ce jour et de toutes autres avances d\u2019argent qu\u2019il pourrait faire \u00e0 l\u2019un ou \u00e0 l\u2019autre, d\u2019hui au rachat des susdits biens;\nConvenu que le dit Thomas Dostie, pour lui et ses ayants-droits, s\u2019engage \u00e0 r\u00e9troc\u00e9der les dits biens, meubles et immeubles, et \u00e0 en signer un acte notari\u00e9, \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019un d\u2019eux, aussit\u00f4t qu\u2019il aura \u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9gralement pay\u00e9, en capital et int\u00e9r\u00eats, au taux de huit pour cent tant de la susdite somme de $8,000, prix de vente sus-mentionn\u00e9, que de toutes autres avances en argent qu\u2019il pourra leur avoir faites, d\u2019hui \u00e0 ce que la demande lui soit faite, par l\u2019un ou par l\u2019autre, de leur signer un acte de r\u00e9trocession des biens sus-mentionn\u00e9s.\nIl est. \u00e9vident que les parties ont voulu que le contrat de vente et la contre-lettre ne forment qu\u2019une seule convention. Cela est d\u2019ailleurs clairement d\u00e9montr\u00e9 par les admissions du plaidoyer, par les circonstances et par la preuve.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi, qui a maintenu la validit\u00e9 de la transaction, la consid\u00e8re comme une \u201cvente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9,\u201d ce qui ne peut exister qu\u2019en envisageant la vente et la contre-lettre comme un seul contrat.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s les termes m\u00eames de la convention, l\u2019appelante aurait donc engag\u00e9 ses immeubles de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ne pouvoir les racheter que moyennant le remboursement des avances d\u2019argent que Dostie pourrait faire \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame ou \u00e0 son mari; et la stipulation est que Dostie r\u00e9troc\u00e9dera les biens \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019un d\u2019eux.\nCette constatation n\u2019est pas d\u00e9cisive; mais, en vue des autres faits qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9s, elle est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment important pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u2019une obligation par une femme mari\u00e9e \u201cavec ou pour son mari\u201d autrement qu\u2019en sa qualit\u00e9 de commune en biens.\nCe contrat ne changea rien \u00e0 la situation de l\u2019appelante, Dostie lui laissant la libre possession de ses immeubles. Elle continua de les cultiver \u00e0 sa guise et d\u2019en retirer les fruits. Elle y fit d\u2019importantes coupes de bois; elle en enleva les b\u00e2tisses et en construisit de nouvelles. C\u2019\u00e9tait d\u2019ailleurs la convention entre les parties; et l\u2019indication la plus positive qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019une v\u00e9ritable vente et que Dostie n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de prendre possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, c\u2019est justement sa pr\u00e9tention que l\u2019une des consid\u00e9rations du contrat \u00e9tait qu\u2019il devait fournir de l\u2019argent \u00e0 l\u2019appelante et \u00e0 son mari pour leur permettre de construire de nouvelles b\u00e2tisses sur les terrains. Un acheteur ne fournit pas, comme partie de son prix d\u2019achat, les fonds n\u00e9cessaires pour permettre au vendeur de faire sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue de nouvelles constructions qui appartiendront \u00e0 ce vendeur.\nIl convient de signaler, en outre, que la contre-lettre ne fixe aucun d\u00e9lai dans lequel il sera permis \u00e0 l\u2019appelante ou \u00e0 son \u00e9poux de racheter les biens qui en font l\u2019objet. Sans doute la loi limite le droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 dix ans; mais cette absence d\u2019une stipulation formelle n\u2019en sert pas moins \u00e0 souligner davantage que les parties n\u2019avaient pas en vue une v\u00e9ritable translation de propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nC\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs ce que l\u2019appelante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate, sans objection ni contradiction. Apr\u00e8s avoir affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne devait rien \u00e0 Dostie, on lui demande comment Dostie s\u2019y est pris pour l\u2019induire \u00e0 faire ce contrat. Elle r\u00e9pond:\nIl m\u2019a dit que c\u2019\u00e9tait pour garantir l\u2019argent que mon mari pouvait lui devoir * * * Je ne l\u2019ai pas fait beaucoup de bon coeur * * * C\u2019est parce qu\u2019il me for\u00e7ait de lui donner des garanties.\nLa fausset\u00e9 des d\u00e9clarations contenues dans les documents \u00e9crits et la conduite des parties viennent confirmer les affirmations de l\u2019appelante et justifient la d\u00e9cision du juge du proc\u00e8s que v\u00e9ritablement les parties n\u2019ont eu en vue qu\u2019une garantie par la femme mari\u00e9e des dettes de son mari. Toutes les circonstances d\u00e9montrent que c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0 leur intention et tous les participants semblent avoir compris que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait donn\u00e9e simplement en garantie. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, ce sont certainement l\u00e0 les repr\u00e9sentations que l\u2019on a faites \u00e0 l\u2019appelante, qui l\u2019ont induite \u00e0 signer les contrats, et sans lesquelles elle n\u2019y aurait jamais consenti.\nEn ce qui la concerne, elle n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019intention de vendre ou de donner ses immeubles en paiement des dettes de son mari. Elle n\u2019a vu dans toute cette transaction que la mise en gage ou le nantissement de ses biens pour emp\u00eacher un cr\u00e9ancier de son mari de s\u00e9vir contre ce dernier et obtenir un r\u00e9pit pendant lequel les dettes pourraient \u00eatre acquitt\u00e9es.\nC\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour \u00e9viter une situation de ce genre et pour prot\u00e9ger la femme mari\u00e9e en pareille occurrence que l\u2019article 1301 C.C. a \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9 dans le code civil. L\u2019on permet \u00e0 la femme mari\u00e9e de donner ou de payer imm\u00e9diament; on lui d\u00e9fend de s\u2019obliger \u00e0 payer \u00e0 une date future. Elle peut ali\u00e9ner ses biens, mais elle ne peut les engager; et la raison en est, d\u2019apr\u00e8s Pothier, qui s\u2019inspire d\u2019Ulpien, que s\u2019il s\u2019agit de se d\u00e9pouiller imm\u00e9diatement la femme mari\u00e9e y songera s\u00e9rieusement, tandis qu\u2019elle se laissera persuader assez facilement de prendre une obligation pour l\u2019avenir;\nil est plus facile d\u2019obtenir de la femme une promesse qu\u2019une donation.\nC\u2019est bien par l\u00e0 que p\u00e8chent, nous semble-t-il, les conventions attaqu\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante. La loi d\u00e9fend \u00e0 la femme mari\u00e9e de s\u2019obliger avec ou pour son mari. C\u2019est une l\u00e9gislation inspir\u00e9e dans un but de protection pour la femme. Ce n\u2019est pas parce que les parties auront donn\u00e9 \u00e0 leur convention la forme d\u2019un achat, d\u2019une vente, d\u2019un \u00e9change d\u2019immeubles ou d\u2019un bail emphyth\u00e9otique qu\u2019elles pourront ainsi se soustraire \u00e0 la prohibition de la loi.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi et le Conseil Priv\u00e9, dans la cause de Trust & Loan v. Gauthier[1], ont \u00e9tabli que la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ordre public contenue dans l\u2019article 1301 C.C. ne saurait \u00eatre frustr\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re indirecte et que, quels que soient les moyens d\u00e9tourn\u00e9s employ\u00e9s pour l\u2019\u00e9luder, d\u00e8s que les faits viendront \u00e0 la connaissance du tribunal, il annulera toute obligation contract\u00e9e directement ou indirectement par la femme en violation de cet article. C\u2019est un principe que cette cour a elle-m\u00eame affirm\u00e9 dans la cause de Klock v. Chamberlin[2]. En pareille mati\u00e8re, l\u2019enqu\u00eate du juge ne saurait \u00eatre limit\u00e9e par les \u00e9nonciations du contrat, ni se laisser arr\u00eater par les expressions contenues dans les actes. Au del\u00e0 des termes, il recherchera si la convention ne constitue pas une violation d\u00e9guis\u00e9e.\nTout d\u00e9montre que nous sommes ici en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un cas de ce genre. Il n\u2019y a pas eu de vente bona fide; il n\u2019y a pas m\u00eame eu de vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9. Les contrats ne d\u00e9voilent pas les v\u00e9ritables intentions des parties. S\u2019il iaut, comme cette cour l\u2019a fait dans la cause de Salvas v. Vassal[3] et plus r\u00e9cemment encore dans la cause de Booth v. McLean[4], \u00e9viter de rechercher les motifs ou le but imm\u00e9diat ou ult\u00e9rieur ainsi que les r\u00e9sultats possibles et probables que les parties avaient en vue et se borner \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer\nla nature de la convention qu\u2019elles avaient l\u2019intention de faire et qu\u2019en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 elles ont faite,\ncela ne peut s\u2019entendre que de la convention entre personnes capables de contracter et qui ont voulu donner \u00e0 une transaction licite la forme qu\u2019elles ont librement d\u00e9cid\u00e9e entre elles. Il est exact de dire que, dans ce cas, un emprunt sous forme d\u2019une vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 sera toujours une vente entre les parties et sera envisag\u00e9e comme telle par les tribunaux, sauf le cas de fraude \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des tiers.\nMais il est \u00e9vident que si l\u2019on appliquait ce principe aux contrats consentis par la femme mari\u00e9e avec ou pour son mari, l\u2019on permettrait aux parties d\u2019\u00e9luder la loi en donnant toute cr\u00e9ance \u00e0 des actes en apparence valides mais qui sont faits en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 dans le but de d\u00e9naturer les transactions.\nQuelles que soient les voies indirectes qui sont employ\u00e9es pour obtenir l\u2019obligation de la femme mari\u00e9e, la nullit\u00e9 d\u2019ordre public \u00e9dict\u00e9e par l\u2019article 1301 C.C. doit recevoir tout son effet du moment qu\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 d\u2019une fa\u00e7on satisfaisante que les parties contractantes ont cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 enfreindre la loi.\nNous sommes donc d\u2019accord avec le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et monsieur le juge L\u00e9tourneau pour voir une pareille infraction dans la convention dont il s\u2019agit dans cette instance; et c\u2019est avec raison, suivant nous, que l\u2019acte de vente du 24 janvier 1920 entre l\u2019appelante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e Dostie a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul et sans effet et a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nNous croyons \u00e9galement que l\u2019appelante avait int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 faire constater et d\u00e9clarer la nullit\u00e9 de cette vente afin de se faire lib\u00e9rer de toutes les obligations qui en ont \u00e9t\u00e9 la cons\u00e9quence.\nPar l\u2019acte du 20 ao\u00fbt 1923, Dostie a remis \u00e0 l\u2019appelante le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aux biens qui avaient fait l\u2019objet de la premi\u00e8re vente. Mais, pour rentrer en possession de son titre, l\u2019appelante a d\u00fb signer en faveur de Dostie un billet de $4,000, lui faire payer par le mis-en-cause Beaudoin une autre somme de $2,000 et assumer d\u2019autres obligations personnelles. Par suite de l\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 et de la nullit\u00e9 du contrat consenti le 24 janvier 1920, ces paiements et obligations \u00e9taient sans consid\u00e9ration. Elle n\u2019avait pas besoin de se faire r\u00e9troc\u00e9der le titre \u00e0 des biens dont elle n\u2019avait jamais l\u00e9galement cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre propri\u00e9taire. Le jugement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9 par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure lui est utile pour servir de base \u00e0 un refus de payer le billet de $4,000, \u00e0 une r\u00e9p\u00e9tition du paiement de $2,000, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour l\u2019appelante et \u00e0 son acquit (Buckley v. Brunette)[5], et \u00e0 une attaque contre la revente du 20 ao\u00fbt 1923, si cela devient n\u00e9cessaire, ainsi que contre les cons\u00e9quences de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que consentie par Dostie \u00e0 Vachon.\nElle n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9, il est vrai, dans la pr\u00e9sente action, l\u2019annulation de l\u2019acte du 20 ao\u00fbt 1923. Ce n\u2019est pas une raison pour lui refuser une d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9 de l\u2019acte du 24 janvier 1920, qui peut servir de base \u00e0 l\u2019annulation de l\u2019acte subs\u00e9quent.\nElle aurait pu r\u00e9unir ces demandes dans les conclusions d\u2019une seule action. Elle s\u2019est peut-\u00eatre expos\u00e9e par l\u00e0 \u00e0 se voir refuser les frais d\u2019une seconde action pour faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 l\u2019acte de revente, si jamais cette action est rendue n\u00e9cessaire. Elle ne saurait cependant \u00eatre priv\u00e9e de son droit de faire d\u00e9clarer la nullit\u00e9 de l\u2019acte originaire parce qu\u2019elle ne demande pas en m\u00eame temps une d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9 contre le second acte. L\u2019absence de conclusion \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard ne peut pas, en effet, \u00eatre tenu pour un acquiescement puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une nullit\u00e9 d\u2019ordre public que rien ne peut ratifier, ni confirmer.\nElle avait d\u2019ailleurs tent\u00e9, par les conclusions de sa d\u00e9claration, la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de la somme de $2,000 pay\u00e9e pour elle par Beaudoin. Si cette demande e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, elle e\u00fbt pu entra\u00eener l\u2019amendement requis pour faire annuler le contrat du 20 ao\u00fbt 1923 en vertu duquel cette somme de $2,000 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e. C\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pour cela que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a cru qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas opportun de statuer pr\u00e9sentement et dans cette instance sur les autres conclusions de l\u2019action.\nMais l\u2019on voit qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas rejet\u00e9 cette partie des conclusions; et il serait inexact de dire que l\u00e0-dessus 41 existe chose jug\u00e9e. Tous les droits de l\u2019appelante relativement aux obligations r\u00e9sultant de la revente de 1923 sont pr\u00e9serv\u00e9s et maintenus int\u00e9gralement par le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. D\u00e9clarer, comme l\u2019auraient voulu trois des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 l\u2019acte de vente originaire \u00e0 cause des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui sont survenus depuis et rejeter son action serait, au contraire, prononcer contre elle un jugement qui l\u2019emp\u00eacherait pour toujours de se faire relever des cons\u00e9quences de cet acte initial.\nA plus forte raison, doit-on reconna\u00eetre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019appelante et r\u00e9tablir en sa faveur le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance si l\u2019on consid\u00e8re le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi tel qu\u2019il est rendu et qui a maintenu l\u2019acte du 24 janvier 1920, comme l\u00e9gal et valide.\nPour ces raisons, nous faisons droit \u00e0 l\u2019appel quant \u00e0 Dostie, et cette partie du jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le contrat consenti le 24 janvier 1920 par l\u2019appelante \u00e0 Dostie est nul et sans effet est r\u00e9tabli et confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens dans toutes les cours contre l\u2019intim\u00e9 Dostie.\nEn ce qui concerne l\u2019intim\u00e9 Vachon, la situation est tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rente. Devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, Vachon avait simplement comparu comme mis-en-cause et n\u2019avait pas produit de plaidoyer. Le jugement d\u00e9clara son hypoth\u00e8que nulle et sans effet, sur le motif unique que Dostie, qui l\u2019avait consentie, n\u2019avait lui-m\u00eame aucun titre valable sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait pr\u00e9tendu hypoth\u00e9quer. Vachon se pourvut devant la Cour du Banc du Roi, qui infirma la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision purement et simplement et rejeta l\u2019action de l\u2019appelante. La raison donn\u00e9e dans la minute du jugement, en appel, est, comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, que la vente du 24 janvier 1920 \u00e9tait une v\u00e9ritable ali\u00e9nation qui ne venait pas \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la prohibition de l\u2019article 1301 du code civil. L\u2019hypoth\u00e8que de Vachon, sinon express\u00e9ment du moins implicitement, se trouva par l\u00e0 confirm\u00e9e et reconnue efficace. En d\u00e9clarant \u00e0 notre tour que le titre de Dostie \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gal et nul, nous ne croyons pas cependant devoir r\u00e9tablir quant \u00e0 Vachon le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance. Voici pourquoi:\nLe bref introductif de cette instance est en date du 26 mars 1925 et fut \u00e9mis dans le district de Beauce. A cette date, \u00e0 savoir depuis le 22 janvier 1925, les immeubles sur lesquels portait l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que de Vachon avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus par le sh\u00e9rif, dans une cause instruite dans le district de Sherbrooke.\nAu moment de l\u2019institution et de la signification de l\u2019action de l\u2019appelante, cette hypoth\u00e8que \u00e9tait \u00e9teinte par le d\u00e9cret forc\u00e9 (art. 2081 C.P.C., par. 6), qui avait purg\u00e9 tous les droits r\u00e9els (art. 781 C.P.C.). L\u2019appelante n\u2019avait donc plus aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 prendre des conclusions contre Vachon \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et \u00e0 demander, comme elle l\u2019a fait,\nque l\u2019enregistrement de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que consentie par le d\u00e9fendeur Dostie \u00e0 Philias Vachon soit aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul et de nul effet.\nCette hypoth\u00e8que ne comportait pour l\u2019appelante aucune obligation personnelle; seul son enregistrement pouvait affecter l\u2019appelante. Or cet enregistrement \u00e9tait disparu par l\u2019effet du d\u00e9cret. Il n\u2019y avait donc plus lieu d\u2019en demander la radiation. Il ne subsistait plus en faveur de Vachon qu\u2019un privil\u00e8ge sur les deniers provenant de la vente judiciaire et le droit d\u2019\u00eatre colloqu\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce privil\u00e8ge. Les deniers \u00e9taient alors entre les mains du sh\u00e9rif du district de Sherbrooke et c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0 que, de ce moment, il fallait aller engager toute contestation \u00e0 ce sujet.\nLe rapport de distribution de ces deniers a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sent dossier. Vachon n\u2019y est pas colloque. Cela d\u00e9montrerait davantage le d\u00e9faut d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019appelante sur ce point. Vachon admet cependant qu\u2019il conteste le rapport et il appert au dossier que cette contestation est encore pendante. L\u2019appelante, si elle le juge \u00e0 propos, n\u2019a qu\u2019\u00e0 y intervenir pour lier partie avec Vachon et l\u2019emp\u00eacher de toucher des deniers \u00e0 son pr\u00e9judice. Sur l\u2019appel de Vachon, nous partageons donc l\u2019avis de MM. les juges Allard, Tellier et Howard. Seulement, ce n\u2019est pas le motif sur lequel est fond\u00e9 le jugement de la cour qui, au contraire, a pour effet de maintenir la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019enregistrement de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que. L\u2019appelante, par l\u00e0, fut forc\u00e9e de se pourvoir devant la Cour Supr\u00eame contre les cons\u00e9quences de ce jugement, qui aurait autrement constitu\u00e9 chose jug\u00e9e et l\u2019aurait emp\u00each\u00e9e, au besoin, de faire valoir ses moyens sur la contestation du rapport de distribution \u00e0 Sherbrooke. Son appel devant cette cour \u00e9tait donc justifi\u00e9 et lui donne droit \u00e0 ses frais contre Vachon, qui est venu ici d\u00e9fendre le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi. Chaque partie cependant paiera ses frais, dans cette contestation, devant les autres cours. A la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, la cause quant \u00e0 Vachon s\u2019est instruite ex parte; et le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi a maintenu son appel, mais pour un motif que nous trouvons mal fond\u00e9.\nNous ferons donc droit \u00e0 l\u2019appel \u00e9galement sur la contestation avec Vachon et le jugement attaqu\u00e9 sera infirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens de l\u2019appel devant cette cour. Mais le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, dans ce cas, devra \u00eatre modifi\u00e9. La d\u00e9claration qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que de Vachon en sera retranch\u00e9e et il sera simplement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante n\u2019avait pas d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat dans la pr\u00e9sente action \u00e0 prendre ses conclusions sur ce point contre Vachon, tous ses droits sur la contestation du rapport de distribution \u00e0 Sherbrooke \u00e9tant sauvegard\u00e9s.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Rosaire Beaudoin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Morin & Vezina.\n[1] Q.R. 13 K.B. 281; [1904] A.C. 94.\n[2] (1887) 15 Can.

Lepage, [1927] S.C.R. 575\nDate: 1927-06-17\nCanadian National Railways Company (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nDame Albertine Lepage (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1927: May 25; 1927: June 17.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Newcombe, Rinfret and Lamont JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nRailways\u2014Negligence\u2014Station\u2014Waiting-room\u2014Door leading to cellar\u2014Unlocked and no sign\u2014Accident\u2014Person jailing down\u2014Liability of railway company.\u2014Art. 1053 C.C.\nA station owned by the appellant railway company contained a waiting-room inside of which were four doors: one leading to, or from, the platform on the track side; a second to the office of the station master from which tickets were sold; a third bearing on a metal sign \u201cWater closet,\u201d and a fourth, unmarked, situated at the rear, was giving access to a landing place at the head of the stairs leading to the cellar. At night, the waiting-room was well lighted while the landing and the staircase were dark. The respondent\u2019s husband, after sitting in the waiting-room for some time, was seen to get up, to walk towards the rear and to open the door leading to the cellar stair-case. He was heard to fall to the floor below and, being found lying unconscious, died the next evening from a fracture of the skull. The respondent took the present action in damages, alleging fault under art. 1053 C.C. consisting in the neglect of the railway company to indicate that ingress through that door was forbidden and in the omission of its employees to keep the door locked.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 43 K.B. 342), that the railway company was not liable. Besides the accommodation and facilities provided for its passengers in a station, a railway company can also have rooms and offices for the exclusive use of its employees, and the public cannot assume that access is allowed through all the doors opening into or leading out of a waiting-room. When the doors intended for public use are indicated, failure to put on the other doors notices that ingress through them is forbidden does not amount to negligence; on the contrary, the absence of any notice should put the public upon inquiry whether it should attempt to open these doors and to proceed further into a place where it has no business. But, even if the failure to keep the door locked would amount to legal negligence on appellant\u2019s part, the latter is still free from liability, as the cause of the accident was the deceased\u2019s own want of caution in proceeding beyond the door in the dark and in a strange place.\nKnight v. Grand Trunk Pacific Ry. Co. ([1926] S.C.R. 674) and Walker v. Midland Ry. Co. (55 L.T.R. 489) discussed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1] affirming the judgment of the Superior Court at Rimouski, D\u2019Auteuil J. and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action in damages for $11,413.80.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nC. V. Darveau K.C. and I. C. Rand K.C. for the appellant.\nL. St. Laurent K.C. and A. Taschereau for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014Some few minutes after nine o\u2019clock in the evening the respondent\u2019s husband, Alphonse Talbot, was in the waiting-room of the station owned by the appellant railway company, at Mont Joli. Although the train he intended to take was due only at 11.50 p.m., it is not disputed that Talbot stayed where he was with the acquiescence of the company.\nThe waiting-room had four doors: one leading to, or from, the platform on the track side; a second to the office of the station-master, from which, as usual, tickets were sold through the wicket; a third bore on a metal sign fastened to it the inscription in large yellow letters: \u201cWater Closet\u201d\u2014\u201cChambre de toilette\u201d; and the fourth, unmarked, was at the rear to the right hand of one entering the waiting-room from the station platform. This latter door opened inwards and gave access to a landing place at the head of the stairs leading to the cellar, which stairs descended at right angles to the doorway. In stepping on the landing, one found a blank wall in front of him; so that, in order to descend the steps, he had first to turn to his right and then go down. The top landing was thus encased on three sides by the walls of the building and the door, with a floor space of 3 feet 10 inches wide between the latter and the wall opposite and extending on the stair side (as the evidence shows) from one to two feet beyond the door. There was nothing unusual about these stairs. They were just ordinary stairs (comme un autre escalier). It was suggested that two employees had already fallen when descending, but no proof was made of the actual occurrences, far less of the surrounding circumstances, and no conclusions can be derived therefrom relevant to the present action.\nThe station-master tells us the use to which the cellar was put:\u2014\nIl y a la fournaise, du charbon, des affaires, du mat\u00e9riel pour les employ\u00e9s, les lampes, des chambres pour le supply \u00e9lectrique, diff\u00e9rentes choses, des batteries dans une autre chambre, une autre chambre pour le laveur, celui qui balaye, s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, et \u00e7a passe par cette porte-l\u00e0.\nQ. Est-ce qu\u2019il y avait beaucoup de circulation dans cet escalier-l\u00e0?\nR. Oui, passablement: 3 porteurs, 2 baggage-men, l\u2019homme des lampes, 2 baggage-men et l\u2019homme de la station, 4 trans-shippers qui prennent leurs quartiers l\u00e0, et quand on a besoin d\u2019eux autres, on va les chercher l\u00e0, ils ont soin de la fournaise.\nNone but employees of the company had any business in the cellar and it was common ground that the door leading to it was not intended to be used by the public. For the last three years it had: been the habit to leave it unlocked, and it was so on the night in question.\nTalbot had been sitting in the waiting-room for some time, on a seat facing the toilet-room, his travelling bag beside him. He was seen to get up (although he left his bag by the seat), to walk towards the rear, to open the door leading to the cellar stair-case and to pass through it. Then he was heard to fall to the floor below. Those who had been in the waiting-room at once went down to the cellar, where he was found lying unconscious. He died the following evening from a fracture of the skull caused by the fall.\nThe waiting-room was well lighted, while the landing and the stair-case were dark. All these facts are undisputed and liability admittedly depends exclusively upon the inference to be drawn from them.\nThe widow and the children brought action against the company. The only charge of negligence in the declaration was:\u2014\nLes employ\u00e9s de la d\u00e9fenderesse, par leur faute et leur n\u00e9gligence grossi\u00e8re, avaient omis de fermer cette porte \u00e0 clef.\nThe case was tried without a jury and the trial judge held that the door (which he found to be for the exclusive use of the employees) should have been locked, but had been left ajar, so that Talbot evidently believed and had reason to believe that this door was an exit or, at least, was intended to be used by the public. He thought the company had been negligent.\ndans le fait d\u2019avoir laiss\u00e9 cette porte ouverte sans indication que l\u2019usage en est interdit au public.\nThree of the judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench adopted the reasoning of the trial judge, while the two others, Dorion and Allard JJ., were of the contrary opinion and would have dismissed the action.\nThe respondent\u2019s case is rested on fault consisting not in any positive act or imprudence, but in the neglect of the company and its employees (art. 1053 C.C.). The fault ascribed to the employees is their omission to keep the door locked, and to the company, its failure to indicate that ingress through that door was forbidden.\nIt is a familiar principle that neglect may, in law, be considered a fault only if it corresponds with a duty to act. What, then, was the duty of the company towards the deceased?\nNo doubt, if the door had been locked, the accident would not have happened. Such, however, is not the test, and the duty must be made out upon legal grounds.\nRailway companies must maintain and operate stations and provide them with accommodation and facilities for their passengers; but these stations are their private property, and it is necessary and proper that the companies should operate them also for their own convenience and the carrying out of their work and duties. A waiting-room is, of course, one of the facilities expected in a railway station, and an intending passenger is entitled to the use of it. In some stations, but not by any means in all of them in the country districts, a toilet-room connecting with the waiting-room is also provided. This was the case at Mont Joli. Usually several doors open into or lead out of the waiting-room. The public may not assume that access is allowed through all these doors. The company must have rooms and offices for the exclusive use of its employees and the efficient conduct of its business. These rooms and offices may, and often must, open on to the waiting-room.\nWe know of no reason why the company should expect intending passengers to be likely to open these doors or why the passengers should believe that they are entitled to do so. Generally speaking, and in the absence of some sign or indication from the lay-out, a door leading out of a public room is in itself a warning that access beyond it may be restricted. Passengers at the Mont Joli station were shown by appropriate notices what doors were intended for their convenience and accommodation. The absence of any notice on the door in question should at least have put the deceased upon inquiry whether he should attempt to open it and (more particularly) to proceed further into a place where he had no business. The question for Talbot was not whether there was anything to indicate to him that he should not use the door and stair-way, but rather whether there was anything to indicate to him that he might do so. There may be peculiar circumstances where leaving a door ajar (\u201centr\u2019ouverte\u201d) is an invitation to enter. More often it is as indiscreet to open a door wider, when it is almost closed, as it would be, were it completely closed, to open it at all. Moreover, that, on the night in question, this particular door was ajar is not established. The only evidence upon the point is that of one Lebrun, who says:\u2014\nIl a ouvert la porte, elle avait un petit slack, elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas ferm\u00e9e \u00e0 net * * *\nQ. La porte \u00e9tait entre-baill\u00e9e?\nR. En tout cas, elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas barr\u00e9e certain, il l\u2019a ouverte.\nWe cannot, as a general principle, accept the proposition that, in the waiting-room of a railway station, where the doors intended for public use are indicated, failure to put on the other doors notices that ingress\u2019 through them is forbidden is negligence.\nIt was argued, however, that the duty of the appellant was to guard against any mistake which a man might naturally make. Evidence was offered that, to the knowledge of at least one of the employees of the company, there were instances where people had walked to the door and opened it, apparently in the mistaken belief that it led to the toilet-room. That is the strongest point made in support of the respondent\u2019s case and was, no doubt, the reason which induced the trial judge to hold\nque Talbot * * * avait raison de prendre cette porte comme une porte de sortie ou du moins une porte destin\u00e9e au public.\nThe argument is fortified by the fact that this was also the view taken by three judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench. The consequence, it is said, must follow that, in order to guard against this possible mistake, the company should have kept the door locked.\nA duty such as this could perhaps be cast upon the company if, beyond the door, a condition of unusual-danger was to be found, as, for example, a hole, a precipice, an open trap-door. But such things differ toto coelo from this staircase. The basis of a charge of negligence in omitting to lock the door is lacking. There was no duty owing to the deceased to keep it locked.\nCounsel have not brought to our attention any decision, under the law of Quebec or of France, applicable to this case. The general principle is laid down in Sourdat, De la Responsabilit\u00e9, 6e \u00e9d., vol. 1, no. 661. But the case bears a strong resemblance to Toomey v. London and Brighton Railway Co.[2], which, although decided under the English law, may be usefully cited as an illustration. On the platform of a railway station, there were two doors in close proximity to each other. One had painted over it the words: \u201cFor gentlemen\u201d and the other: \u201cLamp-room.\u201d The plaintiff, being unable to read, inquired from a stranger where he would find the urinal. Having received a direction, he by mistake opened the door to the lamp-room, fell down some steps and was injured. Upon action being brought, the ground taken was that the door should have been kept locked. The plaintiff was non-suited by the trial judge, who said that, in the absence of evidence that the place was more than ordinarily dangerous, no negligence could be found on the part of the company. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Common Pleas.\nBut, should we have regarded the failure to keep the door locked as something amounting to legal negligence in the premises, the respondent, in our view, would still fall short of proving that the unfortunate accident was due to this omission. The cause of the accident was Talbot\u2019s own want of caution in proceeding beyond the door in the dark and in a strange place. In the previous instances told about in the evidence, where strangers opened this door by mistake, they perceived the imprudence of advancing and they went no further. In the words of one of the witnesses:\u2014\nIls ouvraient la porte, il faisait noir et ils arr\u00eataient.\nWe have there a vivid illustration of what a careful and reasonable person would do under these circumstances and what Talbot should have done. Unfortunately, he chose to run the risk of going ahead in the dark and through his own carelessness in so doing he fell down the stairs.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal proceeds largely upon a discussion of the judgment of this court in Knight v. Grand Trunk Pacific Ry. Co.[3], and the case of Walker v. Midland Ry. Co.[4], which are the only cases referred to in the reasons of the judges.\nKnight v. G.T.P. Ry.3 was a case from the province of Alberta and, although the circumstances were somewhat different, many of the principles there laid down are familiar rules of the civil law applicable here.\nAs for Walker v. Midland Ry. Co.4, we are forcibly reminded of the words of the Earl of Selborne (with whom Lord Bramwell and Lord Watson concurred) in his speech before the House of Lords. They seem peculiarly apposite and no exception can be taken to them in a case which must be decided upon the law of Quebec. The facts were these: A guest in an inn, the property of the respondent company, left his bedroom in the middle of the night to go to a water-closet. There were properly lighted and easily accesible closets in the same corridor, but he went into a dark \u201cservice-room,\u201d the door of which was shut, but not locked, and fell down the unguarded well of a lift at the end of the room and was killed. The \u201cservice-room\u201d was not lighted or used at night and boarders had no business there at any time. In an action brought by the personal representatives of the deceased, the House of Lords, affirming the judgment of the court below, held that there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant company to go to a jury. After having stated the facts and pointed out the particular circumstances, Lord Selborne said:\u2014\nAt the most, these circumstances might explain his first act, in opening the door to see what (if anything) might be discernable within; but when he had done this, and found the room quite dark, I cannot regard either of them alone, or both together, as furnishing reasonable ground for his going forward in the dark to the place where he fell, instead of proceeding a little further along the corridor, where proper water-closets, with proper light, might have been found. Would the respondents have been wrong-doers towards him (all other circumstances being the same) if he had come to a steep staircase instead of the unguarded well of a lift, and had fallen down it? I think not.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed and the action dismissed. The appellant is entitled to its costs throughout if it elects to claim them.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C. V.

V, c. 8; (1922) 12-13 Geo. V, c. 47; (1923) 13-14 Geo. V, c. 70.\nThe transactions of a job printer, who contracts to deliver printed business cards, labels, order forms, price lists and statements, on material supplied by him, constitute sales by a producer within the meaning of the Special War Revenue Act (1918) and its amendments.\nWhether a job printer may or may not be styled a manufacturer or a producer according to the conception of these words in the commercial or ordinary sense, the intention of Parliament to include a job printer in the class of producers for the purposes of the sales tax is clearly indicated by the wording of the Act and its amendments.\nThe King v. Crain Printers Ltd. ([1925] 3 D.L.R. 291) approved.\nAPPEAL per saltum from the judgment of the Superior Court, at Montreal, province of Quebec, Duclos J., dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case are stated in the judgment now reported.\nA. Geoffrion K.C. and P. Lanctot K.C. for the appellant.\nE. Lafleur K.C. and Jacob De Witt K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The Minister of Customs and Excise claims from the Dominion Press Limited the sum of $3,684.20 for sales taxes from April, 1923, to October, 1924, under the provisions of the Special War Revenue Act, 1915, and amendments. The transactions took place in Montreal.\nIt was agreed, for the purposes of the present litigation, that the Minister was to be regarded as having the same right, to bring action as the King and that the judge should take judicial notice of the departmental circulars.\nIt was further agreed that the business of Dominion Press Limited, for the relevant period, exceeded $10,000 per annum.\nThe amount claimed is not disputed. Only the liability for the tax is in issue.\nThe first statute applicable in point of time is chapter 47 of 1922 (12-13 Geo. V.) which came into force on the 21st May, 1922. By section 13 of this statute, a new subsection 1 of s. 19BBB is enacted. The material part provides for the imposition of\nan excise tax of 2\u00bc per cent. on sales and deliveries by Canadian manufacturers or producers and wholesalers or jobbers * * * but in respect of sales by manufacturers or producers to retailers or consumers, the excise tax shall be 4\u00bc per cent * * *\nUnder the fourth paragraph of the subsection,\nthe taxes specified in this section shall not apply to sales or importations of * * * (then follows a long enumeration of articles, among which appears:) job printed matter produced and sold by printers or firms whose sales of job printing do not exceed $10,000 per annum.\nThen the subsequent paragraph reads:\nProvided further that the excise taxes specified in this section shall not be payable on goods exported, or on sales of goods made to the order of each individual customer by a business which sells exclusively by retail, under regulations by the Minister of Customs and Excise who shall be sole judge as to the classification of a business; and provided that the tax as specified in this section shall be payable on sales of goods manufactured for stock by merchants who sell exclusively by retail.\nOn the 1st January, 1924, came into force an amending statute and ss. 1 of s. 19BBB was then made to read:\n* * * there shall be imposed, levied and collected a consumption or sales tax of 6 per cent. on the sale price of all goods produced or manufactured in Canada * * * which tax shall be payable by the producer or manufacturer at the time of the sale thereof by him.\nThe new statute also struck out from the exemption in the fourth paragraph of ss. 1 the words above quoted:\nJob printed matter produced and sold by printers or firms whose sales of job printing do not exceed $10,000 per annum;\nbut the exemption was extended to all manufacturers or producers whose sales did not exceed $10,000 per annum.\nThe respondent pleads that it is\na contracting printer who prints by special contract to the order of each individual customer for whose purposes alone the work done is suitable and useful, and it in no sense manufactures or produces any merchandise for sale nor does it sell any goods inasmuch as the business carried on by it is one of lease and hire of work and service and not one of the sale of goods. The evidence is that Dominion Press Limited does \u201cgeneral job printing and lithographing * * * on special orders only.\u201d It makes \u201cno goods for stock.\u201d It does \u201cnothing but contract work.\u201d Its general way of doing business is described as follows by the manager of the defendant corporation:\nQ. And you generally supply the paper?\nA. That is a question. If it is a matter of supplying it from stock, we do not supply 1 per cent. A customer will come to us and ask us what is the most suitable paper for the job, and we tell him to the best of our knowledge. Almost invariably he will ask us to get it for him, because we know something about the quality and will see there is nothing put over. He will pay us precisely the same price for the paper as if he went to the jobbing house, but the jobbing house in consideration of saving a salesman going around allows us a commission of 20 per cent.\nQ. On the paper?\nA. Yes, for securing them that customer. They understand they are supplying the customer with the paper, but as part consideration for the 20 per cent. we collect the amount for them with our bill for the labour.\nQ. You are liable for the price towards the manufacturer?\nA. Yes.\nQ. A customer comes to you and says: \u201cI want some letter-heads, or envelopes (as for example) printed for me on this certain paper\u201d and as you have not that paper in stock you go to the paper dealer and buy the paper. Do you mention to the dealer the name of the person for whom you are buying the paper?\nA. Not necessarily.\nQ. Is the paper invoiced to him?\nA. No. It is invoiced to the printer. That is part of the consideration.\nQ. So far as the paper seller knows, it is simply a matter of your going to him and getting the paper, which is invoiced to you, and paid by you?\nA. That is true.\nQ. You get the paper, print it, and deliver the printed product to the particular customer who has ordered it?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And he pays you for the paper and printing combined, but you do not charge him more for the paper than if he had bought it directly? Your profit on the paper is the lesser price\u2014call it commission, or what you will\u2014that the paper maker has allowed you on the invoice?\nA. Yes. Of course, that is not every transaction.\nQ. But, that is a typical transaction?\nA. No. A customer may want us to print some government postcards for him. He does not go to the trouble of getting the cards and we go to the post office and get them, and include the amount in his bill. We are not competing with the post office. In the same way, a man may be getting out a prospectus, and will ask us if we will distribute this prospectus for him, and mail it to his customers. We sometimes have a bill for $50 or $75 or $100 for postage. We simply get the postage stamps. We call these things disbursements. Our costs are invariably computed on the labour alone, those other things we regard as outside.\nQ. But, the profit on those things enters into your receipts?\nA. The commission we get for that service helps pay our expenses.\nQ. Leaving aside exceptional cases, the general way of doing business is the one you have just described?\nA. Yes.\nOn this evidence, the contract between the respondent and its customers is not one of lease and hire, but one of sale. It is a contract for the sale of a thing to be made (\u201cchose \u00e0 faire\u201d or \u201cchose une fois faite\u201d).\nSuch is the solution of the Roman law and of the old French law which the Commissioners have embodied in the Civil Code of Quebec. On this subject, a quotation from Pothier (Bugnet, 3rd edition, vol. 4, no. 394) is strictly in point:\nCe contrat (de louage d\u2019ouvrage) a aussi beaucoup d\u2019analogie avec le contrat de vente.\nJustinien en ses Institutes, au tit\u2014de Loc. cond., dit qu\u2019on doute \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de certains contrats, s\u2019ils sont contrats de vente ou contrats de louage, et il donne cette r\u00e8gle pour les discerner: \u201clorsque c\u2019est l\u2019ouvrier qui fournit la mati\u00e8re, c\u2019est un contrat de vente; au contraire, lorsque c\u2019est moi qui fournis \u00e0 l\u2019ouvrier la mati\u00e8re de l\u2019ouvrage que je lui fais faire, le contrat est un contrat de louage.\u201d\nPar exemple, si j\u2019ai fait march\u00e9 avec un orf\u00e8vre pour qu\u2019il me fasse une paire de flambeaux d\u2019argent, et qu\u2019il fournisse la mati\u00e8re, c\u2019est un contrat de vente que cet orf\u00e8vre me fait de la paire de flambeaux qu\u2019il se charge de faire; mais si je lui ai fourni un lingot d\u2019argent pour qu\u2019il m\u2019en f\u00eet une paire de flambeaux, c\u2019est un contrat de louage.\nObservez que, pour qu\u2019un contrat soit un contrat de louage, il suffit que je fournisse \u00e0 l\u2019ouvrier la principale mati\u00e8re qui doit entrer clans la composition de l\u2019ouvrage; quoique l\u2019ouvrier fournisse le surplus, le contrat n\u2019en est pas moins un contrat de louage.\nOn peut apporter plusieurs exemples de ce principe.\nLorsque j\u2019envoie chez mon tailleur de l\u2019\u00e9toffe pour me (faire un habit: quoique le tailleur, outre sa fa\u00e7on, fournisse les boutons, le fil, m\u00eame les doublures et les galons, notre march\u00e9 n\u2019en sera pas moins un contrat de louage, parce que l\u2019\u00e9toffe que je fournis est ce qu\u2019il y a de principal dans un habit.\nPareillement, le march\u00e9 que j\u2019ai fait avec un entrepreneur pour qu\u2019il me construise une maison, ne laisse pas d\u2019\u00eatre un contrat de louage, quoique par notre march\u00e9 il doive fournir les mat\u00e9riaux, parce que le terrain que je fournis pour y construire la maison, est ce qu\u2019il y a de principal dans une maison, quum dedificium solo cedat.\nThe modem doctrine and jurisprudence in France should perhaps be accepted with caution, because article 1711 of the Code Napol\u00e9on contains the following definition:\nLes devis, march\u00e9s, ou prix faits pour l\u2019entreprise d\u2019un ouvrage moyennant un prix d\u00e9termin\u00e9 sont aussi un louage lorsque la mati\u00e8re est fournie par celui pour qui l\u2019ouvrage se fait; which is not to be found in the Civil Code of Quebec. But the preponderating opinion is that the above passage of Pothier well expresses the state of the old law (Fuzier-Herman, R\u00e9pertoire, verbo Louage d\u2019ouvrage, de services et d\u2019industrie. no. 1105). Planiol (Droit Civil, 6th ed. vol. 2, no. 1902) calls it the \u201csolution traditionnelle\u201d. On the authority of Clay v. Yates[1] the situation would be the same under the common law.\nAccording to the evidence before us, the respondent does not undertake to print on material (such as tags, cards, or paper generally) supplied by the client. It contracts to sell and deliver printed business cards, labels, order forms, price lists, statements and general stationery. The transactions described in the evidence and in respect of which the Minister seeks to recover taxes are sales. In the words of Pothier, \u201celles participent du contrat de vente.\u201d\nWe must decide moreover that they are sales by a producer within the meaning of the statute. For the question is not whether a job printer may or may not be styled a manufacturer or a producer, according to the conception of these words in the commercial or even in the ordinary sense. What we have to enquire is whether it was the intention of Parliament, for the purposes of the sales tax, to include a job printer in the class of producers. This intention, we think, is clearly indicated by the exclusion of:\njob printed matter produced and sold by printers or firms whose sales of job printing do not exceed $10,000 per annum\nfrom the imposition of the sales tax. The use of the word \u201cproduced\u201d shows that, in the mind of the legislator, job printing done in pursuance of a contract of sale (such as the evidence shows the respondent to have done here) was the work of a \u201cproducer.\u201d This view is also supported by the fact that, if such had not been the intention of the legislator, there would have been no necessity for the special exemption of\njob printed matter * * * sold by printers or firms whose sales * * * do not exceed $10,000 per annum.\nWe agree with the appellant that the repeal of this exception the following year cannot alter its effect upon the meaning of the general words, especially as the repeal was mainly for the purpose of extending the exemption to all manufacturers and producers.\nWe now have to consider the proviso\nthat the excise taxes specified in this section shall not be payable on sales of goods made to the order of each individual customer by a business which sells exclusively by retail, under regulations by the Minister of Customs and Excise who shall be sole judge as to the classification of a business; and provided that the tax as specified in this section shall be payable on sales of goods manufactured for stock by merchants who sell exclusively by retail.\nThere is no doubt that the sales in respect of which taxes are claimed by the Minister in this action were, according to the evidence before us,\nsales of goods made to the order of each individual customer by a business which sells exclusively by retail.\nWe find moreover that, on the 18th August, 1921, the Minister of Customs adopted the following regulation:\nJob printers, or newspaper publishers who also do job printing, may be classed as retailers when selling exclusively, by retail, goods made to the order of each individual customer.\nGoods made for stock, or sold to customers for resale, are held to be subject to the sales tax.\nConcerns covered by the first paragraph will not be required to secure sales tax licenses, nor collect sales tax.\nThis ruling in effect from the 10th May, 1921, inclusive.\nThis was a classification of the business of the respondent, pursuant to the proviso of the statute. As a result, sales of the character of those made by the respondent became exempt from excise taxes, while the regulation remained in force. Upon this point, we are in accord with the views expressed by Rose J. in The King v. Grain Printers Limited[2]. This judgment went to the Appellate Division, but the appeal was dismissed by default.\nBut, on the 13th July, 1922, the Minister of Customs and Excise, issued another regulation reading as follows:\nOttawa, 13th July, 1922.\nUnder authority of the provision of section 19BBB, of the 1922 amendment to the Special War Revenue Act, the following businesses are hereby classified as manufacturers, subject to the payment of sales tax on their sales:\u2014\nJob printers whose sales of printed matter are ten thousand dollars per annum or more;\nManufacturers of loose-leaf systems or devices;\nPipe organ builders;\nBoat builders. Except perhaps in its attempt to define job printers as manufacturers\u201d\u2014which was quite unnecessary and ineffective\u2014this regulation does not do more than repeat, in different words, the enactment of the statute that\nthe taxes * * * shall not apply to sales * * * of * * * job printed matter produced and sold by printers or firms whose sales of job printing do not exceed $10,000 per annum.\nIn terms, it restores the liability to the payment of the sales tax already imposed by the statute upon all job printers whose sales of printed matter are $10,000 or more, and, in effect, it does away with the exemption in favour of\njob printers * * * when selling exclusively, by retail, goods made to the order of each individual customer\n\u2014resulting from the regulation of the 18th August, 1921. The latter must therefore be held to have been superseded by the regulation of the 13th July, 1922. We know of no subsequent regulation and none was invoked by the respondent. It follows that during the period extending from April, 1923, to October, 1924, in respect of which the arrears of sales taxes are claimed to be due by the respondent, no exemption was in force in favour of job printers who sold\nexclusively by retail * * * goods made to the order of each individual customer,\non account of the absence of the regulation necessary to give effect to the exemption and without which the proviso could not apply.\nIt may further be said that, after the 1st January, 1924, when section 6 of c. 70 of the statute of 1923 came into force, no regulation of the kind could have been issued, because the proviso was then repealed and the power of classification by the Minister was taken away by Parliament.\nFor these reasons, we think the appeal should be allowed, and the action maintained, with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Marcotte & Lanctot.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Jacob De Witt.\n[1] 1 H. & N. 73; 156 E.R. 1123.\n[2] [1925] D.L.R. 291.\n",

C., having had previous dealings with P., was looked for as a prospective buyer and he finally authorized P. as his agent to make an offer for the property at the price asked for, but comprising, instead of cash, mortgages and real estate (estimated at $35,000. This offer was refused by D. who, at the same time, advised P. that he would reduce the purchase price to $160,000, the cash payment being then $20,000. The refusal of D. and the change in the conditions of sale were not made known to C; but, later on, S., the president of the company, undertook to accept for himself both the offer of C. to buy and the second offer of D. to sell. C. subsequently refused to purchase on the terms of his offer, and S., having sold the property for $160,000, sued C. for $15,000 as damages or loss of profits.\nHeld, that P., having assumed the mandate of buying the property for the benefit of C., could not accept for itself the second offer of D. without notifying C. of the new conditions of sale and could not have any claim against C. for loss of profit; and that s., as president of the company, was by law bound to act for it in the performance of its mandate towards C. and could not therefore have more rights than the company itself.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, at Montreal, and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and more fully in the judgment now reported.\nEug.

The judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014Une dame Maria Gori, veuve r\u00e9sidant en Italie, \u00e9tait en 1924 propri\u00e9taire de deux conciergeries situ\u00e9es \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et connues sous les noms de Marlowe Apartment et King Emmanuel Apartment. John Dominique \u00e9tait son fond\u00e9 de pouvoirs.\nDans le cours du mois d\u2019octobre, Dominique avait confi\u00e9 \u00e0 The Prudential Realty & Investment Company, Limited, agence d\u2019immeubles, la vente de ces conciergeries. Il en demandait $175,000, comprenant les hypoth\u00e8ques au montant de $140,000, que l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur aurait \u00e0 assumer, et $35,000 en argent, dont il exigeait que $20,000 \u00e0 $25,000 fussent pay\u00e9s comptant. Conrad Comtois, l\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00e9tait depuis plusieurs mois en relations d\u2019affaires avec The Prudential Company. Il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 utilis\u00e9 ses services pour tenter l\u2019acquisition d\u2019autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s. Il poss\u00e9dait des logements de rapport et des cr\u00e9ances hypoth\u00e9caires. Il offrit, par l\u2019entremise de cette agence d\u2019immeubles, d\u2019acheter les conciergeries Marlowe et King Emmanuel pour le prix de $175,000, en prenant charges des hypoth\u00e8ques, mais en effectuant le paiement de la balance par le transport de ses cr\u00e9ances hypoth\u00e9caires, mentionn\u00e9es en d\u00e9tail, et par la dation ou \u00e9change de ses logements de rapport.\nCette proposition fut soumise \u00e0 Dominique qui la refusa; mais qui, en m\u00eame temps, autorisa The Prudential Company \u00e0 vendre pour la somme de $160,000, form\u00e9e toujours des hypoth\u00e8ques et d\u2019un montant de $20,000 comptant. La compagnie omit d\u2019informer Comtois \u00e0 la fois du refus et de la contre-proposition de Dominique. Au lieu de cela, elle fit accepter par M. Guy Smith, l\u2019appelant, les offres respectives d\u2019achat et de vente qu\u2019elle d\u00e9tenait entre ses mains de la part de Comtois et de Dominique. Smith \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9sident de The Prudential Realty and Investment Company, Limited. Les autres directeurs \u00e9taient ses deux fils; et Grimaldi, le g\u00e9rant, \u00e9tait son gendre.\nL\u2019acceptation par Smith de l\u2019offre de Dominique pr\u00eate fortement au soup\u00e7on de simulation, car il fut prouv\u00e9 que Smith n\u2019a pas fait le paiement de $20,000 port\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019acte de vente qui s\u2019ensuivit, et qu\u2019il se fit remettre une contre-lettre par laquelle Dominique s\u2019engageait \u00e0 reprendre les deux conciergeries si Comtois ne donnait pas suite \u00e0 sa proposition d\u2019achat. C\u2019est ce qui arriva. Comtois refusa de conclure avec Smith. Ce dernier r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 trouver un autre acqu\u00e9reur pour le prix que Dominique consentait \u00e0 accepter; et il r\u00e9clame maintenant, \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, la somme de $15,000 pour le pr\u00e9tendu b\u00e9n\u00e9fice qu\u2019il aurait r\u00e9alis\u00e9 si Comtois avait achet\u00e9 au prix qu\u2019il avait offert. Il r\u00e9clame, en outre, les frais incidents.\nIl est loin d\u2019\u00eatre certain que le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Smith e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 vraiment de $15,000. Les deux propositions n\u2019\u00e9taient pas semblables. Celle de Dominique exigeait $20,000 comptant. En vertu de l\u2019offre de Comtois, aucune partie du prix n\u2019\u00e9tait payable en argent. En outre des hypoth\u00e8ques qui affectaient les conciergeries, ce prix \u00e9tait form\u00e9 de cr\u00e9ances hypoth\u00e9caires avec \u00e9ch\u00e9ances r\u00e9parties sur plusieurs ann\u00e9es et dont le capital, pour deux d\u2019entre elles, \u00e9tait remboursable par versements annuels ou semi-annuels. De plus, les logements de rapport et les autres immeubles offerts en \u00e9change \u00e9taient port\u00e9s dans l\u2019offre \u00e0 une valeur fix\u00e9e par Comtois lui-m\u00eame et que nul, au cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, ne s\u2019est charg\u00e9 d\u2019appr\u00e9cier.\nEn somme, les parties se sont born\u00e9es \u00e0 discuter la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 en dommages. Elles ne se sont pas pr\u00e9occup\u00e9es de la preuve de ces dommages. Aucune d\u2019elles n\u2019a song\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la valeur respective des offres. Il e\u00fbt peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 difficile de trouver dans le dossier les donn\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires pour fixer d\u2019une fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9cise la somme du profit que Smith a r\u00e9ellement perdu. Ce profit ne s\u2019\u00e9tablit pas n\u00e9cessairement par la diff\u00e9rence entre les chiffres mentionn\u00e9s dans les deux propositions.\nMais la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9termin\u00e9 de quelle mani\u00e8re il e\u00fbt fallu proc\u00e9der \u00e0 ce calcul, parce qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que, dans les circonstances, l\u2019appelant ne pouvait \u00eatre admis \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer de l\u2019intim\u00e9 des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. En fait, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a jug\u00e9 que Comtois avait constitu\u00e9 The Prudential Company sa mandataire pour acheter les deux conciergeries. Nous ne saurions d\u00e9cider que, en cela, elle n\u2019a pas fait une juste appr\u00e9ciation des circonstances prouv\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate et des termes de l\u2019offre du 11 novembre 1924.\nSans doute, la compagnie \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 la mandataire de Madame Gori, par d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de Dominique; mais le courtier peut quelquefois \u00eatre le mandataire des deux parties (art. 1735 CC). A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, nous ne nous demandons pas si The Prudential Company aurait d\u00fb refuser le mandat de Comtois parce qu\u2019il pouvait entrer en conflit avec celui de Dominique. Nous ne discutons, pour le moment, qu\u2019une question de fait. La compagnie a effectivement accept\u00e9 de se charger d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir les conciergeries pour le compte de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Il lui incombait, d\u00e8s lors, d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter son mandat de la meilleure mani\u00e8re possible (Lamarre v. Clairmont[1]; Aubut v. Gareau[2]), en toute diligence et loyaut\u00e9, et suivant la plus enti\u00e8re bonne foi. C\u2019est en pr\u00e9sentant l\u2019offre de Comtois \u00e0 Dominique que, \u00e0 la suite du refus de ce dernier, le g\u00e9rant de The Prudential Company re\u00e7ut la contre-proposition qui a donn\u00e9 lieu au litige.\nL\u2019appelant ne saurait pr\u00e9tendre que cette contre-proposition n\u2019\u00e9tait\u2019 pas avantageuse, puisqu\u2019il all\u00e8gue qu\u2019elle repr\u00e9sente pour lui un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de $15,000. Il \u00e9tait donc du devoir de The Prudential Realty and Investment Company, charg\u00e9e par Comtois d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir les conciergeries et qui avait accept\u00e9 ce mandat, de communiquer \u00e0 Comtois le refus de Dominique, ainsi que les conditions nouvelles auxquelles ce dernier \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 se soumettre. Au lieu d\u2019en agir ainsi, The Prudential Company a offert \u00e0 Smith les avantages qui pouvaient r\u00e9sulter de la nouvelle offre de Dominique. Elle a ainsi failli \u00e0 ses obligations envers son mandant. Il parait clair qu\u2019il ne saurait en r\u00e9sulter en sa faveur le droit de r\u00e9clamer de ce dernier, sous forme de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice que, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il lui incombait de mettre \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de ce mandant.\nMais, dans le cas actuel, la mandataire est une compagnie incorpor\u00e9e. Elle ne peut agir que par l\u2019entremise de ses officiers. Le devoir envers Comtois devait ici \u00eatre rempli par les officiers de la compagnie. Smith, son pr\u00e9sident, occupait vis-\u00e0-vis de Comtois la position de celui qui avait accept\u00e9, au nom de la compagnie, d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter le mandat qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re. Il serait inadmissible qu\u2019il p\u00fbt, dans les circonstances, avoir contre Comtois une r\u00e9clamation en dommages qui serait ni\u00e9e \u00e0 la compagnie elle-m\u00eame.\nCela nous am\u00e8ne au second argument qui milite contre l\u2019action de l\u2019appelant. Les mandataires ne peuvent se rendre acqu\u00e9reurs, ni par eux-m\u00eames, ni par parties interpos\u00e9es, des biens qu\u2019ils sont charg\u00e9s de vendre (art. 1484 C.C.). Ce principe, qui est general pour les administrateurs au sujet des biens qui leur sont confi\u00e9s, a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tendu encore dans le cas du mandat; et la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e9nonce une r\u00e8gle, tir\u00e9e de la loi romaine, qui ne se trouve pas dans le Code Napol\u00e9on en d\u00e9fendant \u00e0 un \u201cagent employ\u00e9 pour acheter ou vendre quelque chose\u201d d\u2019en \u00eatre \u201cl\u2019acheteur ou le vendeur pour son compte\u201d (art. 1706 C.C.).\nIl s\u2019ensuit que The Prudential Realty & Investment Co. Ltd. n\u2019aurait pu, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, accepter pour elle-m\u00eame, sans en avoir pleinement inform\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019offre que Dominique lui remit le 11 novembre 1924, parce qu\u2019elle avait assum\u00e9 le mandat d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s pour Comtois.\nSi The Prudential Company ne pouvait ainsi devenir l\u2019acheteur, elle n\u2019aurait pu \u00e9videmment r\u00e9clamer de l\u2019intim\u00e9 les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices qu\u2019elle aurait realis\u00e9s au moyen d\u2019un pareil achat. Le motif de cette prohibition est notoire:\nL\u2019on n\u2019a pas voulu mettre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel aux prises avec le devoir, sans doute parce qu\u2019on a craint que dans ce conflit le devoir ne f\u00fbt sacrifi\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat (24 Laurent, n\u00b0 53).\nOr, comme nous venons de le dire, une compagnie ne fait rien par elle-m\u00eame. Le devoir de la compagnie est rempli par ses officiers. Dans le cas actuel, Smith, pr\u00e9sident de The Prudential Company, \u00e9tait personnellement au courant du mandat que sa compagnie d\u00e9tenait de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Il en connaissait tous les d\u00e9tails puisqu\u2019il a mis sa signature au bas de l\u2019offre de Comtois. Cette obligation de diligence, de loyaut\u00e9 et de bonne foi que doit tout mandataire \u00e0 son mandant, c\u2019est Smith, comme pr\u00e9sident, de concert avec le g\u00e9rant et les autres officiers, qui devait n\u00e9cessairement l\u2019accomplir.\nIl \u00e9tait donc v\u00e9ritablement l\u2019un de ceux qui devaient ex\u00e9cuter le mandat. Comme cons\u00e9quence, le principe fondamental de moralit\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9 par les articles 1484 et 1706 du code civil s\u2019\u00e9tendait \u00e0 lui et aux relations qu\u2019il pouvait avoir avec Comtois. On doit assimiler sa situation \u00e0 celle de l\u2019inspecteur dans un cas de cession de biens, \u00e0 qui cette cour a ni\u00e9 le droit d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir pour son propre compte l\u2019actif du d\u00e9biteur insolvable, pour la raison que no one having duties of a fiduciary character to discharge should be allowed to put his duties in conflict with his interest (Castonguay v. Savoie (1).\nSmith ne peut donc \u00eatre accueilli dans sa demande de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats repr\u00e9sentant la perte d\u2019un pr\u00e9tendu b\u00e9n\u00e9fice acquis en contravention de ce principe.\nC\u2019est pourquoi nous sommes d\u2019avis de confirmer avec d\u00e9pens les jugements qui ont d\u00e9bout\u00e9 l\u2019appelant de son action.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Beauregard & Labelle.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lamothe, Gadbois & Charbonneau.\n[1] (1915) Q.R. 48 S.C. 461.\n[2] (1918) Q.R. 27 K.B. 474.\n",

The judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, 22 Alta. L.R. 360, was reversed, the Court holding, on construction' of the agreement in question, that the defendant insurance company had the right to terminate, as it did, the plaintiff's agency under the agreement, and that the plaintiff was not entitled to commission on renewal premiums paid after such termination.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1] which, by a majority, allowed the plaintiff's appeal from the judgment of Boyle J., and ordered a new trial.\nAmong other claims between the parties were claims by the plaintiff for damages for wrongful dismissal and for other breaches of contract, and a claim for commissions in respect of renewal insurance premiums. Boyle J., who withdrew the case from the jury, held against the plaintiff on the said specified claims.\nBy agreement dated 1st October, 1922, the plaintiff agreed to act as the defendant's district manager during the continuance of the agreement, and the defendant agreed \"that while the [plaintiff] is acting for the [defendant] as such agent as aforesaid, and complying with the terms and conditions herein, on his part, which said terms and conditions are hereby made a condition precedent, he will be paid the following remuneration for his services.\" Then followed the provisions for commissions to be paid, including an item \"Renewals participating 5 per cent.; Renewals, non-participating 2\u00bd per cent.\" The agreement contained the following clause: \"This agreement may be terminated at any time by [the defendant] giving [the plaintiff] notice in writing, terminating same, and [the plaintiff] agrees with [the defendant] forthwith, after receiving said notice, to render an account of and pay [the defendant] all moneys, and deliver up all notes, securities, papers and supplies held by him * * *.\"\nBy letter dated 14th June, 1924, written from Toronto, Ontario, by the defendant's general manager of agencies to the plaintiff at Red Deer, Alberta, the defendant notified the plaintiff of termination of the agreement.\nBoyle J. held that, under the terms of the agreement, the defendant was at liberty to terminate the agreement without giving any reasons; that the plaintiff was entitled to credit for all commissions, renewal commissions and bonus on all insurance premiums falling due and paid by either cash or note to and including the 14th June, 1924, but refused to hold that the plaintiff was entitled to commissions on renewal premiums paid after that date.\nIn the Appellate Division [2] the majority of the Court (Harvey C.J., Beck and Mitchell JJA.) held that, in construing the agreement, the words \"while the [plaintiff] is acting for the [defendant] as such agent\" should not be taken as attached to the word \"paid,\" but to the word \"services,\" the sense thus being that the plaintiff was to be paid for his services performed while he was agent; hence, if there were no services which the agent was bound to perform with regard to the renewal of insurance policies, his services in procuring the insurance originally were the services which entitled him to the agreed commission on the renewal premiums, and, in such case, it was a reasonable construction to say that the meaning was that the agent would be entitled to commission on renewal premiums when paid and so long as they continued to be paid; that, in this regard, there were questions of fact which the plaintiff was entitled to have submitted to the jury, and there should be a new trial. Hyndman and Clarke JJA., dissenting, held, on construction of the agreement, that the plaintiff was not entitled to commission on renewal premiums payable after the termination of his agency, but, making allowance for time for the letter terminating the agency to reach the plaintiff, they would fix the 20th June, rather than the 14th June, 1924, as the date of termination of the agency.\nFrom the judgment of the Appellate Division the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the appellant.\nE. Lafleur K.C. and W. E. Payne K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The plaintiff's rights are governed by the terms of his contract of employment and we are, with respect, unable to find in those terms anything uncertain or equivocal. Termination of the contract at any time by notice is expressly made optional with the Association. Whether there existed good ground for the termination is quite irrelevant. On such notice being duly given, the plaintiff's services forthwith came to an end. He was thereupon made accountable to the Association for all \"monies, documents,\" etc., in his hands relating to its business and he thereafter ceased to act for the Association.\nHis right to recover \"remuneration for his services,\" i.e., commissions on new insurance and renewal premiums, is likewise expressly restricted by the words,\nwhile he is acting for the said Association as such Agent as aforesaid, and complying with the terms and conditions herein, on his part, which said terms and conditions are hereby made a condition precedent.\nThere is nothing ambiguous in this contract. Its plain terms must be given effect to regardless of any consideration of harshness or unfairness or of supposed intentions of the parties other than those expressed therein. With the learned trial judge (Boyle, J.) and Hyndman and Clarke, JJ.A., we are of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to commissions only in respect of premiums paid, whether in cash or notes, prior to his discharge. We would, however, for the reasons indicated by Clarke, J.A., fix the date of discharge at the 20th of June, 1924, rather than the 14th of June, 1924.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Appellate Division and, with the slight modification suggested, the judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 2 Alta. L.R. 360 1 [1926] 3 W.W.R. 670.\n[2] 22 Alta. L.R. 360; [1926] 3 W.W.R. 670\n",

Gowrie [1910] A.C. 614); and he is entitled to his commission, although the price paid by the purchaser is less than the sum at first demanded by the principal.\nEven when actions in simple warranty are joined to the principal action for purposes of hearing and of judgment, they remain distinct from it and are not merged by the joinder; if the defendant in sub-warranty, who intervened in the principal action, alone appeals from a judgment maintaining the principal action and the actions in warranty, confining his appeal to his intervention, this judgment becomes res judicata as to the principal defendant and the plaintiffs in warranty and sub-warranty, and the judgment of the appellate court, reversing it as to the parties who did not appeal, is ultra vires and quasi nonexistent as to them.\nUpon an appeal to this court between the same parties who were before the appellate court, although the principal defendant and the plaintiffs in warranty and in sub-warranty were not made parties to it, the whole judgment appealed from is open for discussion and disposal; and this court can deal with that decision as irregular and ultra vires and give the judgment which should have been given by the appellate court, so as to leave its full effect to the judgment of the trial court, thus reversed illegally and without right. (Supreme Court Act, s. 51.)\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, at Montreal, Lane J. and dismissing the principal action and the action in warranty and sub-warranty.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the judgment now reported.\nG. H. Montgomery K.C. and E. Gate for the appellant.\nA. Wainwright K.C. for the respondent.\nN. A. Belcourt K.C. for the Bank of Nova Scotia.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The Bank of Nova Scotia, being the owner of a certain immovable property on St. James street, Montreal, agreed, if the sale of that property were effected by the appellant The Montreal Agencies Limited, to pay it a commission of 2\u00bd per cent. on the sale price. The bank fixed that price at $300,000.\nThe respondent, L. E. Kimpton, approached the Montreal Agencies and intimated that he had a prospective purchaser. The company promised that, in the event of his being able to bring this sale to a successful issue, it would divide its commission of 2\u00bd per cent. equally with him. Whereupon Kimpton disclosed the intended purchaser as being The L. E. Waterman Company Limited, and submitted the latter\u2019s offer to the Montreal Agencies, which in turn placed it before the bank. The offer however was only for $250,000, partly cash and partly in deferred payments and, for the moment at least, did not prove acceptable to the bank. The parties went on negotiating through the Montreal Agencies, to which the bank wrote, on the 25th September, 1916:\u2014\nIn any event, if you will keep us advised of how the matter goes, we will do everything possible to strengthen your hands.\nOn October 4, Kimpton notified the Montreal Agencies that the Waterman company had withdrawn its offer \u201con account of it not being acceptable to you\u201d and that the negotiations in connection with the same should be considered cancelled.\nThis was not, in fact, true. Lane J., who tried the case, found\u2014and we agree with him\u2014that Kimpton wrote this letter to the Agencies company in bad faith, for the purpose of carrying the deal through on his own account and of securing for himself the whole instead of one-half only of the commission. He sought, at the trial, to explain that Kissock, the assistant manager of the Montreal Agencies, had deceived him by falsely telling; him that his company held an exclusive right of sale. This was denied by Kissock; no such reason was assigned by Kimpton in his letter of the 4th October and the trial judge disbelieved his story.\nIn reality, the offer of the Waterman company to the bank was never withdrawn. The very next day after his notification to the Montreal Agencies, Kimpton wrote to the bank about the matter. Although without the participation of the Montreal Agencies, the negotiations continued and their outcome was an agreement of sale between the bank and the Waterman company signed on the 7th March, 1917, for $250,000 cash.\nOn this state of facte, Lane J. held the Montreal Agencies entitled to its commission from the bank and we think rightly so. No doubt the Waterman company was originally Kimpton\u2019s client. But Kimpton agreed that it should be introduced to the bank by the Montreal Agencies. That he, Kimpton, would \u201cbring this sale to a successful issue\u201d and that, in consideration for same, he would expect his remuneration not from the bank but from the Montreal Agencies, was precisely the bargain he made on the 19th May, 1916. So far as the bank was concerned, the appellant found the purchaser and brought the parties together as buyer and seller. This was done not only with the full consent of Kimpton, but as part of the agreement which he had made with the Montreal Agencies.\nAgainst the bank, therefore, that company is entitled to the commission. The agent who brings his principal into relation with the actual purchaser is the effective cause of the sale, although the principal sells \u201cbehind the back of the agent and unknown to him.\u201d (Burchell v. Gowrie[1]). The commission is due even if the price paid be less than the sum at first demanded by the principal, especially if the price finally accepted by him is that which he had originally refused, when the buyer was introduced by the agent. It would not lie within the power of the principal, by his initial refusal, thus to prevent the agent from receiving his commission (Art. 1084 C.C.).\nIn the deed of sale, the Waterman company assumed payment of all commissions. Both the company and F. D. Waterman personally undertook to indemnify the bank against any such charges, if asserted. The Waterman company obtained from Kimpton a guarantee against the payment of any remuneration other than to him.\nUpon learning of the sale, the Montreal Agencies claimed its commission and, the bank having refused to pay it, the present action was brought. The bank called Waterman and the Waterman company in warranty and they, in turn, called Kimpton in sub-warranty. No plea was fyled by the bank, sole defendant in the principal action; nor did Waterman and the Waterman company contest the action in warranty. But Kimpton intervened under Art. 186 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which reads as follows:\u2014\n186.\u2014In cases of simple or personal warranty, the warrantor cannot take up the defence of the defendant, but can merely intervene and contest the principal demand, if he thinks proper.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court dismissed the intervention and maintained the principal action together with the actions in warranty and in sub-warranty.\nKimpton alone appealed from this judgment and only upon his intervention. The consequence was that the judgment declaring the action well founded as against the bank became absolute. So did the decision on the actions in warranty and in sub-warranty. This situation is well explained by Glasson (Pr\u00e9cis de Proc\u00e9dure Civile, 2e \u00e9d., vol. I, no. 875) :\u2014\n* * * de m\u00eame encore l\u2019acquiescement d\u2019une partie au jugement n\u2019emp\u00eache pas l\u2019intervenant d\u2019interjeter appel de son chef, et ainsi il pourra arriver que le jugement acqui\u00e8re chose jug\u00e9e vis-\u00e0-vis de l\u2019une des parties et soit r\u00e9form\u00e9 sur l\u2019appel de l\u2019intervenant ou r\u00e9ciproquement.\nNevertheless, by a majority of three to two, the Court of King\u2019s Bench reversed the judgment of the Superior Court in toto. It dismissed the principal action against the principal defendant (who had acquiesced) with costs against the plaintiff and also the actions in warranty and in sub-warranty with costs of both actions against Waterman and the Waterman Company. This the Court of King\u2019s Bench clearly could not do. There was no appeal on those issues. The judgment of the Superior Court, to that extent, had become res judicata. Moreover, the bank, Waterman, and the Waterman company were not parties to the appeal and were not before the court. Even when they are joined to the principal action for purposes of hearing and of judgment, the actions in simple warranty remain distinct from it and are not merged by the joinder.\nThis doctrine is expounded with great lucidity by Japiot (Trait\u00e9 de Proc\u00e9dure Civile, p. 631, no. 1024) :\u2014\nSupposons qu\u2019en premi\u00e8re instance figuraient plusieurs demandeurs ou plusieurs d\u00e9fendeurs, originaires ou intervenants. La question se pose alors de savoir si l\u2019appel, interjet\u00e9 par l\u2019une des parties qui ont succomb\u00e9, va produire son effet et permettre de r\u00e9former le jugement vis-\u00e0-vis de la partie seulement qui l\u2019a interjet\u00e9, ou, en outre, vis-\u00e0-vis des autres parties qui sont dans la m\u00eame situation qu\u2019elle.\nPar exemple, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de quelques-uns d\u2019entre eux, le d\u00e9lai d\u2019appel est expir\u00e9; ils ne peuvent plus personnellement interjeter appel; mais le d\u00e9lai court encore \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019un d\u2019eux. Celui-ci interjette appel en temps utile. Les autres demandeurs ou d\u00e9fendeurs vont-ils \u00eatre relev\u00e9s de la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance par eux encourue, en ce sens qu\u2019ils pourront figurer dans l\u2019instance d\u2019appel, y conclure et demander la r\u00e9formation du jugement dans leur int\u00e9r\u00eat?\nLe sens commun indique que celui-l\u00e0 seul sauvegarde son droit et le met \u00e0 l\u2019abri des causes d\u2019an\u00e9antissement, qui l\u2019exerce avec les formalit\u00e9s prescrites et dans les d\u00e9lais impartis par la loi: Jura vigilantibus subveniunt, non dormientibus. Chacun des plaideurs, en principe, ne sauvegarde par ses actes que son propre int\u00e9r\u00eat. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, l\u2019appel ne profite qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019auteur de\u2019 l\u2019appel; le jugement ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9form\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 son profit. Voil\u00e0 une premi\u00e8re r\u00e8gle.\nThe author then points out that there are exceptions to this rule in cases where the obligation is joint and several or indivisible. The exception does not apply here.\nWe also find the same doctrine in Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, verbo Appel en mati\u00e8re civile, no-. 322:\u2014\nL\u2019application des r\u00e8gles qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 certaines difficult\u00e9s dans le cas o\u00f9 l\u2019instance s\u2019est trouv\u00e9e compliqu\u00e9e par une demande en garantie. Il y a lieu, pour les r\u00e9soudre, de distinguer suivant que le demandeur originaire a obtenu gain de cause ou a perdu son proc\u00e8s contre le garanti.\nSi le demandeur originaire a obtenu gain de cause contre le garanti, il est certain que celui-ci peut et doit appeler contre lui. Il en est ainsi, tant en mati\u00e8re de garantie simple qu\u2019en mati\u00e8re de garantie formelle, et, dans ce dernier cas, alors m\u00eame que le garanti se serait fait mettre hors de cause, en vertu de l\u2019art. 182 C. proc., car, en pareil cas, bien que n\u2019\u00e9tant pas rest\u00e9 dans l\u2019instance, il a int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 appeler, puisque la condamnation doit s\u2019ex\u00e9cuter contre lui (Chauveau et Carr\u00e9, t. 4, q. 1581 quater; Boitard, Colmet-Daage et Glasson, t. 2, n\u00b0 672; Garsonnet, t, 5, n\u00b0 694).\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench also maintained the intervention, which was the only matter properly involved in the appeal.\nWe have already indicated that, in our opinion, the intervenant was wrong and, on that point, the judgment of the Superior Court ought to have been confirmed. The difficulty lies in the fact that the Montreal Agencies alone appealed to this court and its notice of appeal was only against Kimpton. At first, we had some doubt whether, under these circumstances, without having the bank and the other parties before us as respondents, our view being in favour of restoring the judgment of the Superior Court on the intervention, we could deal with that part of the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench which dismissed the principal action against the defendant as well as the action in warranty (save for costs) and the action in sub-warranty.\nWe have come to the conclusion that we can.\nThe judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench was rendered upon an appeal exclusively between Kimpton and the Montreal Agencies. This judgment is ultra vires, so far as the bank, Waterman and the Waterman company are concerned. It is therefore quasi non-existent and cannot affect them, as they were not parties to the appeal. This judgment can neither avail against them, nor can they claim any right under it. We have before us the same parties who were before the Court of King\u2019s Bench and as to whom alone the appeal was heard and could be decided. We think therefore the whole judgment open for discussion and disposal by us. By force of section 51 of the Supreme Court Act, this court may\ngive the judgment and award the process or other proceeding which the court whose decision is appealed against should have given or awarded.\nThe decision appealed against was the outcome of an appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, in which the Montreal Agencies Limited and Kimpton alone participated. Upon the appeal to this court between the same parties, we can deal with that decision as irregular and ultra vires and give the judgment which should have been given by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, so as to leave its full effect to the judgment of the Superior Court, thus reversed illegally and without right.\nThe judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench will therefore be set aside with costs against Kimpton and the judgment of the Superior Court will be restored.\nThe result is that the Montreal Agencies Limited is declared entitled to the full amount of the commission it claimed from the bank and the tactions in warranty and in sub-warranty are maintained. The appellant may yet have to account to Kimpton for half of the commission. This question does not arise now and will be left for decision upon an issue properly raised between the Montreal Agencies and Kimpton. The issue here was, and could only be, whether the bank owed that commission to Montreal Agencies.\nAs regards the position of the warrantors, had the intervention been successful in this court, while the judgment of the Superior Court had been allowed to become res judicata on the actions in warranty and in sub-warranty, we refer the parties to Archibald v. Delisle[2], where it was held that actions to enforce simple or personal warranties issued before judgment upon the principal action, are brought at the risk of the warrantees, and fall if the principal action be subsequently dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Wainwright, Elder & McDougall.\nSolicitors for the Bank of Nova Scotia: Atwater, Bond & Beauregard.\n[1] [1910] A.C. 614 at p. 625.\n[2] 25 Can.

(Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nLa Banque Canadienne Nationale (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1927: May 17, 18; 1927: October 4.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Newcombe, Rinfret and Lamond JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nSale\u2014Pulpwood\u2014Unfinished product\u2014Loan by a bank\u2014Valid lien\u2014Measuring and stamping by purchaser\u2014Transfer of ownership\u2014Bank Act, s. 88\u2014Arts. 1026, 1027, 1474, 1488, 1489, 1684, 2268 C.C.\nUnder section 88 of the Bank Act, a bank, as security for advances made, may acquire a lien on \u201cproducts of the forest\u201d as defined by section 2, subsection (m) or on goods, wares and merchandise, as defined by section 2, subsection (g), to be manufactured, or in process of manufacture, although the finished product will come into existence only after the process of manufacture is completed.\nTherefore, the owner of a timber license, who proposes to go into the forest to cut down the trees and transform them into what is commercially known as pulpwood and who may require financial assistance from a bank before the pulpwood is produced in its commercial form, can give the bank which assists him a valid lien on the finished product, although not in existence as such at the time of the loan.\nIn the present case, the measuring and stamping of the wood done in the forest by the purchaser, while the wood remained in the possession of the seller, did not amount to a sufficient determination of the subject matter of the contract or to a taking of actual possession of the wood, so as to enable the purchaser to claim ownership of the wood against a valid lien obtained by a bank for advances made to the seller. To determine the effect of a lien acquired by a bank under section 88 of the Bank Act, the provisions of that Act, and not those of the Quebec Civil Code, should be looked at.\nNo opinion expressed whether a purchaser in good faith of particular goods, in the usual course of business, such as a table bought from a furniture manufacturer or dealer, acquires a valid title as against a bank\u2019s lien.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 43 K.B. 435) aff.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, at Quebec, Pouliot J., and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the judgment now reported.\nJ. P. A. Gravel K.C. for the appellant.\nE. Baillargeon K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014In 1923 and 1924, one Silvio Gendron was a lumber merchant dealing in pulpwood. He had obtained timber licenses and his mode of operation was to cut down the trees and saw them into four foot lengths of a diameter of not less than four inches. Either before or after the sawing, the bark was peeled off, and all the contracts filed in the case deal with the pulpwood as peeled pulpwood.\nGendron started cutting operations some time in the summer of 1923 (the evidence does not shew the exact date) on, among other lots, nos. 39 and 40 of the fourth range of the township of Chabot, in the county of Frontenac, in the province of Quebec, being there represented by his brother, who appears to have very grossly exaggerated the quantity of pulpwood he reported as having been manufactured.\nDealing with the facts chronologically, as far as possible, we find Silvio Gendron soliciting, on June 8, 1923, from La Banque Nationale (hereinafter called the bank, and now represented by the respondent) a line of credit of $15,000. On that date, Gendron signed an application to the bank for this line of credit on the security of all the pulpwood peeled or unpeeled, \u201cbrut ou pel\u00e9,\u201d of four feet lengths, belonging, or which might belong to him, on these lots and some others, promising to furnish to the bank from time time, and when requested, all security demanded under the form of transfers, according to section 88 of the Bank Act, covering in whole or in part the pulpwood in question. At the same time, Gendron signed an agreement with the bank, defining its powers when making advances, and a demand note for $2,400, dated June 8, 1923, was discounted by him with the bank, accompanied by an hypothecation, under section 88 of the Bank Act, of the products of the forest described as\nle bois sur le lot 39-40 rg. 4 Chabot * * * et sont les suivants: 500 cds. bois pel\u00e9 et assur\u00e9 lot 39-40 Chabot.\nUndoubtedly the intention was to give the bank the security mentioned in section 88 of the Bank Act, and I do not understand the appellant to question the regularity in form of the hypothecations of the pulpwood which Gendron then and subsequently made in favour of the bank. What the appellant contends as to the lien asserted by the bank will be explained later.\nThe bank subsequently made advances to Gendron and obtained from him similar letters of hypothecation. These advances may be conveniently divided into three series:\nFirst series. The bank advanced $2,400 on June 8, 1923 (this is the advance referred to above), $900 on June 28, and $2,100 on July 10, in all $5,400.\nSecond series. The bank advanced $1,350 on August 17, 1923, $600 on September 9, $600 on September 27, and $450 on October 10, in all $3,000.\nThird series. The bank advanced $450 on November 13, 1923, $1,600 on December 12, $100 on December 26, and $274.15 on January 3, 1924, in all $2,424.15.\nIt is conceded that the bank cannot assert a lien for its second series of advances, no notice of Gendron\u2019s intention to hypothecate his pulpwood having been given and registered as required by section 88a of the Bank Act, which came into force on August 1, 1923, and does not apply to the first series of advances. No similar objection exists as to the third series, for the necessary notice was registered in due time.\nReferring now to the first and third series, each advance made by the bank to Gendron was contemporaneously secured by the hypothecation of a specific number of cords of pulpwood said to be lying on these lots. For instance, for it is not necessary to particularize each hypothecation, when the bank advanced $2,100, on July 10, 1923, Gendron hypothecated 700 cords of peeled pulpwood. It is not seriously contended on behalf of the bank that at that time any such quantity of peeled pulpwood existed on the lots. In fact, Mr. Justice Greenshields, referring to the sale made by Gendron to the appellant, on September 12, 1923, of 1,500 cords of peeled pulpwood, finds that the wood was not then in existence other than in standing trees. He also finds that up to the 19th or 20th November there had been manufactured by Gendron 817 cords of pulpwood on lots 39 and 40 of the 4th range of Chabot. On paper, Gendron hypothecated to the bank, to secure the first series of advances, 1,500 cords of peeled pulpwood said to be then on lots 39 and 40, and 3,200 cords to secure the third series. Having carefully read the testimony, I am convinced that at no time during the first or third series of advances was there any such quantity of peeled and sawn pulpwood on the lots. The cutting of the trees began during the summer, and on September 14, the appellant\u2019s inspector Turbide stamped with the latter\u2019s initials, 176 cords of sawn and corded wood, 100 cords (estimated) not corded, and 925 cords (also estimated) in lengths, and therefore not sawn. My conclusion is that when the bank, on June 8, June 28, and July 10 (to mention only the hypothecations made on these dates), acquired on paper liens on peeled pulpwood stated to aggregate 1,500 cords, no more than a very small quantity, if indeed any at all, of the pulpwood can be said to have been cut, peeled, sawn and corded. Whether this conclusion in fact militates against the lien the bank asserts on the pulpwood which was subsequently hauled from the lots, is a question which will be considered later.\nOn September 12, Gendron entered into a written contract with the appellant whereby he purported to sell and undertook to deliver to the latter on cars, at Picard station on the Transcontinental Railway, or at any other place where the freight rates were the same, 1,500 cords of pulpwood, free from any government or other dues, the pulpwood to conform to all conditions prescribed by law for its export to the United States, and to be made from living trees and peeled during sap time of the then present season. It was agreed that the measuring and inspection would be made by the inspectors of the mills to which the appellant would sell the wood, such measuring to be final as to both parties. The shipment of the wood was to begin on the 1st of December, 1923, and to be completed on the 1st of July, 1924, according to shipping instructions to be furnished by the appellant, but all the wood was to be brought to the place whence it was to be shipped not later than the 1st of April, 1924. The sale price was $11.25 per cord, and it was to be paid as follows: An advance of $4 per cord was stipulated payable up to November 15, that is to say $4,000 if all the wood was peeled and 500 cords sawn and corded, and the balance (of such $4 per cord) on the 15th of November if all the wood was sawn and corded at that date. Another advance of $6 per cord was to be made on the bills of lading as the shipping proceeded, but if the shipment could not be effected during the winter,\nce montant de $6 sera payable \u00e0 terre sur estim\u00e9 de la partie de seconde part (the appellant) une fois par mois. La balance le 15 de chaque mois pour le bois re\u00e7u au moulin le mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent.\nIt was agreed that during the carrying out of the contract the appellant would have the right to stamp the wood at any place where it might be, in its name, or in the name of any person or bank with whom it might have dealings, so as to secure the advances, and that until the wood was delivered on cars, it would be at the sole risk of the seller. By an addition to the contract, it was stipulated that if the wood was not shipped prior to the 15th of April by reason of the purchaser not furnishing shipping instructions, the insurance would be payable by the purchaser but otherwise it would be at the seller\u2019s charge.\nImmediately after the signing of the contract, the appellant sent its inspector, Turbide, to the lots where the wood was being cut, and on September 14, Turbide, as above stated, stamped with the appellant\u2019s initials, 176 cords sawn and corded, 100 cords sawn but not corded, and in lengths, that is to say in trees that had been cut down but not sawn, about 925 cords. The measuring and stamping, Turbide explains, was done as well as was possible, and he did not consider it a final measuring, for \u201cle bois \u00e9tait mal cord\u00e9 pour \u00eatre mesur\u00e9 finalement.\u201d\nBefore entering into the contract, the appellant was assured by Gendron that there were no bank liens on the wood, and it demanded a letter to that effect from Gendron\u2019s bankers. Gendron furnished the appellant with a letter from the manager of the branch of the Hochelaga Bank (with whom he had not dealt for some time) at Sainte Marie de Beauce, stating that, as far as his branch was concerned, the bank had no lien on the wood. The dealings of Gendron with La Banque Nationale were carried on at its branch office at St. Evariste Station, and of these dealings, or of any lien obtained by La Banque Nationale, the appellant had no knowledge, but effected its purchase in absolute good faith.\nAfter the contract and stamping of the wood, the appellant made the following advances on the contract price to Gendron, who represented that he required the money to pay his men; $3,000 on September 15, $500 on October 29, $656 on November 22, and $500 on December 1, in all $4,656. Previously to the two latter advances, on November 19, the appellant\u2019s inspector, C. Landry, measured, and he states that he stamped with the appellant\u2019s initials, on lots 39 and 40, 817 cords of pulpwood, sawn and corded, and at Rivi\u00e8re Bleue 46 cords sawn and corded, and 250 cords in lengths. It may be taken, I think, that this represented all the pulpwood that had been manufactured and corded by Gendron and his representatives up to that date.\nOn January 14, 1924, Gendron admitted his inability to carry out his contract with the appellant, and he then stated that he had in the woods for delivery under that contract, about 1,400 cords, of which 1,100 were deliverable at Picard Station and 300 at Rivi\u00e8re Bleue, but that he could not haul the wood to the stations for want of money. An agreement was therefore made between the appellant and Gendron on that date whereby the former undertook the hauling of the wood, but at Gendron\u2019s expense.\nUnder this agreement the appellant started hauling the pulpwood in January, 1924, and had hauled some 200 cords of wood when, on the 12th or 13th of February, the bank sent two inspectors to stamp the wood in its name. It was only then that the appellant learned that Gendron had pledged the pulpwood to the bank.\nBoth the appellant and the bank realized that it was of prime importance that the wood should be hauled to the railway station, and on February 16, 1924, they entered into a contract whereby, while saving their respective rights, it was agreed that the appellant should continue hauling the wood, the expense to be borne, including the 200 cords already hauled, by the party who finally would be held entitled to a first lien on the wood. The appellant completed the hauling, the quantity hauled amounting to 840 cords, and sold the wood for $9,388.45. The actual cost of hauling, as admitted by the respondent and allowed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, was $5,542.79, and the respondent claims the difference, $3,845.66, alleging that it has a valid lien on the wood. On the other hand, the appellant contends that it acquired the ownership of the wood as well by the purchase it made from Gendron, as by its having stamped the wood with its initials. It further argues that when the wood was hypothecated to the bank in June and July, 1923, there was no pulpwood in existence, and no lien could be created, and that any lien acquired by the bank by reason of the third series of advances was subject to the appellant\u2019s acquired rights.\nThe trial court dismissed the respondent\u2019s action on the ground that, as to the first series of advances, there was no evidence that the pulpwood hypothecated was in existence, and that at the time of the third series of advances the appellant had an acquired right to the wood. The learned trial judge disregarded the second series of advances for the reason already stated that no notice of intention to hypothecate the wood had been registered as required by section 88a of the Bank Act.\nThis judgment was set aside by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, which awarded $3,845.66 to the present respondent, that is to say the amount realized by the sale of pulpwood, less the cost of hauling. The majority of the learned judges (Greenshields, Bernier and Hall JJ.) were of opinion that the bank had a valid lien on the wood, except as to the second series of advances, and that the appellant had never become owner thereof. Dorion and Rivard JJ. dissented. They considered that although the present appellant had not acquired the ownership of the wood by the contract of sale, the subsequent stamping by it of the wood with its initials had sufficiently identified the subject matter of the sale, so that the present appellant become thereby vested with a right of ownership or at least a right of pledge over the wood. The learned dissenting judges, however, thought that the appellant was not entitled to more than the 276 cords of pulpwood which had been sawn into four foot lengths, corded and uncorded, when Turbide stamped the wood on September 14, 1923. They would have granted the present respondent judgment for $2,568.62, representing 541 cords out of the total quantity, 817 cords, measured by G. Landry on November 19. In their opinion the bank acquired a lien on the wood not stamped by Turbide by virtue of its third series of advances, but not under the first series, the pulpwood not being then in existence.\nThis appeal brings up two questions:\u2014\n1. Did the bank acquire under section 88 of the Bank Act a valid lien on the 840 cords of pulpwood hauled by the appellant from lots 39 and 40 of the fourth range of the township of Chabot?\n2. Did the appellant acquire ownership of the pulpwood by virtue of its purchase from Gendron or at least by its stamping of the wood, so as to take it free from the bank\u2019s lien?\nThe first and certainly the most important question involves the construction and application of section 88 of the Bank Act.\nBriefly, this section permits a bank to lend money to, inter alios, any dealer in products of the forest upon the security of such products (subs. 1), or to any person engaged in business as a wholesale manufacturer of any goods, wares and merchandise, upon the security of the goods, wares and merchandise manufactured by him (subs. 3). This security confers on the bank the same rights and powers in respect of the products, goods, wares and merchandise, stock or products thereof, as if it had acquired the same by virtue of a warehouse receipt (subs. 7).\nThe expression \u201cproducts of the forest\u201d is defined by s. 2, subs. (m) as including inter alia, bark, logs, pulpwood, piling, spars, railway ties, poles, mining and all other timber, shingles, laths, deals, boards, staves, and all other lumber. Subsection (i) of the same section defines \u201cmanufacturer\u201d as including manufacturers of logs, timber or lumber, etc. And \u201cgoods, wares and merchandise\u201d include \u201cproducts of the forest\u201d (s. 2, subs. (g)). With respect I am unable to concur in the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Dorion as follows:\nIl est donc n\u00e9cessaire, pour que la banque ait acquis un droit de gage pour les avances faites le 8 juin, le 28 juin et le 10 juillet, 1923, au montant de $5,400, que ce gage ait eu un objet, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, qu\u2019il y ait eu, \u00e0 ces diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9poques, du bois coup\u00e9 sur les lots 39 et 40 du rang 4 du canton Chabot, comme il est dit dans le contrat: 500 cordes de bois pel\u00e9 et assur\u00e9 sur ces lots le 8 juin; 300 cordes sur le lot 40 le 28 juin; et 300 cordes sur le lot 40 le 10 juillet, 1923.\nUnquestionably the bank\u2019s lien must have an object, but in my opinion it had an object in the three instances mentioned by the learned judge. As I read section 88, a bank, for its advances, may acquire a lien on the products of the forest (as defined) or on goods, wares and merchandise (also as defined) to be manufactured, or in process of manufacture, although the finished product will come into existence only after the process of manufacture is completed.\nThe present case affords an apt illustration of the object Parliament undoubtedly had in view when it enacted section 88, this object being to come to the assistance both of the manufacturer of goods, and of the bank which lends him money for the purposes of his business. Thus the owner of a timber license proposes to go into the forest, to cut down the trees and transform them into what is commercially known as pulpwood. Before the pulpwood is produced in its commercial form, considerable expense is necessary to cut the trees, peel off the bark and saw them into the required lengths. The manufacturer of pulpwood therefore requires financial assistance from the outset, and unless he can give the bank that assists him a lien on the finished product, although not then in existence, his business cannot be carried on.\nThis, in my opinion, is a reasonable construction of section 88, and it is not unsupported by authority (see Royal Canadian Bank v. Ross)[2]. It follows that by the first series of its advances and the contemporaneous hypothecation of the pulpwood (and I need not consider the third series), the bank acquired a valid lien on the pulpwood manufactured on these lots. Whether it can set up this lien against the appellant is the second question which must now be considered. I think that the sale by Gendron to the appellant of 1,500 cords of sawn and peeled pulpwood, taken by itself, did not vest in the appellant the ownership of any specific pulpwood. On this point, all the learned judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench have agreed. At the time the sale was made no such quantity of pulpwood was in existence. The most that can be said is that it was then in process of manufacture, and the place where it was to be manufactured was not even mentioned in the contract. Of this there can be no doubt. See articles 1026, 1474 and 1684 of the Civil Code.\nSuch measuring and stamping of the wood as were done by Turbide, on September 14, and by C. Landry, on November 19 (and Landry\u2019s testimony is rather unsatisfactory as to this stamping, the only statement that he then stamped the wood being at the close of his cross-examination), did not, in my opinion, amount to a sufficient determination of the subject matter of the contract, or to a taking of actual possession of the pulpwood. Neither Turbide nor Landry considered that they had finally measured the wood. At the most, what they did was a precautionary measure which later would help to identify the wood on which the appellant had made advances. According to the contract, the object of the marking was not to constitute a delivery into the actual possession of the purchaser, but \u201cafin de garantir les avances faites sur le dit bois.\u201d The parties however could not create a lien or pledging outside of the conditions prescribed by law, and the circumstances were not those required by the code to confer on the appellant such a right on the pulpwood which remained, after the stamping, in Gendron\u2019s possession.\nThe appellant at the hearing, urged that at least it had taken actual possession of the 200 cords of pulpwood which it removed from the lots, and with respect to this wood it relied on the second paragraph of article 1027 of the civil code as to the effect of actual possession of one of two competing purchasers on the title derived from a party who has successively obliged himself to both to deliver to each of them a thing which is purely movable property. The appellant also referred to articles 1488, 1489 and 2268 of the Civil Code. There is no doubt, however, that we must look solely to the Bank Act to determine the effect of a lien acquired by a bank by virtue of section 88. Since the enactment of section 88a persons dealing with a merchant or manufacturer are protected by the notice which must now be given and registered of the intention to create a lien under section 88. In this case we do not have to determine whether a purchaser in good faith of particular goods, in the usual course of business, such as a table bought from a furniture manufacturer or dealer, acquires a valid title as against the bank\u2019s lien. No such case has been made out here. Gendron\u2019s undertaking was to sell to the appellant what turned out to be in excess of his whole output, and the appellant realized that it should obtain from him some evidence that there was no banker\u2019s lien on the pulpwood. Gendron dishonestly deceived the appellant, but for that the bank was in no way to blame. The lien it acquired was a valid lien which, I think, can be set up against the appellant, even as to the 200 cords which the latter hauled from the lots.\nThe result is that the appellant is accountable to the respondent for the price it obtained by the sale of the pulpwood, less the cost of the hauling which has been credited to it.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Drolet & Tardif.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Belleau, Baillargeon, Belleau & Hudon.\n[1] (1927) Q.R. 43 K.B. 435.\n[2] 40 U.C.R. 466, at p. 475.\n",

(Gray v. Smith, 43 Gh. D. 208; Shipwright v. Clements, 19 W.R. 599; Lindley on Partnership, 9th Ed. 541, referred to).\nPlaintiff claimed specific performance of an alleged agreement by defendants to sell to plaintiff their interests in a manufacturing business carried on by plaintiff and defendants as partners. The agreement was contained in letters between the parties\u2019 solicitors, and the consideration was expressed to be \u201con the basis of taking the valuation of the building, machinery and fixtures at $15,000\u201d and \u201cstock, etc., to be taken at 100 cents on the dollar.\u201d The partnership assets consisted of the factory, including the land on which it stood, the machinery therein, and the articles affixed thereto, the tools, furniture and equipment used, two motor trucks, the stock in trade, and the book accounts. Defendants contended that the good-will also was to be considered as an asset.\nHeld: The letters showed an agreement sufficiently certain and unambiguous in its terms that the obligations of the parties could be clearly ascertained; on the evidence, including the firm accounts, the parties meant by the words \u201cbuilding, machinery and fixtures,\u201d to cover all the physical assets except the stock and the trucks; and by the words \u201cstock, etc.,\u201d to cover the stock in trade, the book accounts, and the trucks; and by the words \u201c100 cents on the dollar\u201d that plaintiff was to pay the full present value, as shown on the books. Under the language of the agreement the $15,000 should be taken to include the amount of an existing mortgage on the building. No allowance should be made for good-will, the letters not mentioning it, and the Court finding, on the evidence, that, when authorizing their solicitor to state their terms, defendants had no intention of asking additional consideration for it.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba (36 Man. R. 193), granting plaintiff specific performance of the agreement, affirmed, with a slight variation increasing the amount payable by plaintiff.\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] which, reversing the judgment of Galt J., granted to the plaintiff specific performance of an alleged agreement by the defendants to sell to the plaintiff their interests in the partnership business carried on by them. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs, with a variation of the judgment below by adding the price of certain motor trucks to the amounts payable by the plaintiff.\nC. H. Locke K.C. for the appellants.\nE. Lafleur K.C. and S. Abrahamson for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014In this action the plaintiff claims specific performance of an agreement made with the defendants for the sale by them of their respective interests in the Chicago Kosher Sausage Manufacturing Company. This company was a partnership in which the plaintiff and defendants were the sole partners. The partnership agreement was a verbal one and was entered into on April 15, 1924. The terms of the agreement appear to have been that the profits should be divided equally; that if any partner desired to withdraw from the partnership he might do so by giving thirty days\u2019 notice and he could take with him his share, and that in other respects the terms were to be those embodied in a former agreement between the plaintiff, the defendant Bloom and one Schulman. That agreement contained the following clause:\nIn case of any disagreement between the parties as to any matters in connection with the said business or the division of the property, effects or profits or losses in connection with the said partnership, the same shall be determined by Arbitration * * *\nTrouble arose among the partners and, about December 1, 1925, Dworkin notified his partners that he wished to withdraw from the partnership. A couple of days later, during a discussion of their affairs, Bloom also signified his desire to withdraw. Dworkin urged the appointment of arbitrators at once; Bloom was willing, but the plaintiff thought it was not necessary until near the expiration of the thirty days set out in the notice. The result of this discussion was that they all agreed to go to the office of the firm\u2019s solicitor, Mr. Hyman, on the following Saturday, December 5. This they did. Hyman advised against dissolution but finding it impossible to reconcile the differences existing between the partners he sent them home to think it over and requested each partner to see him privately. They did so but nothing came of it.\nOn December 12, according to the evidence of defendants and Hyman, there was another meeting in Hyman\u2019s office at which all the partners were present and at which the question of arbitration was discussed at length and during which they say the question of the good-will was also brought up. The plaintiff denies being at that meeting. Whether or not he was present is, in my opinion, immaterial, for it is admitted that nothing was accomplished by it. The partners were not reconciled nor did they arrive at any agreement as to what was to be done with the business. Hyman testified that it was not decided at the meeting on December 12 who was to continue the business or who was to retire therefrom. Dworkin testified that after the meeting his impression was that they were going to appoint arbitrators. That was the last meeting of the partners. On December 16 the plaintiff engaged the firm of Abrahamson & Greenberg as his solicitors, and the following correspondence took place between that firm and Mr. Hyman\u2019s firm which was acting for the defendants.\n(1)\nDecember 18, 1925.\nMessrs.

What our Mr. Hyman said was that he did not think that Mr. Bloom would have any objection or that any difficulty would arise therefrom.\nOn behalf of Bloom we are instructed to say that he will retire from the business on the same basis as Dworkin, namely that the building, machinery and fixtures be valued at $15,000.\nWe take it that inventory of the stock will be taken forthwith by arrangement between the parties.\nYours truly,\nHyman & Hestrin.

In reply, on behalf of our client, we beg to accept the offer submitted by you on behalf of Mr. Bloom. In view of the fact that Mr. Bloom is disposing of his interest of the business to our client, it is unnecessary to pursue the controversy raised in your letter in regard to Mr. Bloom\u2019s consent. We are prepared to have the matter closed at any day suitable to yourselves.\nYours truly,\nAbrahamson & Greenberg. Per S.G.\nThe plaintiff offered to complete the purchase on the terms contained in the above letters but the defendants refused to carry out the agreement. The plaintiff then brought this action. The trial judge dismissed the action on the ground that the partners were never ad idem, in that the defendants had always insisted on their right to receive consideration for their interest in the good-will of the business, and that the letters made no provision therefor. The Court of Appeal (Macdonald J., K.B., ad hoc, dissenting) reversed this decision and directed that the agreement be specifically performed[2]. The defendants now seek to set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and to restore that of the trial judge, on the following grounds:\n1. That the defendants\u2019 solicitors had no authority to make the offers contained in the letters.\n2. That the agreements contained in the letters are too uncertain to be enforced in that they do not specify what assets were to be included in \u201cbuilding, machinery and fixtures\u201d nor whether the $15,000 to be paid therefor was to be exclusive of the mortgage on the building.\n3. That the agreement does not cover all the assets.\n4. That in agreeing to the terms contained in the letters, if they did so agree, the defendants understood that the good-will was to be valued and paid for.\nIn my opinion Mr. Hyman, who wrote the letters of December 19 and December 23, on behalf of the defendants, had from each authority to do so. The defendant Bloom on his examination for discovery admitted that Hyman told him of the letter of 22nd December from the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors, and also of the reply of December 23. As to the reply he says he consented to its terms and that the contents of the letter were correct. The defendant Dworkin on his examination for discovery admitted having seen the letter of December 18. He says he did not see Hyman\u2019s letter of December 19 until after it was mailed, but when he did see a copy of it he approved of its contents. In view of these admissions it is, in my opinion, idle for the defendants now to contend that they did not authorize the offers made on their behalf respectively.\nThen do the letters shew an agreement so certain and unambiguous in its terms that the obligations of the parties can be clearly ascertained?\nIt is suggested that had the letters been handed to a lawyer to prepare a formal contract therefrom, he would not have been able to determine what assets were to be included in the term \u201cbuilding, machinery and fixtures,\u201d or what were to be covered by \u201cstock, etc.\u201d It may be that he would not, but that is not the test. The test is, did the parties themselves clearly understand what was comprised in each. In other words were their minds ad idem as to these expressions?\nIt is common ground that the partnership assets consisted of,\n1. The factory, including the partnership land upon which it was situated, the machinery therein, and the articles affixed thereto, the tools, furniture and equipment used in the factory, and two motor trucks.\n2. The stock in trade.\n3. The book accounts.\nIn addition the defendants contend that the good-will was to be considered as an asset.\nIt is admitted by all parties that by the word \u201cbuilding\u201d they intended to include not only the buildings on the partnership land, but the land as well. As to \u201cmachinery\u201d no question arises. \u201cFixtures\u201d ordinarily mean something attached or affixed to the soil, or to a building forming a part thereof. Here, however, evidence was put in which shews that in the minds of the partners the word \u201cfixtures\u201d had a wider meaning. The defendants put in evidence a loose leaf ledger account shewing a valuation of the physical assets of the partnership, other than the stock-in-trade, under the following heads: \u201cBuilding Account,\u201d \u201cMachinery Account,\u201d \u201cOffice Fixtures\u201d \u201cFactory Fixtures,\u201d and \u201cCars Account.\u201d Dworkin in his evidence testified that the \u201coffice fixtures\u201d consisted of a safe, two typewriting machines, adding machine, two desks, two chairs, stationery and things of that kind.\nIn the account of \u201cfactory fixtures\u201d were entered such transactions as the sale of a horse and wagon; the purchase of a kettle; the sale of a sleigh, and a slicer.\nThis evidence, in my opinion, establishes that the term \u201cfixtures\u201d in the minds of the partners covered not only such things as were affixed to the factory, but all the furniture, tools and equipment contained therein, or used therewith. It did not, however, include the two motor trucks which were entered separately under \u201cCars Account,\u201d and were valued at $475.\nBy the term \u201cbuilding, machinery and fixtures,\u201d therefore, the partners meant all the physical assets except the stock and the trucks.\nThe term \u201cstock, etc.,\u201d would clearly include the stock in trade.\nAs to the book accounts the plaintiff testified that they were \u201cstock,\u201d and both defendants admitted that the plaintiff was to pay 100 cents on the dollar for the book accounts. They must, therefore, have understood that they came under the term \u201cstock, etc.\u201d\nThe only remaining assets were the two motor trucks and, as the defendants admit that it was intended that all their interest in the partnership should pass to the plaintiff, they must have understood that the trucks came in under the same heading.\nWhat the partners meant by \u201c100 cents on the dollar\u201d is, I think, also clear. At the trial the defendant Bloom gave the following testimony.\nQ. You say you set the $15,000 as the valuation of the building, machinery and fixtures. How were you going to settle on the value of the rest of the things?\nA. That is just according to the books.\nThe books contained a valuation of the various assets of the firm made when the partnership began. This was brought up to date each year by adding thereto the value of additional assets secured, and by deducting therefrom the value of assets no longer in the firm\u2019s possession. They shewed the amount allowed in 1924 for depreciation and also the present value of the assets under each account at the end of the year. When, therefore, the defendant Bloom says they were going to fix the value of the assets, other than the building, machinery and fixtures, according to the books, that, in my opinion, meant that the plaintiff was to pay the full present value, that is the value as set out in the books for 1924, with such deductions for depreciation for the year 1925 as would be reasonable. What these should be the parties themselves have shewn by the entries under date of December 31, 1925, which, for the purposes of computation may, I think, be accepted. It was contemplated that stock would be taken, and they took stock, setting down the raw material on hand and its cost to the firm. They did not reach the point of computing the additional cost to be added for such goods as had been manufactured, but the evidence is that such cost is shewn in the books.\nAs that is certain which can be made certain by a reference to the books I do not find any uncertainty or ambiguity in the agreement, for the argument that the mortgage on the building was not to be deducted from the $15,000 is, I think, completely answered by the language of the offer itself, and the further contention that Bloom offered to sell only his interest in the building, machinery and fixtures, is answered by his own admission. Unless, therefore, the parties understood and intended that the good-will should be valued and paid for, the agreement covered all the assets and should be specifically performed.\nWith reference to the good-will, I think it is clear law that where one partner for a specific consideration agrees to retire and assigns all his interest in the partnership business to the remaining partners, that assignment conveys to the remaining partners the retiring partner\u2019s interest in the good-will without express mention, and, unless it has been specifically agreed that the remaining partners shall pay for it separately, they cannot be called upon to make any additional payment for the good-will, for it belongs to them by virtue of their ownership of the business. Gray v. Smith[3]; Shipwright v. Clements[4]; Lindley on Partnership, 9th ed., 541.\nThe agreement as contained in the letters makes no mention of good-will. It is, however, said that it was in the contemplation of the parties that it should be paid for, because at every meeting they discussed the question of arbitration. I have no doubt they did discuss the question of arbitration at each meeting. Dworkin insisted on the partners appointing arbitrators and Bloom agreed thereto. Dworkin, however, in his evidence stated the purpose for which they were to be appointed as follows:\nQ. You say the appointment of arbitrators was for what purpose?\nA. For the purpose of dissolution\u2014winding up the partnership and bringing the whole thing to a head.\nThe arbitration, therefore, which the parties had in view in their discussions was not, as the defendants tried to make it appear at the trial, for the purpose of valuing the goodwill, but it was for the purpose of securing a dissolution of the partnership. It must necessarily have been so. Dworkin had the right to withdraw and get his share. If neither of his partners would purchase his interest the only way Dworkin could get his share was by a dissolution of the partnership and a distribution of the assets. The arbitrators had no power to compel any one partner to purchase another partner\u2019s interest. If the partnership was dissolved there could be no question of valuing the good-will, for there would be no good-will to value.\nNow on December 12 it was admitted by the defendants and Hyman that no agreement had been reached as to who would buy the others out and that they could see nothing for it but arbitration. That this meant dissolution seems to be borne out by the letter of Mr. Hyman of December 19, where he says:\nIn the event of your client not consenting to the above suggestion the only alternative remaining is arbitration under the partnership agreement.\nHere arbitration is declared to be an alternative to purchase by the plaintiff. It was an intimation to the plaintiff that if he did not accept the offer there must be a dissolution.\nA perusal of the evidence for the defence satisfies me that when the defendants authorized Hyman to state the terms upon which they would retire from the business they had no intention of asking any additional consideration for the good-will.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed with the variation I have mentioned in respect to the trucks. For these the plaintiff should pay the value set out in the books under date of December, 1925. The costs of this appeal should be borne by the defendants.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nJudgment below varied.\nSolicitors for the appellant Bloom: Machray, Sharpe, Locke, Parker & Crawley.\nSolicitors for the appellant Dworkin: Hyman & Hestrin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Abrahamson & Greenberg.\n[1] 36 Man.

Grant (Defendant) Respondent.\n1927: June 8, 9; 1927: October 4.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nPatent\u2014Infringement\u2014Patent Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 69, and amendments\u2014Application for patent within extended period allowed by article 83 of Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920\u2014Patent issued after amendment to Patent Act in 1921, c. 44\u2014Question whether terms of article 83 or of ss. 6 and 7 of c. 44 of 1921 applicable as to parties\u2019 rights\u2014\u201cRight of industrial property\u201d (article 83)\u2014Construction of statutes\u2014Repeal by implication\u2014Vested rights.\nA. (plaintiff\u2019s assignor), a citizen of the United States of America, patented a device there on October 6, 1914. He failed to apply for a Canadian patent within the year allowed by s. 8 of the Patent Act (R.S.C. 1906, c. 69), but applied for it on July 10, 1920, just before the expiry of the extended period allowed therefor by article 83 of the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920. The letter accompanying the petition stated it was filed under the provisions of that Order. The patent was not issued until March 7, 1922. In the meantime c. 44 of 1921, amending the Patent Act, was passed. The patent recited compliance with the requirements of the Patent Act (R.S.C. 1906, c. 69) and amendments thereto, and was granted \u201csubject to the conditions contained in the Act aforesaid.\u201d Defendant, as a private citizen, had manufactured, used and sold the device prior to January 10, 1920, and continued to do so, and was sued for infringement of the patent.\nHeld, the patent was not \u201cgranted or validated under the provisions\u201d of s. 6 or s. 7 of c. 44 of 1921, and, therefore, defendant could not invoke the conditions in subs. 2 of s. 7; the patent issued under authority of said article 83, under the terms of which the defendant was not protected, as he could not claim, by virtue of his manufacture, use and sale of the device prior to January 10, 1920, to have acquired and be in possession of a \u201cright of industrial property\u201d within the meaning of that article; to speak of a right open to be exercised by any person outside the United States as a \u201cright of industrial property\u201d subsisting in an individual who happened to exercise it, involves a wrong conception of \u201cproperty.\u201d\nSaid article 83 was not repealed by implication by s. 6 or s. 7 of c. 44 of 1921. Moreover, A. had a vested right prior to that Act, by virtue of his application under article 83, to obtain a patent under, and subject only to conditions imposed by that article; and it would require clear language, even were there an express repeal, to warrant the conclusion that A.\u2019s acquired rights under article 83 were thereby so seriously impaired as they would be if defendant and others in a like position should be entitled to the wider protection afforded by s. 7 (2) of c. 44 of 1921 (Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 1, s. 19; Lewis v. Hughes [1916] 1 K.B. 831).\nThe phrase in the patent \u201csubject to the conditions contained in the Act aforesaid,\u201d while no doubt referring to the Patent Act as then amended, imported only that the patent was subject to such of the provisions of the amended Act as were upon their proper construction applicable to it.\nHeld, further, that defendant did not come within the terms of subs. 2 of s. 8 of the Patent Act.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada (Maclean J.) ([1926] Ex. C.R. 164) reversed in part.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing, as against the defendant Grant, the plaintiff\u2019s action for infringement of patent. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed with costs.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and R. S. Smart K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. B. Barron for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The plaintiff company, as holder of a patent, appeals from the judgment of the Exchequer Court dismissing its action for infringement against the defendant W. W. Grant. The respondent Grant, without cross-appeal, asks that the injunction granted against his co-defendant, W. W. Grant Ltd., be modified so as to permit of its purchasing the device in question from him. That the manufacture, use and sale by the defendant Grant, in his private capacity, of which the plaintiff complains, amounted to infringement of its patented device, unless protected by one or other of the enactments presently to be discussed, is admitted. The questions presented are\u2014which of these protective provisions is applicable, and whether that which applies affords the protection claimed.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s assignor, Armstrong, as inventor, patented the device in the United States of America on the 6th of October, 1914. He failed to make application for a Canadian patent within the year allowed by s. 8 of the Patent Act (R.S.C., c. 69). He applied, however, for a Canadian patent on the 10th of July, 1920\u2014one day before expiry of the extended period for such application allowed by article 83 of the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920 (a), hereinafter called Article 83, made under the authority of the Dominion Statute of 1919, 2nd session, chapter 30.\nThe letter of Armstrong\u2019s solicitors, accompanying his application for the Canadian patent, explicitly states that the application is filed \u201cunder the provisions of the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920.\u201d\nIn the ordinary course the patent so applied for would have issued some time before the 4th of June, 1921, when the Patent Act was amended (11-12 Geo. V, c. 44) by the\n(a) The Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920.\n83. The rights of priority, provided by Article 4 of the International Convention of Paris for the Protection of Industrial Property, of March 20, 1883, revised at Washington in 1911, or by any other Convention or Statute, for the filing or registration of applications for patents or models of utility, and for the registration of trade-marks, designs and models which have not expired on the first day of August, 1914, and those which have arisen during the war, or would have arisen but for the war, shall be extended in favour of all nationals of Germany, and of the Powers allied or associated during the war with His Majesty, until the 11th day of July, 1920.\nProvided, however, that such extension shall in no way affect the right of Germany or of any of the powers allied or associated during the war with His Majesty or of any person who before the tenth day of January, 1920, was bona fide in possession of any rights of industrial property conflicting with rights applied for by another who claims rights of priority in respect of them, to exercise such rights by itself or himself personally, or by such agents or licensees as derived their rights from it or him before the tenth day of January, 1920; and such persons shall not be amenable to any action or other process of law in respect of infringement. addition of a number of sections, including those under which the respondent claims protection, and which are numbered 6 and 7. (b).\nThe delay in issuing the patent was caused by some uncertainty in the Patent Office as to the proper interpretation of article 83, which was then the subject of litigation in the Exchequer Court. The plaintiff\u2019s patent eventually issued on the 7th of March, 1922. It recited his application and his compliance with the other requirements of the Patent Act of Canada (R.S.C., 1906, c. 69) and amendments thereto; and the grant made \u201cis subject to the conditions contained in the Act aforesaid.\u201d\nThe learned President of the Exchequer Court held that Armstrong\u2019s patent had issued on the authority of s. 8 of the Patent Act, as modified by article 83, and subject to the terms and conditions of that article, and was not granted under the authority of ss. 6 and 7 of the statute of 1921\n(b) 11-12 George V, c. 44.\n6. The rights provided by section eight of the Patent Act for the filing of applications for patents for invention which rights had not expired on the first day of August, 1914, or which rights have arisen since that date shall be, and the same are hereby extended, until the expiration of a period of six months from the coming into force of this Act, and such extension shall apply to applications upon which patents have been granted as well as to applications now pending or filed within said period. Provided, that such extension shall in no way affect the right of any person, who, before the passage of this Act, was bona fide in possession of any rights in patents or applications for patent conflicting with rights in patents granted or validated by reason of such extension, to exercise such rights himself personally or by such agents, or licensees, as derived their rights from him, before the passage of this Act, and such persons shall not be amenable to any action for infringement of any patent granted or validated by reason of such extension.\n7. (1) A patent shall not be refused on an application filed between the first day of August, 1914, and the expiration of a period of six months from the coming into force of this Act, nor shall a patent granted on such application be held invalid by reason of the invention having been patented in any other country or in any other of His Majesty\u2019s Dominions or Possessions or described in any printed publication or because it was in public use or on sale prior to the filing of the application, unless such patent or publication or such public use or sale was issued or made prior to the first day of August, 1913.\n(2) No patent granted or validated under the provisions of the next preceding section or of this section shall abridge or otherwise affect the right of any person, or his agent or agents, or his successor in business, to continue any manufacture, use or sale commenced before the coming into force of this Act by such person nor shall the continued manufacture, use, or sale by such person, or the use or sale of the devices resulting from such manufacture or use constitute an infringement. (11-12 Geo. V, c. 44). It was, therefore, not subject to the terms and conditions set forth in subsection 2 of section 7 of the latter statute. He, however, also held that the respondent Grant had by his manufacture, use and sale of the patented device prior to the 10th of January, 1920, acquired, and was in possession of, a \u201cright of industrial property\u201d which conflicted with the rights applied for by Armstrong and that the continued exercise of such right by Grant was protected by article 83.\nThe following admissions were made by the parties:\n1. The defendants, prior to June 4, 1921, commenced to manufacture and sell, and have since continued to manufacture and sell, radio receiving sets embodying the inventions described in the patents referred to in the statement of claim.\n2. The defendants, prior to and after the issue of the said letters patent, and prior to the institution of this action, have manufactured, used, and sold radio receiving sets having the electrical characteristics indicated by the attached current diagram.\nThe evidence of the respondent establishes the actual manufacture, use and sale by Grant, as a private citizen, of the device in question prior to the 10th of January, 1920. Armstrong is an American citizen and it is common knowledge that the United States of America was a \u201cPower allied or associated with His (Britannic) Majesty during the war.\u201d\nWith great respect, we are of opinion that the learned trial judge was mistaken in regarding the respondent Grant as in possession of a \u201cright of industrial property.\u201d What he did in manufacturing, using and vending the Armstrong device, then patented only in the United States of America, was merely what any other person might have done. To speak of a right thus open to be exercised by all the world outside the United States as a \u201cright of industrial property\u201d subsisting in an individual who happened to exercise it involves a conception of \u201cproperty\u201d which we are unable to accept.\nOn the other hand, we think it beyond doubt or cavil that Grant had manufactured and sold the device before the 4th of June, 1921, within the meaning of those words in subs. 2 of s. 7 of c 44 of the statute 11-12 Geo. V, so that the continuation by him of such manufacture, use and sale would not constitute an infringement of the Armstrong Canadian patent, if it was \u201cgranted or validated under the provisions of\u201d s. 6 or s. 7 of that statute. The principal question for determination, therefore, is whether the learned judge was right in holding that this latter statute is inapplicable because the plaintiff\u2019s patent was not \u201cgranted\u201d under it and that the respondent\u2019s rights (if any) must be measured by the terms of the proviso to article 83, under the authority of which, in his opinion, the Armstrong Canadian patent issued.\nWe find nothing in s. 6 or s. 7 in the Act of 1921 so inconsistent with or repugnant to article 83 that the enactment of the former should be held to imply the repeal of the latter. Repeal by implication is never favoured. Foster\u2019s Case[2]. Revocation or supersession of an earlier enactment as the result of implication arising out of a later statute occurs only when the words of the latter cannot otherwise be given reasonable effect. Kutner v. Phillips[3]; Maxwell, on Statutes, (6th Ed), pp. 280 et seq. Moreover, the presence in the Act of 1921 of s. 9, which expressly provides for the continuation in force for one year of certain orders of the Minister affecting patents, aids the view that repeal of article 83 was not intended. There appears to be no real difficulty in both these provisions operating on parallel lines. Armstrong\u2019s application was made within the delay provided for by article 83, and was otherwise in conformity with its requirements, and the patent applied for might still be granted under its authority, although its actual issue should be deferred until after the coming into force of the Act of 1921; and such a patent would, of course, be subject to the conditions imposed by article 83. But, if for any reason, the applicant could not bring himself within article 83 and therefore found himself obliged to invoke the aid of s. 6 or s. 7 of the Act of 1921\u2014then his patent \u201cgranted or validated under the provisions of\u201d one or other of those sections would equally clearly be subject to the wider restrictions contained in para. 2 of s. 7. It is only if the patent be \u201cgranted or validated\u201d under one or other of those sections, i.e., if to sustain its existence as a patent one or other of them must be invoked, that the patentee, as a condition of obtaining the further indulgence which those sections afford, is subjected to the greater curtailment in his rights for which s. 7 (2) provides. The plaintiffs are not driven to claim the aid of either s. 6 or s. 7. Their assignor\u2019s right arose and was perfected under the authority of article 83, and in that article must be found the terms and conditions to which that right is subject.\nMoreover, the plaintiff had a vested right prior to the coming into force of the Act of 1921, by virtue of his application under article 83, to obtain a patent under and subject only to conditions imposed by that article. By s. 19 of the Interpretation Act (R.S.C., 1906, c. 1) it is provided that\n19. Where any Act or enactment is repealed, or where any regulation is revoked, then, unless the contrary intention appears, such repeal or revocation shall not, save as in this section otherwise provided,\u2014\n(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued, accruing or incurred under the Act, enactment or regulation so repealed or revoked;\nIt would require clear language in the statute of 1921, even though it contained an express repeal of article 83, to warrant the conclusion that the acquired rights of Armstrong under that article were thereby so seriously impaired, as they would be if the respondent and others in a like position should be entitled to the wider protection afforded by subs. 2 of s. 7. Lewis v. Hughes[4]. A fortiori would it be difficult to attach such a consequence to a repeal by mere implication of article 83.\nThe phrase in the patent \u201csubject to the conditions contained in the Act aforesaid\u201d no doubt refers to the Patent Act as then amended, but it imports only that the patent is subject to such of the provisions of the amended statute as are upon their proper construction applicable to it.\nIt has also been suggested that the defendant Grant comes within the provisions of subs. 2 of s. 8 of the Patent Act (R.S.C., 1906, c. 69), because Armstrong did not, \u201cwithin three months after the date of the issue\u201d of his American patent in 1914, give notice to the Canadian Commissioner of his intention to apply for a patent in Canada. The evidence does not disclose any manufacture of the Armstrong device by Grant prior to 1919, whereas, under subs. 2 of s. 8, protection is afforded only if the manufacture of the device has begun within the period of one year after the issue of the foreign patent, within which, under s. 8, the inventor may obtain a Canadian patent. Grant\u2019s case, therefore, is not within the terms of subs. 2 of s. 8. Nor can the period fixed by that subsection be prolonged to cover the extended time during which the inventor was allowed to obtain a patent under article 83 of the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920. There is no express extension by that Order of the period of one year named in subs. 2 of s. 8 of the Revised Statute and implication of such an extension is excluded by the fact that article 83 itself contains a specific protective proviso, which, while allowing a more extended period for its operation, restricts the protection it affords to persons \u201cbona fide in possession of any rights of industrial property.\u201d\nFor these reasons we are of the opinion that the learned President of the Exchequer Court was right in holding that the only protection which the respondent can invoke is that afforded by the proviso to article 83, but, as already stated, he had, in our opinion, acquired no \u201cright of industrial property\u201d within the meaning of that proviso.\nThe appeal will accordingly be allowed with costs. The judgment dismissing the action as against W. W. Grant will be set aside and judgment will be entered for the plaintiff, appellant, in terms similar to those in which it has already been entered against his co-defendant corporation, infringements found to have been committed by him being restricted, however, to his manufacture, use and sale of the patented device in his capacity as a private citizen.\nThe suggested modification in the judgment as against the defendant corporation need not be further considered.\nAppeal allowed with costs\nSolicitor for the appellant: Russel S.

Code, s. 303)\u2014Judge\u2019s charge to jury\u2014Misdirection in a material matter\u2014Appeal\u2014Onus of Crown\u2014Miscarriage of justice (Cr. Code, s. 1014 (1) (c)).\nThe judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, 61 Ont. L.R. 147, affirming appellant\u2019s conviction on a charge of using means to procure abortion, contrary to s. 303 of the Cr. Code, was reversed, and the conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered, on the ground that there was non-direction, tantamount in the circumstances to misdirection, in a material matter, in the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury, in that he cast doubt, unwarranted on the evidence, upon the fact of the girl\u2019s menstruation shortly before the time of the acts charged, and failed to direct their attention to its possible significance (as bearing on the appellant\u2019s defence that he was never aware of the girl\u2019s pregnancy) and also to the motives, consistent with innocence which might have actuated the girl in consulting one W., a physician and surgeon, rather than the family physician, and in presenting herself to him under an assumed married name.\nMisdirection in a material matter having been shown, the onus was upon the Crown to satisfy the court that the jury, charged as it should have been, could not, as reasonable men, have done otherwise than find the appellant guilty (Gouin v. The King, [1926] S.C.R. 539, at p. 543; Allen v. The King, 44 Can. S.C.R. 331, at p. 339; Makin v. Att. Gen. for New South Wales, [1894] A.C. 57, at p. 70). That onus was not discharged.\nAPPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] which, by a majority, dismissed his appeal from his conviction, upon trial by Logie J. and a jury, on the charge of using means to procure abortion, contrary to s. 303 of the Criminal Code.\nBy the judgment now reported, the appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered, on the ground of misdirection in the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury in certain respects indicated in the judgment. I.F. Hellmuth K.C. and R.H. Greer K.C. for the appellant.\nE. Bayly K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE COURT.\u2014A majority of the Court is of the opinion that, in view of the unfortunate failure of the learned trial judge to present to the jury the principal ground of defence put forward by the appellant, his conviction cannot be sustained. As there is to be a new trial, it is inadvisable to discuss the evidence in detail or to do more than indicate what is regarded as the fatal defect in the charge.\nThe appellant is shewn by the evidence to have been more or less connected with two occasions on which the girl, Ruth Dembner, was \u201ctreated\u201d by Dr. Withrow. He accompanied her to the doctor\u2019s residence on the evening of Tuesday the 8th of February, 1927, when the doctor states that he made a physical examination, using a \u201cdilator.\u201d The appellant also brought the girl to the Strathcona Hospital on the night of Friday, the 11th of February, and she was admittedly operated on by Dr. Withrow on the following (Saturday) morning.\nThat Ruth Dembner was in fact pregnant from some time in January is clearly established; and that she was in fact operated on by Dr. Withrow with intent to bring about an abortion is not open to question here.\nThe defence of the appellant is that he was never aware of Ruth Dembner\u2019s pregnancy. There is no direct testimony that he ever learned that fact, circumstantial evidence being relied upon by the Crown to justify an inference of such knowledge. The appellant, on the other hand, points to his knowledge that the girl had menstruated on the 28th of January (deposed to by his father) as importing ignorance by him of the vital fact that she had conceived. The fact of her menstruation is established by the uncontradicted testimony of her mother and sister, called as crown witnesses, and whose credibility is unimpeached. The medical testimony is that menstruation during pregnancy is not uncommon.\nThe fair inference from these facts, it is argued for the appellant, is that both he and the girl did not believe that she was pregnant when she first visited Dr. Withrow on the evening of the 8th of February. At all events, the fact of the menstruation and the significance attached to it by the appellant should have been placed before the jury by the learned trial judge in his charge at least as fairly and as clearly as were the circumstances relied on by the Crown as implying guilty knowledge and intent. Yet, while some emphasis was laid in the charge on the facts that Ruth Dembner had passed over her family physician and had gone to Dr. Withrow, an utter stranger, to be treated, as the defence claims, for dysmenorrhoea, and that she had given her name to Dr. Withrow as \u201cMrs. Brooks,\u201d nothing was said of the suggested explanation offered for the appellant that she probably wished to conceal the loss of her virginity from the family physician and that, as that fact would be apparent to Dr. Withrow, she might have thought it would be more convenient for her to give the name of a married woman.\nThe learned judge, instead of telling the jury, as the evidence clearly warranted, that they should accept as undisputed the girl\u2019s menstruation in the end of January, cast doubt upon that fact, saying: \u201cThe evidence, if any, was of menstruation,\u201d and then, suggesting the possibility of the issue of blood on the 28th of January having been due to some earlier unlawful operation (of which there is not a scintilla of evidence), he added:\nThe weight of that evidence (as to menstruation); the credibility of it is for you; you are the judges of that.\nAfter the jury had retired, counsel for the appellant objected to the charge in these terms:\nIn charging the jury as to the evidence of menstruation I was struck by the fact that you brushed it aside; you covered it in such a way that you in effect used this expression in regard to that; you must consider the weight of the evidence. You did not perhaps have present in your mind at that time that the evidence consisted of the mother\u2019s testimony and the sister\u2019s testimony.\nInstead of recalling the jury and specifically directing their attention to this matter as requested, the learned judge said:\nBut that was impressed upon the jury again and again by you and Mr. Roebuck. Of course there was evidence that blood had been seen on a pad, but all the girl said to her mother was\u2014\u201dIt is the usual.\u201d\nMr. GREER: I have it down that the mother actually saw it.\nHIS LORDSHIP: It may be so but I do not think any miscarriage will occur from that, because counsel reiterated that only this morning to the jury.\nMr. GREER: Well you charged very carefully, and it struck me that perhaps a proper sense of proportion\u2026\nHIS LORDSHIP: Any objection, Mr. Roebuck?\nMr. ROEBUCK: I intend to make none. And yet the learned judge had, early in his charge to the jury, said:\nIt is my duty, gentlemen, to lay the defence fairly and completely before the jury, and I will do that a little later * * *\nTo avoid any possible misapprehension, it should be stated that, in the opinion of the Court, but for the defects in the charge the appellant could not have successfully attacked his conviction. There was quite enough evidence to warrant the jury upon an adequate charge, had they seen fit to do so, drawing the inference of guilty knowledge and intention on his part. But it is impossible to gauge the effect on the jury\u2019s mind of casting doubt upon the fact of the girl\u2019s menstruation and of failing to direct their attention to its possible significance and also to the motives, consistent with innocence, which might have actuated the girl in consulting Dr. Withrow rather than the family physician and in presenting herself to him as \u201cMrs. Brooks.\u201d If the jury, properly instructed as to these points, regarded the first visit to Dr. Withrow on the 8th of February as made for an innocent purpose and in ignorance by the girl and the appellant of her pregnancy, as the Deputy Attorney General admitted they might, they would be obliged to infer from what subsequently occurred that the appellant\u2019s state of mind and his intention changed and that when he brought the girl to the hospital on the Friday evening (February 11) he did so with the object of furthering a design on her part to undergo an operation to procure an abortion. That it may seem probable to an appellate court perusing the record that the jury would have reached that conclusion, does not warrant affirming the conviction. That would, in effect, be to substitute the verdict of the court for that of a jury properly instructed, to which the appellant was entitled. Misdirection in a material matter having been shewn, the onus was upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that the jury, charged as it should have been, could not, as reasonable men, have done otherwise than find the appellant guilty. Gouin v. The King[2]; Allen v. The King[3]; Makin v. Att. Gen. for New South Wales[4]. That burden the Crown, in the view of the majority of the Court, has not discharged. There was non-direction by the learned trial judge in a vital matter, tantamount in the circumstances of this case to misdirection, and constituting a miscarriage of justice within subs. 1 (c) of s. 1014 of the Criminal Code. Upon the whole case, and taking into consideration the entire charge, the majority of the Court, with respect, finds itself unable to accept the view expressed by the learned judge who delivered the majority judgment in the Appellate Division that \u201cno substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice can have occurred\u201d at the trial (Criminal Code, s. 1014 (2)).\nAppeal allowed, conviction set aside and new trial ordered.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smith, Rae & Greer.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Edward Bayly, Deputy Attorney-General for the Province of Ontario.\n[1] (1927) 61 Ont.

Act, s. 93 (1)\u2014Validity of Ontario Statutes and regulations\u2014Taxation for support of continuation schools, collegiate institutes and high schools\u2014Rights of separate schools as to share in legislative grants. The suppliants claimed: (1) The right to establish and conduct courses of study and grades of education in Roman Catholic separate schools in Ontario such as are conducted in continuation schools, collegiate institutes and high schools; and that all regulations purporting to prohibit, limit, or in any way prejudicially affect such right are ultra vires; (2) The right of Roman Catholics in Ontario to exemption from taxation for the support of continuation schools, collegiate institutes and high schools not conducted by their own boards of trustees; (3) A share in public moneys granted by the Ontario legislature for common school purposes computed in accordance with what they asserted to have been their statutory rights at the date of Confederation; and asked for a declaration that certain Ontario statutory enactments prejudicially affected their rights as granted by the Separate Schools Act, 26 Vic. (1863), c. 5, and secured by s. 93 of the B.N.A. Act, and, in so far as they affected such rights, were ultra vires. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario (60 Ont. L.R. 15), affirming judgment of Rose J. (59 Ont. L.R. 96), held against their claims. On appeal to this Court, three of the six judges hearing the appeal held it should be dismissed, and it was dismissed accordingly. Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret J. held in the suppliants\u2019 favour on all said claims. Mignault J. held in their favour except, in part, as to their claim in regard to legislative grants. Duff, Newcombe and Lamont JJ. held against them on all claims. As to a certain sum sued for, the Court unanimously held that the appeal failed.\nThe Separate Schools Act, 26 Vic. (1863), c. 5; the Common Schools Act, C.S.U.C. 1859, c. 64; the B.N.A. Act, s. 93; and other statutes, and official reports and documents, extensively reviewed and discussed.\nPer Anglin C.J.C., Mignault and Rinfret JJ.: Any statute or regulation that would materially diminish or curtail the scope of the education which denominational schools were, at Confederation, legally entitled to impart, or that would tend to restrict the period during which supporters of such schools were then legally entitled to have their children\u2019s education subject to the influence of denominational control and instruction, would \u201cprejudicially affect a right or privilege with respect to denominational schools\u201d within s. 93 (1) of the B.N.A. Act. The remedy is to invoke the ordinary tribunals; the right of appeal to the federal executive under s. 93 (3) does not apply. S. 93 (3) has to do with acts of provincial authorities which, although not ultra vires, so affect rights and privileges theretofore enjoyed by a religious minority as to constitute, in the opinion of the Governor in Council, a grievance calling for federal intervention (Brophy v. Att. Gen. of Manitoba [1895] A.C. 202).\nThe effect of the legislation in force at Confederation, construing it without the aid of any extraneous evidence, was to confer on all separate school trustees, as part of, or incident to, the management and control of the schools entrusted to them, the right to determine the subjects of instruction in, and the grading of, such schools. They had the legal right to provide therein for secondary education. Curtailment of such rights was not within the regulative powers of the Council of Public Instruction. The above view as to the effect of the legislation is prima facie supported by the fact that it was the view accepted and acted upon by the educational authorities, as indicated by the official reports and documents in evidence. (Clyde Navigation Trustees v. Laird, 8 App. Cas. 658, at p. 670). By virtue of the exemption to separate school supporters under s. 14 of the Separate Schools Act of 1863, and from the fact that the Ontario continuation schools, high schools and collegiate institutes are now doing work which formed part of that formerly legally done, or which might have been so done, by the common schools, it follows that separate school supporters are entitled to exemption from rates for the support of such continuation schools, etc. To compel Catholic separate school supporters to support the last-mentioned schools, and to use them, if they would give their children up to 21 years of age a secondary education, is prejudicially to affect the right or privilege enjoyed by Roman Catholics as a class at the Union of having such education given to their children under denominational influence and in separate schools managed by their own trustees (Barrett v. Winnipeg, 19 Can. S.C.R. 374, at p. 424, referred to).\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret J.: Every Ontario legislative enactment involving a departure from the principle of apportionment between common and separate schools pro rata on the basis of average attendance, as provided by s. 20 of the Separate Schools Act of 1863, of all legislative and municipal grants of public moneys for any purpose that was, under the law at Confederation, a common school purpose, (saving grants to high schools in continuation of former grammar school appropriations), would, if valid, prejudicially affect a right or privilege with respect to their denominational schools which Roman Catholics had by law at the Union and is, therefore, ultra vires. Every grant for a common school purpose, whether made for a particular school or schools, or made subject to some restrictive term or condition, is covered by s. 20 of the Separate Schools Act, 1863, and therefore comes within the ambit of the protection of s. 93 (1) of the B.N.A. Act, and cannot be made so as to preclude the right of separate schools to share therein unless compensation to them for their proportion thereof is otherwise provided. The Common and the Separate Schools Acts alike were continued in force after the Union by s. 129 of the B.N.A. Act as provincial legislation of Ontario, subject to repeal and amendment by the legislature, as to common schools without restriction, and as to separate schools within the limitations imposed by s. 93 (1) of the B.N.A. Act (Dobie v. The Church Temporalities Board, 7 App. Cas. 136, at p. 147; Att. Gen. for Ontario v. Att. Gen. for Canada, [1896] A.C. 348, at pp. 336-7). The presence of the words \u201cthis Province\u201d and \u201cthe Province\u201d in s. 20 of the Separate Schools Act of 1863 did not render that provision inapplicable after Confederation. Those terms meant after Confederation the new province of Ontario. The words \u201cand not otherwise appropriated by law,\u201d appended in s. 106 of the Common Schools Act, C.S.U.C. 1859, c. 64, to the description of the legislative grants to be apportioned, do not present a formidable difficulty. S. 20 of the Act of 1863 is subsequent legislation, and, so far as there may be inconsistency, its terms must prevail over those of s. 106 of the Act of 1859. S. 20 of the Act of 1863 precludes an appropriation by law of any grants made for common school purposes which would prevent the separate schools sharing proportionately in them.\nQuaere, whether the legislature could validly formulate a scheme or impose conditions for the distribution amongst the separate schools themselves, other than on the basis of average attendance, of the proportion of the total grants for common school purposes, as under- stood at Confederation, to which the separate schools as a whole are entitled.\nPer Duff and Newcombe JJ.: Under the legislation existing at Confederation, Roman Catholic separate schools were subject to regulation by the Council of Public Instruction for Upper Canada. Giving their natural sense to the words of s. 26 of the Separate Schools Act of 1863, the Council had a general power of regulation. This power would be subject only to relevant enactments of the separate school law and to the limitations necessarily implied in the fact that the power was given for the purpose of enabling Roman Catholics to carry on more satisfactorily their system of denominational schools. Subject as aforesaid, there is no good reason for restricting the natural sense of the words of s. 26. Another possible view is that s. 26 subordinated separate schools to regulation by the Council in respect of all subject matters which might from time to time fall within the ambit of its jurisdiction in relation to common schools, under the existing Common School Acts or subsequent amending legislation. In any case, and even assuming (but not accepting) that the Council\u2019s regulative powers as to separate schools could be taken as confined to the subject matters which were within the field of its authority in relation to common schools at the date of the passing of the Separate Schools Act of 1863, those powers (even if so confined as last mentioned) covered regulation as to scope and conduct of instruction, including courses of study and text-books. Not only does this appear on a proper construction of the common school legislation itself, but it was the view which, as shown by the documents in evidence, dictated the practice of the Council in exercising its functions under the Common School Acts of 1850 and 1859, in which practice, carried out under circumstances of the greatest publicity, the legislature, in view of its re-enactments without pertinent change in the Act of 1859, and the unqualified language of ss. 26 and 9 of the Act of 1863, must be presumed to have acquiesced.\nIn scope of instruction common schools or Roman Catholic separate schools were not, at Confederation, on the same footing as collegiate institutes, high schools or continuation schools to-day. Viewing the school legislation as a whole as it stood at Confederation, its history, and the official acts of those charged with administration of the school law, as shown by official documents in evidence and having regard especially to the required qualifications of teachers, the provision made for training them, the programs of studies officially promulgated, and the character of the authorized text-books, it is plain that such schools were intended to be elementary schools only.\nThe principle of division laid down by s. 20 of the Separate Schools Act of 1863 assumed the existence of a fund which had been appropriated for the benefit of the common schools generally in each municipality. It was upon this fund, so appropriated for a given municipality, that the section operated; it operated only after the fund for each municipality had been ascertained under the distribution provided for in ss. 106, 120, 121 and 122 of the Common Schools Act of 1859. The legislature did not intend to tie its hands by s. 106 (1) of the Act of 1859 in such a way as to necessitate the apportionment of all moneys voted for common schools, according to a fixed arithmetical ratio. The qualification \u201cnot otherwise expressly appro- priated\u201d sufficiently manifests its intention to reserve its freedom of action. Assuming s. 20 to have created a legal \u201cright or privilege\u201d within s. 93 (1) of the B.N.A. Act, it was not a right \u201cby law\u201d to require the legislature to refrain from granting appropriations for special purposes or for the aid of schools reaching a certain standard of excellence or of school sections conforming to a certain standard of expenditure. There has been no deprivation of anything to which any \u201cright or privilege\u201d under s. 20 or under s. 20 combined with s. 106 could attach. Nor is there any evidence that the alleged right or privilege has been rendered less valuable by the impeached legislation (assuming that to be a legitimate ground of complaint under s. 93 (1)). There is no reason for supposing that the existing grants, if distributed according to the arithmetical ratios of ss. 106 and 20, would yield a larger sum for Roman Catholics as a whole. But, more important still, it is impossible to know, if under compulsion of a constitutional limitation the legislature were obliged to follow an unwise and wasteful plan of distribution, whether the grants would be as generous as they now are. There is no suggestion that by the statutes now in force Roman Catholics are placed upon a footing of inequality with the public schools. Grants are shared by all schools alike, upon identical conditions.\nQuaere as to suppliants\u2019 right by petition of right to obtain a declaration that certain Ontario statutes are ultra vires.\nPer Mignault J.: The legislative grant which the Chief Superintendent was to apportion under s. 106 (1) of the Common Schools Act of 1859, and of which he subsequently was to pay a share to the trustees of each separate school, was a general grant for the support of common schools or for common school purposes. A special grant, say for the rebuilding of a particular school destroyed by fire, would be \u201cotherwise appropriated by law,\u201d and he could not deal with it in his apportionment. Such special grants could not be said to be grants \u201cfor common school purposes\u201d within the meaning of s. 20 of the Separate Schools Act of 1863.\nConditions in excess of those laid down by s. 20 cannot be imposed on the separate schools to entitle them to share in the grants to which it applies. Any statute purporting to impose such conditions, as well as all statutes and regulations contravening the suppliants\u2019 first two claims, are ultra vires.\nPer Newcombe J.: The powers of regulation which, within the scope of the Acts of 1859 and 1863, the province possessed at the Union were not reduced by the B.N.A. Act. The denominational schools to which s. 93 (1) refers, so far as they were Roman Catholic separate schools of Upper Canada, were regulated schools, and the provisions to which the suppliants object are within the powers of regulation which the province had in 1863, and continued to possess at and after the Union.\nThere is nothing in the B.N.A. Act to compel the legislature to make a grant, or to avoid conditions prescribed for earning it, or to prevent a specific appropriation.\nPer Lamont J.: At Confederation the Council of Public Instruction had authority to make regulations, including the prescribing of the courses of study, for the common and separate schools. This appears on the proper construction of the Separate Schools Act of 1863 and the Common Schools Act of 1859, from the history of the legislation, and from the accepted practice carried on. It was the trustees\u2019 right to manage their separate schools subject to the Council\u2019s said regulative powers, that was confirmed by s. 93 (1) of the B.N.A. Act. The Council\u2019s powers would not enable it to make regulations which would wipe out, wholly or partially, the common or the separate schools. The common schools, at Confederation, had a distinct and definite place in the educational system of Upper Canada. They were intended to be the primary schools, furnishing elementary instruction, with the grammar schools as intermediate between them and the University; and the Council\u2019s duty was to make regulations prescribing courses of study which would enable the schools to provide effectively instruction covering the field which the legislature intended they should occupy. The separate schools, as to secular education, were intended to be simply common schools under denominational management, and covered the same field as the common schools. The line of demarcation between the primary and intermediate schools may not always have been definitely drawn or closely adhered to; there may have been some overlapping in instruction, due to the exigencies of particular localities; but the legislature\u2019s intention as disclosed in the various Acts, and not the manner in which the system worked out in actual practice, should be the guide in determining the sphere of operation. It cannot be said that, under the impeached legislation, the separate schools of to-day have lost their status as primary schools of the class to which the Act of 1863 intended them to belong.\nThe \u201cpublic grants * * * for common school purposes\u201d in which, under s. 20 of the Act of 1863, every separate school was entitled to share, were general or unconditional grants in which all schools were to share. They did not include moneys appropriated by the legislature to specific purposes, or to grants for apportionment among schools attaining a certain standard of efficiency or equipment, or made payable upon the performance of a condition. \u201cGrants * * * for common school purposes\u201d meant \u201cgrants for the purposes of all common schools.\u201d These would include conditional grants for the same purpose once the condition had been performed. But, as the legislature\u2019s authority to say whether or not any grant at all shall be made, or to specify the conditions upon which public moneys shall be devoted to school purposes, is supreme, the only limitation imposed by s. 20 upon the legislature\u2019s exercise of its authority, so far as conditional grants are concerned, is that the separate schools must be given the same right as the common (now public) schools, to perform the conditions and earn the grant.\nAPPEAL (by leave of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario) from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] dismissing the suppliants\u2019 appeal from the judgment of Rose J.[2] dismissing the petition of right. The original suppliant was the board of trustees of the Roman Catholic separate schools for school section no. 2 in the township of Tiny, on behalf of itself and all other boards of trustees of Roman Catholic separate schools in Ontario. At the hearing in the Appellate Division leave was given to the original suppliant to add as a party suppliant the board of trustees of the Roman Catholic separate schools for the city of Peterborough, an urban board, the latter\u2019s consent being filed; the petition of right and statement of defence were amended; and the fiat of the Lieutenant-Governor was granted to the amended petition.\nThe petition of right (as amended) set out, in effect, as follows:\n1. Each of the suppliants is a body corporate under and by virtue of \u201cThe Separate Schools Act,\u201d R.S.O. 1914, c. 270, s. 21, ss. 3, and as such conducts a Roman Catholic separate school.\n2. Under and by virtue of s. 20 of 26 Vic. (1863), c. 5, being an Act of the then Parliament of Canada entitled \u201cAn Act to restore to Roman Catholics in Upper Canada certain rights in respect to Separate Schools\u201d each of the suppliants is entitled to receive from and be paid by the respondent a share in the fund annually granted by the Legislature of Ontario for the support of common schools and is entitled also to a share in all other public grants investments and allotments for common school purposes then made or thereafter to be made by the province according to the average number of pupils attending such school during the twelve next preceding months, as compared with the whole average number of pupils attending school in the township of Tiny, and in the city of Peterborough respectively.\n3. (Said s. 20 of 26 Vic. c. 5 is set out).\n4. (S. 22 of 26 Vic. c. 5 is set out).\n5. (S. 106 (1) of c. 64 of C.S.U.C., 1859, an Act entitled \u201cThe Upper Canada Common School Act\u201d is set out).\n6. That this Act of 1859 including s. 106 was in full force and effect in the year 1863 and in the year 1867 and continued to be the law applicable to the matters referred to therein for several years subsequent to 1867; and the grants annually made by the Legislature were so apportioned down to and including the year 1907.\n7. (S. 93 (1) of the B.N.A. Act is set out).\n8. That the right of each of the suppliants under and by virtue of the Act of 1863, c. 5, ss. 20 and 23 thereof, and further secured to it by the B.N.A. Act, 1867, c. 5, s. 93, (1), to a share in the fund annually granted by the Legislature of Ontario according to the average number of pupils attending its school as compared with the whole average number of pupils attending school in the said township of Tiny and in the said city of Peterborough respectively was prejudicially affected by the following Acts of the Legislature of Ontario:\n(a) 6 Edward VII (1906), chapter 52\u2014The Department of Education Act, section 23.\n(b) 7 Edward VII (1907), chapter 50, an Act entitled \u201cAn Act to amend the Department of Education Act,\u201d section 4, subsection 3.\n(c) 9 Edward VII (1909), chapter 88, an Act entitled \u201cThe Department of Education Act,\u201d section 6.\n(d) 10 Edward VII (1910), chapter 102, section 1.\n(e) R.S.O. 1914, chapter 265, section 6\u2014an Act entitled \u201cThe Department of Education Act.\u201d\n(f) 12-13 George V (1922), chapter 98, sections 2 and 3\u2014an Act entitled \u201cThe School Law Amendment Act, 1922.\u201d\n(g) 14 George V (1924) chapter 82, section 2\u2014an Act entitled \u201cThe School Law Amendment Act, 1924.\u201d\n9. That so far as the said Acts purport to enact a different method for apportioning the share of the fund annually granted for common school purposes to which the separate schools conducted by the suppliants are or may be entitled other than the average attendance basis as enacted in the Separate School Act of 1863, c. 5, and such different method results or may result in a smaller share of said annual fund being paid to the suppliants than would be payable on the basis of average attendance of pupils, the said Acts are ultra vires of the Legislature of Ontario. 10. That in and for the year 1922, out of the fund granted by the Legislature of Ontario for common school purposes for the year 1922 there was paid to the various school boards or schools in Ontario, according to the report for the year 1923 of the Minister of Education, the amount of $3,401,818 under various titles as follows:\n(1) To Public and Separate Schools (p. 87 of report).\n$2,976,712 00\n(2) To Continuation Schools (p. 90 of report).\n148,217 00\n(3) To Collegiate Institutes and High Schools (p. 91 of report).\n276,889 00\n$3,401,818 00\n11. That the said total sum of $3,401,818 was a fund granted by the Legislature for the support of common schools and for common school purposes within the meaning of s. 20 of 26 Vic. (1863), c. 5, and that the schools conducted by the suppliants were entitled to share in such fund according to the provisions of said Act, 26 Vic. (1863), c. 5.\n12. That as to continuation schools and collegiate institutes and high schools above referred to in par. 10, the same are common schools within the meaning of c. 64 of C.S.U.C., 1859\u2014an Act entitled \u201cThe Upper Canada Common School Act\u201d and of c. 5 of 26 Vic. 1863\u2014an Act entitled \u201cAn Act to restore to Roman Catholics in Upper Canada certain rights in respect to Separate Schools.\u201d\n13. That under and by virtue of the Act of 26 Vic. (1863), c. 5, s. 14, and of the B.N.A. Act of 1867, c. 3, s. 93 (1), the class of persons being separate school supporters represented by the suppliants are exempted from payment of all rates imposed for the support of common schools, and that it is ultra vires of the Legislature of Ontario to impose or attempt to impose upon such persons payment of rates for the support of common schools now known and designated as either continuation schools, collegiate institutes or high schools and which are not established and conducted by the suppliants.\n14. That in so far as the Act of 34, Vic. (1870-1871), c. 33, entitled \u201can Act to improve the Common and Gram- mar Schools of the Province of Ontario\u201d, and subsequent Acts respecting high schools, including c. 268 of R.S.O., 1914, ss. 33, 34, 37, 38 and 39, an Act entitled \u201cThe High Schools Act,\u201d purport to impose upon the class of persons being separate school supporters represented by the suppliants payment of rates for the support of high schools and collegiate institutes not established and conducted by the suppliants, the same are ultra vires of the Legislature of Ontario.\n15. That each of the suppliants is, and in any event the board of trustees of Roman Catholic separate schools in every city, town and village in Ontario is entitled as of right to establish and conduct in its separate schools the courses of study and grades of education that are carried on in such so-called continuation schools and collegiate institutes and high schools, and the fact is such courses of study and grades were established and conducted by certain boards of trustees of the Roman Catholic separate schools from in or about the year 1841 up to and including the year 1915 when certain regulations were enacted by the respondent under which the respondent claimed and still claims the right to limit the range and grade of the courses of study and grades of education, all of which said regulations are in derogation of the rights of the suppliants and are invalid and ultra vires.\n16. That the respondent has no right nor authority as claimed to limit or confine the common school courses of study or grades of education which may be established and carried on by either of the suppliants in the schools conducted by the suppliants respectively.\n17. That according to the last census of Ontario made in 1921, the population of the province as of the year 1921 was 2,933,622 persons, and according to the same census the population of the township of Tiny for the year 1921 was 4,026 persons.\n18. That the share of the fund mentioned in par. 10 which should have been allotted to the common schools of the said township of Tiny on the basis of the proportion of the population of the said township as compared with the total population of the province was $4,669.00.\n19. That the average attendance of the common schools including both common public schools and common sep- arate schools of the said township of Tiny for the year 1922 was 629 pupils, and the average attendance for the same period of pupils of Roman Catholic school section no. 2 of the said township, being the school conducted by one of the suppliants, was 159 pupils.\n20. That under and by virtue of the right granted the suppliants by the Act of 1863, s. 20, the suppliant, the board of trustees of the Roman Catholic separate school for school section no. 2, township of Tiny, was entitled in and for the year 1922 to such a share of the said sum of $4,669 mentioned in par. 18 as the average number of pupils attending the suppliant\u2019s school, namely,159 pupils, compared with the whole average number of pupils attending school in the said township of Tiny, namely, 629 pupils;\n21. That by reason of the facts referred to in par. no. 20 the said suppliant was entitled as of right to be paid the amount of $1,116 out of the said sum of $4,669.\n22. The said suppliant was unlawfully held to be entitled only to and was paid the amount of $380 only out of the said sum of $4,669 and thereby suffered for the year 1922, a pecuniary loss of $736.\n23. If, notwithstanding said suppliant\u2019s submission and contention as set out above, it should be held that it is not entitled to a share of the sums of $148,217 and $276,889 paid respectively to continuation schools and collegiate institutes and high schools as set out in par. 10, but is entitled only to its proportion of the sum of $2,976,712 also referred to in said par. 10 (which said suppliant does not admit but denies), then, and in such event, the said suppliant submits that on the said basis of average attendance as referred to in par. 19 it was entitled to receive from and be paid by the respondent for the said year 1922 the sum of $1,027 instead of only the said sum of $380, whereby it suffered a pecuniary loss for the year 1922 of $647.\nThe suppliants therefore pray:\n(1) That there be paid the sum of $736 to the board of trustees of the Roman Catholic separate schools for school section no. 2, township of Tiny.\n(2) That it may be declared that the Acts or parts of Acts following: (a) Sections 36 (subsection 1) and 40 of 34 Victoria (1870-1871) chapter 33\u2014an Act entitled \u201cAn Act to improve the Common and Grammar Schools of the Province of Ontario.\u201d\n(b) Section 23, subsection 6, of 6 Edward VII (1906), chapter 52\u2014an Act entitled \u201cThe Department of Education Act.\u201d\n(c) Section 4, subsection 3 and 4, of 7 Edward VII (1907), chapter 50\u2014an Act entitled \u201cAn Act to amend the Department of Education Act.\u201d\n(d) Section 6 of 9 Edward VII (1909), chapter 88\u2014an Act entitled \u201cThe Department of Education Act.\u201d\n(e) Section 1 of 10 Edward VII (1910), chapter 102\u2014an Act entitled \u201cAn Act to amend the Department of Education Act.\u201d\n(f) Section 6 of chapter 265 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1914\u2014an Act entitled \u201cThe Department of Education Act.\u201d\n(g) Sections 33, 34, 37, 38 and 39 of chapter 268 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario (1914) and amendments thereto\u2014an Act entitled \u201cThe High Schools Act.\u201d\n(h) Sections 2 and 3 of 12-13 George V (1922), chapter 98, an Act entitled \u201cThe School Law Amendment Act, 1922.\u201d\n(i) Section 2 of 14 George V (1924), chapter 82\u2014an Act entitled \u201cThe School Law Amendment Act, 1924.\u201d\nprejudicially affect the suppliants\u2019 rights as granted by 26 Vic.

He admits the allegations contained in par. 1 of the Petition of Right, but except as hereinafter expressly admitted denies all other allegations in the Petition of Right contained and puts the suppliants to the proof thereof.\n2. He denies that any right of either of the suppliants within the meaning of s. 93 of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, as claimed in par. 8 of the Petition of Right, has been, or is, prejudicially affected by any of the several Acts of the Legislature of Ontario as in the said par. 8 alleged.\n3. He denies that any of the said Acts in said par. 8 prejudicially affects any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons had by law in the said Province on 1st July, 1867, when the B.N.A. Act, 1867, went into effect (hereinafter referred to as \u201cat the Union\u201d) within the meaning of s. 93 of the said B.N.A. Act, or that any of the said Acts or any part thereof is ultra vires the Legislature of the Province as alleged in par. 9 of the Petition of Right.\n4. By a series of legislative acts from 1843 to 1863 inclusive, the law relating to the establishment, maintenance, regulation and control of common schools, including separate schools, in Upper Canada was from time to time altered; and at the Union the law governing the establishment, maintenance, regulation and control of Roman Catholic separate schools was contained in an Act of the Parliament of Canada passed in 1863 (26 Vic., Canada, c. 5) and in an Act of the said Parliament entitled \u201cThe Upper Canada Common School Act\u201d (C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 64) together with the Regulations in force made pursuant to the last-named Act.\n5. In and by the said Act of 1863 relating to Roman Catholic separate schools, which recites that it is just and proper to bring the provisions of the law respecting separate schools more in harmony with the provisions of the law respecting common schools, it was, among other provisions for that purpose enacted that:\n(a) The trustees of separate schools should perform the same duties and be subject to the same penalties as trustees of common schools (s. 9);\n(b) The teachers of separate schools should be subject to the same examinations and receive their certificates of qualification in the same manner as common school teachers generally (s. 13);\n(c) All judges, members of the Legislature, the heads of the municipal bodies in their respective localities, the Chief Superintendent and Local Superintendent of common schools and clergymen of the Roman Catholic Church, should be visitors of separate schools (s. 23); and\u2014\n(d) The Roman Catholic separate schools (with their registers) should be subject to such inspection as may be directed from time to time by the Chief Superintendent of Education, and should be subject also to such regulations as may be imposed from time to time by the Council of Public Instruction for Upper Canada (s. 26).\n6. The duties and penalties of trustees of separate schools, the qualification of teachers, and the rights and obligations of supporters of Roman Catholic separate schools in respect of the general conduct, management and control of the said separate schools, were determined and prescribed at the Union by the said \u201cThe Upper Canada Common School Act\u201d (C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 64) and by the Regulations made and imposed in pursuance thereof by the Council of Public Instruction for Upper Canada then in force. 7. The only distinction in the law governing common schools in general at the Union and that governing the Roman Catholic separate schools related to religious instruction. In all other respects the law and regulations were the same. Any part of a legislative grant to which any school would otherwise be entitled which was not earned or was forfeited because the school was not conducted according to the School Law and Regulations remained the property of the Province.\n8. In 1896 the functions formerly vested in the Council of Public Instruction and in the Chief Superintendent of Education were suspended by an Act of the Legislature of Ontario (39 Vic. 16) and vested in a Department of the Provincial Government called the Department of Education and the Minister of Education of the said Province respectively.\n9. Subject to the limitation provided by s. 93 of the B.N.A. Act, the Legislature of Ontario may exclusively make laws in relation to education, and the several Acts referred to in the Petition of Right and alleged by the suppliants to be ultra vires of the Legislature are amendments to the school law made from time to time in the interests of primary education in the Province.\n10. All of the said Acts are within the competence of the Province and none of the said grants authorized by or made pursuant to any of the said Acts mentioned in par. 8 of the Petition of Right are legislative grants within the meaning of s. 20 of the Separate Schools Act of Upper Canada of 1863 (26 Vic., c. 5).\n11. He denies that the total sum of $3,401,818 mentioned in pars. 10 and 11 of the Petition of Right was or is a fund granted by the Legislature for the support of common schools and for common school purposes within the meaning of s. 20 of the above-mentioned Act (26 Vic., c. 5) as claimed in par. 11, or that the schools conducted by the suppliants were entitled to share in such fund according to the provisions of the said Act, or that the continuation schools or collegiate institutes or high schools, referred to in par. 10 thereof, are common schools within the meaning of the said Act or of the Upper Canada Common School Act (C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 54) as claimed in par. 12 of the Petition of Right. 12. The high schools of the Province are in substitution for the grammar schools of the late Province of Upper Canada as re-organized and modified by Ontario legislation from time to time. The said grammar schools were not \u201ccommon schools\u201d or schools within the meaning of the Upper Canada Common School Act, but were secondary schools. Collegiate institutes are high schools having a prescribed number of teachers and pupils which, on complying with the Regulations of the Department of Education with respect thereto, may be raised to the rank of a collegiate institute.\n13. Continuation schools, which were inaugurated in Ontario by an Act entitled \u201cAn Act respecting Continuation Schools\u201d (1909, 9 Edward VII, c. 90) are not common schools, within the meaning of either the Upper Canada Common Schools Act or the Act relating to Separate Schools of 1863, but are intermediate schools for secondary education designed to give instruction in the courses of study prescribed for high schools in order to relieve congestion or to provide high school education where not otherwise available.\n14. He denies that under and by virtue of the above-mentioned Act of 1863 (26 Vic., c. 5, s. 14) and of the B.N.A. Act, 1867 (s. 93) the separate school supporters represented by the suppliants are exempted from payment of the rates imposed for the support of common schools or that it is ultra vires of the Legislature of Ontario to impose on such persons payments and rates for the support of continuation schools, collegiate institutes or high schools as alleged and claimed by the suppliants in pars. 13 and 14 of the Petition of Right. He submits that none of the said schools are \u201ccommon schools\u201d within the meaning of s. 14 of the said Act of 1863 (26 Vic., c. 5).\n15. He further denies that either of the suppliants or the boards of trustees of Roman Catholic separate schools (urban) is or are entitled to establish and conduct in separate schools the courses of study and grades of education that are carried on in continuation schools, collegiate institutes and high schools, or any of them, as alleged in par. 15 of the Petition of Right, and also denies that such courses of study and grades of education were ever established by law in connection with Roman Catholic separate schools prior to 1st July, 1867, as in said paragraph alleged.\n16. He submits that the suppliants are not entitled to any of the declarations or other relief as prayed in the Petition of Right and that it should be dismissed.\nI.F. Hellmuth K.C. and T.F. Battle for the appellants.\nW.N. Tilley K.C. and McGregor Young K.C. for the respondent.\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014This proceeding was instituted in order to determine the validity of three claims of \u201cRoman Catholics\u201d in the province of Ontario with respect to Education:\u2014\n(A) Their claim \u201cto establish and conduct courses of study and grades of education in Catholic separate schools such as are now conducted in continuation schools, collegiate institutes and high schools\u201d; and that \u201call regulations purporting to prohibit, limit or in any way prejudicially affect such right or privilege are invalid and ultra vires;\u201d\n(B) Their claim to exemption from taxation for the support of continuation schools, collegiate institutes and high schools not conducted by their own boards of trustees;\n(C) Their claim to a share in public moneys granted by the Legislature of the province of Ontario \u201cfor common school purposes\u201d computed in accordance with what they assert to have been their statutory rights at the date of Confederation.\nAfter a long and somewhat bitter struggle, the Separate Schools Act of 1863 (26 Vic., c. 5) was enacted by the Legislature of the province of Canada. That statute, the appellants maintain, re-established the rights and privileges now in question. It was intituled: \u201cAn Act to restore to the Roman Catholics in Upper Canada certain Rights in respect to Separate Schools,\u201d and remained in force at Confederation. Whatever rights and privileges the Catholics of Upper Canada enjoyed under it in respect to their separate schools were made permanent by s. 93 (1) of the British North America Act, 1867. That section, authoritatively designated a code of legislative jurisdiction on the subject of Education for the older provinces of Canada (Brophy v. Att. Gen. of Manitoba[3]), reads, in part, as follows:\u2014\n93. In and for each Province the Legislature may exclusively make Laws in relation to Education, subject and according to the following Provisions:\u2014\n(1) Nothing in any such Law shall prejudicially affect any Right or Privilege with respect to Denominational Schools which any Class of Persons have by Law in the Province at the Union;\n(2) All the Powers, Privileges, and Duties at the Union by Law conferred and imposed in Upper Canada on the Separate Schools and School Trustees of the Queen\u2019s Roman Catholic Subjects shall be and the same are hereby extended to the Dissentient Schools of the Queen\u2019s Protestant and Roman Catholic Subjects in Quebec;\n(3) Where in any Province a System of Separate or Dissentient Schools exists by Law at the Union or is thereafter established by the Legislature of the Province, an Appeal shall lie to the Governor General in Council from any Act or Decision of any Provincial Authority affecting any Right or Privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic Minority of the Queen\u2019s Subjects in relation to Education * * *\nAs put by Magee J.A., in the present case, the safeguarding provisions of s. 93 \u201cshould be interpreted and effectuated in abounding good faith.\u201d[4] So to construe and apply sub-s. 1 of s. 93 that its manifest purpose shall not be defeated is the function of the courts.\nThe rights and privileges which sub-s. 1 of s. 93 of the B.N.A. Act protects are rights and privileges \u201cwith respect to denominational schools\u201d which \u201cany class of persons have by law in the Province at the Union.\u201d It is well established that the \u201cclass of persons\u201d whose legal rights and privileges are thus safeguarded is to be determined according to religious belief and that \u201cRoman Catholics together\u201d form such a class. As trustees, vested in their representative character with rights and privileges of members of that class, vindication of which is sought in these proceedings, the status of the appellants to maintain their petition of right was conceded at bar. Ottawa S.S. Trustees v. Ottawa Corporation[5]; Ottawa S.S. Trustees v. Mackell[6].\nIt is, no doubt, also abundantly clear that only \u201crights or privileges\u201d which existed \u201cby law\u201d at Confederation are protected by s. 93 (1). The statute expressly so states; and it has been so determined by the highest authority. Maher v. Portland[7].\nAny practice, instruction or privilege of a voluntary character, which, at the date of the passing of the Act, might be in operation\nis not a \u201clegal right or privilege\u201d[8].\nOn the other hand, the \u201crights or privileges\u201d within s. 93 (1) are not only those \u201cin respect to denominational teaching,\u201d as some casual expressions of Lord Buckmaster in the Mackell case[9] might suggest. There is no allusion in the Separate Schools Act of 1863 to religious instruction. There may be an invasion of a \u201cright or privilege with respect to denominational schools\u201d which, although most prejudicial to those schools, does not directly affect them in their \u201cdenominational aspect.\u201d The decision in Ottawa S.S. Trustees v. Ottawa Corporation[10], likewise delivered by Lord Buckmaster, makes this abundantly clear. A statute substituting a commission composed of Catholics, but nominated by the Government, to manage the Ottawa separate schools in lieu of the elected board of trustees was there held ultra vires as prejudicially affecting the right or privilege of the supporters of Catholic separate schools to have them managed by their own elected trustees.\nThe appellants submit that the Provincial Courts have misapprehended the scope and purpose of the Act of 1863 and also the effect upon it of sub-s. 1 of s. 93 of the B.N.A. Act. The view taken below is thus expressed by Hodgins J.A.[11]\nThe rights in respect of denominational schools, generally speaking, were the establishment and conduct of them by and under the immediate supervision of the Church which desired them, either in Quebec or Ontario, subject to regulations made pursuant to statute law. Rights and privileges in such schools, so far as they were \u201cin relation to education\u201d (as carried on by them), if affected, were to be dealt with by the Legislatures of the Provinces, subject to an appeal, not to the Courts, but to Federal authority, which was to correct any infringement of those rights and privileges. These belonged not to a denomination as the creator and guardian of separate schools, but to the schools themselves, as part of a system of education. It was to the Provinces that education was committed and it is right that the systems of education established by them and the rights flowing therefrom, should be governed by their Legislatures and not by the Courts. The appellants point out that there is no reference in the statute of 1863 to \u201cimmediate supervision of the Church\u201d and contend that the view that the redress of separate school supporters against provincial legislation adversely affecting their pre-Confederation legal rights and privileges is confined to an appeal to the federal authority ignores the provisions of sub-s. 1 of s. 93 of the B.N.A. Act. The idea that the denominational school is to be differentiated from the common school purely by the character of its religious exercises or religious studies is erroneous. Common and separate schools are based on fundamentally different conceptions of education. Undenominational schools are based on the idea that the separation of secular from religious education is advantageous. Supporters of denominational schools, on the other hand, maintain that religious instruction and influence should always accompany secular training.\nAny statute or regulation that would materially diminish or curtail the scope of the education which denominational schools were, at the date of Confederation, legally entitled to impart, or that would tend to restrict the period during which supporters of such schools, Catholic or Protestant, were then legally entitled to have the education of their children subject to the influence of denominational control and instruction, would \u201cprejudicially affect a right or privilege with respect to denominational schools\u201d enjoyed by the class of persons of which such supporters form a section. Catholics deem it of vital importance that denominational influence over, and instruction of, their children should continue during the period of their secondary education. Any attempted interference with such educational rights or privileges, whether by statute or by regulation purporting to be made under statutory authority, contravenes sub-s. 1 of s. 93; the remedy is to invoke \u201cthe jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals of the country\u201d; the right of appeal to the federal executive under sub-s. 3 does not apply. This latter subsection has to do with acts of the provincial authorities, which, although not ultra vires, so affect rights and privileges theretofore enjoyed by a religious minority, Protestant or Catholic (it may be under post-Confederation legislation), as to constitute, in the opinion of the Governor in Council, a griev- ance calling for Federal intervention. (Brophy v. Att. Gen. of Manitoba[12]).\nIt would require an Act of the Imperial Legislature prejudicially to affect any right or privilege reserved under provision 1, and if the (statutes or) regulations impeached do prejudicially affect any such right or privilege, to that extent they are not binding on the appellants. The Mackell Case,[13] ubi sup.\nIt was held by Rose J.[14], with the approval of the Appellate Divisional Court, that, because the rights or privileges of the separate schools at Confederation in regard to legislative money grants depended upon legislation of the former province of Canada and such grants were therein (26 Vic., c. 5, s. 20) described as \u201cthe fund annually granted by the Legislature of this Province\u201d and \u201call other public grants, investments and allotments for common school purposes now made, or hereafter to be made by the Province,\u201d the Province of Ontario, newly created in 1867, was unaffected by any obligation in regard thereto and Catholic separate school supporters were not assured of a legal right to share in any appropriations or grants to be made by Ontario for common school purposes. This view is utterly at variance with the spirit and intent of s. 93 (1) of the B.N.A. Act. Unless the legislatures of Ontario and Quebec are debarred from prejudicially affecting the rights and privileges of the respective religious minorities in regard to maintenance and support which their denominational schools enjoyed at Confederation under legislation of the former Province of Canada, the protection of such rights and privileges afforded by sub-s. 1 of s. 93 becomes illusory and the purpose of the Imperial legislation is subverted.\nMoreover, by s. 129 of the B.N.A. Act, the Separate Schools Act of 1863 was continued in force \u201cas if the Union had not been made,\u201d subject only to a power of repeal or alteration \u201caccording to the authority * * * of the Legislature under this Act.\u201d That power of repeal or alteration is, like all other provincial legislative jurisdiction over education, subject to the restriction imposed by sub-s. 1 of s. 93. That the deprivation or diminution of a right to share in financial aid out of public moneys assured by law to their denominational schools at Con- federation would prejudicially affect a privilege of Roman Catholics in regard to those schools seems incontrovertible.\nIt is also urged that inherent in the conception of a legislature is the untrammelled right to make or withhold grants of public moneys and to attach thereto such conditions as it may see fit. That is, no doubt, true of every sovereign Parliament whose powers are unrestricted; it was true of the Legislature of the Province of Canada up to 1867; and it is likewise true since Confederation of a Canadian Provincial Legislature, save as otherwise provided in the B.N.A. Act. But, as Lord Herschell said, speaking for the Judicial Committee, in Brophy v. Att. Gen. of Manitoba[15].\nIt must be remembered that the Provincial Legislature is not in all respects supreme within the province. Its legislative power is strictly limited. * * * In relation to the subjects specified in sect. 92 of the British North America Act, and not falling within those set forth in sect. 91, the exclusive power of the Provincial Legislature may be said to be absolute. But this is not so as regards education, which is separately dealt with and has its own code * * * in the British North America Act. * * * It may be said to be anomalous that such a restriction as that in question should be imposed on the free action of a Legislature, but is it more anomalous than to grant to a minority who are aggrieved by legislation an appeal from the Legislature to the Executive Authority? And yet this right is expressly and beyond all controversy conferred.\nTo impugn the efficacy of a restriction placed by s. 93 of the B.N.A. Act on the control of a provincial legislature over rights in regard to aid out of public moneys for denominational schools existing by law at Confederation would be to challenge the power of the Imperial Parliament, when creating a legislature, to impose on the exercise of one or more of its functions such limitations as, in its discretion, it may deem advisable.\n(A) While the right of the trustees to determine the courses of study in separate schools rests primarily on the duty of management expressly imposed on them, a much discussed issue on this branch of the case was whether, in affording the secondary education undoubtedly imparted, as will presently appear, at and prior to Confederation, by schools established under the Common Schools Act and conducted as common schools (and not improbably in some Catholic separate schools), trustees were exercising powers conferred on them by law, or whether their doing so was merely a practice lacking legal sanction, but tolerated by the educational authorities.\nThe Trustees of a Catholic separate school, under the Act of 1863, were elected\nfor the management of such separate school (s. 3)\nand had (s. 7)\nall the powers in respect of separate schools that the Trustees of Common Schools (had) and (possessed) under the provisions of the Act relating to Common Schools (C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 64);\nand they were required (s. 9) to\nperform the same duties and (were) subject to the same penalties as Trustees of Common Schools.\nThe teachers of separate schools were required to have the same qualifications (s. 13) and were liable to the same obligations as teachers of the common schools (s. 9).\nThe preamble of the Act of 1863 states its purpose to have been\nto restore to Roman Catholics in Upper Canada certain rights which they formerly enjoyed in respect to Separate Schools and to bring the provisions of the Law respecting Separate Schools more in harmony with the provisions of the Law respecting Common Schools.\nIt is, therefore, abundantly clear that, if, in 1867, trustees of common schools in Upper Canada had, by law, the right to provide in their schools for the secondary education now in question, Catholic trustees had, in the management of their separate schools, the same legal right.\nTurning to the Common Schools Act in force in 1867 (C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 64), we find that it contains no limitation upon the scope of the education to be imparted or upon the courses of study to be conducted in the common schools.\nIn rural school sections school trustees were required inter alia (s. 27) to provide school premises; to contract with, employ and pay teachers; to permit all residents between the ages of 5 and 21 to attend their schools (sub-s. 16); to exclude unauthorized text-books; and to report the number of children over 5 years of age and under 16 years of age in the school section and the number of \u201cchildren and young persons\u201d taught (distinguishing the sexes and those over and under 16 years of age), the average attendance, the branches of education taught with the numbers in each branch, and the text-books used. By s. 32 provision was made for the inclusion of all the school sections of a township under a single board of five trustees, who\nshall be invested with the same powers and be subject to the same obligations as Trustees (of schools) in Cities and Towns, by the seventy-ninth section of this Act.\nUrban school trustees were required, inter alia, (s. 79 (8))\nto determine (a) the number, sites, kind and description of schools to be established and maintained in the City, Town, or Village; also (b) the Teacher or Teachers to be employed; the terms of employing them, the amount of their remuneration, and the duties which they are to perform; (and) also (c) the salary of the local Superintendent of Schools appointed by them, and his duties;\n(sub-s. 11) to lay before the municipal councils an estimate of the sums required for purchasing or renting school premises, buildings, sites, etc., and (sub-s. 17) to report as in the case of rural trustees.\nWhile there was no express statement of the ages of children eligible for attendance at urban common schools, the provision of sub-s. 16 of s. 27 conferring a right of attendance on all residents up to 21 years of age, was made applicable by sub-ss. 17 and 18 of s. 79.\nEvery common school teacher employed by the trustees (s. 27 (8)), on terms and for a remuneration and to perform duties to be determined by them (s. 79 (8)), was obliged\nto teach diligently and faithfully all the branches required to be taught in the School according to the terms of his engagement with the Trustees and according to the provisions of this Act (s. 82 (1)).\nThe same obligations were imposed on teachers of separate schools (26 Vic., c. 5, s. 9).\nLocal superintendents were required to see that the common schools were conducted according to law (s. 91 (6)) and to report to the Chief Superintendent (sub-s. 12) the branches taught, the number of pupils in each branch, the text-books used, the average school attendance, etc.\nCounty and Circuit Boards were also provided for and were empowered\nto select (if deemed expedient) from a list of text-books recommended or authorized by the Council of Public Instruction, such books as they may think best adapted for use in the Common Schools of the County or Circuit (s. 98 (3)).\nA Council of Public Instruction, constituted in 1850 (13-14 Vic., c. 48, s. 36), was continued (s. 114) and was empowered, inter alia, (s. 119 (4)) to make such regulations from time to time, as it deems expedient, for the organization, government and discipline of Common Schools, for the classification of Schools and Teachers * * *\nand (sub-s. 5)\nto examine, and at its discretion, recommend or disapprove of text-books for the use of schools. * * *\nIt is noteworthy that these powers were conferred in the Common Schools Act; and sub-s. 4 of s. 119 of that Act appears to have been the only statutory provision giving jurisdiction to the Council of Public Instruction to make regulations affecting common (or separate) schools. The language of sub-s. 4 may be compared with the wider terms in which the Board of Education, the predecessor of the Council of Public Instruction, had been empowered by the statute of 1846 (9 Vic., c. 20, s. 3)\nto make from time to time all needful rules and regulations for the management and good government of such School (s).\nBy s. 26 of the Separate Schools Act of 1863 separate schools were declared to be\nsubject to such regulations, as may be imposed, from time to time, by the Council of Public Instruction for Upper Canada.\nThese regulations were, no doubt, such as the Council of Public Instruction might legally make in exercising the power conferred upon it by s. 119 (4) of the Common Schools Act (the only provision which purports to confer, and define the subjects of, its jurisdiction to regulate), without derogating from the rights of management and control conferred on trustees by the Separate Schools Act. The Separate Schools Act, 1863, contained nothing corresponding to sub-s. 5 of s. 119 of the Common Schools Act which expressly gave supervision over text\u2011books for common schools to the Council of Public Instruction.\nSuch appear to be the relevant statutory provisions on this branch of the appeal.\nThe trustees of all separate schools were elected for their \u201cmanagement.\u201d The trustees of urban common schools were explicitly required to determine the kind and description of schools to be carried on under their charge since 1847 (10-11 Vic., c. 19, s. 5 (3)), when the Legislature appears to have thought it advisable to make some distinct provisions for cities and towns, which were extended to villages in the C.S.U.C. of 1859, c. 64, s. 79 (8). In our opinion the effect of the legislation in force at Confederation, construing it without the aid of any extraneous evi- dence, is that it conferred on all separate school trustees, as part of, or incident to, the management and control of the schools entrusted to them, the right to determine the subjects of instruction in and the grading of such schools. In the cases of urban trustees, and of township boards, constituted under s. 32 of the C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 64, this right is expressly conferred. (C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 64, s. 79 (8); 26 Vic., c. 5, s. 7.)\nThere is, moreover, no doubt, as appears from the following extracts, that this view of the scope of the trustees\u2019 powers and duties was acted upon from 1847 by the provincial authorities. Indeed most of the official statements to be quoted were made after 1850, when the respondent asserts that the duty of school trustees to determine the courses of study and the books to be used in the schools under their charge, imposed by the statutes of 1841 (4-5 Vic., c. 18, s. 7 (4)) and of 1843 (7 Vic., c. 29, s. 44 (7)), was transferred to the Council of Public Instruction under the power to regulate common schools then given to it. (13-14 Vic., c. 48, s.38 (4); C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 64, s.119 (4)). Following a suggestion of their Lordships of the Privy Council in Citizens\u2019 Insurance Co. v. Parsons[16], we make of the official reports and documents in evidence the use indicated by Lord Blackburn in Clyde Navigation Trustees v. Laird[17]. See, too, Assheton Smith v. Owen[18]; Goldsmiths\u2019 Company v. Wyatt[19]; and Dunbar v. Roxburghe[20]. Reference may also be made to Van Diemen\u2019s Land Co. v. Table Cape Marine Board[21], and to some observations of the Lord Chancellor in delivering the report of the Judicial Committee in the recent Labrador Boundary Case[22].\nDr. Egerton Ryerson, from whose reports and official circulars the extracts about to be quoted are taken, had been assistant superintendent prior to 1846 and was chief superintendent of the schools of Upper Canada from that time until 1876. His statutory duties were, inter alia, (C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 64, s. 106) (5) To prepare suitable forms, and to give such instructions as he may judge necessary and proper, for making all reports and conducting all proceedings under this Act, and to cause the same, with such general regulations as may be approved of by the Council of Public Instruction for the better organization and government of Common Schools, to be transmitted to the officers required to execute the provisions of this Act;\n(6) To cause to be printed from time to time, in a convenient form, so many copies of this Act, with the necessary forms, instructions, and regulations to be observed in executing its provisions, as he may deem sufficient for the information of all officers of Common Schools, and to cause the same to be distributed for that purpose;\nDr. Ryerson would appear to have used the Journal of Education, constituted by His Excellency the Governor General in Council for that purpose (Ex. 34, p. 100, n. 4.), as a medium of communication with trustees and teachers.\nIn his report to the Governor for the year 1847, at p. 118 (Journal of Education, 1849, Vol. II), the Chief Superintendent said, referring to conditions existing prior to the legislation of that year (10-11 Vic., c. 19):\u2014\nThe statistics afford a clear but painful proof of the very elementary character of the Common Schools, and the absolute necessity of employing every possible means of elevating it.\nIn enumerating the number of pupils in the different branches, he said that\nthe 1,773 reported as pursuing \u201cother studies\u201d seem to have been pursuing \u201chigher studies,\u201d for under this head in Abstract C will be found 41 Common Schools in which Latin and Greek were taught, 60 in which French was taught, and 77 in which the elements of Natural Philosophy were taught;\nand, citing a New York report shewing the schools of that State to be more advanced in their studies, he proceeded\u2014\nThe introduction of these studies into our Common Schools has been sanctioned by the Legislative department of the Government.\nIn his Circular of 1848, explaining the objects of the Act of 1847 in regard to cities and towns and suggested general regulations, the Chief Superintendent said, at p. 197 (Exhibit 6):\u2014\nThe Board of Trustees will, of course, determine the age at which pupils will be admitted in each kind, or class, of schools, or in each department of a School comprising more than one department; the particular School which pupils in the different localities of a City, or Town, shall attend; the condition of admission and continuance in each School; the subjects of instruction and the text-books to be used in each School, and in each department; * * *\nPage 6, paragraph V of the Chief Superintendent\u2019s report of 1849, dealing with the \u201cClassification of Pupils, and Subjects taught in the Schools\u201d shews that these subjects included: Mensuration, Algebra, Geometry, Elements of Natural Philosophy, Vocal Music, Linear Drawing, and other Studies, such as the Elements of the Latin and Greek Languages, etc. * * * which are taught in some of the Common Schools.\nIn the same report, at p. 14, we are told by the superintendent of common schools for the Simcoe District that in the schools in seven townships (which he names) including the township of Tiny,\nthe teachers are capable of imparting a thorough English, and, in some instances, a good classical education.\nAnd, at p. 50 of the same report, the Chief Superintendent said:\nIt is also worthy of remark, that the Board of Trustees in each city and incorporated town in Upper Canada, has authority to establish Male and Female Primary, Secondary and High Schools, adapted to the varied intellectual wants of each city and town; while in each country School Section, it requires the united means of intelligence of the whole population to establish and support one thoroughly good School.\nAt p. 18 of his report of 1850, the Chief Superintendent said:\nThe board of trustees in each city, town and incorporated village, having the charge of all the schools in such municipality, is able to establish and classify them in such manner as to meet the wants of all ages and classes of youth. This is done by the establishment of primary, intermediate and high schools. In some instances, this system of the classification or gradation of such schools has been commenced by establishing a large central school under the direction of a head master, with assistants, having a primary and intermediate, as well as high school department\u2014the pupils being promoted from one department to another according to their progress and attainments. In other instances the same object is pursued by having one high school and intermediate and primary schools in different buildings and parts of the city or town. These schools can also be male, or female, or mixed, as the board of trustees may judge expedient.\nAt p. 204 the Chief Superintendent repeated the observations already quoted from p. 50 of his report of 1849. At p. 309 of the same report, 1850, (Exhibit 9), speaking of cities, towns and incorporated villages, he said:\nEach Board has the charge of all the Common Schools in the municipality, determines their number and kind, whether primary, intermediate or high schools, whether classical or English, whether denominational or mixed,\nand, at p. 310:\nIn regard to the large central school houses in cities, towns, and villages, after the noble examples of the boards of trustees in Hamilton, London, Brantford, Brockville, and Chatham, etc. * * * It may often be found more economical to bring all grades of schools into one building.\nIn the annual report of 1852, at p. 41, Table B, is given the list of higher subjects taught in the common schools and at p. 43, Table C, the text-books, which include Latin, Greek and Euclid. In 1863 the annual report shews 20,991 pupils over 16 years of age attending the common schools and 12,094 in \u201cother studies\u201d, which, no doubt, included Latin and Greek.\nAs has been already stated, the trustees of separate schools were granted the same powers as trustees of common schools (26 Vic., c. 5, s. 7).\nIn Ottawa Separate Schools Trustees v. Mackell[23], their Lordships of the Judicial Committee, discussing the legal rights and privileges of separate school trustees, say that\nthe \u201ckind\u201d of school referred to in sub-s. 8 of s. 79 (C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 64) is, in their opinion, the grade or character of school * * *\nThe provisions of the Common Schools Act were generally understood to contemplate that, at all events in cities, towns, and villages, and in rural districts where s. 32 of the Act of 1859 applied, the trustees should determine, according to their conception of local educational requirements, the subjects to be taught and the scope of the education to be imparted in the school or schools under their charge and would appear to confer upon them the legal right to do so. It was a statutory duty in 1867 to provide in all common schools education suitable for pupils ranging from 5 to 21 years of age and of both sexes.\nWith the law in the state thus indicated it is not surprising that in many of the larger centres, where higher educational standards were necessary to meet local requirements, common schools, at and prior to Confederation, were carrying on, with the approval and encouragement of the provincial educational authorities, courses in practically all the branches of learning now included in the curricula of high schools as well as public schools and were imparting to their pupils the education requisite to enable them to matriculate into the University, to enter the Normal School, and to take up the studies prescribed for the \u201clearned professions\u201d.\nFrom the official documents in evidence we learn that such secondary education\u2014apparently a complete high school course\u2014was being given before Confederation in the central common schools of the cities of Hamilton and London, that similar courses for girls were recommended for the city of Toronto, and were contemplated for the cities of Kingston and Guelph by the common school trustees of each of those three cities\u2014all with the endorsation and active encouragement of the Chief Superintendent of Education and, presumably, with the knowledge and sanction of the Legislature, to which his annual reports were submitted.\nIn the annual report of 1852 (already referred to) in Appendix A, at p. 132, the Chief Superintendent, referring to the city of London, says:\nThe board of trustees deeming it proper to place within the reach of every class of the community, and of every child who might evince a taste and talent for a more extended range of studies than are generally pursued at common schools, facilities for the acquisition of literary and scientific attainments, equal to those afforded by the higher order of academies, directed the principal to introduce, in addition to the other studies, that of classics, and during the past year about twenty-five pupils have availed themselves of the advantages thus offered in the abstract sciences.\nIn the annual report of 1855 (Exhibit 12) the local superintendent of schools at Hamilton says, at p. 282:\nAny child under twenty-one years of age, whose parents reside within the city limits, and who is qualified for admission into the junior class, can, by applying, gain an entrance into the Central School, and can remain there, free of charge, until he has passed through the various classes, and if desirous, qualify himself for matriculation at the University. The course of instruction includes reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, grammar, history (Canadian, English and general), history of English literature, linear drawing, vocal music, book-keeping, human physiology, astronomy, elements of natural philosophy and chemistry, algebra, Euclid and mensuration, natural history, botany and geology, and the Latin, Greek and French languages. * * * The teachers at present engaged in the city schools number thirty, and include a principal, a classical master, a French master, a writing master, a music school master, thirteen division teachers in the Central School, and thirteen primary teachers.\nAnd, in the annual report of 1863, the Honourable Mr. Justice John Wilson, who had been local superintendent at London, at p. 154, reporting on the London common schools, says:\nThe board was unwilling to be connected with the County Grammar School. At the date secondly mentioned (1855), which I look upon as a turning point in our educational affairs in this place, something was added to the English course, with a few boys in the elements of the Latin language, forming merely a classical nucleus. * * * Now the English course is at once extensive and thorough, embracing every subject of importance to the mechanic, the merchant or the professional man. The classical department has been extended so as to embrace Latin, Greek and French, and made comprehensive enough to qualify students for entering upon the study of any of the learned professions, or to matriculate in any college or university in the province.\nThe annual report for 1867 (p. 89), showed in the counties, cities, towns and villages 31,132 common school pupils over 16 years of age, 72,987 doing high school work and 8,019 in the \u201chigher studies\u201d.\nWhile our attention was not drawn to any explicit evidence to that effect, there is little room for doubt that the attendance of pupils at the common schools who were taking the courses of high school work was included in the returns made for the purpose of ascertaining the proportion of the legislative grants to which the several school sections in which such schools were carried on were entitled (C.S.U.C., c. 64, ss. 106 (1) and 91 (1)); and also in determining the amount of public moneys to be apportioned to the separate schools (26 Vic., c. 5, s. 20). That could properly be done only if the trustees of common schools had the legal right to conduct the classes in which high school or classical education was given.\nIn the Journal of Education for September, 1865, (Exhibit 37), commenting on the new Grammar Schools Act, Dr. Ryerson (at p. 132) says:\nThe Common School law amply provides for giving the best kind of a superior English education in the High Schools, in the cities, towns and villages, with primary ward schools as feeders (as in Hamilton); while to allow Grammar Schools to do Common School work is a misapplication of Grammar School funds to Common School purposes; Common Schools are already adequately provided for. * * *\nAgain, in the issue of the same Journal for May, 1867, at p. 81 (Exhibit 38)\u2014only two months before Confederation, Dr. Ryerson writes:\nAnd according to the best opinions any course of studies which would attempt to be equally excellent for the higher education of both boys and girls, would be simply worthless for either. * * * It therefore becomes advisable to discourage the present unusual attendance of girls at the Grammar Schools.\nBut it is often urged that \u201cif our girls do not go to the grammar school there is no other provision made for their receiving an advanced education in our public schools.\u201d This is a mistake. The Consolidated Common School Act, section 79, subsection 8, authorizes the Common School Trustees of every city, town, or incorporated village \u201cto determine (a) the number, sites, kind and description of schools to be established and maintained in the city, town or village (whether they be high schools for boys and girls, or infant schools, etc.), also (b) the teacher or teachers to be employed; the terms of employing them; the amount of their remuneration; and the duties which they are to per- form.\u201d There is thus every legal facility for the establishment of high schools for girls throughout the country, and it is in such institutions that those pupils ought to find the means of prosecuting the advanced studies which they now seek in the grammar schools, and which if they find there, it is at the expense of not employing their time to the best advantage, and of studying some subjects which are of very little use to them. (Italics appear in the original.)\nThe law in force at Confederation was continued by s. 129 of the British North America Act and remained practically unchanged until 1871.\nIn the Journal of 1868, p. 84 (Exhibit 24), Dr. Ryerson says:\u2014\nI regret to observe that the evil of inducing girls to enter the Grammar Schools, with the apparent object of unduly swelling the number of pupils, has not diminished but has increased, although there are still several schools which are not open to this reproach. It therefore becomes the duty of the Department, in its administration of the law, to take care that no encouragement is offered to a course of action which is contrary to the intention of the Grammar School Law and Regulations, and injurious to the best interests of the schools and pupils.\nThe law invests School Trustees with ample powers for the establishment and maintenance of schools or departments of schools in which girls, who have passed through the elementary Common School studies, may obtain that higher culture and instruction which they may require. But the organization and studies of the Grammar Schools are not adapted for mixed classes of grown up girls and boys, nor is it desirable that such mixed classes should exist.\nThe matter is of so serious an aspect, that I felt it my duty to consult the Principal Law Officer of the Crown in this province as to the proper interpretation of the Law, and the following is the opinion he has given:\u2014\n\u201cMy interpretation of the Grammar School Act in relation to the question submitted by you is that boys alone should be admitted to those schools, and that consequently, the Grammar School Fund was intended for the classical, mathematical and higher English education of boys.\u201d\nIt therefore became my duty, as thus instructed, to apportion the grant of 1868 on the basis of the boys\u2019 attendance.\nAs against all this evidence indicative of the view current and acted upon by the provincial educational authorities about the time of Confederation, that trustees of common and separate schools had the legal right to provide for the secondary education of pupils attending their schools up to matriculation, the only document in the printed record on which the respondent relies shews the adoption by the Council of Public Instruction in 1858 of a regulation prescribing the courses of study for common schools, which was declared in the Separate School Manual of 1863, issued by the provincial educational authorities, to be applicable to Roman Catholic separate schools (Exhibit 5A). These \u201cprescribed studies\u201d may be regarded as those \u201crequired to be taught\u201d in the common schools (Exhibit 34 (1864), p. 75), i.e., as a minimum and not exclusive. While the curriculum of studies so prescribed was comparatively restricted, it included the first, six books of Euclid and mensuration of surfaces and solids, and, for boys, trigonometry, and other matters in the discretion of the trustees. Indeed it comprised most, if not all, that is obligatory in the curriculum prescribed for high schools to-day.\nOur attention has been drawn to extracts (not printed in the Record) from a letter of the Chief Superintendent, published in The Globe newspaper of the 27th of March, 1866, copied in the Journal of Education and reprinted in Exhibit 33, intituled \u201cGrammar School Manual\u201d (compiled by J. George Hodgins, LL.B., Deputy Superintendent), at pp. 73-4. The main purpose of this letter was, as indicated by its heading in the Manual, to emphasize \u201cThe Necessity for Uniform Text-books in all Common Schools.\u201d Incidentally the writer alludes to the power and duty of the Council of Public Instruction\nto prescribe the subjects of instruction in the public schools and the text-books which shall be used in giving that instruction.\nIt is then pointed out that\nteachers of public schools are not employed, therefore, to teach what subjects or books they please, but to teach those subjects and books which are prescribed by law.\nThe Statute (C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 64, s. 79 (8)) declares it to be the duty of the trustees \u201cto determine * * * the duties which (teachers) are to perform\u201d and (s. 82 (1)) of the teacher\nto teach diligently and faithfully all the branches required to be taught * * * according to the terms of his engagement with the trustees and according to the provisions of this Act.\nIf, upon a proper construction of the statutory law (C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 64, ss. 27 (8) and (16), 79 (8) and 82 (1), and s. 32, and 26 Vic., c. 5, ss. 3, 7, 9), separate school trustees were given the right, as part of the management of the schools entrusted to them, to determine that secondary education should be given in their schools, the power of regulation conferred on the Council of Public Instruction could not be utilized to prevent or restrict the exercise of that right. The subjects of that power were confined (C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 64, s. 119 (4)) to \u201cthe organization, government, and discipline of Common Schools\u201d and \u201cthe classification of Schools and Teachers. * * *\u201d We assume a like power of regulation over separate schools. The Council was not empowered to curtail the courses of studies to be pursued or to determine the extent of the education to be imparted in the schools. \u201cOrganization, government and discipline\u201d are not apt terms to confer such jurisdiction; and \u201cclassification\u201d does not imply anything of the kind. It had reference rather to the distribution of the pupils in classes according to the degree of advancement each had attained in his education and to the due arrangement of the courses of study so as to provide for the teaching which the several boards of trustees might deem suitable for local requirements and to ensure that the time of both teacher and pupil might be utilized to the best advantage, that there should be no overlapping in the work and that for each class and for each term of the course there should be provided a sufficient, but not an excessive, amount of work.\nThe system was voluntary; local self-determination was fundamental in it; there was the minimum of governmental control.\nThe character of the instruction given in every educational establishment is an expression of the people themselves upon the question of education. * * * The system begins and ends with the people. No school-house can be built, no teacher employed, no rate levied, except by the concurrence of the people. It was true that it was not voluntary as to the individual, but it was certainly voluntary in regard to the municipality. (Journal of Education, March, 1860, p. 34.)\nIt is significant that while the cognate matter of the recommendation and disapproval of text\u2011books for use in common schools is entrusted to the Council (s. 119 (5)), the delimitation of courses of study in those schools is not mentioned in the enumeration of its functions. When the Legislature intended to give the Council the right to determine the courses of study it readily found language apt for that purpose, as in the case of the grammar schools, for which the Council was empowered to \u201cprepare and prescribe a list of text-books, programme of studies, etc. * * *\u201d (C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 63, s. 15.)\nMore noteworthy still is the fact that the recommendation and disapproval of text-books is treated as something not comprised within the power of regulation. The two matters are kept distinct, being dealt with in different sub- sections (s. 119, sub-ss. 4-5). While the Act of 1863 subjected the separate schools to regulations to be imposed by the Council of Public Instruction (s. 26), it contained no provision committing to that body any supervision over the text-books to be used in those schools. In the selection of text-books, as in the determination of the courses of study to be pursued in each separate school, the discretion of the trustees elected for its management was untrammelled.\nThe statutes which entitled pupils up to the age of 21 years to attend the common and separate schools were certainly not designed to enable the Council of Public Instruction, under the guise of regulation, so to restrict the courses of studies for which the trustees might provide that they would be suitable only for pupils up to the age of, say, 12, or even 16 years.\nAs was forcibly pointed out during the argument, that would be to prohibit, not to regulate. (Corporation of City of Toronto v. Virgo[24]. If the power of regulation of the Council of Public Instruction could be so exercised, the work of the schools could be indefinitely cut down. No doubt, in the case of common schools, that might since Confederation be done directly by provincial statutes, or by regulations authorized by them, because as to schools other than denominational schools legally established no limitation is imposed on the jurisdiction of the Legislature. But that an emasculation of the courses of study which Catholic separate school trustees were at the Union entitled to provide in their denominational schools for pupils up to 21 years of age would prejudicially affect a right or privilege with respect to such schools legally enjoyed by them is indisputable; and it would also affect the privilege of denominational teaching in separate schools, because parents desirous of having their children receive such training in those schools up to the age of 21 years would be obliged to submit to the hardship of their obtaining only an inferior secular education. Legislation purporting to authorize such an injustice would contravene s. 93 (1) of the British North America Act; and it is obvious that what the legislature cannot do by direct action its creature may not do by regulation. For the respondent it is contended that in the pre-Confederation public school system of Upper Canada the legal right to give secondary education was vested solely in the grammar schools\u2014that they were designed to be the intermediate schools between the common schools and the university; and that if the common schools carried on \u201chigh school\u201d work it was only by toleration and not by legal right.\nThe latter part of this argument has already been dealt with.\nThe grammar schools were classical schools, Latin and Greek being compulsory subjects in their courses; but, while they were, no doubt, designed to impart secondary education, they also did primary and elementary school work. They were not really a part of the public school system. In 1867 they were governed by the provisions of the C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 63, which embodied, without material change, the Acts of 1853 (16 Vic., c. 186) and of 1855 (18 Vic., c. 132). The grammar schools were intended for boys only (Journal of Education, 1868, p. 84; Exhibit 24); when united with common schools (16 Vic., c. 186, s. 11 (4); C.S.U.C., 1859, s. 64, s. 27 (7) and s. 79 (9)) children of separate school supporters could not attend them (C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 64, s. 27 (16))\u2014and there was no provision for the union of grammar schools and separate schools. The more advanced common schools refused to unite with the grammar schools and themselves carried on \u201chigh school\u201d work with official approval. Unions were discouraged. Grammar schools were departmentally controlled as to their courses of study (16 Vic., c. 186, s. 6); there was no statutory right to attend them\u2014they were in fact select schools; and in many localities in Upper Canada, where secondary education was necessary, grammar schools were not accessible, and, if such education was to be available in those places, the common schools must impart it\u2014as in fact they did.\nMatters continued in that position for several years after Confederation, the changes complained of by the appellants having begun only in 1871. The common schools and the grammar schools then disappeared nominatim and there came into existence high schools (including collegiate institutes) for secondary education and public schools for primary and elementary education solely. It is now very generally assumed by \u201cthe man in the street\u201d that the public school of to-day has replaced the common school and that the high school is the successor of the grammar school. But that is only partially true. At Confederation the common schools were by law unrestricted in their courses of study and were obliged to provide for pupils up to 21 years of age, and in many cases, furnished secondary education suitable for pupils proceeding to matriculation. The public schools, when created in 1871 (34 Vic., c. 33), were obliged to provide education only for children up to the age of 12 years (s. 3) and were required to comply with regulations (s. 37), which restricted the courses of study to primary or elementary education. The high schools (including collegiate institutes) since 1871 do not engage in primary or elementary work; on the other hand Latin and Greek are not compulsory subjects in them (59 Ont. L.R., at p. 126, and Exhibit 21; Document No. 4, \u201cBook of Pamphlets\u201d, pp. 7, 8, 9); boys and girls alike have a statutory right to attend them (R.S.O., 1914, c. 268, s. 24 (c)); they are not select schools, but are common schools in the proper sense of that term.\nFrom this brief statement it is clear that, while the public schools of to-day do that part of the work formerly done in the lower classes of the common schools, i.e. the work of primary or elementary education, and the high schools (including collegiate institutes) have taken over the work of secondary education formerly done by the grammar schools, they have also taken over the same class of work which was concurrently done in the upper or high school classes of the more advanced pre-Confederation common schools, in which 72,987 pupils were being trained in 1867, of whom 8,019 pursued \u201cthe higher studies\u201d. (Ex. 14 pp. 88-9). In many particulars the high schools of to-day have the characteristics of the old common school. They are in fact quite as much the successors of those schools as they are of the superseded grammar schools. In so far as the legislation and the regulations governing high schools may interfere prejudicially with the rights and privileges legally enjoyed in 1867 by the Roman Catholic separate schools they are ultra vires. It is not surprising that the Chief Superintendent of Education, when transmitting to trustees, inspectors and teachers, in 1872, the regulations made under, and his instructions for the carrying out of, the Act of 1871, warned them that the\nnew School Act and Regulations do not in any way affect the Separate Schools. It was not intended to affect them when the Act was passed; and it would be unjust to the supporters of these schools thus to legislate for them indirectly, and without their knowledge. The Inspectors will, therefore, be particular not to apply the Act, or any of the new Regulations to Separate Schools. (Exhibit 52, p. 64.)\nThe rights and privileges of Roman Catholic separate school supporters and the scope, intent and effect of the perpetuation of them by s. 93 (1) of the B.N.A. Act were probably better understood and appreciated by the provincial educational authorities in 1872 (five years after Confederation) than they are now. Emphasis was given to the above-quoted warning by its repetition in 1873 (Exhibit 23, p. 80); and the Minister of Education expressed the same view in 1876. (Exhibit 49).\nInasmuch as continuation schools were the outgrowth of the continuation classes provided for long after Confederation in connection with the public schools, they do not call for any special consideration.\nIt would, therefore, seem to be abundantly clear that in 1867 the trustees of Catholic separate schools, charged with their management and clothed with the powers of trustees of common schools, had the right by law to provide in them the secondary education requisite to enable the children of their supporters to matriculate, to enter the Normal School, or to take up the study of any of the \u201clearned professions\u201d. Such education, then imparted by many common schools, included most, if not all, of the obligatory work now done in the Ontario high schools and was designed to meet the requirements of ordinary pupils up to the age of 21 years. While the obligation of the trustees to provide for pupils up to that age is set forth in the current Ontario Separate Schools Act (R.S.O., 1914, c. 270, s. 45 (d)), the present law and regulations would restrict the teaching to be given in Catholic separate schools to what is prescribed for the public schools of to-day, which are not required to provide for pupils over the age of 16 years. (R.S.O., 1914, c. 266, s. 73 (d)). (Under the Act of 1871 the public school obligatory age limit was 12 years of age). In other words, the present law and regulations of Ontario forbid Catholic separate schools to impart the high school education which they were legally entitled to furnish at Confederation. Under them, if Catholic pupils are to remain subject to the religious control and influence of their denominational schools, as in pre-Confederation days, until they reach the age of 21 years, it must be at the cost of acquiring in those schools only such education as is deemed suitable for pupils not over 16 years of age attending the public schools. (59 Ont. L.R. p. 133). It would seem to be very plain that a right or privilege enjoyed at Confederation by the Roman Catholics of Ontario in respect of their denominational schools is thus prejudicially affected.\n(B) The exemption of the separate school supporters under s. 14 of the Act of 1863 (26 Vic., c. 5) was\nfrom the payment of all rates imposed for the support of Common Schools, and of Common School Libraries, or for the purchase of land or erection of buildings for Common School purposes, within the City, Town, Incorporated Village or section in which he resides.\nFrom the fact that the Ontario continuation schools, high schools and collegiate institutes are now doing work which formed part of that formerly legally done, or which might have been so done, by the common schools, it follows that separate school supporters are entitled to exemption from rates for the support of such continuation schools, high schools and collegiate institutes. To compel Catholic separate school supporters to support the Ontario high schools, etc., and to use them, if they would give their children up to 21 years of age a secondary education, is prejudicially to affect the right or privilege enjoyed by Roman Catholics as a class at the Union of having such education given to their children under denominational influence and in separate schools managed by their own trustees. As put by Patterson, J., in Barrett v. Winnipeg[25].\nThe right of a class of persons with respect to denominational schools is injuriously affected if the effect of a law passed on the subject of education is to render it more difficult or less convenient to exercise the right to the best advantage.\n(C) Sections 20, 21 and 22 of the Separate Schools Act of 1863 (26 Vic., c. 5) read as follows: 20. Every Separate School shall be entitled to a share in the fund annually granted by the Legislature of this Province for the support of Common Schools, and shall be entitled also to a share in all other public grants, investments and allotments for Common School purposes now made or hereafter to be made by the Province or the Municipal authorities, according to the average number of pupils attending such school during the twelve next preceding months, or during the number of months which may have elapsed from the establishment of a new Separate School, as compared with the whole average number of pupils attending School in the same City, Town, Village or Township.\n21. Nothing herein contained shall entitle any such Separate School within any City, Town, Incorporated Village or Township to any part or portion of school moneys arising or accruing from local assessments for Common School purposes within the City, Town, Village or Township, or the County or Union of Counties within which the City, Town, Village or Township is situate.\n22. The Trustees of each Separate School shall, on or before the thirtieth day of June, and the thirty-first day of December of every year, transmit to the Chief Superintendent of Education for Upper Canada, a correct return of the names of the children attending such school, together with the average attendance during the six next preceding months, or during the number of months which have elapsed since the establishment thereof, and the number of months it has been so kept open; and the Chief Superintendent shall, thereupon, determine the proportion which the Trustees of such Separate School are entitled to receive out of the Legislative grant, and shall pay over the amount thereof to such Trustees.\nSection 33 of the Separate Schools Act in the C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 65, which embodied the material parts of s. 13 of the Tach\u00e9 Act of 1855 (18 Vic., c. 131), was in these terms:\n33. Every such Separate School shall be entitled to a share in the fund annually granted by the Legislature of this province for the support of Common Schools, according to the average number of pupils attending such School during the twelve next preceding months, or during the number of months which may have elapsed from the establishment of a new Separate School, as compared with the whole average number of pupils attending School in the same City, Town, Village or Township.\nThere is a striking difference between this provision and s. 20 of the Act of 1863. The basis of division remained the same\u2014pro rata according to the average attendance. But the Tach\u00e9 Act of 1855 and the C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 65, both gave the right to share only in \u201cthe fund annually granted by the Legislature of this Province for the support of Common Schools\u201d (i.e. the fund known as \u201cThe Common School Fund\u201d), while by the Act of 1863 the like right is given to\nshare in all other public grants, investments and allotments for Common School purposes now made or hereafter to be made by the Province or the Municipal authorities. All three statutes pointedly distinguish legislative and municipal grants of public moneys (which belonged to supporters of common schools and separate schools alike) from moneys raised for common school purposes by local assessments, to which separate school supporters did not contribute because they were exempt. In the former only were separate school supporters given the right to share. The policy of the Legislature up to Confederation plainly was to put both kinds of schools on an equal footing in regard to sharing in the appropriation of public money.\nThe language of s. 20 of the Act of 1863 is most comprehensive in describing the public grants in which the right to share was assured to the separate schools. Formerly restricted to a right to share in \u201cThe Common School Fund\u201d (a well-defined annual grant of long standing, which had been the subject of much legislation, and as to the distribution of which no complaint is made by the appellant), separate school supporters were in 1863 given the added right to \u201cshare in all other public grants,\u201d etc. There is no allusion to \u201cgeneral grants\u201d or \u201cspecial grants\u201d\u2014\u201cgrants for urban schools\u201d or \u201cgrants for rural schools\u201d\u2014\u201cconditional grants\u201d or \u201cunconditional grants.\u201d All such grants are \u201cpublic grants,\u201d i.e., grants of public moneys, in which common and separate school supporters have identical interests. Legislative and municipal grants for common school purposes differ widely from the annual legislative grant of \u201cThe Common School Fund.\u201d The latter is, to a substantial extent, a vote of the income of public moneys already set aside for educational purposes, while the former are wholly gratuitous grants of public moneys not so earmarked. In s. 20 of the Separate Schools Act, 1863, instead of merely adding the words \u201cand in all other public grants,\u201d etc., immediately after the words in the Tach\u00e9 Act \u201cshall be entitled to a share in the fund annually granted by the Legislature of this Province for the support of Common Schools,\u201d the Legislature made the additional grants, to which the right of sharing was then extended, the subject of a distinct clause in these words:\nand shall be entitled also to a share in all other public grants, investments and allotments for Common School purposes now made or hereafter to be made by the Province or the Municipal authorities.\nNot only are the words \u201cshall be entitled to a share\u201d unnecessarily repeated, if the additional benefits conferred be restricted to grants ejusdem generis with the grant of \u201cThe Common School Fund,\u201d but an intention to exclude the application of that rule of construction, or of the kindred maxim \u201cnoscitur a sociis\u201d (which would, if applicable, cut down the comprehensive words \u201call other public grants,\u201d etc., to mean only \u201cgeneral grants,\u201d i.e., grants for common school purposes generally), is further evidenced by the fact that the added clause deals with investments and allotments as well as grants and with municipal as well as provincial grants, etc. A distinction is also made, no doubt advisedly, in regard to the expressed purposes of the respective grants, the object of the earlier grant of \u201cThe Common School Fund\u201d being designated \u201cfor the support of common schools,\u201d while that of the latter is stated in the broader terms \u201cfor common school purposes.\u201d As observed by Lopes L.J., in Anderson v. Anderson[26]:\u2014\nThe doctrine of ejusdem generis is a very valuable servant, but it would be a most dangerous master.\nIn the same case Lord Esher, M.R., said, at p. 753:\u2014\nPrima facie you are to give the words their larger meaning.\nTo exclude from the additional monetary benefits in which the right to \u201ca share\u201d was conferred on the separate schools in 1863 grants \u201cfor a common school purpose,\u201d made to particular schools, or otherwise restricted, and conditional grants for any such purpose, would defeat the apparent intention of the Legislature in 1863 to put separate schools on a footing of absolute equality with common schools in regard to all grants, municipal or legislative, of public moneys. Given such an application, the doctrine ejusdem generis would indeed be \u201ca dangerous master.\u201d The only qualifications which the Legislature attached to the educational grants, legislative and municipal, in which it gave the separate schools the right to share, were that they should be \u201cof public moneys\u201d and should be made \u201cfor common school purposes.\u201d\nBut, it is said, if the Legislature of Ontario should see fit to restrict a grant to a particular common school or schools, or to make a grant for a particular purpose\u2014such as, to aid schools in which \u201cDarwinism\u201d shall be taught\u2014to apportion a share of any such special grant, in the former case to separate schools, and in the latter to schools in which \u201cDarwinism\u201d is not taught, would be to make a grants which the Legislature had not made. No doubt moneys so granted cannot be appropriated otherwise than as the Legislature directs; but the consequence is that any grant of that kind which prejudicially affects the right of separate schools under s. 20 of the Separate Schools Act, 1863, is ultra vires\u2014whether it be provincial or municipal. Since Confederation for the purposes of s. 20, no distinction can be made between the powers of municipal councils and the powers of the Provincial Legislature. Section 93 (1) of the B.N.A. Act admittedly forbids any invasion of the legal rights of denominational schools as existing at Confederation. In regard to the particular matter now being dealt with, the situation thus created is precisely the same as if the British North America Act had contained a provision in these words:\u2014\nOut, of every grant of public moneys to be made by the Legislature of the Province of Ontario, or the municipal authorities of that Province, for common school purposes, there shall be paid to every Separate School a share thereof proportionate to the average number of pupils attending such school during the twelve next preceding months, or during the number of months which have elapsed since the establishment of a new Separate School, as compared with the whole average number of pupils attending School in the same City, Town, Village or Township.\nIf, therefore, a grant of public moneys is made by the Legislature or by a municipal authority to aid or assist in the carrying out of what would in 1867 have been deemed a common school purpose, either it must be so made that it is apportionable between the common schools (or their present day successors) and the separate schools, or compensation to the latter for their proportion of such grant must be provided for.\nIt may be that under s. 20 of the Separate Schools Act of 1863 there was no assurance that any grants other than that of \u201cThe Common School Fund\u201d would be made in the future for common school purposes; but a definite right to share pro rata in such other grants, if and when made, was thereby assured to the separate schools. After 1863 municipal authorities in Upper Canada could not grant public moneys for any common school purpose except on the basis provided by s. 20 of the Separate Schools Act. They were absolutely bound by its provisions. Of course until Confederation the Legislature of Canada retained full power to repeal or amend s. 20 of the Separate Schools Act. It could, either expressly or by implication, direct that s. 20 should not apply to any grant which it, or a municipal council, might make to a particular school, or for any common school purpose or purposes, or subject to any condition. But the Ontario Legislature cannot do so since 1867 if the consequence would be to affect prejudicially the right of separate schools to share, on the basis prescribed by s. 20, in all provincial or municipal grants of public moneys for common school purposes. The Ontario Legislature may deal as it pleases with the proportion of its grants for \u201ccommon school purposes\u201d in which separate schools are not interested. It may divide or dispose of that \u201cproportion\u201d in any way it sees fit amongst \u201cpublic schools\u201d and \u201chigh schools\u201d etc.; but every dollar appropriated by it to aid those schools or the work done in them, whether by way of general grant or special grant, (saving moneys granted to high schools in continuation of former grammar school appropriations) must be taken into account and treated as a payment to them \u201cfor common school purposes\u201d in determining the share of \u201cpublic grants\u201d to which the separate schools are entitled.\nThe protection assured to separate schools by s. 93 (1) of the B.N.A. Act in regard to public aid is that their right to share pro rata on the basis of average attendance in all public moneys devoted to common school purposes should not be prejudicially affected by provincial legislation. Assuming the utmost good faith, and excluding any idea of a design to circumvent the provision of s. 20 of the Act of 1863, every grant for a common school purpose, whether made for a particular school or schools, or made subject to some restrictive term or condition, comes within the ambit of the protection of s. 93 (1) of the B.N.A. Act. The right to share in all such grants is given by s. 20 of the Act of 1863 in the plainest possible terms; and the power of the Provincial Legislature to defeat that right or to affect it to the prejudice of the supporters of such schools has been categorically negatived by the Imperial Parliament. The question is purely one of legislative power.\nThe Common and the Separate Schools Acts alike were continued in force after the Union by s. 129 of the B.N.A. Act as provincial legislation of Ontario, subject to repeal and amendment by the legislature, as to common schools without restriction, and as to separate schools within the limitations imposed by s. 93 (1) of that Act. Dobie v. The Church Temporalities Board[27]; Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[28]. The presence of the words \u201cthis Province\u201d and \u201cthe Province\u201d in s. 20 of the Separate Schools Act of 1863 did not render that provision inapplicable after Confederation to the changed conditions which it brought about, as is argued for the respondent. Those terms meant after 1867 the new Province of Ontario which, as erected by s. 6 of the B.N.A. Act, comprises that part of the Province of Canada which had, prior to 1841, constituted the Province of Upper Canada and to which alone the Common Schools Act (C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 64) and the Separate Schools Act (26 Vic., c. 5) applied. Indeed it might be contended with equal force that, because \u201cthe Legislature\u201d mentioned in s. 106 of the Common Schools Act (C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 64) had meant the legislature of the Province of Canada when that section was enacted, it could not after Confederation mean the legislature of the Province of Ontario, and that common schools in Ontario after the Union (1867-1871) were no longer the \u201cCommon Schools in Upper Canada\u201d for the purposes of s. 106, since Upper Canada had ceased to exist. As is truly stated in the appellants\u2019 factum (pp. 28-9):\nConfederation was the result of a compromise wherein the religious minority in both Upper and Lower Canada were guaranteed protection for their denominational or separate state-aided schools, and it would have startled and shocked the statesmen of that day had it been suggested that the obligations resting upon the then Province of Canada in respect to such state aid could be ignored by the Provinces to be established in place of the old Province, or, in other words, of the division of the Province of Canada into two Provinces, with the result that in Upper Canada or the Province of Ontario and in Lower Canada or the Province of Quebec, there was no guarantee of the Separate Schools sharing in state aid from annual grants for Common School purposes, but that after the Union the Legislature of Ontario and that of Quebec could make grants for Common School purposes without the Separate Schools being entitled to a share.\nIt may be reasonably assumed that there was then no intention or desire by the Province of Ontario to evade the obligation that in that respect rested upon the Province of Canada, and that it was assumed that this obligation did continue is evidenced by the Separate Schools Acts passed from time to time by the Legislature of the Province of Ontario down to 1906, as appears in the Statutes.\nNor do the words, \u201cand not otherwise appropriated by law\u201d, appended in s. 106 of the Common Schools Act (C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 64) to the description of the legislative grants to be apportioned by the Chief Superintendent, present a formidable difficulty. Section 20 of the Act of 1863 is subsequent legislation and, so far as there may be inconsistency, the terms of that section must prevail over those of s. 106 of the Act of 1859. Section 20 of the Act of 1863 precludes an appropriation by law of any grants made for common school purposes which would prevent the separate schools sharing proportionately in them.\nWhether the legislature could validly formulate a scheme or impose conditions for the distribution amongst the separate schools themselves, other than on the basis of average attendance, of the proportion of the total grants for common school purposes, as understood in 1867, to which the separate schools as a whole were entitled, is, perhaps, a debatable question. The facts that s. 20 of the Separate Schools Act of 1863 gives the right to share \u201cto every separate school\u201d and that s. 22 requires that payment be made by the Chief Superintendent directly to the trustees of each separate school of its proportion of the legislative grant, should not be lost sight of in considering this aspect of the matter. Having regard to the primary apportionment amongst the municipalities of moneys to be granted by the legislature for the support of common schools, directed by s. 106 of the Common Schools Act (C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 64) to be made \u201caccording to the ratio of population in each\u201d municipality, it would seem probable that where there is but one separate school in the municipality it is entitled absolutely to its entire pro rata share on the basis of average attendance of the moneys appropriated to such municipality and that the question suggested can arise only where there are several separate schools in the same municipality. But in no event may the share of any grant to which the separate schools of the Province are entitled be entirely or partly withheld from them so that the total amount payable to them as a whole will be lessened. With the rights of separate schools inter se in the distribution of the grants of public moneys, however, we are not presently concerned. That the separate schools throughout the province, taken as a whole, have the right to receive annually a share in all public moneys validly granted for common school purposes (as understood in 1867) proportionate to the average attendance at such schools and that any such grants so made as to preclude the separate schools so sharing therein and without compensation being otherwise provided, are void, are, in our opinion, the certain consequences of the perpetuation by s. 93 (1) of the B.N.A. Act of the rights and privileges conferred by s. 20 of the Separate Schools Act of 1863. To hold otherwise would be to render illusory in a most material particular the substantial protection to religious minority rights in regard to education which the Imperial legislation of 1867 was designed to assure.\nThe parties agreed that in the event of the original suppliants being entitled to any proportion of the grants for common school purposes in the year 1922 (to which the suppliants\u2019 monetary claim is presently confined), payment of which was withheld for non-fulfilment of some conditions attached to them, their recovery should be for the sum of $736 demanded in the petition. Possibly for that reason no particulars were given as to the items of which this sum is composed. We are, therefore, unable to determine whether the grants of which portions were withheld from the original suppliant were or were not so made as to prevent \u201cevery separate school\u201d from sharing in them. If so made, they were void and no part of them is recoverable. The claim for $736, therefore, cannot succeed.\nWe are, for the foregoing reasons, of the opinion that the appellants are entitled to the following declarations for which they pray, to wit:\u2014\n1. Every board of trustees of the Roman Catholic separate schools has the right to establish and conduct in the school or schools under its jurisdiction courses of study and grades of education such as are conducted in what are now described as continuation schools, collegiate institutes and high schools and any and all such regulations purporting to prohibit, limit, or in any way prejudicially affect that right are invalid and ultra vires.\n2. Supporters of Roman Catholic separate schools are exempt from the payment of rates imposed for the support of any continuation school, collegiate institute or high school not conducted by the board of Roman Catholic separate school trustees for the municipality or school section in which they reside. Section 39 (1) of the High Schools Act (R.S.O., 1914, c. 268) is invalid as to supporters of separate schools.\n3. Every statutory provision enacted by the Legislature of the Province of Ontario, which involves a departure from the principle of apportionment between common and separate schools pro rata on the basis of average attendance at such schools, as provided by s. 20 of the Separate Schools Act of 1863 (26 Vic., c. 5), of all legislative and municipal grants of public moneys for any purpose that was, under the law as it stood in 1867, a common school purpose, (saving grants to high schools in continuation of former grammar school appropriations), would, if valid, prejudicially affect a right or privilege with respect to their denominational schools which Roman Catholics had by law at the Union and is, therefore, ultra vires. Each of the statutory provisions enumerated in paragraph (2) of the prayer of the Petition of Right falls within this category.\nThe appeal should accordingly be allowed to the extent indicated.\nDUFF J.\u2014The claims of the appellants reduce themselves to two. The first concerns the right, which they allege the Roman Catholics in Ontario possess, to establish and conduct, free from control or regulation by the Legislature as respects the scope of instruction, denominational schools of the character of those known as \u201ccommon schools\u201d in 1867, which designation would include, it is contended, schools of the type and status of the present high schools, collegiate institutes and continuation schools; coupled with a consequential exemption from all taxation for the support of such last mentioned schools. The second concerns the rights of such denominational schools in relation to public grants in aid of education.\nIt is important, first of all, to state, succinctly, but with some precision, the propositions of law and fact which the appellants advance in support of these claims.\nAs to the first, it is said that at the date of Confederation Roman Catholics, in Upper Canada, enjoyed, by law, the right to establish denominational schools and to conduct them by boards of trustees chosen by themselves; that, as respects text-books and courses of study, free and unfettered control of such schools was vested, by law, in the several boards of trustees, whose authority was sufficient to enable them to sanction courses of study coextensive in scope with those now pursued in high schools, collegiate institutes and continuation schools.\nThat by force of s. 93 (1), Roman Catholics of Ontario now enjoy these same autonomous rights coupled with the consequential right of exemption from taxation above indicated; that these rights are constitutional rights, and that any legislation is void, which, if valid, would prejudicially affect them.\nAs to the second claim, it is said that, by the Separate Schools Act of 1863, which remained in force at Confederation, every separate school, that is to say, every Roman Catholic denominational school established pursuant to law, was entitled to receive a part of every sum of money granted by the Legislature for \u201ccommon school purposes\u201d (which phrase included, by the appellants\u2019 construction of it, the maintenance of schools of the types of the present secondary as well as elementary schools), and that this part was determined (without regard to the purpose or conditions of the grant) by an arithmetical ratio, based upon the number of pupils attending the school and having no relation to the subjects taught, the text\u2011books used or the efficiency of instruction\u2014every separate school being entitled to its part, calculated according to the alleged statutory ratio, however advanced, however rudimentary, the nature of the education imparted might be. This right to share in the public grants, it is said, is now also a constitutional right, guaranteed by s. 93 (1) of the British North America Act. It will be convenient to consider these two sets of propositions separately; but before proceeding to do so, it is well to observe that they seem to entail this consequence: that every supporter of a separate school, however elementary the character of the education may be, which is imparted by the denominational school or schools in his section or municipality, is exempt, not only from taxation for the support of public schools, but from all taxation also for the support of secondary schools; an exemption that was valid fifty years ago, if valid to-day. The appellants\u2019 propositions also involve this further consequence, that every separate school, as to courses of study and text-books, is under the independent dominion of its board of trustees, who may prescribe only the most rudimentary studies; and yet each separate school, however rudimentary the studies pursued, is entitled to its part of all sums granted by the Legislature for \u201ccommon school purposes\u201d, which purposes include, I repeat, as the appellants contend, the maintenance of schools of the type of the present collegiate institutes.\nWe are concerned only with rights protected by s. 93 (1) of the British North America Act, rights relating to denominational schools existing at the date of the Union and established by law; rights, that is to say, which could be maintained, as the trial judge observes, \u201cin face of opposition\u201d, rights which the courts would be bound to enforce or protect; and which were, moreover, declared in some statutory enactment in operation at that date.\nI shall first consider the appellants\u2019 propositions touching the character of the schools they were entitled to maintain and the extent to which they were under an exclusive denominational control; the question of the public grants will be examined separately. The Attorney-General takes his stand upon the conclusion unanimously adopted in the Ontario Courts, that the rights bestowed upon Roman Catholics by the statutes in force at the relevant date in relation to their denominational schools were no wider than this: they were entitled to establish schools of the class known as \u201ccommon schools\u201d, to manage them by boards of trustees nominated by themselves, but with respect, inter alia, to the courses of study to be followed, it was their duty to proceed in obedience to such regulations as might be promulgated by the central educational authority of the province, the Council of Public Instruction.\nIt will be observed that the appellants\u2019 propositions divide themselves into two branches: first, schools known as \u201ccommon schools\u201d were intended to provide, where that was desirable in the view of the local authorities, courses of study sufficiently advanced to enable the pupils to obtain the necessary preparation for entrance to the provincial university or the learned professions; to provide, it is said, let me repeat, a programme of studies not inferior in scope to the programmes now defining the courses of study in the secondary schools of to-day.\nSecond, within the superior limit, thus indicated, each board of trustees had supreme discretionary power as to the courses of studies to be pursued in the schools within its jurisdiction, and, in the case of separate schools, this authority extended to the use of text\u2011books.\nThe appellants, in order to succeed, must make good their propositions on both these branches; they must establish that the legislation on the subject of common schools contemplated schools of the advanced character mentioned, and they must also establish that, in the conduct of such schools, boards of trustees were, as regards text-books and programmes of study, independent of the regulative authority of the Council of Public Instruction. Obviously, if such schools were in these respects subject to an over-riding authority in the Council, the appellants have no legal ground for inpeaching legislation upon these subjects, or regulations upon them, of a character which could lawfully have been put into force by the Council of Public Instruction in exercise of its controlling powers.\nPrimarily, we must look to the Separate Schools Act of 1863 to ascertain the measure of control Roman Catholics were entitled to exercise over their denominational schools; and also the degree in which such schools were subordinated to the dominion of the Council of Public Instruction.\nFour sections of the statute (the 4th, 9th, 13th and 26th) require attention here, but of these we are at present chiefly concerned with the 26th.\nThe language of that section is this:\nThe Roman Catholic Separate Schools shall be subject to such inspection, as may be directed, from time to time, by the Chief Super- intendent of Education, and shall be subject also to such regulations, as may be imposed, from time to time, by the Council of Public Instruction for Upper Canada.\nThe view of this section, which naturally first presents itself, regards it as investing the Council with a comprehensive authority to pass general regulations governing the management and conduct of separate schools.\nThe first member, dealing with inspection, purports, independently of any other legislation upon the subject, to entrust the Chief Superintendent with complete discretionary power. So, also, in this view, the second member, ex proprio vigore, imports the bestowal upon the Council of the fullest authority to formulate regulations, which it is the duty of the separate school authorities to observe\u2014\u201csuch regulations as may be imposed from time to time.\u201d\nTwo other views suggest themselves as to the effect of the second branch of s. 26. First, that the authority thereby given does not include control by the Council over separate schools in matters other than those in relation to which jurisdiction may, from time to time, be entrusted to the Council, under the Common Schools Acts or other legislation; that the section envisages the Council as a body charged with public duties and endowed with powers of regulation in respect of defined subject matters under the existing Common School Acts or under subsequent amending legislation, and that in all such matters (but only such) the separate schools are subordinated to the Council. According to the other view (and subject to one qualification, this construction is adopted in Mr. Hellmuth\u2019s argument), the office of the section is merely to declare that the Council\u2019s functions, as affecting separate schools, have relation to the subject matters (and those only), which, at the date of the statute, were within the field of its authority under the Common School Acts\u2014so that in exercising those functions, it would always remain subject to the limits fixed by those Acts at that date.\nThe appellants\u2019 argument adopts this last mentioned construction, with the qualification that the Council\u2019s authority does not, by force of s. 26, extend to the subject of text-books.\nEither the first or second of these three interpretations, as it seems to me, is preferable to the third. The section places separate schools under the dominion of regulations put into force from time to time; in terms there are no limits as to subject matter or otherwise. In fulfilling its duties under the section, the Council would, of course, be bound to observe any limitations governing it by force of the pertinent enactments of the Separate School law, as well as those necessarily proceeding from the nature of the subject matter; the duty being a duty to regulate only, must be performed in good faith for the purpose for which it is imposed, and, especially, with a vigilant eye to the fact that the purpose of the legislation was to make better provision for a system of Roman Catholic denominational schools. But, subject to this, there appears to be no very potent reason for restricting the natural sense of the words. Resort to other legislation seems unnecessary. And if the section is said to contemplate the Council, in exercising its powers thereunder, as acting within the field marked out by the Common School Acts, the words, on the more natural reading of them, would seem to direct us, for our guidance, to the provisions of those Acts at the time of the exercise of the power, rather than at the date of the Separate Schools Act.\nIn my own view of the Common School Acts, further discussion of the relative merits of these three readings would be superfluous. I shall proceed, for the present, upon the footing that the construction advocated by the appellants (except as touching the subject of text-books) is the right construction. Even on this assumption, it will sufficiently appear from a strict examination of the provisions of the Common School Acts, invoked by the appellants, that they furnish no reliable ground for overturning the conclusion of the Ontario judges as to the scope of the Council\u2019s powers; a view which, it will appear, dictated the practice of the Council itself in exercising its functions under the statutes of 1850 and 1859\u2014a practice, which was, it will further be seen, acquiesced in by the Legislature itself.\nThe relevant provisions of s. 119 of the Common Schools Act of 1859 are to be found in clauses 2, 3, 4 and 5, which are in these words:\u2014\n119. It shall be the duty of such Council, and they are hereby empowered;\n2. To adopt all needful measures for the permanent establishment and efficiency of the Normal School for Upper Canada, containing one or more Model Schools for the instruction and training of Teachers of Common Schools in the science of Education and the art of Teaching;\n3. To make from time to time the rules and regulations necessary for the management and government of such Normal School; to prescribe the terms and conditions on which students will be received and instructed therein; to select the location of such school, and erect or procure and furnish the building therefor; to determine the number and compensation of teachers, and of all others who may be employed therein; and to do all lawful things which such Council may deem expedient to promote the objects and interests of such school;\n4. To make such regulations from time to time, as it deems expedient, for the organization, government and discipline of Common Schools, for the classification of Schools and Teachers, and for School Libraries throughout Upper Canada;\n5. To examine, and at its discretion, recommend or disapprove of text-books for the use of schools or books for School Libraries.\nClause 4, if alone, could hardly be susceptible of debate. There are two subject matters for regulation, or rather perhaps, two phrases designating a group of subject matters: \u201cthe organization, government and discipline of common schools,\u201d and the \u201cclassification of schools and teachers.\u201d These phrases in their unstrained meaning denote subject matters of regulation which include branches of instruction; and \u201cclassification of schools,\u201d in the ordinary purport of the words, embraces the function of determining the different classes and their several typical characteristics.\nVarious reasons are propounded by the appellants for ascribing to these phrases a narrower compass. I shall first consider those reasons which derive any substance they possess from the terms of the common school legislation itself.\nThe provision of the Common Schools Act to which the appellants appear to ascribe the greatest force is clause 8 of section 79, which defines the powers of urban boards of trustees. By that clause such trustees are authorized and required to determine the several kinds and descriptions of schools which shall be maintained under their jurisdiction. This clause, it is argued, is incompatible with the attribution to the Council of supreme control over courses of study and \u201cclassification of schools.\u201d\nTo each board of trustees the task, it is said, is committed of classifying the schools under its charge, and this clause, it is argued, empowers the board to do this by reference to the character of the instruction in them; and this, it is further said, conveys the right to prescribe the branches of study. And again, the argument runs, in fulfilling this mandate, the trustees are invested with an independent discretion, untrammelled by superior authority.\nI have searched the statute without success for something to justify this version of sections 79 and 119. The intention to subordinate boards of trustees to the Council in matters over which the Council has the power of regulation is positively declared by clause 16 of section 79, which directs such boards to see that the schools under their care are \u201cconducted according to the authorized regulations.\u201d In light of this provision, clause 8 of section 79, and clause 4 of section 119 must not be read as conflicting or mutually exclusive but as complementary enactments. We need not stop to discuss the precise effect of clause 8. This seems beyond dispute; it is the duty of trustees, in \u201cclassifying\u201d (to quote the phrase of the Chief Superintendent) the schools within their jurisdiction, to observe the regulations upon that subject proceeding from the Council. If, as the appellants argue, they are entitled, in performing their duty under that clause, to act according to a canon based, as suggested, upon subjects of instruction\u2014then, they are, it cannot be doubted, subordinate to the paramount jurisdiction of the Council in relation to the subject \u201cclassification of schools.\u201d\nThe argument of the appellants virtually deletes the phrase \u201cclassification of schools\u201d from clause 4. The phrase can hardly, in this context, be read as denoting the classification of pupils; which seems rather to fall under the wider subject \u201cgovernment and discipline of schools.\u201d As this reading, however, is the only alternative reading suggested by the appellants, it is proper to observe that, if adopted, it would not at all advance the argument. \u201cClassification of pupils,\u201d if these words have any substance at all, includes the arrangement of classes by reference to the subjects of instruction and the stages of advancement which the pupils have reached. It would not be easy to reconcile the possession by the Council of final authority in relation to the subject so described with the possession by the boards of trustees of completely autonomous jurisdiction in relation to subjects of instruction and \u201cclassification of schools\u201d in the proper sense of the words. Indeed, there seems little room for doubt that the ordinary and natural reading of clause 4 is the true reading. \u201cClassification,\u201d as applied to \u201cschools\u201d in the sentence in which it here occurs, can have no other force than that which it has when applied to \u201cteachers\u201d\u2014grouping them into classes and ascribing its appropriate qualifications to each class. Furthermore, this argument which attributes to clause 8, section 79, the effect of so limiting the natural meaning of clause 4 of section 119 as to exclude courses of study from the regulative jurisdiction of the Council, seems to ignore the fact that no such clause as clause 8 forms any part of s. 27, in which the powers of rural boards of trustees are enumerated. The nearest approach to clause 8 to be found in that section is clause 6 by which such trustees are empowered to establish a female as well as a male school.\nIf the argument be sound and the subject matter of courses of instruction be not within the scope of s. 119, then the Act is silent upon the regulation of that subject matter in rural schools. It is nothing to the purpose to say, as appears to have been contended in the courts below by the appellants, that, by force of s. 7 of the Act of 1863, all the powers of urban trustees, under s. 79 of the Common Schools Act, are entrusted to rural as well as to urban boards of separate school trustees. Even if this proposition could be accepted, it leaves untouched the difficulty, just mentioned, as to the regulation under the Common Schools Act of the conduct of instruction in rural schools. But the proposition itself is inadmissible. By s. 7 of the Act of 1863, trustees of separate schools are to have as respects separate schools the powers that trustees of common schools \u201chave and possess, under the provisions of the Act relating to Common Schools.\u201d There is nothing in the Common Schools Act investing any board of trustees with authority to direct the conduct of instruction in rural schools. Assuming clause 8 to have the meaning put forward, it confers no jurisdiction on anybody, over any rural school; and there is nothing in s. 7 of the Separate Schools Act, which can properly be read as endowing the board of trustees of such schools with authority to ignore, in the exercise of their powers, the limits necessarily imposed, by the terms in which such powers are defined in the Common Schools Act. Another argument must be noticed, which is derived from the form of s. 6 of the Grammar Schools Act of 1853, where the powers of the Council, as touching such schools, are set forth. By that section the Council is required to \u201cprescribe a list of text-books, programme of studies and general rules and regulations for the organization and government of the County Grammar Schools.\u201d In this context, it is argued, the general words \u201cOrganization and government\u201d as applied to schools cannot include text-books and programmes of studies, which are specifically mentioned. And the use of the phrase \u201corganization and government\u201d in this sense, supplies a reason, it is urged, for similarly restricting the meaning of the same phrase in the clause we are considering. This argument, by which we are invited to resort to a statute passed in 1853, for the construction of an enactment, passed in 1850, I do not find convincing. It is always unsafe to construe the general and unambiguous language of one enactment by reference to phrases found in another. McLaughlin v. Westgarth[29]. Phrases and even clauses are so often introduced into Bills on their passage through Parliament in response to importunities from various quarters, that such discrepancies can seldom be safely relied upon as furnishing a clue to the intention of the legislature. The history of grammar schools in Upper Canada, disclosed in the material before us, suggests an adequate explanation of the explicit mention of text-books and studies.\nThe common school legislation provides other much more apposite and useful contrasts. The system of common schools was instituted by a statute of 1841; and, by that statute, the regulation of courses of study and text-books was committed to the local authorities (the School Commissioners) who, in townships and parishes, were annually elected, and, in incorporated cities and towns, were appointed by the several corporations. The Act provided for a Superintendent of Education, who was invested with no regulative authority over text\u2011books or studies of any kind in respect of the conduct of schools; but (s. 4, sub-s. 5) was required to address to the persons employed in carrying out the provisions of the Act \u201csuch suggestions as may tend to the establishment of uniformity in the conduct of the Common Schools throughout this Province.\u201d\nSection 7, subsection 4, of this statute may usefully be quoted in full. By it the Commissioners were entrusted with a duty\nto regulate for each school, respectively, the course of study to be followed in such school, and the books to be used therein, and to establish general rules for the conduct of the schools, and communicate them, in writing, to the respective teachers.\nComplete local autonomy in relation to studies, text-books and generally in the management and conduct of the schools was a dominant principle of the common school system as first established. But, in 1850, this system has undergone a striking transformation. Local authority to regulate studies, to regulate text-books, \u201cto establish general rules for the conduct of the schools and communicate them in writing to the respective teachers\u201d finds no place in the statute of that year. For this local control there is substituted the central authority of the Council of Public Instruction to pass regulations under the terms of clause 4, section 119, and to deal with the subject of text-books as provided in clause 5; coupled with the enactments requiring local authorities to see that the regulations of the Council are observed. These changes point to an intention to improve the efficiency of the common schools by subjecting them to an over-riding central control. The progress of legislation in these years, at all events, gives little countenance to the surmise that it was the design of the legislature in 1850 and later to leave each school to exclusive control of the local board of trustees in the primary essentials of education.\nI come now to a branch of the appellants\u2019 argument to which the appellants themselves attach a high degree of importance. The argument is that the provision of section 119 (clause 5 of that section), entrusting the Council with certain functions therein defined, in respect of the use of text-books in schools, justifies, by reason of the frame of it, an inference that the subject matters of regulation designated in clause 4 were not intended to include programmes of study. The presence of clause 5, according to the argument, containing, as it does, a special disposition upon the subject of text-books, requires us to read clause 4 as excluding that subject from its purview; and, it is said that if the general language of clause 4 does not embrace that subject, it must also exclude the kindred matter, programmes of study. When the structure of section 119 is examined, and in particular the structure of clause 5, and especially when the history of the two clauses is also taken into account, it will be seen that there is little substance in this contention.\nClause 4 is concerned with a power of regulation which ex facie is an unrestricted power, or restricted only by reference to the designated subject matters; it is a power to make \u201csuch regulations, from time to time\u201d as the Council \u201cdeems expedient\u201d. This power extends to subject matters defined by comprehensive, general terms, \u201corganization, government and discipline of schools\u201d, \u201cclassification of schools and teachers\u201d. While ex facie, the various matters comprehended under these general expressions are all within the ambit of the clause, no emphasis is laid upon any particular matter, nor is any duty imposed in terms to deal with any particular matter in any special way or at all. The Council are given the fullest discretion as to the time and manner in which they shall discharge any particular branch or phase of the responsibilities committed to them. Clause 5, on the other hand, is concerned with a particular subject\u2014text-books, and, in connection with that matter, a duty is imposed upon the Council; the duty to examine text-books. And then the Council is invested with a discretion to recommend or to disapprove of text-books examined with a view to the use of them in schools.\nOf all matters which ex facie are comprehended within the general words in clause 4, one matter is singled out for special treatment, under clause 5. This clause does not, as clause 4 does in itself, endow the Council, simpliciter, with a general authority to make regulations. As to the subject with which it is concerned, the functions of the Council are stated with much greater particularity: to examine; to recommend; to disapprove, under a sanction nominated in another section. The draughtsman has carefully avoided any words which might be construed as imparting a general authority to regulate. This clause, then, treats the subject matter with which it deals as standing in a special category; the Legislature, in order to express its intention has selected language which shows that the object of clause 5 would not have been attained, had that clause been omitted, and the subject of text-books left at large, under the general jurisdiction of the Council under clause 4. The presence of such a clause would appear to justify no inference leading to any restriction of the applicability of the general words of clause 4 in relation to any subject other than text-books.\nThis conclusion becomes even less doubtful when one looks at the origin and history of the two clauses. Provision was first made in the Act of 1846 for the Council of Public Instruction (under the name of the Board of Education), and in that Act clause 5 of the statutes of 1850 and 1859 first appeared as clause 2 of section 3\u2014the subject of text-books having been, as already mentioned, by the earlier statute of 1841, committed to the independent control of the local authorities.\nBefore the passing of the statute of 1846, the Chief Superintendent, and others concerned for the welfare of the recently established popular schools, had come to realize some of the evils arising from a diversity of text-books, which are discussed at length in the reports of the Chief Superintendent during the twenty succeeding years. It was then determined that some authority over the subject must be vested in a central body. It was considered that, at the beginning, at all events, it would be sufficient to give that body a power of recommendation only; and the Act of 1846, when it took the form of law, contained a clause corresponding with that which appears in the Act of 1859, except that in the clause itself the sanction attached to the use of a disapproved text-book (loss of the government grant) appears in the clause itself, and not in a separate section, as in the later Act of 1859.\nThe policy which inspired this clause did not go into effect without vigorous opposition. This subject of school books had aspects other than the educational aspect. There were numerous interests, as appears from the material before us\u2014some of them, no doubt, powerful\u2014which did not welcome the views of the Chief Superintendent and Council, who, shortly after the Act of 1846, published a list of recommended books. Indeed, notwithstanding the recommendations of the Council, and the provisions of the law designed to bring about the observance of such recommendations, unrecommended text\u2011books continued to be used for many years; and it was not until twenty years after the passing of the Act of 1846 that the Council, being satisfied that the policy of uniformity of text\u2011books had won a \u201ccommon consent\u201d in the province, felt itself warranted in declaring that all books other than those recommended were disapproved. As late as 1866, a most determined effort was made by a well known publishing house in Great Britain, represented by Canadian publishers and backed by most powerful Canadian influences, to bring about the abrogation of this system, and a reversion to the old plan of the Acts of 1841 and 1843, by which the choice of text-books for each school was left to the local board of trustees.\nIt is hardly surprising, therefore, that when, in 1850, a Bill to consolidate and re-enact the School Law was introduced into the Legislature, the clause in the earlier statute of 1846, defining in carefully selected words the special r\u00f4le of the Council, in the matter of text-books, was left unaltered, or that it remained unaltered down to the date of Confederation. In view of all these considerations I can perceive little to recommend it in the argument that the presence of clause 5 justifies the inference contended for.\nI am not suggesting that under clause 5 there is no authority to regulate. In disapproving of a text-book or list of text-books, the Council executes a power of disallowance under the sanction of a grave penalty, and is, of course, exercising a power of regulation; a power to make a rule, of a defined character, it is true, but still a rule, governing the use of text-books in schools. In recommending, also, the Council, by naming a book or books recommended, creates a situation from which, by force of other sections, duties arise that are incumbent upon the local authorities and officials responsible for the execution of the Act. Sections 27 (18), 79 (15), 91 (6), 98 (3).\nThe recommendations of the Council, once made, become, by force of these other sections, rules binding on local authorities and officials in the sense that their discretion is thereby limited; although s. 119 does not, in entrusting the Council with the duty of recommending, confer, ex proprie vigore, a power to prescribe; and, as already observed, the power to disallow is a power to regulate which can be executed only in a limited specified way.\nAnd here we may conveniently examine the contention of the appellants that s. 26 of the Act of 1863 does not extend to the subject of text-books. I will not for this purpose dwell upon the view sketched above, according to which this section gives a general power of regulation, subject only to relevant enactments of the separate school law, and to the limitations necessarily implied in the fact that the power is given for the purpose of enabling Roman Catholics to carry on more satisfactorily their system of denominational schools; and that, at least, that section subordinates such schools to regulation by the Council in respect of all subject matters, which may from time to time fall within the ambit of its jurisdiction in relation to common schools.\nI shall assume, for the present, that section 26 authorizes only such regulations as the Council might, at the date of the Act of 1863 have put into force under their existing powers in relation to common schools\u2014but assuming that, I can discover no satisfactory reason for denying that such an authority would embrace the power to make recommendations as to text-books, and to disallow such text-books under clause 5 of the Act of 1859. I shall not repeat what I have said as to clause 5, I can think of no reason for excluding\u2014under the construction contended for\u2014the authority given by that clause from the power of regulation which is the subject of section 26.\nSection 9 of the Separate Schools Act must not be overlooked. By that section trustees of such schools \u201cshall perform the same duties and be subject to the same penalties as the trustees of Common Schools.\u201d There is no exception of the duties incumbent upon common school trustees under sections 27 (18) and 79 (15).\nI have said that the view above stated as to the jurisdiction of the Council under the statutes of 1850 and 1859 (and incidentally, of the argument of the appellants that under those statutes the local boards of trustees were invested with completely autonomous powers in relation to the courses of study to be pursued in their several municipalities and school sections) was the view which dictated the practice adopted by the Council and the Chief Superintendent in executing their duties under those statutes.\nThis is demonstrable from the documents in evidence. In 1855, a manual was published under the authority of the Council for the guidance of \u201ctrustees, teachers and local superintendents,\u201d giving the statutes of 1850 and 1853 (the Grammar Schools Act), \u201ctogether with the forms, general regulations and instructions\u201d for executing the provisions of those statutes. The publication was issued, no doubt, pursuant to the duty of the Chief Superintendent under section 35 (3) of the Act of 1850, which required him to \u201ccause forms, instructions and general regulations of the Council to be printed from time to time,\u201d and distributed for the information of the officers of common schools; and the manual included \u201cgeneral regulations for the organization, government and discipline of the common schools of Canada\u201d as well as a programme of studies entitled \u201cThe Order and Classification of Studies for the Common Schools in Upper Canada.\u201d Again, in a similar publication, issued under the authority of the Council, in 1861, and edited by the Deputy Superintendent of Schools, there appears the same programme, which is described as the \u201cOrder and Classification of Studies Prescribed for the Common Schools of Upper Canada, as observed in the Upper Canada Model Schools, Toronto,\u201d and it is stated that this programme had been adopted by the Council on the 31st December, 1858.\nThis programme directs, or at all events assumes, that the pupils are to be classified in three divisions, and it is stated that, in the Model Schools, pupils in these divisions are arranged in five classes, corresponding to the five reading books of the Irish National Series of Readers, which had been recommended by the Council. In the manual of the same description, published in 1864, compiled by the same editor, this programme again appears. It is not without importance to notice that certain subjects\u2014trigonometry and some of the physical sciences\u2014are given in this curriculum as \u201cextra\u201d subjects, which may be taught at the discretion of the school authorities, but not more than one in any single term. Still again, in a manual printed for the Council in 1863, after the enactment of the Separate Schools Act of that year, this same programme is reproduced and it is there said to be applicable to separate schools.\nNo inconsiderable weight attaches to these publications, issued successively under the authority of the Council, in the years 1856, 1861, 1863 and 1864, as indicating the view accepted by the Department as to the powers of the Council, and carried out with circumstances of the greatest publicity. It is impossible to suppose, moreover, that those responsible for the legislation of 1859 were ignorant of the proceedings of the Council. We have already seen that the enactments of the Act of 1850 touching the powers of the Council were reproduced without pertinent change in the Act of 1859; and it seems to be a fair inference from this, taken together with the unqualified language of s. 26 of the Act of 1863, as well as of s. 9 of that statute, that the Council had not misunderstood the scope of the powers with which it was intended to invest them. The Council, in professing to prescribe this programme of studies for the direction of those responsible for the conduct of the common schools, was assuming in the most public manner an over-riding authority in relation to such matters. In this the Legislature must be presumed to have acquiesced.\nThe appellants have not, I conclude, established their contention as to the autonomous jurisdiction of boards of trustees, and they fail equally, I think, in adducing satisfactory reasons for holding that, in scope of instruction, the common schools of 1867 were on the same footing as collegiate institutes, high schools or continuation schools to-day.\nThe system of public instruction, at Confederation, included a provincial university, grammar schools, a normal school with model school attached, common schools and separate schools, which, admittedly, for the present purpose, may be grouped with common schools.\nOn behalf of the appellants, it is argued that it was one of the functions of the common schools, at that date, to train pupils for entrance to the university and the learned professions, and for that purpose to provide the necessary instruction in Greek and Latin, mathematics and what were called the \u201chigher branches of English\u201d; that, in this respect, they were, in truth, co-ordinate with the grammar schools.\nThe Common Schools Act of 1859 nowhere defines in terms the scope of the instruction to be imparted in such schools, but the type of school contemplated by the common school legislation may be inferred with confidence from the school legislation as a whole, and the official acts of the Council of Public Instruction and the Chief Superintendent, who were mainly charged with the administration of the school law.\nObviously, for our present purpose, the qualifications of teachers, the provision made for training them, the programmes of studies, officially promulgated, the character of the authorized text-books, may supply useful indicia. The Council of Public Instruction, which was entrusted with the office of regulating the conduct of the grammar schools and with the management of the Normal School, was also charged with duty, as we have seen, of regulating the programmes of study and prescribing text-books for common schools, and of prescribing the qualifications of teachers of such schools.\nThe programmes of study promulgated by the Council are in evidence, so, also, are the regulations prescribing the qualifications of teachers. The programmes are not framed with the view of fitting pupils for the university, as at once appears from a comparison of the list of subjects taught with requirements for matriculation; the qualifications for teachers are just as plainly not designed to provide instruction for any but the most elementary schools, and of the Normal School training, it is sufficient to say that Latin and Greek find no place in the curriculum. But, most important of all, are the lists of text-books recommended by the Council of Public Instruction for the common schools.\nI have already mentioned that it was the duty of the local authorities to provide the schools with authorized text-books, and to see that no unauthorized books were used. It is true, as already observed, that there was, for years, much laxity in the enforcement of these rules, but it is beyond doubt that the school books necessary for effective instruction of pupils reading for matriculation in the university or for entrance into the learned professions, could not, if the law were observed, be used in commons schools, at any time after 1847, when the first list of recommended books was sanctioned; and, after the year 1866, the use of a text-book in Latin or Greek, in a common school, would, by force of the regulation passed in that year, have entailed the loss of the government grant.\nThe position of the grammar schools in the system is also of considerable significance. The Grammar School Act of 1853 required each grammar school to make provision for instruction in the higher branches of a \u201cpractical English Education\u201d in Latin, Greek and mathematics, so as to prepare students for the University of Toronto.\nGrammar schools had been established long before, but the object of this Act was to cause them to take their proper place as intermediate schools between the common schools and the University. The Chief Superintendent repeatedly emphasizes the relative status of the two systems of schools. \u201cThe Grammar School should be a connecting link between the common schools and the University; the common schools should be the feeders of the grammar schools, and these should be the feeders of the University\u201d (Report for 1850, p. 22). Such expressions occur frequently in the reports in evidence. In 1865, after the enactment of the Grammar School Act of that year, Dr. Ryerson addressed a number of circulars to local authorities explaining the object of the new statute, 19 Doc. History, pp. 41, 42, 43 and 44 (Exhibit 46). \u201cThe object of the Act is to make Grammar Schools what they were intended to be * * * intermediate schools between the Common Schools and University College * * * prepare pupils for matriculation in the university\u2014to impart to others the higher branches of an English education, including the elements of French.\u201d These schools are not, he says \u201cin any way the rivals of common schools, nor permitted to do common school work * * * but a higher educational work which can be done by neither the common school on the one hand, nor by the College on the other.\u201d \u201cThe object of the Act,\u201d he says, \u201cis to make your grammar school what it ought to be, a High School for your City\u2014an intermediate school between common schools and the University\u201d, and pro- viding a higher \u201cEnglish\u201d education for those not desirous of studying Greek and Latin. \u201cThey are,\u201d he says, not to \u201cpoach upon common school ground,\u201d but to provide instruction supplementary to the \u201celementary\u201d education of the common schools. The Act of 1865 and the new programme of studies under it, together with the regulations already mentioned, disallowing for common schools all text-books not recommended by the Council (a regulation having the effect of excluding grammar school subjects from the common schools, under penalty of loss of the government grant) finally marked in a decisive way the distinction between the respective r\u00f4les of the two classes of schools. The high schools and collegiate institutes of to-day are the decendants of the grammar schools, the \u201cpublic schools\u201d of the common schools.\nIt seems necessary to refer to the mass of quotations from the Chief Superintendent\u2019s reports adduced by the appellants for the purpose of shewing that common schools were subject in the matter of courses of study to the exclusive control of the boards of trustees, and in support of the contention, I have just been considering.\nIn reading these extracts, it is important, first of all, to remember that local autonomy was the rule for some years, and that it was only in 1850 that the Council received general powers of regulation; and, most important of all perhaps, that even in the vital matter of text-books it took years to bring the practice into conformity with the regulations. Then extracts, separated from the context, are apt to mislead.\nI shall mention only a few of the passages quoted.\nIn his report for the year 1847, Dr. Ryerson states that there were, in that year, in Upper Canada, forty-one common schools in which Latin and Greek were taught, seventy, French, and seventy-seven, the elements of natural philosophy; 1847 being the year in which the first list of recommended books was published, a list not including a text-book in any of these subjects. The figures produced are in themselves of little value, but the change which occurs in a few years is important. By 1852, the last year for which the figures are available, seven schools were teaching Latin and two Greek. In the report of the year 1867, there is a significant statement. In that year, it appears from a table in the appendix, that in none of the cities (and these include Hamilton and London) were any text-books but authorized text-books in use\u2014the result, perhaps, of the regulation, above mentioned, of 1866. Mr. Hellmuth, naturally enough, dwelt with some emphasis upon the report of the local Inspector for Hamilton for 1853, and that for London in 1863, as giving two conspicuous instances of common schools engaged in training pupils for matriculation in the University, and maintaining efficient clases in Latin, Greek and French. In 1867, as the report shews, this had ceased. I refer to one more extract. It is from a circular of the Chief Superintendent in the year 1847. In this circular, addressed to mayors of cities and towns, he appears to say that the local board of trustees is to determine (inter alia) \u201cThe subjects of instruction and the text-books to be used in each school\u201d and this passage is adduced as supporting the appellants\u2019 contention as to the powers of boards of trustees. A circular issued a month later shews that, as to text-books, the Chief Superintendent only meant to say that trustees were entitled to select text-books from a list recommended by the Provincial Board of Education.\nAs to subjects of instruction, this circular was issued before the Act of 1850, in which clause 4 of section 119 of the Act of 1859 conferring on the Council, for the first time, general powers of regulation, first appeared.\nMy conclusion, after examining these extracts, with some attention, is that when read with due regard to date and context, and to the circumstances in which they were published, they afford little support to the appellants.\nAs against the argument the appellants seek to found upon these passages from a communication of 1847, may be set the official acts of the Council is prescribing programmes of studies, and the following passage from a letter published in March, 1866:\nOf private schools and their teachers, the law takes no note; but the Legislature, that provides by law funds for the support of public schools, has the undoubted right of prescribing the condition on which such schools shall be entitled to public aid. The Legislature has invested a body called the Council of Public Instruction, with the power and imposed upon it the duty to prescribe the subjects of instruction in the public schools, and the text-books, which shall be used in giving that instruction. A teacher of a public school is not, therefore, employed to teach what subjects and books which he pleases but to teach those subjects and books which are provided by law, and no school is entitled to public aid which is not conducted according to law.\n* * *\nThe Legislature has authorized the Council of Public Instruction to prescribe and sanction text-books for the national schools, and to prohibit the use of others; and every school corporation and county boards are required to select text-books from the authorized list of such books; and if any such Board has recommended any text-book not in the authorized list, it has acted without authority and has violated the third clause of the Common School Act. With the law-abiding people, the law should be supreme.\nOn the first branch of the appeal, therefore, the appellants fail.\nThe appellants\u2019 claim in relation to the public grants rests upon s. 20 of the Act of 1863.\nThe principle of division laid down by that section assumes the existence of a fund, which has been appropriated for the benefit of the common schools generally in each municipality. It is upon this fund, so appropriated for a given municipality, that the section operates. The Act of 1863 contains no provision for the distribution among municipalities of public moneys granted for school purposes. In the absence of some specific appropriation it is necessary to resort to the provisions of the Act of 1859 to ascertain the fund in which, under s. 20, a given separate school is to share.\nThat statute deals with the distribution of moneys voted for common school purposes in sections 106, 120, 121 and 122. These sections enact, in effect, that moneys annually granted, in aid of common schools, shall, after providing for certain specific appropriations set forth in s. 120, and for any other express appropriations, be divided among the municipalities, according to population. The fund for each municipality having been thus ascertained, s. 20 comes into play.\nIt seems quite clear that the Legislature did not intend to tie its hands by s. 106 (1) in such a way as to necessitate the apportionment of all moneys voted for common schools, according to a fixed arithmetical ratio. The qualification \u201cnot otherwise expressly appropriated\u201d sufficiently manifests the intention of the Legislature to reserve its freedom of action. A special appropriation directing the disbursement of moneys voted for the common schools on a different principle would, therefore, have involved in point of law no departure from or inconsistency with s. 106 or s. 20, and this applies to the methods of distribution now attacked. The fact that they are laid down in a general Act is, of course, immaterial.\nAssuming s. 20 to have created a legal \u201cright or privilege\u201d within the meaning of s. 93 (1), it was not, and in the nature of things could not be, a right \u201cby law\u201d to require the Legislature to refrain from granting appropriations for special purposes or for the aid of schools reaching a certain standard of excellence or of school sections conforming to a certain standard of expenditure.\nTo none of the appropriations affected by the rules of apportionment, to which the appellants object, could a claim have been made under that section, or under that section combined with s. 106. The appellants have been deprived of nothing to which any \u201cright or privilege,\u201d under those sections, could attach.\nIt may be said that although strictly the \u201cright or privilege\u201d in itself is not prejudiced by the legislation impeached, it is nevertheless rendered less valuable thereby. But, assuming that to be a legitimate ground of complaint, under s. 93 (1), there is no evidence of such prejudice, as affecting either the Roman Catholics as a whole or the representative plaintiffs. There is not the slightest reason for supposing that the existing grants, if distributed according to the arithmetical ratios of s. 106 and s. 20, would yield a larger sum for Roman Catholics as a whole. But, more important still, it is impossible to know (if under compulsion of a constitutional limitation, the Legislature were obliged to follow an unwise and wasteful plan of distribution) whether the grants would be as generous as they now are, under a system designed to ensure a fruitful expenditure. There is, of course, no suggestion that by the statutes now in force, separate schools are placed upon a footing of inequality with the public schools. Grants are shared by all schools alike, upon identical conditions.\nDuring the argument it was suggested that it was not competent to the appellants by means of a Petition of Right to obtain (as they are attempting to do) a declaration that certain statutes of the Ontario Legislature are ultra vires. The question is important, and the appellants\u2019 right to maintain their petition in its present form is not at all free from doubt. The Attorney-General, however, is content to have the questions raised passed upon in the present proceedings, and no such objection has been taken by him at any stage. A speedy determination of those questions is, moreover, obviously desirable in the wider public interest, and, in the circumstances, it would appear that the Court is not under a duty to consider the technical question, upon which no opinion is pronounced.\nThe appeal should be dismised.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014Three claims, which are thus summarized by the Chief Justice, are advanced on behalf of the appellants:\u2014\n(A) Their claim \u201cto establish and conduct courses of study and grades of education in Catholic separate schools such as are now conducted in continuation schools, collegiate institutes and high schools\u201d; and that \u201call regulations purporting to prohibit, limit or in any way prejudicially affect such right or privilege are invalid and ultra vires\u201d;\n(B) Their claim to exemption from taxation for the support of continuation schools, collegiate institutes and high schools not conducted by their own boards of trustees;\n(C) Their claim to a share in public moneys granted by the Legislature of the Province of Ontario \u201cfor common school purposes\u201d computed in accordance with what they assert to have been their statutory rights at the date of Confederation.\nAs to claims (A) and (B), I fully accept the judgment of the Chief Justice, and I feel that I cannot usefully add anything to what he has said in allowing these two claims. It seems to me inconceivable that when it granted to the Roman Catholics of Upper Canada the privilege of having their own separate schools, the Legislature could have intended to render this privilege valueless by allowing the Council of Public Instruction of that Province to restrict, by regulations, the scope of the education to be given in these schools. The educational systems both of Ontario and Quebec were established by the same Legislature, and it is a matter of common knowledge that in Quebec the religious minority of that province has always had full control of its own schools, including its high schools. To my very great regret, however, I find myself unable to accept in its entirety the decision of the Chief Justice with regard to the third claim. As briefly as possible, I will explain wherein my views differ from those of my Lord.\nThe appellants\u2019 case must be that a right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which the class of persons whom they represent had by law in the province at the Union has been prejudicially affected by the legislation of which they complain.\nThe crucial question therefore is: what was the right or privilege which this class of persons had by law at the Union to claim for their separate schools a share of public moneys granted by the Legislature for the support of common schools or for common school purposes? To answer this question, reference must be had to sections 20, 21 and 22 of the Separate Schools Act of 1863 (26 Vict., c. 5) which reads as follows:\u2014\n20. Every Separate School shall be entitled to a share in the fund annually granted by the Legislature of this Province for the support of Common Schools, and shall be entitled also to a share in all other public grants, investments and allotments for Common School purposes now made or hereafter to be made by the Province or the Municipal authorities, according to the average number of pupils attending such school during the twelve next preceding months, or during the number of months which may have elapsed from the establishment of a new Separate School, as compared with the whole average number of pupils attending School in the same City, Town, Village or Township.\n21. Nothing herein contained shall entitle any such Separate School within any City, Town, Incorporated Village or Township, to any part or portion of school moneys arising or accruing from local assessment for Common School purposes within the City, Town, Village or Township, or the County or Union of Counties within which the City, Town, Village or Township is situate.\n22. The Trustees of each Separate School shall, on or before the thirtieth day of June, and the thirty-first day of December of every year, transmit to the Chief Superintendent of Education for Upper Canada, a correct return of the names of the children attending such school, together with the average attendance during the six next preceding months, or during the number of months which have elapsed since the establishment thereof, and the number of months it has been so kept open; and the Chief Superintendent shall, thereupon, determine the proportion which the Trustees of such Separate School are entitled to receive out of the Legislative grant, and shall pay over the amount thereof to such Trustees.\nThere is no difficulty, nor is any complaint made, as to the distribution between common (or public) schools and separate schools of the Common School Fund, which s. 20 describes as \u201cthe fund annually granted by the Legislature of this Province for the support of common schools\u201d.\nThe point on which, with great deference, I have been unable to agree with the Chief Justice is with respect to the character, either general, or both general and special, of \u201call other public grants, investments and allotments for common school purposes\u201d, of which, under s. 20, \u201cevery separate school\u201d is entitled to a share.\nIn other words, what is the meaning and effect of the following language of s. 20: \u201cEvery separate school * * * shall be entitled also to a share in all other public grants, investments and allotments for common school purposes now made or hereafter to be made by the Province or the municipal authorities\u201d?\nSections 20, 21 and 22 of the Separate Schools Act of 1863, I think, must be read with section 106 of the Common Schools Act of 1859, Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, 1859, chapter 64.\nSection 106 is a long section, but I need specially refer only to subsection 1, the effect of which is to empower the Chief Superintendent of Education to apportion annually, on or before the first day of May, all moneys granted or provided by the Legislature for the support of common schools in Upper Canada, and not otherwise appropriated by law, to the several counties, townships, cities, towns and incorporated villages according to the ratio of population in each as compared with the whole population of Upper Canada.\nConsistently with this enactment, s. 20 of the Separate Schools Act of 1863 states that every separate school shall be entitled to a share in the fund annually granted by the Legislature of the Province for the support of common schools, and shall be entitled also to a share in all other public grants, investments and allotments for common school purposes now made or hereafter to be made by the Province or the municipal authorities, according to the average number of pupils attending such school during the twelve next preceding months * * * as compared with the whole average number of pupils attending school in the same city, town, village or township. That is to say, the Chief Superintendent, as directed by s. 106 of the Common Schools Act of 1859, having apportioned all moneys granted or provided by the Legislature for the support of common schools in Upper Canada, and not otherwise appropriated by law, to the several counties, townships, cities, towns and incorporated villages according to the ratio of population in each as compared with the whole population of Upper Canada, every separate school is entitled to share in the amount thus apportioned, according to the average number of pupils attending such school during the twelve next preceding months, as compared with the whole average number of pupils attending school in the same city, town, village or township.\nConsistently also, s. 22 of the Separate Schools Act of 1863, after requiring the trustees of each separate school to transmit twice annually a correct return of the names of the children attending such school, together with the average attendance during the six next preceding months, directs that the Chief Superintendent shall, thereupon, determine the proportion which the trustees of such separate school are entitled to receive out of the legislative grant, and shall pay over the amount thereof to such trustees. The trustees thus receive the share of the legislative grant to which their separate school is entitled from the Chief Superintendent, and the latter, in his apportionment, cannot apportion moneys otherwise appropriated by law.\nIn my opinion, the legislative grant which the Chief Superintendent apportions, and of which he subsequently pays a share to the trustees of each separate school, is a general grant for the support of common schools or for common school purposes. A special grant, say for the rebuilding of a particular school destroyed by fire, would be otherwise appropriated by law, and the Chief Superintendent could not deal with it in his apportionment. Section 20 of the Separate Schools Act places legislative grants on the same footing as municipal grants, and I cannot understand how the latter could be apportioned among the common and separate schools of the municipality unless they also are general grants.\nSection 20, as I read it, embodies an undertaking, which is now binding on the Legislature of the Province of Ontario by virtue of s. 93, sub-s. 1, of the British North America Act, that there should be then or thereafter no discrimination against the separate schools with regard to the common school fund and \u201call other public grants, investments and allotments for common school purposes\u201d. The grants, investments and allotments contemplated must have been of a general character, for \u201cevery separate school,\u201d as explained above, was entitled to claim a share therein. If the Legislature, after the passing of the Separate Schools Act of 1863, made such a grant, investment or allotment for common school purposes, no new enactment was required to entitle \u201cevery separate school\u201d to a share therein, and in that sense there existed, at the Union, a \u201cright or privilege by law\u201d which could have been enforced before the courts. But, in my judgment, nothing in s. 20 would have entitled \u201cevery separate school\u201d to claim a share in a grant made in favour of a particular common school. If, for instance, to refer again to the same illustration, the Legislature had granted $10,000 to rebuild a school in the city of Ottawa which had been destroyed by fire, it is to me inconceivable that \u201cevery separate school\u201d in Ottawa could have asserted a claim, under s. 20, to a share in such a grant. Such special grants cannot be said to be grants \u201cfor common school purposes\u201d within the meaning of s. 20. The generality of the apportionment contemplated, I think, indicates the generality of the grants which were to be apportioned among the common and separate schools respectively.\nThe appellants seem to concede this point. In their factum, they say:\nIt may be that a grant by the Legislature towards the rebuilding of a school that has been destroyed by fire, or something of a like nature, might be construed not to be a grant for common school purposes. * * *\nThere is indeed an obvious distinction between a particular common school purpose, and common school purposes generally. It may be further observed that the whole context of s. 20 shews that both the Common School Fund and the other public grants referred to were general in their character, and were made in favour of all common and separate schools, since all of them participated therein. This admittedly was true of the Common School Fund, and I see no reason for doubting that the other public grants contemplated were also general grants. This is further shewn by the extract from the supply bill of 1865, at page 125 of the Appendix of Statutes. The grants for common schools thereby made were general grants. I think we have here an illustration of the contemporaneous practice at or near the time when these statutes were enacted.\nIt is said that the Legislature of Ontario may evade the obligation which results from s. 20 by the simple device of making special grants to each public school designated by its name. That a power may conceivably be abused is, however, no reason for denying its existence if it be clearly granted by law. But I do not think we should assume that this power to make special grants will be abused. The obligation undertaken by the Province, and rendered intangible by s. 93 of the British North America Act, is one of the safeguards stipulated by the religious minorities both of Quebec and of Ontario. It is even more than a legal obligation, it is, if I may say so, an obligation binding in honour. And I cannot assume that it will be deliberately evaded in the manner suggested.\nIn full agreement with the Chief Justice, I may add that conditions in excess of those laid down by s. 20 of the Separate Schools Act of 1863 cannot, in my opinion, be imposed on the separate schools in order to entitle them to obtain a share in the grants to which the section applies. That section is still in force and cannot be changed by the Legislature. I also agree that any statute which purports to impose such conditions, as well as all statutes and regulations which are in contravention of claims (A) and (B) of the appellants, are ultra vires.\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The suppliants, the board of trustees of the Roman Catholic separate schools for school section no.2 in the township of Tiny, and the board of trustees of the Roman Catholic separate schools for the city of Peterboro, on behalf of themselves and the other boards of trustees of Roman Catholic separate schools in the province of Ontario, claim, by their amended petition of right,\n(1) Payment of the sum of $736 to the first named board, that being the sum to which, under the Act of the former Province of Canada respecting Separate Schools, c. 5, of 1863, s. 20, the board claims to be entitled for the year 1922 in excess of that which it has received.\n(2) That it may be declared that certain Acts or parts of Acts of the legislature of Ontario respecting education, which are enumerated, and which were enacted in 1871 and subsequently, prejudicially affect the rights or privileges of the suppliants as claimed to have been conferred by the Separate Schools Act of 1863 and secured by s. 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, and that these provincial enactments are ultra vires in so far as they affect the rights of the suppliants.\n(3) That it may be declared that the suppliants have the right to establish and conduct courses of study and grades of education such as are now conducted in the continuation schools, collegiate institutes and high schools of Ontario, and that any and all regulations purporting to prohibit, or in any way prejudicially to affect, such right are ultra vires.\n(4) That it may be declared that the supporters of Roman Catholic separate schools are exempt from the payment of rates imposed for the support of the continuation schools, collegiate institutes and high schools not established or conducted by the suppliants or other boards of trustees of Roman Catholic separate schools.\n(5) Such further or other relief as may be requisite.\nThe petition was dismissed at the trial, and the judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division, from which it comes to this Court.\nI agree that the appeal should be dismissed and with the reasons for that result which are expressed by my brother Duff, but perhaps I may usefully add the following.\nI am satisfied that, even if the procedure by petition of right were available for the trial of the issues which the parties have presented, the suppliants\u2019 case must fail in all particulars. I shall consider presently the first claim of the petition, by which it is sought to recover the sum of $736. But, as to the other branch of the case, relating to the field within which a right is said to be secured to the trustees of the Roman Catholic separate schools of Ontario to carry on these schools, one cannot read the Statutes of 1859 and 1863 and the earlier Statutes, which must be read together, without realizing that the trustees are not at large, and that there were powers of regulation existing in the legislature at the time of the Union, and which were then carried forward, by the exercise of which the separate schools, equally with the common schools, were to be regulated and governed. The Council of Public Instruction had the comprehensive power, conferred by section 119, clause 4, of the Act of 1859,\nto make such regulations from time to time as it deems expedient for the organization, government and discipline of Common Schools, for the clarification of schools and teachers, and for school libraries throughout Canada.\nAnd, when, by the Act of 1863, provision was made for the establishment and conduct of the Roman Catholic separate schools, it was declared by s. 26 that they\nshall be subject to such inspection as may be directed from time to time by the Chief Superintendent of Education, and shall be subject also to such regulations as may be imposed from time to time by the Council of Public Instruction for Upper Canada.\nI have examined carefully the post-Union Statutes and Regulations of which the suppliants complain, but I am unable to perceive that any of these operates prejudically to affect any right or privilege which the suppliants, or the class of persons they represent, had by law in the province at the Union. If these provisions had been prescribed by the Council of Public Instruction previously to the Union, there could have been no sound objection to their validity, and the powers of regulation which, within the scope of the Acts of 1859 and 1863, the province possessed at the Union were not reduced by the British North America Act. The denominational schools to which s. 93 (1) refers, so far as they were Roman Catholic separate schools of Upper Canada, were regulated schools, and I do not doubt that the provisions to which the suppliants object are within the powers of regulation which the Province had in 1863, and continued to possess at and after the Union.\nWith regard to the $736, that is claimed as part of the appropriations sanctioned by the legislature in aid of the schools for the year 1922. But the money appears to have been applied in the manner authorized by the Statutes as expressed, and I can find no sanction for diverting any part of it to a different purpose. There is nothing in the British North America Acts to compel the legislature to make a grant, or to avoid conditions prescribed for earning it, or to prevent a specific appropriation. Therefore, to put cases which appear to be very plain and simple, if the grant be for the sole benefit of one of the common schools, or if it be payable only to those schools which comply with a condition, for example, that they have a specified attendance, or a certain standard of efficiency, it is nevertheless an effective grant, and it would require the authority of the legislature to direct that it shall be shared by other schools, or by those which do not comply with the legislative conditions imposed.\nIt is said in effect, and this branch of the case depends upon the proposition, that, when such a grant is made, the board of trustees of a Roman Catholic separate school has, by force of the legislation as it stood at the Union, and by the effect of s. 93 (1) of the British North America Act, 1867, a legal right or privilege to enforce against the Provincial Government payment of a share of the grant in the proportion of the average number of pupils attending that separate school to the whole average number attending school in the same city, town, village or township; and, strangely enough, that contention is put alongside of another which maintains that the Special Act, or the Act which imposes the condition, is ultra vires of the legislature. I can understand, although I cannot justify, the latter suggestion. It involves the argument that legislative capacity for the grant in question has been withheld. But I confess I do not see how it is that, if, as must be the case, the authority of the legislature is necessary to the making of a grant, that grant can operate for a purpose which was not authorized by the provisions which sanction it. The court cannot take the place of the legislature to make a grant. The British North America Act has been productive of some results which perhaps were not anticipated, but it has not, I am persuaded, created anything so difficult of conception as a present legal right to share in a future legislative grant, and still less when the grant is by its terms not shareable, nor capable of distribution in the manner claimed. Therefore in this particular also the petition must fail, whether its object be to enforce payment of the $736, or to obtain a declaration of the invalidity of the grants.\nRINFRET J. concurs with Anglin C.J.C.\nLAMONT J.\u2014The question for determination in this appeal is whether certain legislation enacted by the Legislature of the Province of Ontario was beyond the power of the Legislature to enact.\nFor the appellants it is contended that it was; that it amounted to a contravention of s. 93 (1) of the British North America Act of 1867. That section reads as follows:\u2014\n93. In and for each Province the Legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to education, subject and according to the following provisions:\u2014\n(1) Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons have by law in the Province at the Union.\u201d\nThe particular respects in which the appellants contend that their rights were invaded by the impeached legislation, are:\u2014\n1. That it takes away the right of the Roman Catholics to have taught in their separate schools all the courses of study and subjects of instruction which are now being taught in the continuation schools, collegiate institutes and high schools of Ontario and that as a consequence thereof the Roman Catholic ratepayers are taxed for the support of these institutions, from which taxation they should be exempt.\n2. That it altered the basis of the annual grants made by the Legislature for public school purposes in a manner which prejudicially affects the share thereof which each separate school is entitled to receive.\nThe argument on behalf of the appellants on the first branch of the case, briefly put, is as follows: That prior to Confederation the Roman Catholics of Ontario had, by law, the right to have their denominational schools managed by trustees of their own faith and choosing; that, as part of the management thereof, the trustees of each separate school had the right to prescribe the courses of study to be taught in their school; that this right was confirmed to them by s. 93 (1), above quoted, and, as a consequence of such confirmation the Legislature after Confederation was powerless to validly impose any restriction or limitation upon their said right, or to prevent the trustees of such schools from causing to be taught therein all the subjects now being taught in the continuation schools, collegiate institutes and high schools. That these institutions are to-day teaching only the subjects taught in the common schools prior to Confederation, and, as by law separate school supporters are exempt from contributing to the support of common schools, they are exempt from contributing to the support of institutions doing common school work. What we have to ascertain in the first place, therefore, is: Did the trustees of the separate schools at Confederation have an unqualified and unfettered right by law to prescribe the courses of study to be taught in their schools. If so the legislation impeached in this action is an infringement of that right and, therefore, invalid.\nThe rights and privileges in respect to denominational schools which the Roman Catholics of Ontario had by law at Confederation, were those given to them by the Act of 1863 (26 Vict., c. 5). Section 2 of that Act provided that any number of persons, not less than five, and being heads of families and Roman Catholics, might convene a public meeting of persons desiring to establish a separate school for Roman Catholics and for the election of trustees thereof. Section 3 provided for the election of three of such persons present to act as trustees \u201cfor the management of such separate school\u201d. The trustees were declared to be a body corporate and to have power to impose, levy and collect school rates from persons sending children to or subscribing toward the support of such schools, but persons paying rates to separate schools were declared exempt from contributing to the support of the common schools. In addition the trustees were to have all the powers in respect of separate schools that the trustees of common schools had and possessed under the Act relating to common schools (s. 7). It was also enacted that the trustees of separate schools should perform the same duties and be subject to the same penalties as the trustees of common schools (s. 9). Then s. 26 reads as follows:\u2014\n26. The Roman Catholic Separate Schools (with their Registers) shall be subject to such inspection, as may be directed from time to time, by the Chief Superintendent of Education, and shall be subject also, to such regulations as may be imposed, from time to time, by the Council of Public Instruction for Upper Canada.\nTurning now to the Act respecting Common Schools (C.S.U.C. 1859, c. 64) we find therein set out the powers, duties and obligations of the trustees of common schools (ss. 27 and 79). There it is expressly stated to be the duty of the trustees to see that the schools under their charge were conducted according to the authorized regulations and to see that no unauthorized text books were used.\nBy s. 119 (4) it was expressly declared to be the duty of the Council of Public Instruction\nTo make such regulations from time to time, as it deems expedient, for the organization, government and discipline of Common Schools, for the classification of Schools and Teachers, and for School Libraries throughout Upper Canada.\nDoes the authority to make regulations for the \u201corganization, government, discipline and classification\u201d of schools, include authority to make regulations prescribing the courses of study to be taught therein? The language of the section is, it seems to me, sufficiently wide to cover such authority. Furthermore, both before 1859 and afterwards until Confederation, the Council of Public Instruction had not only been in existence with the duty and authority set out in s. 119 (4), but, acting under that authority, had prescribed the courses of study in the common schools. This shows that prior to Confederation it was understood and accepted that the Council\u2019s authority to make regulations, for the common schools embraced that of prescribing the studies to be taught therein. Then again the history of the legislation is instructive:\nUnder the Common Schools Act of 1841 (4-5 Vic., c. 18) it was the duty of the trustees (then called commissioners):\nTo regulate for each school, respectively, the course of study to be followed in such school, and the books to be used therein, and to establish general rules for the conduct of the Schools.\nAt that date the local authorities had an unrestricted control over the courses of study. Two years later, however, a restriction was placed upon their powers. By 7 Vict. c. 29 (1843), it was declared to be the duty of the trustees To regulate for such School the course of study, and the books to be used therein, and to establish general rules; subject, nevertheless, to the approval of the Township, Town or City Superintendent.\nThis Superintendent was appointed by the council of the township, town or city.\nUnder this Act the power to prescribe the courses of study could only be exercised by the joint concurrence of the trustees and the local superintendent. But although this Act restricted the control of the trustees there was, as yet, no attempt at central control.\nIn 1846 (9 Vict., c. 20) it was enacted that the Governor might appoint a fit and proper person to be superintendent of schools in Upper Canada, whose duty it was to be\nTo prepare suitable forms and regulations for making all Reports, and conducting all necessary proceedings under this Act, and to cause the same, with such instructions as he shall deem necessary and proper for the better organization and government of Common Schools, to be transmitted to the Officers required to execute the provisions of this Act. * * *\nSection 27 of the Act provides as follows:\u2014\nAnd be it enacted, that it shall be the duty of the Trustees of each School section: * * * To see that the School is conducted according to the regulations herein provided for; * * *\nA comparision of the Acts of 1843 and 1846 shews that in both Acts the duties of the trustees are set out at length, but, while in the Act of 1843 express authority was given to the trustees to prescribe the courses of study, with the consent of the local superintendent, no such authority appears in the Act of 1846; but in that Act it was declared to be the duty of the trustees to conduct their schools in accordance with the regulations therein provided for, which regulations were those authorized to be made by the Superintendent of Schools for Upper Canada for \u201cconducting all necessary proceedings under this Act.\u201d\nIn 1850 a further step was made by the appointment of the Council of Public Instruction with the powers set out in s. 119 (4), above quoted, which council took the place of the Superintendent of Upper Canada so far as the question under discussion is concerned.\nConsidering the wide language in which the authority of the Council of Public Instruction to make regulations is expressed, the course of the legislation and the practice prevailing over many years, I am of opinion that it was the intention of the Legislature prior to Confederation, in order to secure greater uniformity, to vest in the Council of Public Instruction authority to prescribe the courses of study for the common schools. That being so and the Roman Catholic separate schools being, by s. 26, expressly made subject to such regulations as might from time to time be imposed by the Council of Public Instruction, the trustees of each separate school at Confederation were in duty bound to see that their school carried out such programme of studies as the Council of Public Instruction might, by virtue of the authority vested in them to make regulations, impose.\nFor the appellants it was argued that, even if that were so, it was incumbent upon the Council of Public Instruction to exercise their authority and actually make regulations for separate schools before the right of the trustees to prescribe the studies would be displaced and that as, up to Confederation, no such regulations had been made, the effect of s. 93 (1) was to confirm the right of the trustees unfettered by any regulation which might afterwards be made.\nIn my opinion this contention cannot be supported, for even assuming (which is disputed) that up to Confederation no regulation as to the courses of study in separate schools had been made by the Council of Public Instruction, the authority of the Council to prescribe these courses by regulation was always there, and the right of the trustees was always subject thereto. It was the right of the trustees to manage their separate schools subject to the right of the Council to step in and make regulations relating (inter alia) to courses of study, that was confirmed by s. 93 (1).\nThe right of the Council to prescribe the subjects to be taught did not mean (as the appellants seem to fear) that in the exercise of the right the Council could, by forbidding the teaching of subjects beyond those required\u2014say for a Kindergarten class\u2014in effect destroy the separate schools. No authority, in my opinion, was ever given, either to the Superintendent of Upper Canada or to the Council of Public Instruction, to make regulations which would wipe out, wholly or in part, either the common or the separate schools. Prior to Confederation the Legislature could have done this, but after Confederation even the Legislature was powerless to abolish separate schools. The power bestowed upon the Council was to make regulations for the organization, government, discipline and classification of common schools. At Confederation the common schools had a distinct and definite place in the system of education of Upper Canada. They were to furnish the elementary instruction for the pupils of their respective school districts; while the grammar schools were to furnish instruction\nin all the higher branches of a practical English and Commercial Education, including the Elements of Natural Philosophy and Mechanics, and also in the Latin and Greek Languages and Mathematics so far as to prepare students for University College or any College affiliated to the University of Toronto. * * * (Grammar Schools Act, 1853 16 Vict., c. 186, s. 5.)\nAs was stated by the Chief Superintendent in a circular issued by him in 1866, the object of the Grammar School law was\nto make the Grammar Schools the High Schools of their respective localities\u2014intermediate schools between the Common Schools and the University, in arts, in law, and in the department of civil engineering, to give to intended surveyors their preliminary education, and to impart the higher branches of an English and commercial education to those youths whose parents do not wish them to study Greek and Latin.\nIn the educational system of Upper Canada the common schools were, therefore, intended to be the primary schools, with the grammar schools as intermediate schools between the common schools and the University. These were their respective fields, and the duty of the Council was to make regulations prescribing courses of study which would enable the schools to effectively provide instruction covering the field which the Legislature intended they should occupy, but not to destroy or limit their usefulness by restricting the field of their operations.\nIn the actual working out of the system no doubt there were common schools which taught subjects that were intended to be taught in the grammar schools, and, no doubt, some grammar schools gave instruction in subjects covered by the primary course, but this over\u2011lapping was, I think, due to the exigencies of the particular localities. It must not be forgotten that at that time the province was young and in process of being settled. Some settlements grew more rapidly than others, with the result that they required educational facilities beyond those which the common schools were intended to supply, before sufficient provision was made in these settlements for secondary education; while in other settlements, whatever may have been the cause thereof, the grammar schools, instead of confining themselves to the work of intermediate schools, were found to be furnishing instruction in subjects some of which belonged properly to the intermediate course, while others belonged to the elementary course of the common schools. It is not, however, to the manner in which the system worked out in actual practice that we must look for guidance in determining the sphere of operation of the primary and intermediate schools, but to the intention of the Legislature as disclosed in the various Acts.\nOnce we know the limits of the field which it was intended the common schools should occupy, we know the field to be covered by the separate schools, for, in my opinion, in so far as secular education was concerned the separate schools were intended to be simply common schools under denominational management.\nThe right of the Roman Catholics, however, to have separate schools carries with it, in my opinion, the right to have separate schools of the class of the common schools at Confederation, and covering the same field so far as secular education is concerned; that is to say, primary schools furnishing elementary instruction.\nThe line of demarcation between the primary and intermediate schools may not always have been definitely drawn or closely adhered to, for the reason that it was at times difficult to keep, or to induce the ratepayers to keep, the educational facilities up to the requirements of the respective localities, but I do not think it can reasonably be said that the separate schools of to-day under the impeached legislation have lost their status as primary schools of the class to which the Act of 1863 intended them to belong.\nThe appellants also relied upon s. 79 (8) of the Common Schools Act of 1859, which declared it to be the duty of the board of school trustees of every city, town and village\nTo determine the number, sites, kind and description of schools to be established and maintained in the city, town or village.\nThey contended that \u201ckind and description\u201d in this subsection meant the \u201cgrade or character\u201d of the school which would necessarily include the courses of study and branches of education taught therein, and they referred to the decision of the Privy Council in Ottawa Separate Schools Trustees v. Mackell[30], as supporting their contention.\nIn that case their Lordships, at page 71, say:\u2014\nThe \u201ckind\u201d of school referred to in sub-s. 8 of s. 79 is, in their opinion, the grade or character of school, for example, \u201ca girls\u2019 school,\u201d \u201ca boys\u2019 school,\u201d or \u201can infants\u2019 school,\u201d and a \u201ckind\u201d of school, within the meaning of that subsection, is not a school where any special language is in common use.\nBy the examples given their Lordships have indicated that the \u201ckind,\u201d \u201cgrade or character\u201d of a school which the trustees have a right to determine refers rather to the class of persons for whose education the school was to provide than to the courses of study to be taught in such school. The term, in my opinion, would also cover the right to determine whether the school should be a central, branch or ward school. I am, however, unable to find anything in the judgment which lends support to the appellants\u2019 contention that the \u201cgrade or character\u201d of the school implies a right to grade in the sense of prescribing the courses of study. The examples given, in my opinion, point to the opposite conclusion.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the impeached legislation so far as this branch of the case is concerned, does not prejudicially affect any right or privilege guaranteed to the separate schools by s. 93 (1) of the British North America Act, 1867.\nThis conclusion disposes of the further contention of the appellants that the Roman Catholic ratepayers were not liable to taxation for continuation schools, collegiate institutes and high schools.\nThe only exemption they had under the Act was that they should not be liable to contribute toward the support of common schools, that is, as I have said, schools furnishing elementary instruction.\nThe continuation schools, collegiate institutes and high schools under the legislation and regulations in force, all furnish instruction in matters pertaining to secondary edu- cation and they cannot, in my opinion, be classed as common schools. The Roman Catholic ratepayers are, therefore, not exempt from taxation for the support of these institutions.\nOn the other branch of the case the contention of the appellants is that the impeached legislation has altered to their prejudice the basis of distribution of legislative grants which prevailed at Confederation.\nThe right of a separate school to share in the legislative grants is governed by s. 20 of the Act of 1863. That section reads as follows:\u2014\n20. Every Separate School shall be entitled to a share in the fund annually granted by the Legislature of this Province for the support of Common Schools, and shall be entitled also to a share in all other public grants, investments and allotments for Common School purposes now made or hereafter to be made by the Province or the Municipal authorities, according to the average number of pupils attending such School during the twelve next preceding months, or during the number of months which may have elapsed from the establishment of a new Separate School, as compared with the whole average number of pupils attending school in the same City, Town, Village or Township.\nThe object of this section was to enable the separate schools to obtain a share of the legislative grants for common schools.\nIt will be observed that there is no obligation on the legislature to make any grant, but the section provides that such grants as the legislature shall make for common school purposes are to be distributed upon the basis set out in the section.\nThe difficulty, in my opinion, is not with the basis of distribution but in determining what moneys are to be deemed grants within the meaning of the section. As to the \u201cfund annually granted by the Legislature for the support of common schools\u201d, both respondent and appellants appear to be agreed that it relates to a fund known as the \u201cCommon School Fund\u201d concerning which no question arises in this litigation. It is as to the construction to be placed upon the words \u201call other public grants for common school purposes\u201d that the parties differ. To my mind the question involved, stated briefly, is: Are \u201cpublic grants * * * for common school purposes\u201d to be limited to general grants in which all schools are to share, or do they include grants made for a specific purpose or grants made conditional upon their being earned. The respondent contends that a grant for a specific purpose or a grant made conditional upon its being earned, is not a grant for common school purposes within the meaning of s. 20.\nThe contention of the appellants as set forth in their factum is as follows:\u2014\nIt may be that a grant by the Legislature towards the rebuilding of a school that has been destroyed by fire, or something of a like nature, might be construed not to be a grant for Common School purposes, but that a grant to Common, now called Public, Schools, dependent upon their attaining a certain standard of efficiency or equipment or raising a sufficient amount of money to pay expensive teachers, is not such a grant as will entitle the Roman Catholic Separate Schools to share in, is denied by the appellants, and it is submitted such a grant is distinctly a grant for Common School purposes, whether called special or general.\nIt will be observed that under s. 20 the distribution is to be made between the common and separate schools in each city, town, village or township.\nAt the time s. 20 was enacted the statutory provision governing the apportionment of the legislative grants was s. 106 (1) of the Common Schools Act of 1859, which reads as follows:\u2014\n106. It shall be the duty of the Chief Superintendent of Education\nand he is hereby empowered\u2014\n1. To apportion annually, on or before the first day of May, all moneys granted or provided by the Legislature for the support of Common Schools in Upper Canada, and not otherwise appropriated by law, to the several Counties, Townships, Cities, Towns and Incorporated Villages according to the ratio of population in each, as compared with the whole population of Upper Canada.\nThe sum, therefore, which the Chief Superintendent had for apportionment was not the whole of the moneys voted by the Legislature for the support of common schools, but only such portion thereof as remained after deducting the amounts \u201cotherwise appropriated by law.\u201d Having made the apportionment on the basis of population among the counties, townships, cities, towns and villages, it was then the duty of the Chief Superintendent to determine the proportion of the moneys allotted to each city, town and village or township, which the trustees of the separate schools situate therein respectively, were entitled to receive (s. 22 of the Act of 1863). As the sum total of the moneys apportioned did not include the portion of the grant \u201cappropriated by law\u201d, that is specifically appropriated by the Legislature, the separate schools were not entitled to share in such portion. That the separate schools cannot rightfully claim a share of the moneys appropriated by the Legislature to specific purposes seems to me to be clear and is, I think, practically admitted by the appellants in their factum. If, for example, the Legislature were to make a grant to assist in rebuilding a certain school house destroyed by fire, would the trustees of a separate school in the same township be entitled to a share thereof by virtue of s. 20? In my opinion they would not. If the trustees brought an action to enforce such a claim it would be a good answer thereto that the Legislature had voted the money for a specific purpose and that it could not be properly applied to any other purpose. In such a case a court could not properly direct that the moneys be applied in a manner other than that specifically directed by the Legislature. The same reasoning applies to a grant for apportionment among schools attaining a certain standard of efficiency or equipment, or made payable upon the performance of a condition. Unless the required standard be attained or the condition performed the grant would not be available for distribution.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that by \u201cPublic grants * * * for Common School purposes\u201d in s. 20, the Legislature meant general or unconditional grants in which all schools were to share. In other words, \u201cGrants * * * for Common School purposes\u201d meant \u201cGrants for the purposes of all Common Schools\u201d. These would include conditional grants for the same purpose once the condition had been performed. But as the authority of the Legislature to say whether or not any grant at all should be made, or to specify the conditions upon which public moneys shall be devoted to school purposes, is supreme, the only limitation imposed by s. 20 upon the exercise by the Legislature of its authority, so far as conditional grants are concerned, is that the separate schools must be given the same right as the common (now public) schools, to perform the conditions and earn the grant.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Thomas F.

L.R. 546\u2014Production at the trial of the judgment in the civil action.\nThe appellant having been found guilty of perjury committed in the trial of a civil action, one of the grounds of appeal to the appellate court was that there had been no evidence that the appellant was a witness in a judicial proceeding. The conviction having been affirmed, the appellant moved for leave to appeal to this court under s. 1024a Cr. Code, on the ground that the judgment sought to be appealed from conflicts with a judgment of an Ontario appellate court in a like case: Rex v. Drummond 10 Ont. L.R. 546. Held that the decision in the Drummond Case did not conflict with the judgment in this case: in the former case there was no record whatever produced, while in the present case the copy of the pleadings made use of as a record by the trial judge was put in evidence. The application for leave to appeal was dismissed.\nSemble that, although production, at the trial, of the judgment disposing of the civil action was not necessary, it would have been better practice that it should be put in in order to complete the record.\nMOTION for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, under section 1024a of the Criminal Code, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] upholding the conviction of the appellant for perjury in the trial of a civil action. The material facts of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nSmellie K.C. for the motion.\nRitchie K.C. contra.\nDecember 14, 1926.\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014Motion for leave to appeal under s. 1024 (a) of the Criminal Code on the ground that the judgment sought to be appealed from conflicts with a judgment of the Ontario Appellate Division in a like case. In the case at bar one of the grounds of appeal to the Appellate Division was that\nthere is no evidence that Gurditta was a witness in a judicial proceeding when he made the assertion which is charged as a perjury.\nThe alleged perjury was committed in the trial of the civil action of Brama v. Gurditta. At the trial of the perjury charge the clerk of assize proved from the entries in his court record that Gurditta had been sworn as a witness and had given evidence on the trial of the civil action. The court stenographer proved the evidence given by Gurditta at that trial. Counsel for the Crown put in evidence, as exhibit I, the record prepared for the use of the judge at the trial pursuant to rule 454, consisting of a certified copy of the endorsement upon the writ of summons and of the statement of defence, being the whole of the pleadings. The clerk of assize gave evidence that the case of Brama v. Gurditta, in which this record was used, was tried at the assize held before Mr. Justice Morrison on the 22nd of February, 1926, on which date the indictment charges the perjury was committed. The judgment disposing of the civil action does not appear to have been put in evidence.\nIn the judgment of the Appellate Division in the present proceeding Mr. Justice Martin, delivering the opinion of the court, held, on the authority of Regina v. Scott[2] , that it had been sufficiently established that Gurditta had given the evidence on which the perjury charge rests in a judicial proceeding, i.e., upon the trial before Mr. Justice Morrison of the civil action of Brama v. Gurditta of which the record was put in evidence.\nThis conclusion is said to conflict with the decision of the Ontario Appellate Division in Rex v. Drummond[3] , followed in Rex v. Legros[4] ; Rex v. Farrell [5]. As is pointed out, however, by Osler J.A., in the Drummond Case[6], at page 547, the only evidence there given was that of the clerk of assize for the county of Brant who swore that the defendant Drummond had been called as a witness on Kennedy's trial for murder and had been sworn by him as clerk of assize; and he produced his record book containing entries shewing that the defendant had given evidence at Kennedy's trial at which the alleged perjury was committed. The only other evidence was that of the court stenographer who related the evidence given by the accused at the Kennedy trial.\nNeither the indictment on which Drummond had been tried nor any copy, or sworn copy of it, was produced.\nThe court held that there was no proper evidence of a fact essential to the proof of the crime charged, viz., that there had been a judicial proceeding in which the alleged perjury was committed inasmuch as neither the indictment and formal record of such proceeding or a certificate under s. 691 of the Criminal Code had been produced.\nI am unable to find any conflict between the decision in the Drummond Case[7] and the case now before me. In the Drummond Case[8] there was no record whatever produced. Here the copy of the pleadings made use of as a record by the trial judge was put in evidence. This suffices to dispose of the application for leave under s. 1024 (a). I should perhaps add that, as at present advised, production at the trial of the judgment disposing of the action of Brama v. Gurditta was not necessary since the perjury was complete when the evidence was given at the trial and prosecution could have been instituted for it and conviction had although no judgment had ever been rendered in the civil action. Doubtless it would be better practice where judgment has been pronounced that it should be put in in order to complete the record.\nLeave to appeal will accordingly be refused.\nJanuary 18, 1927.\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The defendant renews his application for leave to appeal under s. 1024 (a) of the Criminal Code, relying upon other opinions which have been delivered by judges of the Appellate Division since his former motion for leave to appeal was refused. As the case now stands three of the five members of the Appellate Division (Martin, Galliher, and McPhillips JJ.A.) are of the opinion that it was sufficiently proven at the trial that the defendant was a witness in a judicial proceeding when he gave the evidence for the giving of which he has been convicted of perjury. In the view of three members of the Appellate Division (the Chief Justice, M. A. Macdonald and McPhillips JJ.A.), if the proof was technically incomplete because of the omission to adduce evidence of the writ of summons which began the civil action in which the alleged perjury was committed,\nno substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had actually occurred (s. 1014 (2) ).\nI find nothing in the added opinions now before me to bring this case within the purview of s. 1024 (a). The Drummond Case[9] is again invoked by the applicant as the judgment of another court of appeal which conflicts with the judgment appealed from. My reasons for not regarding the case of Rex v. Drummond[10] as \"a like case\" I have already stated.\nThe motion will be refused.\nMotion dismissed.\n[1] [1927] 1 W. W.

The barge and tug were going up the south channel formed by Russell Island, and were on the west, or their port, side of the channel. The Y., when approaching the channel, and before perceiving the tug or barge, altered her course somewhat to port. The tug gave one blast indicating her course, and the Y. then perceived that the tug was turning northeasterly to cross the channel and the Y.\u2019s bow. The signal conflicted with the Y\u2019s intended course and with the right of way which she had under R. 25 (Rules for the Great Lakes, adopted by Order in Council, 4th February, 1916). The Y. gave the danger signal. The tug returned the danger signal and, according to some witnesses, repeated the single blast, and the tug proceeded at full speed across the channel. The Y. then manoeuvred to get into starboard swing. It cleared the tug but struck the barge a glancing blow with its port bow on the port quarter. The court could not ascertain, on the evidence, whether the vessels were more or less than half a mile apart when the tug gave its first signal.\nHeld: Under all the circumstances, the neglect of the tug was the sole cause of the collision. Immediately before the tug and tow went to starboard they were either in a position of safety or where a starboard helm would have carried them clear of the Y\u2019s course which was then capable of perception. If the tug\u2019s signal were given before the Y. came within half a mile, the Y. was relieved of the requirement in R. 25 to signal her intended course; indeed she could not have done so without a breach of the rule forbidding a cross signal. On the other hand, if the Y. passed the half mile limit without signalling her course, the tug was confronted with a situation wherein the down-coming ship, which had the right of way, was on a course which would lead her to, or to the eastward of, midchannel, at the meeting place; and if, in the circumstances, the tug were in doubt about the Y\u2019s course her proper signal was danger under R. 22, and she was not justified in giving the starboard signal, which placed her and her tow, with their broad spread, across the channel and in front of the Y. It might be that the Y. was not required to signal, as it appeared that, by reason of the confusion of the lights on the tug and tow, she was not aware that they were in the channel until she received the tug\u2019s signal; but, assuming the Y. passed the half mile limit without notifying her course, and thus broke the rule, that neglect was not only antecedent to, but independent of, the negligence of the tug, which caused the accident. The case was within the class described by Lord Birkenhead\u2019s first category fin The Volute ([1922] 1 A.C. 129 at p. 136). It could not be said that the acts of the navigation of the two ships formed parts of one transaction, or that the second act of negligence, that of the tug and tow in crossing the channel in front of the Y., was consequential upon or involved with the first. Anglo-Newfoundland Development Co. v. Pacific Steam Nav. Co. ([1924] A.C. 406, at pp. 417, 420, 421, referred to.\nJudgment of Hodgins L.J.A. ([1926] Ex. C.R. 210) affirmed.\nA witness for the defendant had previously made a statement to an attorney of the plaintiff, which was reduced to writing and signed. The witness was cross-examined thereon, and subsequently the attorney was called to prove the statement and it was put in evidence in reply.\nHeld, referring to a passage in the trial judge\u2019s judgment, that if he held that the statement could be used against the defendant as evidence of the facts stated in it, he was clearly wrong; the statement was admissible only by way of contradiction and to affect the witness\u2019s credibility (Ewer v. Ambrose, 3 B. & C. 746; Wright v. Beckett, 1 M. & Rob. 414); but although the statement might have been used for a p urpose for which it was not admissible, it did not, on the whole case, result in any substantial miscarriage of justice or affect the decision.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Toronto Admiralty District (Hodgins L.J.A.)[1] in favour of the plaintiff for damages, and dismissing the defendant\u2019s counter-claim for damages, in respect to a collision between a ship, owned by the plaintiff, and a barge, owned by the defendant, in tow of a tug owned by the defendant. The facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now (reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nO. S. Tyndale K.C. for the appellant.\nF. King K.C. and H. Dale Harris for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The action was brought by the plaintiff company (respondent), owner of the steamship Yorkton, to recover, against the defendant (appellant), damages caused by collision of the steamship with the barge Badger, which was at the time in tow of the tug Thomas E. Tees, both tug and tow belonging to the defendant company. The defendant denied liability, and pleaded a counterclaim. The action was tried before the local judge in Admiralty at Toronto, who found for the plaintiff, and dismissed the counter-claim. It is from this judgment that the defendant appeals to this court.\nThe facts may be taken as gathered from the findings of the learned local judge, because, although the evidence is contradictory, and the result unsatisfactory to the appellant, the findings are reasonably supported by the proof, and, giving them their due weight, cannot in my opinion be disturbed. None of the specific faults alleged against the Yorkton by the defendant\u2019s preliminary act or pleadings is established, and the defendant, having regard to the facts found, must bear the loss occasioned by the collision, unless it can shift liability to the plaintiff by reason of the neglect of the Yorkton to signal her course, as required by Rule 25, which I shall quote.\nI proceed then to state the material facts which are not in dispute or are found. The collision occurred in the St. Clair river, where the rules governing the navigation are those for the Great Lakes, adopted by Order in Council of 4th February, 1916. On the night of 24th June, 1925, the Yorkton, which is a steel steamship of 1,136 tons register, length 250 feet, beam 42 feet 8 inches, and drawing at the time 13 feet, was descending the St. Clair river from Port Arthur, with a cargo of oats. Opposite the Chenal Ecart\u00e9, about a mile and a half above the head of Russell Island, which divides the river into two channels, north and south, the Yorkton\u2019s engines were checked to half speed, about six knots, and her course was laid on the flashing gas buoy at the upper end of the shoal, which projects, up stream from the head of the island, a distance of half a mile or thereabouts; and here it may be useful to observe that this shoal was being dredged, and that, by reason of the dredging which had been done, the gas buoy had been moved, and was, at the time of these occurrences, stationed 200 feet to the westward of the position which it occupies on the chart used at the trial. When the Yorkton, in her course toward the gas buoy, had reached a point about half a mile above it, her course was altered somewhat to port and steadied in a direction down the south channel, between the gas buoy and the lower light of Walpole Island on the opposite side of the channel, these lights bearing about a half point on the starboard and port bows respectively. Up to this time, those in charge of the navigation of the Yorkton had not perceived the tug or her tow, with which she subsequently came into contact. These two craft were coming up the south channel, the tug towing the barge astern by a hawser or tow line 150 feet in length. The Badger was a sand and gravel scow, having an open hold, with no deck for the greater part of her length. The tug was 86 feet long, beam 16 feet, draft 6 to 9 feet; the Badger 140 feet long, beam 36 feet, draft, at the time when she was light, 1\u00bd feet. They were between the head of Russell Island and the gas buoy at the top of the shoal, on the west, or their port, side of the channel. The time was about 11.30, daylight saving, and the night was dark with showers. The tug and tow carried lights in excess of those . prescribed by the rules, and, although some of these lights had been perceived by the Yorkton previously to her change of course, they were not made out to be running lights, but were mistaken for the lights of a dredge, which had been working o-n the shoal when the Yorkton passed up a few days previously. They had been attentively examined by the master of the Yorkton thorough his marine glasses as he came down, but they did not change bearing, they ranged with the flashing light, close to the shoal, and appeared to him, and to his second mate, who was also in the wheel house, as a cluster of fixed lights, such as the dredge would be likely to show; no running lights could be discerned. It was after the Yorkton changed her course to bear midway between the gas buoy and the lower Walpole light that the lights of the tug became distinctive, and, at the same time, the tug gave one blast indicating its course; it was then perceived that the tug was turning northeasterly to cross the channel and the bow of the Yorkton. The signal conflicted with the intended course of the Yorkton, and with the right of way which she had under Rule 25, which provides that:\nWhen steamers are approaching each other \u201chead and head,\u201d or nearly so, it shall be the duty of each steamer to pass on the port side of the other; and the pilot of either steamer may be first in determining to pursue this course, and thereupon shall give, as a signal of his intention, one short and distinct blast of his whistle, which the pilot of the other steamer shall answer promptly by a similar blast of his whistle, and thereupon such steamers shall pass on the port side of each other. But if the courses of such steamers are so far on the starboard of each other as not to be considered by pilots as meeting \u201chead and head,\u201d or nearly so, the pilot so first deciding shall immediately give two short and distinct blasts of his whistle, which the pilot of the other steamer shall answer promptly by two similar blasts of his whistle, and they shall pass on the starboard side of each other: Provided, however, that in all narrow channels, where there is current, and in the rivers Saint Mary, Saint Clair, Detroit, Niagara, and Saint Lawrence, when two steamers are meeting, the descending steamer shall have the right of way, and shall, before the vessels shall have arrived within the distance of one-half mile of each other, give the signal necessary to indicate which side she elects to take.\nIn the night, steamers will be considered as meeting \u201c head and head \u201c so long as both the coloured lights of each are in view of the other.\nThe master of the Yorkton tells us that he was on the point of sounding two blasts the moment he discovered the lights of the tug, but was anticipated by its signal. This placed him in a difficult position. He was forbidden by Rule 23 to give a cross signal, and therefore could not persist in his intention to negotiate the passage on his port side, and he was entering a narrow channel with considerable current setting him on. In the circumstances he took what I have no doubt was a prudent, if not the only proper, course. He gave the danger signal, \u201cfive or more short and rapid blasts of the whistle,\u201d which, in the circumstances was, I should think, intended by the Yorkton, and ought to have been interpreted by the tug, to mean\u2014\u201dyou (the tug) are creating a dangerous situation. Reconsider.\u201d The answer from the tug was a return of the danger signal, and, according to some of the witnesses, a repetition of the single blast, and the tug proceeded at full speed across the channel. The master of the Yorkton then promptly executed the necessary manoeuvres to bring his ship into starboard swing. He cleared the tug, but struck the barge a glancing blow with his port bow on the port quarter, causing a breach from which the barge filled and sank, but not until it had reached the shoal to which the tug turned when the Yorkton passed.\nIt is impossible to ascertain precisely what the distance was between the Yorkton and the tug at the time when the latter gave its first signal. The master of the tug said in his direct examination that, as nearly as he could judge, the Yorkton would be within about half a mile. The learned trial judge refers to the evidence upon this point. He says:\nAs to when she saw the Yorkton change her course, her master says: \u201cWhen I got within about \u00bd mile as near as I could judge the Yorkton swung sharply to port * * * within about \u00bd a mile of the Yorkton, that is in a direct line, she swung to port.\u201d On cross-examination he says: \u201cI would figure that we were about a mile apart when she altered her course to port; or about \u00bd mile; pardon * * * we would be about 1,300 feet-1,200 feet, I couldn\u2019t say just exactly.\u201d I have come to the conclusion that these last figures are incorrect and that his distance from the Yorkton was further than the quotation indicates.\nDifferent witnesses give different estimates. There is no precise finding. It is possible that the vessels were still upwards of half a mile apart. It is not improbable that they were less than half a mile. The master of the York-ton said in cross-examination \u201cmaybe a little bit better than a quarter of a mile.\u201d The conditions made it difficult to form an accurate opinion as to the distance. It is noteworthy, however, that the Yorkton is not charged, either in the defendant\u2019s preliminary act or pleadings, with any fault for not having notified her course. It would look as if the master of the tug did not realize the application of Rule 25. In any case I think it must be taken that immediately before the tug and tow went to starboard they were either in a position of safety, or where a starboard helm would have carried them clear of the Yorkton\u2019s course, which, in view of her position and line of progress, as disclosed by her lights and the shore lights on either side, was not then incapable of perception. If the tug\u2019s signal were given before the Yorkton came within half a mile of the tug the Yorkton would clearly be relieved of the requirement to signal her intended course; indeed she could not have done so without a breach of the rule forbidding a cross signal. On the other hand, if the Yorkton passed the half mile limit without signalling her course, the tug was then confronted with a situation wherein the down-coming ship, which had the right of way, was on a course which would lead her to mid-channel, or to the eastward of midchannel, at the meeting place; and if, having regard to the circumstances, the tug were in any doubt about the Yorkton\u2019s course, its proper signal was danger under Rule 22, and there was no justification which I can perceive for the starboard signal which the tug did give, and which placed her and her tow, with their broad spread, across the channel, and in front of the Yorkton. It may be that the Yorkton was not required to signal, because the findings uphold the claim of her witnesses that, by reason of the confusion of the lights on the tug and tow, they were not aware that the tug and tow were in the channel until the Yorkton received the signal from the tug; but, assuming that the Yorkton passed the half mile limit without notifying her course, and thus broke the rule, that neglect was not only antecedent to, but in my view independent of, the negligence of the tug, which caused the accident. The case is within the class described by Lord Birkenhead\u2019s first category in the House of Lords in The Volute[2]:\nIn all cases of damage by collision on land or sea, there are three ways in which the question of contributory negligence may arise. A. is suing for damage thereby received. He was negligent, but his negligence had brought about a state of things in which there would have been no damage if B. had not been subsequently and severably negligent. A recovers in full: see among other cases Spaight v. Tedcastle[3] and The Margaret[4].\nAn inquiry by the tug, which could have been conveyed by a danger signal, would presumably have elicited the information that the Yorkton was taking her port side of the channel, a course which perhaps might have been inferred from the situation in the absence of a signal. The Yorkton was coming down with the current, and had to contend with the difficulties of navigation incident to a ship in that position. The channel is said, and appears by the chart to be, about or nearly 800 feet in width. The tug and tow were on the western side where the slack water was, and, if close to the bank, were safe, or, if not, they could have gone closer, and thus have avoided any danger of collision. But the master of the tug, whether because he thought he was on the wrong side of the channel or for some other reason, at the critical moment, chose to port his helm and project across the narrow channel, the unhandy triad with the navigation of which he was charged, measuring in length, tug, hawser and tow, no less than 376 feet, and occupying a very considerable expanse as compared with that which would have been taken up on a course parallel to the bank. It cannot well be said that the acts of the navigation on the two ships formed parts of one transaction, or that the second act of negligence, that of the tug and tow in crossing the channel in front of the Yorkton, was consequential upon or involved with the first. One can only conjecture what would have happened if the Yorkton had signalled her course before hearing the blast from the tug. It is true that the difference in time between the Yorkton passing within the half mile limit and the signal and porting of the tug was not great, but it was long enough to have enabled the master of the tug to reach an obvious conclusion, and to refrain from a course the danger of which was patent. He should have remembered Rules 37 and 38. There is in my view sufficient distinction as to time, place and circumstance to justify the treating of the negligence of the tug as the sole cause of the collision. Anglo-Newfoundland Development Co. v. Pacific Steam Navigation Co.[5].\nThere is one other point that I should mention, because, having accepted the findings of the local judge, I have not thought it necessary to review the evidence in detail. The defendant's leading witness, Oapt. Duff, of the ss. Superior, was coming up the north channel, between the head of the island and the upper end of the shoal, at the time when the vessels concerned were approaching each other and came into collision opposite to him in the south channel. He was put forward as an independent witness and he gave some testimony favourable to the defence in his direct, examination, the effect of which was however considerably shattered when he came to be cross-examined. During his cross-examination it transpired that he had previously been interrogated by an attorney from Cleveland, acting under the plaintiff's instructions, and had made a statement which the attorney reduced to writing, and which Capt. Duff signed. He was cross-examined upon this statement, and subsequently the attorney was called to prove the statement, and it was put in evidence in reply. It served its purpose of course to discredit or to affect the credibility of Capt. Duff, but the learned trial judge made this comment:\nDuff, master of the Superior, called for the defendants, says that when he saw the tug and tow, they were pretty close to Russell Island, as though they intended to cross between the buoy and the island. Though this witness very clearly showed his unreliability, the defendants cannot complain if his early statement to Mr. Theodore Robinson (the attorney), Ex. 3, is used against them, especially as he adduces a reason for his belief which discloses an interest in their position in relation to his ship.\nIf by this the learned judge mean that the statement which Capt. Duff gave to Mr. Robinson can be used against the defendant, as evidence of the facts stated in it, he is clearly wrong. The statement was admissible only by way of contradiction and to affect the witness's credibility. Ewer v. Ambrose[6]; Wright v. Beckett[7]. I see no reason to believe, however, that the learned judge would or could have arrived at a different conclusion in the case if the statement had not been introduced, and, although it may have been used for a purpose for which it was not admissible, I do not think it has resulted in any substantial miscarriage of justice, or affected the decision.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Rodd, Wigle & Whiteside.\nSolicitors for the respondent: King & Smythe.\n[1] [1926] Ex.

Co. had leased lands to C.S. Co., and, on June 4, 1925, served on it notice of forfeiture for non-payment of rent. C.S. Co. being in financial difficulties, a committee of its creditors was formed to look after its affairs, and this committee negotiated with C.T. Co. for the latter to take a sub-lease, and it was alleged that a sub-lease was agreed upon for three months at a net rental of $2,400. C.S. Co. signed a lease, which C.T. Co. refused to accept. C.T. Co. went into possession on July 9, 1925. On September 28, 1925, C.S. Co. was adjudged bankrupt. On October 1, 1925, C.T. Co. took possession under a lease from D. Co. of that date. An action was brought in the name of the trustee in bankruptcy of C.S. Co. against D. Co. and C.T. Co. for possession. The lease from D. Co. to C.S. Co. contained a proviso for re-entry by the lessor on non-payment of rent, but the question arose whether D. Co.'s. notice of forfeiture was sufficient to terminate the lease and allow it to re-enter without a demand for rent according to the formalities of the common law (which demand was not made), this question depending on whether the lease should be construed as being subject to the Short Forms of Leases Act, R.S. B.C., 1924, c. 234. Held, without deciding the question last mentioned, the defendants were entitled to have the lease from D. Co. to C.S. Co. treated as void, under a covenant in the lease that the lease would cease and become void, at the option of the lessor, if the lessee became insolvent or made an assignment for the benefit of creditors, D. Co. having, at the end of the trial, exercised its option to avoid the lease on this ground. The taking of possession by C.T. Co. on October 1 as tenant of D. Co. was a sufficient re-entry by D. Co. in so far as requisite.\nHeld, further, that plaintiff could not recover from C.T. Co. the $2,400 above mentioned, either as for rent or by way of compensation for use and occupation, for the following reasons: that C.S. Co. did not profess to be in possession of the foreshore (part of the lands in question) when, at its instance, C.T. Co. entered on July 9; on the contrary, C.S. Co. was then denying the title of its landlord, D. Co., and endeavouring to obtain a lease of the foreshore from the Crown; there was no demise, and possession was never effectively given to C.T. Co. by C.S. Co.; furthermore, C.T. Co. was obliged to pay to D. Co. for its occupation compensation amounting to the said sum of $2,400.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (38 B.C. Rep. 401) reversed in part.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] in so far as it held (sustaining in this respect the judgment of D. A. McDonald J.) that a certain lease from the defendant J. A. Dewar Company Limited to the Coast Shingle Company Limited was no longer a valid and subsisting lease, but had been effectually terminated through forfeiture and re-entry; and cross-appeal by the defendant Capilano Timber Company Limited from the said judgment in so far as it held (reversing in this respect the judgment of D. A. McDonald J.) that the plaintiff should recover from it the sum of $2,400 for rent. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs, and the cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nAlfred Bull for the appellant.\nA. Geoffrion K.C. and E. F. Newcombe for the respondents. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014This is an action which one Frank King, who had large interests in the Coast Shingle Company, Limited, was authorized to bring in the name of the trustee in bankruptcy of that company under s. 35 of The Bankruptcy Act. The facts which gave rise to the litigation are as follows:\nAt all material times referred to hereinafter, the J. A. Dewar Co., Limited, was lessee under a lease granted by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, called the head lease, of certain lands and of a portion of the foreshore on the north side of False Creek in the city of Vancouver, on which a shingle mill and other buildings had been erected by different parties holding under sub-leases granted by the Dewar Company. These parties having failed and their leases having become forfeited, the Dewar Company, on the 21st of June, 1922, leased the premises to the False Creek Shingle Company, Limited.\nOn the 6th of December, 1923, the False Creek Shingle Company having become insolvent and its lease having been forfeited for non-payment of rent, the Dewar Company leased the lands, and the foreshore so far as it had the right to do so, to the Coast Shingle Company, Limited, which I will call the Coast Company.\nIn view of the controversy that has arisen, the material provisions of this lease\u2014which was virtually a copy of the lease to the False Creek Shingle Company\u2014should be briefly noted.\nThis sub-lease covered the full term of the lessor's lease from the Canadian Pacific, and of an extension thereto subsequently made. It recited the lease to the False Creek Shingle Company and the termination of the latter's tenancy for non-payment of rent. It also stated that the lessor had applied to the Department of Lands of British Columbia for leasehold or other title to the foreshore and lands covered by water. The rent was to be $200 per month, payable in advance, and in consideration of this rent the lessor gave the lessee the use and possession of the lands and foreshore in so far as it could do so. The lessor also transferred to the lessee any interest which it had or might have in the buildings, machinery, plant, tools, equip- ment and fixtures. It was covenanted that the lessor would use its best endeavours to obtain title to the foreshore or lands covered by water and would lease them to the lessee. The lease contained several covenants, among others the following:\u2014\nProviso for re-entry by the Lessor on non-payment of rent or non-performance of covenants and this proviso shall extend to and apply to all covenants whether positive or negative.\nIt was expressly stated that there was no covenant by the lessor for quiet enjoyment, and it was also agreed that in case the lessee should become insolvent, or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, the lease would, at the option of the lessor, cease and be void and the term would expire.\nThe Coast Company entered into possession under this lease but soon fell behind in the payment of the rental, several months of which were in arrears when, on June 4, 1925, the Dewar Company caused to be served on the Coast Company a notice of forfeiture of the interest and right of possession of the latter company for non-payment of rent.\nAbout the same time the Coast Company found itself in financial difficulties and called a meeting of its creditors who formed a committee for the purpose of looking after the involved affairs of the company. This committee, of course, had no legal status, but it was expected that the Coast Company would give effect to any measures the committee decided upon. The president of the committee was Mr. Albert Twining. Before the notice of forfeiture of the lease, the Coast Company had ceased to operate the shingle mill, and Mr. Twining and his committee, who were aware of the notice of forfeiture, sought to have the company's lease reinstated by the Dewar Company so that it might grant a sub-lease of the premises.\nThe chief obstacle to this reinstatement, besides the large amount of rent in arrears, was that the Coast Company, in breach, it is alleged, of its legal obligations under the lease, had itself applied to the provincial government for a lease of the foreshore, without which the property would have but little value. It had been at first assumed that the Canadian Pacific Rly. Co. had acquired valid title to the foreshore from the Dominion Government, but at the time to which I refer it appears to have been common ground that the title was in the province, and the Dewar Company, as stated in its lease, had applied to the Provincial Government for a lease of this foreshore. In the negotiations entered into with the view of having the lease reinstated, Mr. Dewar on behalf of his company insisted on the withdrawal of the Coast Company's application for the foreshore. This condition was never fulfilled, Mr. King and his associates apparently thinking that their application had a better chance of being granted than that of the Dewar Company.\nIn the meantime, the creditors' committee endeavoured to sub-lease the property. For that purpose, Mr. Twining entered into negotiations with Mr. Johnson, the general manager of the Capilano Timber Company, which I will call the Capilano Company. It is alleged that the latter agreed to take the property for three months at a rental of $1,000 per month, subject to certain deductions so that the net rental for the three months amounted to $2,400. The Committee of the creditors had, of course, no authority to make such a lease, but apparently it was assumed that the Coast Company would ratify what had been done, and its solicitor prepared a lease signed by it for the three months, which, however, the solicitor of the Capilano Company refused to accept. The latter company entered into possession on the 9th of July, 1925.\nShort of taking legal proceedings, Mr. Dewar tried to force the Capilano Company to leave the premises. At his request, the water supply for the mill was shut off and a threat was made, but not carried out, of blocking the road that gave access to the property. Finally the parties got together. It was agreed between their solicitors that the Dewar Company would lease the property to the Capilano Company at the same rental as that charged to the Coast Company, $200 per month, that a demand of assignment for the benefit of creditors would be made to the latter company, that the Capilano Company would pay a premium for the lease of $2,400, which was equal to the arrears of rent due by the Coast Company, that the lease and the premium paid would be placed in escrow until the Coast Company had been put in bankruptcy. All this was carried out, and on October 1, 1925, the Capilano Company took possession under a lease from the Dewar Company of that date, a receiving order against the Coast Company which was adjudged bankrupt having been made on the 28th of September. The appellant, Geo. Winter, an authorized trustee in bankruptcy, was named receiver of the estate of the Coast Company.\nAs I explained in the beginning, this action is taken in the name of the trustee but for the benefit of Frank King. The Dewar Company and the Capilano Company are defendants. The plaintiff asked for a declaration that the Coast Company's lease is a valid and subsisting lease, that the notice of forfeiture of the 4th of June, 1925, is void and of no effect, that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the premises, that the Capilano Company be ordered to give up possession to the plaintiff and to pay to the latter rent at the rate of $1,000 per month until such possession is given him, or, in the alternative, that the Capilano Company pay damages for wrongfully withholding possession from the plaintiff for the three months' period provided by the Landlord and Tenant Act.\nThe learned trial judge rejected the plaintiff's demand in toto. The Court of Appeal granted the plaintiff $2,400 for rental during three months under the arrangement made by the creditors' committee with the Capilano Company, but otherwise dismissed his action. The plaintiff appeals and seeks to obtain a declaration that the Coast Company's lease is valid and subsisting, and has not been legally forfeited, and that its trustee is entitled to possession under that lease. The Capilano Company cross-appeals and prays for relief from the judgment against it in favour of the plaintiff for $2,400 as balance due on rent under the three months' lease.\nMany interesting questions are raised by the appeal, the most important being the question whether the Coast Company's lease from the Dewar Company is subject to the Short Form of Leases Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, ch. 234. On this latter question the learned judges of the Court of Appeal were equally divided.\nThe point, in short, is whether there is in the lease in question a sufficient reference to the Act. If so, the proviso for re-entry, which I have quoted, would be construed according to the second schedule of the Act, and the notice of forfeiture of June 4, 1925, would be sufficient to terminate the lease and allow the lessor to re-enter without a demand of rent according to the formalities of the common law, which demand was not made.\nNotwithstanding the interest and importance which attaches to this question, and although Mr. Dewar persisted in saying that he claimed forfeiture only for non-payment of rent, I think the respondents are entitled to have the Coast Company's lease treated as void under the covenant that the lease would cease and become void, at the option of the lessor, if the lessee became insolvent or made an assignment for the benefit of creditors. The Dewar Company, at the end of the trial, exercised its option to avoid the lease on this ground. The taking of possession by the Capilano Company on October 1 as tenant of the Dewar Company is a sufficient re-entry by the latter in so far as requisite. Under these circumstances, it seems unnecessary to express any opinion on the question concerning the Short Form of Leases Act, and the main appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAs to the cross-appeal, the Coast Company did not profess to be in possession of the foreshore when, at its instance, the Capilano Company entered on the 9th of July, 1925. On the contrary, the Coast Company was then denying the title of its landlord, the Dewar Company, and endeavouring to obtain a lease of the foreshore from the Crown. There was no demise, and possession of the premises was never effectively given to the Capilano Company by the Coast Company. Furthermore, the Capilano Company was obliged to pay to the Dewar Company for its occupation compensation amounting to the sum claimed by the Coast Company. In these circumstances, we think, with great respect, that the claim of the Coast Company, whether as for rent or by way of compensation for use and occupation, cannot be maintained and that the cross-appeal must, consequently, succeed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs; cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tupper, Bull & Tupper.\nSolicitor for the respondent Capilano Timber Company Limited: J. H. Lawson.\nSolicitor for the respondent J. A. Dewar Company Limited: W.J.Baird.\n[1] 38 B.C. Rep. 401; [1927] 1 W.W.R. 811.\n",

Devine and Others (Defendants) Respondents.\n1927: October 11, 12; 1927: December 16.\nPresent: Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nLease\u2014Action for rent\u2014Counterclaim\u2014Misrepresentation\u2014Damages\u2014Several claims based upon distinct alleged causes of action\u2014Jury\u2014General verdict\u2014New trial.\nThe appellant company, a canning concern, leased a sawmill and equipment to the respondents and brought action under the lease to recover rent. The respondents, by the lease, covenanted to \"take up\" the appellant's logging contracts, and in particular one with the Clayton Logging Company. The respondents' counterclaim was based upon three distinct alleged causes of action: first, a claim based upon the allegation that the appellant had induced the respondents to enter into the agreement by falsely and fraudulently representing the contract with the Clayton Logging Company to be a subsisting contract at the date of the lease; second, a claim for damages for breach of a contract to take and pay for box shooks which the respondents by the terms of the lease agreed to manufacture from the box lumber in the yard of the mill at the time of the lease; and third, a claim for damages arising from a series of malicious acts on the part of the appellant. A general verdict was given by the jury for the respondents for $19,460. The respondents admit in their factum that they failed to establish either the second or the third of these causes of action.\nHeld that, under the circumstances of this case, there must be a new trial. The charge of the trial judge was calculated to lead the jury to think that they might properly hold the appellant company responsible as for breach of the agreement to take and pay for the box shooks and, moreover, from some of the judge's observations, they may have received the impression that the respondents were entitled to reparation in respect of the alleged malicious acts. The jury did not disclose by their verdict how much (if any) of the damages awarded should be attributed to these alleged causes of action now admitted to be without substance; and prima facie, therefore, the observations in the charge cannot be overlooked as innocuous, and they may have led the jury into substantial error. As the verdict was a general one, and as the trial judge gave the jury no guidance concerning the method by which damages should be measured, it is impossible to determine how far they may have deviated from the appropriate rule.\nHeld, also, assuming the charge of fraud established as to the misrepresentations by the appellant company touching the Clayton Co.'s contract, the respondents would be entitled to recover compensation for the loss arising naturally and directly from their assumption of the obligations of the lease and the contracts; but they were not entitled to be compensated for loss of profits which they might or would have made if the representations had been true, and which they did not realize because the facts stated to them were non-existent. The question for the jury was not \" How much would the respondents have gained in profits if the representations had been true,\" but, \"What loss expressed in pecuniary terms, did the respondents suffer, that is directly ascribable to the transactions into which they were induced to enter?\" McConnell v. Wright [1903] 1 Ch. 546; Johnston v. Braham [1917] 1 K.B. 586.\nHeld, further, that the respondents, if their allegations are well founded, were, on learning the true facts, entitled to repudiate the lease and the contracts, but they were not bound to do so; and, having elected against repudiation, they were entitled to maintain an action for deceit, if the elements of such a cause of action were disclosed by the facts in evidence.\nHeld, further, that the damages recoverable would include not only sums paid in execution of the obligations entered into, but also all loss reasonably incurred in carrying out those obligations or in measures reasonably taken for that purpose, allowance being made, of course, for moneys received and the pecuniary value of advantages gained.\nHeld, further, that the present case is one in which effect must be given to the British Columbia Statute, R.S.B.C., c. 58, s. 55.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of Macdonald J. and maintaining the respondents' counterclaim for $19,460, upon a verdict by a jury.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nC. W. Craig K.C. and R. L. Reid K.C. for the appellant.\nA. Geoffrion K.C. and J. A. Prud'homme K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014We have come to the conclusion that there must be a new trial; and consequently all unnecessary discussion of the facts will be avoided.\nBy an instrument of the 15th of March, 1925, the respondents, the Devines, leased a sawmill at Namu from the appellant company (a canning concern), and by agreements of the same date the Devines and the company mutually agreed, first, that the Devines were to manufacture all the box lumber in the yard of the mill into box shooks and to provide any additional lumber which might be necessary for that purpose, for which the appellant company was to pay at certain nominated rates; and, second that the Devines were to supply power for lighting and pumping, and steam for the cannery.\nBy the lease, the Devines covenanted to \"take up\" the appellant company's logging contracts, and in particular two specified contracts, of which one was with the Clayton Logging Company.\nThree claims, based upon distinct alleged causes of action, were set forth in the statement of the counterclaim by the respondents: first, a claim based upon the allegation that the appellant company had induced the respondents to enter into the transactions mentioned, by falsely and fraudulently representing the contract with the Clayton Logging Company to be a subsisting contract at the date of the lease; second, a claim for damages for breach of the contract to take and pay for box shooks; third, a claim for damages arising from a series of malicious acts on the part of the appellant company, aimed, it is alleged, at compassing the ruin of the respondents.\nThe respondents in their factum admit that they failed to establish either the second or the third of these causes of action, and, as respects them, the counter-action should be dismissed; but we agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that there was some evidence to go to the jury in support of the allegations of fraud, and, that accordingly the finding upon the issue raised by them cannot properly be set aside as perverse.\nWe are, however, constrained to the view that there was a mistrial. The charge was calculated to lead the jury to think that they might properly hold the appellant company responsible as for breach of the agreement to take and pay for box shooks under the contract of the 3rd of March; and, moreover, from some of the learned judge's observations, they may have received the impression that the respondents were entitled to reparation in respect of the alleged malicious acts, referred to above as constituting the respondents' third cause of action. The jury did not disclose by their verdict how much (if any) of the damages awarded should be attributed to these alleged causes of action now admitted to be without substance; and prima facie, therefore, the observations in the charge cannot be overlooked as innocuous. In truth, they may have led the jury into substantial error. Upon both causes of action their respondents founded a claim for compensation for loss of profits in support of which evidence was copiously received\u2014a claim which could not be supported upon the grounds stated in the pleadings, as the respondents now admit; nor, for reasons to be outlined, could such a claim be sustained for damages arising out of the fraud, according to the respondents' present contention. Yet, as the verdict was a general one, and as the learned trial judge gave the jury no guidance concerning the method by which damages should be measured, it is impossible to determine how far they may have deviated from the appropriate rule.\nAs already mentioned, the respondents alleged, by their statement of claim, that they had been induced to enter into the lease and the contemporary contracts, by the appellant company's fraudulent misrepresentations touching the Clayton Company's contract. Assuming the charge of fraud established, the respondents would be entitled to recover compensation for the loss arising naturally and directly from their assumption of the obligations of the lease and the contracts; but they were not entitled to be compensated for loss of profits which they might or would have made if the representations had been true, and which they did not realize because the facts stated to them were non-existent. The question for the jury was not, \" How much would the respondents have gained in profits if the representations had been true,\" but, \" What loss expressed in pecuniary terms, did the respondents suffer, that is directly ascribable to the transactions into which they were induced to enter?\" McConnell v. Wright[2]; Johnston v. Braham[3].\nThe respondents, if their allegations are well founded, were, on learning the true facts, entitled to repudiate the lease and the contracts; but they were not bound to do so, and having elected against repudiation, they were entitled to maintain an action for deceit, if the elements of such a cause of action were disclosed by the facts in evidence. Arnison v. Smith[4]; Peek v. Derry[5]; McConnell v. Wright[6]; Goold v. Gillies[7].\nThe damages recoverable would include not only sums paid in execution of the obligations entered into, but also all loss reasonably incurred in carrying out those obligations or in measures reasonably taken for that purpose, allowance being made, of course, for moneys received and the pecuniary value of advantages gained.\nIt must be distinctly understood that nothing which has been said implies any opinion as to the effect or the weight of the evidence adduced either to support or to repel the charges of fraud, or upon any other question of fact within the province of the jury.\nWe have come to the conclusion that this is a case in which effect must be given to the British Columbia statute, R.S.B.C., c. 58, s. 55.\nNothing herein, or in any Act, or in any rules of court, shall take away or prejudice the right of any party to any action to have the issues for trial by jury submitted and left by the judge to the jury before whom the same shall come for trial, with a proper and complete direction to the jury upon the law and as to the evidence applicable to such issues: Provided also that the said right may be enforced by appeal, as provided by the Court of Appeal Act, this Act, or rules of court, without any exception having been taken at the trial: Provided further that in the event of a new trial being granted upon ground of objection not taken at the trial, the costs of the appeal shall be paid by the appellant, and the costs of the abortive trial shall be in the discretion of the court.\nHaving regard to the conduct of the trial and to the character of the learned judge's charge, we do not think the course taken by counsel for the defence was such as to disentitle the appellant company from taking advantage of this enactment, although, in the special circumstances, there should be an exceptional order as to costs.\nTherefore, as to the first of the above mentioned causes of action there will be a new trial, and as to the second and third causes of action the action will be dismissed. The respondents are entitled to the costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal, which are to be set off against the appellant company's costs of the appeal to this court, the residue, if any, of such last mentioned costs to be the appellant company's costs in the cause in any event.\nThe costs of the abortive trial and of the action, in so far as they are to be attributed to the alleged causes of action upon which the respondents fail, will be the appellant company's costs in the cause in any event; subject to that, the general costs of the abortive trial will abide the event of the new trial.\nNew trial.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Reid, Wallbridge & Gibson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H.

Rosalie \u201cgateways\u201d\u2014\u201dEastern lines\u201d\u2014\u201cSelect territory\u201d\u2014\u201cPreferred movements\u201d\u2014Leave to appeal granted by Board\u2014Question of jurisdiction within the Railway Act.\nThe lines of the Canadian National Railways run from Sydney, Halifax and other places in Nova Scotia through Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and eastern Quebec by way of Moncton, Levis, Diamond Junction and Ste. Rosalie to stations in central and western Canada; the Canadian National Railway Co. also owns and operates a line of railway between Moncton and Saint John. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. owns and operates a railway line which extends from Saint John to Montreal, with a branch running to Ste. Rosalie. Both of these railway systems directly or indirectly connect the Maritime Provinces with all the commercially important sections of Canada west of these provinces. For some years prior to 1925, shipments originating on the lines of the Canadian National Railways, in the Maritime provinces, could be routed, first, over the Canadian National Railways as far as Saint John or Ste. Rosalie, and thence over the Canadian Pacific Railway to their destination; and, as regards goods shipped to destinations reached by both railways, there existed parity of rates for three classes of routes; first, over the Canadian National Railways direct; second, over the Canadian National Railways to Saint John and thence by the Canadian Pacific Railway and third over the Canadian National Railways to Ste. Rosalie and thence over the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1925, the Canadian National Railway Co. published supplementary tariffs which purported, as to classes of traffic affected by them, \u201cto eliminate the alternative routings by way of Saint John and Ste. Rosalie,\u201d and the Board of Railway Commissioners, October 19, 1926, disallowed the \u201cprovisions\u201d of these supplements \u201cin so far as they proposed to eliminate routings via Saint John and Ste. Rosalie,\u201d thus restoring \u201cthe parity of rates\u201d mentioned above. Such was the situation when the Maritime Freight Rates Act of 1927 was passed. Section 2 of the Act gives the meaning of the phrase \u201ceastern lines,\u201d as \u201cthe lines of railway now operated as a part of the Canadian National Railways and situated within the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, and the lines of railway, similarly operated, in the provinces of Quebec extending from the southern provincial boundary near Matapedia and near Courchesne to Diamond Junction and Levis.\u201d Section 8 defines the phrase \u201cselect territory,\u201d as including Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island in addition to the localities on \u201cthe lines in the province of Quebec mentioned in section 2.\u201d Section 3, requires the cancellation of tolls in force at its date (normal tolls), in respect of the \u201cmovements of freight traffic\u201d described as \u201cpreferred movements,\u201d and the substitution therefor of tariffs of reduced tolls (statutory tolls). The \u201cpreferred movements\u201d comprise three classes, first, of local traffic between points on the \u201cEastern lines,\u201d second, of export traffic destined overseas between points on the \u201cEastern lines\u201d and ocean ports on the \u201cEastern lines,\u201d and third, of westbound traffic originating on the \u201cEastern lines,\u201d and extending westward beyond those lines. As respects the first and second of these classes of \u201cpreferred movements,\u201d the statutory tolls are ascertained by making a deduction from the normal tolls of approximately twenty per cent. As respects the third class of such movements, the statutory rate is ascertained by making a deduction, also of twenty per cent, but, in this case, the deduction takes effect only upon that part of the \u201cthrough rate,\u201d which the statute in section 4 describes as the \u201cEastern lines proportion of\u201d that rate. Section 9 provides for the non-compulsory reduction of rates by companies, other than those concerned with the \u201cEastern lines,\u201d which own or operate railways \u201cin or extending into the select territory.\u201d Such companies are permitted, in order to \u201cmeet\u201d the compulsory statutory rates, to file tariffs of reduced rates \u201crespecting freight movements similar to the preferred movements.\u201d Those non-compulsory reductions, sanctioned by section 9, are not ultimately borne by the companies whose tolls are affected by them, as by that section provision is made for the transfer of that burden to the Dominion Government, the Minister of Railways and Canals being required, at the end of each year, to pay to the companies availing themselves of the privileges of the section the difference, as certified by the Board of Railway Commissioners, between the amount which would have been payable in normal tolls but for the tariffs filed under it, and the sums actually \u201creceived under those tariffs.\u201d The question, whether the compulsory reductions under sections 3 and 4 applied (as shippers in the \u201cselect territory\u201d contended) to joint tolls in respect of \u201cmovements\u201d over joint routes through Saint John or Ste. Rosalie, or whether (as contended by the Canadian National Railway) they affected only \u201cmovements\u201d of traffic routed over the Canadian National Railways from point of origin to point of destination, was submitted to the Board of Railway Commissioners for determination, and the adjudication by the Board in the sense adverse to the contention of the railway company is formally embodied in the two orders now under appeal. The appeal raises the question whether the orders are within the jurisdiction of the Board.\nHeld that, when the question at issue is examined by the light of the preamble, of the declarations in the body of the statute and of the railway situation of the Maritime provinces, \u201cmovements of freight traffic\u201d originating on the \u201cEastern lines\u201d and passing over joint routes by way of Ste. Rosalie, established at the date of the passing of the Act, are \u201cpreferred movements\u201d within the meaning of sections 3 and 4; if such movements fall within the definition of \u201cpreferred movements,\u201d then the tariffs of tolls in force respecting them became subject to cancellation and reduction on the passing of the Act, and all persons and companies concerned in the preparation and publication of such tariffs were obliged by section 3 to concur in such cancellation, and in the substitution therefor of tariffs of statutory tolls; and the Board was acting within the limits of its jurisdiction in pronouncing the orders under consideration; but as regards the joint routes by way of Saint John, the orders of the Board are not within the ambit of its powers.\nHeld, also, that the question stated in the order giving leave to appeal is one of jurisdiction within the meaning of the Railway Act. The first of the above mentioned orders of the Board, in explicit terms, applies the compulsory reduction provided for by ss. 3 and 4 tariffs for the through routes in question and the second does the same thing in effect. Therefore, if such tariffs do not fall within ss. 3 and 4, then, by force of s. 7, the Board of Railway Commissioners is debarred from applying to them the principles of those sections. Where by statute the Board is given authority to make orders of a certain class in a defined type of case, and is disabled from making such orders in other cases, the question whether, in given circumstances, a case has arisen in which an order of that class can lawfully be made by the Board under the statute, is a question of competence\u2014that is to say, a question of jurisdiction within the meaning of the Railway Act.\nAPPEAL from two orders of the Board of Railway (Commissioners for Canada on a question of the jurisdiction of the Board.\nThe question to be considered is defined in the order granting leave to appeal and is stated at the beginning of the judgment now reported. E. Lafleur K.C. and A. Fraser K.C. for the appellant.\nC. B. Smith K.C. for the respondents: The province of Nova Scotia, the Halifax Board of Trade and the Saint John Board of Trade.\nF. R. Taylor K.C. for the respondent: The province of New Brunswick.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and E. P. Flintoft for the respondent: The Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The question to be considered is defined in the order granting leave to appeal in these terms:\nHad the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada power or jurisdiction under the Maritime Freight Rates Act, 1927, or under the Railway Act, 1919, or under both the said Acts, to make\n(1) (a) as to St. John.\n(b) as to Ste. Rosalie.\nOrder of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada numbered 39348?\n(2) (a) as to St. John.\n(b) as to Ste. Rosalie.\nOrder of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada numbered 39349?\nThe orders mentioned are dated the 14th of July, 1927, and are as follows:\u2014\n(The first, no. 39348.)\nThe Board orders that the Canadian National Railway Co. will forthwith publish tariffs of through rates by Saint John and Ste. Rosalie, from points in the Maritime Provinces through stations in Canada beyond eastern lines. Said through rates to be the rates in existence between such points on June 30, 1927, less approximately 20 per cent as provided in section 3 of c. 44, 17 Geo. V.\n(The second no. 39349.)\nThe Board orders that the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. and the Canadian National Railways be, and they are hereby directed to publish forthwith joint tariffs naming through rates from points in the Maritime provinces to stations west thereof, in Canada, via Saint John and Ste. Rosalie Junction which will be the same as published between the same points via the Canadian National Railways direct: such tariff to cover all traffic and the same territorial application as existed June 30, 1927.\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Co. assents to and supports these orders. The Canadian National Railway Co. seeks to rescind them. The lines of the Canadian National Railways run from Sydney, Halifax and other places in Nova Scotia through Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and eastern Quebec by way of Moncton, Levis, Diamond Junction and Ste. Rosalie to stations in central and western Canada. The Canadian National Railway Co. also owns and operates a line of railway between Moncton and Saint John. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. owns and operates a railway line which extends from Saint John to Montreal, with a branch running to Ste. Rosalie. Both of these railway systems directly or indirectly connect the Maritime Provinces with all the commercially important sections of Canada, west of these provinces.\nFor many years facilities have existed for interchange of freight traffic between the two systems of railway at St. John and Ste. Rosalie (a station near Montreal), which came to be designated in common speech as the Saint John and Ste. Rosalie \u201cgateways.\u201d\nIn consequence of these facilities, for some years prior to 1925, shipments originating on the lines of the Canadian National Railways, in the Maritime Provinces, could be routed, first, over the Canadian National Railways as far as Saint John or Ste. Rosalie, and thence over the Canadian Pacific Railway to their destination; and, as regards goods shipped to destinations reached by both railways there existed, as the Chairman of the Board of Railway Commissioners observes, parity of rates for three classes of routes; first, over the Canadian National Railways direct, second, over the Canadian National Railways to Saint John and thence by the Canadian Pacific Railway, and third over the Canadian National Railways to Ste. Rosalie and thence over the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nIn 1925 the Canadian National Railway Co. published supplementary tariffs, which, to quote the chairman of the Board, purported, as to classes of traffic affected by them \u201cto eliminate the alternate routings by way of Saint John and Ste. Rosalie,\u201d and the Board by its order of October 19, 1926 (no. 38275), disallowed the \u201cprovisions\u201d of these supplements \u201cin so far as they proposed to eliminate routings via Saint John and Ste. Rosalie.\u201d The learned Chairman says that the effect of this order \u201cwas to restore the parity of rates\u201d mentioned above. This was the situation when the Maritime Freight Rates Act of 1927 was passed. In explaining the provisions of the Act, the phrase \u201cEastern lines\u201d will frequently be used, and it is convenient at this place to quote textually section 2 of the Act which gives the meaning of that expression.\nFor the purposes of this Act the lines of railway now operated as a part of the Canadian National Railways and situated within the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, and the lines of railway, similarly operated, in the province of Quebec extending from the southern provincial boundary near Matapedia and near Courchesne to Diamond Junction and Levis are collectively designated as the \u201cEastern lines.\u201d\nFor a similar reason, section 8 should also be mentioned, which defines the phrase \u201cselect territory,\u201d as including Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island in addition to the localities on \u201cthe lines in the province of Quebec mentioned in section 2.\u201d\nThe Act, by section 3, requires the cancellation of tolls in force at its date (which we shall speak of as normal tolls), in respect of the \u201cmovements of freight traffic\u201d described as \u201cpreferred movements,\u201d and the substitution therefor of tariffs of reduced tolls (which we shall refer to as the statutory tolls). The \u201cpreferred movements\u201d comprise three classes, first, of local traffic between points on the \u201cEastern lines,\u201d second, of export traffic destined overseas between points on the \u201cEastern lines\u201d and ocean ports on the \u201cEastern lines,\u201d and third, of westbound traffic originating on the \u201cEastern lines,\u201d and extending westward beyond those lines.\nAs respects the first and second of these classes of \u201cpreferred movements,\u201d the statutory tolls are ascertained by making a deduction from the normal tolls of approximately twenty per cent. As respects the third class of such movements, the statutory rate is ascertained by making a deduction, also of twenty per cent, but, in this case, the deduction takes effect only upon that part of the \u201cthrough rate,\u201d which the statute in section 4 describes as the \u201cEastern lines proportion of\u201d that rate. The statute also provides for the non-compulsory reduction of rates by companies, other than those concerned with the \u201cEastern lines,\u201d which own or operate railways \u201cin or extending into the select territory.\u201d Such companies, by section 9, are permitted, in order to \u201cmeet\u201d the compulsory statutory rates, to file tariffs of reduced rates \u201crespecting freight movements similar to the preferred movements.\u201d\nIt is part of the scheme of the Act that these non-compulsory reductions, sanctioned by section 9, shall not be ultimately borne by the companies whose tolls are affected by them; and by that section provision is made for the transfer of that burden to the Dominion Government, the Minister of Railways and Canals being required, at the end of each year, to pay to the companies availing themselves of the privileges of the section the difference, as certified by the Board of Railway Commissioners, between the amount which would have been payable in normal tolls, but for the tariffs filed under it, and the sums actually \u201creceived under those tariffs.\u201d\nAfter the Act came into force, a controversy arose on the question whether the compulsory reductions under sections 3 and 4 applied (as shippers in the \u201cselect territory\u201d contended) to joint tolls in respect of \u201cmovements\u201d over joint routes through Saint John or Ste. Rosalie, or whether (as contended by the Canadian National Railways) they affected only \u201cmovements\u201d of traffic routed over the Canadian National Railways from point of origin to point of destination. This dispute came before the Board of Railway Commissioners for determination, and the adjudication by the Board in the sense adverse to this contention of the Railway Company is formally embodied in the two orders now under appeal.\nThe appeal raises the question whether the orders are within the jurisdiction of the Board. In passing upon that question none of the operative sections of the Act can be ignored; but it appears to us that the critical question (which must of course be examined by the light of the preamble, of the declarations in the body of the statute, and of the railway situation of the Maritime Provinces as summarily sketched above), is whether or not \u201cmovements of freight traffic\u201d originating on the \u201cEastern lines\u201d and passing over joint routes by way of Saint John, or joint routes by way of Ste. Rosalie, established at the date of the passing of the Act are \u201cpreferred movements\u201d within the meaning of sections 3 and 4. If such movements fall within the definition of \u201cpreferred movements,\u201d then the tariffs of tolls in force respecting them became subject to cancellation and reduction on the passing of the Act, and all persons and companies concerned in the preparation and publication of such tariffs were obliged by-section 3 to concur in such cancellation, and in the substitution therefor of tariffs of statutory tolls; and the Board was acting within the limits of its jurisdiction in pronouncing the orders under consideration.\nWe have come to the conclusion that in relation to the joint routes through Ste. Rosalie, the Board had jurisdiction to pronounce the orders under appeal; but as regards the joint routes by way of Saint John, our conclusion is that the orders of the Board are not within the ambit of its powers. The reading of the statute which governed the Board, in applying these orders to joint routes by way of St. John, is open, in our opinion to insurmountable objections; objections which do not proceed upon niceties of interpretation, but upon the unmistakeable effect of the substantive enactments of the Act.\nBefore entering upon an analysis of the operative sections some pertinent considerations drawn from the general features of the statute should be emphasized.\nAs appears from recitals and declarations in the preamble and in the body of the Act, the statutory rates, whether compulsory under section 3 and 4, or non-compulsory under section 9, are envisaged by the statute not as providing a fair return for railway services, but as arbitrary rates, established with the design of affording special \u201cstatutory advantages to persons\u2019 and industries\u201d in the \u201cselect territory\u201d; it was therefore considered just to transfer from the railway companies to the Dominion Treasury the burden of reductions authorized by section 9, which in the legal sense are non-compulsory, but, which it was recognized, might be exacted from the companies concerned, by the force of competition. It should also be observed, that the only enactment of the Act which confers a right of compensation upon railway companies (other than those concerned in the operation of the \u201cEastern lines\u201d) in respect of reductions sanctioned by the Act is the provision in section 9 already mentioned and that provision relates only to non-compulsory reductions authorized by the section. Indemnity to companies in respect of loss of revenue arising from a compulsory reduction is not provided for and not contemplated by the Act.\nSufficient perhaps has been said to make it evident that a decision supporting the validity of the orders of the Board would necessarily rest upon the view that the obligatory provisions of sections 3 and 4 are, in relation to the tariffs in question, binding upon the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. with the same force and to the same extent as they affect the persons and companies concerned in the preparation and publication of tariffs of rates for the \u201cEastern lines.\u201d But the point is of cardinal importance and it is perhaps desirable to develop it a little further. If movements over these routes are \u201cpreferred movements,\u201d then all persons and companies concerned in the joint rates applicable to them are required by section 3 to concur in, first, the cancellation of the existing tariffs, and second, the substitution of statutory tariffs therefor. There is nothing in the section which lends colour to the suggestion that the cancellation of existing tariffs within the purview of that section, that is to say the cancellation of tariffs of rates for \u201cpreferred movements,\u201d can, in any instance, be optional with one or more of the parties concerned. If a given movement is a \u201cpreferred movement\u201d then the duty of all parties interested in the appropriate tariff, both as to cancellation and as to reduction, is by the unequivocal words of the section, an absolute duty. If a given movement is not within the class of \u201cpreferred movements,\u201d then the section has no application to rates chargeable in respect of it; and by virtue of section 7, the Board is disabled from either requiring, or sanctioning, for such a movement, a rate determined according to the arbitrary standard of the statute. If, therefore, the joint routes in question by way of Saint John and St. Rosalie are preferential routes, within the operation of sections 3 and 4, it was as much the duty of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company as of the officials of the \u201cEastern lines\u201d to concur in the cancellation of the existing tariffs and the substitution of statutory tariffs; and, if not, the Board had no jurisdiction either to require or to authorize either substitution or cancellation.\nThe necessary effect, therefore, as observed already, of the view of the Board, that such movements are \u201cpreferred movements,\u201d is that the Canadian Pacific Railway Co\u2019s. share in the joint toll is subject, as well as the share of the \u201cEastern lines,\u201d to the statutory reduction, a reduction in respect of which no compensation is provided under the Act. This would be incompatible with the policy which dictated section 9, because it seems impossible to reconcile the policy of compensating for losses of revenue arising from non-compulsory reductions, due to economic pressure, with the policy of withholding compensation for losses arising from reductions imposed by express statutory compulsion. It is not less difficult to reconcile such a policy with the declarations above referred to, touching the inadequacy of the statutory rates as remuneration for the services to which they apply.\nComing now to the verbal structure of sections 3 and 4. The controversy turns largely upon the effect of section 4, as will now be apparent from what has been said, and particularly upon the meaning to be ascribed to sub-paragraph 4, 1 (b), which is in these words:\u2014\nTraffic moving outward, westbound, all rail\u2014From points on the Eastern lines westbound to points in Canada beyond the limit to the Eastern lines at Diamond Junction or Levis; for example, Moncton to Montreal,\u2014the twenty per cent reduction shall be based upon the Eastern lines proportion of the through rate or in this example upon the rate applicable from Moncton west as far as Diamond Junction or Levis.\nThe description of the through westbound routes\nfrom points on eastern lines westbound to points in Canada beyond the limit of the \u201cEastern lines\u201d at Diamond Junction or Levis.\nis perhaps not quite free from ambiguity. When, however, the sub-paragraph is read as a whole, there is little room for dispute that the only routes contemplated by it are routes passing through Diamond Junction or Levis. In the concrete example given, the reduction is calculated by reference to \u201cthe rate applicable from Moncton west as far as Diamond Junction or Levis.\u201d As designating part of a route from Moncton to Montreal which touches neither Diamond Junction nor Levis, this does not seem a very appropriate phrase. The only routes from points on the \u201cEastern lines\u201d which carry westbound traffic through Diamond Junction or Levis, are over the Canadian National lines. But it is more important to observe that the\nrate applicable from Moncton West as far as Diamond Junction or Levis is given as the equivalent of the Eastern lines proportion of the through rate for the route from Moncton to Montreal, or, to follow the natural reading of the words,\n\u201cthe proportion\u201d of the through rate earned by the transport service on the \u201cEastern lines.\u201d\nIt is impossible to suppose that the words in this paragraph were selected with a view to describing a route which deviates from the \u201cEastern lines\u201d at any point east of Diamond Junction or Levis.\nBut the matter does not rest here. By section 6 it is declared that\nthe reductions herein authorized * * * shall be borne by the Eastern lines.\nIt is true that the sentence in which this declaration occurs is dealing with a matter of accounting as between the \u201cEastern lines\u201d and the Canadian National Railways generally. But the decisive point is that the reductions (they can be none other than the reductions authorized by section 3), are treated by the section as a charge upon the revenues of the Canadian National Railways, to be met, in case of deficit, by a special parliamentary appropriation. In view of the fact that this is the sole provision dealing with the ultimate incidence of the reductions authorized by section 3, it seems impossible to doubt that all such reductions were envisaged by the legislature as reductions affecting tolls or parts of tolls belonging to the Canadian National Railways as earned by a transport service on the \u201cEastern lines.\u201d\nOn behalf of the respondent, the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., a point is made which must be noticed. Movements of freight traffic, by way of joint routes through Saint John, if not \u201cpreferred movements\u201d within sections 3 and 4, are, it is argued, \u201cmovements similar to preferred movements,\u201d within the meaning of section 9. While this may be unobjectionable as an application of this particular phrase, found in section 9, when taken by itself it does not advance the argument of the respondents. Section 9 applies only to tariffs filed by some company other than the companies concerned with the \u201cEastern lines\u201d or the Canadian National Railways, and the frame of that section clearly shows that it does not contemplate a tariff of tolls which are subject to apportionment between connecting companies. The difference between normal tolls and tolls under tariffs filed under that section is payable to the company in its entirety; there is no provision for apportionment. The company filing the tariff is treated as the only company concerned. This right, under section 9, evidently could have no possible operation or, indeed, meaning, as applied to tolls in respect of joint routes by way of Saint John. The substance of the contention is that, by the joint application of ss. 3, 4 and 9, joint rates, which are not within the operation of ss. 3 and 4 alone, or within the operation of section 9, alone, can be subjected to a reduction (bringing them into conformity with the statutory rates in respect of corresponding movements over the Canadian National Railways) which, as affecting the share of the Eastern lines in the joint rate, is compulsory, but, as affecting that of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, is voluntary. The learned Chairman of the Board appears to have been influenced by this argument in arriving at the view expressed by him, that the assent of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. to the orders impeached satisfactorily meets the objection that the Board has no jurisdiction under the Act to exact from the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., any compulsory reduction of any rate in which it is interested.\nThe conclusive answer to these contentions is manifest from what has already been said. The obligation imposed by section 3 has no relation to any tariffs except tariffs of tolls chargeable in respect of \u201cpreferred movements.\u201d Upon tolls in respect of other movements, the statutory reduction under that section cannot take effect; and as regards such tolls, no reduction is required, nor is any authorized, save only those sanctioned by section 9. Movements over joint routes by way of Saint John not being \u201cpreferred movements,\u201d the Board, let it be said again, is without jurisdiction either to direct or to sanction the establishment of rates in respect of them which are ascertained according to the special rule laid down in the statute.\nThese considerations (leading to the conclusion that the Board\u2019s orders, in so far as they affect tolls chargeable for joint routes by way of Saint John, cannot be supported) have for the most part no application to joint routes by way of Ste. Rosalie. Ste. Rosalie is a station near Montreal, a considerable distance west of \u201cselect territory,\u201d and is reached by the Canadian Pacific Railway Co\u2019s. line running from Saint John to Montreal direct, as well as by the Canadian National Railways lines running from Moncton to Montreal by way of Diamond Junction and Levis. Movements of traffic originating at points on the \u201cEastern lines,\u201d and routed over the Canadian National Railways by way of Diamond Junction or Levis to Ste. Rosalie, and thence by the Canadian Pacific Railway, are within the scope of the definition of westbound \u201cpreferred movements\u201d contained in section 4 (1) b. We encounter in this case, none of the difficulties which meet us, as noted above, when endeavouring to apply this definition to movements over joint routes by way of Saint John, As movements by way of Ste. Rosalie over the Canadian National Railways pass through Diamond Junction or Levis, the \u201cEastern lines proportion\u201d of the through rate is that attributable to the haul as far as Diamond Junction or Levis. Every element of the definition is satisfied. Such movements are, therefore, \u201cpreferred movements\u201d within the meaning of section 3, unless by reason of something in that section or elsewhere in the Act it appears that they are not such within the true intendment of the legislation. Section 3, as applied to such movements, would impose upon the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., as well as upon the persons and companies concerned with the preparation of tariffs for the \u201cEastern lines,\u201d the duty of concurring in the cancellation of the joint tariffs applicable, and in the substitution of the statutory tariffs, ascertained by appying the statutory reduction calculated according to the rule laid down by sub-paragraph (b) of section 4. As we have seen, such a calculation would present no difficulty. Movements over joint routes by way of Ste. Rosalie appear, therefore, to be \u201cpreferred movements\u201d within the meaning of ss. 3 and 4, when those sections are read and construed according to the ordinary and natural meaning of the words employed, nor is such a result out of harmony with the other provisions of the Act, or with any feature of the parliamentary scheme as disclosed by the statute. The compulsion directed against the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. does not affect the share of that company in the joint rate, because the whole of the statutory reduction falls upon the part of the rate belonging to the Canadian National Railways. No difficulty arises therefore as to compensation, and the ultimate incidence of the reductions is provided for by section 6. Moreover, the effect of this view is to maintain unimpaired and in full operation the transfer facilities at Ste. Rosalie; and this construction is in perfect consonance with the spirit of the provisions of the Railway Act.\nIt remains to discuss some arguments, founded upon general considerations, advanced in support of the contentions of the respondents, and, in the main, accepted by the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nWe are urged to reject the appellant company\u2019s contentions in relation to both the Saint John and the Ste. Rosalie \u201cgateway\u201d on the ground that acceptance of them would have the effect of defeating the purpose of the statute, which, it is contended, is disclosed either explicitly or inferentially by the preamble coupled with section 8\u2014to provide some relief for the industries of the Maritime Provinces from the oppressive costs of transport which were incident to the marketing of their products in central or western Canada. Then it was pressed upon us with great emphasis that it could not have been the intention of Parliament to deprive those industries of the advantages due to the existence of competitive and alternative routes by way of Saint John and Ste. Rosalie before the passing of the Act, which again, it is said, would be the practical result of adopting the appellant company\u2019s construction of the Act. We need not now concern ourselves with these considerations in so far as they relate exclusively to Ste. Rosalie, but in so far as they relate to the Saint John \u201cgateway,\u201d they must be considered.\nAt the date of the passing of the Act, as we have seen, joint tariffs were in force applicable to joint routes through both \u201cgateways.\u201d Shippers in the select territory, as in other parts of Canada, are, it must be conceded, entitled to enjoy the benefit of the provisions of the Railway Act as to joint tariffs and joint routes. For the Maritime Provinces, it is insisted, these provisions, as applied in the orders of the Board of Railway Commissioners in relation to both \u201cgateways\u201d had, prior to the passing of the statute, a special value as securing the benefits of competition in railway service and as securing an alternative route in the event of transport over one route being interrupted or unduly impeded.\nOwing to the manner of distribution of railway lines in the Maritime Provinces, the right of routing traffic through both these groups of joint routes is, it is argued, for these industries, an almost invaluable privilege; and the loss of that privilege would, it is further argued, in substance, result from the construction advocated by the appellant company. And thus to take away this privilege, it is said, would have the effect of investing the Canadian National Railways with a virtual monopoly of westbound traffic. The value attributed to these joint routes, by the people of the Maritime Provinces was, it is said, notorious, and it is impossible to suppose, it is argued, that Parliament, while bestowing with one hand the benefit of reduced rates for traffic over the Canadian National Railways exclusively, or over the Canadian Pacific Railway exclusively, was, with the other, withdrawing from the Maritime Provinces the right to enjoy at the same time the advantages which they believed to flow from the maintaining of these joint routes.\nThese considerations, as presented in argument, seemed in themselves to lack neither versimilitude nor weight; and although they are less weighty, as applied to the Saint John \u201cgateway\u201d alone, still, given operative sections fairly capable, when the Act is read as a whole, of the construction adopted by the Board, it is undeniable that they might provide forcible arguments in support of the respondents\u2019 contentions. Indeed, if, as is suggested, the policy giving birth to the legislation was broadly conceived with the view of redressing commercial disadvantages affecting the select territory by reason of its geographical situation, by granting, in the phrase of section 8, \u201cstatutory advantages in rates to persons and industries\u201d in that territory, it would not be difficult to understand a legislative scheme permitting shippers in that territory to enjoy at one and the same time the benefits of the statutory standard together with the option of routing their shipments by either of the two \u201cgateways.\u201d\nThe appeal to these general considerations, however, rather assumes the possession by this court of an authority which is not vested in it as a court of law. The function of this court is to give effect to the intention of the legislature, as disclosed by the language selected for the expression of that intention. Whatever views may have inspired the policy of a statute, it is no part of the function of a court of law to enlarge, by reference to such views, even if they could be known with certainty, the scope of the operative parts of the enactment in which the legislature has set forth the particular means by which its policy is to be carried into effect. If the language employed is fairly open to a given construction, then the policy of the Act, as disclosed by the statute itself, read in light of the known circumstances, in which it was passed, may legitimately be called in aid. But as already observed, the language of the operative sections of the Act before us, when fairly read, does not lend itself to the construction advocated by the respondents in so far as it affects the Saint John \u201cgateway.\u201d And, indeed, if the meaning of the language employed by the legislature to express its intention (in those sections) were less unambiguous than it is, one can find little that could, even then, be adduced in support of the respondents\u2019 position, in the recitals and declarations in the preamble and the body of the Act, on which they also rely, when the effect of these is clearly apprehended.\nThe preamble professes to be for the most part a summary of the relevant portions of the report of a Royal Commission of September, 1926, through which, as it recites, Parliament has been advised that the Intercolonial Railway was designed, inter alia, to afford to Maritime merchants, traders and manufacturers the larger market of the whole Canadian people; but that in \u201cdetermining\u201d the construction of the railway, commercial considerations were subordinated to considerations of a national, Imperial, and strategic character, which dictated a longer route than would otherwise have been necessary, and that, to this extent,\nthe cost of the railway should be borne by the Dominion and not by the traffic which might pass over the line.\nThe preamble proceeds:\u2014\nAnd whereas the Commission has, in such report, made certain recommendations respecting transportation and freight rates, for the purpose of removing a burden imposed upon the trade and commerce of such provinces since 1912, which, the Commission finds, in view of the pronouncements and obligations undertaken at Confederation, it was never intended such commerce should bear; and whereas it is expedient that effect should be given to such recommendations, in so far as it is reasonably possible so to do without disturbing unduly the general rate structure in Canada.\nTo the recitals in the preamble there should be added the declaration contained in s. 8:\u2014\nThe purpose of this Act is to give certain statutory advantages in rates to persons and industries in the Maritime provinces.\nIt will be observed that the recitals in so far as they are pertinent, may be summed up in the proposition that, by reason of the circumstances attending the institution of the Intercolonial Railway system, \u201cthe cost of the Railway\u201d should be borne by the Dominion, and not by the traffic on the line, in so far as that cost is due to national, Imperial and strategic considerations, as contradistinguished from commercial considerations, and that certain recommendations founded upon this view in the report of the Royal Commission ought to receive effect.\nThe report of the Royal Commission was not referred to in argument; although strictly, in view of the preamble, it would not be improper to consult it. It seems to contain nothing which gives additional strength to the respondents\u2019 argument. The recommendations relate only to reductions of tolls chargeable by the Canadian National Railways. The reference to other railways is limited to a single sentence, in which it is suggested that the legitimate interests of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. cannot be ignored. It will be observed also that the language of s. 8 is very guarded. The purpose of the Act is declared to be to give \u201ccertain statutory advantages in rates.\u201d\nThere is nothing here pointing to an application of the principle of compulsory reduction of rates broader than that prescribed according to the fair reading of ss. 3 and 4. There is no hint of an all-round reduction of rates in respect of all westbound through routes. It was assumed, no doubt, that the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. would be compelled, by pressure of competition, to take advantage of the privilege given by s. 9, but nothing in the preamble, or in s. 8, supplies a juridical ground for deducing an intention to apply the principle of that section to the joint routes by way of St. John.\nIt was argued by the respondents that the question stated in the order giving leave to appeal is not a question of jurisdiction within the meaning of the Railway Act. The first of the above-mentioned orders, in explicit terms, applies the compulsory reduction provided for by ss. 3 and 4 to tariffs for the through routes in question. The second does the same thing in effect. It follows, from what has already been said, that if such tariffs do not fall within ss. 3 and 4, then, by force of s. 7, the Board of Railway Commissioners is debarred from applying to them the principles of those sections. It seems to be sufficient to say that where by statute the Board is given authority to make orders of a certain class in a defined type of case, and is disabled from making such orders in other cases, the question whether, in given circumstances, a case has arisen in which an order of that class can lawfully be made by the Board under the statute, is a question of competence\u2014that is to say, a question of jurisdiction within the meaning of the Railway Act.\nThe orders of the Board are set aside in so far as they relate to tariffs for joint rates by way of Saint John; in other respects the appeal is dismissed. As success is divided, there will be no costs of the appeal.\nThe questions stated in the order giving leave to appeal are answered as follows:\u2014\nQuestion 1 (a) as to Saint John,\u2014No.\nQuestion 1 (b) as to Ste. Rosalie,\u2014Yes.\nQuestion 2 (a) as to Saint John,\u2014No.\nQuestion 2 (b) as to Ste. Rosalie,\u2014Yes.\nMaritime Freight Rates Act\n3. (1) All persons or companies controlling, or concerned in the preparation and issue of tariffs of tolls to be charged in respect of the movements of freight traffic, whether on behalf of His Majesty or otherwise, upon or over the Eastern lines specified in section four of this Act, and hereinafter called \u201cpreferred movements,\u201d are hereby authorized and directed upon and after the first day of July, 1927, to\u2014\n(a) Cancel all existing freight tariffs in respect of such preferred movements\n(b) Substitute other tariffs for the tariffs so cancelled showing a reduction in such tariffs of approximately twenty per cent;\n4. (1) (b) Traffic moving outward, westbound, all rail\u2014From points on the Eastern lines westbound to points in Canada beyond the limit of the Eastern lines at Diamond Junction or Levis; for example, Moncton to Montreal\u2014the twenty per cent reduction shall be based upon the Eastern lines proportion of the through rate or in this example upon the rate applicable from Moncton west as far as Diamond Junction or Levis.\n6. For accounting purposes, but without affecting the management and operation of any of the Eastern lines, the revenues and expenses of the Eastern lines (includes the reductions herein authorized which shall be borne by the Eastern lines) shall be kept separately from all other accounts respecting the construction, operation or management of the Canadian National Railways. In the event of any deficit occurring in any Railway fiscal year in respect of the Eastern lines the amount of such deficit shall be included in a separate item in the estimates submitted to Parliament for or on behalf of the Canadian National Railways at the first session of Parliament following the close of such fiscal year.\n7. The rates specified in the tariffs of tolls, in this Act provided for, in respect of preferred movements, shall be deemed to be statutory rates, not based on any principle of fair return to the railway for services rendered in the carriage of traffic. No argument shall accordingly be made, nor considered in respect of the reasonableness of such rates with regard to other rates, nor of other rates having regard to the rates authorized by this Act.\n8. The purpose of this Act is to give certain statutory advantages in rates to persons and industries in the three provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, and in addition upon the lines in the province of Quebec mentioned in section two (together hereinafter called \u201cselect territory\u201d), accordingly the Board shall not approve nor allow any tariffs which may destroy or prejudicially affect such advantages in favour of persons or industries located elsewhere than in such select territory.\n9. (1) Other companies owning or operating lines of railway in or extending into the select territory may file with the Board tariffs of tolls respecting freight movements similar to the preferred movements, meeting the statutory rates referred to in section seven of this Act. The Board, subject to all the provisions of the Railway Act, respecting tariff of tolls, not inconsistent with this Act, shall approve the tariffs of tolls filed under this section.\n(2) The provisions of subsection two of section three and of sections seven and eight of this Act shall apply to the tariffs of tolls filed under this section.\n(3) The Board on approving any tariff under this section shall certify the normal tolls which but for this Act would have been effective and shall, in the case of each company, at the end of each calendar year promptly ascertain and certify to the Minister of Railways and Canals the amount of the difference between the tariff tolls and the normal tolls above referred to on all traffic moved by the company during such year under the tariff so approved. The Company shall be entitled to payment of the amount of the difference so certified, and the Minister of Railways and Canals shall submit such amount to Parliament if then in session (or if not, then at the first session following the end of such calendar year) as an item of the estimates of the Department of Railways and Canals.\nSolicitor for the appellant: George F.

W. Forbes by his will left property upon trust, after the death of a brother, \u201cto pay the one-half of the interest arising from said investments yearly to my brothers and sisters then living * * * and to the survivors or survivor of them so long as any one of my said brothers and sisters shall live and upon the death of the survivor of my said brothers and sisters to pay the whole of the principal * * * and the interest remaining to my next of kin, of the name \u2018Forbes\u2019 then living.\u201d The testator died a bachelor leaving as next of kin brothers and sisters, who all died leaving no descendants except one brother who left two daughters who survived the last surviving brother or sister of the testator. These daughters were living at the testator\u2019s death, but subsequently, and before the death of the testator\u2019s last surviving brother or sister, had married and become Mrs. P. and Mrs. R. respectively.\nHeld (reversing judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, [1927] 3 D.L.R. 70, and restoring judgment of Mellish J.) that the persons who took the principal and remaining interest under said bequest were the testator\u2019s nearest of kin in equal degree who bore the name \u201cForbes\u201d at the time of the death of the testator\u2019s last surviving brother or sister; the class was to be ascertained as at the period of distribution, and not as at the time of the testator\u2019s death; Mrs. P. and Mrs. R., not bearing the name \u201cForbes\u201d at the period of distribution, could not take. The principles of construction approved in Hutchinson v. National Refuges for Homeless and Destitute Children, [1920] A.C. 794, and Lucas-Tooth v. Lucas-Tooth, [1921] 1 A.C. 594, applied. Pyot v. Pyot, 1 Ves. Sr. 335, and Carpenter v. Bott, 15 Sim. 606, discussed and distinguished.\nAPPEAL by certain of the defendants from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1], which reversed the judgment of Mellish J. The question in dispute was with regard to the construction of a clause in a will. The clause in question and the material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note. The appeal was allowed.\nE. M. Macdonald K.C. for the appellant McKenzie Forbes (representing relatives of the testator, of the name \u201cForbes,\u201d living at the death of the testator\u2019s last surviving brother or sister).\nJ. H. MacQuarrie for the appellants MacQuarrie and Milne (representing, respectively, the estates of two deceased brothers of the testator who survived the testator).\nE. C. Phinney for the respondents Mrs. Perley and Mrs. Ruddick.\nJ. Ross K.C. for the respondent The Eastern Trust Company (trustee of testator\u2019s estate).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nJ. H. MacQuarrie for the appellants.\nJ. Ross K.C. for the respondent\nNewcombe J.\u2014John W. Forbes, the testator, died on 22nd March, 1893. We were informed at the hearing that he never was married. When he died, his next of kin were his surviving brothers (including his brother Hugh) and sisters, the last of whom, his sister Christine, died on 10th October, 1925. None of them left any descendants, except Hugh; he left two daughters, who are respondents; the one, Maria, who married Mr. Perley on 22nd November, 1898; the other, Isabel, who married Mr. Ruddick on 28th December, 1896. There is evidence of more remote collateral kindred of the name \u201cForbes\u201d residing in Scotland, and they are represented upon this appeal by McKenzie Forbes, one of their number.\nThe will, dated 30th December, 1892, has the following clause, which seems to be the only provision material to the case:\nAnd upon further trust after the death of my said brother, Roderick Alexander Forbes, to pay the one-half of the interest arising from said investments yearly to my brothers and sisters then living in equal proportions share and share alike, and to the survivors or survivor of them so long as any one of my said brothers and \u201csisters shall live and upon the death of the survivor of my said brothers and sisters to pay the whole of the principal of said investments and the interest remaining to my next of kin, of the name \u201cForbes\u201d then living.\nThe object of these proceedings is to ascertain who is entitled to receive the principal and interest bequeathed by this clause to the testator\u2019s next of kin of the name \u201cForbes\u201d living at the time thus indicated, and the immediate question is concerned with the interpretation. The case is put upon the assumption that the testator\u2019s nieces, upon their marriages, parted with their surname, and that each of them has since been known by the surname of her husband. Doe v. Plumptre[2].\nMellish J., the trial judge, was of the opinion that the testator meant his nearest of kin in equal degree who bore the name \u201cForbes\u201d at the time of the death of the last survivor of his brothers and sisters, share and share alike, and that the class was to be ascertained as at the period of distribution, and not as at the time of the testator\u2019s death; and, in the absence of sufficient evidence to identify these relatives, he directed an enquiry for the purpose of ascertaining who they were. He held, moreover, that the testator\u2019s nieces, Mrs. Perley and Mrs. Ruddick, not bearing the name \u201cForbes,\u201d did not qualify.\nUpon appeal this judgment was reversed. There was, however, a difference of opinion. The Chief Justice with whom Graham J. concurred, considered that the testator\u2019s next of kin should be determined as at the time of his death, excluding his brothers and sisters, and that therefore Mrs. Perley and Mrs. Ruddick, being then unmarried and bearing the name \u201cForbes,\u201d were entitled. He also intimated a doubt, arising out of the application of the case of Carpenter v. Bott[3], as to whether these ladies did not take, even if the class were to be ascertained as at the period of distribution.\nChisholm J. found evidence of still another intention. He thought that there were two conditions of qualification which must concur, next of kinship and possession of the name \u201cForbes,\u201d and he agreed with Mellish J. that the qualified class was to be ascertained as at the time of the death of the testator\u2019s last surviving brother or sister. Therefore he held that the testator\u2019s nieces, although they constituted at that time his next of kin, must fail, because not of the name \u201cForbes,\u201d and that the more remote relatives were likewise disentitled, because not true next of kin, and so he concluded for intestacy.\nHow is the class described by the testator in his will as \u201cmy next of kin of the name \u2018Forbes\u2019 then living\u201d to be ascertained? There are many authorities, but the principles of interpretation have recently been considered by the House of Lords in Hutchinson v. National Refuges for Homeless and Destitute Children[4], and in Lucas-Tooth v. Lucas-Tooth and others[5], and applying these principles, I have reached the conclusion that the judgment at the trial must be restored. I think the testator has, by the words of his will, sufficiently indicated that the class should be determined at the death of the survivor of his brothers and sisters. He could not have meant next of kin at the time of his death, because they were, as he anticipated, his brothers and sisters, and the bequest was to go only to persons who survived them. It is said that the will shows an intention to establish the class subject to an exception of the brothers and sisters, but there are no express words of exception or exclusion, and one would be surprised to find them, because such an exception would be as comprehensive as the class, and a gift to next of kin, excluding next of kin, is nonsense. Then I can see no justification for introducing into the gift of the residue, as would be necessary to maintain the respondent\u2019s contention, an implication that the next of kin mentioned should be those who would be the testator\u2019s next of kin at the time of his death if he should survive his brothers and sisters. Moreover, if you read the words \u201cnext of kin\u201d in the sense of the rule that prima facie the next of kin are to be ascertained at the death of the testator, you are apt to get a result which is contrary to the testator\u2019s manifest intention, for the qualification, \u201cof the name \u2018Forbes\u2019 then living\u201d, would upon that reading naturally have reference to the date of the testator\u2019s death and therefore mean the testator\u2019s brothers and sisters who were living at his death. This would seem to follow if the meaning alleged to be implied were expressed in the will; but an implied intention cannot well exist if it will not stand expression consistently with the context.\nAs was pointed out by the Lord Chancellor in the Lucas-Tooth Case[6], one must take care to regard the testator\u2019s intention, and not so to apply a canon of construction as to produce consequences contrary to that intention. The name \u201cForbes\u201d dominates the purpose of the gift, and evidently a claimant for this bequest must, if he is to succeed, \u201cbe of the name Forbes,\u201d whatever that expression means, upon, the death of the survivor of the testator\u2019s brothers and sisters. The claimant must then be living, and, if he is not required to be of the testator\u2019s next of kin at the time of his death, the clause must refer to next of kin at the time of distribution, which, moreover, is most natural, if that be the time for determining the other characteristics of the class. It is true that the words \u201cthen living\u201d in one aspect seem to point to a class of persons some of whom may not be living at the time fixed for the payment, but the inference to be drawn from that is, I think, overborne by the other considerations which I have mentioned. The case is within the application of the language of Lord Dunedin who, in his speech in the Lucas-Tooth Case[7], at p. 608, said:\nPrima facie the heir of A. is the person who holds that character when A. dies. If, however, the period of distribution is owing to the interposition of a life interest or by explicit direction postponed, and it is clear that the favoured person is only to be sought at the time of distribution, then it is legitimate to hold that the prima facie meaning is displaced and that the person indicated is he who would have the character of heir of A. if A. had really died at the date of the period of distribution. Everything, therefore, turns as Thesiger L.J. put it in Mortimer v. Slater[8], (for I do not read his judgment as a monograph on the word \u201cthen\u201d), on its being clear from the words used that the person is to be found, or the class selected, only when the succession opens.\nIf, as I hold, the testator has shown that he does not mean his next of kin living at his death, the words \u201cthen living\u201d serve to indicate in contradistinction the time when his next of kin, for the purposes of the gift, are to be ascertained.\nIn any event, since, referring to the death of the survivor of the testator\u2019s brothers and sisters, the bequest is to his then living next of kin of the name \u201cForbes,\u201d his nieces are not within the description, for they had parted with that name before the time set for ascertaining the class. If female next of kin can be admitted, they must be of the name \u201cForbes\u201d at the time directed for payment. There is no authority by which we are bound to substitute any such word as \u201cstock,\u201d \u201cblood\u201d or \u201cfamily\u201d for \u201cname,\u201d and to do so would, I think, be to fail in due regard to the testator\u2019s intention. Pyot v. Pyot[9], depends upon its own special considerations. Lord Hardwicke held the description in that case to refer, not to the actual bearing of the name \u201cPyot,\u201d but to the stock \u201cof the Pyots.\u201d There seems to have been some confusion as to what precisely was the language to be interpreted. The words \u201cof the Pyots\u201d are put in quotation in the Lord Chancellor\u2019s judgment, and, in a note to the report, it is stated that these were the words used and not \u201cof the name of the Pyots.\u201d The case is considered in the text of Mr. Jar-man\u2019s first edition, which has been reproduced by the learned authors of the 6th edition at pp. 1650 et seq. In Leigh v. Leigh[10], Lawrence J. says that, according to a manuscript note of the case which he had, the bequest was \u201cto my nearest relation of the name, not \u2018of Pyot,\u2019 but \u2018of the Pyots,\u2019\u201c and that that circumstance appears to weigh with Lord Hardwicke. Moreover, Thompson B., at p. 111 of the same case, says that the disposition was in favour of the testatrix\u2019s nearest relation of the name \u201cof the Pyots,\u201d adding \u201cso it appears in the Register\u2019s book; which I have examined; and not \u2018of Pyot\u2019\u201d. Therefore I think the Pyot Case[11] is distinguishable, and this apparently was the view of the Vice-Chancellor in Carpenter v. Bott[12], which was the case of a fund bequeathed in trust for the testator\u2019s next of kin \u201cof the surname of Crump,\u201d although it was held that these words were the equivalent in meaning of the expression interpreted in Pyot\u2019s Case11. But I may be permitted to doubt that the learned Vice-Chancellor would have gone the step further which would be necessary to substitute \u201cstock\u201d for \u201cname\u201d in the present case. Indeed if it were the testator\u2019s intention that the fund should go to a person named \u201cForbes,\u201d it is not easy to perceive by what other words he could more plainly have expressed that intention.\nAs to the reasoning of Chisholm J., I think he fails to recognize the effect of the description \u201cof the name \u2018Forbes\u2019 then living\u201d which, in my judgment, is intended to constitute a special class of next of kin, and his conclusion is moreover in conflict with the golden rule enunciated by Lord Esher that \u201cyou ought, if possible, to read the will so as to lead to a testacy, not to an intestacy.\u201d In re Harrison[13].\nI am therefore of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed, and that the judgment of Mellish J. should be restored. As to costs, they should be governed throughout by the same direction as in the court below\u2014to be paid out of the fund; and, for the Trust Company, as between solicitor and client.\nAppeal allowed.

La seule question que nous ayons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider, c\u2019est de savoir si la loi des accidents du travail s\u2019applique dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nThibault, lors de cet accident, nettoyait une des rues de la municipalit\u00e9 avec son cheval et sa voiture. C\u2019est le cheval d\u2019un tiers, lanc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pouvante, qui causa cet accident. Thibault fut frapp\u00e9 par la voiture que tra\u00eenait ce cheval, et il est mort de ses blessures le lendemain. La preuve ne nous \u00e9claire pas quant aux conditions de l\u2019engagement de Thibault. Le tr\u00e9sorier de la ville a fait des recherches afin de d\u00e9couvrir, si possible, une r\u00e9solution du conseil le nommant, mais ces recherches ont \u00e9t\u00e9 infructueuses. Cependant on admet que Thibault \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 permanent de l\u2019appelante, et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 tant de l\u2019heure, avec une l\u00e9g\u00e8re augmentation quand il fournissait son cheval et sa voiture.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s un \u00e9tat produit par le tr\u00e9sorier de la ville, Thibault aurait commenc\u00e9 son travail le ler mai 1923, et c\u2019\u00e9tait surtout au d\u00e9partement de la voirie, sous les ordres du contrema\u00eetre Harvey, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9. La ville de Jon-qui\u00e8res poss\u00e8de un aqueduc et des \u00e9gouts, et elle vend et distribue l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, soit pour l\u2019\u00e9clairage, soit pour la force motrice. Elle a \u00e9galement des machines mues par une force autre que celle de l\u2019homme et des animaux\u2014on mentionne un rouleau \u00e0 vapeur, un concasseur et un malaxeur \u2014et il y a naturellement une dynamo au d\u00e9partement de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9. Un t\u00e9moin dit que Thibault a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 pour faire marcher le concasseur et qu\u2019il l\u2019y a vu travailler, mais cela para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 au d\u00e9but de son engagement. Dans l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 de 1924, Harvey, le contrema\u00eetre de la voirie, employait Thibault pour faire le nettoyage des rues et aussi pour la r\u00e9paration des trottoirs en bois. Il dit qu\u2019il ne s\u2019est pas servi de machines pendant cet \u00e9t\u00e9. Bien que le travail de Thibault relev\u00e2t presque exclusivement du d\u00e9partement de la voirie, l\u2019\u00e9tat produit par le tr\u00e9sorier fait voir que, de temps \u00e0 autre, Thibault donnait un peu de temps aux autres d\u00e9partements. Harvey explique que lorsque le contrema\u00eetre du d\u00e9partement \u00e9lectrique lui demandait un homme, il y envoyait Thibault, quand il pouvait s\u2019en passer, pour une heure des fois, d\u2019autres fois pour une journ\u00e9e. No\u00ebl, le contrema\u00eetre du d\u00e9partement \u00e9lectrique, dit que Thibault a travaill\u00e9 pour lui lors de la construction des dynamos, et qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 occup\u00e9 \u00e0 cette construction du ler novembre 1923 au ler janvier 1924.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019a fait aucune constatation de fait, se contentant de dire que la demanderesse avait prouv\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations essentielles de sa d\u00e9claration. En vue du manque de pr\u00e9cision de la preuve testimoniale, il para\u00eet plus s\u00fbr de s\u2019en rapporter \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat produit au dossier, et qui est un extrait du livre de paye de la ville. Or cet \u00e9tat d\u00e9montre, je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, que l\u2019ouvrage pour lequel Thibault a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 relevait en tr\u00e8s grande partie du d\u00e9partement de la voirie, et que ce n\u2019est qu\u2019exceptionnellement qu\u2019il a travaill\u00e9 ailleurs que dans les rues. Ainsi, depuis le ler mai 1923 jusqu\u2019au 16 juillet 1924, Thibault a re\u00e7u les sommes suivantes comme prix de son travail: rues, $796.29; aqueduc, $39.62; \u00e9gouts, $32.15; d\u00e9partement \u00e9lectrique, $113.85; entretien des b\u00e2tisses \u201cet autres,\u201d $16.80. Pour la p\u00e9riode entre le ler janvier et le 16 juillet 1924, la disproportion est encore plus accentu\u00e9e, car on a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 Thibault $281.32 pour les rues; $20.27 pour l\u2019aqueduc; $13.55 pour les \u00e9gouts; $8.55 pour le d\u00e9partement \u00e9lectrique, et $13.35 pour entretien des b\u00e2tisses \u201cet autres\u201d.\nDans ces circonstances, la question qui se pose est de savoir si un journalier qui d\u2019ordinaire travaille dans les rues d\u2019une municipalit\u00e9, mais qui exceptionnellement a pu de temps \u00e0 autre faire de l\u2019ouvrage dans des d\u00e9partements municipaux o\u00f9 on fait usage de machines mues par une force autre que celle de l\u2019homme ou des animaux, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie des dispositions de la loi des accidents du travail lorsqu\u2019il lui arrive un accident pendant qu\u2019il fait son travail habituel dans les rues.\nCitons ici la disposition introductive et fondamentale de cette loi, l\u2019article 7321 S.R.Q., 1909. J\u2019en donne le texte tel qu\u2019il se lisait lors de l\u2019accident, en y comprenant les amendements jusqu\u2019\u00e0 cette date:\n7321. Les accidents survenus par le fait du travail, ou \u00e0 l\u2019occasion du travail, aux ouvriers, apprentis et employ\u00e9s occup\u00e9s dans l\u2019industrie du b\u00e2timent, dans les usines, manufactures et ateliers, et dans les chantiers de pierre, de bois ou de charbon; dans les entreprises de transports par terre ou par eau, de chargement ou de d\u00e9chargement, dans celles de gaz ou d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, de construction, de r\u00e9paration ou d\u2019entretien de chemins de fer ou tramways, d\u2019aqueducs, d\u2019\u00e9gouts, de canaux, de digues, de quais, de docks, d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9vateurs et de ponts; dans les mines, mini\u00e8res, carri\u00e8res, et, en outre, dans toute exploitation industrielle, dans laquelle sont fabriqu\u00e9es ou mises en oeuvre des mati\u00e8res explosives, ou dans laquelle il est fait usage d\u2019une machine mue par une force autre que celle de l\u2019homme ou des animaux, donnent droit, au profit de la victime ou de ses repr\u00e9sentants, \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions ci-apr\u00e8s.\nLa pr\u00e9sente loi peut \u00eatre cit\u00e9e sous le nom de Loi des accidents du travail de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et elle ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 l\u2019industrie agricole ni \u00e0 la navigation \u00e0 voile. (9 Ed. VII, c. 66, s. 1, et 8 Geo. V, c. 71, s. 1).\nLorsqu\u2019une corporation municipale entreprend ou fait ex\u00e9cuter elle-m\u00eame des travaux publics dans des conditions qui rendraient l\u2019entrepreneur sujet aux dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi, elle y devient soumise elle-m\u00eame. (10 Geo. V, c. 75, s. 1. Amendement de 1920).\nLe jugement de la cour d\u2019appel dit que\nla majorit\u00e9 des travaux pour lesquels la victime de l\u2019accident \u00e9tait engag\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante, tombaient, soit par leur nature, soit par la mani\u00e8re dont ils \u00e9taient ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, sous les dispositions de la Loi des accidents du travail, et que le travail particulier auquel \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 la victime au moment de l\u2019accident, quoique ne tombant pas sous cette loi, ne pouvait lui faire perdre \u00e0 lui, ou \u00e0 ses ayants cause, le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de cette loi \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait soumise.\nNous ne pouvons juger des conditions de l\u2019engagement de Thibault que par les travaux qu\u2019il a actuellement faits pour rappelante, et alors il m\u2019est impossible de dire, avec la cour d\u2019appel, que la majorit\u00e9 de ces travaux tombaient sous les dispositions de la loi des accidents du travail. Au contraire, la tr\u00e8s grande majorit\u00e9 de ces travaux, nous l\u2019avons vu, \u00e9taient des travaux dans les rues, sans machines, semblables \u00e0 l\u2019ouvrage que faisait Thibault lors de l\u2019accident, et qui, la cour d\u2019appel le reconna\u00eet, ne tombait pas sous la loi des accidents du travail. Le fait ici domine le droit, et je n\u2019ai pas besoin de discuter les d\u00e9cisions cit\u00e9es de part et d\u2019autre.\nCes d\u00e9cisions, du reste, me paraissent \u00eatre des arr\u00eats d\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Ainsi, dans la cause de Ferron v. Cit\u00e9 de Shawinigan[2], sur laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019appuie, il s\u2019agissait de trottoirs en b\u00e9ton qu\u2019on construisait avec l\u2019aide d\u2019un malaxeur m\u00fb \u00e0 la vapeur, et le gardien de nuit qui veillait aux travaux obtint de la cour d\u2019appel une indemnit\u00e9 pour accident de travail. De m\u00eame, dans Nicholaichook v. City of Westmount[3], que cite l\u2019appelante, la victime n\u2019\u00e9tait employ\u00e9e que pour de simples travaux de rues, semblables \u00e0 ceux que faisait Thibault, et la cour de r\u00e9vision n\u2019a pas eu \u00e9gard au fait que\nthe corporation may occasionally have operated a steam roller in its streets, and had a macadam mixer in its yard run by steam.\nCe qui importe en ces mati\u00e8res, c\u2019est la nature de l\u2019entreprise dans laquelle l\u2019ouvrier est occup\u00e9. Le l\u00e9gislateur, par l\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9ration de l\u2019article 7321, a reconnu que certaines entreprises entra\u00eenent pour l\u2019ouvrier un risque d\u2019accident contre lequel il a voulu le prot\u00e9ger. C\u2019est le risque professionnel. En dehors des entreprises \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es qui entra\u00eenent ce risque, l\u2019ouvrier accident\u00e9 ne peut obtenir une indemnit\u00e9 que suivant le droit commun, en \u00e9tablissant une faute \u00e0 la charge de son patron.\nPas plus que les individus, une municipalit\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9chappe \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e par la loi des accidents du travail, \u00e0 la condition, toutefois, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019une entreprise \u00e9nu-m\u00e9r\u00e9e dans l\u2019article 7321; et, \u00e0 cette fin, chaque entreprise de la municipalit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre envisag\u00e9e s\u00e9par\u00e9ment. Pour me servir des termes m\u00eames de l\u2019amendement de 1920, la municipalit\u00e9 est soumise \u00e0 cette loi quand elle\nentreprend ou fait ex\u00e9cuter elle-m\u00eame des travaux dans des conditions qui rendraient l\u2019entrepreneur sujet aux dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi,\net alors seulement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ceux de ses employ\u00e9s qui sont occup\u00e9s dans cette entreprise. Cette condition ne s\u2019est pas r\u00e9alis\u00e9e dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et il s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne peut invoquer cette loi.\nAvec toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence possible, je suis donc d\u2019avis de maintenir l\u2019appel et de renvoyer l\u2019action, avec d\u00e9pens dans toutes les cours en faveur de l\u2019appelante.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Casgrain, McDougall, Stairs & Casgrain.\nSoliciter for the respondent: J.

Munro et al\n1927: May 16, 17; 1927: June 17.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Newcombe, Rinfret and Lamont JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION\nReal property\u2014Trespass\u2014Action for trespass by cutting timber\u2014Plaintiff\u2019s title to the land\u2014Construction of deed\u2014Plaintiff\u2019s possession as ground of action.\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division[1], affirming the judgment of Byrne J. awarding the plaintiffs the sum of $2,491.48 damages assessed by the jury, in an action for trespass to land consisting in cutting timber upon it. The cutting complained of had been made on land known as the \u201cQueensbury Gore Lot,\u201d and the question for determination by this Court was whether the plaintiffs had shown such title to (or possibly, such possession of) that lot as gave them a status to maintain this action for trespass to it. An objection by defendants that trespass on that lot had not been sufficiently alleged in the statement of claim was held not to be open, in view of the course of the proceedings below.\nThe question of the plaintiffs\u2019 title to the said lot depended on the construction of a certain deed from the New Brunswick & Nova Scotia Land Company to Alexander Munro, Jr. The difficulty arose from certain words in the description in the deed. In this regard, the judgment of the Court (delivered by Anglin C.J.C.) said, in part, as follows:\n\u201cThe title of the grantors in that deed was not contested; nor was it suggested at bar that the plaintiffs were not vested with whatever title it conferred on the grantee. The sole issue in regard to the title was whether or not that deed conveyed the Queensbury Gore Lot.\n* * * * *\n\u201cAfter careful consideration of the plans and other relevant matters established by the voluminous evidence, we find it quite impossible to say that the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the deed from the New Brunswick & Nova Scotia Land Company to Alexander Munro, Jr., conveyed \u2018The Gore Lot\u2019 in the Parish of Queensbury.\u201d\nAs to the plaintiffs\u2019 right resting on possession, the Court said as follows:\n\u201cThe defendants have not attempted to prove any sort of title to the Queensbury Gore Lot or anything in the nature of a license to cut upon it. Assuming that that lot was not granted to Alexander Munro, Jr., title to it in the New Brunswick & Nova Scotia Land Company, if set up, and established, would not avail the defendants as against proof of possession by the plaintiffs. (Glenwood Lumber Co. v. Phillips[2]; The Winkfield[3]).\n* * * * * \u201cWhile the plaintiffs rested their claim on title and made no explicit allegation of possession of the locus of the trespass complained of, the defendants evidently regarded such possession as in issue because, in their amended statement of defence, they specifically pleaded that\nthe plaintiffs were not at any time * * * in possession of any land in the Parish of Queensbury.\n\u201cEvidence of possession was adduced by the plaintiffs at the trial without objection or contradiction and the issue of possession was fought out between the parties. As put by Mr. Justice White, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal:\nAs against the defendants, who showed no title whatever to the locus, the possession of the plaintiffs would be sufficient to entitle them to a verdict. It is true that the question of possession was not left to the jury. This was no doubt owing to the fact that neither party asked to have such a question submitted. A great deal of the time taken up by the trial was devoted to proof that the plaintiffs had possession. The evidence that they had such possession was so full and conclusive that had the jury been asked to find whether the plaintiffs had such possession and had answered such questions in the negative, such answer must, upon application to this Court, have been decided to be one which a jury could not reasonably have given under the evidence.\n\u201cThe Court of Appeal undoubtedly has the right to \u2018draw all inferences of fact not inconsistent with the finding of the jury and, if satisfied that it has before it all the\nmaterials necessary for finally determining the question in dispute, * * * may give judgment accordingly.\u2019 (3 Geo. V, c. 23, s. 4; N.B. Sup. Ct. Rules, 1909, 0. 40, r. 10; 0. 58, r. 4).\n\u201cThat Court found possession to be established and that finding cannot be successfully attacked.\u201d\nThe judgment concluded as follows:\n\u201cOn both grounds, that the plaintiffs had established title to the land in question and that they were in possession of it, asserting ownership, at the time of the trespass, the judgment appealed against must be affirmed.\u201d\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nJ. B. M. Baxter K.C. and J. J. F. Winslow K.C. for the appellants.\nP. J. Hughes K.C. for the respondents.\n[1] [1927] 1 D.L.R. 1200.\n[2] [1904] A.C. 405.\n[3] [1902] P. 42, at p. 54.\n",

The appellant contested the jurisdiction of the latter court on the ground that he was residing, practising as lawyer and carrying on business in the town of Roberval where all his assets were situate and that the competent court of jurisdiction under the Bankruptcy Act was the Superior Court in the district of Roberval.\nHeld that the Superior Court sitting in bankruptcy at Montreal had jurisdiction. According to s. 63, subs. 1d. of the Bankruptcy Act, the court having jurisdiction in bankruptcy matters in the province of Quebec is the Superior Court of the province, and, according to s. 64, subs. 5 of that Act \u201ceach province of Canada shall constitute for the purpose of this Act one bankruptcy district.\u201d So that the Superior Court sitting in any provincial judicial district has jurisdiction to hear a petition in bankruptcy served upon a debtor residing and doing business in any part of the province.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 42 K.B. 425) aff.

That the debtor does not come within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court under the Bankruptcy Act in the district of Montreal and that the latter court has no jurisdiction to hear the present petition;\n6. That the debtor is, as alleged in the said petition, resident, practicing and carrying on business in the town of Roberval, district of Roberval, where there is a competent court of jurisdiction under the Bankruptcy Act and before which he should have been summoned;\n7. That all the assets of the said debtor are situate in the said district of Roberval at a distance of more than four hundred miles (400) from Montreal and within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, of the district of Roberval;\nLe d\u00e9biteur a conclu au rejet de la p\u00e9tition ou, comme alternative, \u00e0 son renvoi devant le tribunal comp\u00e9tent.\nComme on le voit, l\u2019objection de l\u2019appelant fut que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le tribunal qu\u2019il convenait de saisir en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et qu\u2019il ne pouvait \u00eatre contraint d\u2019y compara\u00eetre pour se d\u00e9fendre.\n(a) Leave to appeal granted by this court ([1927] S.C.R. 275). La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi (sauf M. le juge Tellier) se sont prononc\u00e9s contre cette objection. Elle est maintenant soumise \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame, par autorisation sp\u00e9ciale[2], \u00e0 cause de la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la question qu\u2019elle soul\u00e8ve.\nNous croyons que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 pour les raisons suivantes:\nUne p\u00e9tition de faillite doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la cour ayant juridiction dans la localit\u00e9 du d\u00e9biteur (Loi de faillite, art. 4, parag. 4, sous-parag. b).\nLa \u201clocalit\u00e9 d\u2019un d\u00e9biteur\u201d est d\u00e9finie par la loi (art. 2, parag, x):\n(a) le lieu principal o\u00f9 le d\u00e9biteur a exerc\u00e9 un commerce pendant l\u2019ann\u00e9e qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de imm\u00e9diatement la date de la pr\u00e9sentation contre lui d\u2019une p\u00e9tition en faillite ou de la cession autoris\u00e9e faite par lui; ou (b) l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 le d\u00e9biteur a \u00e9t\u00e9 domicili\u00e9 pendant l\u2019ann\u00e9e qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de imm\u00e9diatement la date de la pr\u00e9sentation contre lui d\u2019une p\u00e9tition en faillite ou de la cession autoris\u00e9e faite par lui; ou (c) dans les cas qui ne tombent pas sous (a) ou (b), le lieu o\u00f9 la plus grande partie des biens de ce d\u00e9biteur est situ\u00e9e; (1923, art. 2 (3)).\nLa cour qui a juridiction \u201cen droit et en \u00e9quit\u00e9\u201d et qui peut\nexercer la juridiction originale, auxiliaire et subordonn\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re de faillite et en d\u2019autres proc\u00e9dures autoris\u00e9es\npar la loi de faillite est, \u201cdans la province de Qu\u00e9bec,\u201d \u201cla Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de la province\u201d (Loi de faillite, art. 63, parag. 1, sous-parag. d).\nPour les fins de l\u2019administration de la justice, la province est divis\u00e9e en vingt-cinq districts judiciaires et la Loi de la division territoriale (S.R.Q.. 1925, c. 2) d\u00e9crit le territoire compris dans chacun de ces districts. Les juges de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure exercent leurs fonctions dans les districts \u201cqui leur sont de temps en temps assign\u00e9s\u201d (S.R.Q., 1925, c. 145, art. 22). Depuis le 1er janvier 1921, sauf quant aux districts de Saint-Fran\u00e7ois et des Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, les juges ne sont plus charg\u00e9s de l\u2019administration de la justice dans un district en particulier. Ils doivent, \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le, remplir leurs fonctions dans chacun des districts de la province, suivant les ordres du juge-en-chef (S.R.Q., 1925, c. 145, art. 27). Cette obligation n\u2019existe pas pour les juges nomm\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieurement au 26 juillet 1920, qui \u00e9taient jusqu\u2019alors charg\u00e9s des districts de Qu\u00e9bec, Montr\u00e9al, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res et Saint-Fran\u00e7ois. Mais, sans y \u00eatre oblig\u00e9s, ces juges ont le droit d\u2019exercer leurs pouvoirs dans les autres districts; et il est indiscutable que chacun des juges de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure (m\u00eame de ceux qui sont charg\u00e9s des districts de Saint-Fran\u00e7ois et des Trois-Rivi\u00e8res) a juridiction pour administrer la justice dans chacun des vingt-cinq districts judiciaires. La juridiction de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure est g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et embrasse toute la province (S.R.Q., 1925, c. 145, art. 2).\nA priori, la r\u00e9sidence fix\u00e9e dans la commission du juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure est donc indiff\u00e9rente \u00e0 la question de sa comp\u00e9tence. Ce qui importe, c\u2019est le lieu o\u00f9 il se trouve au moment de l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions. Il suffit que le juge, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, soit \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 doivent \u00eatre tenues les s\u00e9ances de la cour (R.S.Q., arts. 44 et 49.\u2014Comparer avec la loi 11 Geo. V., c. 101, art. 1) dans le district o\u00f9 l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement introduite.\nLa loi qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, maintenant consign\u00e9e dans la Loi des tribunaux judiciaires (S.R.Q., 1925,\u2014 c. 145, art. 2), ne d\u00e9finit nulle part la juridiction de cette cour ratione materi\u0153 ou ratione person\u0153. Elle se contente d\u2019\u00e9tablir le tribunal et de l\u2019organiser. Elle laisse aux l\u00e9gislatures comp\u00e9tentes le soin de lui attribuer les affaires dont elle pourra \u00eatre saisie r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et, suivant l\u2019expression de Japiot (Proc\u00e9dure civile et commerciale, n\u00b0 31), de fixer le lien que la personne du d\u00e9fendeur \u00e9tablit entre l\u2019affaire et un point du territoire.\nPour la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et les droits civils, qui sont de son ressort, la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec y a pourvu au moyen du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile. C\u2019est l\u00e0 que l\u2019appelant a trouv\u00e9 les dispositions et les r\u00e8gles qu\u2019il demande \u00e0 la cour d\u2019appliquer \u00e0 sa cause. Le pouvoir et la juridiction, en mati\u00e8re civile, de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et de ses juges y sont d\u00e9finis dans des articles sp\u00e9ciaux (arts. 40, 48 et suiv., 70 et suivants C.P.C.). Les r\u00e8gles concernant le lieu de l\u2019introduction de l\u2019action y sont \u00e9galement d\u00e9termin\u00e9es (94 et suiv. C.P.C.). Mais la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure ne se borne pas \u00e0 celle qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par le code de proc\u00e9dure. Elle lui vient, en outre, de plusieurs autres lois provinciales. Elle lui vient aussi d\u2019un certain nombre de lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales.\nLe Parlement du Canada, en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 cette cour une mati\u00e8re qui est de son domaine, est libre en m\u00eame temps de prescrire la proc\u00e9dure qui sera suivie et le territoire sur lequel sa juridiction sera exerc\u00e9e. (Cushing v. Dupuy[3]). Il peut bien, comme il l\u2019a fait, par exemple, pour la Loi des \u00e9lections f\u00e9d\u00e9rales contest\u00e9es (S.R.C., c. 7, art. 3), adopter la division territoriale qui pr\u00e9vaut dans le code de proc\u00e9dure. Mais il lui est loisible d\u2019en indiquer une autre; et c\u2019est ce qu\u2019il a fait dans la Loi de faillite. Pour les fins de cette loi, chaque province du Canada constitue un district (art. 64, parag. 5) et, dans chaque province, la cour \u00e0 laquelle les affaires de faillite sont attribu\u00e9es a juridiction sur toute la province, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 la d\u00e9limitation des districts judiciaires. Le Parlement a autoris\u00e9 le Gouverneur en conseil \u00e0 diviser chaque province (district de faillite) en deux ou plusieurs divisions de faillite, \u00e0 les nommer et \u00e0 les num\u00e9roter. Mais cela n\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, except\u00e9 pour l\u2019administration de la loi par les s\u00e9questres officiels. Et encore, cette division restreinte \u00e9tablie par l\u2019arr\u00eat\u00e9-en-conseil publi\u00e9 le 1er septembre 1923, ne suit pas les lignes de d\u00e9marcation des districts judiciaires tels qu\u2019ils existent dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. L\u2019annexe D, qui concerne le \u201cdistrict de faillite de Qu\u00e9bec\u201d, inclut dans une seule division nomm\u00e9e \u201cMontr\u00e9al\u201d, tout le territoire compris dans les comt\u00e9s ou districts de Montr\u00e9al, Iberville, Richelieu, Saint-Hyacinthe, Terrebonne et Beauharnois. Un groupement semblable est fait pour la division de Qu\u00e9bec, etc.\nSous la Loi de faillite, la d\u00e9limitation en districts judiciaires tels qu\u2019ils sont compris dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, n\u2019est donc pas reconnue. Cette loi ne m\u00e9conna\u00eet pas le principe du droit romain: Actor sequitur forum rei. Elle en fait une application plus large. Le forum rei n\u2019est plus seulement le district judiciaire provincial, c\u2019est toute la province. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui concerne tout le pays, et elle envisage le territoire \u00e0 ce point de vue. En outre, c\u2019est une loi de faillite et elle se pr\u00e9occupe davantage de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des cr\u00e9anciers que de celui du failli. (In re J. F. Camirand Limited[4]). Elle offre d\u2019ailleurs toutes les facilit\u00e9s pour que les audiences soient tenues aux \u00e9poques et aux lieux que la cour jugera \u00e0 propos (arts. 64, parag. 2; 71, parag. 3; r\u00e8gle n\u00b0 63).\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la p\u00e9tition de faillite contre l\u2019appelant pouvait donc \u00eatre produite \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, qui est un des endroits \u201cfix\u00e9s par l\u2019autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente\u201d pour la tenue des termes et s\u00e9ances de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure (S.R.Q., 1925, c. 145, art. 49) et qui se trouve dans le district de faillite (i.e. la province de Qu\u00e9bec), o\u00f9 est situ\u00e9e la \u201clocalit\u00e9 du d\u00e9biteur\u201d. La p\u00e9tition a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des s\u00e9ances, \u00e0 un juge qui, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, si\u00e9geait \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, et \u00e0 qui elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9e par le juge exer\u00e7ant les fonctions de juge-en-chef de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.

C.R. 28, dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action for infringement of patent, was affirmed, on the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s patent (for an appliance for carrying, in a paper manufacturing machine, the paper from the drying rolls to and through the calenders) was invalid, because the device, however useful, did not involve invention; the patentee\u2019s claim rested on a combination, all the elements of which, and the very purpose for which it was designed, were old and well-known in the art; there was no room for novelty, except possibly in certain features which were not of a nature to justify the patentee\u2019s claim. APPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, dismissing its actions against the respective defendants for infringement of patent[1], the judgment resting on the ground of invalidity of the patent. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and R. S. Smart K.C. for the appellant.\nA. W. Anglin K.C. and J. G. Gibson for the respondent The Spanish River Pulp and Paper Mills, Limited.\nChristopher C. Robinson K.C. and L. A. Landriau for the respondent Abitibi Power and Paper Company, Limited.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014These two appeals were argued together. They relate to the same controversy.\nThe appellant is the assignee of Charles E. Pope, now deceased, and as such is the owner of Canadian patents, nos. 186,500 and 192,726, \u201cfor improvements in method and machine for making paper,\u201d granted to Pope on the 10th of September, 1918, and the 16th of September, 1919, respectively. It brought two actions for infringement, one against the Spanish River Pulp and Paper Mills, Limited, hereinafter termed the Spanish River Company, and the other against the Abitibi Power and Paper Company, Limited, which I will call the Abitibi Company. In the action against the Spanish River Company it was alleged that that company had infringed both patents, and at the trial the defendant admitted infringement of patent no. 186,500, so that the action succeeded with respect to that patent, but went on to trial as to patent no. 192,726. The action against the Abitibi Company alleged infringement merely of patent no. 192,726, which accordingly is the only patent of which the validity is now in question.\nThe action against the Spanish River Company was tried first and, by consent, the evidence adduced was made applicable to the action against the Abitibi Company, the trial of which immediately followed, some additional evidence having been introduced. In both cases the actions were dismissed by the Exchequer Court, on the ground that patent no. 192,726 was invalid. The appellant now appeals in each case.\nThe patent is for an appliance for carrying, in a paper manufacturing machine, the paper from the drying rolls to and through the calenders. The modern paper machine presents this feature that a solution of pulp and water is introduced at one end, and at the other end, some 200 feet away, the fully manufactured paper emerges and winds itself upon rolls. This involves first the gradual removal of the water, the pressing and drying of the residuum of pulp, and finally what is called the calendering of the paper, which is done by passing it through several heavy steel rolls in order to give it a proper gloss or smoothness of surface.\nThe patented device deals with the dried paper as it passes from the drying rolls onto and through the calender rolls. These calender rolls, eight or ten in number, are in a vertical stack; the motive power is applied to the lowermost and much the largest roll, and each of the other rolls revolves by friction with the roll below it, each turning in an opposite direction from the one immediately above and below. The paper web, which may be, and frequently is, twenty feet in width, enters the stack of calender rolls at the top, or between the two uppermost rolls, and moves in the same direction as the lower roll, that is to say it winds around each successive lower roll, thus changing its direction from side to side at each roll, and it emerges at th\u00e9 bottom in a fully manufactured state.\nThe patented device is intended to facilitate the passage of the paper through the stack of calender rolls. It is stated to consist in a combination between the calenders of a paper machine, an appliance called the \u201cdoctor\u201d arranged to strip the paper from an upper calender roll, and an air passage designed to direct a current of air against the upper calender roll beneath the point of contact of the \u201cdoctor\u201d therewith, so as to impinge on such roll and be directed against the paper passing between the upper and lower calender roll, and press the paper against the latter roll. In explanation of this description, we are told that the paper web has a tendency to continue revolving around the same roll after it has passed through the nip or bite between the two rolls. To prevent this, there is first the \u201cdoctor,\u201d which consists in a sharp knife on a rigid frame extending the whole width of the paper web. The shape of the \u201cdoctor\u201d varies, but in the drawings of the patent in suit it is shewn as having two arms at right angles, one horizontal containing the scraping knife and the other vertical extending downwards. The \u201cdoctor\u201d can at will be brought into contact with the roll or removed some distance therefrom. When it is in the former position, as far as one can judge from the drawings, the knife scrapes the upper roll at about 10 or 15 degrees beyond the nip or bite, and thus the paper is prevented from revolving around the upper roll. In addition there is in the vertical arm of the \u201cdoctor\u201d a pipe through which a stream of compressed air is directed against the upper roll just below its point of contact with the knife, and this stream of air, after reaching the upper roll, deflects downwards towards the lower roll, thus pressing against the paper and forcing it to revolve around the lower roll. This operation is repeated at each roll until the paper emerges from the nip between the two lower rolls and the calendering process is complete.\nWhen a web of paper is to be started through the calender rolls, the practice is to cut off a portion of the paper from the web, thus leaving, at the inside edge of the paper machine, a strip of about six inches wide, called the lead strip, and when this strip has successfully passed through the rolls it is gradually widened until the whole width of the paper web goes through the calender rolls. It is stated that in the modern paper machine the paper passes through these rolls at a speed of from 600 to 1,000 feet per minute. What the specifications chiefly emphasize is that, before the alleged invention, the operation whereby the lead strip was made to go through the calender rolls was attended with great danger to the operatives, inasmuch as they had to direct this strip by hand, so as to cause it to engage the nip or bite between the two rolls, with the result that not infrequently their fingers were caught and crushed. With this appliance there is stated to be a saving of manual labour as well as the prevention of injury to the men. I think its utility can be granted, and this apparently was the opinion of the learned President of the Exchequer Court, who, however, did not regard that as conclusive of the validity of the patent. The crucial question is whether this device, however useful, involves invention. This brings me to the appellant\u2019s actions and to the defences set up by the respondents.\nBoth actions were based on infringement by the defendants, with the usual demand for damages, an injunction, an account of profits, etc.\nThe principal defences of the respondents may be briefly summarized. They were:\n1. That the patent in suit had not been infringed;\n2. That it was void for lack of novelty and invention;\n3. That the patent was void because the alleged invention had been in public use or on sale with the consent or by allowance of the alleged inventor for more than one year previous to the application for a patent in Canada;\n4. That at all events the respondents were protected, as to their use of the device, by subs. 2 of s. 7 of the Patent Act of 1921 (11-12 Geo. V, c. 44).\nThe learned trial judge did not give effect to the last two defences. He dealt at considerable length with the second defence. Generally agreeing with the contention that, in view of the state of the prior art, the patent in suit lacked invention, he rested his judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action on the ground that all that Pope had done was to apply a well known thing to an analogous use, and that there was no invention in the mode of application.\nIt must be remembered that the plaintiff\u2019s patent does not claim to have invented a new principle for directing the paper web, or the lead strip to which its width has been reduced, towards the lower roll. The evidence shews, and it is not disputed, that the appliance called the \u201cdoctor,\u201d of which there are two standard forms, was well known, and it is employed by Pope for the very purpose for which it was designed. The use of a stream of compressed air for pressing the paper against the lower roll was also familiar in the prior art. It is true that different appliances were devised and patented for directing this stream of air towards the paper, so as to press it against the lower roll, these appliances sometimes taking the shape of a windshield surrounding a part of the lower roll, with perforated holes on the inside surface through which the current of air was forced against the paper, sometimes of cylindrical pipes, also with perforated holes for the same purpose; but although there was a difference in the shape of these appliances, the function they were designed to perform was identically the same as in the patent in suit. Moreover, Pope himself had patented, in 1915, a device, not dissimilar to that in question, which dealt in a like manner with the wet web as it passed through the press rolls, by delivering a thin sheet of air substantially tangential to the cylindrical surface of the press roll, so as to take off the web from the press roll in\u2019 case it should have a tendency to adhere thereto. It does not appear to have required invention to adopt a similar method for directing the dry paper through the calendar rolls, which is a use analogous to that mentioned in the Pope patent of 1915.\nNothing more is claimed here than a combination between a \u201cdoctor,\u201d which was old, the calenders of a paper machine, also old, and an air passage to direct air against the surface of the upper calender, below its point of contact with the \u201c doctor.\u201d All this was well known in the art, noticeably the use of a stream of compressed air to force the paper downwards along the revolving surface of the lower roll until it reached the nip or bite, when the same process was repeated. There was no room for novelty except perhaps in the shape of the appliance, or possibly in the precise point towards which the stream of air was directed. Such features, however, cannot justify the claim of the patentee, who did not seek a patent for an improvement of an existing device, but rested on a combination, all the elements of which, and the very purpose for which it was designed, were old and well known in the art. I have very carefully read the testimony and considered the patents put in evidence, and I do not think the patent in suit can be supported. The learned trial judge has so fully discussed the issues and the evidence that I feel I cannot usefully add anything further to what he has said. The existence or not of invention involves merely a question of fact, and on this question of fact I think the appeal fails. It is not necessary to express any opinion as to the other defences of the respondents.\nI would dismiss both appeals with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Russel S. Smart.\nSolicitors for the respondent The Spanish River Pulp and Paper Mills, Limited: Gibson & Gibson.\nSolicitors for the respondent Abitibi Power and Paper Company, Limited: Kilmer, Irving & Davis.\n[1] [1927] Ex.

The consideration of the transfer was expressed to be natural love and affection and $1. T. and his wife continued to occupy and work the farm as formerly. Plaintiff recovered a judgment against T., and under execution issued thereon the sheriff seized certain grain which had been grown on the farm since T.\u2019s wife became the registered owner and which grain had been shipped in her name. T.\u2019s wife claimed the grain.\nHeld (reversing in part judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, 36 Man. R. 135, and restoring in part judgment of Macdonald J., ibid; Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault J. dissenting): The trial judge\u2019s finding that the transfer was made to defraud TVs creditors should be affirmed; (held, that the evidence presented as to this was open to consideration, having regard to the form of the issue and the course of the trial); therefore (subject to the effect of the Executions Act, Man.) the transfer was void as against them, and as against the sheriff representing them, even though as between T. and his wife, it may have been intended to operate irrevocably as an absolute gift, and, the conveyance being voluntary, it made no difference whether it was a sham or not; hence the creditors could look to T. as having the equitable and beneficial title to the farm, to which the possession and right to the crops were incident (applying the rule derived from the Roman Law, by which, at least as against a purchaser other than a bona fide possessor, the owner of the principal thing becomes the owner also of the fruits; and not adopting the law as stated in certain cases resting upon Kilbride v. Cameron, 17 U.C.C.P., 373, which case is discussed). T.\u2019s wife could not justify her claim upon the evidence that she directed the farming operations and contributed to the necessary labour in which T. was also engaged. The grain was, therefore, liable to seizure under plaintiff\u2019s execution, but subject to the Executions Act, R.S.M. 1913, c. 66. The effect of that Act was to exempt from such seizure the grain grown on 160 acres of the farm. The grain seized was the product of 150 acres of wheat and 100 acres of rye, and, having regard to the choice allowed the judgment debtor under the Act (which choice the claimant might justly exercise) the exempted grain should be fixed as comprising all the wheat (the more valuable grain) and 1\/10 part of the rye. Costs of the interpleader order to go to plaintiff; all other costs in all courts to be apportioned pro rata according to the value of the grain as to which the parties respectively succeed (Dixon v. Yates, 5 B. & Ad. 347, and other cases, referred to).\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault J. (dissenting): The wife, after the transfer to her, actually carried on the farming operations on her own account and without her husband having any \u201cproprietary interest\u201d therein or control thereof. The grain was \u201cproperty acquired\u201d by her in an \u201coccupation in which she is engaged or which she carries on separately from her husband, and in which her husband has no proprietary interest\u201d within s. 2 (b) of the Married Women\u2019s Property Act, R.S.M. 1913, c. 123. As to the bona fides of her claim in that respect, evidence of the circumstances under which she acquired the farm was admissible. But, once it is found that she so carried on the farming operations, the facts that the transfer of the farm to her was fraudulent and void as against her husband\u2019s creditors (if a finding to that effect was justified) and that the husband resided on the farm and aided in the farming, did not prevent her from claiming the crops grown as her own to the exclusion of his creditors (Kilbride v. Cameron, 17 U.C.C.P. 373, and Standard Trusts Co. v. Briggs, [1926] 1 W.W.R. 832, approved on this point). S. 14 of the Married Women\u2019s Property Act had no bearing on the question in issue.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff (by leave of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba) from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] which, by a majority, reversing the judgment of Macdonald J.[2], held that the grain referred to in the interpleader order herein, was, at the time of the seizure thereof by the sheriff, the property of the claimant as against the plaintiff, and was not liable to seizure under the writ of execution issued on behalf of the plaintiff against the defendant Ignace Tencha, husband of the claimant. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported.\nN. A. Belcourt K.C. for the appellant.\nH. A. Bergman K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The appellant, formerly known as the Banque d\u2019Hochelaga, obtained judgment in the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Manitoba against the defendant, Ignace Tencha, on 25th July, 1924, for $1,643.34 debt, and $51.80 costs, upon a promissory note which had been given to the bank by the defendant, John Tencha, and guaranteed by the defendants, Joseph Tencha and Ignace Tencha. The liability was originally contracted by these parties by a promissory note of 7th August, 1922, which in the interval had been renewed from time to time. Execution was issued upon this judgment on 22nd August, 1924, and was subsequently renewed for two years from 19th August, 1926. The writ was delivered to the sheriff of the Eastern Judicial District of Manitoba, who was directed to levy the amount. The bank, at the same time, held other judgments amounting to a considerable sum against Ignace Tencha. He was a farmer residing, with his wife, Irene Tencha, the claimant, and adopted children, on a farm in Manitoba known in the case as the Johnston farm, consisting of the west half of section 19, township 8, range 3, East, which they had occupied and worked since January, 1918, when it was bought by the husband from Hugh Johnston, who appears to have been the registered owner of the farm, subject to a mortgage to the Great West Life Assurance Company for the principal sum of $6,500. Johnston says he sold the farm to Ignace Tencha for $15,000] and received a cash payment on account of $1,600. It is said also that the sale included some stock and farming machinery or implements; the agreement was in writing but the writing is not produced. It appears, however, as will be shown, that Johnston, while he retained the legal title, received the crops of grain which were grown upon the land, and that the proceeds, in considerable part at least, went in reduction of the purchase price, of which the amount due upon the mortgage formed part.\nOn 15th November, 1922, Ignace Tencha, the judgment debtor, gave a deed to his wife whereby he granted, released and quitted claim to her all his \u201cestate, right, title, interest, claim and demand whatsoever both in law and in equity\u201d in the Johnston farm for the expressed consideration of natural love and affection and the sum of $1. At the same time, and for the like consideration he gave her a bill of sale of all his stock and farming implements. The learned trial judge found that \u201cat this time the husband was heavily involved financially to the knowledge of his wife, and, by the giving away of his lands and chattels, he was stripped of every possible available means or power of satisfying his creditors\u201d; and that the transfers were executed \u201cfor the purpose of defrauding creditors of the husband by preventing the recovery of their claims against him.\u201d\nMrs. Tencha, having thus acquired her husband\u2019s interest in the farm, concluded an arrangement with Johnston, who had the legal title, whereby he transferred his title to her in consideration of the assignment of a mortgage of $900, which she had upon the property of one Sawchuk, and it is said that she agreed to assume the Great West Mortgage, upon which the principal still remained unpaid. The registered title to the Johnston farm is proved by the deputy district registrar, and it appears by his evidence that Johnston transferred to Mrs. Tencha on 22nd April, 1924, subject to the mortgage, and that there is a certificate of title outstanding in her name.\nAfter the transfer by the husband to his wife, they continued to reside on the farm and to work it as formerly, she doing a man\u2019s work on the place, as she had been accustomed to do. There is evidence that she was the better manager, and that she planned the farming operations. The husband was not called.\nOn 18th November, 1925, grain grown during that season upon the Johnston farm was shipped in three cars in the name of Mrs. Tencha from Cartier Siding in Manitoba, consigned to the Manitoba Wheat Pool, an institution of which Mrs. Tencha seems to have been a member. In one of these cars, no. 321371, there were 1,052.30 bushels of damp rejected 2 C.W. Amber Durum Wheat; in another, no. 310797, 1,145.50 bushels tough rejected 3 C.W. Amber Durum Wheat, while the third car, no. 406159, contained 632.52 bushels net brake and damp rejected Rye. It was upon this grain that the Sheriff proposed to levy the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s execution against the judgment debtor, Ignace Tencha, the plaintiff claiming that the grain was liable to answer the judgment debt notwithstanding the transfers to Mrs. Tencha and her certificate of title; Mrs. Tencha, however, claimed the property as her own, and the sheriff, on 5th December, 1925, obtained an interpleader order directing that the plaintiff and the claimant should proceed to trial of an issue in the Court of King\u2019s Bench at Winnipeg wherein the bank should be plaintiff, and that the question to be tried should be whether the grain shipped\nfrom Cartier Siding in Manitoba on or about the 18th day of November, 1925, in railway cars Nos. C.N 321371 and C.N. 310797, consigned to The Manitoba Wheat Pool, and that part of the grain in car No. 406159, claimed by the above named Irene Tencha, is liable to seizure under the writ of Fieri Facias herein as against the claim of the said Irene Tencha.\nThis issue was accordingly tried, and the trial judge found for the plaintiff, but his judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal, two of the learned justices dissenting.\nThere was considerable discussion in both courts about the Married Women\u2019s Property Act, and there is in the respondent\u2019s factum an elaborate review of the provincial decisions interpreting the various acts, although it is not denied on either side that the legislation confers upon the wife adequate capacity to acquire and hold the property; Married Women\u2019s Property Act, R.S.M., 1913, ch. 123, ss. 3 et seq. It is however expressly declared by s. 14 that:.\nnothing in this Act contained shall give validity as against creditors of the husband to any gift by a husband to his wife, of any property, in fraud of his creditors,\nand, that being so, I apprehend that while Mrs. Tencha acquired title to the land conveyed by her husband and by Johnston, as to which she subsequently obtained a certificate of title, that title, notwithstanding anything in the Married Women\u2019s Property Act, remained subject to the infirmity by which it was affected by reason of the statute, 13 Elizabeth, c. 5. Section 79 of the Real Property Act, R.S.M. 1913, c. 171, which provides that a certificate of title, while in force, shall be conclusive evidence in law and in equity that the person named is entitled to the land described therein for the estate or interest therein mentioned, is also expressed to be subject to the right of any person\nto show fraud wherein the registered owner, mortgagee or encumberancer (sic) has participated or colluded and as against such registered owner, mortgagee or encumbrancee; but the onus of proving * * * such fraud shall be upon the person alleging the same.\nIt follows from these enactments and from their interpretation as affirmed in the judgment of this court in Fraser v. Douglas[3], that, in the absence of fraud, the conveyance by Ignace Tencha to his wife would have been effective as against his creditors. I shall assume, then, that if the conveyance had not been fraudulent, the wife would have had a vindicable right to the crops; and therefore, if this action is to succeed, it must be because it is established that, as against the husband\u2019s creditors, the conveyance of the farm by the husband to the wife was fraudulent, and that the husband, as the owner of the land, was also the owner of the grain as to which the right of seizure is now in question.\nI have read the evidence and judgments very attentively, and I entertain no doubt in the result that the findings of the learned trial judge upon the facts should be allowed to stand, except in so far as they are affected by the Executions Act, to which I shall presently refer. It would, of course, have been more satisfactory if the written agreement between Johnston and Ignace Tencha had been produced, or if there had been acceptable proof of its contents, particularly with relation to the crops, because it seems that, although after the agreement the crops were raised by the Tenchas, they were shipped by Johnston, who received them and their proceeds, and made the payments which were made thereout. Johnston, who was called for the claimant, in direct examination says:\nMr. Bowles: Q. How were their payments made during the first four years. Did they make them promptly?\nA. Yes. We just shipped the grain, and I looked after the grain for them. Mrs. Tencha doesn\u2019t know very much English, and she shipped the grain, and it went to the Station.\nQ. There was a mortgage to the Great West Life?\nA. Yes. They assumed it, and I paid it.\nHis Lordship: Who did you sell to?\nA. To the Tenchas, Irene and Ignace.\nQ. Was your agreement with both of them?\nA. No. It was drawn in Ignace Tencha\u2019s name\u2014I am not sure.\nMr. Bowles: Q. You made the payments to the Great West Life on that mortgage?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And you handled the grain yourself, you say?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Was there any dissatisfaction on the part of the Great West Life Assurance Company, about the money that they were getting?\nA. No, except they complained one year because they didn\u2019t get the money, because we were holding the grain to try and get the higher price in the spring, which Mrs. Tencha thought we should do.\n* * * * * *\nMr. Bowles: It is an agreement in writing between yourself and Ignace Tencha?\nA. Yes.\nQ. It provided for the payment\u2014the instalments?\nA. Yes, it does.\nQ. Have you a copy of that agreement?\nA. No. I didn\u2019t bring it here, no.\nQ. You haven\u2019t got it with you now?\nA. No, I didn\u2019t bring it here, of course.\nAnd further in cross-examination:\nHis Lordship: You sold the property for $15,000?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And you got $1,500 in cash?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And you got this $850 mortgage?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And they assumed the mortgage for about $7,000?\nA. $6,500 I think it was.\nQ. You had about $6,000 coming to you?\nA. I had. I was getting a share of the grain during this time, and I applied that on my agreement, of course. Mr. Bergman: Did you get any payments from Ignace Tencha direct, on your agreement, apart from the cash payment?\nA. No.\nQ. All the rest of the payments that you got on the agreement until Mrs, Tencha took it over, were, what you realized by taking possession of the crop each year?\nA. Yes.\nIgnace Tencha, as I have said, gave no evidence. He was not called by either side. Mrs. Tencha, in her examination for discovery, speaking of the Johnston farm and the period before she received the conveyance from her husband, had said:\nQ. And he was putting in the seed?\nA. Yes.\nQ. That time he was looking after it himself?\nA. Yes, he was boss.\nQ. He was boss at that time?\nA. Yes.\nQ. He got the money from the crop?\nA. When?\nQ. He got the money from the crop that time?\nA. Yes.\nQ. He sold the wheat?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And got the money?\nA. Yes.\nAnd, when called at the trial on her own behalf, she said:\nQ. Did you have any conversations with him about the buying of the land, that is, with Mr. Johnston, I mean?\nA. Yes, I had.\nQ. What conversations did you have? What was said?\nA. After my husband bought the land I told Mr. Johnston to sell the crop and take the money.\nThis evidence suggests that the annual crops may have been the subject of some stipulation in the agreement of sale, and that Johnston evidently had an interest in them. It is, of course, a necessary part of the plaintiff\u2019s case to show that they belonged to Ignace Tencha under a title which could be upheld in competition with that of Mrs. Tencha, who succeeded to Johnston\u2019s rights under his agreement of sale when he conveyed the property to her in 1924; but that burden was prima facie satisfied by the proof of Tencha\u2019s title and possession upon which the plaintiff relied, and when the transfer from Tencha to his wife, under which she claimed the crops, was shown to be void against the plaintiff, and when she introduced the evidence which I have quoted, if the purpose were to show that she had derived title to the crops as the assignee of Johnston, I think it was incumbent upon the claimant to prove the Johnston agreement; it was in her possession, or in that of Johnston under whom she claimed, and she was therefore in a position to produce it, and no doubt would have done so if its provisions had been favourable to her claim. Therefore I think it must be taken that, as between Johnston or his assignee and Ignace Tencha, the crops belonged to the latter.\nThen, if the transfer by Ignace Tencha to his wife were, as is found, fraudulent and void against his creditors, has Mrs. Tencha nevertheless a right to the grain subsequently grown upon the land? The Court of Appeal answers this question in the affirmative, relying upon the cases of Kilbride v. Cameron[4], and others to which I shall refer. Kilbride v. Cameron4 was heard before two judges of the Court of Common Pleas of Ontario, Adam Wilson J. and John Wilson J., on appeal from Richards C.J., the Chief Justice of that court. It was an interpleader issue to try whether the crops mentioned below were the property of the claimant as against the defendant, who was an execution creditor of John Kilbride, the claimant\u2019s father. There were twenty-four acres of hay in stack, also sixteen acres of wheat and four acres of peas growing upon a lot which John Kilbride, the former owner, had conveyed to one of his sons, either Thomas or another who conveyed it to Thomas, who devised it to his brother Patrick, who conveyed it to the claimant. Patrick had got the land subject to a mortgage; the maintenance of his father and mother; a small annuity to them during their lives, and other charges, and he had conveyed to the claimant subject to these. The consideration of the deed from John Kilbride was that his son should pay him $500, and also pay his debts. It was contended at the trial that all these conveyances and transactions were fraudulent and voluntary and not intended to pass the land in fact, but the Chief Justice was of opinion upon the evidence that there was an intention to pass the property in the land, and that there was no evidence upon which the jury could be satisfied that the intention was otherwise. He was also of the opinion that even if the conveyances were fraudulent, still the grain and crops raised upon the land by the plaintiff or his brothers by their labour and at their expense could not be taken in execution to satisfy the father\u2019s debts and he directed a verdict for the plaintiff. Upon motion for a new trial, A. Wilson, J., considered that, even if the transactions relating to the land were not valid as to the creditors of the father, that would not determine the right of property to the crops in question, because it was shown that the father did not raise the crops nor furnish the means for doing so, and that the labour and means were contributed by the sons alone. He thought that, assuming the deed to be fraudulent, the sheriff\u2019s right to seize the crops depended upon whether John Kilbride, the judgment debtor, had contributed to the expense of raising them. He proceeded to say, moreover, that the burdens imposed by the devisor upon the devisee, and which the devisee assumed to discharge, constituted an actual and valuable consideration which would support the prior fraudulent deed, unless both devisor and devisee could be charged with notice of the fraudulent object, and he concluded upon the evidence that the crops were the sole property of the plaintiff as against the execution creditor. J. Wilson J., on the other hand, considered that the evidence rather pointed to the fact that the conveyances were colourable, and that the crops therefore belonged to the father, and he thought there should be a new trial. The report adds that Richards, C.J., expressed an opinion in favour of the view of A. Wilson J., but took no part in the judgment, as he had not been present at the argument, and that, the court therefore being equally divided, the rule could not be discharged, and the verdict consequently stood. There is thus nothing conclusive about this case, even for the court by which it was decided. In Johnston Lumber Co. v. Hager (1)[5], Clarke J.A., delivering his judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, quotes with approval the judgment of J. Wilson J., in Kilbride v. Cameron[6]; and, in Standard Trust Co. v. Briggs[7], Harvey C.J., of the same court, refers to these cases as showing that, if the conveyance of the land were fraudulent, the crops raised for the transferee do not belong to the transferor. Newlands, J., expressed the same view, citing Kilbride v. Cameron[8], in Massey-Harris v. Moore[9], and in Cotton v. Boyd[10]. Thus all these cases, for which no other authority is cited, rest upon Kilbride v. Cameron8, a very indecisive case, the reasoning of which, moreover, depends upon facts the opposite of those now in proof. I prefer to apply the rule derived from the Roman Law, by which, at least as against a purchaser other than a bona fide possessor, the owner of the principal thing becomes the owner also of the fruits. Here there was no case of bona fide possession, because it was at the instance and by the contrivance of Mrs. Tencha that she received the voluntary conveyance, and, as to the possession in fact, husband and wife continued thereafter to occupy and work the premises as they had done before. It is laid down in Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, Vol. II, p. 404, that\nThe doctrine of property arising from accession is also grounded on the right of occupancy. By the Roman Law, it any given corporeal substance received afterwards an accession by natural or by artificial means, as by the growth of vegetables, the pregnancy of animals, the embroidering of cloth, or the conversion of wood or metal into vessels and utensils, the original owner of the thing was entitled by his right of possession to the property of it under such its state of improvement; but if the thing itself, by such operation, was changed into a different species as by making wine, oil, or bread, out of another\u2019s grapes, olives, or wheat, it belonged to the new operator; who was only to make a satisfaction to the former proprietor for the materials, which he had so converted. And these doctrines are implicitly copied and adopted by our Bracton, in the reign of King Henry III; and have since been confirmed by many resolutions of the courts.\nThis passage is reproduced with some enlargement in Stephen\u2019s Commentaries, 17th ed., Vol. II, p. 525, including the statement that even when the offspring or produce is separated from the principal corporeal object it still belongs to the owner of the latter. It must therefore follow, since the judgment debtor\u2019s conveyance of the land was void when brought into competition with the claims of his creditors, that it should, for the purpose of adjudicating their rights, be treated as frustrate and not existing, and then it comes to this\u2014that Tencha had the equitable or beneficial title, to which the possession and right to the crops was incident, while his wife, after she had obtained the legal title from Johnston, had the rights that the latter would have had if he had not conveyed to her. She cannot, I think, justify her claim upon the evidence that she directed the farming operations and contributed with her own hands to the necessary labour in which her husband was also engaged.\nIt is argued, and I think held by some of the judges of the Court of Appeal, that evidence should not have been admitted to prove that the transfer from Ignace Tencha to his wife was fraudulent, and the case of Donohoe v. Hull et al in this Court[11], is cited; but, looking to the form of the issue, which was settled by agreement between counsel, and having regard to the course of the trial, I think the case as presented must be considered, seeing that the character of the conveyance was regarded by the parties throughout as a question of fact upon which the right of seizure depended. Fullerton J.A., who delivered the dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal, states that:\nOn the trial, counsel for defendant objected to all evidence tendered with a view to showing that the transfer of the land from the husband to the wife was fraudulent against creditors.\nHe considers, however, for the reasons which he gives, that the evidence was relevant to the issue and therefore admissible. But I think that the learned judge was mistaken in supposing that such an objection was taken. I do not find it noted in the record; on the contrary, when the bank manager was being examined for the plaintiff at the very outset, and was asked to prove some promissory notes which had been given by Ignace Tencha, claimant\u2019s counsel said:\nI object to this on the grounds that it is in reference to some dealings between the bank and Ignace Tencha.\nThen, upon the discussion which followed, plaintiff\u2019s counsel having stated that he was attacking the transfer as fraudulent as against the creditors, there was no answer on the part of the claimant\u2019s counsel to that contention, and the judge intimated that he would allow the evidence. The trial proceeded without further reference to the point, and a great part of the testimony, and of the subsequent discussion in the case, is taken up with the question as to whether or not the transfer was fraudulent. It was held by Ritchie C.J. in Royal Insurance Company v. Duffus[12], following a similar ruling of Lord Denman in Rex v. Grant[13], that.\nWhen evidence is tendered the judge and opposing counsel are entitled to know the ground on which it is offered, and none can be urged on appeal that has not been put forward at the trial.\nThis ruling expresses a sound principle, well recognized in practice. If the conveyance be fraudulent the sheriff has the right and is compellable to seize, and the question of fraud is therefore one which enters into the very heart of the issue. It is no more immune from trial in interpleader proceedings than any other material fact.\nIt has always been common practice to determine, in an action against the sheriff for conversion or for a false return, the character and effect of a conveyance alleged to be fraudulent against creditors. It is not necessary to invoke the jurisdiction of the court to declare the conveyance void or to set it aside. In Baron Parke\u2019s well known judgment in Imray v. Magnay[14], he says:\nThe conclusion to which we have arrived is, that where there are goods seized under a former writ, founded on a judgment fraudulent against a creditor seeking to enforce a subsequent execution, and such goods remain in the hands of the sheriff, or are capable of being seized, the sheriff is compellable to seize and sell such goods under that subsequent execution; and this by virtue of the statute 13 Eliz. c. 5. (His Lordship read the second section of that statute). The judgment is by the statute made void against creditors, but by implication it is void against a sheriff, who acts in right of a creditor; as a deed is, which is fraudulent against creditors; Turvil v. Tipper[15]. And it is now of frequent occurrence that the sheriff is bound to take goods which have been fraudulently conveyed or assigned to defeat creditors, and is responsible in an action for a false return at the suit of a creditor; and the statute seems to us to put both on the same footing. The creditor has no other way of avoiding the judgment, than by enforcing his execution for his debt, notwithstanding an execution upon it; or by application to the equitable jurisdiction of the court to set it aside, which we apprehend has arisen in comparatively modern times; and whatever right the creditor had at the time of the statute he has now.\nThe issue under the Interpleader Rules is devised as a convenient means to enable the sheriff and the parties to have the question determined as to whether the sheriff is compellable to seize and sell the goods, and for the information of the court the issue is framed to include all questions which arise as to the title. There are no pleadings, and when the parties and the court understand, as they did in this case, that the object is to ascertain whether or not the conveyance upon which the claimant relies was fraudulent as against the creditors of the judgment debtor, the trial ought, I should think, to proceed upon that footing. In any event, it is, I think, too late to object upon appeal that there was a mistrial because the fraud was not pleaded.\nIt is suggested, if not held by the Court of Appeal, that the transfer cannot be attacked by the sheriff if it be intended to operate between the parties\u2014that it must be shown to be a mere sham or device for keeping off the sheriff. But it is, I think, certain, and it is unnecessary to quote cases for the proposition, that a deed, like that of Ignace Tencha to the claimant, made without valuable consideration and with the intention of defeating the grantor\u2019s creditors, is void as against them, and as against the sheriff representing them, although, as between grantor and grantee, it be intended to operate irrevocably as an absolute gift. Transfers of that nature are not to be confounded with those which were intended to prefer one or more of the grantor\u2019s creditors, or to avoid an execution by granting such a preference. Although the debtor\u2019s right of preference has been abrogated or modified by the Bankruptcy Acts or other statutes, it was admissible by Common Law, and was not affected by the Statute of Elizabeth, and a conveyance creating preferences was therefore formerly good, subject however to be avoided if it were shown to be a mere sham or pretext to keep off an execution and to enable the debtor to have the property back again; that, in a proper case, was a question for the jury, but it does not arise in a case like the present, which involves no question of preference, and where the purpose is to put the property out of reach of the creditors. Such a conveyance does not operate against them, sham or not. Twyne\u2019s case[16]; Riches v. Evans[17]. There is, however, difficulty in the plaintiff\u2019s way arising out of a point which does not appear to have been raised in the courts below nor by the respondent\u2019s factum, and which nevertheless has been pressed in this Court without any objection on the ground of prejudice. In any case, it invokes a statutory rule and the Court is bound to consider it. It is declared by s. 29 of the Executions Act, R.S.M., 1913, ch. 66, that:\nThe following personal and real estate are hereby declared free from seizure by virtue of all writs of execution issued by any court in this province, namely, * * * *\n(h) the land upon which the judgment debtor or his family actually resides or which he cultivates either wholly or in part, or which he actually uses for grazing or other purposes;\nProvided the same be not more than one hundred and sixty acres; in case it be more, the surplus may be sold, subject to any lien or encumbrance thereon.\nAnd by s. 34, it is provided that:\nThe judgment debtor shall be entitled to a choice from the greater quantity of the same kind of property or articles which are hereby exempted from seizure.\nIt is said in the appellant\u2019s factum that the Johnston farm was a 240 acre farm, but I see no evidence in support of that statement. The farm appears to have consisted of 320 acres, that is the statutory complement of a half section, and Mrs. Tencha says that in 1925 they sowed on the Johnston farm 150 acres of wheat, 20 acres of oats, and 100 acres of rye. She says, moreover, that there were 30 acres not worked or ploughed, and that the farm comprised in all 320 acres. This leaves 20 acres, the use of which is unaccounted for. The issue to be determined is whether the wheat and rye are liable to seizure under the execution: but transfers of property which is not available to creditors are not, I take it, avoided by the Statute of Elizabeth. Therefore I think the Statute may be taken as declaring, in its application to the case, that the 150 acres of wheat and 10 acres of rye are exempt, because the judgment debtor having a choice, which it would seem to be just that the claimant should exercise, would naturally elect for the exemption of the more valuable part of the crop. The plaintiff can therefore in these circumstances succeed upon the issue only as to nine-tenths of 632.52 bushels net brake and damp rejected rye. As to so much the plaintiff appears to be entitled to the proceeds. The plaintiff should have the costs of the interpleader order; and, as the costs with relation to the wheat and the rye are not separable upon any other basis, all other costs in all Courts should be apportioned pro rata according to the value of the grain as to which the respective parties succeed. Dixon v. Yates[18]; Lewis v. Holding[19]; Clifton v. Davis[20]; Annual Practice 1927, p. 1336.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault J., dissenting, was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014In this interpleader issue the question for determination is whether the grain seized by the sheriff under a writ of fieri facias issued by the plaintiff (appellant) against the lands of Ignace Tencha was liable to such seizure against his wife, Irene Tencha, the defendant.\nThe grain when seized was upon cars of the Canadian National Railway consigned to the Manitoba Wheat Pool by Irene Tencha, who was a member of that organization. It had been grown in the year 1925 on land known as the Johnston Farm, which had stood in her name in the land titles register since 1922, and for which she held a certificate of title.\nBy the Married Women\u2019s Property Act (R.S.M. 1913, c. 123, s. 5) it was enacted that\nall property which * * * * shall be, standing in, or allotted to, or placed, registered or transferred in or into, or made to stand in, the sole name of a married woman, shall be deemed, unless and until the contrary be shown, to be her property * * *; and she alone shall be entitled to deal therewith, and to receive the rents, issues, dividends, interests and profits thereof;\nand by s. 2 (6) \u201cproperty\u201d is defined as meaning\nany real or personal property, of every kind and description, of a married woman\nand as including\nall wages, earnings, money and property, gained or acquired by a married woman in any employment, trade or occupation in which she is engaged or which she carries on separately from her husband, and in which her husband has no proprietary interest * * *.\nApart, therefore, from any question of onus arising from the facts that the execution creditor is the plaintiff and the claimant is the defendant, the property in question must be regarded as that of Irene Tencha \u201cunless and until the contrary be shown\u201d by the execution creditor. Accordingly, the question for determination is: Did the evidence establish such an ownership of, or interest in, the consigned grain on the part of the judgment debtor, Ignace Tencha, as was exigible under the execution against him? The learned trial judge held that it did, explicitly resting that conclusion on the two distinct grounds:\n1. That the transfer to the wife was a fraudulent transaction, executed for the purpose of defrauding creditors of the husband by preventing the recovery of their claims against him, and that, although the land is registered in the name of the wife, it is not hers, and the crops grown thereon are his.\n2. That even if the farm were the property of the wife she was not carrying on the farming business separate and apart from her husband within the meaning of the statute, and, adopting the language of Mr. Justice Killam in the Slingerland v. Massey case[21], \u201cI cannot think that the legislature intended to protect from the husband\u2019s creditors the produce of his labour in an occupation which the wife allows him to carry on upon her lands\u2014or to permit him thus to bestow the fruits of his labour on his wife against his creditors.\nBy a majority the Court of Appeal reversed this decision, questioning the soundness of the finding that the transfer of the Johnston Farm to Mrs. Tencha was fraudulent and void as against her husband\u2019s creditors, but holding that, although it were, inasmuch as the transfer was inter partes intended to be effective and was not a mere sham and the farming operations had been carried on by Mrs. Tencha as proprietor and without her husband having any interest in or control over them, the grain seized was her exclusive property and was not exigible under the plaintiff\u2019s execution against the husband. The dissenting judges also expressed the views that\nthere is no issue on the record * * * that the transfer of land * * * was fraudulent against creditors\nand that a finding that it was\nis by no means conclusive of the question as to the ownership of the grain;\nand they agreed with the trial judge that\nthe question of how she (the wife) became the owner cannot be enquired into * * * in any way to affect her registered title, but it seems to me that it can be gone into for the purpose of ascertaining the bona fides of her (the wife\u2019s) claim to be engaged in the business of farming these lands separate and apart from her husband. In holding that the farming operations on the Johnston Farm were not carried on in 1925 by Mrs. Tencha separately from her husband, the learned trial judge rested his conclusion on some early decisions of the Manitoba courts, of which Striemer v. Merchants\u2019 Bank[22], is, perhaps, the strongest. These cases discussed the words \u201cwhich she carries on separately from her husband\u201d before the amendment had been made which attached to them the words: \u201cand in which her husband has no proprietary interest.\u201d They, in effect, held that if the husband resides with his wife on the farm and assists her in the raising of the crops, although the farm belonged to the wife and she conducted it on her own account, employing her husband to aid in the work, the crop is liable to seizure under an execution against the husband.\nThe learned judge did not find that the carrying on of the farming operations by Mrs. Tencha was merely colourable or a sham; and the evidence, as we read it, would not warrant such a finding. On the contrary, there is abundant evidence to support the view expressed by the learned judges who constituted a majority in the Court of Appeal that, after 1922, the farming operations on the Johnston Farm were actually and bona fide carried on by Mrs. Tencha on her own account and without her husband having any \u201cproprietary interest\u201d therein or any control thereof.\nIf the question whether Mrs. Tencha is the owner of the Johnston Farm as against the creditors of her husband were to be determined in this proceeding, we should have to consider the evidence very carefully indeed before holding that she is not. It seems to us extremely doubtful whether Ignace Tencha had any real or substantial equity in that farm\u2014whether the whole beneficial interest did not belong to Johnston and did not vest in Mrs. Tencha by virtue of his conveyance to her. But that issue is not before us and in our view its determination is of very little importance in deciding the ownership of the grain in question.\nWe shall, therefore, assume, but without so deciding, that the evidence of the circumstances under which Mrs. Tencha acquired the Johnston Farm justified the finding that the transfer of it to her was void as against the creditors of Ignace Tencha. We accept the view that such evidence was admissible as relevant to the question of the bona fides of Mrs. Tencha\u2019s claim that she had actually carried on the farming operations since 1922 separately and on her own account and that her husband had no proprietary interest therein. We are, however, satisfied that the conclusion of the majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal, that the operations were in fact so carried on by Mrs. Tencha, as she asserts, must also be accepted.\nWe are further of the opinion that the construction placed by the learned trial judge on the words of s. 2 (b) of the Married Women\u2019s Property Act was erroneous, and that the contrary view held by the majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal as to its meaning and effect was correct; and we agree in the unanimous view of that court, to quote from the dissenting judgment of Fullerton J.A., that\na finding that a transfer is fraudulent as against creditors is by no means conclusive of the question as to the ownership of the grain.\nOn the point last mentioned the various provincial Courts of Appeal appear to have uniformly held that the invalidity of the title of the transferee of land as against an execution creditor of the transferor by no means determines the right of such creditor to have crops grown on the land taken under his execution. It was so decided in Ontario, in 1867, in the case of Kilbride v. Cameron[23], by the Court of Common Pleas (Adam Wilson and John Wilson JJ.) affirming Richards C.J. So far as we can ascertain, that decision has never since been questioned and has been followed and approved in recent years by the Supreme Courts of the Western Provinces in cases cited in the judgments of Dennistoun and Trueman, JJ.A., in the Court of Appeal.\nIt was pointed out in the Kilbride Case23 by Adam Wilson J., that\nthe parties intended to pass the estate in the land by the different conveyances\nand that\nthere was no proceeding whatever which directly impeached the land transfer, for the execution was against goods, not against lands The admission, he said, that the\ntransactions as to the land were not valid as against the creditors of the father * * * would by no means determine the right of property to the crops in question.\nJohn Wilson J., said\nIf * * * as against creditors (the conveyances) were fraudulent and void, the crops would not belong to the (transferor); but if * * * the whole was colourable only * * * then the crops were the property of John Kilbride (the grantor).\nThe last of the decisions cited, Standard Trusts Co. v. Briggs[24], was rendered by the Court of Appeal for Alberta. The circumstances very closely resemble those now before us. Indeed they were stronger in favour of the execution creditor, inasmuch as the land had there been transferred to the wife after the execution against her husband had issued and the wife admitted that the farming operations were carried on by her and as her separate business, although with her husband\u2019s assistance, because of the existence of the execution against him. The judgment of the Court was delivered by Harvey C.J.A., who said, at p. 833:\nEven if the conveyance of the land were fraudulent\u2014Kilbride v. Cameron[25], and Johnstone Lbr. Co. v. Eager[26], show that crops raised by the transferee do not belong to the transferor. The crops in question were, of course, not transferred by the husband to the wife. If they ever were his, his creditor has a right to seize them. If they were not, equally, the creditor has no such right. The question is really whose business the farming operations which produced the crops, was * * *\nand, at p. 835,\nIn the present case the only oral testimony is that of the wife. She is quite evidently a very clear minded, intelligent woman and one may judge quite capable of managing any ordinary business enterprise. The learned trial judge made no finding of fact whatever helpful as to the decision whether she is the real manager of the farming operations * * *\nand, at p. 836,\nThere is no law of which I am aware that gives an execution creditor the right to compel the debtor to work for him though we have laws which impose obligations upon a man to provide for his wife and children. The plan adopted here was for the purpose of enabling the husband to work efficiently, to perform his legal obligations to his family without furnishing his creditor with the opportunity to deprive them of the fruits of his labour. When the wife was asked if she paid her husband anything for his labour she said she did not but that he was receiving the same reward for his labour that she had received for hers during the preceding 12 years of their married life. She said, however, that she employed and paid all the hired labour that was required and paid all other expenses and, while her husband apparently worked much as he had done before, she and her children also themselves worked to some extent in the fields and that her husband in respect to any acts of management acted as her foreman.\nThe resemblance between these facts and those of the case now before us is very striking. The Court (Harvey C.J.A., Beck and Clarke JJ.A.) set aside the judgment of the trial judge in favour of the execution creditor.\nIn our opinion the statement of the law, bearing on the question now being considered, in Kilbride v. Cameron[27] and the decisions following it is correct. But, if we thought its soundness dubious, we should hesitate to reject a view so distinctly enunciated and which has prevailed so long and has been so uniformly acted upon. We, accordingly, agree with what appears to have been the unanimous opinion of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in the present case that, although the transfer of the land to the wife should be deemed a fraudulent transaction as against the creditors of the husband, it does not follow that he had an interest in the crops which would make them seizable under an execution against him.\nOn the second ground taken by the learned trial judge we are of the opinion with the majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal that the grain in question was \u201cproperty acquired\u201d by the respondent in an\noccupation in which she is engaged or which she carries on separately from her husband, and in which her husband has no proprietary interest\nwithin the meaning of clause (b) of s. 2 of the Married Women\u2019s Property Act, R.S.M., 1913, s. 123.\nOnce the conclusion is reached that the carrying on of the farming operations by Mrs. Tencha was not a mere sham but was bona fide intended to be for her exclusive benefit and that her husband had no proprietary interest therein or control thereof, we are satisfied that the facts that he resided on the farm and aided in the farming do not prevent the wife from claiming the crops grown as her own to the exclusion of his creditors. We should have viewed the farming operations as having been carried on by Mrs. Tencha \u201cseparately from her husband\u201d had the case arisen under the Manitoba Married Women\u2019s Property Act of 1892, i.e., before the addition of the words: \u201cand in which her husband has no proprietary interest.\u201d We agree with the construction placed on the words \u201ccarried on separately from her husband,\u201d as they stood in the early Ontario statute, by Spragge C.J.O., and Cameron J., in Murray v. McCallum (1), rather than with the narrower construction given them by Burton and Patterson JJ.A. That the Ontario Legislature intended that the view taken by the two former judges of the effect of the legislation should prevail was made clear by its action in substituting in 1887 the words: \u201cand in which her husband has no proprietary interest\u201d for the words: \u201cseparately from her husband.\u201d (50 V., c. 7, s. 22).\nIn Manitoba, instead of making such a substitution, the Legislature in 1900 merely added the words: \u201cand in which her husband has no proprietary interest,\u201d leaving the words \u201cseparately from her husband\u201d still in the Act. (63-64 V., c. 27, s. 2 (2)). Unless the words so added be regarded as designed to indicate the view of the legislature that the phrase: \u201cSeparately from her husband\u201d shall be taken to mean what Cameron J. (at p. 306) held it did in Murray v. McCallum[28], it is difficult to understand why these words were inserted. If that be not their effect they are mere surplusage. It should, perhaps, be noted that the Manitoba statute speaks of an \u201coccupation\u201d carried on by the wife \u201cseparately from her husband,\u201d and not \u201cseparately and apart from her husband\u201d as the learned trial judge expressed it.\nWhere the occupation is bona fide carried on as the business of the wife and without her husband having any proprietary interest in it or any right of interference in or control over it\u2014when he takes no part in it other than as his wife\u2019s employee\u2014the facts, that he resides with and aids her in carrying it on, do not prevent its being, for the purposes of the Married Women\u2019s Property Act, her business and an occupation carried on separately from her husband. As Osier J.A., in delivering the judgment of the Court in Baby v. Ross[29], said, at p. 446:\nThere is no law which compels (the husband) to work for his creditors if he chooses to live in idleness, or which prevents him from giving away his time and services, or devoting them towards satisfying one creditor\u2019s demand. The arrangement (that he should work for his wife alone, she receiving the whole of the proceeds and he getting nothing but his board) which the plaintiff complains of was neither unreasonable nor illegal; and I am unable to comprehend on what principle it can be said to be a making away of property in order to defeat or defraud creditors.\nWe have not overlooked the provision of s. 14 of the Married Women\u2019s Property Act of Manitoba that\nnothing in this Act contained shall give validity as against creditors of the husband to any gift by a husband to his wife, of any property, in fraud of his creditors.\nThe only gift suggested to have been made by Tencha to his wife is of the land comprised in the Johnston Farm. The title to that farm is not in issue; we determine nothing as to it; and the plaintiff is entirely at liberty to impeach it in any way in any other proceeding it may be advised to take. There was no gift of the crops by Tencha to his wife. He never had any interest in, or claim upon, them which could be the subject of such a gift. Section 14 has no bearing on the matter of which we dispose.\nWe are, for these reasons, of the opinion that the judgment a quo is right and should be affirmed.\nAppeal allowed in part\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

The insurance company having given notice of the appointment of an arbitrator under statutory condition no. 2, and the appellant having refused to appoint an arbitrator, the respondent applied for an order directing such an appointment, and also for an order for a stay of proceedings pending the arbitration. Both applications were dismissed by the trial judge; and the Court of Appeal allowed both appeals.\nHeld, that if in fact there had been an election by the respondent to take advantage of the re-instatement clause, the appellant was entitled to enforce the obligation to re-instate, and in respect of the appellant's claim for damages for failure to do so, the arbitration clause would have no operation, and the respondent would not be entitled either to an order directing the appointment of an arbitrator or to a stay. It was ordered that the issue of election or no election should be determined, and on the determination of that issue, further proceedings should take place, as stated in the judgment now reported. Observations upon waste of time and money in trivial and technical disputes, especially where the amount involved are insignificant.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] reversing the judgment of Hunter C.J. and granting an order appointing an arbitrator and another order staying all proceeding in an action on a fire insurance policy pending the arbitration.\nL. G. McPhillips K.C. for the appellant.\nC. W. Craig K.C. for the respondent.\nAt the conclusion of argument by counsel, the judgment of the court was orally delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014If, as the appellant alleges, the respondent company did elect to take advantage of the re-instatement clause in the policy, then, the appellant, having asserted his right to enforce the company's obligation to re-instate, would have no right to indemnity, pursuant to the proofs of loss; and the arbitration clause would never come into play.\nThe company therefore was not entitled to a stay of proceedings under the Arbitration Act until it had been determined that there had been no election.\nIf, on the contrary, there was no election, there was no reason for refusing the application of the respondent for an order for the appointment of an arbitrator or a stay of proceedings.\nTherefore the judgment of the Court of Appeal, as well as the orders made on the respondent company's two applications, should be set aside.\nThe dispute as to the alleged election could be decided on the hearing of the company's application for a stay, if both parties should so desire; but if they do not agree upon that course, then upon delivery of the statement of defence, an issue should be directed to determine that dispute. If the issue be decided in favour of the appellant, the action should proceed for the disposition of the claim for dam- ages; and, if otherwise, further proceedings in the action should be stayed, and the arbitration proceeded with.\nMeantime, the applications for a stay and for the appointment of an arbitrator should be kept on foot.\nThe appellant should have the costs of the present appeal and the respondent those of the appeal to the Court of Appeal.\nThe costs already incurred are quite disproportionate to the importance of the matters in dispute, and it is hoped that all parties will concur in a serious effort to avoid waste of time and energy in barren quarrels about questions of practice, and to have the questions of substance disposed of as speedily and inexpensively as possible.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McPhillips & Duncan.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Walsh, McKim, Housser & Molson.\n[1] See [1927] S.C.R. 451.\n[2] [1927] 2 W.W.R. 456.\n",

The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed with costs.\nF. R. Taylor K.C. for the appellants.\nHarold Fisher K.C. and G. H. V. Belyea K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014In their statement of claim the plaintiffs allege that they are the owners of certain lands described therein (which border upon a portion of Wood lake) together with all the fishing privileges and other rights in or to the said lake. They also allege that the defendants trespassed upon their said property, broke down the fences, and broke and destroyed the locks on the buildings situated thereon, and they claim an injunction restraining the defendants from further trespassing upon the property and damages for the trespass already committed. In their statement of defence the defendants, who are members of the Wood Lake Fishing Club, set up that at the time of the alleged trespass they had possession of the said property and had the right of possession thereto under and by virtue of a lease thereof, dated the first day of June, 1916, from Patrick H. Nugent, the then owner, to Martin R. Dolan, who, they alleged, took the lease as trustee for the members of the Wood Lake Fishing Club. The lease was for a term of ten years and the rent reserved $50 per year. Both Patrick H. Nugent and Martin R. Dolan died before the expiration of the term granted, and it is not disputed that the plaintiffs are the present owners of the property or that the defendants entered upon the property and committed acts thereon which would constitute trespass if not done under legal right.\nThe defendants justify their entrance upon the property under a clause in the lease which reads as follows:\u2014\nAnd the said Patrick H. Nugent for himself, his heirs, executors and assigns covenants, promises and agrees to and with the said Martin R. Dolan, his executors, administrators and assigns that he the said Patrick H. Nugent, his heirs, executors and assigns shall if requested by the said Martin R. Dolan, his executors, administrators or assigns at least three months before the expiration of the term hereby demised, pay to the said Martin R. Dolan, his executors, administrators or assigns a sum of not more than five hundred dollars for the buildings now upon the said property and any further buildings that may be erected or built upon the said property during the term hereby created if being thereon at the expiration of the said term, or else grant a new lease of the aforesaid premises to the said Martin R. Dolan, his executors, administrators or assigns for the further term or time of ten years to commence from the expiration of the said term hereby granted and also a further renewal of the said lease for a further term of ten years after the expiration of the said preceding terms at and under the same yearly rent, payable half-yearly as aforesaid.\nThis clause, the defendants contend, gave them an option, at the expiration of the term demised upon giving the required notice, either to demand payment for the buildings they had placed upon the lands or to have a renewal of the lease\u2014whichever they might desire. They also contend that they duly requested a renewal of the lease from the present owners but failed to obtain it, and in their counterclaim they ask that specific performance of the covenant be decreed and that the plaintiffs be ordered to execute a renewal lease of the premises. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that the above clause, on a true construction thereof, gives an option to the lessor either to pay for the buildings or grant a renewal of the lease\u2014whichever he may choose.\nThe evidence shews that prior to the expiration of the lease the plaintiffs offered to pay to the Fishing Club $500 for the buildings on the property. The learned trial judge upheld the defendants\u2019 contention and construed the clause as follows:\u2014\nI am of the opinion that the meaning of the condition of the lease relating to the renewal is that if the lessee so requested the lessor at least three months before the expiration of the lease, he, the lessor, would pay him $500 for the buildings upon the demised premises and the lease would expire and the term of the demise end. Should the lessee not wish to take this course but desire a renewal of the term he must request the lessor to grant a new lease which would be granted upon the same terms as to rental that prevailed with the original lease.\nUpon appeal the majority of the Appellate Division upheld this construction, while Hazen C.J. construed the clause as giving to the lessor the option of renewing the lease or paying for the buildings.\nFrom the judgment of the Appellate Division the plaintiffs now appeal to this Court.\nThe first question we have to determine is, has this Court jurisdiction to hear the appeal? We are of opinion that it has. The matter in controversy is the right of the defendants to a lease of the property in question for ten years at a rental of $50 a year. The evidence shews that the property has an annual rental value of at least $400. If the defendants\u2019 contention be correct the plaintiffs will receive a rental of $50 a year, or a sum of $500 for the next ten years. If the plaintiffs\u2019 contention be correct the rental received by them for the next ten years would probably amount to not less than $4,000. The difference between these two sums is, in our opinion, the value of the matter in controversy in this action and it is more than sufficient to clothe the court with jurisdiction.\nThe next question is as to the construction to be placed upon the clause above quoted. We are of the opinion that the construction placed upon it in the dissenting judgment of Hazen C.J., is the correct one. The material words of the clause are \u201c. . . Patrick H. Nugent * * * shall if requested by the said Martin R. Dolan * * * three months before the expiration of the term * * * pay * * * a sum of not more than five hundred dollars for the buildings * * * or else grant a new lease of the aforesaid premises * * *.\u201d\nWe find no ambiguity in this language. Nugent here was agreeing to do one of two things; he would, upon request, at the expiration of the ten years either pay for the buildings or renew the lease. The natural and ordinary meaning of the language used is that he had the choice, that the option was his, not Dolan\u2019s. The words \u201cor else grant a new lease\u201d imply an alternative, and the renewing of the lease was the alternative of paying for the buildings. To give the clause the construction placed upon it in the courts below would require, as pointed out by Hazen C.J., the insertion of the words \u201cif not so requested\u201d between \u201celse\u201d and \u201cgrant,\u201d so as to make it read \u201cor else, if not so requested, grant a new lease.\u201d This, in our opinion, would be altering the meaning of the unambiguous language of the clause and making a new contract for the parties.\nAs the defendants have failed to justify the acts of trespass alleged against them the appeal must be allowed with costs both here and in the courts below. As the actual damage resulting from the trespass was slight and was not of the real substance of the action the plaintiffs will have nominal damages only. They are, however, entitled to an order restraining the defendants from further trespassing upon the premises.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Fred. R. Taylor.\nSolicitor for the respondents: George H. V. Belyea.\n",

That he was during the year 1926, and previously thereto, a producer of the products of flori culture, plant culture and vegetable culture.\n2. That he did during the year 1926, produce flowering plants of miscellaneous varieties and having cut flowers from the plants so produced, did sell the same within British Columbia, namely, cut flowers to the retail trade and did not account for and pay consumption or sales tax in respect thereof.\n3. That he did, during the year 1926, and previously thereto, produce and sell to the retail trade within British Columbia, potted plants which said potted plants were not capable of being propagated and grown from year to year wholly out of doors and without the protection of glass or any like protection. The plaintiff admitted the following facts:\n1. That the defendant operates a green-house with an adjoining plot of land classed and assessed as agricultural land as distinguished from building lot, and either in the green-house or on the adjoining land he grows the following classes or products:\n(a) Cut flowers from plants or bulbs, such as chrysanthemums, carnations, hyacinths, tulips, etc.\n(b) Flowering plants sold in pots so that the ultimate purchaser will have them at the time of their early and full blooming, such as lilies, begonias, azaleas, calceolaria, geraniums, fuschias, cinnerarias, calceolaria (hybrid).\n(c) Bulb plants, likewise in pots sold so that the ultimate purchaser will have them at the time of early and full bloom, such as cyclamen, primulas, hyacinths.\n(d) Plants sold in pots such as ferns, palms, rubber plants, auralias.\n(e) Annual flowering plants sold sometimes in pots or flats, sometimes as individual plants such as asters, stocks, zinnias, lobelia, sunflowers, marigolds.\n(f) Annual plants for the growth of vegetables sold in flats or pots, or as individual plants such as cabbage, celery, tomatoes, cucumber, cauliflower.\n(g) Perennial plants such as calceolaria, lupin, digitalis, poenies, primulas, delphinium, bellis, pyrethrum.\n(h) Vegetable and fruit products such as grapes, tomatoes, lettuce and cucumber.\n(i) Shrubs and trees such as rhododendrum, laurel, holly, etc.\n2. That the defendant sells his products to the retail and\/or wholesale trade.\n(a) Entirely within the province of British Columbia.\n3. That all of the products grown by the defendant are grown either under glass or in special plots of ground where they are reared and nurtured either to maturity as a finished product such as sub-paragraphs (a) and (h) of paragraph 1, herein, or reared to partial or near maturity or readiness for use or consumption such as the products mentioned in subparagraphs (b) to (g), inclusive, and sub-paragraph (i) of paragraph 1 herein.\n4. That the products mentioned in sub-paragraphs (e), (f), (g), and (i) of paragraph 1 are grown by the defendant to partial maturity only and require further growth and cultivation before they are ready for consumption or achieve the object of their growth, and the products mentioned in sub-paragraphs \"b,\" \"c\" and \"d\" of paragraph 1 hereof, may or may not, but generally do require further growth and cultivation before they are ready for consumption or achieve the object of their growth.\n5. That all of the products grown by the defendant up to the time or sale or delivery by the defendant require and receive nurture and special care, attention and protection (including artificially controlled moisture and temperature) for production.\n6. That the products mentioned in paragraph 1 hereof, sub-paragraphs (b), (c), (e), (f), and (h), are largely if not entirely nurtured by the defendant under glass or with special care and production in order to advance and stimulate their growth in advance of their natural season beyond what is possible if the same were grown without such care for production. 7. That all of the products grown by the defendant are products of the soil of his own production and are sold in their natural state by the defendant individually.\n8. That the defendant is a member of the British Columbia Hot House Association, an Association with an expressed aim or object to test the validity of the tax herein sued for in its application to the various products such as are grown by the defendant and that this action is a test action to that end and that the defendant in the bona fide belief that there is a question to be so tested has refused to take out any license or account for, up to commencement of this action, any tax for this purpose only.\nMurphy J. gave judgment for the plaintiff[2] which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nR. L. Reid K.C. for the appellant.\nE. Lafleur K.C. for the respondent.\nAt the conclusion of the argument the judgment of the Court was orally delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014We are all of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nThe question shortly is, whether or not the phrase \"nursery stock,\" as used in subs. 4 of s. 19 BBB of c. 8 of 5 Geo. V, includes cut flowers and potted plants, with the result that sales of such articles by florists are exempt from the sales tax.\nIt is not necessary to say anything further with regard to cut flowers. It seems perfectly clear to us that cut flowers cannot be brought within the term \"nursery stock.\"\nAs to potted plants\u2014\"nursery\" implies a place devoted to the cultivation of trees, shrubs, and plants\u2014for the purpose of transplantation; bringing them to a degree of maturity in which that is practicable.\nThat this is the signification of the word as used in the phrase in question is indicated by the quotation made from the Customs Tariff Act at page 4 of Mr. Lafleur's factum[3], and this view of the effect of the phrase is also borne out by the French version, in which nursery stock is described as \"plants de p\u00e9pini\u00e8re.\" The nursery is conceived by the statute as a \"p\u00e9pini\u00e8re,\" a place in which \"plants\" are grown for the purpose mentioned; the word describing the articles, as Mr. Lafleur points out, is \"plants\", not \"plantes\". Potted plants, in our view, are not within the ordinary meaning of the phrase \"nursery stock.\" We think the appeal should be dismissed, with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Dickie & De Beck.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Congdon, Campbell & Meredith.\n[1] (1927) 38 B.C.

Defendant, in paying under its bond, refused to pay part of the shortage on the ground that such part did not come within its bond, and plaintiff sued therefor. Held, affirming judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (37 B.C. Rep. 373), that defendant was not liable; on the evidence, the moneys in question were received by L. as the personal agent of one O., a secured creditor of the company, when acting under a power of attorney from O., authorizing L. to deal with O.'s securities, and given to facilitate the realization thereof; the moneys never belonged to, and were never accountable for by, the company of which L. was liquidator, and could not properly have been made the subject of a misfeasance order under said s. 123; while some of the moneys in question appeared to have passed into L.'s account kept by him as liquidator, payment thereof into that account was without authority and L. would have been, and was, within his rights as against the company in withdrawing them and placing them to his own personal credit; the condition of the bond had no application to the moneys in question.\nA claim by plaintiff for interest was disallowed, in view of the terms of the condition of the bond, and the absence of any order for payment of interest.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] which, reversing the judgment of Hunter C.J.B.C., held that the defendant was not liable under its guarantee bond in respect of the moneys in question. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nE. Lafleur K.C. for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014The company, of which the appellant is now official liquidator, was ordered to be wound up in June, 1916; the defendant Lockwood was appointed official liquidator in August of that year, and the guarantee bond, upon which the action was brought, was executed on the 25th of that month.\nAt the date of the winding up, one Ormrod was a secured creditor in $30,000 odd, that sum being due to him in respect of a loan made to the company by him in December, 1912. All the usual steps were taken in the winding up proceedings. No claim was made by Ormrod, and in two reports made by the district registrar of the court respecting claims of creditors, it was stated that there was no creditor holding security. In March, 1918, Ormrod executed a power of attorney, appointing Lockwood, described not as official liquidator, but simply as \" of 739 Hastings Street West, in the city of Vancouver, in the province of British Columbia, Broker,\" as his attorney, authorizing him to deal with the Ormrod securities as he might see fit; to execute all necessary conveyances; and to give receipts and discharges for all or any the sum or sums of money \"which shall come into his hands, in virtue of the powers herein contained.\"\nLockwood received no authority from the court to accept this power of attorney, and it is quite clear that it was given to him on the suggestion of Ormrod's Vancouver agents for the purpose of facilitating the realization of Ormrod's securities. Lockwood proceeded to realize these securities by acquiring titles to properties affected by them, and to dispose of the properties. The details of these proceedings are immaterial, although it may be observed that a considerable part of the proceeds of each security was paid by Lockwood direct to Ormrod's agents, Richards & Company, apparently without any authority from the court. Lockwood's accounts having been investigated by auditors, a shortage was reported of $18,329.02, and on the 26th of May, 1923, an order was made, giving the appellant liberty to prosecute proceedings against Lockwood, under s. 123 of the Winding-Up Act; and on the 12th of June, 1923, an order was made declaring Lockwood guilty of misfeasance and breach of trust in relation to the company, and directing him to pay that sum to the appellant, together with the expenses of audit and costs. In July, 1923, the respondent company paid to the appellant the sum of $8,217.75, being the difference between the total misappropriation reported by the auditors and the moneys included therein which were alleged to belong to Ormrod. The present action was brought at the instance of Ormrod, who agreed to indemnify the appellant against the costs of the action. At the trial, the appellant's claim was sustained, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal except as to certain items not material to be considered, Macdonald C.J.A., dissenting. The bond, upon which the action is brought, is upon the condition that \"the said Herbert Lockwood *** shall truly account for what [he] shall receive or become liable to pay as Official Liquidator *** at such periods and in such manner as the Judge shall appoint, and pay the same as the Judge hath by the said orders directed, or shall hereafter direct.\" And the question is whether the moneys sued for were received by Lockwood as official liquidator, or are moneys which he became liable to pay as official liquidator.\nThe evidence seems to establish clearly that these moneys were received by Lockwood as the personal agent of Ormrod, when acting under the power of attorney above mentioned. They never were at any time the moneys of the company, and never could properly have been made the subject of a misfeasance order under s. 123 of the Winding-Up Act. The order of the 12th of June, 1923, appears to have been, as regards these moneys, an order made without jurisdiction.\nIt is contended on behalf of the respondent company that the condition of the bond above quoted applies only to moneys which are the moneys of the company within the meaning of s. 123. It does not appear to be necessary to decide whether or not that is the true construction of the bond. It seems sufficiently clear that the condition is limited in its application at least to moneys which are the moneys of the company or moneys in respect of which the company is by law accountable to others. Some of the moneys in question, it is true, seem to have passed into Lockwood's account kept by him as official liquidator, but the payment of these moneys into that account was a payment wholly without authority, and he would have been, and was, quite within his rights as against the company in withdrawing them, and placing them to his own personal credit. It is difficult to see upon what principle the company could be charged with responsibility in respect of such moneys. Such being the case, it appears to me that the language of the condition has no application to the facts.\nA point was argued by Mr. Lafleur with some elaboration, to the effect that on a true view of the accounts, the shortage in respect of the company's moneys (that is to say, moneys which were admittedly such), after allowing for the sum paid by the respondent company, was sufficient to justify the judgment. The point was very fully considered on the argument, and a further examination of the record leaves no doubt in my mind that there is no sufficient ground for doubting the accuracy of the auditor's report.\nA further question is raised as regards interest. As respects that question, the answer of the respondent company seems conclusive. The condition provides for the payment of moneys received and for moneys he is \"liable to pay *** at such periods and in such manner as the judge shall appoint.\" There has been no order in respect of the payment of interest, and that claim, in consequence, must also be disallowed.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Walsh, McKim, Housser & Molson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Pattulo & Tobin.\n[1] 37 B.C.

The patent had been granted to plaintiff as the assignee of one McBride, and was for an alleged new and useful improvement in brake band lining machines. The appeal was dismissed with costs. The judgment of the court, delivered by Duff J., said in part as follows:\n\u201cIt is not disputed that Cady\u2019s machine is the mechanical equivalent of McBride\u2019s. The learned trial judge has found as a fact that Cady\u2019s machine was completed in 1918, and that McBride\u2019s work did not pass beyond the experimental stage until the 1st of July, 1919; in other words, that McBride had not reduced his ideas to definite and practical shape until after Cady\u2019s invention was completed.\u201d\n\u201cThere appears to be no satisfactory ground for disagreeing on these points with the learned President of the Exchequer Court, but I have come to the conclusion also that McBride\u2019s action must fail on the second ground, namely, that there was no patentable invention. There is nothing new, either in McBride\u2019s devices or in the end he sought to attain, except that these devices were applied by him to a new material. Machines had been constructed for boring and countersinking in one operation, and devices were well known for guiding the operation so that th\u00e9 axis of the hole bored in the blind side of the material should correspond with the axis of the existing hole. Then the stop for limiting the depth of the countersink was a perfectly well known device; indeed, the uncontradicted evidence is to the effect that every commercial press operated by power contains that element.\u201d\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nO.

Baxter Brothers et al\n1927: February 9; 1927: April 20.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN JJ.\nContract\u2014Date\u2014Evidence\u2014Date of mailing\u2014Findings of fact in courts below\u2014Farm Implement Act, R.S.S. 1920, c. 128, ss. 19, 31.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] affirming the judgment of Bigelow J., who held that the making of the contract between the plaintiff and defendants was not completed until May 10,1920; that, therefore, s. 31 of the Farm Implement Act, R.S.S., 1920, c. 128, applied, the contract was invalid, and the plaintiff\u2019s claim under it must fail.\nThe contract was for the sale of certain farm implements from the plaintiff to the defendants. In certain respects it did not comply with s. 31 of said Act. S. 31, by its terms, applies to contracts made after 31st March, 1920. S. 19 of the Act provides that\nThe signing of such contract by the purchaser shall not bind him to purchase the implement therein described until the same is signed by the vendor or some agent * * * and a copy thereof is delivered to or deposited in a post office addressed to the purchaser, postage prepaid and registered.\nThe question was whether a binding contract was completed within s. 19 on or before the 31st March, 1920, so as to avoid the application of s. 31. This depended on the question of fact whether or not the plaintiff, as was contended, actually deposited a copy of the contract in the post office addressed to the defendants, postage prepaid and registered, on or before the 31st March, 1920.\nAfter hearing counsel on behalf of the appellant and the respondents, the Court reserved judgment, and on a subsequent day delivered judgment dismissing the appeal with costs, Newcombe J. dissenting.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nF. L. Bastedo K.C. for the appellant.\nP. H. Gordon K.C. for the respondents.\n[1] 21 Sask. L.R. 81; [1926] 2 W.W.R. 805.\n",

MOTION by the respondent to quash the appeal by the defendant to this Court from the judgment of th\u00e8 Exchequer Court of Canada[1] on the grounds (1) That the Court had not jurisdiction to hear the appeal; (2) That the appeal was devoid of merit and substance and was taken against good faith; and (3) That the appellant had unduly delayed to prosecute his appeal.\nW. D. Herridge for the motion.\nM. Powell contra.\nAt the conclusion of the argument, the judgment of the court was orally delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C\u2014We are all of the opinion that the motion should be granted. There is every appearance of bad faith. The action in the Exchequer Court from the first was admittedly allowed to proceed on the erroneous assumption that the defendant was still carrying on the business. The proceedings, except as to the claim for damages, were thus rendered useless. The court was allowed to go through the idle form of granting an injunction in complete ignorance of what the defendant well knew would render it of no avail because he had parted with his interest to the company formed to take it over and of which he is the President. When asked by the Court whether he would consent on behalf of the company to its being added as a party so that it might be bound by the determination of the appeal on the question of infringement, counsel for the defendant-appellant stated that he was without instructions to do so.\nUnder these circumstances, an appeal is brought to this Court against a judgment entered nearly a year ago, and although several terms have elapsed, that appeal is not yet inscribed. The delay is not satisfactorily explained. Should the appeal be allowed to go on, and fail, the respondent will then be obliged to proceed against the company, which will not be bound by the result. Such tactics should not be encouraged by the granting of indulgence. The appellant is in grave default.\nWe are satisfied that the motion should be granted, and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\n[1] [1926] Ex. C.R. 158.\n",

The contract involved the erection by the purchaser of a 26 storey building, four floors of which were to be leased to the Canadian National Railways, and five floors to the Department of Customs and Excise, and it was apparent from the claimant\u2019s letter that the successful financing of its project depended on these leases being entered into, and that the failure to obtain them was the substantial basis of its claim. Several cabinet ministers took part in the negotiations for the alleged contract, and it was the subject of cabinet discussions and Orders in Council. The Acting Minister of Railways and Canals, purporting to act under s. 38 of the Exchequer Court Act, referred the claim, as set out in claimant\u2019s letter, to the Exchequer Court. The Crown subsequently moved for permission to withdraw the reference, or, alternatively, for the statement of claim to be struck out, on the grounds: (1) that the reference was not authorized by s. 38, and was, therefore, ultra vires of the Minister of Railways and Canals; (2) that an Order in Council purporting to direct the withdrawal was effective, if the reference had been validly made; and (3) that the statement of claim as delivered was not within the purview of the reference authorized. The motion was dismissed ([1927] Ex. C.R. 101) and the Crown appealed.\nHeld, this Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal, under s. 82 of the Exchequer Court Act; the rejection of the first and second grounds of the motion was tantamount to allowing a demurrer by the claimant to two prospective defences of the Crown, and effectively excluded them from the issues; moreover, the first ground challenged the Exchequer Court\u2019s jurisdiction, and the judgment affirming that jurisdiction was a final judgment.\nHeld, further, that the claim did not arise \u201cin connection with the administration of\u201d the Department of Railways and Canals, within s. 38 of the Exchequer Court Act; the project was a governmental undertaking, as distinguished from a merely departmental transaction; the Minister of Railways and Canals, if he executed the contract, was acting, not in the exercise of his administrative powers as such minister, but in the execution of a special authority deputed to him by the Government; the reference was, therefore, unauthorized, and the Exchequer Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the claim. On this ground, the appeal was allowed.\nDealing with the other grounds of the Crown\u2019s motion, it was held, that its contention that the reference had been withdrawn by Order in Council, was successfully met by claimant\u2019s answer of res judicata, this contention having been rejected by the Exchequer Court on a previous motion; that, as to the statement of claim, in so far as it might substantially depart from or exceed the claim set out in claimant\u2019s letter, it transcended the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court, which was restricted to the very claim referred to it by the Minister; but the objection in this respect (if a proper subject of appeal to this Court) presented matter for the exercise of discretion as to amendment, rather than a ground for striking out the claimant\u2019s pleadings or otherwise summarily determining its action.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing its motion for an order granting leave to withdraw a reference to that court of the claim against His Majesty presented by the claimants, or, alternatively, for an order striking out the statement of claim filed. The material facts of the case, and the grounds of the motion, are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed.\nLucien Cannon K.C. and C. P. Plaxton K.C. for the appellant.\nG. H. Kilmer K.C. and R. V. Sinclair K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The Crown appeals from an order of the Exchequer Court dismissing a motion made on its behalf that it be permitted to withdraw the reference to that Court of a claim against His Majesty presented by the claimants, or, alternatively, that their statement of claim be struck out. The Acting Minister of Railways and Canals, purporting to do so under s. 38 of the Exchequer Court Act, referred to that Court this claim, then before him in the form of a letter from the claimants, demanding payment of $981,000 damages said to have arisen from breach of an alleged contract for the sale by the Crown to their assignor of a certain property occupied by the Canadian National Railways, situate at the northwest corner of King and Yonge streets in the city of Toronto.\nThe motion before the Exchequer Court was based on three grounds:\n1. That the reference was not authorized by s. 38 of the Exchequer Court Act and was, therefore, ultra vires of the Minister of Railways and Canals:\n2. That an Order in Council purporting to direct the withdrawal of the reference was effective, if such reference had been validly made;\n3. That the statement of claim as delivered was not within the purview of the reference authorized.\nA question of the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the present appeal, raised by a preliminary motion to quash, stood over to the hearing on the merits and must now be dealt with.\nUnder s. 82 of the Exchequer Court Act, in any judicial proceeding in which the amount in controversy exceeds $500, there is a right of appeal to this Court from a final judgment of the Exchequer Court or a judgment pronounced by it upon any demurrer or question of law raised by the pleadings. In rejecting the first and second grounds of the Crown\u2019s motion, the Exchequer Court has determined that, assuming the facts to be as stated in the claimants\u2019 letter preferring the claim referred to the court, two grounds of defence, which might otherwise have been set up by the Crown, are not available to it because not good in law, inasmuch as it has held that the reference was validly made and that the Order in Council directing its withdrawal is without legal force. That is tantamount to allowing a demurrer by the claimant to two prospective defences of the Crown, and effectively excludes them from the issues to come before the court. Moreover, the first ground of the motion challenges the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court to entertain the claim, and the judgment affirming that jurisdiction is final. We are of the opinion that this appeal is, therefore, competent. It is within the intendment, if not within the literal terms, of s. 82 of the Exchequer Court Act.\nThe second ground of the Crown\u2019s present motion was, in our opinion, successfully met by the claimants\u2019 answer of res judicata.\nOn a previous motion by the claimants for an order that their claim be taken pro confesso for default in delivery of a statement of defence thereto by the Crown, the learned President of the Exchequer Court had rejected the Crown\u2019s answer that the reference had been withdrawn by Order in Council[2]. In his reasons for judgment he had said:\nI am of opinion that there was no authority for the withdrawal of the Reference by Order in Council, that the reference is still effective, and that the statement of claim is properly before the Court * * *. I am not aware of any statute or other authority which enables the Crown of its own motion to withdraw a reference, * * *\nIn disposing of the motion now before us the same learned judge, referring to the earlier motion, said[3]:\nRecently the plaintiff moved for judgment upon the ground that the respondent was in default in filing a statement of defence, which was refused, and th\u00e9 respondent was given further time to file his defence. Upon the hearing of that\u2019 motion before me, the respondent contended that the reference had been revoked by the Order in Council referred to, and I decided against this contention.\nThe ground that the reference had been withdrawn by Order in Council was, therefore, not open on the present motion.\nThe objection based on an alleged departure in the statement of claim from the terms of the reference authorized, while, no doubt, important (if a proper subject of appeal to this Court), seems to us rather to present matter for the exercise of discretion as to amendment than to afford a ground for striking the pleading from the records of the court or otherwise summarily determining the claimants\u2019 action.\nThe claim put forward in the statement of claim, we should perhaps assume, was intended to be that set forth in the claimants\u2019 letter upon which the reference was directed. Its purview must be gathered from the terms in which it is couched in the letter, since the document by which the reference was made reads as follows: IN THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nIn the matter of\nDOMINION BUILDING CORPORATION, LIMITED.....................................Claimants;\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING.........................................................................Respondent.\nReserving the right to plead and maintain that the said Dominion Building Corporation, Limited, is not entitled to any compensation, I hereby refer to the Exchequer Court of Canada the annexed claim of the said Dominion Building Corporation, Limited, for compensation alleged to be due by reason of the allegations therein set forth.\nDated at Ottawa, this sixteenth day of September, 1926.\n(Sgd.) H. L. Drayton,\nActing Minister of Railways and Canals.\nTo the Registrar of the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nThe \u201cannexed claim\u201d was the claimants\u2019 letter of the 4th of September, 1926. In so far as the claim set forth in the statement of claim may substantially depart from or exceed that contained in the claimants\u2019 letter, it transcends the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court, which is restricted to the very claim referred to it by the Minister. For that claim only could judgment be given.\nThe first ground of the appellant\u2019s motion, and that most urgently pressed upon us, requires careful consideration.\nBy s. 38 of the Exchequer Court Act it is enacted that\nAny claim against the Crown may be prosecuted by petition of right or may be referred to the Court by the head of the department in connection with the administration of which the claim arises.\nThe important question now presented is whether the claim which forms the subject matter of the present proceeding arises \u201cin connection with the administration of\u201d the Department of Railways and Canals within the meaning of the section just quoted.\nIn construing that section it is important to note that, while \u201cany claim against the Crown may be prosecuted by petition of right,\u201d no doubt for convenience and to avoid the necessity of obtaining the fiat of the Governor General, which is essential to the filing of a petition of right, intra-departmental claims may be summarily referred by the presiding Minister. But such claims must arise \u201cin connection with the administration of\u201d the department and they must exclusively concern such administration.\nTaking up the claim as presented in the letter of the 4th of September, 1926, we find that, while the formal demand is for a sum of $981,000,\nthe amount which the undersigned (the claimants) have lost or are liable for, by reason of the cancellation of the contract\n(i.e., the contract for the purchase of the lands in question), the letter in describing the claim and the circumstances in which it is alleged to have arisen, says:\nIt was well understood from the inception of the negotiations by the Rt. Hon. the Prime Minister, by the Rt. Hon. the Minister of Railways and Canals, the Hon. the Minister of Public Works, and by other members of the Cabinet, * * * that the successful financing of this operation depended upon the leasing by the Canadian National Railways of the ground floor and three additional floors of the building, and also by (sic) the leasing by the Customs and Excise Department of the five other floors referred to in this letter, and it was well known that, until the passage of the necessary Orders in Council making it quite certain that the floors in question would be leased, definite arrangements which would enable the completion of the purchase, could not be made, and it was because of such knowledge by the Government and the members of the Cabinet, that the Government requested that the applications for the extensions of time to complete the said contract, be made.\nIn an earlier passage the claimants, referring to the Order in Council sanctioning the sale, had said:\nIt was a term of the Order in Council that, on obtaining possession of the premises on or before the 15th September, 1925, a twenty-six storey modem fireproof office building should be erected on the premises and on lands immediately adjoining the premises and formerly known as the Home Bank of Canada, Head Onice site, such building to be ready for occupation for the Canadian National Railways, as tenant, on rentals and for the time mentioned in the Order in Council, the obligation of the Canadian National Railways being to rent, for the time and on the terms mentioned in the Order in Council, the ground floor and three floors of the building.\nIt was part of the original negotiations that the Customs and Excise Department should also rent five floors of the building on the terms and for a time which was agreed upon, and provision for such renting was to be made by Order in Council, and an Order in Council to give effect to such arrangement was actually prepared on the 3rd of September, 1925, but, not having been passed, at the request of the Government, an extension of time to complete the purchase up to the 28th of September was asked for and was granted, it being expected that before that date the last-mentioned Order in Council would be passed. This Order in Council was not passed during the year 1925, and, from time to time, at the request of the Government, extensions of the time for completing the purchase were applied for and were granted. The last written extension-fixed the time for completion at the 30th of December, 1925, because it was intended to have a session of Parliament in the month of November, when the Government expected to be able to pass the necessary Order in Council to make the contract completely effective.\nIt is, therefore, apparent on the face of the claim, as referred to the court, that the leasing of the nine floors of the projected building\u2014four to the Canadian National Railways and five to the Department of Customs and Excise\u2014was an essential feature of the project of the claimants, so essential that its being successfully financed was wholly dependent on these leases being entered into and that without them the contract had no financial value to the claimants. Indeed their failure to obtain such leases is the substantial basis of the present claim, although in form it is a claim for breach of the contract of sale. The erection of the 26 storey modern fireproof office building was a term of the sale of the property to the claimants\u2019 assignor. The financing of the entire operation depended upon the claimants being assured of the two leases, one to the Canadian National Railways and the other to the Department of Customs and Excise.\nMoreover, the contract, with all its terms, must be considered as a whole. It was negotiated not by the Minister of Railways and Canals alone, but\nby the Rt. Hon. the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. the Minister of Railways and Canals, the Hon. the Minister of Public Works and by other members of the Cabinet as well as by the Canadian National Railways.\nThe claimants\u2019 letter in effect says so. The Minister of Customs and Excise must have been a party to the negotiations, inasmuch as they covered the leasing of floor space for his department. If, therefore, the contract for breach of which damages are claimed, was entered into, by His Majesty represented by the Minister of Railways, the latter, in executing that contract, was acting, not in exercise of his administrative powers as Minister of Railways and Canals, but in the execution of a special authority deputed to him by the Government. As Minister of Railways and Canals he could not bind the Departments of Customs and Excise and of Public Works, and it may be doubtful how far he could bind the Canadian National Railways. Yet, admittedly, unless engagements to take leases for the Department of Customs and Excise and for the Canadian National Railways were assured, the contract could not be carried out; it had no financial value to the claimants or their assignor. The whole project was a governmental undertaking, as distinguished from a merely departmental transaction. As such, it became the subject of cabinet discussion and of Orders in Council. So, too, in communicating the withdrawal of the Crown from the project, the Minister of Railways must have acted as the agent and representative of the Government. Only in that capacity could he properly take that action in regard to such a contract.\nFor these reasons, we are satisfied that the claim of the Dominion Building Corporation for damages for the repudiation of the alleged contract is not a claim which arises \u201cin connection with the administration of\u201d the Department of Railways and Canals, within the purview of s. 38 of the Exchequer Court Act. It follows that the Exchequer Court is without jurisdiction to entertain it.\nThe appeal must be allowed. Under the circumstances there will be no order as to costs.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. Stuart Edwards.\nSolicitor for the respondent: R. V. Sinclair.\n[1] [1927] Ex.

(Young v. Kershaw, 16 T.L.R. 52, at pp. 53-54, cited).\nAn action for specific performance of an alleged agreement for sale of a \u201cunit\u201d in a mining syndicate was dismissed at trial. Plaintiffs appealed, and, alternatively, asked for a new trial on the ground of discovery of new evidence. The Appellate Division, Ont., without passing on the main appeal, granted a new trial. Defendant appealed to this Court and asked that the judgment at trial be affirmed.\nHeld: The new trial should not have been granted; the proposed new evidence could have been ascertained with reasonable diligence before the trial; also, it could not conclusively establish plaintiff\u2019s case, as the fact proposed to be proved could not affect the judgment unless the relation of vendor and purchaser existed between the parties, and this Court, on the evidence, sustained the trial judge\u2019s finding that that relation did not exist. The appeal was allowed, and the judgment at trial, in its result, restored.\nAPPEAL by the defendant Varette from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, which vacated and set aside the judgment of Masten J. dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 action, and ordered a new trial.\nThe action was for specific performance of an agreement alleged to have been made by the defendant Varette for sale of a \u201cunit\u201d in a certain mining syndicate, or, in the alternative, for damages for failure to make delivery. Masten J. dismissed the action. The plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, asking for a reversal of the trial judgment, and in the alternative, for a new trial on the ground of the discovery of new evidence. The Appellate Division did not pass upon the main appeal, but granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial. The defendant Varette appealed to this Court, and asked that the judgment of Masten J. be affirmed. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed with costs, and the judgment of Masten J. restored.\nG.H. Kilmer K.C. and H.H. Davis for the appellant.\nW.N. Tilley K.C. and J.F. Boland for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014The Tremoy Lake Shore Mining Syndicate owned certain mining claims in the province of Quebec. It had already disposed of 90 per cent of its interests to the Noranda Mines Limited and the remaining 10 per cent was also under option to the same company. This 10 per cent interest was divided into 100 parts, called units or points; and between the members of the syndicate\u2014thirteen in all\u2014these units or points were held in unequal proportions formed of several entire units or portions of units. It was understood that, pending the exercise of its option by the Noranda company, each owner could deal with any of his units or portions of units as if they had been shares in a company.\nThe Noranda Mines Limited had formed The Horne Copper Corporation. For a time, and until the Noranda company exercised its option, the 10 per cent interest was represented by shares of the Horne corporation held by the syndicate in undivided ownership and evidenced by one certificate of that corporation. For that reason, the units were sometimes referred to as Horne units. A stock ledger was kept for the syndicate, in which the names of the transferees of units or portions thereof were successively registered.\nThe appellant Varette was a bookkeeper for a firm of contractors in New Liskeard and acted as secretary-treasurer for the syndicate. The respondents Sainsbury and Solloway were mining brokers of Toronto, having their offices together, and jointly interested in making commissions out of the sale of these units.\nOn the 16th September, 1925, Solloway wrote to Varette:\nI phoned you last evening and wired you to-day and am now awaiting a reply * * * I can place all the units amongst my friends that you can let me have at a reasonable figure. What I shall expect you to do is that you are in touch with the owners and you can get a price from them, make a fair profit for yourself and pass them on to me * * *.\nNo reply to this communication appears to have been made by Varette.\nAlmost two months later, on November 10, Varette wired to Solloway:\nI have offered to-day for sale subject to immediate acceptance one unit of Tremoy Lake Shore Mining Syndicate at $8,750 flat. If interested, wire at once.\nBoth parties agree that the telegram should be read: \u201cI am offered to-day, etc.\u201d or \u201cI have, offered to me to-day for sale * * *, One unit, etc.\u201d Solloway wired, on November 14, to Varette:\nWill accept your offer on Noranda unit at price quoted. Meet me on 47 to-morrow without fail as I cannot stop off.\nThe unit thus offered and accepted was subsequently taken up and there is no controversy over it.\nAs agreed, Solloway met Varette at the New Liskeard railway station, on the arrival of train no. 47. He confirmed the purchase already made and expressed his desire to buy other units. Varette said he might be able to send another; and it is this second unit that is the subject of the present litigation.\nSolloway was going into the north country and expected to be away for a few weeks. He told Varette that, during his absence, Sainsbury would act for him and would look after the units. By telegraph from New Liskeard he advised Sainsbury in Toronto of the result of his interview with Varette and again, by letter the same day from Ramore, a station further north. Telephone messages and telegrams were afterwards exchanged between Sainsbury and Varette concerning the forwarding of papers to complete the sale of the first unit and the possibility of procuring other units.\nOn November 21, Varette sent a telegram addressed to Solloway as follows:\nCan offer one unit same price delivered Toronto Wednesday morning.\nThis telegram went to Sainsbury in due course and the offer was accepted by telephone. At the same time, there was talk of a third unit.\nOn the 26th November, Varette telegraphed:\nOne unit leaving twenty-seventh. Have still one more. This will be the last available. Wire reply if satisfactory.\nThe \u201cone unit leaving twenty-seventh\u201d was the second unit, which is the subject-matter of this action. The \u201cone more\u201d unit referred to in the telegram was the third one, with which we are not concerned.\nThe second unit was never delivered. On November 30, Varette telegraphed:\nOther parties have offered more money. Cannot procure the unit offer (sic).\nSainsbury went to New Liskeard in an effort to procure units himself from the holders. He was offered one at $9,500. He could not go beyond $9,100, and could find none at that price. Sainsbury, having vainly attempted to procure delivery of the second unit from Varette, brought action for specific performance. He alleged he had entered into the agreement on behalf of C.A. Gentles and D.M. Hogarth, and they were joined as co-plaintiffs. At the beginning of the trial, Solloway was also added as a party plaintiff.\nThe action was dismissed by Masten J. on the ground that its subject-matter was realty and the Statute of Frauds afforded a sufficient defence. He also expressed the view that Varette \u201cnever agreed to act as a personal or direct vendor,\u201d but only \u201cas an agent in securing offers from members of the syndicate who were willing to sell one or more shares and submit them to Solloway.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs served the ordinary notice of appeal praying for the reversal of the trial judgment. They subsequently served a supplementary notice of motion to set aside the judgment upon the ground that the learned trial judge had erred in refusing an application made by them at the close of the trial to amend by claiming damages for breach of warranty of authority; and, in the alternative, for a new trial on account of the discovery of new evidence.\nThe Appellate Division did not pass upon the main appeal, but granted the motion for a new trial.\nVarette now appeals and submits that the judgment of the trial judge should be affirmed. The respondents, while upholding the order of the Appellate Division, contend that judgment should have been given in their favour and their action should be maintained.\nOn an application for a new trial on the ground that new evidence has been discovered since the trial, we take the rule to be well established that a new trial should be ordered only where the new evidence proposed to be adduced could not have been obtained by reasonable diligence before the trial and the new evidence is such that, if adduced, it would be practically conclusive. Young v. Kershaw[1].\nThe new evidence upon which the respondents based their application was produced\u2014as it had to be\u2014before the Court of Appeal and, for the present purpose, no other evidence can be relied on. The only new disclosure it makes is the precise date of the sale of a unit to one Tim- mins. The fact of the sale itself had already been stated by Varette in his examination for discovery and at the trial. Counsel for respondents then had full opportunity of cross\u2011examination, and the papers in respect of that transaction were produced. It was then noticed that the document evidencing the Timmins\u2019 sale did not bear a date; but it can hardly be contended that, with reasonable diligence, such date could not have been ascertained before the trial. The subsequent ascertainment of the exact date under those circumstances was not, in our view, a discovery of new evidence within the rule of law governing the right to a new trial.\nBut the respondents\u2019 application lacked yet another requirement, which is that the proposed new evidence would not conclusively establish the plaintiffs\u2019 case.\nEven assuming that the unit sold to Timmins was the same unit previously offered to Solloway on the 21st November\u2014an assumption at best doubtful upon the evidence of record\u2014that fact could not affect the judgment unless the relation of vendor and purchaser was proven to have existed between Varette and Solloway or Sainsbury. The trial judge held that such relation did not exist. The Appellate Division directed a new trial without hearing counsel for Varette on that point. It now becomes the duty of this court to consider that question.\nThe best way to approach this aspect of the case is first to determine with which of the two Toronto mining brokers, Solloway or Sainsbury, the appellant Varette contracted, if at all, in making the bargain alleged in connection with the second unit. Before deciding upon the intention of the parties to an agreement, it is, of course, necessary to ascertain who the parties were.\nIn our view, Solloway was the man with whom Varette made whatever bargain was made, and Sainsbury acted throughout merely on behalf of Solloway.\nIt should first be noticed that Sainsbury and Solloway both had desks in the same office in the Royal Bank Building. They were working together. In the words of Sainsbury:\nThe idea was that he (Solloway) had several prospective buyers for a number of units and we were working together.\nQ. You and Solloway were working together? Yes. The proposition for the purchase of the second unit came up during the conversation between Solloway and Varette at their meeting at the New Liskeard railway station on November 15. The agreement concerning the first unit was then concluded and Varette advised Solloway that he might be able to \u201cpick up\u201d some other units. Solloway said he was going to Lightning River and would be away possibly three weeks, but to send them down to his office, \u201cthat he had a man in his office who would look after it the same as if he were there.\u201d\nPrior to his leaving for the north, Solloway had told Sainsbury about his relations with Varette. Sainsbury knew of Varette\u2019s letter to Solloway of November 10 concerning the first unit and of Solloway\u2019s reply of the 14th November that he would take the unit. On that date, Sainsbury himself telephoned to Varette \u201cto tell him of the circumstances that Solloway was leaving and that he would take care of the business at this (the Toronto) end * * * in Solloway\u2019s place.\u201d Further, Sainsbury knew that Solloway was advising Varette to the same effect.\nAfter his interview with Varette at New Liskeard, on the 15th November, Solloway telegraphed to Sainsbury from Swastika:\nOne Horne unit (N.B.\u2014That was the first unit) going to Imperial Bank Monday at price quoted in letter stop Varette may be able to send another unit end of week. Present this telegram to Wilkinson as authority for you to get unit.\nHe confirmed this by letter from Ramore (another railway station up north) on the same day:\nI saw Varette and he promised me to send a Horne Unit to Imperial Bank to-morrow at same price he wrote me and to try and get me another unit by the end of the week.\nI wired you from Swastika to 304 Royal Bank. Now don\u2019t fail to take up the unit and don\u2019t fail to keep me a share of your profit.\nThere is no use of wiring Varette for units, as he will do his best to get another one.\nSainsbury admits that this letter made clear to him that Varette was buying a unit for Solloway.\nVarette got busy and on November 21 he was able to telegraph the offer of the second unit:\nCan offer one unit same price delivered Toronto Wednesday morning. Telephone me 157 New Liskeard.\nThis telegram was addressed to Solloway. In accordance with his arrangements with the latter, Sainsbury re- ceived and opened the telegram. He thereupon telephoned to Varette: \u201cI got your wire addressed to Solloway.\u201d He pretends having then told Varette that \u201che was the buyer and not Solloway\u201d and that afterwards he went on to deal with Varette under his own name. This is denied by Varette who swears positively that the offer was accepted \u201con behalf of Solloway.\u201d Varette\u2019s statement was accepted by the trial judge, who said: \u201cWhere his (Varette\u2019s) evidence differs or varies from that of Sainsbury and Solloway, I prefer the evidence of Varette.\u201d On the record, we agree with the learned trial judge and accept Varette\u2019s version, which is more consistent with the course of events and, moreover, does not present the difficulty involved in Sainsbury\u2019s story that he had taken advantage of Solloway\u2019s absence and had broken faith with him.\nWhen Solloway returned, he wrote Varette that Sainsbury had advised him that he was \u201csending two more units\u201d and thanked him \u201cfor this business.\u201d On the whole, the conclusion must be that, in these transactions, Sainsbury was \u201cSolloway\u2019s man.\u201d So Varette understood; and, in that he was perfectly justified. For that reason, he sent all his communications to the office where Sainsbury was acting in Solloway\u2019s place. There is no doubt that Sainsbury completed the transaction in respect of the first unit for Solloway\u2019s account. He acted in the same capacity with regard to the second unit. The agreement as to the latter, as in the case of the first one, was a bargain between Varette and Solloway, represented by Sainsbury.\nThe other question to be determined is what was, between Varette and Solloway, the agreement concerning this second unit. As already stated, it took form during the interview of Varette with Solloway at the New Liskeard railway station, on November 15. We have the account of that interview in a letter written shortly afterwards by Varette and with which Solloway expressed himself to be in complete accord. This letter derives singular value from the fact that, at the time it was written, Sainsbury was threatening suit. Solloway knew it and therefore was apt to be more careful in his assent to Varette\u2019s statements. It is nothing to the purpose that later, when called as a witness, he attempted to explain away the force of this assent on the ground that he had then no \u201cknowledge of the telegrams that had passed between Sainsbury and Varette.\u201d Knowledge of those telegrams could have no bearing on the question of what had been the original agreement between Varette and Solloway and the nature of the relations thereby created between them. In our view, moreover, these relations were not by the telegrams referred to modified in any essential particular.\nUpon returning from the North, Solloway had written to Varette, on November 28:\nDear Mr. Varette,\u2014I just returned to the city yesterday and Mr. Sainsbury advised me that you are sending two more units. I wish to thank you for this business and, upon receipt of this letter, I wish you would kindly write and let me know if there are any other units for sale and I shall be very grateful indeed if you will send on to me, at the Imperial Bank, Adelaide and Victoria Sts. Branch, Toronto, any units that come on the market, and advise me that they are coming.\nThanking you and hoping to hear from you at your earliest convenience, I am,\nYours very truly,\nI.W.C. SOLLOWAY.\nOn December 13, Varette wrote:\nDear Mr. Solloway,\u2014In going over my correspondence to-night for filing, I run across yours of November 28. (We leave out the passages having no reference to the point we are now discussing).\nThe day I met you at the Station I advised I had one unit and you said to pick up any more available\u2014that Sainsbury, acting for you, would look after same.\nI immediately set to work to obtain some more\u2014and got the promise of one and a partial promise on another, I did not have them tied up\u2014only a promise. In the meantime I wired Sainsbury, but also in the meantime word came from Toronto that some one was offering more money and I could not get the units. This offering of more money for four units, as far as I can find out, was only talk.\nI could not and have been unable so far to obtain anything further. I do not feel that I was dealing with Sainsbury at all, but with you under your instructions that Sainsbury was acting for you.\nThis is the exact position I am in at present and I told Sainsbury, when he was here, I would do the best I could. He advised that a writ would be issued against me if I did not produce.\nOn December 21, Solloway replied (and again we leave out whatever is unnecessary):\nDear Mr. Varette,\u2014I have been out of town and received your letter of December 13 yesterday. I am expecting you into the office should you come to Toronto and I will look forward with much pleasure to having a talk with you.\n* * *\nI quite agree with what you say in your letter and I do not see that they have any complaint to make. However I hope to see you in the near future.\nYours very truly,\nI.W.C. SOLLOWAY.\nAs will therefore appear, both Solloway and Varette agree on the crucial point that the understanding between them was not an agreement to transfer and sell, but only an agreement to procure units \u201cthat came on the market.\u201d We have already stated that, to our mind, the subsequent letters and telegrams exchanged with Sainsbury did not affect this original agreement. They are all reproduced in this judgment. Taken as a whole and viewed in the light of the initial interview with Solloway, they bear out the view taken by the learned trial judge that \u201cVarette never agreed to act as a vendor of his own shares\u201d and the relations of vendor and purchaser never existed between Varette and Solloway.\nThe result is that the motion for a new trial ought not to have been granted and that the appeal should be allowed, for the reasons we have given. Our judgment does not imply approval of the application made by the learned trial judge of the Statute of Frauds.\nNor do we express any opinion on the question of misrepresentation by Varette of his authority as an agent. The trial judge gave his reasons why he thought the amendment putting this claim forward should not be permitted and he did so without prejudice to the right of either Sainsbury or Solloway making this claim later. This was a matter of discretion with which this court would interfere only under most exceptional circumstances, which are not present in this case.\nThe appellant should have his costs here and in the Court of Appeal and the judgment of Masten J. should be restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.L. Smiley.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Macdonell & Boland.\n[1] (1899) 16 T.L.R. 52, at pp. 53-54.\n",

While the water in the lock was being lowered to enable her to pass out, the gates between the basin and the lock, being closed, were subjected to increasing pressure as the water below receded and they gave way releasing the water in the basin and causing the steamer to part her moorings and to break through the lower gates. While the J.B.K. was thus out of control, she came into contact with the respondent\u2019s tug V., causing damages for the recovery of which action was taken against the Crown. The trial judge held that, as it appeared upon the evidence that the breaking of the gates could only have occurred if they were not properly mitred by the servants of the Crown in charge thereof, the court should draw that inference of fact and find liability of the Crown for negligence under s. 20, subs, c of the Exchequer Court Act.\nHeld that, upon the evidence, there was a preponderance of probability which constituted sufficient ground for the finding of the trial judge: there was ample evidence that a faulty bevel- or mitre-joint would be a not improbable cause of the accident and there was no proof of any competing cause.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court ([1926] Ex.

The judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The respondent, suppliant by petition of right, seeks to recover damages for injury caused to its tug boat Virginia, with which, on 29th August, 1922, the SS. John B. Ketchum collided in the harbour of Montreal at the foot of the locks of the Lachine canal. While the Ketchum was lying in lock no. 1, moored to the side, and the water was being lowered to enable her to pass out, the gates of the basin above, being closed, were of course subjected to increasing pressure as the water below receded, and unfortunately they gave way, causing a great fall and surge of water, which carried the Ketchum from her moorings, through the lower gate, and out into the harbour. It was while the Ketchum was thus out of control, being swept along by the flood, that she came into contact with the Virginia, and it is admitted that the ensuing damage to the Virginia was caused by the breaking of the gates, which were intended on such occasions to hold back the water in the basin.\nThe canal was a public work of Canada, operated by the officers and servants of the Crown, and the question is whether the action was attributable to their negligence within the meaning of s. 20, clause (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, upon which the liability of the Government depends.\nThe evidence is found to exclude the suggestion of any defect in the construction of the gates, but it is found that they were not well closed, or, as said by the learned trial judge, that \u201cthey broke owing to improper mitring.\u201d His view was that when, in the process of closing, the gates were swung together by the lockmen under the direction of the lockmaster, they did not meet evenly, and that in consequence the bearing surfaces did not properly articulate. The witnesses who were charged with the work maintained that the gates were safely closed. But the circumstances of the case, the appearance of the gates after the accident, and the injuries which they had received, were consistent with and suggestive of the view that the damage was produced by pressure of the gates upon each other when in contact, but not truly joined; and there was ample evidence that the closing ought to have been effected with care in order to avoid such a result, and that a faulty bevel- or mitre-joint would be a potential and not improbable cause of their failure to withstand the great pressure to which they became subject when the level of the water in the lower lock was reduced.\nIt must be remembered that it was the duty of the lock-master and his men to see that an accident did not happen through lack of reasonable and proper care in the working of the gates, and the fact that such an extraordinary occurrence took place from a cause which, upon the evidence, may probably have consisted in their neglect, affords the basis of a finding, especially when, as in this case, there is no proof of any competing cause. I think there is here a preponderance of probability which constitutes sufficient ground for the finding of the learned trial judge.\nIn Cooper v. Slade (1), Willes J., refers to the proposition as elementary that in civil cases the preponderance of probability may constitute sufficient ground for a verdict, and he says that, so long since as the 14th of Elizabeth, Chief Justice Dyer and a majority of the other Justices of the Common Pleas laid it down that, when the parties are at issue the Justices may, if the matter be doubtful,\nfound their verdict upon that which appears the most probable, and by the same reason that which is most probable shall be good evidence.\nNewis v. Lark (2). I see no reason to doubt that the present case should be governed by that rule, and the appeal therefore fails.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Atwater, Bond & Beauregard.\n[1] [1926] Ex.

On the 25th of August, the plaintiff deposes he wrote a letter of acceptance which, duly addressed to the defendant, he gave to his son to post and it was mailed the same day: The defendant denied receipt of this letter. On the 6th of September, the plaintiff received from the defendant a letter withdrawing the offer of the 14th of August. The action is to compel the defendant to carry out the transaction.\nHeld that the decision of this court in Magann v. Auger (31 Can. S.C.R. 186), holding that the mailing of the plaintiff\u2019s letter of acceptance to the defendant constituted communication of it to him, has no application to a case where the offer is communicated, as in the present case, not by mail, but by other means. The Magann Case was one of contract by correspondence; and, the offer having been sent by mail, that was held to constitute a nomination by the sender of the post office as his agent to receive the acceptance for carriage to him. To make a contract the law requires communication of offer and acceptance alike either to the person for whom each is respectively intended or to his authorized agent.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, (Q.R. 43 K.B. 295) reversed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], varying the judgment of the Supreme Court at Montreal, de Lorimier J., and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case are stated in the judgment now reported.\nL. E. Beaubien K.C. and D. L. Desbois K.C. for the appellant.\nE. Lafleur K.C. and D. Baril for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The defendant, on the 14th of August, 1924, made an offer in writing to the plaintiff to purchase a certain property. He handed this document to one T. E. Baril, a representative of the plaintiff, for delivery to the latter. On the 25th of August, the plaintiff deposes, he wrote a letter of acceptance which, duly addressed to the defendant, he gave to his son to post and which was mailed the same day. The defendant denies receipt of this letter. On the 6th of September the plaintiff received from the defendant, mailed the previous day, a letter withdrawing the offer of the 14th of August. Evidence was given designed to raise a presumption of actual receipt by the defendant of the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance in due course of mail, i.e., on the 26th of August. The present action is to compel the defendant purchaser to carry out the transaction.\nOther questions arise as to undisclosed encumbrances affecting the property and the sufficiency and terms of the deed tendered to the purchaser for acceptance and as to the power of the court to amend the deed so tendered to make it conform to the plaintiff\u2019s offer. But these it is not now necessary further to consider.\nThe courts below, while they undoubtedly cast serious doubt on the defendant\u2019s denial of the receipt of the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance, refrained from making a finding on this question of fact, no doubt deeming it unnecessary because they regarded the judgment of this court in Magann v. Auger[2] as determining that the mailing of the plaintiff\u2019s letter of acceptance to the defendant constituted communication of it to him.\nWith great respect this is an erroneous view of the scope and effect of the decision of this court. That case was one of contract by correspondence, i.e., the offer was sent by mail and that was held to constitute a nomination by the sender of the post office as his agent to receive the acceptance for carriage to him. The civil law of Quebec was held to be the same in this regard as the law of England (p. 193). But this decision has no application to a case where the offer is communicated, as here, not by mail, but by another means. To make a contract the law requires communication of offer and acceptance alike either to the person for whom each is respectively intended, or to his authorized agent. Here there was nothing to constitute the post office the defendant\u2019s agent and a finding of actual receipt by him of the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance was, therefore, essential. The burden of procuring such a finding was upon the plaintiff. Without it he cannot succeed.\nWe are not in a position to pass upon this question of fact. Its solution depends upon the credibility of the defendant and that, in turn, largely upon the view taken of his demeanour as a witness\u2014thus presenting a question eminently for the tribunal which sees and hears him give his testimony.\nBut, under all the circumstances, we think that the plaintiff should, as a matter of indulgence, be given another opportunity to obtain, if he can, a finding that his letter was actually received by the defendant. Upon payment to the defendant of his costs of the appeals to the Court of King\u2019s Bench and to this court within one month, the plaintiff may have a new trial, the costs of the former trial to be in the discretion of the trial judge. In default of such payment, the appeal will be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D. L.

Rep. 161, holding the defendant liable to the plaintiff under a contract of re-insurance, was affirmed.\nIt was held that there had been a binding agreement of the plaintiff to insure, constituted by an oral arrangement by its agent with the insured prior to the fire; and that, on the construction of the communications between plaintiff and defendant prior to said agreement, the defendant had undertaken to re-insure the plaintiff, to an extent stipulated, in respect of risks to be assumed; and that, under the circumstances, the nature of the defendant's undertaking implied that its obligation was to arise immediately upon plaintiff becoming committed to liability; Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. [1893] 1 Q.B. 256, applied.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] affirming the judgment of D. A. McDonald J.[2] holding that the plaintiff was entitled to recover against the defendant on an alleged contract of re-insurance.\nAmong the facts found in the courts below, were the following:\nThe plaintiff and the defendant each carried on a fire insurance business in British Columbia. The plaintiff's general agent for the province was Rithet Consolidated Limited. The latter was also the defendant's agent at Victoria. Burrard Agencies Limited was an agent of the plaintiff at Vancouver, with authority to take risks and issue policies, although the practice had been that the policies in Vancouver were actually filled out by Horne, Taylor & Co., another agent of the plaintiff at Vancouver, and countersigned and issued by Burrard Agencies Limited. The National Canners Limited had its insurance placed through Burrard Agencies Limited with the plaintiff, which had re-insured with another company the excess over $37,500, which sum was the limit which the plaintiff wished itself to carry on the risk in question. About 6.15 o'clock on the evening of July 31, 1925, the secretary of the National Canners Limited, over the telephone, arranged with Burrard Agencies Limited, through its manager, Mr. Irving, to place an additional amount of $20,000 of insurance upon its stock in trade. Owing to the lateness of the hour, Mr. Irving made a note of the arrangement, leaving it until the following day to have the policy issued. That night the premises of the National Canners Limited were destroyed by fire. On the following day, Mr. Barnes, the manager of Rithet Consolidated Limited, came to Vancouver, made a full investigation, and decided that the plaintiff was liable and must pay the loss. Rithet Consolidated Limited, accordingly, on August 3, issued a policy dated July 31, covering the risk of $20,000. After adjustment, the loss under this policy was paid and of the amount so paid by the plaintiff it sought in this action to recover $12,812.87 from the defendant under an alleged contract of re-insurance.\nOn July 16, 1925, Mr. Barnes, manager of Rithet Consolidated Limited, spoke to Mr. Elderton, who conducted the defendant's head office for British Columbia at Vancouver, about giving the plaintiff \"a line of re-insurance\" as to the National Canners Limited, who, it was anticipated, might make applications for further insurance. On July 17, Rithet Consolidated Limited wrote the defendant as follows:\nNational Canners, Limited *** The writer spoke to Mr. Elderton about this line yesterday and he intimated that he would be quite willing to accept a reinsurance of the Queen on this risk and we should be glad if you would kindly look into the matter and let us know how much reinsurance you would accept on behalf of the Queen, which has at present $35,000 on the line.\nThis was replied to in a letter of July 20, as follows:\nRe National Canners *** I duly received your letter of the 17th inst. in reference to the plant of the above firm, and shall be glad to accept a line of $15,000 as reinsurance of the \"Queen.\" Will you kindly advise me when the Company is bound on the risk.\nAnd the last mentioned letter was replied to by a letter of July 23, as follows:\nNational Canners, Ltd.; We thank you for yours of the 20th inst. advising that you are in a position to accept a line of $15,000 as re-insurance of the Queen on the above risk.\nWe hope to be able to forward some commitments in the course of the next week or so.\nMr. Barnes then showed the correspondence to his insurance clerk, and instructed him that, as to any further insurance taken by the plaintiff from National Canners Limited, the first $15,000 so taken should be re-insured in the defendant company. The insurance clerk made a note in his block sheet to this effect and put a note upon his file.\nThe questions on the appeal before this Court were: (1) Whether there was a binding contract of insurance between the plaintiff and the National Canners Limited; and (2) If so, was there a binding contract of re-insurance between the plaintiff and the defendant.\nA. C. Heighington for the appellant.\nE. P. Davis K.C. and E. F. Newcombe for the respondent. At the conclusion of argument of counsel, the judgment of the court was orally delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014We are all of the opinion that the appeal cannot succeed.\nAs to the first branch of the appeal\u2014whether the Queen Insurance Company was committed to insure the National Canners\u2014there is really no room for argument against the proposition that there was a binding agreement. In the absence of fraud, which is now out of the case, it is perfectly clear there was a binding agreement.\nNo doubt there is more room for argument as to whether there was an effective contract of re-insurance. This depends largely on the construction of the letters. Putting it, as Mr. Heighington put it a few moments ago, that the letter of the British Traders Insurance Company's manager, Elderton, is of doubtful construction, the ambiguity must be resolved against him, because, if the letter was of such doubtful construction that Barnes might fairly infer from it that it gave him authority to re-insure, then the letter must be so construed against the Company. The case of Ireland v. Livingston[3], referred to by my brother Duff in the course of the argument, makes this clear. Barnes swears he did put that construction upon it, that he did consider himself thereby specially authorized to issue a policy of re-insurance or to enter into a contract of re-insurance; and his credibility is not now impugned. Having taken that stand, having had authority for it, the Elderton letter being reasonably susceptible of that construction, the company is undoubtedly bound by his act.\nUpon the question of re-insurance, we are of the opinion that there was a contract of re-insurance from the moment that the Queen Insurance Company placed the insurance on the National Canners' property.\nViewing the letters as amounting only to an offer by the appellant Company to undertake re-insurance, to the extent stipulated, of further risks to be assumed by the respondent Company, the principle of Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Company (1), cited by Mr. Davis, applies; performance of the condition completes the contract and notification of acceptance is, in such cases, dispensed with. Under the circumstances, the nature of the appellant's undertaking implies that its obligation was to arise immediately upon the respondent becoming committed to liability.\nUpon these grounds we would affirm the judgment below, and dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mayers, Lane & Thomson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: E.

Jones (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1927: October 5; 1927:October 6.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Newcombe, Rinfret and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nNegligence\u2014Motor vehicle\u2014Injury to passenger\u2014Autobus\u2014Defence of inevitable accident\u2014Knowledge of driver as to icy condition of street.\nThe appellant's motor \"bus\" was being driven down a steep incline on a frosty and foggy morning, the street being in an icy condition, when the driver saw that a street car had stopped in front of him. He tried to stop the \"bus\" and in order to avoid a collision ran it sharply to the right over the curb and sidewalk, struck a telephone pole and injured the respondent who was a passenger in the bus. The trial judge held that \" having regard to the conditions, the short range of visability, the fact that there was a street car line upon the road, and the condition of the pavement, as it was, or ought to have been known to the driver, the motor bus ought to have been and might have been kept under such control that it could have been stopped without doing any damage,\" and he gave judgment in favour of the respondent, which judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld that there was not sufficient evidence to support the finding of the trial judge. Under the circumstances of this case it cannot be reasonably said that the driver knew or ought to have known the icy condition of the pavement, as he had been faced with an unexpected situation such that, had it not existed, no difficulty would have been experienced in negotiating the hill.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1927] 2 W.W.R. 692) rev.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, D. A. McDonald J.[2], and maintaining the respondent's action for damages for personal injuries caused by negligence.\nThe material facts of the case, as stated by the trial judge and his findings on the evidence are the following:\n\"This is an action for damages for injuries suffered by a passenger proceeding from Port Moody to Vancouver in a motor bus operated by the defendant for hire.\n\"The decision of the case rests not I think upon the credibility of any of the witnesses, for I believe that all the witnesses told the truth, as best they could, but rather upon the inferences to be drawn from the evidence given. The motor bus in question, having earlier in the morning proceeded from Vancouver to Port Moody, was returning over the same route at about 9 'o'clock through a dense fog through which the range of visibility was from 40 to 50 feet. Having climbed a grade to the intersection of Slocan street with Hastings street the motor bus proceeded over the brow down a grade of 5.44 per cent toward Clinton street. When nearing Clinton street it was noticed by the driver that a street car had stopped immediately in front to take on passengers, and that a Ford truck had stopped behind the street car. The driver of the motor bus, in his effort to stop, lost control and, in order to avoid a collision, turned sharply to the right, mounted a 6-inch curb and brought his motor bus to rest with its left side against a telegraph post and its front against a store building. There seems no doubt that when the emergency arose the driver handled his car in the best possible manner. Immediately following the motor bus came the chief of police driven by his expert chauffeur, who also, on trying to bring his car to a stop, met with difficulties and skidded into the Ford truck driving it across the street. The chief of police ran back to flag any further cars coming down the hill with the result that the drivers of some eight or ten cars, suddenly faced with this alarming signal, lost control of their cars and skidded down the hill or across the street. The only car that came down the hill safely and rested behind the street car was the Ford truck.\n\"Admittedly the street, which consisted of a wooden block pavement, was in a very slippery and icy condition. The evidence goes to show that this condition was not observable to a driver, and it is suggested that this particular block was in worse condition than any other part of the road. It seems difficult to understand why this should be so.\n\"The driver says that he went down the hill in second gear at about ten or twelve miles an hour. In my opinion, on the whole of the evidence, the motor bus was proceeding at too great a rate of speed.\"\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and J. de G. Audette for the appellant.\nC. W. Craig K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the court was orally delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014There is no finding of fact in this case as to the rate of speed at which the defendant's omnibus was moving. There is a finding by the learned trial judge that it was travelling at an excessive speed, having regard to all the conditions\u2014short range of visibility, the fact that there was a tram car line upon the street, and (the crucial point), the condition of the pavement, which, in his opinion, was, or ought to have been, known to the driver. He makes no finding apart from that. The case really turns upon the question whether or not the icy condition was, or ought to have been, known to the driver. That it was not in fact known to him seems abundantly clear. We are also of opinion that it cannot be said that it ought to have been known to him. That the condition of the pavement was quite abnormal and not to be expected is shown by the evidence of half a dozen witnesses. The driver of the bus realized the existence of that icy condition only when he came to apply his brakes. It was then too late to avoid the accident because the wheels of the bus \"skidded\" on the icy surface of the road way.\nMr. Justice Galliher who dissented seems to us to have best realized what the situation was. He points out, what I have already alluded to, the learned trial judge's assumption that the driver ought to have known the condition of the highway. \"The main feature,\" he then goes on to say\nis, did the driver know, or should he have known, of the icy condition of the pavement? He had passed over the same pavement an hour or two before that same morning. Other witnesses had done the same and they all say that the condition of the pavement had undergone a marked change in the meantime not observable until they attempted to stop, and when we find that all but one of a number of cars that came over the brow of the hill at that time and attempted to stop, mixed up and got out of control, it would seem to indicate that no one expected to encounter the conditions they were met with. Under such circumstances can it reasonably be said that the driver knew, or ought to have known, the condition of the pavement? I think the driver was faced with an unexpected situation which, had it not existed, no difficulty would have been experienced in negotiating the hill, and it should not be held that he knew, or ought to have known, of the condition of the pavement.\nWith that statement, having regard to the evidence, I and I believe my learned brothers also, are fully in accord. In our opinion there is not sufficient evidence to support the finding of the learned trial judge. The appeal is allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal, and the action is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Walsh, McKim, Housser & Molson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: R.

C.C.P.\u2014R.S.Q. (1909) Arts. 5936, 5937, 7532, 7533.\nThe respondents brought a petition (quo warranto) to have the appellant\u2019s election as mayor of Quebec declared null, to remove him from that office, to disqualify him for municipal office for five years, to have him condemned to pay a fine of $400 to the Crown and to obtain an order for a new election. The joinder of these several claims was objected to by the appellant by way of a dilatory exception.\nHeld that, while the competence of an appeal from the disposition made of such an exception is doubtful, this court would in any event be loath to interfere with the judgment appealed from, as the propriety of the joinder is largely a question of practice and procedure; but, on the merits, this court is of opinion that there is nothing incompatible or contradictory in the several \u201ccauses of action\u201d preferred by the respondents.\nHeld, also, that the fact that the requirements of art. 980 C.C.P. (which were imposed by art. 988 C.C.P.) do not apply to a proceeding for a declaration of disqualification imposed by art. 5936 R.S.Q. (1909) does not preclude the joinder of the \u201ccause of action\u201d given by the latter article with a proceeding properly instituted under art. 987 C.C.P.\nHeld, further, that the prescription under arts. 7532, 7533 R.S.Q. (1909), invoked by the appellant has no application to a demand for disqualification based on arts. 5936, 5937 R.S.Q. (1909).\nHeld, further, that it is within the power of a provincial legislature to impose disqualification from municipal office as a consequence of the contravention of statutory prohibitions enacted by it to ensure the proper conduct of municipal affairs.

Act, s. 92).\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 43 K.B. 160) aff.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Gisborne J., and maintaining the respondents\u2019 petition for the issue of a writ of quo warranto against the appellant. The material facts of the case are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nL. St. Laurent K.C. for the appellant.\nL. G. Belley K.C. and S. Lapointe K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014Upon the several points discussed by Allard J. (whose judgment is concurred in by Greenshields and Howard JJ.), we find ourselves entirely in accord with the views which that learned judge has expressed. There is no room to doubt the right of the Superior Court to entertain a proceeding such as that instituted by the respondents. Each of the several claims presented by them was properly the subject of the jurisdiction of that court. The propriety of their joinder in one proceeding (art. 87 C.C.P.) is largely a question of practice and procedure. Objection to such joinder is properly the subject of a dilatory exception (art. 177 (6) C.C.P.). While the competence of an appeal from the disposition made of such an exception is, to say the least, probably doubtful, we should, in any event, be extremely loath to interfere with the determination by the provincial court of appeal that the joinder was properly made. In the present instance, however, we see no reason to doubt the soundness of the views that have prevailed. There appears to be nothing incompatible or contradictory in the several \u201ccauses of action\u201d preferred by the plaintiffs; they seek condemnations of a like nature; they are susceptible of the same mode of trial, i.e., by summary proceedings (arts. 1150 et seq. C.C.P.); and their joinder is not prohibited by any express provision. The fact that the requirements of art 980 C.C.P. (which were imposed by art. 988 C.C.P.) do not apply to a proceeding for a declaration of the disqualification imposed by art. 5936 R.S.Q. does not preclude the joinder of the \u201ccause of action\u201d given by the latter article with a proceeding properly instituted under art. 987 C.C.P.\nOn three points, two of them not expressly covered by the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Allard, we think it well to add a few words. The prescription under arts. 7532-3 R.S.Q. (1909), invoked by the appellant, has no application to a demand for disqualification based on arts. 5936-7 R.S.Q. (1909).\nIt is undoubtedly within the power of the provincial legislature to impose disqualification from municipal office as a consequence of the contravention of statutory prohibitions enacted by it to ensure the proper conduct of municipal affairs. \u201cMunicipal institutions within the province\u201d is one of the subjects of provincial jurisdiction enumerated in s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act. The right of a provincial legislature to prescribe appropriate penalties for disobedience to statutory prohibitions which it is within its power to enact has been time and again affirmed by this court and in the Judicial Committee.\nWhether the penalty of disqualification, when imposed, shall relate back so that the municipal officer shall be deemed not to have been duly elected where the offence has been committed during a previous term of office, or attaches only upon his being found guilty of the offence for which the penalty is imposed, is quite immaterial in the present case. The appellant merely ceased to hold office from the moment he was held disqualified. No penalties for his having acted as mayor prior to that date have been awarded against him. The suggestion, however, that there must be first a proceeding to determine the guilt of the accused and then a subsequent proceeding for the imposition of the penalty of disqualification savours so much of unnecessary circuity that it cannot be seriously entertained.\nFor these reasons we would dismiss the appeal, with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St. Laurent, Gagn\u00e9, Devlin & Taschereau.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Lapointe & Rochette.\n[1] (1926) Q.R. 43 K.B. 160.\n",

They had no title to the timber at the time it was destroyed by fire and there is no evidence that they were then in possession of the limit nor in such possession alleged.
