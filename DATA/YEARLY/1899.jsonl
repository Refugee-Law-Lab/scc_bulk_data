C.\nA bank borrowed from the Dominion Government two sums of $100,000 each, giving deposit receipts therefor respectively numbered 323 and 329. Having asked for a further loan of a like amount it was refused, but afterwards the loan was made on O., one of the directors of the bank, becoming personally responsible for repayment, and the receipt for such last loan was numbered 346. The Government having demanded payment of $50,000 on account that sum was transferred in the bank books to the general account of the Government, and a letter from the president to the Finance Department stated that this had been done, enclosed another receipt numbered 358 for $50,000 on special deposit, and concluded, \"Please return deposit receipt no. 323\u2014$100,000 now in your possession.\" Subsequently $50,000 more was paid and a return of receipt no. 358 requested. The bank having failed the Government took proceedings against O. on his guarantee for the last loan made to recover the balance after crediting said payments and dividends received. The defence to these proceedings was that it had been agreed between the bank and O. that any payments made on account of the borrowed money should be first applied to the guarantee loan and that the president had instructed the accountant so to apply the two sums of $50,000 paid, but he had omitted to do so. The trial judge gave effect to this objection and dismissed the information of the Crown.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court (6 Ex. C. R. 21), Taschereau and Girouard JJ. dissenting, that as the evidence showed that the president knew what the accountant had done and did not repudiate it, and as the act was for the benefit of the bank, the latter was bound by it; that the act of the Government in immediately returning the specific deposit receipts when the payments were made was a sufficient act of appropriation by the creditor within Art. 1160 C. C. no appropriation at all having been made by the debtor on the hypothesis of error; and if this were not so the bank could not now annul the imputation made by the accountant unless the Government could be restored to the position it would have been in if no imputation at all had been made which was impossible as the Government would then have had an option which could not now be exercised.\nAppeal from a judgment of The Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing an information by the Attorney General for Canada on behalf of the Crown against the defendant.\nThe material facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note, and more fully in the judgment of the majority of the court delivered by Mr. Justice King.\nFitzpatrick Q. C., Solicitor General for Canada, and Newcombe Q. C., Deputy of the Minister of Justice, for the Crown. No defence is suggested except alleged payment. Nothing has been paid by the respondent and the only sums paid by the bank since receipt of the deposit represented by number 323 are the two payments of $50,000 each and interest, and the dividend of 66f per cent upon the entire claim of the Government which was paid by the liquidators. The two sums were paid by the bank on 9th July, 1883, and 16th August, 1883, and those payments were appropriated by letters of the accountant, that with the first remittance requesting the return of deposit receipt no. 323, and the second expressly making the appropriation on deposit receipt no. 35 8. It was never suggested previous to this action that there was any error in making the appropriations, nor that the accountant of the bank in making the payments and appropriations was not acting within the scope of his authority. The evidence as to conversations between the respondent and his co-directors with regard to the payment of the deposit guaranteed by the respondent out of the first moneys available by the bank was properly objected to. It is res inter alios acta and cannot affect the rights of the Crown in these proceedings. As to the scope of the accountant's authority the effect of the evidence is that it was part of his ordinary duties to make and apply payments such as that in question, and that he wrote the letters in the ordinary course of business and, in view of the fact that he had conducted a considerable part of the correspondence with the Government, was acting within the apparent scope of his authority. Evidence that he had in fact in this case acted contrary to specific instructions would not be material for the purpose of limiting his authority as between the bank and the Crown to whom no notice of his special instructions had ever been given. Kershaw v. Kirkpatrick[2].\nThe mistake, if any, was made within the scope of his authority, for the benefit of the bank, which thereby received further credit and acted upon and took the benefit of the appropriation. The bank cannot therefore now alter the appropriation. Pollock on Contracts (4 ed) p. 531 et seq: Mackay v. Commercial Bank of New Brunswick[3]. The appropriation could only be changed by a rescission of the appropriation made by consent of all parties; Kershaw vs. Kirkpatrick (1); and any agreement between respondent and his co-directors as to the manner in which the appropriation was to be made or the intention of the bank, undisclosed to the Government, can have no effect in controlling the appropriation clearly made by the correspondence. Smith v. Hughes[4]; Tamplin v. James[5].\nThe dividend of 66 \u215c per cent was paid under orders of the court in respect of the aggregate claim of $237, 840.20, filed by the Government and cannot be applied on the guaranteed deposit receipt except pro rata. Thompson v. Hudson[6]; In re Accidental Death Ins. Co.[7]; De Colyar on Guarantees, (3 ed.) 458; Dixon v. Clark[8]; Martin v. Brecknell[9]; art 1160 C. C.\nThe bank had no right to appropriate its payment except at the time when the payment was made The Crown is content with the appropriation which the bank then made. If that appropriation be set aside the appropriation made by the Crown as creditor to receipt number 323 will stand. Devaynes v. Noble; Clayton's Case[10]; Tudor's Mercantile and Mercantile Law (3 ed.) p. 1 and notes at pp. 19, 21 et seq. In the absence of any appropriation by debtor or creditor the law would also appropriate to deposit receipt number 323 which was the earliest debt. Even if the guaranteed deposit might be considered the more onerous debt and imputation invoked according to the Civil Code of Quebec, art. 1161, that rule cannot apply in this case because the Crown's position has been changed and its rights prejudiced by the appropriation upon receipt no. 323 by the bank and, until the defence was filed in this action, upwards of twelve years afterwards, the Crown had no notice that the bank did not intend to stand by its appropriation. Meantime the bank had failed and its affairs had been wound up. If the imputation had been originally made upon the guaranteed account the Government would doubtless have pressed immediately for payment of the unsecured account. It is therefore now too late to set aside the appropriation for error and allow the law to appropriate to the disadvantage of the Crown. The law presumes prejudice in such cases. London and River Plate Bank v. Bank of Liverpool[11]. Finally the appropriation cannot be set aside or varied in this action to which the bank is not a party, nor after the bank, having been wound up, has ceased to exist.\nReference was also made to Williams v. Rawlinson[12], per Best C. J. at page 371; Harding v. Tifft[13], at page 464 to 466 as to undisclosed intention; Stone v. Seymour[14]; Robson v. McKoin[15]; Plomer v. Long[16]; Gordon v. Hobart[17]; Ex parte Whitworth[18]; Monger on Appropriation, p. 75 and cases there cited; Stamford Bank v. Benedict[19]; Shaw v. The Bank of Decatur[20], at page 713 where a summing up of the cases appears; and also to the remarks of Mr. Justice Story in United States v. Wardwtll[21].\nJ. S. Hall Q.C. and Hogg Q.C. for the respondent. The law of Quebec governs this case; the application of the bank was from Montreal, the deposit was made at Montreal and the repayment was to be made there. The performance, or payment, or fulfilment of the contract, either under the deposit receipt or defendant's letter, was to be at Montreal, and in matters of deposit it is the law of the place of fulfilment that governs. Dicey Conflict of Laws, 570; The Queen v. Doutre[22]; Brooks v. Clegg[23]. The $100,000 paid back by the bank must be imputed on the loan covered by the defendant's letter, art. 1161 C.C., in the absence of imputation, or if left to the operation of law, so as to discharge the debt actually payable which the debtor had at that time the greater interest in paying. The authorities are unanimous that a secured debt is such a debt. Therefore, the money paid back by the bank must go to the discharge of the $100,000 in connection with which defendant gave his letter. It must be presumed to have been within the knowledge of the Minister of Finance, the bank and the respondent, at the time the letter was given, that defendant was entitled to have the first money paid back credited to the $100,000 for which he gave the letter, and nothing could have been done to change or alter his legal position without defendant's knowledge or consent.\nThe three deposits virtually became one debt merged together without one part having any priority over the other. When the demand for payment of $50,000 was made all the deposits were due. The numbers of deposit receipts had no significance. They were numbered simply as a convenience to the bank and the deputy-minister evidently viewed it in this way for in his letter of the 7th July, 1883, asking for $50,000, and a new receipt, he adds, \"I will return you one of the receipts for $100,000 which we now hold.\" It, made no difference to the Government, and the surety was entitled to have the imputation made so as to discharge him. Doyle v. Gaudette[24]; Attorney General of Jamaica v. Manderson[25].\nThe agreement by the bank, that the first monies paid back should be on account of the last $100,000, followed the law. There was error and mistake in the accountant's letter, and he wrote not only without authority, but contrary to the instructions of the president of the bank. We invoke the error and ask the payment to be made as was intended. Arts, 991 and 1160 C. C.; Holland de Villargues vo., \"Imputation,\" no. 19 bis; \u00c6tna Ins. Co. v. Brodie[26]. The surety can urge the right of the debtor; he is the avant cause of the debtor and can also urge the error of the debtor. Art. 1958 C. C.; Fusier-Herman, Rep. vo. Cautionnement,\" nos. 433, 459.\nAs to the Crown's claim for interest it cannot be sustained. The defendant's letter in no way covers any interest. The construction of a contract of suretyship must be strictly in favour of him who contracts the obligation. Under any circumstances the deposit receipts only bore interest if thirty days' notice was given of their withdrawal, and, in any event, the bank's liability to pay interest ceased on its insolvency and the appointment of the liquidators, and in such cases the Crown is not a privileged creditor. Exchange Bank of Canada v. The Queen[27].\nThe claim of the Crown in this action has been discharged by the payments made by the liquidator of the Exchange Bank amounting in the course of the liquidation to $160,503.21, or 66f per cent. of the claim filed with the liquidator. As between the surety and the Crown this sum should be applied in the first place in payment of the amount guaranteed because it was, in fact, a payment by the debtor not specifically imputed by the Crown to any distinct portion of the debt, and if the guarantee remained outstanding and undischarged, it should now be imputed to discharge the debt so guaranteed under article 1161 of the code as being the debt in which the debtor had and has the greater interest in paying. Walton v. Dodds[28]; Doyle v. Gaudette[29]; Devaynes v. Noble; Clayton's Case[30]. Where no expressed declaration has been made, the intention is presumed most favourably to the debtor. In Young v. English[31] an intention to discharge the secured debt was presumed, and in the City Discount Company v. McLean[32] it was said that though the English rule falls short of that of the Roman law already mentioned, there is a tendency in the same direction arising from the disposition to impute an intention to a debtor to appropriate his payments upon the most onerous debt. Even under the English authorities, where one of the debts is guaranteed the creditor must allow the composition or dividend in reduction, and charge the surety only for the balance. Bardwell v. Lydall[33]; Gee v. Pack[34]. But here, under art. 11610. C. the dividend must be applied, in the absence of specific appropriation, upon the debt or portion of debt which the debtor has the greater interest in seeing paid.\nWe also rely upon the decisions in Paget v. Marshall[35]; Chinnock v. Ely[36]; Harris v. Pepperell[37].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I concur in the judgement of Mr. Justice King.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I agree with my brother Girouard that this appeal should be dismissed.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of my brother King that the appeal should be allowed.\nKING J.--This is an appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court (per Davidson J. pro hac vice) dismissing the claim of the Crown. The claim was based on a letter of respondent dated 11th May, 1883, guaranteeing a loan or deposit of $100,000 then being made to the Exchange Bank of Canada at the request of the respondent.\nThe Exchange Bank had its head office in Montreal. Its president was one Thomas Craig, and Mr. Ogilvie was one of the directors.\nIn April, 1883, the bank was in financial difficulty and applied to the Finance Department for a loan of $100,000. The loan was made on the 12th of the month by way of special deposit, at 5 per cent interest withdrawable on thirty days' notice. The deposit receipt given by the bank was numbered 323.\nFour days afterwards the bank made application for another $100,000, and on the 18th of April received this loan also, giving their deposit receipt for the amount. This deposit receipt was numbered 329, and is as follows:\nNo. 329.\n$100,000.00. Montreal, 17th April, 1883.\nThe Exchange Bank of Canada acknowledges having received from the Hon. the Receiver General the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, which sum will be repaid to the Hon. the Receiver General, or order, only on surrender of this certificate, and will bear interest at the rate of five per cent per annum, provided thirty days' notice be given of its withdrawal.\nThe bank reserves the privilege of calling in this certificate at any time on written notice to the depositor, after which notice all interest on the deposit will cease.\nIf when notice be given by the depositor of withdrawal, the bank elects to pay immediately, it shall have the right to do so.\n(Sd.) T. CRAIG,\nEntered. President.\n(Sd.) Ernest D. Wintle,\np. Accountant.\nThree days later the bank wrote the department that another $100,000 would be required to place them in an independent position, but the department declined to make such further loan.\nThen Mr. Ogilvie came to Ottawa and upon his undertaking to guarantee such further deposit, it was made on the 12th of May, 1883.\nThe letter of guarantee is as follows:\nOttawa, 11th May, 1883.\nMy Dear Sir,\u2014I beg that the Government will place a further sum of $100,000 at deposit with the Exchange Bank on the same terms as the former deposits of $200,000; and on the Government agreeing to comply with this request I hereby undertake to hold myself personally responsible for the further deposit of $100,000.\nYours very truly,\n(Sd.) A. W. OGILVIE,\nJ. M. Courtney, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of Finance, Ottawa.\nThe deposit receipt given in respect of this loan was numbered 346 and is as follows:\nNo 346.\n$100,000. Montreal, 12th May, 1883.\nThe Exchange Bank of Canada acknowledges having received from the Hon. the Receiver General the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, which sum will be repaid to the Hon. the Receiver General or order, only on surrender of this certificate, and will bear interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum, provided thirty days' notice be given of its withdrawal.\nIf when notice be given by the depositor of withdrawal, the bank elects to pay immediately, it shall have the right to do so.\n(Signed,) T. CRIAG.\nEntered, President.\n(Signed,) Ernest D. Wintle,\np. Accountant.\nOn the 31st of May, 1883, Mr. Courtney for the Finance Department wrote to the bank that \"on the 1st day of July next the Dominion Government will require the sum of $50,000 to be transferred from the special deposit account with your bank to the general account.\" In consequence of a letter from the bank of 29th June requesting that the repayment be postponed until after the 20th July, Mr. Courtney wrote on the 30th of June to the bank as follows:\nI am sorry to say that I must have the $50,000 turned into ordinary cash on Tuesday. I had intended to have drawn out immediately (i.e. after it had been transferred to general account) in order to meet payments on account of subsidies, but this I will do, I will only draw $5,000 a day for ten days. I may as well inform you that we shall want another $50,000 to be turned into cash on the 1st August.\nThe following further correspondence in reference to this payment then took place:\nMr. Courtney to the President (Managing Director.)\nOttawa, 7th July, 1883.\nSir,\u2014Referring to previous correspondence, I have now the honour to request that you will be good enough to forward to me at your earliest convenience a receipt for the $50,000 which was to be turned into cash on the 1st instant, and also a fresh receipt for $50,000 at interest, and will return you one of the receipts for $100,000 which we now hold. Pray attend to this without delay.\nJames M. Craig, pro. Manager to Mr. Courtney.\nMontreal, 9th July, 1883.\nAs requested in your letter of 7th instant I now forward the deposit receipt of this bank no. 358 in favour of the Hon. the Receiver General for $50,000, and enclose our receipt for $50,000 placed to the credit of the Finance Department account. Please return deposit receipt no. 323\u2014$100,000 now in your possession and oblige.\nMr. Courtney to the President of the bank:\nOttawa, 10th July, 1883.\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant enclosing special deposit receipt for $50,000, and I have now the honour to enclose herewith your deposit receipt no. 323 of the 13th April, 1883, for $100,000.\nJames M. Craig pro. Manager, to Mr. Courtney of 11th July, acknowledging receipt of deposit receipt no. 323.\nThen with respect to the withdrawal or repayment of the second $50,000, of which Mr. Courtney had given notice on 30th June for the 1st of August, there is the following correspondence:\nMr. Toller, acting Deputy Minister of Finance to the President of the Bank:\nJuly 31st, 1883.\nIn reply to your letter of yesterday's date asking that the $50,000 which is to be taken from interest to ordinary cash to-morrow should be allowed to remain until the 1st of September, I regret to say that I am unable to comply with your request, as my instructions from Mr. Courtney were that the money was to be paid on the day named by him.........\nPresident of Bank to Mr. Toller asking that Government will draw on the general account only at the rate of $10,000 every third day.\nToller to President of Bank, 15th August.\nAs I wrote to you the end of last month my instructions were to call upon you to place $50,000 (of which due notice has been given) at the credit of the Receiver General's ordinary cash from the amount now at interest. I do not see how I can consent to its remaining until the 1st of September. I shall, however, be most happy to comply with your request about drawing out the money. Please send us a receipt showing that the amount has been transferred from \"interest\" to current account with the accrued interest thereon.\nJames M. Craig, Pro. Manager, to Deputy Minister of Finance, 16th August, 1883.\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, and herewith enclose receipt showing the current account with the department credited $50,315.07. Please return deposit receipt No. 358\u2014$50,000, in favour of the Receiver General and oblige.\nThe bank suspended payment on the 17th of September, 1883, and on the 5th of December a winding-up order was issued under which the affairs of the bank have been fully wound up.\nThe Crown filed a claim for the amount of the two deposits as per receipts nos. 329 and 346, with interest thereon, and for the further sum of $37,840.24 in respect of other transactions and received in dividends a sum $160,503 21, or sixty-six and three-eighths per cent.\nThe principal question relates to the application of the two payments of $50,000 each.\nFor the Crown it is contended that they were made upon the first indebtedness evidenced by the special deposit receipt no. 323, and by the receipt no. 358 given in substitution for the one-half of such loan remaining unpaid after the payment of the first sum of $50,000.\nThe respondent contends that such alleged application is null and void for error and want of authority in the person making it, and that in such event by the law of Quebec (which is claimed to be applicable) the payments are to be applied to the discharge of the guaranteed debt, thereby relieving the debtor of his obligations at once to the creditor and to his surety.\nArts. 1160 and 1161 (in part) of the Civil Code are as follows:\n(1160.) When a debtor of several debts has accepted a receipt by which the creditor has imputed what he has received in discharge specially of one of the debts, the debtor cannot afterwards require the imputation to be made upon a different debt except upon grounds for which contracts may be avoided.\n(1161.) When the receipt makes no special imputation, the payment must be imputed in discharge of the debt actually payable which the debtor has at the time the greater interest in paying.\nIt may be noticed in passing that Art. 1160 seems to relate to cases where the creditor has made the imputation, and not to cases where the imputation has been made by the debtor.\nThe error assigned as sufficient under Art. 1160 to avoid the imputation of payment of the first loan or debt is briefly this:\nIt is said that in consequence of the bank having agreed with Mr. Ogilvie that the first moneys paid would be paid on account of the guaranteed debt, Thomas Craig, the Bank President, gave instructions to the accountant, James M. Craig, so to apply the two sums of $50,000, but that without the knowledge or consent of the bank he omitted to do so, but on the contrary purported to make the payments on account of the first of the loans. It is not suggested that the Government knew anything of these transactions or understandings between the bank and Mr. Ogilvie, or of the instructions to James M. Craig.\nThe learned Judge has upheld these contentions of the respondent, and has directed that the payments be applied to the discharge of the guaranteed indebtedness, and dismissed the information of the Crown.\nIt may for present purposes be assumed that the view taken in the court below as to the case being governed by the law of Quebec is correct.\nIt has not been contended that the guarantor's responsibility under the terms of his letter of guarantee would cease whenever the banks special deposit indebtedness to the Crown should become reduced to $200,000, the amount at which it then stood. If it had been so contended, it might have been replied that the guarantee was that of a particular debt then being about to be contracted, and referred to as \"the further deposit of $100,000.\" The several loans were distinguished by the respective deposit receipts or contracts entered into in respect of each, and which were not entirely similar in terms. The contract numbered 346 was that for the performance of which by the bank Mr. Ogilvie made himself responsible.\nThen as to error and want of authority on the part of James Craig in purporting to make the imputation of payment.\nThe act of an agent binding the principal needs to be not only within the scope of the authority, but for the employer's benefit. As to the last point first. The natural effect of Craig's imputation was to maintain the failing credit of the bank with its creditor, by preserving to the latter the personal security of Mr. Ogilvie, while at the same time the total liability was reduced. It was therefore clearly an act done by James Craig for the benefit of the bank under the circumstances in which it was placed.\nThen as to the scope of Craig's authority. It seems manifest from the testimony of the bank president that, in the condition in which the bank was, things were left to be done by the accountant acting for the manager which perhaps at other times might not have been left to him. Thomas Craig, the president, says:\nAt that time things were in a pretty bad shape and we did not know where we were standing, and instead of doing this myself as I ought to have done according to the agreement of the board (referring to the agreement with Mr. Ogilvie) by some means or other it was done by the accountant.\nThat is to say, owing to the confusion the president by some means or other left it to the accountant acting for him to transact this part of the bank's business. It further appears from the instructions said to have been given by the president to the accountant that the latter was recognized and treated as the officer charged with the signification of the imputation of payments.\nThroughout the correspondence, beginning with the forwarding of the first deposit receipt, James Craig acts at every stage of the transactions as on behalf of the president, and with his knowledge.\nIn the letter to the bank president of 10th July, 1888, Mr. Courtney referred to James Craig's letter of the day before and enclosed \"deposit receipt no. 323 of the 13th April.\"\nThere can be no reasonable question then that the president knew of what had been done, for the deposit receipt was referred to not only by its number but its date, and not only did he not repudiate it, but concluded the arrangement by making out fresh deposit receipt no. 358.\nSupposing however, that there was error, the annulment of the imputation by James Craig would still leave the act of the Crown in immediately sending back the deposit receipts as a sufficient act of appropriation on their part, no appropriation at all having been made by the bank on the hypothesis of error.\nAnd even if this were not so, the bank could not get a benefit from their own error, and annul the imputation made by Craig, unless the creditor could be put in the same position as he would have been if there had been no imputation at all by the bank, and for obvious reasons no option can now be exercised by the Crown. There was clear prejudice to the Crown in being deprived of an option that would have belonged to it if Craig's act had, on the instant of making it, been nullified.\nThere seems therefore, upon these several considerations, to be no satisfactory ground for treating the case as though there had been no appropriation of payment either by the bank or the Crown.\nIt is further suggested that the imputation was invalid because not made at the time of payment.\nWith regard to the first payment of $50,000, Craig's letter of 9th July advises that the amount has been placed to the credit of the Finance Department, i.e., to the credit of the general or current account, and simultaneously asks for return of deposit receipt no. 323. This was at once assented to by the Crown (whose assent may be considered necessary upon a part payment of the debt), and acted upon by the return of the receipt asked for. Craig's letter constitutes an immediate appropriation. If not, there was the appropriation instantly made by the Crown upon being notified of the fact of payment, or it was made by the joint assent to receiving part payment on account of such debt. In either way, therefore, there was valid application to the first debt.\nIf the actual payment of the money upon cheques drawn against general account be regarded, it must on principle be considered that the previous declarations and consents as to the application of the payments continued to operate so as to govern and explain the act of payment when it should take place, and to determine its character and quality.\nSo as to the second sum of $50,000, Craig's letter of 16th August advises of the transfer of the amount from the interest account to current account, and at the same time requests the return of deposit receipt no. 358. This also was acted upon and the deposit receipt returned. Until such return of the deposit receipt the transaction was incomplete.\nAgain, regarding the payments as not made until payment of the cheques drawn against general account, such subsequent payments would in the way already mentioned be considered as being made in pursuance of the subsisting declaration of intention and consent.\nAs to the dividends received by the Crown in the winding-up, the debts being distinct, the surety is entitled to have a ratable amount applied towards the reduction of the guaranteed debt.\nAs to interest, the respondent in his letter of 11th of May requested that the further deposit of $100,000 be made on the same terms as the former deposits of $200,000, and these terms included payment of interest by the bank at 5 per cent; the obligation to be responsible for the deposit therefore reasonably includes interest at the named rate.\nThe result, therefore, is that the appeal is to be allowed with costs here and below, and judgment to be entered for the Crown for the amount of the deposit with interest at 5 per cent, deducting a ratable amount of the dividends received by the Crown upon the winding-up of the bank.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting.)\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada (Davidson J. ad hoc), which dismissed the information of the Attorney General of Canada, praying for judgment against the respondent for $77,337.03, as balance due under a letter signed by him on the 11th of May, 1883, and purporting to guarantee the last of three loans for $100,000 each, made by the Government of Canada to the late Exchange Bank of Canada. The bank failed on the 17th of September, 1883, and went into liquidation on the 5th of December of the same year. In 1892, its affairs were wound up in insolvency, the liquidators discharged and all the books and papers (except a few which were deposited in court) ordered to be destroyed. The information of the Attorney General was fyled on the 17th of September, 1895, and the trial took place in Montreal on the 21st of July, 1897. So the Government had been silent at least twelve years after the debt had been created and exigible, and three years after the affairs of the bank had been finally liquidated in insolvency, and their books, papers and vouchers burnt by order of court. The respondent had no reason to object to this destruction, as nothing had been said or done by the Government about their claim against him, either in the insolvency proceedings or elsewhere. The respondent not only lost what would have proved to be valuable written evidence, but the living witnesses also disappeared. Nearly the whole board of directors died. The Government knew that any attempt to collect from the respondent would be resisted as they were informed by Mr. Thomas Craig, President of the bank, as early as November, 1883, that his letter of guarantee was considered as paid, without,' however, alleging any error in the imputation; apparently he was not aware of it at the time, nor for years after, till the institution of the present suit, when the papers were produced by the Crown. The Department of Justice, to whom the matter was referred in 1883, advised the Department of Finance that the respondent was still liable. This opinion was only communicated to the bank then in insolvency, and not to the respondent who was never asked to pay, even verbally, although no doubt in frequent contact with the Crown representatives, as a member of the Senate. As the respondent says, referring to the period of time posterior to the delivery of the letter of guarantee: \"I never had anything to do with the Government good, bad or indifferent; never heard of the debt; they never asked me for it for 14 years.\" Under the circumstances he naturally supposed that the Department of Finance had concluded that their claim was discharged by payment, if not by prescription. He says in his evidence:\nWitness: I said, I asked if he (T. Craig) had paid back that $ 100,000 and he said he hadn't.\nQ. When was this?\u2014A. I suppose six or seven weeks afterwards or four or five weeks (after the letter of guarantee was given.) I asked him repeatedly, and he told me at last that he had paid back the $100,000 and I asked him where my letter was.\nQ. Then what was his answer?\u2014A. He told me that he would have my letter in a very few days, that he had written asking for it.\nThe letter was never remitted and remained in the possession of the Finance Department for at least twelve years before they thought of collecting it; and after that long silence, which would be fatal to an ordinary creditor, he is called up to answer the demand of the Crown for a very large balance alleged to have remained unpaid, after deduction of the dividends received in insolvency and amounting to sixty-six and three-eighths per cent. The case, therefore, affords a most remarkable illustration of the great hardship of the law, prevailing at least in the Province of Quebec, which allows the Crown to plead prescription against a subject, just as any individual can, but refuses the subject every plea of prescription against the Crown, even in commercial matters, except prescription of thirty years. Arts. 2211, 2215 C. C. We do not, however, sit here to reform the law, but to interpret and apply the same. The defendant has invoked prescription. The trial judge observes that the plea of prescription was not seriously argued at the trial, and finally holds, and correctly so, that prescription had not injured. The law is clearly against the respondent, but equity evidently is with him.\nThe respondent has also pleaded payment by the bank and, in connection with this, has raised delicate questions of imputation of payment, which were decided in his favour by the court below. In order to have an intelligent understanding of this decision, it is necessary, first, to recapitulate the facts.\nOn the 13th of April, 1883, the Government of Canada, which was already in current account with the Exchange Bank of Canada, then in financial difficulties, and with a view of coming to its assistance, advanced them $100,000, for which the bank issued a special deposit receipt, no. 323. That paper is not produced and was likely destroyed. Four days later, on the 17th April, the Government deposited a further sum of $100,000 and received a second special deposit receipt, no. 329, which is produced.\nOn the 12th May following, the Government made a third advance of $100,000, and got a third deposit receipt, no. 346, which is also fyled; but this time the guarantee of the respondent was demanded and granted in these terms:\nOttawa, 11th May, 1883.\nMy Dear Sir,\u2014I beg that the Government will place a further sum of $100,000 at deposit with the Exchange Bank, on the same terms as the former deposits of $200,000; and on the Government agreeing to comply with this request, I hereby undertake to hold myself personally responsible for the further deposit of $100,000.\nYours very truly,\nA. W. OGILVIE.\nJ. M. Courtney,\nDeputy Minister of Finance.\nAll the deposit receipts are signed by the accountant and the president of the bank, T. Craig. They are of the same form and tenor, and read as follows:\nNo. 329,\nMontreal, 17th April, 1883,\n$100,000.00.\nThe Exchange Bank of Canada acknowledges having received from the Hon. the Receiver General the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, which sum will be repaid to the Hon. the Receiver General or order, only on surrender of this certificate, and will bear interest at the rate of five per cent per annum, provided thirty days' notice be given of its withdrawal.\nThe bank reserves the privilege of calling in this certificate at any time on written notice to the depositor, after which notice all interest on the deposit will cease.\nIf when notice be given by the depositor of withdrawal, the bank elects to pay immediately, it shall have the right to do so.\nT. CRAIG,\nEntered. President.\nErnest D. Wintle,\np. Accountant. Receipt 346 does not contain the second paragraph, \"The bank reserves, etc.\"\nIt is admitted that the respondent gave his letter of guarantee without having any understanding with the Government as to its future payment and discharge; but it is proved that he had gone to interview the Government at the bank's request; that he negotiated this third advance on consenting to become surety; that the Government cheque was remitted to him; and that finally upon his return to the head office of the bank in Montreal, he reported to the president and the directors what had taken place and informed them that he would not part with the cheque, unless they promised that the first money paid back would be applied to the loan he had so guaranteed, which request was immediately agreed to; and that upon this understanding the cheque was delivered to the bank, and deposit receipt no. 346 was issued. So says the respondent, and also Mr. Craig, the president, who adds that he personally undertook to see that the agreement would be carried out. Their testimony is not contradicted, although the appellant had ample opportunity to do so, if possible, by examining Mr. James M. Craig the accountant, or Mr. E. K. Greene, the only surviving director (with the respondent and Mr. Thomas Craig), at the time of the trial. Mr. Craig believes that an entry of the agreement was made in the minute book of the board of directors, but speaking after that length of time, he could not say positively. It is not even possible to verify the correctness of his impression, as the minute book is not produced and was probably destroyed with the other papers. In the whole of this transaction the respondent did not make one farthing of profit, and acted generously to assist the bank, of which he was a director and shareholder, and it is unfortunate for him that before giving the cheque he did not exact a written agreement and transmit the same to the Government.\nTwo payments of $50,000 each, it is alleged, were made in July and August, 1883. The three loans were payable on demand, the notice of thirty days being only required to save the interest. The payments were, however, only partial, and the creditor was not obliged to receive them; but not only did he accept the same, but he invited, in fact forced, the debtor to make them without even suggesting any imputation. On the 31st May, 1883, some three weeks after the respondent gave his letter of guarantee, the bank was informed by letter that \"on the first day of July next, the Dominion Government will require the sum of $50,000 to be transferred from the special deposit account with your bank to the general account.\" On the 30th of June, Mr. Courtney notified the bank \"that we shall want another $50,000 to be turned into cash on the 1st August.\" No reference is made to any particular loan.\nFinally, on the 7th July, when Mr. Courtney, who had not yet drawn upon any money transferred to the current account in payment of the first $50,000 call, proposed to the bank a modification of the arrangement, which was finally accepted and carried out, he does not state that the money paid, or to be paid, will be imputed upon the first loan, but that he \"will return one of the receipts for $100,000 which we now hold.\" It is therefore clear that the Government did not intend to make any special imputation of payment as a condition of the partial payment. The information of the Attorney General alleges that the imputation was made by the bank and agreed to by the Government and that is exactly what took place. It is proved that this imputation was done by the bank, acting not by its president, Mr. Thomas Craig, but by Mr. James M. Craig, its accountant, without authority, by error and contrary to his instructions. The evidence is clear upon this point. Mr. Thomas Craig, in his examination under a commission, as he was then carrying on business in the city of Brooklyn, N. Y., says:\nQ. Mr. Ogilvie held this check or document and refused to hand it over until he was personally guaranteed by the directors to protect him against the guarantee which he had given to the Government; what took place? A. The directors agreed to give him that guarantee and it was not reduced to writing, but simply, as far as I can recollect, on the minute book of the bank. I cannot recollect whether it was placed in the minutes or not, but there is no question but they agreed to do it.\nQ. Anything else? The understanding being that the first money that the bank repaid to the Government should release that guarantee, when it reached the amount of \u00a7100,000.\nQ. Do I understand that he refused to do it until this guarantee was given, and the assurance made that the first money paid back should go against this last \u00a7100,000? A. Yes..........\nQ. In connection with these two payments of fifty thousand dollars each, do you remember what instructions you gave to James N. Craig? (Objected to as illegal. Objection reserved by consent of parties). A. To the best of my recollection, he was instructed to apply this on the last loan\u2014these two payments.\nQ. By the last loan you mean the last sum of one hundred thousand dollars deposited by the Government, for which Mr. Ogilvie gave his letter of guarantee? A. Yes.\nQ. I understand you to say that the correspondence, in connection with these matters, was intrusted to you as the officer of the bank? A. Yes. I should have carried on the whole correspondence.\nQ. Then these two letters, written by Mr. James M. Craig, in connection with the return of the deposit receipts, were not authorized by the bank? A. No. Not especially authorized by the bank. He did it as a matter of routine, against my instructions.\nIn cross-examination he says:\nQ. Will you please look at the correspondence contained in Exhibit \"A\" and tell me the number of the receipt issued for the first loan of one hundred thousand dollars? A. The number in 323. Q. When the first fifty thousand dollars was paid back, the accountant of the bank asked for the return of that deposit receipt? A. Yes, but he asked that through error.\nQ. But it was returned? A. It was..........\nQ. You do not pretend to say that you gave positive instructions to your accountant not to apply that first $50,000 in payment of the first loan? A. His instructions were to apply those $50,000 on account of the last loan.\nQ. Did you give him those instructions yourself? A. Yes. I remember perfectly well.\nQ. You never notified the Government at any time, in any correspondence, that the first $50,000 paid back had been wrongly applied? A. No.\nQ. Nor notified the Government when the second $50,000 were paid, what the application should be? A. But the accountant was instructed to apply it in that way.\nRe-examination by Mr. Hall, on behalf of defendant.\nQ. You say in your cross-examination that the Government were not notified in any way about there being an error in the application of these two sums of fifty thousand dollars each. I suppose you mean no notice was sent prior to the letter of the 10th and 19th of November 1883? A. Yes, when I asked to get the return of the letter of May 11th, 1883, that was given by the defendant, Mr. Ogilvie, to the Government.\nThis statement, so far as it relates to the agreement with the bank, is corroborated by the respondent, who was examined on his own behalf. The reply of Mr. Thomas Craig to the request of the respondent to get back the letter of guarantee and also the two letters of Mr. Craig written in November and October, 1883, demanding the surrender of the letter as being paid, confirm his statement under oath made fourteen years afterwards that he instructed his accountant, James M. Craig, to apply the two payments to the last loan.\nThe trial judge maintained the plea of error and I agree with him that it is well founded, not only in fact, not also in law.\nThe appropriation of payment was suggested by the bank, but it was agreed to and carried out by the Government and may fairly be considered as one made by the creditor within the meaning of article 1160 of the civil code. The enactment of this article, moreover, is not limited to the case where the debtor has omitted to make an imputation, but provides generally for the case where the debtor has accepted a receipt in which the creditor has imputed, as was done in this instance by returning receipt no. 323, as requested.\nIt must be noticed that in this respect, the Quebec civil code is much broader than the Code Napoleon, Our own code, art. 1160, says:\nWhen a debtor of several debts has accepted a receipt by which the creditor has imputed what he has received in discharge specially of one of the debts, the debtor cannot afterwards require the imputation to be made upon a different debt, except upon grounds for which contracts may be avoided.\nThe Code Napoleon, art. 1255, limits the remedy of the debtor to \"dot ou surprise de la part du cr\u00e9ancier.\" The Louisiana code; art. 2161, has reproduced the latter. Error is not mentioned. Error, however, is a cause of nullity of contract, whether common to all the contracting parties or personal to one of them only, and can be proved by verbal testimony; arts. 991, 992, 1000 C. C. It can be invoked at any time before thirty years' prescription is acquired under art. 2242 C. C, different from art. 1204 of the C. N. which allows only ten years from the date of its discovery.\nThe appropriation of payment, made in this case, can therefore be attacked at the present time by the debtor for any of the causes for which he may impeach any contract he has made or assented to. The surety is in the rights of the debtor and it is an elementary principle that he can oppose all the exceptions which are not purely personal to him. Arts. 1031, 1958 C. C.\nWhat are the legal consequences of this error? The principles which govern matters of error have been recently laid down by this court in Delorme v. Cusson,[38], and it is sufficient to refer to what we said in that case. The imputation made by James M. Craig, in the name of the bank, although accepted and carried out by the Government in good faith, must be set aside, not only because it was unauthorized, but also because, even if authorized, it was made by error. The parties must be placed in the same position they were before the mistake or error was made. True, if any damage has thereby been suffered by the Government, the debtor, or in this case the surety, must indemnify them. But the Government has not pleaded any; none has been shown; the very opposite is proved. The first deposit receipt no. 323 has been returned, it is true, but it was a mere acknowledgement of debt which was never denied by any one, and if disputed could be otherwise proved. The Government continued to hold its equivalent in value, deposit receipt no. 346, for all the special deposit receipts were of like commercial value. They were collected on the estate of the bank without any question as to the amount. By timely notification on the part of the bank, they would have irrevocably lost their recourse against the surety. They had no control over that. The bank alone first could tell whether Mr. Ogilvie would be discharged or not. It was the privilege of the bank, free from any interference or action of the Government who could do nothing, except if the bank had been inactive. Without the error committed by the accountant of the bank, how could the Government reasonably expect to save the guarantee of the respondent? The Finance Department had so little hope of this result that when, on the 7th of July, they proposed to receive $100,000 in two payments, they did not say: We will keep deposit receipt no. 346, but, \"we will return you one of the receipts for $100,000 which we now hold,\" meaning any receipt you indicate. Under these circumstances the imputation should be set aside as having been made by error.\nWhat is the position of the surety in such a case? No conventional imputation was made, and therefore he is discharged by operation of law, the debtor having more interest to pay the last loan than the first or second, because he frees himself of two creditors and relieves his friend at the same time. It may also be said that the third loan is the most onerous, as it is due by two debtors. Such is the meaning of Art. 1161 of the Civil Code, similar to Art. 1256 of the French Code, as laid down by a well settled jurisprudence both in Quebec and in France. Brooks v. Clegg[39]; Boyle v.

Jur. Gen. 1893, 2, 425, notes 5 to 7; 2 Molitor, 986.\nLet us suppose that no error has been committed by the bank in making the imputation; is the respondent yet liable? The issue presents another feature which has been merely alluded to by the learned trial judge, without drawing any conclusion applicable to the case, namely: Was the imputation made at the very moment of the payment or payments? The learned judge, taking the view he did of the plea of error, no doubt considered that it was not necessary to examine this point of fact, although he lays down the rule of law that any appropriation of payment, whether by the debtor or the creditor, must be made at the instant of payment, and he quotes arts. 1158 and 1160 of the Civil Code and also Rolland de Villargues, vo. Imputation, p. 169; he finally draws the attention to the difference that exists between the English and the Civil law; for our Code as well as the French Code have merely reproduced the Civil law.\nThus, (he concludes), both English and Civil law give the option in the first place to the debtor, but he must opiate at time of payment. The like restriction as to immediate option in the event of the creditor coming to exercise his secondary right is preserved by us, but overthrown by comparatively recent decisions in England, The courts there, perhaps giving expression to long continued usage, have reversed the original principle of decision, enabled the creditor to make his election even up to time of trial, and in the absence of express appropriation, determined that it is his, and not, as with us, the debtor's, presumed intention which is to govern.\nSee also notes to Clayton's case in Tudor's leading cases.\nThe civil law, which must govern this case, is undoubtedly as stated by the learned judge. Art. 1158 C. C. says:\nA debtor of several debts has the right of declaring when he pays what debt he means to discharge.\nArt. 1160:\nWhen a debtor of several debts has accepted a receipt by which a creditor has imputed what he has received in discharge specially of one of the debts, the debtor cannot afterwards require the imputation. to be made upon a different debt except upon grounds for which contracts may be avoided.\nThe jurisprudence seems to be well settled that the imputation by the creditor, as well as that by the debtor, must be made at the very instant of payment, and that likewise the receipt mentioned in art. 1160 must be given, or supposed to be given, at that very time, and in accordance with the facts then existing. No doubt the creditor and debtor could agree, before or after, as to the imputation, but it cannot be so made to the detriment of third parties.\nToullier, vol. 7, n. 176:\nSi le d\u00e9biteur ne fait pas l'imputation, le cr\u00e9ancier a le droit de la faire, pour vu que ce soit a l'instant m\u00eame du paiement, et dans la quittance.\nLarombi\u00e8re, art. 1255, n. 2:\nD'autre part, le cr\u00e9ancier doit le faire \u00e0 l'instant m\u00eame du paiement.\nAubry et Eau, vol. 4, no. 320:\nLorsque le d\u00e9biteur ne d\u00e9clare pas qu'elle est l'obligation qu'il entend acquitter, l'imputation faite par le cr\u00e9ancier, au moment o\u00f9 il re\u00e7oit le paiement, doit obtenir son effect.\nLaurent, vol. 17, n. 611:\nPothier dit que si le d\u00e9biteur, en payant, ne faite pas d'imputation, le cr\u00e9ancier \u00e0 qui il est d\u00fb pour diff\u00e9rentes causes peut la faire par la quittance qu'il lui donne. L'article 1255 (1160 of the Quebec code) consacre implicitement ce droit.\nPothier y met deux conditions. Il faut d'abord que l'imputation ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans Pinstant. L'article 1255 ne reproduit pas cette condition, mais elle r\u00e9sulte de la nature m\u00eame du paiement. Imputer, c'est payer; donc l'imputation doit se faire lors du payement soit par le d\u00e9bitur, soit par le cr\u00e9ancier.\nBaudry-Lacantinerie, vol. 3, p. 761, 5th ed:\nLe cr\u00e9ancier doit faire cette imputation au moment m\u00eame du paiement; apr\u00e8s il serait trop tard, car il se trouverait en pr\u00e9sence d'une imputation faite par la loi, et il n'aurait pas le droit de la modifier.\nAt no. 1058, he mentions the case of an imputation agreed to by both the creditor and the debtor; he holds this imputation valid, but it must be made at the time of payment:\nCette imputation, effectu\u00e9e au moment du paiement, devrait \u00eatre respect\u00e9e alors m\u00eame qu'elle causerait pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 des tiers.\nHe quotes in this sense an arr\u00eat of Grenoble, 25th of June, 1892, D. 93, 2. 425. See also Pandectes Fran\u00e7aises, R\u00e9p. Alph. vo. Obl. n. n. 3484, 3489; Bloodworth v. Jacobs[41]; Adams v. Bank of Louisiana[42]. In Bloodworth v. Jacobs (1), Eustis C. J., of the Court of Appeals of Louisiana, said:\nThe rules concerning the imputation of payments were laid down with such admirable clearness and precision in the Roman law that they have undergone very little change since, and the learned counsel who argued this case concur in their exposition of them.\nThe debtor has first the right to make the imputation; if he does not exercise this right, it then appertains to the creditor; if neither makes the imputation, the law makes it for them; and in all cases the imputation takes place in one of these modes at the time payment is made, it being understood that where the imputation is made by the creditor, the debtor is always protected against surprise as well as against fraud.\nAfter the debtor shall have accepted & receipt in which the imputation is made by the creditor to any particular debt, it becomes irrevocable, unless there has been surprise or fraud on the part of the creditor.\nBut can the debtor and creditor agree in advance but after the creation of all the debts, that any future payment shall be applied to any particular debt, to the detriment of the surety who has not been consulted, although he has an eventual right of being discharged? I have not been able to find, in France or Quebec, any decision or opinion of the commentators in point, although the general principle is laid down that the creditor or debtor or both cannot interfere with the rights of third parties. Pand. Fr. R\u00e9p. Alph. vo. Obl. n. 3512. Of course, the authorities admit the legality of an imputation agreed to in advance by all the interested parties, including the surety; Caen, 17th April, 1869; D. 71, 2, 184; 17 Laurent, 613; 28 Demolombe, 62; Pandectes Fran\u00e7aises, vo. Ob., n. 3591; and a decision is quoted to the effect that an imputation made on a subsequent transaction, at the very time it was closed, would also bind the surety, although not consulted. But, if the imputation be settled only by the creditor and debtor on past transactions, no one has ventured to define the position of the surety, not assenting or even consulted. I cannot see how an agreement of that kind can have any effect in so far as he is concerned. Contracts have effect only between the contracting parties and cannot affect third parties, except in the cases specially provided by law. C. C. 1023, 1028. Articles 1158 and 1160 authorize imputations of payment by the debtor or creditor or both, provided they are made at the moment of payment. Therefore they cannot be made at any other time, and if not so made would not be binding upon third parties. Of course, an imputation made at the time of payment, as previously agreed to, would bind the surety, not in consequence of the agreement, but of the imputation being made at the time fixed by law. But this is not what took place in the present case.\nThe information of the Attorney General alleges, par. 5, that:\nOn the 9th day of July, 1883, the said Exchange Bank paid to Her Majesty the sum of $50,000 on account of the first advance or loan above mentioned, and at the same time delivered to Her Majesty a deposit receipt No. 358 to cover the $50,000 remaining on deposit of such first loan, and Her Majesty, at the request of the said bank, returned the deposit receipt numbered 323, which had been issued by the said bank to the Government for the said first advance or loan of $100,000.\n6. That on the 16th day of August, 1883, the said bank repaid to Her Majesty the remaining $50,000 of the first advance or loan, and Her Majesty, at the request of the said bank, returned to the said bank the deposit receipt No. 358, which had been received in respect of the said balance, as mentioned in the last preceding paragraph hereof.\nThe respondent, in his pleas, does not allege any particular day of payment; he simply says that the $100,000 were paid by the bank \"prior to its going into liquidation, and should be, and defendant claims, must be imputed and paid in payment of said last deposit.\"\nIn the course of the argument which was presented to this court, the parties seem to have overlooked the time the appropriation of payment was made. In my humble opinion this point cannot be ignored or dismissed, simply because it was not taken up at the hearing. It is clearly raised by the issue, and fully covered by the evidence, and I consider that the respondent is entitled to the benefit of the same. As I understand the case, it was the duty of the appellant to prove the allegation contained in his information that the imputation had been made by the Government at the request of the bank, and on the 9th of July and 16th of August, respectively. Has the appellant made that proof? What are the real facts? Mr. Dickieson, the bookkeeper of the Department of Finance, says that the money was\npaid back by a transfer from the deposit to the ordinary cash account and we chequed against that.\nQ. And then you got the whole of the amount?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And that explains the terms of those two receipts exhibits 5 and 4?\u2014A. Yes.\nMr. Newcombe: And the other $50,000 paid in the same way?\u2014A. Exactly in the same way. I was going to say that the bank did not give us a cheque for the $50,000, but they transferred to our credit in the current account $50,000 twice, and sent us a receipt.\nWe have here the proof that the whole $100,000 were actually paid by the bank; but Mr. Dickieson does not say precisely when they were so paid; neither does he state whether the money was checked out in two payments of $50,000 or in parts of $5,000 or $10,000 extending over several days, as Mr. Courtney had agreed to do. The cheques of the Government are not produced; they were likely never retired from the bank, and shared the fate of the other papers.\nThe books of the Government show conclusively that the two payments were made on the 10th of July and 17th of August, and not on the first loan but on the three loans generally, without any special imputation. The receipt no. 358 is not even charged. The Government account is as follows:\nExhibit C.\nExchange Bank, Montreal.\n(Special Account.)\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\n[Page\nThis statement prim\u00e2 facie at least makes proof against the Crown; C. C. 1222; Darling v. Brown[43]. It shows that no special appropriation was made and that, in consequence, the respondent was discharged by mere operation of law. No error is alleged and none is proved. No explanation is even offered. The burden of proof lies upon the appellant to show that the facts relating to the payments establish a different case.\nSpeaking from memory, Mr. Craig swears that the payments were made \"at the date or about the date he (Mr. Courtney) requested.\" He adds: By the correspondence, it seems that by letter of the 9th of July that fifty thousand dollars was sent to him and a new deposit receipt for fifty thousand dollars sent, with request to return the old one.\nThe fact is that, outside the Government books, the only available evidence is to be found in the correspondence between the bank and the Department of Finance, whether carried on by mail or otherwise, does not appear, but, from its perusal, we may infer that it was by mail, which would require one intervening day at least for transmission and reply. It is far from being satisfactory; it is not supplemented, nor explained by any verbal testimony. As it is, it must be accepted in its entirety and not in pieces; and, in my humble opinion, it does not support the contention of the Crown.\nOn the 31st of May the bank was informed by letter\nthat on the first day of July next, the Dominion Government will require the sum of $50,000 to be transferred from the special deposit account with your bank to the general account.\nOn the 29th of June Mr. T. Craig wrote: \"I shall be greatly obliged if you will postpone it until after the 20th,\" meaning, of July.\nOn the 30th June, Mr. Courtney replies;\nI must have the $50,000 turned into cash on Tuesday (which the calendar for 1883 indicates to have been the 5th July), but I will only draw $5,000 a day for ten days. I may as well inform you that we shall want another $50,000 to be turned into cash on the 1st August.\nOn the 4th of July, Mr. Courtney writes about the payment of interest, and adds in a P. S.:\nI have not turned into cash yet the $50,000 of which notice was given,\nmeaning, if I understand him rightly, that he had not yet commenced to draw against the general account, and in face of his letter of the 30th of June, he could not have done so. The natural inference of this P. S. was, however, that the money was in the bank to the credit and at the disposal of the Government, to be withdrawn as agreed to.\nOn the 7th July, Mr. Courtney proposed a modification to the arrangement, but without altering his promise to draw only at the rate of $5,000 per day.\nReferring, he said, to previous correspondence, I have now the honour to request that you will be good enough to forward to me at your very earliest convenience, a receipt for the $50,000, which was to be turned into cash on the 1st instant, and also a fresh receipt for $50,000 at interest, and will return you one of the receipts for $100,000 which we now hold. Pray attend to this without delay.\nOn the 9th of July, James M. Craig answers:\nAs requested in your letter of the 7th instant, I now forward the deposit receipt of this bank, No. 358, in favour of the Hon. Receiver General for $50,000, and enclose our receipt for $50,000 placed to the credit of the Finance Department account. Please return deposit receipt No. 323, $100,000, now in your possession and oblige.\nOn the 10th July Mr. Courtney replies:\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing special deposit receipt for $50,000, and I have now the honour to enclose herewith your deposit receipt No. 323 of the 13th April, 1883, for $100,000.\nThe ordinary receipt for $50,000 \"placed to the credit of the Finance Department account\" has been produced by the Crown as exhibit No. 4. It is antedated 1st July, 1883, and shows upon its face that the money had been so \"placed\" on that day, and in this particular it agrees with the facts and circumstances as they appear from the record. It reads as follows:\nExhibit No. 4.\nMontreal, July 1st, 1883.\nMemorandum Form to\nExchange Bank of Canada,\nMontreal.\nReceived from the Hon. the Receiver General for credit of current account with the Finance Department, fifty thousand dollars, being one-half of deposit receipt No. 323, dated 13th April, 1883, for $100,000 standing in the name of the Hon. the Receiver General.\nPlease reply on this slip. JAMES M. CRAIG.\n4,000-4-8-77. For President. This document and the evidence establish that the imputation was suggested long after the first so called payment was made, and that no money actually reached the Government on the 9th of July or previously or even on the 10th, although at its disposal since the first. It was not a payment in specie or its equivalent, or even the delivery of an accepted cheque of the bank or of another bank, but a mere exchange of receipts or credits of the same nature and effect,\u2014a mere substitution of the form of the debt\u2014a different acknowledgement of the same, in words only, but not in substance almost a mere matter of bookkeeping, the actual debit and credit remaining the same. Before this exchange of receipts or credits, the Government could collect at any time, on demand, but then without interest; and after the exchange, the position was the same. In both cases they were simple creditors, first as a special depositor and last as an ordinary one. The liability of the bank was not paid or discharged, but on the contrary continued the same. The operation was so far from being a payment\u2014that is a mode of extinguishing the debt, as contemplated by article 1138 of the Civil Code\u2014that if the bank had failed on the 9th, 10th or 11th of July, or any other subsequent day, but before the full withdrawing of the whole $50,000, the Government would have been a simple creditor as before, for any amount not withdrawn.\nTo sum up, these documents establish that at the time of the first payment, two receipts were substituted for receipt no. 323, namely a special one for $50,000, no. 358 (not produced), which was a renewal in part of no. 323, and an ordinary one, dated the 1st of July (exhibit no. 4) for $50,000 standing to the credit of the Government in the current account, to be drawn at the rate of $5,000 a day. Therefore no money was actually paid on the 9th or even the 10th of July, or before, but subsequently at the rate of $5,000 per day, and without any imputation being made at the time of payment or payments, so far as we can judge by the correspondence and the evidence.\nThe same operation was about repeated with regard to the second payment. On the 14th of August, Mr. T. Craig writes to the Department of Finance:\nReferring to our loan from you, and the $50,000 called, I should like to know if you have decided to wait until the 1st September for payment. Doing so would be a great convenience to us, but if that is impossible, I shall be greatly obliged if you will draw on us only at the rate of $ 10,000 every third day.\nOn the 15th the department answers:\nAs I wrote you the end of last month, my instructions were to call upon you to place $50,000 (of which due notice had been given) at the credit of the Receiver General's ordinary cash from the amount now at interest. I do not see how I can consent to its remaining until the 1st September. I shall however, be most happy to comply with your request about drawing out the money and will make it as easy as I can. Please send us a receipt showing that the amount has been transferred from \"interest\" to current account with the accrued interest thereon.\nOn the 16th, the bank, through James M. Craig, replied:\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, and herewith enclose receipt showing the current account with the department credited $50,315.07 (the $315.07 being for interest). Please return deposit receipt no. 358\u2014$50,000, in favour of the Receiver General and oblige.\nWhether special deposit receipt no. 358 was returned or not, does it not appear from the evidence.\nThe ordinary receipt referred to in the letter of the 16th, is plaintiff's exhibit no. 5, and reads as follows:\nExhibit No. 5.\nMemorandum Form To\nExchange Bank of Canada. Montreal, 15th Aug., 1883.\nMontreal.\nReceived from the Receiver General, for credit of current account with Finance Department the sum of fifty thousand three hundred and fifteen 07\/100 being for deposit receipt no. 358, within terest at the rate of five per cent, to date.\nJAMES M. CRAIG,\nD. M. G.\nPlease reply on this slip.\n4,000\u20134\u20138\u201377.\nIt appears from this document that when the second payment was made\u2014that is, when the transfer was made from the special deposit account to the general account on the 15th of August\u2014no imputation was made; this was only done on the 16th by the letter of James M. Craig.\nIt may be said that the transfer was not completed till it was accepted by, or at least notified to, the Government, that is on the 16th or 17th of August. But the acceptance had been made in advance, the transfer being in fact requested by the Government. But suppose the transfer was not perfect till so notified or accepted; it is admitted that no cash was paid either on the 15th, 16th or 17th of August and that an ordinary receipt, dated 15th August, 1883 (Exhibit no. 5) was merely substituted for deposit receipt no. 358, to be drawn against \"at the rate of $10,000 every third day.\"\nTo conclude, the above documents show only a provision or arrangement for payments, and no actual payments. With regard to the first payment, cheques could not be drawn before the 11th of July, and it must be remembered only at the rate of $5,000 per day, and with regard to the second one, before the 18th of August, at the rate of $10,000 every third day\u2014that is in each case, after the imputation had been made by the bank. At all events, it is clear to me that the imputations were not made at the time of the payments.\nIt is not essential to the validity of a payment that it should be made in cash; its equivalent may be accepted; any form or mode of payment may satisfy the debtor and creditor, either by bills, notes, transfer of credits, novations, compensation, dation en paiement, or otherwise. But no matter how made, it must have the effect of extinguishing the debt. So say all the commentators, both modern and ancient; 17 Laurent 597; 18 Id. 323; 21 Demolombe 26; 4 Larombiere, art. 1235, n. 1; 4 Marcade 661; Domat. liv. 4, tit. 1; Pothier, Obl. 493; Rousseaud de Lacombe, vo. Payement n. 12; Denisart, vo. Payement, nos. 1 and 14; C. N. Art. 1234. Likewise under the Quebec Code, a payment to be perfect must be one which ipso facto operates the extinguishment of the debt. Art. 1138. A payment will bind the surety only when so made; and consequently it is only when so made, and at the very time the debt becomes extinct, that any imputation of payment, whether conventional or legal, can affect him. Any other payment is a mere agreement. In this case, the substitution of receipts made in July and August, 1883, did not extinguish the debt and therefore did not constitute legal payments. At the time the payments were truly and really made, that is when the monies credited to the general account were checked out by the Government and were actually delivered by the debtor and received by the creditor, as contemplated by article 1139 C. C., no imputation was made by either of them, and consequently, according to the authorities, the surety was discharged under article 1161 of the Civil Code.\nIt may be said that the Government, by withdrawing the money as agreed to, has made the imputation at the time they actually received it. It cannot be contended that such imputation was stipulated at that moment; the Government simply received the money placed in its credit without saying anything. And how can an imputation be presumed from what had been done or agreed to previously? I have endeavoured to show, and I believe satisfactorily, at least to my mind, that any such action or agreement was null and void in so far as the surety was concerned, and cannot affect him.\nUpon the correspondence and the evidence I have no hesitation in arriving at this conclusion; but even if any doubt was possible, I would give the benefit of it to the respondent, not only by reason of the equity of the case, but especially in face of the books of the Department of Finance, Exhibit C. To my mind, the absence of any conventional imputation at the time the moneys were checked out is a reasonable explanation of this exhibit, for I must presume that the Finance Department knew the laws governing the case.\nFor these reasons, I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

S. Q. arts. 5163, 5164\u2014Art. 1590 C. C.\nIn matters of expropriation where the railway company has complied with the directions and conditions of articles 5163 and 5164 Revised Statutes of Quebec, as to deposit of plans and books of reference, notice and settlement of indemnity with the owners or with at least one-third of the owners par indivis of lands taken for railway purposes, the title to the lands passes forthwith to the company for the whole of the property by mere operation of the statute, even without the consent of the other owners par indivis, and without the necessity of formal conveyance by deed or compliance with the formalities prescribed by the Civil Code as to registration of real rights. The provisions of the Civil Code respecting the registration of real rights have no application to proceedings in matters of expropriation of lands for railway purposes under the provisions of the Revised Statutes of Quebec.\nPending expropriation proceedings begun against lands held in common, (par indivis,) for the purposes of appellant's railway, the following instrument was signed and delivered to the company by six out of nine of the owners par indivis viz.: \"Be it known by these presents that we the legatees Patterson of the Parish of Beauport, County of Quebec, do promise and agree that as soon as the Quebec, Montmorency and Charlevoix Railway is located through our land in Parishes of Notre-Dame des Anges Beauport and L'Ange-Gardien, and in consideration of its being so located, we will sell, bargain and transfer to the Quebec, Montmorency and Charlevoix Railway Company, for the sum of one dollar, such part of our said land as may be required for the construction and maintenance of the said railway and exempt the said company from all damages to the rest of the said property, and that, pending the execution of the deeds we will permit the construction of said railway to be proceeded with over our said land, without hindrances of any kind, provided that the said railway is located to our satisfaction. As witness our hands at Quebec this 11th day of June, in the year of Our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-six.''\nAfterwards, the line of the railway was altered and more than one year elapsed without the deposit of an amended plan and book of reference to show the deviation from the line as originally located. The company however took possession of the land and constructed the railway across it and, in August, 1869, the same persons who had signed the above instrument granted an absolute deed of the lands to the company for a consideration of five dollars, acknowledged to have been paid, reciting therein that the said lands had \"been selected and set apart by the said railway company for the ends and purposes of its railway and being already in the possession of the said railway company since the eleventh day of June, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-six, in virtue of a certain promise of sale sous seing prive by the said vendors in favour of the said company.\" Neither of the instruments were registered. G. purchased the New Water ford Cove property in 1889 and, after registering his deed, executed by all the owners par indivis, brought a petitory action to recover that part of the property taken by the railway company, alleging that the instruments mentioned constituted a donation of the lands and did not come within the operation of articles 5163 and 5164 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec.\nHeld that the terms of sub-section 10 of article 5164, R. S. Q. were sufficiently wide to include and apply to donations; that the instrument in question was not properly a donation, but a valid agreement or accord within the provisions of said tenth subsection, under onerous conditions of indemnity which appeared to have been satisfied by the company; that, as the agreement stipulated no time within which the new plan should be filed and the location appeared to have been made to the satisfaction of the required proportion of the owners, it was sufficient for the company to file the amended plan and book of reference at any time thereafter and that, as the indemnity agreed upon by six out of nine of the owners par indivis had been satisfied by changing the location of the railway line as desired, the requirements of article 5164 R. S. 0., had been fully complied with and the plaintiff's action could not, under the circumstances, be maintained.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPELL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec as to five-sevenths of the lands sought to be recovered by the petitory action herein and declaring the respondents to be the true and lawful owners thereof.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the head-note and also in the judgment of His Lordship, Mr. Justice Girouard.\nBelleau Q.O. and B\u00e9dard Q.C. for the appellant. In cases of expropriation, the acqu\u00e9reur cannot be ejected. The property passed to the company by mere operation of law. The consent of the owner is required only to fix the indemnity. C. C. 1590; Pothier, Vente, no. 513 2 Aubry & Ran n. 220. After the deposit of the plans, the expropriation can not be disturbed by any sale on the part of the proprietor. The land has become, for the purposes of the expropriation, extra commercium; and is replaced by the indemnity. R. S. Q. Art. 5164 s. 30. The transfer taking place by mere operation of law, no registration is required. R. S. Q. Art. 5164 s. 28; 23 Vict. ch. 61, s. 50; C. S. L. C. ch. 24, ' s. 50, s.s. 9; Mun. Code, Que., art. 903. Art. 5163, ss. 7,11 R. S. Q. permits deviations within a mile of the original location, and in this case the alteration was made in satisfaction of the indemnity demanded by the requisite proportion of the owners par indivis as a benefit for themselves. The company was bound only to satisfy them and was not obliged to file amended plans within any fixed time as in cases of forced proceedings under the Act. The indemnity was settled under a valid agreement for valuable consideration, by the payment of some money and the performance of the onerous conditions imposed to the satisfaction of two-thirds of the owners par indivis.\nIn virtue of the sous seing priv\u00e9 of 11th of June, 1886, the appellant had a free right of way through the New Waterford Cove to the satisfaction of the proprietors; it was confirmed by all the heirs by the reservation of the line in deed of January 1889 when the old location had been abandoned and the new one adopted to their satisfaction and also by the deed of August, 1889. Therefore, the contract having been fulfilled as a whole, the respondents are. as their auteurs were, stopped from repudiating part of it. When the plaintiff purchased he was aware that the legatees had sold the right of way through the New Waterford Cove and that at the date of the action the appellant had been for over a year the lawful proprietor in possession of the strip of land revindicated. Furthermore there was public notice of the expropriation on record by the deposit of the plans and books of reference in the registry office long prior to the purchase by plaintiff, and he was bound both by constructive and actual notice thereof Fitzpatrick Q.C. (Solicitor General for Canada), and Gibsone for the respondents. There are no registered title deeds prior to Gritstone's. No proper expropriation was made. The requirements of the Quebec Railway Act under which the company purported to act, are peremptory and a condition precedent to the valid appropriation of land. The requisite formalities were not fulfilled and only a plan was deposited. The respondents rely upon Corporation of Parkdale v. West ([1]), per Macnaghten L. J. at pp. 613-615, a case decided under the Consolidated Railway Act, the provisions of which are similar to those of Quebec Railway Act and Tue North Shore Railway Co. v. Pion ([2]), per Selborne L. J. at pp 624-5-6, 628, 629, decided under the Quebec Railway Act.\nThe memorandum in writing was never intended to have reference to the location now in question and the deed cannot be deemed a title under the Railway Act, nor at civil law, and in any case it was gratuitous and the description of the lands indefinite,\u2014said to be in the parishes of Notre-Dame des Anges, Beauport and L'Ange Gardien, whilst New Waterford Cove is situate in the Parish of St. Roch North. The contention that there had been a seigniory of Notre-Dame des Anges in this locality, and that as the parish of St. Roch North is within the old limits of this seigniory the memorandum must have reference to St. Roch North if admitted would apply to the half-dozen other parishes within the old seigniory, a construction which would be unreasonable. Further the seigniory was divided into parishes in 1835 and thereupon ceased to be a territorial division and such a description would he unreasonable in a contract which involved $50000. Even if the memorandum could have referred to the New Waterford Cove the only location mentioned was the abandoned location, and to change this location the company must make a new contract with the owners of the land. The legatees have not approved the present location, in fact disapprobation was shown by the legatees Patterson refusing to convey it to the company.\nThe plan of the present location was deposited on the 7th of August, 1889, and two days later a deed was passed, transferring a road-bed across the Montmorency property. Reference to this deed will shew that it was signed by the Patterson legatees m July when they could have had no knowledge of the intended change of location. The deed of 21st January, 1889, is so obviously anterior to the change of location that comment would be superfluous. The memorandum appears to be a promise of sale made by four persons, three having an eventual interest and the fourth none whatever; it does not purport to transfer ownership, and cannot operate as a sale, whatever legal relations it might have created between the signers and the railway company. There having been no right of way granted, it follows that the reference in the deed of January, 1889, cannot estop the plaintiffs, at any rate so far as regards the present location.\nThe cross-appeal is on the ground that the court below should have held the railway company bound to register even its titles under the Railway Act, such as awards and contracts made under ss. 7 and 10 of R, S. Q. Art. 5164. Even if the plaintiff had known that the company had a title to the land which was unregistered, it would not have been any bar to his purchasing the land and registering the title. Art. 2085 C. C.; Delesderniers v. Kingsley ([3]); Ross v. Daly ([4]); Thibeault v. JDupr\u00e9 ([5]); Farmer v. Devlin ([6]). When plaintiff acquired this property he paid a fair price for it, and in purchasing, in considering the company a trespasser, and in taking the present suit, he acted in the fullest good faith. The judgment below gives effect against the cross-appellants, purchasers for value in good faith with registered titles, to an unregistered common law conveyance of a portion of the lands claimed. The amount also for which judgment was, given is wrong. G. B. Hail and W. C. J. Hall could each give title to only one-ninth of the land, for the memorandum, and the clause in the deed of 21st of January, 1889, refer only to the extent of six-ninths and G. B. Hall and W. C. J. Hall were only two of the six persons, who had one-ninth share each, concerned in the matter. The court below wrongly declared the respondent owner of two-sevenths interest in the land, and this court should reverse that part of the judgment complained of and restore the judgment of the Superior Court, and condemn the respondent to pay all costs in this appeal and the courts below.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree with the majority of the court in the conclusion that this appeal must be allowed but I am unable to concur in the reasons assigned for that judgment.\nThe learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queens Bench, in whose judgment in this respect I concur, has, I think, satisfactorily demonstrated that the appellants acquired no title by expropriation under the provisions of the Railway Act. Further, it appears to me very clear that sec. 5164. subsec. 10 R. S. Q. does not apply in the appellants' favour. By that section it is enacted that:\nWhenever there is more than one person proprietor of any land as joint proprietor or proprietors in common, or par indivis, any contract or agreement made in good faith with any party or parties proprietor, or being together proprietors of one-third or more of such and. as to the amount of compensation for the same or for any damages thereto shall be binding as between the remaining proprietor or proprietors as joint proprietor or proprietors in common and par indivis.\nThe appellants have not brought their case within this section.\nI refer again to the Chief Justice's judgment as showing that this sec. 5164 has no application.\nI am not able, however to agree with the Court of Queen's Bench in rejecting the defence of the railway Company founded on Art. 1485 C C This Art. is as follows:\nJudges, advocates, attorneys, clerks, sheriffs, bailiffs and other officers connected with courts of justice, cannot become buyers of litigious rights which fall under the jurisdiction of the court in which they exercise their functions\nThe depositions in this record show that Mr. Gibsone was at the time he purchased the lands which he seeks to recover in this action an advocate practising in the courts of the district of Quebec within the jurisdiction of which these lands were situated. Further, at the time of the purchase the property was in the possession of the railway company and in use by them as part of the line of their railway.\nIt is said that this defence fails for these reasons: First, it is said that the respondent had no notice of the litigious character of the property; that he did not buy or intend to buy litigious rights at all but land which he purchased in good faith.\nI should not be able to bring myself to the conclusion that these reasons were sufficient to show the purchase a permissible one, even if I found no authority in support of my views, for when a man buys immoveable knowing the fact to be as Mr. Gibsone knew in the present case, that the land was in use as part of the line of a railway in actual operation, he must be taken to know that he could not make his purchase effectual without litigation which he must therefore be supposed to contemplate.\nArt. 1485 is in all material respects an exact reproduction of Art. 1597 of the French Code It is laid down by writers of authority that it is not essential to bring a sale within Art. 1485 that an action should be actually pending at the time of the sale. That the provision of the law refers to rights in immoveable property as well as to other litigious rights is also the interpretation universally put on the Art. 1485 The character of litigiosity is said to apply to an immoveable when a vendor, not having the actual detention of it at the time of sale is unable to deliver the possession.\nThat the term \" litigious rights is inclusive of the case last referred to is very clearly put in Ambry &-Rau ([7]) as follows:\nElle parait m\u00eamo devoir s'appliquer \u00e0 la. vente d'un immeuble dont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est litigieuse aussi.bien qu'\u00e0 Ia cession d'un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 litigieux, alors du moins que le vendeur, ne d\u00e9tenant point l'immeuble vendu, se trouve hors d'\u00e9tat d'en faire Ia delivrance.\nThe law is laid down in the same terms by other commentators ([8]). These authorities might be greatly added to as well by citations from authors as by reference to the \"jurisprudence which seems to be uniform the same way. The point is one of some public importance inasmuch as speculative tiaffic in the land actually occupied by railway companies for the purposes of their permanent way is certainly one which ought not to be encouraged. I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nTaschereau J.\u2014I agree with my brother Girouard that this appeal should be allowed, and respondent's action dismissed. The heirs Hall and Patterson would not have a right to this action. They would be estopped by conduct and by deeds. And that being so, the respondents acquired no rights from them. The appeal is allowed with costs, and the action dismissed with costs in all the courts against respondents. Cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSEDCEWICK J. concurred.\nKING J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed for the reasons contained in the judgment of His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014A railway company incorporated by the Legislature of Quebec, and proceeding to expropriate for the purpose of constructing its line of railway must follow the directions indicated in sections 5163 and following of the Revised Statutes of Quebec. The proceedings commence by depositing in the Department of Public Works and in the Registry Office of the county, through which it is intended to build the railway, a plan and book of reference showing its location, and more particularly the lots of land to be traversed and the names of their proprietors; and if it becomes necessary to deviate an amended plan and book of reference must also be deposited Art. 5163, pars. 1, 7, 8.\nOne month after the notice of the deposit of the plan and book of reference, the company may settle the indemnity to be paid amicably, if agreed to with the proprietors, or proceed to establish it by arbitration; and. the statute declares that all contracts and arrangements made to that effect are to be valid and binding to all intents and purposes and have the effect of vesting the property of said lands in the company, without any charge, restriction or limitation. .Art. 5164 pars. 3, 5, 11. Even before the deposit of any plan and book of reference, an agreement, or arrangement, to use the French version of the statute made with any proprietor, is binding and obligatory, if the location of the road be duly made during the year following; and in such a case paragraph 7 of the same section enacts that the company may, even against a third party who has since acquired in good faith, take possession of the land, according to the terms of the arrangement, to the same effect as if the price had been fixed by an award of the arbitrators. This law is so liberal that in order to facilitate the transfer of lands, special powers are granted to corporations, tutors, women, gr\u00e9v\u00e9s de substitution, par. 3; and with regard to undivided property held in common by several persons, par. 10 provides that any contract or agreement or accord, made in good faith with the proprietors of one-third of the same, is binding upon all\nUpon tender or payment of the amount awarded or agreed to by the parties, the company is entitled to have immediate possession of the land, and upon payment or tender of the indemnity they may even forcibly procure the same through the ministry of the sheriff of the district Par 28\nFinally, if the amount awarded by the arbitrators be not paid by the company within two months, the proprietor may recover the property and possession of his land and also damages; par. 29. Admitting that this enactment applies likewise to the default of payment of the indemnity agreed to between the parties a proposition which is perhaps open to some doubt that is the only ground under the statute for which the company can be evicted, namely the non-payment of the indemnity. It is also the principle laid down in article 1590 of the Civil Code.\nThe respondent, by his petitory action, revendicates from the appellants some lots of land or their value, $6500. These lots are in their possession for the purposes of their railway and are known as the New Waterford Cove, near the City of Quebec, on the eastern side of the River St. Charles, in the seigniory of Notre Dame des Anges and being part of the cadastral numbers 560 561 562 and 570 of the cadastre of the parish of St. Roch North, in the County of Quebec.\nThis action was taken on the 13th day of November, 1892.\nThe appellants were incorporated in 1881, by an Act of the Province of Quebec, 44 & 45 Vict. ch. 44. They were empowered to build a railway from the City of Quebec to the Saguenay river. On the 9th March 1883. they deposited the plan and book of reference for the first section of their line starting from the City of Quebec and going to the Montmorency River. But for various reasons which it is not necessary to explain the location of the track through the New Waterford Cove and through the extensive Montmorency lumber yards and mills was only roughly indicated in the plan and book of reference; it was made plain, however, that the line of railway was running through those lands, although the book of reference did not extend over the Montmorency property The heirs Hall and Patterson nine in number were owners not only of the Montmorency mills and yards in Beauport and L'Ange Gardien, but also of the New Waterford Cove. Both estates, and especially the Montmorency one, were to benefit largely by the construction of this railway. The cove was the property of the heirs Hall, and the Montmorency mills and yards that of the heirs or legatees Patter-son; but, as already observed, the heirs Hall and the heirs or legatees Patterson were the same persons s and so the title to both the Montmorency mills and the New Waterford Cove was vested in the same proprietors in common.\nOn the 11th day of June, 1886, while the company was slowly proceeding with its work, six out of the nine proprietors signed and delivered to the appellants the following document, sous seing priv\u00e9:\nBe it known by these presents that we, the legatees Patterson, of the parish of Beauport. County of Quebec, do promise and agree that as soon as the Quebec, Montmorency and Charlevoix Railway is located through our land in parishes of Notre Dame des Anges, Beau-port and L'Ange Gardien, and in consideration of its being so located, we will sell, bargain and transfer to the Quebec, Montmorency and Charlevoix Railway Company, for the sum of one dollar, such part of our said land as maybe required for the construction and maintenance of the said railway; and exempt the said company from all damages to the rest of the said property, and that, pending the execution of the deeds, we will permit the construction of the said railway to be proceeded with over our said land, without hinderance of any kind provided that the said railway is located to oui satisfaction.\nThe difficulty between the parties arises only with regard to the New Waterford Cove property valued at the time at $6000 or 7000 and has no reference to the Montmorency property valued at about $250,000, all the heirs having formally declared that, with regard to the latter, they were satisfied with the proceedings of the railway company and especially the location of its line by granting them an absolute deed of sale of the land by deed of the 9th day of August, 1889, without making any reservation whatever as to the New Waterford Cove property and in which deed they declare '. The above described parcels of land having, been selected and set apart by the said railway company for the ends and purposes of its railway and being already in the possession of the said railway company since the eleventh day of June one thousand eight hundred and eighty-six, in virtue of a certain promise of sale sous seing priv\u00e9 by the said vendors in favour of the said company.\nThe railway was completed in September, 1888, from the Montmorency River to lot 562 of Saint Koch North, through lot 570, which formed part of the cove.\nOn the 7th August, 1889, a deviation of the plan of 1883 was deposited showing the new location contemplated in the agreement of 1886, which showed a considerable change of the line through the New Waterford cove, and particularly lots 560, 561 and 562. The railway was built at once over the new location; the appellants were working at it in 1889, and the whole work was completed in the spring of 1890, and ever since the appellants have been in public possession of the lands for the purposes of their railway.\nThe first, and in fact the only, question tobe decided is the validity of the agreement of 1886, and its effect. Was it an arrangement within the meaning of the Railway Act or simply a promise of sale ? Was it binding upon all the proprietors ? Was the approbation of the location a condition suspensive or precedent? Was it necessary to have a deed in the notarial form and registered like an ordinary deed of sale ? Can the arrangement be enforced at the present time ?\nIt seems clear to me that if the arrangement of 1886 is to have any validity it must be under the provisions of the Quebec Railway Act. As I understand them notarial deeds of transfer are not necessary and in many cases not obtainable for instance when the proprietors are unknown or refuse to agree with the \u2022company and an arbitration becomes necessary. Registration of deeds of transfer in the usual form is not required; it is intended to be replaced by the deposit and registration of the plans and books of reference and all interested parties are bound to take notice of the same and this is also the opinion which the Court of Appeal expressed when rendering the judgment appealed from.\nThe agreement of 1886 had in contemplation a new and definite location of the railway to be made over the lands therein mentioned, and not one already made; this clearly results from the following words. The legatees Patterson promised to sell and transfer as soon \" as the railway i is located through our land.\" It also affords an explanation why they provided that the said location should be made to their satisfaction.\n\"Was this a suspensive condition of the transfer The stipulation was not that their approbation be first obtained, but \"that the said railway be located to our satisfaction.\" If the location was not satisfactory to-them they should have protested, but they did not do so; quite the reverse; in signing the deed of the 9th August, 1889, without any reservation, they have acquiesced in writing in the location, and moreover--they allowed the work to be proceeded with without raising the slightest objection, either by injunction or action, or in any manner or form whatever. In fact the evidence shows that all the heirs were satisfled with the location.\nThe respondent says that their refusal to sign a deed of sale of the New Waterford Cove property was a sufficient protest. But I do not consider that such a deed was necessary; no promise of sale, in fact no sale, is required from the proprietor under the Railway Act the settlement of the indemnity alone is required and thereupon the land passes by mere operation of the Act If the agreement of 1886 had any validity in 1889 when the said deed of sale was demanded, it was not as a promise of sale, but as an agreement or accord settling the indemnity; the parties intended evidently to have a deed of sale as an act of prudence but in my opinion it was not necessary. The agreement and the deposit of the plan and book of reference as amended had the effect of transferring the lands in question by mere operations of law and the agreement was only necessary to ascertain the amount of the indemnity, in the absence of an award and thus perfect the transfer.\nBut had the agreement of 1886 any force in 1889, as more than a year had elapsed from its date without the deposit of an amended plan and book of reference therein referred to, as required, it is contended, by paragraph 7, of article 5164 of the Revised Statutes? That seems to me to be the whole difficulty in the case.\nIn the first place, is the agreement to be governed by that enactment ? Is it to be considered as an arrangement made before any plan and book of reference were deposited ? Such a plan and book did exist and were duly deposited; the New Waterford Cove property was indicated in it, roughly it is true as to the precise location of the railway, but with certainty as to the property to be traversed, a fact which the plan and the book of reference show beyond doubt; the case was therefore one of a plan and book of reference to be amended or completed to suit the proprietors- The agreement of 1886 was not one contemplated by article 5164, par. 7, that is before the proceedings in expropriation were commenced; it was an arrangement pending the expropriation and must be treated as such under paragraphs 7 and 8, of article 5163, and paragraphs 5 and 10 of article 5164. It had undoubtedly in view a location not yet determined, a new and amended plan; the location to the satisfaction of the proprietors was the consideration for it, but this could be done at any time under the clause which permits deviations from deposited plans, art. 5163, par. 7 , the agreement stipulates no delay within which the new plan must be fyled, and in my humble opinion it was sufficient for the company to do so at any time there-after provided it was done to the satisfaction of the proprietors, which was undoubtedly the case here, as I have already observed. The question of the indemnity being thus settled by the granting of a suitable location nothing more remained to be done to vest the lands in the company; this took place by mere operation of the law without any other formality, and more particularly without any deed of sale, under paragraphs 5 and 10 of article 5164. The action of the respondent should therefore be dismissed with costs as his title is posterior to that of the appellants.\nThe clerical error in the description of the New Waterford Cove in the agreement of 1886, as being in the \" parish \" of Notre Dame des Anges, instead of the \"seigniory \" of Notre Dame des Anges, is covered and rectified in the deed of the 21st January 1889 where it is properly described as lots Nos. 560, 561, 562 and 570 of the official cadastre of the Parish of Saint Roch North. I do not moreover look upon an erroneous description of this kind as fatal to the arrangement; article 5163, par. 5, 12; the latter is supposed to cover the immoveables mentioned in the plan and book of reference deposited, and there is no dispute as to their identity.\nIt is not disputed that at the time the above deeds were granted to the appellants, the grantors were the true and lawful owners par indivis of the lands in question having a right to make an arrangement with the railway company within the meaning of the Railway Act. True, the deeds of the appellants were never registered, but, as I have already observed, I have no hesitation in agreeing with the Court of Appeals that the registration regulations of the Civil Code do not apply to proceedings in expropriation under the Railway Act. The respondent as subsequent purchaser was bound to take notice of the registration of the plan and book of reference and of their amendment made by the railway company, and if he did not do so it was at his risk and peril.\nThe respondent was fully aware of the arrangement; he had even signed the deeds of sale of the 21$t of January, 1889, and 9th August, 1889, as attorney for two of the heirs and if under article 2085 of the Civil Code bad faith is no answer to a plea of want of registration that article must be limited to the case therein mentioned, of a deed, document or right subject to the formality of registration, and not be applied to a case like the present one, where no registration is required and the transmission of real property or rights takes effect by mere operation of law.\nIt has been contended that the agreement of the 11th of June 1886 if valid at all, was not an agreement or accord within the meaning of the Railway Act, and that more particularly paragraph 10 of art. 5164 contemplates agreements or contracts for money consideration and not mere donations or gifts which it is alleged, could bind only the parties who consent. Paragraph 10 does not make any such distinction; its terms are wide enough to comprise all kinds and forms of contracts, even mere donations, the only restriction being good faith. It reads as follows:\nWhenever there is more than one person proprietor of any land as joint proprietor, or proprietors in common or par indivis, any contract or agreement made in good faith with any party or parties, proprietor, or being together proprietors of one-third or more of such land as to the amount of compensation for the same or for any damages thereto, shall be binding as between the remaining proprietor or proprietors as joint proprietors or proprietors in common and par indivis\nMere donations are sometimes highly beneficial to the donors, and frequently the construction of a line of railway will give value to estates which till then were almost valueless, and the New Waterford Cove proves to have been a property of that kind.\nBut it is not true to say that the agreement contained a mere donation. The stipulation that the line was to be located both at Montmorency and the Cove, to the satisfaction of the proprietors, was a very onerous charge and proved to be so a fact which is fully established by the testimony of Mr. H. M. Price and of Mr. wm. Russell; it was made in good faith and in the interest of all concerned and it is only fair and just that it should be binding upon all, especially as it was consented to by six out of nine proprietors par Indivis\nFinally, I look upon par. 29, of art. 5164 of the Railway Act as fatal to the action of the respondent. The indemnity agreed to between the appellants and -six of the proprietors was undoubtedly paid; true it did not consist in the payment of money to the proprietors; but this is not required by the Act, as I understand it; parties may settle in any manner they please. Here it consisted in the location of the railway which would suit them this was done and as I read the above clause of the Railway Act, the company cannot be evicted and the proprietors cannot recover the property, nor the possession of their lands. The satisfaction, of the indemnity is an absolute bar to the action.\nUpon the whole I am of opinion that the appellants are proprietors under the Railway Act of the New Waterford Cove, or part of lots 560 561 562 and -57 0 of Saint Roch North, in question in this cause under the agreement of the 11th June, 1886; that the document in question required no registration and that being signed by the proprietors par indivis of more than one-third of the said lots it conveyed the whole property to the appellants, even in the absence of, or against the consent of, the other proprietors. The appeal of the railway company should be allowed and the cross-appeal of the respondent dismissed with costs, and his action also dismissed with costs said costs to be taxed against the respondent par reprise d'nstance.\nAppeal allowed with costs and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant Malouin B\u00e9dard & D\u00e9ch\u00e9ne.\nSolicitor for the respondents: F.

APPEAL from the decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment at the trial by which the plaintiff recovered damages and obtained an injunction restraining defendant from maintaining a dam on his land which flooded that of the plaintiff.\nThe action for damages and an injunction was brought under the following circumstances. The defendant McBryan is owner of lands bordering on a river. Behind his land is the property of the railway company, and beyond that land owned by Shaw, from which there is a slight depression through the railway property and McBryan's land to the river. Shaw every year brought water from a creek some distance away to irrigate his land, and in order to prevent the flow of such water through a culvert built by the railway company from flooding his property McBryan put a dam immediately below the railway track which sent the water back but not doing any injury to the other properties. In 1895 Shaw used much more water for irrigation than he had previously and the dam not being high enough to hold it back it was raised to the extent necessary to protect McBryan's property, but as a result the quantity of water sent back on the land of the railway company was such as to cause considerable damage, compensation for which, and to prevent a continuance of the same, was the object of the present action.\nA judgment for the plaintiff at a former trial was set aside by the Supreme Court of British Columbia and a new trial ordered[2]. On the second trial the plaintiff again obtained a verdict, and an injunction was granted restraining defendant from penning back the water from his land so as to injure the plaintiff's property. This judgment having been sustained by the full court the defendant appealed. Aylesworth Q.C. and Wilson Q.C. for the appellant. This case cannot be distinguished from Ostrom v. Sills [3]. Defendant had a right to protect his own property and was not obliged to look after the rights of his neighbour. Nield v. London & North Western Railway Co.[4] ; Collins v. Middle Level Commissioners [5].\nS. H. Blake Q.C. for the respondent, cited Whalley v. Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway Co.[6] ; Roberts v. Rose[7] ; Wilson v. Waddell[8].\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I will not dissent, but it is with the greatest hesitation that I concur in allowing the the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Prior to the year 1883, the owners and occupiers of a farm situate on the South Thompson River at a place called Shushwap in British Columbia of which one Shaw is and since about 1890 has been tenant under one Sullivan, the owner in fee, conducted by artificial works water for irrigation purposes on the farm but provided no means for carrying off any surplus waters so introduced. The defendant in 1883 owned an adjoining lot into which such waters, following the natural declivity of the soil, of necessity flowed by reason of there not having been constructed any mode of carrying off such waters, and instead of bringing an action against the owners and occupiers of the farm by whom the said waters were so introduced for irrigation purposes, to compel them to provide a proper mode for the escape of such waters so that they should not prejudice the defendant's lot, he in that year 1883 erec- ted a solid earth embankment on his own land close to the line between the two lots so as to prevent any of such irrigation waters so introduced into the adjoining lot from flowing on to the defendant's land to his pre judice. That he had a perfect right so to do cannot admit of a doubt. Subsequently, and in 1884 or 1885, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company purchased from the then owner in fee of the said lot adjoining the defendant's lot, for the purposes of their railway, the lowest part of the said lot adjoining the defendant's, and over which the irrigation waters so introduced passed until they reached the obstruction so erected by the defendant, and they built their railway thereon laying their track upon the surface of the land as it then was. Now the purchase of that strip of land by the railway company did not in any the slightest degree prejudice the right of the defendant to maintain the obstruction so as aforesaid erected upon his own land for the purpose aforesaid. The railway company were under no obligation to suffer or permit the waters, to pen back which the defendant had erected said embankment, to continue to flow over the land so purchased by them for their railway track, but they did suffer such waters so to continue to flow and things continued for many years in the same condition, namely, the waters being suffered by the railway company to flow over their land until they reached the said, embankment on defendant's land, and that obstruction continued to serve the purpose for which it was erected, namely, to protect defendant's land from injury from such waters. In or about the year 1892 Sullivan, the owner in fee of the said lot adjoining the land of the defendant except the piece thereof which had been purchased by the railway company for their railway, demised the part of which he was so seized in fee to. one Shaw who has since been and still is tenant under such demise. In 1895 the railway company resolved to fill up the lowest part of the said lot purchased by them at the place where the irrigation waters introduced by Shaw upon the farm leased to him by Sullivan entered upon the piece of land purchased by the railway company, and instead of preventing such irrigation waters entering upon their land as they could easily have done by the embankment they were constructing they constructed and placed a box culvert under the embankment which they constructed through which they caused Shaw's irrigation waters to pass and to discharge themselves as they had previously done over the natural surface on to the defendant's farm where they were stopped by the embankment erected by the defendant in 1883. Immediately after the completion by the railway company of their embankment and their so conducting the Shaw irrigation waters through the box culvert below to the defendant's land, Shaw brought upon his farm a much larger quantity of irrigation water than ever had previously been brought and the consequences were that these waters passing through the box culvert constructed by the railway company for their reception broke down and destroyed the defendant's embankment upon his land and washed away and destroyed a large piece of the soil of his farm. The defendant, instead of bringing an action to recover compensation for the injury so done to him, reconstructed the embankment which had been so destroyed and made it stronger and higher, and Shaw still continued to bring very large quantities of irrigation water on to his farm, which waters the railway company still continued to bring through the box culvert so as to reach the embankment so re-constructed on his land whereby such waters were penned back on to the railway company's track and did some damage to recover compensation for which this action is brought, and so instead of the defendant being a plaintiff in an action for the wrong done to him by thedestruction of the embankment constructed by him in 1883 and the destruction of a considerable portion of the soil of his farm is defendant in an action for injury sustained by the railway company by their not merely permitting Shaw's irrigation waters to pass over their land so as to reach the defendant's embankment, but by so conducting such waters through a culvert constructed by them for that purpose on their lands. The jury have, very sensibly in my opinion, found that the railway company have thus themselves been the cause of the damage of which they complain.\nIt has been contended that Roberts v. Rose, in the Exchequer Chamber,[9], is an authority in support of the railway company's contention in the present case, but a moment's comparison of the facts in that case with those in the present case as stated above and a cursory consideration of the observation of Blackburn J. in that case will show the plain distinction between the two cases. There the plaintiff by parol license granted to him by one Lowe and the defendant, constructed a water course for carrying off water from certain mines of the plaintiff into and through Lowe's land on to and through the defendant's land. The defendant had revoked the license to plaintiff and refused to permit him any longer so to carry off such mine waters and, the plaintiff having refused to discontinue so passing them, entered upon Lowe's land to stop the water course where the plaintiff's mine waters entered the water course on Lowe's land. The plaintiff contended that the defendant had no right to do so, but that he should have stopped up the water course on his own land, the effect of which would have been to pen back the waters and make a pond of Lowe's land. In this state of facts the court held that to have so done would have been a wrong to Lowe, who was an innnocent party inasmuch as he by an arrangement to which the defendant was himself a party had permitted the plaintiff so to discharge his mine waters through his land. For the defendant under such circumstances to have penned back the waters upon Lowe's land as plaintiff insisted he should have done would have been a serious wrong to Lowe, who under the circumstances was reasonably called an innocent party. There is nothing in the present case which can entitle the railway company to that designation upon the authority of anything in Roberts v.Rose[10], so far as affects the rights and interests of the defendant to maintain on his own ground a construction of the nature of that erected by him in 1883, and restored in 1895, when wrongfully destroyed by waters tortiously brought down over the railway company's land upon and against an embankment lawfully erected and maintained upon his own land for its protection.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs, and the action in the court below be ordered to be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014 The appellant Alexander McBryan is the owner of lands bounded on the lower side by the Thompson river. At the back of his lands are the track, roadbed and right of way of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, the respondents, and on the other side of the railway are the lands of one Pearson Shaw. All these lands are, so far as the eye can see, practically level, there being, however, a fall, although almost imperceptible, towards the river. There is, however, a slight depression or valley, commencing on Shaw's land extending across: the railway track and along McBryan's land to the river. There is no water-course, either natural or artificial, along this depression, but in times of heavy rains or of melting snow surface water runs across the properties to the river. When the railway company built their line they used trestle work to carry the track across this depression, and subsequently they filled up the trestle work with earth, constructing a culvert to provide for the downfall of the water. Shaw, the upper proprietor, had been in the habit of irrigating his land for agricultural purposes, obtaining the water from a creek some distance away. In order to prevent the surface water which necessarily would flow down the depression through the culvert on to McBryan's land from injuring him the latter built a dam on his own land across the depression immediately below the railway track, the effect being that the water which came down was prevented from flooding it, the water being penned back both onto the property of the railway company and of Shaw, but at that time not doing any injury to either property. In the summer of 1895 Shaw brought a much larger quantity of water on his land than he had before done. This water flowed through the culvert and over McBryan's land, the dam there not being sufficient to hold it back. It did great damage to the crops and was tearing away the soil, washing a considerable portion of it into the river, and if it had been allowed to continue irreparable injury would have been sustained by McBryan. The defendant seeing his property injured and his lands washed away immediately proceeded to heighten the dam, doing it at a comparatively small expense, the result being that no further damage was done to his property. It happened, however, that the dam was higher than the roadbed and tracks of the railway. The water coming down from Shaw's land flooded the railway track, damaging the company's property to the extent of $125. The company thereupon brought this action, not against Shaw who was the admitted Jons et origo mali, but against McBryan. The case was tried and judgment was given in favour of the company. Upon appeal to the court en banc this judgment was sustained.\nIt was admitted by the defendant that he might have as easily built a dam on the other side of the railway track as on his own property, and it also appeared that neither the railway company nor McBryan ever gave any license for such a use of their lands. The contention of the plaintiff company is that the defendant had no right to erect the dam in question on his own land ; that if he wished to abate the nuisance he was bound to erect the dam in such a way as not to cause damage to the railway property. In other words that it was not only his privilege, which every one admitted, but his duty either to take legal proceedings or to cross over the railway track and erect the dam upon the lands of the upper proprietor, whose action caused the mischief. The defendant on the other hand contends that he was acting within his strict legal rights; that the dam being built, not particularly for the purpose of abating a nuisance, but for the purpose of protecting his own property from destruction, he was justified in doing so even although the effect of it was to damage to some extent his immediate neighbour.\nI am of opinion that the contention of the defendant is the correct one, and that the company, instead of proceeding against him, should have proceeded against the upper proprietor. It is, I think, a universal principle that a man may do what he likes with his own, provided that in so doing he does not interfere with some legal right of his neighbour. In the present case, as I have stated, there was no natural watercourse, there was not even an artificial watercourse, and in so far as the defendant's lands were damaged it was a pure act of trespass on the part of Shaw from which the delendant had a clear right to protect himself by all lawful means irrespective of any consequences which might happen to other parties. To prevent the defendant under the circumstances, when he saw his lands being flooded and his property washed away, from interposing a barrier at the boundary of his property and sending the water back the way it came, would, I think, be most unreasonable. To compel him to cross over and perhaps trespass upon the railway lands in order that he might erect a similar barricade on Shaw's land would be even more so. And I cannot see why, when he did nothing more than protect himself by the fair and reasonable methods he used, the company can compel him to pay the damages they sustained, particularly when they had ample means of redress from the originator of the mischief, and could as easily have protected themselves from injury as the defendant had done. It seems to me, with great deference, that any other contention is manifestly erroneous. Let me put a few illustrations demonstrating, as I conceive, that error.\nI have a sheep ranch on the foot-hills of the Rockies. I descry in the distance a horde of mountain wolves evidently intending to attack my herds. Their course of attack is apparent. I summon my servants and we erect a barricade sufficiently strong to hurl them back. In consequence of their repulse they attack my neighbour's herd some distance off. Am I to be responsible for the damage the wolves have done my neighbour ? Or, I see a prairie fire approaching me from the distance. It means inevitable destruction to my pro- perty unless I can devise a method of arresting its progress. On the margin of my property I plough up a strip of prairie. The flames reaching this strip are unable to surmount it. The wind or other causes as often happens sends the fire in other directions and my neighbour's fields and buildings are burned. Am I responsible for that damage ? Or, I surround my young orchard with a thick evergreen hedge to protect it from the northern blast. The cold winds thus turned from their accustomed course strike against the fruit trees of my neighbour, so that they wither and die. Am I responsible for the loss ? Or take a case which continuously happens in every northern village and town on this continent. My second door neighbour allows snow to accumulate in his back garden. In the spring it melts, overflows my next door neighbour's garden and is on the point of attacking the foundation of my house and threatening my cellar I raise my cellar wall and as a consequence the garden of my immediate neighbour is overwhelmed by the flooding water. Am I responsible for that, and must I, as the contention is, in order to protect my cellar cross over my neighbour's property to the property of his neighbour and erect a wall of masonry there ? That, I say, would be absurd. In all these cases, instead of putting up protective works on my own estate I might with equal inconvenience to myself and equal benefit as well, have put them up on or beyond the limits of my neighbor's land. Does the obligation of neighbourhood impose that duty upon me. And if so, and I fulfil it, will not my neighbour's neighbour have a similar claim for the damage I have done him ? And how far afield must I go ? These illustrations contain their own refutation, otherwise it might be an actionable wrong to plant a hedge or erect a party wall or fence, or even build one's house upon a water-proof foundation. They are common enemies, the wolf, the fire, the wind, the flood, and every one must of necessity have a right to defend himself within his own'domain against them.\nThe English authorities, so far as they go, are, in my view, in favour of the appellant's contention. They well known case of Chasemore v. Richards [11],has definitely settled the question so far as percolating water is concerned, deciding that you may without incurring liability so work your own land by mining or otherwise as to do material damage to your neighbour by diverting water from his wells andjdepriving him absolutely of their use ; and the cases would seem to show that there is no distinction between underground percolating water and surface water, no natural watercourse being concerned. Mr. Goddard in his work on Easements, fourth edition, page 85 (5 ed. p. 88) says :\nThe case of flood water is different from that of flowing streams, and the principles of law relating to the latter do not relate to floods ; but it may be mentioned in passing that every landowner has a right at common law to protect his land from damage from floods, and for that purpose to erect dams or other defences to divert the flood\u2014water from its natural course.\nIn support of this, Trafford v. The King[12], and Nieldv. London & North\u2014 Western Railway Co.[13], are cited. The author in a foot note proceeds to\/remark :\nFrom these decisions it does not appear clear whether the landowner who defends himself against floods, incurs liability to another person, if by his act the flood-water is thrown upon the other's land and does injury there. In Trafford v. Rex[14], TindalC. J. said the exercise of the right was subject to the restriction that the person exercising it did not thereby occasion injury to the lands or property of other \"persons ; but in the case of Nield v. The London & North Western\\Railway Go.[15], it was held that as the water was not brought into the canal by the defendants they were not liable for damage caused to a neighbour owing to their act of defence. The latter principle appears the more reasonable of the two, for the natural result of preventing water coming on one man's land is to force it to flow on to the land of another, where it is sure to be more or less prejudicial. How thenjcan it be said that there is a right to defend one's own land by forcing the water on to another person's ground, and yet that it is wrong to cause the injury which must necessarily follow ?\nIn this case a flood had occurred in a canal from the bursting of the banks of an adjoining river and the canal company placed a barricade across the canal above their premises and thereby flooded the plaintiffs premises.It was held the company was not liable.\nThe flood (says Bramwell B. at p. 7) is a common enemy against which every man has a right to defend himself. And it would be most mischievous if the law were otherwise for a man must then stand by and see his property destroyed out of fear lest some neighbour might say \"you have caused me an injury.\" The law allows what I may term a kind of reasonable selfishness in such matters ; it says \"Let every one look out for himself and protect his own interest,\" and he who puts up a barricade against a flood is entitled to say to his neighbour who complains of it: Why did not you do the, same? I think what is said in Menzies v. Earl of Breadalbane[16], is an authority for this and the rule BO laid down is quite consistent with what one would understand to be the natural rule. Where, indeed, there is a natural outlet for natural water no one has a light for his own purpose to diminish it, and if he does so he is, with some qualification, perhaps, liable to any one who has been injured by this act, no matter where the water which does the mischief came into the water course. I say with some qualification because it may be that even in the case of a natural water course the riparian owner is entitled to protect himself against extraordinary floods by keeping off extraordinary water.\nIn this country the question indirectly came up before the Court of Queen's Bench, Upper Canada, in the case of L'Esperance v. The Great Western Railway Co.[17], in the year 1856. In this case the railway company had purchased certain lands from the plaintiff and had built their railway upon them. It happened that there was an artificial underground drain which the company blocked up, the consequence being that the plaintiff's lands were flooded. It was held that the company not being under a burden in regard to the drain, the plaintiff not having reserved a right of drainage in the conveyance, the action could not be maintained, the railway company having the right to deal with their land as they pleased. I do not cite this case with a view of expressing an opinion whether,under existing railway law and legislation, that decision would be now followed, but for the purpose of quoting what Mr. Justice Burns says in his judgment at page 178.\nThe present case presents (he says) so far as disclosed by the declaration and what was proposed to be proved, the case of a party using his own land, for his own purposes, in a way which prevents the use of an artificial work formerly constructed on that land, which no legal right to maintain is shewn on the one side, and no obligation arising either from contract or duty to be observed, having regard to the laws of nature to permit longer to exist on the other side. The passage in Domat, section 1581, seems to me to apply precisely to this case : \"He who in making a new work upon his own estate uses his right, without trespassing either against any law, custom, title or possession which may subject him to any service towards his neighbours, is not answerable for the damage which they may chance to sustain thereby, unless it be that he made that change merely with a view to hurt others, without any advantage to himself. For in this case it would be a pure act of malice, which equity would not allow of. But if the work were useful toliimas, if he made in his estate any lawful repairs, to secure it against the overflowing of a torrent or river, and his neighbours' grounds were thereby the more exposed to the flood or suffered from thence any other inconvenience, he could not be made answerable for it.\nThis passage from Domat, (Strahan's translation, Cushing's ed. Liv. ii. tit. viii, sec. iii, no. 9 of the French edition) must now in those provinces of Canada, where the English common law prevails, be modified so far as it refers to malice, having in view the late decision of the House of Lords in Allan v. Flood[18]. But it shows clearly that the civil law on this subject is in accord with my view of what English law is. The recent case in this court of Oslrom v. Sills [19] is, I think, applicable to the present case and must conclusively lead us to the allowance of this appeal. In that case we simply confirmed the judgment of Mr. Justice Moss in the Court of Appeal. In that judgment the following passage occurs :\nI think that the defendants are entitled to judgment because in doing what is complained of they are protecting themselves against the acts of other parties by means of something put up on their own land as a barrier, and not as a medium for conducting the waters from their premises to, and casting them upon, the plaintiff's premises.\nIn that case water, not a natural stream, was allowed by the municipality to overflow defendants' land on the lower side of a highway. The defendants erected a building cutting off the water from flowing over them, and thereby necessarily diverted it so that it flowed upon and injured the lands of a neighbour; it was held there was no action. The object to be gained by the foundation wall in Oslrom v. Sills[20], and by the dam in the present case was the same ; in the former to protect the foundation wall and cellar from the waters coming through the street drain, and in the latter to protect the farm from being washed into the river.\nThe plaintiff's counsel in support of his contention, supported it mainly from the maxim sic utere, etc., as illustrated in the cases of Rylands v. Fletcher[21]; Roberts v. Rose[22] ; and Whalley v. Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway Co.[23]. Rylands v. Fletcher[24], has no application to this case as between the plaintiff and the defendant. Its only application is as to the right of the railway company to proceed against Shaw. So far from the defendant here bringing upon his ground material which if let. loose might do damage to his neighbour, he did not bring or collect it there at all ; his sole object in building the dam was to prevent the invasion upon his land of noxious material gathered from the lands of another. The facts in Roberta v. Rose[25], were different from those here. And Lord Blackburn in making his observations relied on at page 89, was referring not to what a man might do upon his own land for the purpose of protecting it from attack by water or otherwise, but was referring only to how one might upon the lands of another abate a nuisance. Besides in so far as it aids the plaintiffs it must be deemed to bo modified by Lord Bramwell's subsequent decision in the Nield Case [26] above referred to. The facts were different to those in the Whalley Case[27]. Had the defendant here after he had erected his dam and penned back the accumulating waters suddenly demolished it allowing the waters to pour down inundating lands on the other side of his property, that would give rise to a state of facts and possibly to a state of law not applicable here.\nFor a full discussion of the American law see Angell on Watercourses, sec. 108 a, et seq.\nOn the whole I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs both here and below, and that the action should be dismissed with costs.\nKING and GIROUARD JJ. concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

C.\nA substitution created by a donation inter vivos in favour of the children of the institute, even before they are born, is irrevocable after acceptance by their parent; and the law of the Province of Quebec on the subject, as declared by the Civil Code, is the same as the old law of that province in existence before the promulgation of the Civil Code of Lower Canada.\nWhere an institute has accepted a donation creating a substitution in favour of his children, his acceptance as institute constitutes valid acceptance of the substitution on behalf of his children thereafter born to him during marriage.\nWhere the title deed of a purchaser of lands bears upon its face recitals which would have led upon inquiry to evidence of the defeasibility of his vendor's title, he must be presumed to have been aware of the precarious nature of the title he was purchasing and prescriptive title cannot afterwards be invoked either by him or those in possession under him as holders in good faith under transitory title.\nAs good faith is required for the ten years prescription under the Civil Code, that prescription cannot be invoked against a substitution which has been duly registered, such registration being sufficient to constitute any third party, who might subsequently Purchase from the institute a holder in bad faith. Appeal from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, (appeal side) ([1]), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which dismissed the plaintiffs action with costs.\nA statement of the case appears in the judgment reported.\nBeique Q.C. and .J. E Martin for the appellants. The donation had in view the marriage of the donee and the future condition of the wife and children especially the establishment in life of the latter. The donor and donee intended to create what is known as u une institution contractuelle ou (d'h\u00e9r\u00e9dite.\" The deed was published and duly insinuated in 1832 and registered immediately after the institution of lands registration offices in the Montreal District in 1844, and Meloche, junior, accepted the donation to him as institute and entered into possession of the lands imm\u00e9diate after the execution of the deed of donation He married within six months of the date of the deed of donation and referred to it as his title to the lands in his marriage contract. He continued in possession until 1850, when the first deed was revoked and the new deed executed in favour of himself and his wife. See 1 Bourjon 189. The second deed was registered but never was published or insinuated as required for donations, up to the year 1855. See Macintosh v. Bell ([2]). The deed to Sir George Simpson, in 1854, also registered, refers to the second deed as the vendor's title and the purchaser is charged with both actual and constructive notice of the existence of the undercharged substitution in favour of the appellants, the donor's grand children, under the deed of 1832. The defence of prescription must consequently fail as the respondents are affected by notice of the precarious title of the vendor and must be held to be in bad faith when claiming a superior title. Prescription did not run before the death of the institute in 1886 Art 2207 C. C. See Duplessis, \u0153uvres, vol. 1 pp. 490 521-523; Pothier Prescription no. 34; 32 Laurent nn. 406, 410, 414; Le Roux de Bretagne, vol. 2 p. 107, no. 926; S. V. 27, 2, 181; Dalloz, 1888, 1, 130; 2 Troplong 921; 21 Duranton, 386; v. Brown ([3]); Baudry-Lacantinerie, Prescription n. 61; 2Aubry & Rau, nn. 213-218. Prescription does not run against a claim dependent upon a condition before the happening of that condition, Arts. 2236, 2237, C. C.; Gilbert sur Sirey Art. 2257 nos. 1 and 2; 21 Duranton, 279. We also refer to Aubry & Rau, Vol. 2, p, 327, note 1 p. 367 sec. 215 his and p. 385, note 30; Page v. McLennan ([4]) Dorion v. Dorion ([5]); Symes v. Cuvillier ([6]), and authorities cited at page 389 of Beauchamp's Jurisprudence of the Privy Council.\nAs to the revocation of the substitution it must be borne in mind that the present substitution was created by an ascendant with a view to marriage in favour of the institute and his children to be born the acceptance being made by the institute as well for himself as for his said children. Arts. 772, 788, 790 and 930 C. C. declare such an acceptation for children to be born to be perfect, and the substitution irrevocable, and merely consecrate the previous existing law. Herse v. Defaux ([7]); Stewart v. Molson's Bank ([8]); Smith v. Davis ([9]); Beautieu v. Hayward ([10]); Joubert v. Walsh ([11])\nGeoffrion Q. C, and Fleet for the respondents. The respondents are holders under translator title in good faith and had acquired the prescription of ten years prior to the action and subsequent to the attainment of the age of majority by all the substitutes. The onus of proving bad faith is upon plaintiffs; art. 202 C. C. and such bad faith must have existed at the date of the purchase; art. 2253 C. C. The appellants must show that Sir George Simpson at the time of the acquisition by him of the property was aware not only of the precise terms and legal effect of the deed of donation of the 11th January, 1850, but of the precise terms and legal effect of the deed of the 15th August 1832. There is no proof that Sir George Simpson had knowledge of the existence of this deed at the time of his acquisition of the property on the 2nd September, 1854. Even supposing he had knowledge of such deed when he purchased the islands, there is nothing in the terms of the deed to show what the terms of the substitution referred to were, in whose favour it was created or whether there was at the time an existing substitution or not. Knowledge of the terms of the substitution acquired during the occupation of Sir George Simpson, even if proved, would not have availed appellants, for, by arts. 2251 and 2253 C. C. it is not ten years possession in good faith that is required but acquisition in good faith followed by ten years possession, and this is so, whether the law applicable to the present case is to be governed by the code or by the law anterior thereto, for art. 2253 C. C. is old law in force before the Code. The defendants as universal legatees of their father under the same title continued his pos-session and good faith. Art. 2200 C. C.; 32 Laurent 361.\nThe youngest appellant became of age in 1874; the action was instituted in 1893 and the respondents and their father had been in possession under translator title in good faith, since the 2nd September, 1854. This possession is effective and avails as investing them with a prescriptive title in virtue of arts. 2206 and 2251 C. C. True, the substitution only opened in 1886, but the ten years' prescription runs against substitutes before the opening of the substitution.\u2014Arts. 2207, 2270, C. C. This was also the law before the code : Ricard, Substitutions, 3 0. 13 pt. 2, nos. 92 and 93, referred to in Thevenot d'Essaule, (\u00e9d. Mathieu) no. 886; Domat, Lois Civiles, Liv. 5, tit. 4 S. 3, nos. 13 and 14,p 526 But as it does not appear that prescription commenced under the old law, the prescription of ten years as regulated by the Code must apply.\nThe law determining whether the revocation is valid, is without doubt that existing in the years 1832 and 1850 and art 930 C. C, in so far at least as respects the revocability of substitutions, is a departure from the principles as laid down under the old law. The codifiers intended to introduce such new law and the article, in its present form, embodies the amendments proposed by the codifiers, and is the second draft prepared by them. In the first report (p. 280) they state that the suggested amendments are made with the view of introducing uniformity with reference to the rules relating to the acceptability and irrevocability of substitutions. See Beaulieu v. Hayward ([12]); Wood v. Blondin ([13]); Hutchinson v. Gillespie ([14]); Les S\u0153urs Hospitali\u00e8res de St. Joseph v. ([15]); and Symes v. Cuvillier ([16]); and it was held, in Symss v. Cuvillier (1) that the Ordonnance des Donations of 1731 Was never in force in Lower Canada, never having been registered. It was so decided in Joubert v. Walsh ([17]); Jones v. Cuthbert ([18]); and Caty v. Perrault ([19]). We also refer generally to Pothier (ed. Bugnet) vol. 8, p. 514, no. 174; Thouin v. Leblanc ([20]), at page 372 n. and the cases there cited also to S. V.1845, 1241 as to the question of good faith.\nThe rights of the parties in the present case are governed by the law in force in this province in the years 1832 and 1850, the years respectively in which the deed of donation invoked by appellants was executed and was revoked, being the law of France prior to the ordonnance of 1747 and under that law the donation of 1832 was validly revoked by the donation of 1850.\nThe judgement of the court was delivered by :\nTaschereau J\u2014The revocation forty-nine years ago of a fiduciary substitution created sixty-seven years ago by a deed of donation gave rise to the present litigation.\nThe principal point of law in controversy upon this appeal has been definitely settled for more than thirty years by the Civil Code of the province. It is therefore probably the last time that it will ever be brought up before a court of justice. Then the property in dispute, according to what the tenant in possession said of it at the trial, does not appear to be of very considerable value. I have nevertheless given to the case a great deal of consideration. It is a very interesting one indeed, and I have spent many pleasant hours over it. The facts are simple. On the 15th of August, 1832, one J. B. Meloche (et uxor) conveyed by deed of donation a certain property to his son. J.B. Meloche, junior, then unmarried, a party to the said deed and accepting said donation for himself, his heirs and assigns, with express stipulation that the said donee was to have but a life estate in the property, and with charge of fiduciary substitution in favour of his male children or any one of them at his election \" the donors divesting, themselves of their right of ownership in favour of their said grandchildren.\"\nA few months later the said Meloche junior married. Eighteen years later, on the 11th of January, 1850, he and his father agreed to revoke the substitution created by the said donation of 1832, thereby giving him the full ownership of the property, of which he was since then in possession instead of a mere life estate that he previously had. for that purpose they went through the form of revoking the deed of 1832, and of executing a new deed of donation without the substitution proviso; but, immaterial though it be, in my opinion this was nothing but a simulation and a subterfuge. It was merely the substitution that was revoked, and that was intended to be revoked.\nSubsequently, in 1854, the donee, Meloche, junior, sold this property to the late Sir George Simpson.\nThe appellants, the donee's children, alleging their father's death in 1886 their renunciation to his succession and the due publication and registration of the deed of 1832, now claim the property from the representatives of Sir George Simpson.\nThe only question upon this appeal, besides a plea of prescription which I will consider later on, is whether the aforesaid revocation of that substitution in 1850 was lawful or not. If not, the sale by Meloche to Sir George Simpson stands dissolved in law by Meloche's death, and the appellants are entitled to the property. Huc Code Civil, vol, 6, nos. 416, 418. In another form the question is, whether the law on this point before the Code was the same as it is now under Art. 930 thereof. For it is conceded that if the case were governed by the Code, the appellants would be entitled to the property.\nCounsel on both sides have diligently elaborated the question and have given us invaluable assistance in the researches they have made. I have delved with them into the ancient law. I have examined every one of their quotations Charondas, Auzanet, Lebrun, 1icard, Furgole, D'Aguesseau, Ferri\u00e8re, Theve-not, Pothier, and others. I find that in not many of them is the precise point in controversy here considered; that is, whether in a deed of this nature, the acceptance by a father for himself constitutes an acceptance by the substitutes. The distinction between the case where the substitutes are the children of the institute as the appellants are here, and the case where the substitutes are not his children appears to have often been lost sight of by the commentators. Yet, it is a very important one. The code impliedly recognises it by restricting the irrevocability to the substitutions that are created in favour of the children of the institute. Thevenot for instance pages 57, 385, 448, invoked by the respondents, does not notice this distinction. The controversy had no actuality when he wrote, as it had then definitively been settled in France by the Ordonnance of 1747. He simply states what the law was previously according to Ricard, without reasoning the question. But Ricard has given two diametrically opposed opinions on the subject. Vol. 1 pp. 193-4; vol. 2 pp. 278-9. He is said by Thevenot himself in his preface, to be a writer \"who has often wandered away from the true principles.\" He certainly must have wandered away once upon this question. Merlin, Rep. v. revoc. de substit., cites in support of the proposition that the ordonnance had introduced a change in the law in this respect, the works of Charondas, vol. 2, page 523, r\u00e9ponse XCII. Now the case there quoted does not touch the point at all. It appears to have been determined on the ground either that there was no substitution in the deed there under consideration or that the substitution, if any, had lapsed by the death of the donee before the donor. And in his commentary on the Coutume de Paris, page 195, this same Charondas says that, in his opinion, if a done accept a donation for himself with charge to deliver it over on the happening of a certain event to a third person not a party to the deed, the donation to this third party is irrevocable,\net me semble que le donateur et le donataire ne peuvent infirmer telle donation au pr\u00e9judice de celui qui est d\u00e9nomm\u00e9 en la condition.\nMoreover this opinion in Merlin is especially given as the law applicable to Provence, where the ordonnance had not been registered. Yet Lebret, the president of the parliament of Provence itself its Chief Justice or Lord Chancellor, I might call him, and Decormis, a celebrated member thereof, are both of opinion, in answer to D'Aguesseau's questions, page 42, that such. substitutions were always irrevocable. And Montval lon des Succ. vol. 2, page 105, an eminent commentator upon the laws of this same parliament of Provence, says :\nThe ordonnance of 1747 is in conformity with our jurisprudence as to the irrevocability of substitutions created by donations inter vivos.\nDomat lois civiles tit. X, sec. 1, part VI, has been cited to prove the undeniable proposition that donations are revocable with the donee's consent. Certainly, Meloche senior had the right to revoke the donation to his son with, his son's consent. But that is not at all the donation in dispute here. What is controverted, and all that is controverted by the appellants is the donor's right to revoke without their consent not the donation made to their father but the donation made to themselves either with or without their father's consent.\nFurgole, Donat. vol. 1, page 93, vol. 2, pages 39 to 48, Substit. page 47 who also would appear to admit the right of revoking such a substitution, though not very clearly, writes under the law of the parliament of Toulouse, a parliament de droit \u00e9crit, whilst Bourjon, dr. comm. de Ia France, vol. 2, page 125, par. XXXVI et seq., who supports the doctrine of irrevocability, wrties before the ordonnance, under the Coutume de Paris, the law of the province of Quebec. So does Lebrun des Succ, part 2, page 30, no. 45, who, noticing the distinction 1 have alluded to is of opinion that such a substitution when in favour of the children of the institute is irrevocable.\nTerrasson, a celebrated lawyer, in vol. 2 of Claude Henri's works (Nouvelles Observation page 175) puts the question under the Coutume de Paris and answers.\nAt first sight it would seem that the acceptance by the first donee is not an acceptance \"by the substitute; however, in law it is so.\nAnd Rousseau de Lacombe, rec. de jurisp. v. substit page 688, sec. V. no. 5, says;\nFid\u00e9icommis par donation entrevifs accept\u00e9e par le donataire est irr\u00e9vocable\nand in his commentaires sur les nouvelles ordonnances, p. 57,\ndonataire charg\u00e9 de substitution, qui par son acceptation a rendu la donation irr\u00e9vocable aussi bien en sa faveur qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des substitu\u00e9s\nI do not see, however, the usefulness of continuing here the review of the commentators. It would merely further prove to no purpose whatever, that, as stated by D'Agusseau, Ferri\u00e8re, Pothier and others, for a long time in France before the Or'donnance of 1747, there had existed a great diversity of opinions on the subject. And to count them would not do. Ponde-rantur, non numerantur. That is, no doubt, what was done by the eminent lawyers who were entrusted with the task of codifying the laws of the Province of Quebec, when they adopted in art. 930 of the Code, as pre-existing law, the doctrine of the irrevocability of such substitutions. And behind their determination of the question, principally based, it may well be assumed, on the opinion of the majority of the members of the parliament of Paris, then the highest Court of Justice in France, given in answer to the questions put by D'Aguesseau, we should not under the circum-stances go.\nIt has been questioned if the codifiers really intended to draft this part of art. 930 as pre-existing law. But I do not see that there can be the least room for doubt about it. They were specially required by 29 Vict. ch. 41, to carefully distinguish in the Code, as it was to be printed for promulgation, the new law from the old law. In conformity with that enactment they reported that m the edition so officially printed they had inserted the new law between brackets. And the irrevocability of substitutions in favour of the children of the institute is not between brackets. It is designedly left out of the brackets immediately preceding it though it had been unnoticed in the article first drafted as pre-existing law. Then, in their report they state unequivocally that it is only as regards the acceptance of such substitutions inter vivos subsequent to the deed (by persons able to accept of course, and when they are not the children of the institute), that they suggest an amendment. Some writers contended that, as it was then for donations, it was likewise only in express terms and in the deed itself or in a subsequent deed to which the donor was a party, (art. 181 of the codifiers report), that the acceptance of any substitution created thereby when required could be awfully agreed to. But the codifies, having by art. 788 introduced a change in the law concerning donations as to this, suggested that the same rule should thereafter apply to the substitutions that have to be accepted by the substitutes, meaning clearly the substitutions where the substitutes are not the children of the institute. The legislature adopted their suggestion, and that is the only change that the article contains and purports to contain. The rest of it (not between brackets) is to be taken as declaratory law, as was done for other articles of the same Code in the two cases in the Privy Council of Wardle v. Bethune ([21]), and Herse v. Dufaux ([22]). Upon that ground alone, I would be opinion that this appeal should be allowed. For were I at liberty to do so, I would hesitate before holding that the codifies have fallen into error upon a point that the learned D'Aguesseau, after the most elaborate consideration ever bestowed upon it, could not but report as doubtful. Pothier. . Oblig. No. 73. Pothier, Substit. sec. 1, arts. 1 and 2; D'Aguesseau, Questions p. 531. To use the words of Mr. Justice Hall, in Stewart v. Molsons Bank ([23]).\nAny attempt to go back of the promulgation of the Code and to establish an error or misconception, or even an omission, on the part of the codifies as the basis of a judgment at variance with the accepted text of the Code, I consider unwarranted, unnecessary and dangerous in the extreme.\nOr as Mr. Justice Blanchet said in the same case :\nThe learned \"judges who framed the Code having reported it to have-been previously the law (by simply not inserting the article between brackets) that movables could be substituted, and. the legislature having adopted their report, all doubts that existed upon the question should be considered as forever removed.\nThese observations upon Art. 981 concurred in unanimously by the Court of Appeal in that case, have their full application upon art. 930 in this case. It might be argued that, by enacting the irrevocability of such substitutions, the ordonnance of 1747 implied that they were previously revocable. But that argument cannot apply to these ordonnances of 1731 and 1747. It is conceded in all the books that they were, with not many exceptions, nothing but a consolidation of the previous law on donations and substitutions. Art. xi for instance of 1731 and art. xii of 1747, cannot be, and are nowhere regarded as, changes in the law. The same may be said, to cite a few more instances of arts, xxvii xxviii, xxix, xxxi to xxxv of 1747 and likewise, according to the Parliament of Paris, and of the majority of commentators, of art. xi of 1747 by which the doctrine of the irrevocability of substitutions stipulated in deeds inter vivos is authoritatively affirmed.\nThen upon principle, assuming the question to be res integra I would hold such substitutions to be irrevocable. As a general rule, no doubt, a stipulation in an ordinary contract for the benefit of a third person may be revoked so long as it has not been accepted. But that can have a reasonable application only where there exists as a matter of fact such a person. Art. 1029 C. C And the substitution in this donation inter vivos is not a mere stipulation of that kind; it is a. direct donation to the substitutes the donor or grantor, to use the very terms of this deed itself, divesting himself of his ownership in favour of the substitutes, whose acceptance was out of the question since they were then unborn. Their father was to have it first as long as he lived, but, subject to that reservation, the donation to them is as full and ample as it could be. De Lauri\u00e8re des instit. et substit. vol. 2, pp. 128, 134,136, et seq. And what shows that this is not an ' ordinary contract, nor one to which all the rules applying to ordinary contracts can be extended, is that this donation in the form of a substitution was lawfully made, it is conceded, to persons not yet born. Art. 929 C. C. Such a substitution exists as a factitious being as soon as the deed is executed, though there is yet not a single substitutes in existence. Then, art 303 authorises the father to accept a donation for his minor child and that donation is irrevocable even with the father's consent. Compare arts. 772, 778, 789, 818, 823 C. C. And under art. 790 C. C., if one of the appellants had beer born when the donation of 1832 was made, the acceptance for him, if a minor, by his father the institute would have constituted an acceptance for all the others not yet born. All of these special privileges and safeguards that attach to them are characteristic features of donations in favour of children or grandchildren that distinguish them from ordinary contracts. And the law recognises that substitutes, or the legal entity called the substitution, when the substitutes are not yet born, under a donation inter vivos have some rights even before the opening. It cannot be denied that they or the substitution for them before they are born, have an interest in the property. Art. 945 C. C. for instance (as at first in the code) provided for a curator to protect their interests. Art. 956 C. C. empowers the curator to perform all acts of a conservatory nature whether against the institute or against third persons. Art. 2207 C. C. gives an action to interrupt any prescription that may run against them. These provisions clearly imply that they have an interest in the property, though that interest be conditional and in suspense. And that being so the law would be irrational if it allowed to the donor the right to deprive them of that interest at his mere will and caprice, when they are themselves unable to act.\nThe respondents' case, it seems to me, rests on a fallacy. They argue that this substitution of 1832 and the donation to the appellants it imports could be revoked so long as it had not been accepted, and it had not been accepted, they say, when it was revoked. Now that is not so. It was, in law, accepted by the deed of 1832, in peroon\u00ea donatarrii their father s acceptance for himself constituted in law an acceptance of the donation to themselves. That is what art. 930 impliedly says, and declares to have always been the law of the province. Bourjon, dr. comm. de la France,. vol. 2, page 125, par. xxxvi. Guyot, v. Donation, 4me. partie, page 172. And that law is consistent wih the fundamental principles of donations inter vivos, which under pain of nullity, cannot be revocable at the donor's will. Art. 783. Then would the law be reasonable if on the one hand it allowed, as it unmistakably does, donations by way of substitution to children not yet born, yet on the other hand, it left them, as contended for by the respondents, at the mercy of the grantor? It is for the protection of unborn children and of future generations and to protect and allow of the Creation of family estates that such substitutions by deed inter vivos are authorised and favoured by the law; it is for that purpose, and because of their nature, that they must be deemed to be irrevocable by the donor. For I do not see, when the donation to him is not affected, that the donee's consent could be required to rescind the substitution, if it could be rescinded at all. He thereby would, get the property free from the substitution. The last part. of art. 930 protects him; the revocation, if lawful, would inure to his benefit. So that the respondents are driven to contend that this donor by himself alone had the right to revoke the substitution as long as he left the donation to his son intact, as he has virtually done. I fail to see upon what principle the consent of his son, the donee could at all make the revocation of the substitution lawful, if it could not be lawfully made by the donor alone.\nAnother view of the question strikes me, assuming airain that art. xi. of the Ordonnance and this part of art. 930 of the Code may not be considered as enactments of a declaratory character. After hearing the reasons and opinions for and against the doctrine of irrevocability of the most learned men in France of that time, Chancellor d'Aguesseau came to the conclusion that the doctrine of irrevocability was the soundest, the most rational, the most equitable one. And to render it incontrovertible and remove the doubts that had been cast upon it, he drafted art. xi. of the Ordonnance of 1747. The Ordonnance of 1731 had merely declared these substitutions to be lawful as they had always been held to be, without, however, express mention of their irrevocability. Then, the distinguished judges who framed this art. 930 of the Quebec Code have adopted the same view of the question when the substitutes are the children of the institute. Further, at the present day in France, though the Code Napoleon has not reproduced art. xi of the Ordonnance of 1747, it is considered that, upon principle and from their character, such substitutions must be deemed irrevocable by lawyers of such eminence as Favard (Rep. subst., page 321, par. xx); Toullier, vol 3, ed. BeIge, no. 731; Zachariae (vol 3, page 130, par. 696); Demolombe, vol. xxii, 5 Donat., no. 442; Duranton, vol. 9, no. 550; Boileux, vol. 4, page 206; Aubry et Rau, vol. 7, par. 696 page 337; Laurent, vol. 14, nos. 581, 583, 585; Coin Delisle, Donats. et Tests., page 534, no. 44; Mar-cad\u00e9 vol. 4 no. 221; Michaux, Testaments, no. 1504; and the learned, editors of the Pandectes Francaises, rep. v. Donat. et Test., nos. 10668, 10669, 10855. The respondents would ask us to determine here that all of these opinions are erroneous. I will not assume that responsibility.\nThere is another reason in favour of the doctrine of irrevocability which, though perhaps not conclusive by itself, yet adds force to it here, it seems to me, as applicable to the actual facts of this case. It is undoubted law that a substitution rnade in a contact of marriage is irrevocable. Arts. 772, 930, 1257 C. 0. That is so upon the principle that marriages and procreation should be favoured and encouraged De Lauri\u00e8re des instit. et substit. vol. 2 page 151. Now here the substitution, though not contained in a contract of marriage, was nevertheless evidently stipulated in view of the donee's marriage, which did actually take place within six months thereafter as it is a substitution in favour of his children, and the donation is moreover subject to the express condition that he will not hypothecate the property for the dower of his future wife. That being so, assuming the question to be still a doubtful one as it was before the Code, which is all that the respondents can possibly contend for, is it not reasonable to apply the rule ubi eadem ratio ibi idem jus, and give the benefit of the doubt, if any doubt remained, to a substitution so evidently created in favour of marriage? Arr\u00e9ts de Louet vol. 1, sommaire 51, lett. D., page 564. Is it not in fact as clearly a donation in favour of the donee's marriage as if it had been inserted in the donee's contract of marriage itself? And that being so, should we not extend to the children issued of that marriage, the protection that the law aims at for them, though in form the deed might not be the necessary one to generally insure the incontrovertible irrevocability of such a substitution? I must not be understood as saying that a donation such as this one is equivalent to an institution contractuelle by a contract of marriage. All 1 say is that, assuming the question to be a doubtful one, unfettered by authority as we are, the rule of the institution conlractuelle should be applied where the reason for that rule has full application.\nA decision in that sense of1596 is noted in Despeisses, vol. 1, page 429, in a case where a donation made four months before the marriage was held to be valid. and irrevocable though at that time such donations were lawful only when made causa dotis et propter nuptias, D'Olive, p. 521, because it had been made in view of the future marriage, quia matrimonies erat causa finalis.\nA woman, to suppose a very possible case, is induced to marry such a donee on the faith of the donation to him and of the substitution in favour of their children. If later on her husband, forgetful of his duties, casts her away with the children, she need not fear that her father-in-law either alone or with the connivance of her husband will revoke the substitution and deprive the children of the substituted property. The law protects them by refusing to the donor the right to do so; and he the donor, knew at the time he made it that such a grant to his grandchildren would be irrevocable; the law told him so. But if the respondents' theory were to prevail, the donor would ad nutum have the right to revoke this grant at any time before the donee's death and take away the property from these children. Here again, the reason for the doctrine of irrevocability seems to me much stronger than anything that can be said by its adversaries\nAn isolated case of 1770 (Tattering) quoted in 4 Ancien Denisart, page 388, but of which no authentic report has been referred to at bar is invoked by the respondents in support of their contention. That decision however does not seem to he entitled to much consideration. It is ignored or left unnoticed by every one of the numerous subsequent writers we have been referred to. D\u00e9nisart himself cannot have reported it for he had died in 1765 five years before the date given to it. Then it appears to have been a decision upon the appeal of a judgment by default given by the Garonne Court under the Coutume de Peronne probably, Costumier G\u00e9n\u00e9rall vol. 2, p. 593, but which court gave that judgment in appeal, I have not been able to find out. It is certainly not the Parliament of Paris then the highest Court of Appeal in France. Such a case carries no weight and cannot preponderate against the reasoning and authorities that support the doctrine of irrevocability.\nI would be of opinion that the appellants are entitled to judgment on that point.\nThis does not dispose of the whole case however. Have not the appellants lost their rights by the ten years prescription which has been pleaded by the respondents s\nI am of opinion that here again the appellants' contention should prevail. There is, it seems to me, hardly anything to be added on this point to what was said in the Court of Appeal, which was against the respondents on this plea The new enactment in art 2207 did it apply, that prescription runs before the opening, cannot be extended to the ten years' prescription. One of the essential elements of that prescription is good faith. And the knowledge of another one's right is in law bad faith. Troplong, Prescr. nos. 915, 926. Now the insinuation and publication of this substitution was notice of it to the world. The purchaser of such a property from the institute is in law presumed to have been personally aware at the time of the purchase and ever since that his vendor had none but a defeasible title. Ignorantia juris non excusat. 2. Troplong, no. 926; 7 Boileux, page 843. The case presents itself precisely as if it had been in the deed of sale to Sir George Simpson that Meloche senior had intervened to revoke the substitution. In his commentary on prescription, Pothier says no 1411\nLes droits de substitution ne sont pas sujets a cette prescription lorsque la substitution a \u00e9t\u00e9 duement publi\u00e9e et iusinu\u00e9e.\nAnd in Oeuvres de Cochin vol. 6 pages 13 and 14 in the same sense, it is said by that great lawyer :\nLes tiers acqu\u00e9reuss ne peuvent prescrire par dix ans entre pr\u00e9sens et vingt ans entre absens Ia substitution \u00e9tant connue par la publication qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, les acqu\u00e9reuss et d\u00e9tenteurs sont n\u00e9cessairement en mauvaise foi.\nBretonnier (sur Henrys) vol. 2, page 245, also says :\nPour ce qui est de la prescription de dix et vingt ans, ii est certain que les acqu\u00e9reuss de biens substitu\u00e9s ne peuvent pas l'opposer au fid\u00e9icommissaire\nAnd Rousseau de Lacombe, page 511 :\nQuant aux immeubles l'acquereur ne peut opposer la prescription de 10 et 20 ans au fid\u00e9icommissaire\nIt is upon that principle that the sheriff's sale does not discharge the substitution, art. 710 C. C. P , if it had been duly insinuated and published (now registered since 1855,18 Vict. ch. 101), because the purchaser is presumed to have known of the substitution. Theve-not page 282, nos. 870 871; Pothier, substit, sec. 5, art. 3; de H\u00e9ricourt vente des immeubles 48 Pothier proc. civ. 257. Les lois ont voulu que ceux qui acquierraient ce bien (un bien sub stitu\u00e9) ne puissent en prescrire ni en purger la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 contre les appeles.\n1er. pigeau, 720.\nThe effect of such publication (said C. J. Sir A. A. Dorion, for the ' court in Blumer v. Dufresne ([24]), is a notice to all the world of the limited right of the institute in the property of which he has only a life interest, and of the reversionary interest of the substitutes. And all parties are by law deemed to have acquired a knowledge of a duly published substitution, and this forms a presumption juris et de jure which cannot be controverted by any evidence to the contrary In the present case. Dufresne the institute) had no right to sell the property itself, and the appellants are by law presumed to have known it.\nAnd in the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal in that case it is held that :\nVu la publication et enregistrement du dit testament les appelants, lorsqu'ils ont achet\u00e9 le sable en question \u00e9taient cens\u00e9s conna\u00eetre la substitution v contenue et savoir que le dit Jean Baptiste Dufresne n'avait aucun droit de vendre ce sable.\nThat case came to this court but is not to be found in our reports. A note of it in Cassels's Digest, ([25]), is to \u00a1me unintelligible. There was no plea of prescription in the case (necessary for the prescription mentioned) and not a word of it in the judgments either of the Superior Court ([26]), or of the Court of Appeal (1) nor, as I have ascertained, in the record sent up to this court. However, the holding given in Cassels that publication of the substitution in that case was not sufficient notice to put third parties on their guard must be assumed to have been based on the same reasons as those that were given by the judges whose opinions are reported (loc. cit.) and that was simply because publication, though notice of the substitutes' title to the realty is not a notice that affects personality, or, as it was in that case, the purchase of sand removed from the land Here it is the title to the property that is in dispute, and Sir George Simpson must be presumed to have known that it was a substituted property that he bought from the institute.\nIt is for the very purpose of making it known to every one dealing with the institute that he has but a life estate in the property; Thevenot, pages 233, 243, 504; Demolombe, 5 Donats, no. 555; that these formalities were prescribed.\nI would on this ground hold that the respondents' plea of prescription by ten years must be dismissed. But even if the insinuation and publication were not in law notice to Sir George Simpson of the substitution I lo not see how it can be contended that he was personally unaware of it when it is expressly referred to in the deed of 1850 which his vendor represents to him in the deed of sale of 1854 as his own title to the property It is true that it is by that same deed of 1850 that the substitution was revoked but Sir George Simpson must be assumed to have known that such a revocation was unlawful and ineffectual. Troplong, prescr. no. 930. Marcad\u00e9, prescr. page 200, par. IV; Leroux de Bretagne, nos. 909, 927; 32 Laurent, 408; Guyot, Prescr. pages 315,342.\nThe learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench was of opinion that this plea of prescription should be dismissed on the ground that the necessary ten years had not accrued under the law anterior to the code that in his opinion governs this case. I cannot make out by the record whether it is on that ground or on the ground of bad faith taken by Mr. Justice Blanchet that the judgment of the court unanimously dismissing the plea is based. However, though unnecessary for me to go further I do not wish to be understood as holding that the ten years had accrued. On the contrary, the reasoning of the Chief Justice seems to me unanswerable. I cannot see that a law passed in 1866 could apply to a contract passed in 1832, or in 1854, without being retroactive.\nI would allow the appeal with costs and order judgment to be entered for the appellants in conformity with the conclusions of their declaration. That is the unanimous judgment of the court.\nAppeal allowed with costs *\nSolicitors for the appellants; Foster, Martin & Girouard.\nSolicitors for the respondents : Robertson, Fleet & Falconer.\n*an application to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for leave to appeal from this judgment was refused.\n[1] Q .

In an action by his widow for the amount of his benefit certificate it was claimed that the forfeiture was waived.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that the waiver not having been pleaded it could not be relied on as an answer to the plea of non-payment. Allen v. Merchants Marine Ins. Co. (15 Can. S.C.R. 488) followed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming, by an equal division of the court, the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff. The respondent is the widow of the late Asa E. Hilliker, who, on the 11th day of December, 1894, applied for membership into plaintiff\u2019s Order in Norwich Tent, no. 143, located at the Village of Norwich, in the Province of Ontario, and was duly admitted a member on the 31st day of December, 1894; and the benefit certificate sued on in this action for the sum of $3,000 payable to the respondent in case of the death of her husband was then issued by the appellants on that day. Asa E. Hilliker on the 21st of August, 1895, was killed by a railway train near the Village of Norwich. At the time of his death Hilliker was suspended under the rules of the society for non-payment of two assessments and to the respondent\u2019s action on the benefit certificate this suspension was pleaded and also misrepresentation in the application for membership, it being alleged that deceased was of intemperate habits, though in his answers to questions in said application he had stated that he never used intoxicating liquors to excess and had not been intoxicated during the preceding year.\nOn the trial a non-suit was refused and the jury gave a verdict for plaintiff finding in answer to questions submitted that there had been no misrepresentation as alleged. On appeal to the Court of Appeal the verdict was sustained by an equal division of the judges.\nThe non-payment of assessments was admitted by respondent who maintained, however, that the consequent forfeiture had been waived by the society.\nPaterson for the appellant referred to Fitzrandolph v. Mutual Relief Society of Nova Scotia[1]; Venner v. Sun Life Ins. Co.[2]; Peet v. Knights of Macabees[3]. Ball Q.C. and Ball for the respondent cited Thomson v. Weems[4]; Gravel v. L\u2019Union St. Thomas[5].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGIROUARD J.\u2014This case is a simple one of life insurance. At the argument, however, the respondent has complicated it by raising numerous questions which do not come up under the issue between the parties.\nThe appellants are a friendly or benefit association, duly incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario, with power to issue benefit certificates to its members. There is a General or Supreme Tent, which is the governing body, and there are subordinate tents, which are called the local tents. On the 11th of December, 1894, Asa E. Hilliker, cattle drover, applied for membership to the local tent, known as Norwich Tent. No. 143, located at the Village of Norwich, in the Province of Ontario, and was duly admitted a member on the 31st December, 1894, and a benefit certificate for the sum of $3,000 payable to his wife, the respondent, in case of his death, was then issued by the appellants.\nOn the 21st of August, 1895, Asa E. Hilliker was killed by a railway train near the village of Norwich. Hence the present action by the respondent against the appellants, in which she alleges:\n5. The said Asa E. Hilliker was assessed by the defendants for the said insurance at the rate of fifty cents per thousand dollars per month, and also some months a double assessment was made by the defendants, all of which assessments were regularly and duly paid, as well as his entrance fees, by the said Asa E. Hilliker to the proper officer appointed by the defendants to receive the same, except the last assessment, which was not due and payable until after the death of the said Asa E. Hilliker.\nThe appellants pleaded: 1st. Misrepresentation by deceased in his application for membership as to his drinking habits. 2nd. Non-payment of dues and assessments, and more particularly of the double assessment Nos. 114 and 115, due May, 1895, monthly assessment No. 116, due June, 1895, and monthly assessment No. 117, due July, 1895.\nThe case was tried at Woodstock on the 22nd of March, 1897, before Chancellor Boyd and a jury. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the defendants moved for a non-suit, but the learned Chancellor refused the motion and allowed the case to go to the jury, who returned a general verdict against the appellants for the full amount of the certificate. Judgment was accordingly entered against them for $3,000 and costs.\nIn appeal, the case was heard before four judges, who were equally divided, Burton C.J. and Maclennan J. being in favour of the appellants, and Moss and Osler JJ. against.\nThe evidence is contradictory as to the drinking habits of the deceased at the time of his application, and the non-payment of the double assessments Nos. 114 and 115, and we may fairly accept the findings of the jury in these particulars. But there is no dispute as to the non\u2011payment of the monthly assessments Nos. 116 and 117; they were payable at fixed dates under the regulations of the association (Rule 182) which form part of the certificate and provide that\nany member failing to pay the monthly assessment within thirty days from the date thereof shall stand suspended from all the rights and benefits of a beneficial member of the order.\nThe non-payment of these two monthly assessments is admitted by the respondent in her evidence; the most she can say is that her husband paid no. 116, but she did not see him do it. She admits that no. 117 was not paid. All the witnesses, who are in a position to know, agree that these two monthly assessments were not paid, and the fact is even conceded by the respondent\u2019s counsel, both in his factum and at the hearing before us. He endeavours to meet the plea of non-payment of these two monthly assessments by alleging various facts and circumstances which, if well founded, would amount to a waiver of forfeiture of the certificate, for instance, that no notice of the call of said assessments was given; that at all events the deceased was entitled to a notice that he was in arrears; that he had been illegally suspended for non-payment of assessments; and finally that the local Tent of Norwich was suspended from June 1st to August 5th, and that in consequence it was impossible for him to make any payment. Mr. Justice Maclennan, in his elaborate opinion, clearly demonstrates that all these excuses are without foundation, and I have no hesitation in agreeing with him. But the judgment of this court is based upon another ground, namely that the facts and circumstances which are invoked as grounds of waiver of forfeiture of the certificate should have been pleaded by the respondent. The reason why the last assessment, probably no. 118, and clearly that due 1st to 31st August, was not paid, is set forth in the statement of claim, but nothing more. There is no such issue raised on the record as the one pressed by the respondent\u2019s counsel; and following the decision of this court in Allen v. The Merchant\u2019s Marine Ins. Co.[6], we are of opinion that the appeal must be allowed. The motion for a non-suit is therefore granted and respondent\u2019s action dismissed with costs before all the courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Kerr, McDonald, Davidson & Paterson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ball & Ball.\n[1] 17 Can.

Perrault v. Gauthier et al. (28 Can. S. C. R. 241) referred to.\nThe Chief Justice dissented.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, (appeal side), affirming a judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which maintained a demurrer filed by the defendant and dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs.\nA statement of the case will be found in the judgment of the majority of the court delivered by Mr. Justice Girouard.\nTrenholme Q.C. and Gilman Q.C. for the appellants. The statutes which enabled the corporation to institute the expropriation proceedings must be construed as a contract authorizing dealings with private lands and the customary clauses as to indemnity to the owners must be supplied as a matter of course. See arts 407 1017 1589 1591 C.C art. 903 Mun. Code, Que.; sec. 11, \"Town Corporation General Clauses Act;\" C S L C c 70 s 30 The statute did not authorize the long delays, about twenty years, that the corporation permitted to elapse in this case, leaving clouds on the title through all that period. The owner had no power to force the city to proceed with the extension of the street and is not to blame in any manner for that delay. For the whole period she' had no beneficial use of her property. The taxes she paid on it form part of the damages sustained in consequence of the proceedings taken, so long delayed and finally abandoned; art 1053 C. C.

There is no fault chargeable against the corporation, which merely exercised, in the proceedings taken, not only the power, but the duty as well, provided by the statute, and the appellant is not entitled to any indemnity for the- inconveniences suffered if any either under the Code or under the special statutes relating to the expropriations. The effect of the Acts was merely to create a servitude for purposes of public utility, and the owner was not at any time, during the period in question, deprived of her property ; she continued to use and enjoy it, subject to the restrictions imposed by the statute and to which she was obliged to submit without indemnification. As a matter of fact no real damages have been proved to have been suffered. We refer to Art. 1053 C.

AS I am alone in thinking that this appeal ought to succeed, I do not propose to discuss at length the arguments of the parties, but to state very concisely the reasons and authorities which have led me to concur in the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Blanchet.\nA statutory power such as the respondent undoubtedly had to lay down the proposed line of the new street which had the effect of rendering the -appellants' property for several years unmarketable and unfit to be put to any profitable use, is, we are told, not to be exercised arbitrarily, but with due regard to the interests of landowners In Geddis v Proprietors of Bann Reservoir ([16]), at page 455, Lord Blackburn lays this down very emphatically.\nThe same principle in stated as law and applied to cases like the present, by many American courts. Amongst a great number of these authorities, I may refer to Dillon on Corporations (4 ed ) p. 713 ; The State v. Graves ([17]); Graff v. Ballimore ([18]); Mallard v. Lafayette ([19]) ; In re Roffignac Street ([20]); Mills on Eminent Domain sec. 313. In a note to Dillon at the page cited it is said:\nWhere a Corporation commences proceedings to open a street and notifies the proprietor not to continue the making of improvements he had begun and the Corporation needlessly delays and finally abandons the proceedings, it is under these circumstances liable for the actual damages suffered by the proprietor, arising from the suspension of his improvements.\nFor this statement of the law the learned author refers to the case of McLaughlin v. The Municipality ([21]). And this decision, which is exactly in point with that before us supports the text for which it is cited.\nAlthough I concur with Mr. Justice Blanchet in thinking that the appellant is entitled to a remedy by way of damages, I could not agree with him as to the amount he proposes to award, but that, in the view the majority of the court have taken, is now immaterial\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nGIROUARD J,\u2014In October 1874. the appellant purchased a lot of land, situate on Drummond Street in the City of Montreal, measuring 72 feet 6 inches in. front, by 100 feet in depth and intended to build a large double villa thereon jointly with a friend who was the owner of the adjoining lot of the same size facing on Drummond Street. The services of architects were even retained for the purpose.\nThe same year the legislature of the Province of Quebec granted a new charter, to the City of Mon treal which is known as 37 Vict. oh. 51, and by section 1677 of that Act it is enacted that\nit shall be lawful for the said, corporation at any time, to cause public streets, highways, places and squares within the whole extent of the limits of the said city to be laid out fixed and determined at the city's expense under the direction and supervision of the road committee\nUnder this section a plan or map of the city was made and duly confirmed by the Superior Court, as provided by that statute.\nOn this plan were laid down lines indicating the extension of a street through appellant's lot, known as Burnside Street, from Stanley to Guy Streets ; and later on, at the request of the architects of the appellant and other parties, the city surveyor indicated on the premises, by marks an4 spikes, where the projected prolongation was to go.\nThis course became necessary in face of section 171 of the same Act, which provides that the homologated plan shall be binding upon the corporation and the proprietors who were deprived of their right to any indemnity or damage\nfor any building or improvement whatsoever that the proprietors or other persons whomsoever may have made or caused to be made, after the confirmation of said plan.\nIn consequence, the appellant abandoned the building of her double villa, paid her architects for their plans and labour, and built an ordinary house on the remaining portion of her lot situate at the corner of Drummond Street and the projected Burnside Street, leaving 30 feet front by 100 feet in depth for the projected street vacant, which was afterwards used by her as a garden.\nSeveral statutes were subsequently passed amending the charter of the city or granting a new one in lieu of the former ones, but they have no bearing upon the issue between the parties.\nNothing was done towards the extension of Burn-side Street, appellant paying taxes in the meantime on the vacant land ; but in 1895, after twenty years of complete inaction on both sides the City of Montreal was empowered to abandon the same by 59 Vict. ch. 49, s. 18 :\nIf the proceedings in expropriation for the opening or prolongation of Burnside place or street have not been commenced by the 1st of October, 1896, the lines showing such extension or prolongation shall be removed and expunged from the homologated plan, of St. Antoine Ward of the City of Montreal.\nIn November, 1896, the respondent petitioned the Supreme Court to erase the lines of said projected Burnside street from the homologated plan, and the Superior Court duly ordered said lines to be erased without opposition from the appellant or any one else.\nOn the 23rd November, 1896, the appellant instituted the present action against the City of Montreal to recover $15,000 in the nature of damages for having deprived her of the use of 3000 feet of ground during the twenty years above mentioned, and also for fees paid to her architects, etc. The respondent demurred to the action and further pleaded a general denial. The demurrer was maintained by the Superior Court and the action dismissed with costs (Doherty J.) and this judgment was confirmed by the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Blanchet dissenting. We have no notes from the judges in appeal, and we must suppose that they simply concurred in the reasons set forth by the first court. The following are the chief grounds of its judgment : Considering that neither by the allegations of plaintiff's declaration nor by anything established in evidence in this cause doth it appear that the damages alleged by plaintiff to have been suffered by her in consequence of the facts alleged in her declaration are the result of any fault of defendant, or of plaintiff being compelled by defendant or at its instance to give up any part of her property for a purpose of public utility ;\nSeeing articles 1053 and 407 C. C.\n\"(1053. Every person capable of discerning right from \"wrong is responsible for the damage caused by his fault to another, whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill.\n407. No one can be compelled to give up his property except for public utility and in consideration of a just indemnity previously paid).\"\nConsidering that under neither of these articles is plaintiff entitled to claim damages or indemnity from defendant by reason of the facts alleged in plaintiff's declaration ;\nConsidering that the only interference with the full enjoyment by plaintiff of her rights of ownership of the property described in her declaration which resulted from the making and the homologation of the plan in her declaration referred to was the effect of the disposition of the Act 37 Vict. chap. 51, sec. 171 (re-enacted by sec. 207 of the Act 52 Vict. chap. 79) that \"No indemnity or damage shall be claimed or granted at the time of the opening of any of the new streets, public places or squares shown on the said plan for any building or improvement whatsoever that the proprietors or other persons whomsoever may have made or caused to be nade, after the confirmation of the said plan, upon any land or property reserved for new streets, public places or squares\" ;\nConsidering that the effect of said disposition was not to deprive proprietors of property indicated on the said plan as reserved for new streets of such property, or to compel them to cede it, but merely to create a servitude for a purpose of public utility upon said property, or to impose a restriction upon the enjoyment of it, in the public interest;\nSeeing articles 406 and 507 C. C.\n\" (406. Ownership is the right of enjoying and of disposing of things in the most absolute manner \"provided that no use be made of them which is prohibited bylaw or by regulations. 507. The servitudes established for public utility have for their object the foot road or tow-path along the banks of navigable or floatable rivers, the construction or repair of roads or other poublic works. Whatever concerns this kind of servitude is determined by particular laws or regulations.)\"\nConsidering that under the first of said articles the absolute right of enjoyment belonging to an owner of property is subject to restrictions resulting from prohibitory laws or regulations as regards the use thereof;\nConsidering that under the second of said articles restrictions upon the right of enjoyment or use of his property by owner, which have for their object the construction of roads, constitute servitude for pur-poses of public utility, and that whatever concerns them is determined. by particular laws or regulations;\nConsidering that in the absence of express disposition of the particular law creating any such servitude declaring that the owners of properties subjected to it shall be entitled to indemnity by reason of the restriction of their enjoyment resulting therefrom, such properties are bound to submit to such restriction without compensation (7 Laurent, 474 and following ; 11 Demolombe 304) ;\nConsidering therefore that plaintiff has by law no recourse against defendant for the loss or damage set up by her in her declaration as having resulted from the making and homologation of the plan aforesaid, and that as regards all allegations setting up damages, resulting from said causes, and plaintiff's conclusions for a condemnation against d\u00e9fendant to pay the same, the defendant's demurrer should be maintained;\nConsidering, as regards the amount claimed as having been paid to pantiff's architects, because prior to the homologation of said plan she was notified by defendant that the land in question would be required for said street and not to build thereon, and was in consequence prevented. from building thereon in conformity with the plans said architects had then made, plaintiff has not proved any such notification, and even had she done so, such notice had not the effect of preventing her building, and if she chose voluntarily to acquiesce therein and abandon her prospect of building on the strip of land which defendant then contemplated or intended including in said plan, she cannot hold defendant responsible for the loss resulting from such voluntary act ;\nConsidering that the demurrer of defendant is well founded and further that plaintiff has failed to make good her demand, as against the plea of general issue filed by defendant, etc.\nWe entirely concur in the views thus expressed by the learned, trial judge. In the first place, this is not a case of expropriation. Such a proceeding was merely authorised, but not initiated. Finally, the respondent is not in fault, either when making a plan of the city indicating the continuation of Burnside Street or staking out said street on the premises according to said plan, and at the request of the appellant, but without any prise de possession, or not proceeding with the expropriation, or when abandoning said continuation. The city was acting within the limits of its rights as conferred by the legislature, and as the numerous French authorities quoted by the respondent establish, and according also to a recent decision of this court in Perrault v. Gauthier ([22]), whosoever acts within the limits of his rights commits no fault, and is not liable in damages.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be dismissed, and it is dismissed, with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants : F.

A survey of part of the line was made in 1828 and the remainder in 1850 and in 1892 the whole line was surveyed again and the result was held by the court below to establish it in accordance with the claim of E. In 1867 there was a private survey which established the line further north as claimed by S who contended that it and not the survey in 1892 was a retracing of the original line.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Strong C.

I would allow the appeal for the reasons given by Chief Justice Lacoste.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The sole question upon this appeal is as to the true location of the concession line between the 9th and 10th ranges or concessions of the Township of Eardley, in the Province of Quebec.\nFor the purposes of this suit it is admitted that the plaintiffs are seized of lots nos. 7, 8 and 9, in the 10th concession and the defendant of the lots so numbered in the 9th concession, or at least of the north parts of those lots and the contention between the parties is reduced to this that the plaintiffs in the action, the now respondents, contend that the concession line between those concessions is one continuous straight line to be traced from the south easterly angle of lot no. 14 in said tenth concession easter1y on a course S. 870 80' E. to the town line between the townships of Eardley and Hull while on the contrary the appellant, while not contesting the location of the concession west of lot no. 13 and east of lot no. 5, in the tenth concession to the town line of Hull to be as contended by the respondents, contends that at least as regards the said lots nos. 7, 8 and 9, it is situate about a quarter of a mile north of the place where the straight line as contended for by the respondents would place it.\nThe township of Eardley appears to have been surveyed by the Crown in three several parcels one in 1803 by a Mr. Watson, another in 1828 by a Mr. Burrows, and the third in 1850 by a Mr. Driscoll. It is only with the two last that we are at all concerned.\nWe are not furnished with the instructions given by the Surveyor-General in 1828 to Mr. Burrowes in accordance with which to make his survey, but we are furnished with the report made by him to the Surveyor General upon the completion of his survey which is sufficient for our purpose as it is not contended that his survey upon the ground was not as reported by him. His report is so short that it will be convenient to set it out in full, It is dated the 2nd April, 1828 and is as follows:\nSir,\u2014Agreeably to your instructions dated Hull the 6th day of October, I proceeded to survey and subdivide in the field the town ship of Eardley\u2014commenced from an old decayed post at the foot of the mountain marked VII on east side and VIII on west side also Con. VII on north side; measured and ran across two concessions being a distance of 161 c. 60 1., which brought me in front of the 9th range; planted a large substantial post properly marked continued westerly from lot no 8. to the side of the Ottawa which is on no 22, continued by offsets northerly to the front of the 10th concession on which ran easterly to lot no. 14 where the mountain from appearance of its roughness and steepness bids defiance to cultivation from post XIII and XIV ran north to the front of the 11th concession ran west to the division side line of the township. North 80 c. 80 1. to the 12th concession. East to lot no. 18, being at foot of hill. Returned on the concession line and ran north 80 c. 80 1. being the front of the 13th concession. Continued north to the front of the 14th concession returned on the same line to the front of the 13th concession and ran east to lot no 24 after which scaled the river to the side town line from lot no. 22 to 28, the particulars of which are stated in the field book herewith. Resting on the certainty that this survey has been properly performed, I remain Sir, &c., &c.\nJOHN BURROWES,\nD. Provi. Surveyor, This report establishes that Mr. Burrowes commenced his survey on a concession line previously established in front of the seventh concession at a point constituting the south east angle of lot no. 8 and the south-west angle of lot no. 7 in that concession. He then proceeded across the 7th and 8th concessions in a northerly direction along the eastern limit of the said lots numbered 8 in those concessions, 161 chains, 60 links to where he established the concession line in front of the 9th concession which he laid down upon the ground westerly marking the angles of the lots from nos. 8 to 22, both inclusive, upon which latter lot he reached the River Ottawa, and from the point so reached he laid off the lots in the 9th concession along the banks of the river westerly until he reached the concession line in front of the 10th concession near to the south westerly front angle of lot no. 25, in said 10th concession. He then laid down the lots in the said 10th concession from lot 25 to lot no. 14, both inclusive, and at the south easterly front angle of said lot no 14 where he determined also the south westerly front angle of lot no. 13, in said 10th concession, he planted a post marked xiii-xiv from which he measured northerly along the line between the said lots numbered 13 and 14 80 chains, 80 links to the concession line in front of the 11th concession. Thence he proceeded westerly along that concession line as described in his report, but not necessary to be further noticed here.\nBy this survey of Mr. Burrowes, the front lines of lots nos 8 and 9, and the south west front angle of lot no 7, in the ninth concession were fixed and determined upon the ground, as were also the front line of lot no. 14 and the south west front angle of lot 13, in the 10th concession, and the depth of those concessions was fixed and determined at 80 chains, 80 links. So much being determined by Mr. Burrowes' survey instructions were given by the Government in November, 1849, to Mr. Driscoll, to complete the survey of the residue of the Township of Eardley, that is to say, the part not already surveyed by Mr. Watson and Mr. Burrowes. By these instructions he was (among other matters not requiring notice as regards the question in issue on this appeal) directed to\nrepair along the line of division between the Townships of Hull and Eardley to a post erected by the said Mr Watson to divide the 6th and 7th ranges of Eardley which range line you will verify and trace and admeasure to the post erected between lots nos. 7 and 8 in the said line where Mr. Burrowes fixed his point of departure for the survey he performed in the said Township of Eardley.\nHe was also directed to\nchain the several range lines in continuation of those already drawn commencing respectively at the posts planted in the field as reported by Mr. Burrowes in his survey of 1828 and represented on a diagram (furnished to Mr. Driscoll) by the letters A, B, C, D and E, and to set off in each range lots of the breadth of 26 chains planting between each lot a square post properly inscribed and offset pickets indicating the course of the side line parallel to the township line;\nand he was directed further to carefully admeasure the depth of each range, as marked off by Mr. Burrowes on the lines run by him and edged red on the plan furnished to him He was directed further to note in his field book the quality of the soil and timber and finally to report the result of his survey accompanied with a plan to the Government. On the 14th May, 1850 Mr. Driscoll made his report to the Government of the survey made by him under these instructions and therein he stated that he had commenced his operations on the 1st of January, 1850, and he then proceeds as follows:\nHaving ascertained the position of the boundary mentioned in the instructions as at lots 7 and 8 I verified the said line to the town line where I ascertained the bearing of the said line and found it to be N. 2\u00b0 37' E. magnetically. I subsequently traced the same up to the rear of the township planting posts at the depth of 80 chains 81 links for the depth of the ranges up to the 13th range, which I found to be 86 chains I then proceeded to draw the several range lines on the magnetically course S. 87\u00b0 37' E. planting posts for the lots at a distance of 26 chains, the variation of the needle I found to be 6\u00b0 57' W.\nNow by this report it is established and there is no dispute upon this point, that before proceeding to continue the several concession lines from the points of the termination thereof respectively as determined by the survey of Mr. Burrowes, Mr. Driscoll determined by posts planted by him on the town line of Eardley and Hull the precise depths of the several concessions in accord with the survey of Mr. Burrowes, and precise points at which the several parts of the concession lines as surveyed by Burrowes when continued, would reach the eastern boundary line of Eardley; all that remained therefore, to complete such concession lines in accordance with the only survey authorized and directed by the Government, was to run a straight line from the several points of termination of the said several concession lines as determined by Burrowes's survey to the several posts so planted by Driscoll on the town line of Eardley and Hull. This report is addressed to the Commissioner of Crown Lands Montreal, and is accompanied by Mr. Driscoll's field book and diary and a plan of the line as run by him, and the report concludes with the following sentence:\nAccompanying the field book and diary is a plan on the scale of 40 chains to the inch the whole of which I submit for your approval.\nWe have been furnished, from Mr. Driscoll's field book, with certified copies of extracts of so much as is material to the case before us, that is to say, of the lines run by him in continuance of the concession lines run by Burrowes in front of the parts of the 9th and 10th concessions as reported to have been surveyed by him to the eastern limit of the township and of so much of the town line as extended from the post planted by Mr. Driscoll in front of the 9th concession to the post planted by him in front of the 10th concession. In such extracts he describes the nature of the soil and of the timber as he proceeded, mentioning also the streams crossed by him and their courses, &c, as directed in his instructions. In running the continuation of the 9th concession line he commenced as directed by his instructions at the termination of the line as run by Mr. Burrowes at the south east front angle of lot no. 8, and proceeded thence on a course S. 87\u00b0 30' east 26 chains, determining thus the front boundary of lot no. 7 at the S. E. angle of which he planted a post marked 6 and 7 \" on the face of a precipice.\" He then proceeded on the same course laying out the several lots with a frontage of 26 chains each and marking the respective front angles of each lot to and including no. 1 with posts marked respectively 6-5 and 5-4 and 4-3 and 3-2 and 2-1, until he reached the town line which constituted the eastern limit of lot no. 1 at post marked 8 and 9 for designating the concession line in rear of the 8th and in front of the 9th concession, whence he proceeded on a course N. 2 30' E. along such eastern limit of said lot no. 1 describing minutely the nature of the land so traversed until he reached \" post 9 and 10 on north side of pond '' so marked plainly to designate the eastern terminus of the concession line in rear of the 9th and in front of the 10th concession. He then as appears by his field book \" repaired to station B on range line X at post between lots xiii and xiv,\" and thence ran out concession line east\u2014S. 87\u00b0 30' E.,\u2014and on such line marked the front angles of each lot with posts numbered in like manner as on the 9th concession line describing also the soil, timber, &c., on the course traversed until he reached the south east angle of lot no. 2, which he marked with \" post ii and i, rough and rocky,\" thence he proceeded along the front line of lot 1, describing minutely the character of the ground thus :\u2014at the distance of 50 links from the south east angle of lot no. 2 \" Creek 6 links.\" At the distance of 10 chains \"steeply descending;\" at the distance of 15 chains \" intersect road across portages;\" at the distance of 19 chains s small creek going into pond;\" at the distance of 21 chains, 50 links \" pond shore;\" at the distance of 26 chains \" post I and O, town line.\"\nThe plan which accompanied the report shewed continuous straight lines for the continuation of the several concession lines from the respective points of termination of those lines as surveyed by Burrowes, run out to the eastern limit of the township and this is the only plan of the survey made by Driscoll ever received by the Government. Now this p1an accompanied with the above extracts from Driscoll's field book constitute prim\u00c6facie positive and direct evidence that the concession lines in front of the 9th and 10th concessions respectively were run by Driscoll in precise conformity with the Government instructions given to him from the eastern termination of those lines as run by Burrowes in a continuous straight line to the eastern limit of the township. In corroboration, however, the plaintiff has produced a man named George H\u00e9bert, employed as picket man on the Driscoll survey in 1850. This witness of the age of 76 when examined in 1893, confirms in the clearest manner the evidence furnished by the surveyor's report and field notes. This witness was on the survey by Driscoll of the concession lines in front of the 8th and of the 9th concessions and also of the concession line in front of the 10th concession as far as lot 4 in that concession when he left the work and returned to his home which was on lot 8 in the 8th concession. Having been asked how he knew it was lot 4 he had reached when he left, he said that when leaving the surveyor informed him that there remained but three lots to the town line. All the lines were run from the west to the east. In front of the 10th concession they commenced at a post pointed out by a Mr. Rayside, who lived in the neighbourhood, whether it was on lot 15 or lot 14, or what lot in particular he could not say, but it was from an old post east of Mr. Rayside's place and situate at the foot of the mountain. Now it will be remembered that Mr. Burrowes in his report remarks that where he terminated his survey on lot 14 \" the mountain from appearance of the roughness and the steepness bids defiance to cultivation.\" The witness then states that from this the point of commencement they continued the survey on a straight line east without any jog, angle, or deviation whatever, blazing and planting posts as they went along, some of the blazing having been done by himself, until they reached the lot at which the witness left the work and which he believed to be lot 4 for the reason already stated. About the last thing which he did on the evening of which he left was as he said that he made a post out of a spruce tree which was there, and the post so cut by him was planted on the lot where he left off working and returned to his home; a few years after he left the township and has ever since resided in another township and was never again on the concession line until just before his examination. Having been subpnaed as a witness, as a person employed on the original survey, he went over the line in company with one Bourgeau. On this occasion be observed on the top of the mountain an old blaze on a pine tree which had fallen then another in the middle of a ridge of hardwood and a third further on, which is between lots 9 and 10. The witness did not profess to swear that these blazes were made at the Driscoll survey but that he believed them to be such and that they were old blazes, and were on the line run as the concession line at the running of which the witness was employed. He said further, and this is certainly of special value as showing the witness to be a very intelligent and observant man, when he came to a creek which they crossed on the line he said to Bourgeau that a little further on they would cross another creek where there was a flat square rock over which the concession line passed, and accordingly that as they proceeded they came to the creek and the rock. He also as he said recognized a large blazed spruce tree which was near the rock and which he had seen on the survey. He said further that they proceeded east until they reached the place where he had left the work after having made a post from a spruce tree and which was planted there and he saw there lying on the ground an old square spruce post, rotten at the stump but partly still solid and having still marks on it which he believed to be the post he had cut from the spruce tree as already mentioned. Now this witness is corroborated by Bourgeau as to what he had said when crossing a creek on the line as to there being another a little further on and as to the rock and that the fact occurred as H\u00e9bert had said it should occur. Bourgeau also says that they started on the concession line in front of lot no. 13 in the 10th concession which he knew well and they proceeded in a straight line easterly in continuation of the line in front of lots 15 14 and 13 to lot 4 where H\u00e9bert rectonized the old post found lying there as he had said. He also fixed the last two blazes spoken of by H\u00e9bert, one as being at the line between lots 9 and 10 and the other as being at the line between lots 11 and 12 Julien Delorme aged 68 at the time of his examination in 1893 was born on lot 15 in 8th concession of Eardley, and has lived in the township all his life, and since the year 1867 on the north half of lot no. 13 in the 9th concession, which lot abuts on the concession line between the 9th and 10th concessions. This line so far as the witness has ever heard, has always been called and known as the Driscoll line. He did not see the line when being run, but he remembers the time and hearing it spoken of at the time it was being run. He had known the lot for four years before he went to reside on it, that is as far back as 1863. He knows also the line called the Baldwin line the line north by the distance of 7 or 8 arpents of the line called the Driscoll line. Before ever the Baldwin line was run, and as far back as 1865, he saw a post on the southern or Driscoll line at the line between lots 11 and 12. It was a marked post but as he could not read he could not say what the marks were * but it was a marked post. He had gone to look for wood on lots 11 and 12, as the rest of the lots were taken up. The first fire which occurred about 1868 partially de stroyed that post and the subsequent fires, of which there were two, wholly destroyed it. He has often been in that part of the country gathering blueberries and he has often travelled eastward upon this line to where he has spoken of the post having been before it was destroyed by fire. The line was quite visible before the fires. He has never travelled east of lot 11.\nLeon Lebrun aged 53 has lived on the south half of lot 15 in the 10th concession since the year 1858 The concession line in front of that lot ran easterly in front of 15,14 and 13, and was quite visible and it was then and always since has been called and known among the neighbours as the Driscoll line. About 24 years before his examination and before any of the fires he was employed by one Gibson, getting out timber in the bush in the 10th concession and in front of the lot on which he was working he saw a post marked 9 on south side and 10 on north side, indicating the concession line in front of the lot on which he was working; that post was situate from 6 to 8 arpents south of a post on the Baldwin line which he knew well. He only saw the post that once for when he next was that way was after the fire and it was gone; the other sides of the post were also marked, but he could not from memory say what were the marks which he saw on it. He described the post as having been on a rock near which was \"un basin d'eau\" where the water ran in wet weather; his description corresponds with the work of which H\u00e9bert had spoken. When he was there next after the fire he says the post was gone and nothing remained but the rock, and there has never been a post there until George C. Rainboth ran the line in 1892. After Rainboth had finished his line he took witness over that part extending from lot no. 9 to his own lot no. 15, and witness says that Rain both's line runs within fifteen feet of the place where he saw the post, which now he understands to be at the line between lots 11 and 12.\nCharles Lusignan, aged 56, in 1863 bought the west half of lot no. 14 in the 9th concession of Eardley, and lived on it for 14 years when he moved to lot 16, in the 9th concession where he has lived ever since. His lot abutted on the concession line. When he went to live on 14 in 1863 there were old posts between 15 and 16 and between 15 and 14, and at the front angle of 14 and 13, in the concession line there was a tree blazed marking the line between 14 and 13; that blazed tree was used to guard his land, that is, to shew the line between 14 and 13. About the year 1865 he was employed by a Mr. Baldwin, who had a saw mill, to get out lumber on lots 12 and 13 in the 10th con cession; had then to know the line in front of the lots * they worked by that line, the Driscoll line; used to go by the blazes; did not look for a post. He used to go up between 12 and 13; that line was indicated by a blaze on the Driscoll line did not look for a post, the blaze was sufficient for his purpose. The Driscoll line east of 12 was visible but he never travelled on it east of that lot until about a fortnight before he was examined as a witness in this case. He was working on lot 12 together with one of his brothers making saw logs for Mr. Baldwin, who owned a saw mill in the neighbourhood where the Baldwin line was run down from the mountain had to look for the Driscoll line then so as not to cross that line; the Baldwin line was brought down into lot 15 and to the concession line near to the line between 14 and 15 ; it crossed the line between 14 and 15 about three and a half acres north of the Driscoll line. He knows where the Baldwin line runs and the country through which it passes well, and he never saw any sign of a line there before Thistle and Baldwin ran their line.\nChristie Miner, aged 42, says his father owned and lived upon the west half of lot 11 in the 9th concession of Eardley, and witness himself lived on it until 15 years before he gave his evidence in 1893; when he was a boy about 13 or 14 he and his father were out together and that in rear of their lot 11, in the 9th concession, on which they lived, he saw a post it had marks on it. Again about 18 or 19 years ago when ascertaining boundaries with the owner of the other half he again saw the post and he and his neighbour took it to determine the boundary of their lot. There was a post also another post on the concession line then on the east corner of lot 11. These were then old posts but have since been burned to the ground. That concession line has always been called the Driscoll line He saw the beech tree at the line between 9 and 10 about 18 years ago; the tree was blazed on four sides, its appearance was for a post.\nMr. Geo. C. Rainboth, a licensed surveyor, testified that in 1892 he was employed by the plaintiffs to ascertain and lay down the boundaries of lots 7, 8 and 9 in the 10th concession. This work necessitated his ascertaining the true concession line as originally surveyed by Driscoll in front of the 10th concession\u00bb So far as appears this was the first occasion upon which a surveyor had attempted to trace that line in an efficient and legal manner. He first determined the line in front of lots 1, 2, 3 and 4 to accord precisely with Driscoll's field notes. He then continued on that line projected in a straight line westerly until he reached about the centre of lot 6 * he found many old blazes, 42 years old, corresponding precisely with the period of the Driscoll survey. He proceeded up to the western extremity where he found a post between lots 15 and 14; from lot 6 to lot 14 he found no reliable traces but he says that from lot 9 westward the country has been so badly burned that no trace of the original line remained. Apart from the destruction by fire the evidence shewed that the whole country round had been lumbered over for a period of from 40 to 50 years.\nMr. Driscoll in his report in 1850 has this paragraph:\nFrom the mountainous nature of the country and the position of the hills with regard to the settlement on the old survey there are no facilities for making a good road without great expense. The roads which are at present used by the inhabitants are those which have been cut by enterprising lumberers, and although very rough in the summer season are nevertheless good and of great service during the winter And Mr. Robert Kennedy Lusk, who was the first to see posts in 1851 across lots 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, says that he himself got that year a Crown license over lots 9 10 and 11 and that at that time a Mr. Smith was lumbering in that neighbourhood who wanted to get a road to the front and that Lusk undertook to make and as he says, did make one for him, but where is not stated.\nMr. Rainboth having so reached lot 14, surveyed the line back from lot 14 to lot 4 and divided the distance in the manner required by art. 4155 of the revised statutes which announces the law as it has been ever since the passing of the statute of the late Province of Canada 12 Vict. ch. 35, sec. 20. In the course of his survey Mr. Rainboth observed two or three points of special importance. 1st, that the line in front of lots 1, 2, 3 and 4, was run from the west on the original survey. 2nd. Where the Driscoll line crosses the line between lots 9 and 10, his field notes describe the land and timber found there thus: \"fine level hardwood land good soil,\" and he testifies that this is correct, while where the northern or Baldwin line crosses the same line it is a spruce swamp all around and no hardwood within eight or ten chains. And all this is confirmed by several other witnesses. Then 3rd. On the original line run by Driscoll, as described in his field notes, there is a creek on lot 10 said to be distant 7 chains from the line between 11 and 10. Mr. Rainboth found the distance of the creek from the line as established by his survey to be 5 chains, 58 links, while the distance of that same creek from the said line between 11 and 10 is by measurement made by Mr. Rainboth, 14 chains, 20 links. These two latter facts afford strong confirmation that the southern line was the line run and reported by Driscoll. Now the answer of the appellant to all this evidence is that Driscoll never ran the southern line at all hut that the line which he ran is the same line as that which Baldwin ran in 1867 which line is contended to be a simple retracing of the original Driscoll line and by way of explanation of the extraordinary circumstances that a surveyor should deviate from his instructions so as to leave the Burrowes line which it was his duty to continue in a straight line eastward and to go north to a point distant about a quarter of a mile from the true line he was directed to run and then to turn and run easterly nearly parallel with the Burrowes line continued on the true line and after traversing such easterly course for a couple of miles to diverge again south and to go precisely the distance necessary to reach a point which would be on the Burrowes line if continued from west to east, all that is offered is a suggestion, not founded upon any evidence whatever, that the line was run by two persons, one commencing at the eastern extremity of the township at the town line, and the other at the western end at the extremity of the Burrowes survey. But this suggestion, if it has any effect at all, only increases the difficulty, for it assumes that two parties made mistakes of which there appears no natural explanation whatever. For why should the party surveying from the east across four lots along the true line after planting a post which indicated the southeast angle of lot no. 5 go north on the side line of that lot? A surveyor surely could not imagine that by going up a side line of a lot in the 10th concession he could make that side line a part of the concession line in front of the concession, or that after determining the sites of the south-east angle of lot no. 5. on the concession line as first run, he could move it to a point 17 chains 47 links north; and why did the surveyor go north at all, and why stop at reaching the distance of 17 chains 47 links, and then diverge to the west upon a line nearly parallel to the line he had first run and had left? Then how did it happen that the surveyor commencing at the west end left the Burrowes line altogether and instead of continuing it by running a course S. 87\u00b0 30' East ran on a course north-easterly until he reached a point distant nearly a quarter of a mile north of the true line as directed to be run and then diverge on a course south-easterly so as to meet exactly somewhere, the party running from the east? What determined the point where the north-easterly course should cease and the divergence upon the south-east-early course should commence? It is quite obvious that such a state of things could never occur without prearrangement of a very precise character between the two surveyors on the survey; but the suggestion requires this further addition to be made to it, namely, that while the survey was conducted by Mr. Driscoll in this manner designedly in violation of his instructions and his authority, he made a false report to the Government showing the line to have been run as if it had in fact been run on the course directed It is impossible that a suggestion so utterly unfounded upon any evidence can be entertained for a moment.\nNow as to the survey called the Baldwin survey, in 1867, which is claimed to have been simply a retracing of the Driscoll line. It appears that Mr. Baldwin under whose name the line run in 1867 is known was not a licensed surveyor in Lower Canada, but was in Upper Canada, where he resided, and was a partner of a Mr. Thistle, who was a licensed surveyor in Lower Canada, and that a young man named Lang was Thistle's articled clerk. The lines run in 1867, of which the line called the Baldwin line was one .appear to have been run by Lang under the direction of Baldwin. As to the particular line in question here we have Lang's testimony that the course pursued was this:\nThey first found what he calls the range line at the post between lots 11 and 12, where ne says: \u201cthe range line was found.\" They commenced then, plainly on the assumption that the line upon which they found the post between lots 11 and 12 was the concession line. He then says that under the directions of Mr. Baldwin, the line was run westerly to the brow of the mountain at about lot 13 then he says that the line was found \" west of the mountain at about the line between lots 15 and 16.\" The point here designated plainly is on the old Burrowes line and is the point which is made the western extremity of the Baldwin line, but Mr. Lang gives no particulars as to the mode by which Mr. Baldwin determined and reached such point. He was most probably not present with Baldwin at that portion of the work, for he says that he himself afterwards commenced from about between lots 11 and 10 (he probably meant 11 and 12 from which Baldwin had proceeded westward) and continued eastward. We have however the evidence of Mr. Joseph Lusk, one of the appellant's witnesses who though not himself employed on the work was present when Baldwin was proceeding with that work. He says that\nthey built a fire between lots 12 and 13 on the mountain and they came down to between lots 14 and 15, an4 they ran a line through lots 13 and 14 and they connected these two points together where they could not find any old line.\nAgain he says that there was a piece of the line gone there through lots fourteen, thirteen and twelve, and that they had a lot to survey around for him, namely, lot 13, in the 10th concession \" and they had to get a concession line there, and they ran one across and connected both together;\" so they made a fire on the mountain between 12 and 13; and he says \"they went afterwards between lots 14 and 15 where they got a post of the old survey and they connected these two Points.\" And he adds from the line so determined they ran round his lot 13 in the 10th range and he adds that this was all they had to do from lot 15 to lot 12, for that the fire had burned the old line and they could not trace it. But there is not a particle of evidence that any trace of an old line had ever been seen there. Pierre Lusignan says that he saw the Baldwin party coming down from the mountain where they had built a fire and that they crossed the line between lots 14 and 15 about 3 arpents north of the post on the Burrowes concession line, and that they crossed lot 15 to the post in front between lots 15 and 16 that is on the old Burrowes line. This is the only evidence we have of the manner in which Baldwin's line from the post on the line between lots 11 and 12 was connected with the Burrowes concession line in front of the 10th concession, and it is manifest that the survey proceeded wholly upon the assumption that the line claimed by the appellants as marked by the posts across lots 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, situate nearly a quarter of a mile north of the line as reported by Mr. Driscoll, constituted the true concession line\nNow Lang, as to the work done by himself says that he\nfollowed up the range line preparatory to the running of the side lines between several of the lots, from about the point marked E to the point marked B, and from the point marked A, to a point eastward of lot number 2 as shewn upon plan exhibit \" C \";\nand he said that he did not recollect reaching the town line. The plan so referred to he said was a plan made by himself and on it the point marked E is placed on the line between lots 11 and 10. This is probably placed there by mistake-instead of at the line between lots 11 and 12, where as he had said they had \u201cfirst found the range line,\" and from which Baldwin had proceeded west ward. The point marked B on the plan is placed on the side line between lots 5 and 4, at the distance of 17 chains 47 links north of a line found upon the ground and which is shown by the evidence to be the eastern end of the line as reported by Driscoll to be the line run by him for the concession line. The point A is at the south-west angle of lot no. 4, and the south-east angle of lot no. 5 in the 10th concession, fronting on the concession line as reported by Driscoll. The space from B to A is shown to be not upon a concession line at all but upon a side line of lots in the 10th concession whose front is on a line south 17 chains 47 links from the Baldwin line; and the line from A east ward is precisely where the eastern end of the Driscoll line if run as reported by him would be, from the front of the side line between lots 5 and 4, to the town line.\nIt may here be observed that upon this plan the western extremity of the Baldwin line from the line between lots 11 and 12 is drawn across lot 12 and for a short distance, about five or six chains into lot 13 where it reaches the mountain at a point where presumably the fire may have been built, so far the line runs in apparent continuation of the course of the line across lot 11 but where no post or trace of a line was found, or so far as appears ever was, and upon reaching the point in lot 13 where presumably the fire may have been built, it diverges upon a wholly different line across the residue of lots 13 and the whole of lots 14 and 15 to the post on the Burrowes concession line between lots 15 and 16 which Mr. Lang makes the western extremity of the line as surveyed by Mr. Baldwin and not the post between lots 14 and 15. This line so run by Mr. Baldwin is called a retracing of the line as run by Driscoll in 1850, as the concession line in front of the 10th concession, but it obviously was nothing of the kind. Had the object been to determine where Driscoll had run that concession line the surveyor's plain duty was with copies of Driscoll's instructions report, and field notes in his hand to have commenced at the point where alone his instructions authorised Driscoll to commence his survey of the continuation of the Burrowes line in front of the 10th concession, and to have continued therefrom on the line indicated by Driscoll's report and field notes and if he had deviated from the straight line which his instructions directed him to follow, the place where and the reason why such deviation had taken place and the course taken upon the deviation would have appeared; but nothing of the kind was done, and moreover, upon no part of the Baldwin line west of the post on the line between lots 11 and 12 which Mr. Baldwin made his point of commencement was any post or trace found of a prior line having been run and neither upon it nor upon any part of the Baldwin line from the Burrowes concession to the point B, on the plan made by Lang, is there a particle of evidence that Driscoll was seen engaged in a survey * his instructions invested him with no authority to run such a line, nor did there appear anything in his report or field notes, or upon the ground to warrant the supposition that he had run such a line. Now as to the work done by Lang on his survey eastward, we have a fuller and different account from a witness named Paul Lebrun who accompanied Lang and was employed in breaking down branches twigs, &c., to enable him to get a straight sight ahead for his line. This witness says that from the point of commencement they found no line or posts. Blazes there were enough in the woods around but none in a straight line as run by a surveyor. Lang made a straight line and they chained along, but planted no posts on the route eastward. The evidence of Joseph Lusk affords confirmation of this evidence of Lebrun that Lang found no straight line previously run, for he says that between the Baldwin line and what he calls the old line there was a difference of some rods at the lines between lots 9 and 10 and between lots 11 and 12. And the line between 7 and 8 is the only place spoken of where the two lines are said to have agreed. Then on arriving at the point which Lang on his plan marked with the letter B which is the western side line of lot 4 Lebrun says that Lang \"il s'est trouv\u00e9 comme d\u00e9sol\u00e9 \" at not finding a line. Then some of the party suggested that there was an old man on the town line who knew the line better than anyone and could shew it to them, accordingly they went over to the town line found a person who shewed them the terminus of the cod cession line near a little lake or pond there; and from this point the next morning Lang proceeded westward along the line in front of lots 1, 2, 3 and 4 without the aid of a compass; on arriving at the line between lots 4 and 5 Lebrun says that he was proceeding straight on westward in advance as he had done all along, and that he had not gone further than one hundred feet when Lang called him back saying that the line went no further, and he went north to where he had stopped the work the previous evening and there then planted a post; from that post they proceeded westward on the line run the day before and planted posts at such places as Lang directed until they reached the line between lots 11 and 12 where their work stopped. Now upon this evidence it is abundantly proved that the line run by Driscoll as and for the concession line in front of the 10th concession is the one he was directed to run and which alone he had authority to run as such concession line, namely from the eastern extremity of the Burrowes line in a straight line to the town line, the eastern extremity of which line so run by him has always been known in front of lots 4, 3, 2 and 1. This really determines the whole question, for that line having been run by Driscoll, the line which George C. Rainboth ran in 1892 was that which under the circumstances in evidence the law required him to run in retracing the Driscoll line. It is also clear that there is no evidence that any line was run by any person westward of the post on the line between, lots 11 and 12 on the northern or Baldwin line to the Burrowes concession line at any point. It is unnecessary therefore to inquire if there had been evidence that Driscoll had run the line run by Baldwin between those points thus crossing lots 15 and 14 the whole of whose boundaries were determined by the Burrowes survey and across lot 13 the south western angle of which was determined by and was upon the Burrowes concession line and the western side line of which was run by Burrowes, whether such a line being wholly illegal in its inception as crossing those lots in the 10th concession fronting on the Burrowes line could have constituted a legal concession line in front of the 10th concession or of any part of it. Then east of lot 7 the evidence failed to show any line run eastward prior to the Baldwin line run in 1867 unless what Mr. Genest says in his report be accepted as such evidence. He there says that he found a beech tree upon lot 6, and a spruce tree upon lot 5 the blazes upon which indicated that they had been made 44 years before he examined them, which as he made his inspection in the end of October of 1895 would seem to point to 1851 as the year in which they were made whereas the Driscoll concession line was run in January, 1850. This witness, like all other witnesses of the appellant assumes that blazes being proved to have been made in or about the year 1850 affords proof of their having been made by Driscoll in 1850 although he was never seen running a line where the blazes are found. However, east of the above spruce tree Mr. Genest concurs that there was no trace of any line having been run prior to the Baldwin survey and the spruce tree is placed on Mr. Grenest's map as upon lot 5, at a point about 8 chains east of the line between lots 6 and 5. Now there being no trace whatever of a line east of that spruce tree nor west of the line between lots 11 and 12 it is plain that the line between those points must have been run for some other purpose than a concession line in front of the 10th concession from which concession line the line so run is as absolutely separate and distinct as it is from the line in front of the 11th concession and whether it was run by Mr. Driscoll in 1850 or not, matters not, although I am unable to see any evidence which would justify a court in adjudicating that in point of fact it was run at all by Mr. Driscoll But all this is irrelevant in reality for as already observed it is impossible upon the evidence in the case to come to any other conclusion than that Mr. Driscoll ran the concession line precisely as he was directed, and as alone he had authority to run it, namely, upon the straight line from the terminus of the Burrowes line in continuation of that line to the town line, as reported by Driscoll, and as testified by H\u00e9bert in his evidence, of which line so run by Driscoll, that in front of lots 4, 3, 2 and 1 constitutes the eastern extremity and no other line can be pronounced to be the true concession line than the line so run, and Mr. Greorge C. Rainboth under the circumstances in evidence adopted the only course which the law authorised for relaying the concession line west of lot 4. That line must therefore be affirmed, and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Henry Aylen.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Rocton & Champagne.\n"}

(Eddy v. Eddy [Coutl\u00e9e's Dig. 23] followed.) APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada, sitting in review, at Quebec, affirming the judgment of Sir Louis Casault, Chief Justice of the Superior Court, (which condemned the defendant to pay the plaintiff $5,689.24,) and dismissing an appeal therefrom by the plaintiff seeking to have the amount of the said judgment increased.\nThis appeal was brought under an order of a judge of the court appealed from granting leave to appeal under the provisions of the forty-second section of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, after the expiration of the time limited for bringing appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada, under the fortieth section of that Act. No special circumstances were mentioned in the order granting leave to appeal nor did the order state that leave had been granted under special circumstances, but it was admitted that due notice of the application had been given to the defendant that the whole record was before the judge at the time he made the order and that the application had not been opposed in the court below. It also appeared that the inscription of the appeal for hearing in the Supreme Court had been made after the plaintiff had received notice of the taking of an appeal by the defendant to Her Majesty's Privy Council from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench on appeal by him from the Superior Court and before the hearing of such appeal in the Privy Council.\nMotions were made on behalf of the respondent when the appeal was called for hearing in the Supreme Court. First : that the appeal to the Supreme Court should be quashed on the grounds that it had not been taken within sixty days from the pronouncing of the judgment appealed from, and that the application and order for special leave did not shew special circumstances necessary to give jurisdiction to the judge of the court appealed from to grant such special leave for the appeal l and secondly : that all proceedings upon said appeal should be stayed and suspended until the respondent's appeal pending before the Privy Council should have been disposed of.\nBelleau Q.C. for the motions cited sections 40 and 42 of the \"Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act,t and the cases of McGreevy v. McDougall and Eddy v. Eddy, mentioned in Coutl\u00e9e's Supreme Court Digest, at pages 9 and 23.\nFitzpatrick Q.C (Solicitor General for Canada) contra. The defendant had notice of the application for leave and did not oppose it in the court below. The question should not be as to the form of the application or order or what allegations they may contain, but whether there actually did exist special circumstances which, in the judge's discretion, should entitle the party making the application to have leave to appeal. The record which was before the judge on the application shewed that such special circumstances did exist and consequently the judge had full jurisdiction to act and, as a judge of a superior tribunal, he was not obliged to shew his jurisdiction upon the face of his order. The judge's discretion once exercised cannot be reviewed by this court.\nAfter hearing counsel, the court was of opinion that the judge of the court below had jurisdiction and that the order granting leave to appeal had been properly made and accordingly dismissed the motion to quash with costs.\nThe motion to stay proceedings pending the decision of the appeal to the Privy Council was granted and, as the inscription for hearing had been made subsequent to the decision in Eddy v. Eddy ([1]), which settled the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada in such cases, it was held that the appellant should not have inscribed the case and the respondent was allowed costs on the latter motion.\nMotion to quash dismissed with costs.\nMotion to stay proceedings allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fitzpatrick & Taschereau.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Louis G.

The evidence indicated that the sand was left on the road by a labourer working under directions from the pathmaster or by a ratepayer engaged in the performance of statute labour.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that the action must fail for want of evidence that the injury was caused by some person for whose acts the municipal corporation was responsible.\nPer Strong C.J. Qu\u0153re. Is the corporation liable for the acts of a statutory officer like the pathmaster, or of a ratepayer in performance of statute labour?\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head note. Gundy for the appellants cited Stalker v. Township of Dunwich[1]; Hesketh v. City of Toronto[2]; City of St. John v. Campbell[3].\nMatthew Wilson Q.C. for the respondent was not called upon.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (Oral):\u2014We are all of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed, and as it does not involve any question of law we may decide it at once. The Court of Appeal were of opinion that the evidence was insufficient to establish the material fact, indispensable to the maintenance of the action, that the dumping of the gravel complained of was done by somebody for whose acts the municipal corporation was responsible. This conclusion was entirely right.\nSpeaking for myself I concur on the grounds relied on by Osler and Moss JJA. in the Court of Appeal, though I am unable to agree with Mr. Justice Maclennan that it was a case of non-repair. If it was there would be no liability because, first, there was no notice of action; and secondly, there would have been no proof that the municipality had notice of the want of repair which could only have existed between the hours of 3 and 8 p.m. of the day of the accident.\nThen as to the question as to whether or not the gravel was dumped on the road by some one acting under the orders of the council or of some person for whom the council was responsible, there is not a title of evidence. It is useless to talk of presumptions in such a case for, in such a case, so to act would be merely to guess. If there had been any evidence I should have wished to consider how far the council was responsible for the acts of a statutory officer like the pathmaster. Then, again, the dumping might have been done by a ratepayer in which case there would have arisen a similar question of law, with which we are not now called upon to deal, namely, how far the council is responsible for the acts of such a person.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE (Oral):\u2014I entirely concurin what His Lordship has said, and would like to add a few words. It does not appear to me that the corporation can be made liable at all for the gravel having been left where it was by some of the persons engaged in repairing the road. It was not wrongful to leave it there; the only wrong of the corporation, if any, was in suffering it to remain there during the night without a light. But there is not a particle of evidence that the corporation, or any one belonging to the corporation, knew it was there at all, and how could they be guilty of negligence?\nSEDGEWICK, KING and GIROUARD, J.J. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.E.

The petition was dismissed; on an appeal to the Court of Review, the judgment dismissing the petition was affirmed, and further appeal was then taken to the Supreme Court of Canada. On motion to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction;\u2014\nHeld, that no appeal de plano would lie from the judgment of the Court of Review to Her Majesty's Privy Council, and consequently there was no appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court of Canada under the provisions of the Act 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 25 sec. 3, amending The Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\nHeld, further, that the judgment of the Court of Review was not a final judgment within the meaning of section 29 of The Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act. APPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada, sitting in review, at Montreal ([1]), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which dismissed the petition of the appellants for the recusation of the respondent Ewing as a commissioner in expropriation proceedings taken for the improvement of a public street in the City of Montreal.\nDuring the course of proceedings for the expropriation of lands for the purpose of widening a street in the City of Montreal, the appellants, being ratepayers interested in the lands sought to be expropriated, took objection to the appointment of the respondent Ewing as one of the commissioners on the ground that he was related to an owner of some of the lands in question, and petitioned the Superior Court for his recusation and removal. The petition was dismissed with costs and on appeal to the Court of Review the judgment was affirmed, whereupon a further appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMotion by the respondents to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nAtwater Q.C. and Ethier Q.C. for the motion. The judgment from which the appeal is sought is not a final judgment within the meaning of sec. 29 of The Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, and sub-sec. j. of sec. 24 does not apply ; Demers v. Bank of Montreal ([2]) ; art. 68 C. P. Q. There cannot be an appeal in this case from the Court of Review to the Supreme Court of Canada as the matter in controversy is not appealable as of right to Her Majesty's Privy Council, Dufresne v. Guevremont ([3]). Lemieux contra. The decision appealed from is final, as it deprives the appellants of their right to have the objectionable commissioner removed, subjects them finally to an injustice and absolutely decides upon the merits of the petition Had the petition been allowed the whole matter would have been finally decided and the roll so far as made nullified. The controversy affects titles to land and will bind rights in future, consequently an appeal would lie to the Privy Council and under the statute 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 25 sec. 3 there is jurisdiction in this court to entertain the appeal. We refer to Murray v. The Town of Westmount ([4]) ; Les Eccl\u00e9siastiques, etc., de St. Sulpice v. The City of Montreal ([5]); Rebum v.

Ry. Co. executed an agreement to sell certain lands to H., who entered into possession, made improvements, and paid the purchase money, whereupon a deed was delivered to him which he refused to accept as it reserved the minerals on the land while the agreement was for an unconditional sale. In an action by H. for specific performance of the agreement the company contended that in its conveyances the word \" land \" was always used as meaning land minus the minerals.\nHeld, reserving the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia (6 B. C. Rep. 228), Taschereau J. dissenting, that the contract for sale being expressed in unambiguous language, and H. having had no notice of any reservations, it could not be rescinded on the ground of mistake and he was entitled to a decree for specific performance.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1], varying the decree at the trial which declared the plaintiff entitled to a conveyance but not to specific performance:\nThe action was brought by the appellant to enforce specific performance of an agreement by the railway company to sell to him certain land in British Columbia. The agreement is contained in the follow- ing document delivered to appellant in pursuance of his request for an allotment.\n\"ESQUIMALT & NANAIMO RAILWAY CO\u2014LAND DEPARTMENT.\"\nVICTORIA, B.C., Nov. 28th, 1889.\n\" Received of Frank Vicker Hobbs, the sum of one hundred and twenty dollars ($120.00), being a first payment on account of his purchase from the E. & N. Ry. Company of one hundred and sixty (160) acres of land in Bright District, at the price of three dollars ($3.00) an acre. Commencing at a point about two (2) miles west of Louis Stark's Crown Grant in Cranberry District; thence running west forty chains to Berkeley Creek: thence south 40 chains ; thence east 40 chains ; thence north 40 chains to place of commencement, the balance of purchase money to be paid in three equal instalments of seventy-five (75) cents an acre, at the expiration of one, two and three years from date, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum.\"\n(Sgd.) JOHN TRUTCH,\n\"Land Commissioner.\"\nThe question in dispute between the parties is whether or not the railway company, in executing the conveyance to carry out this agreement, is entitled to reserve the minerals in the land therein described.\nThe company claims that Mr. Trutch had no authority to convey the minerals, and that in its forms of conveyance the word land is always used to mean surface rights only. The trial Judge held that the claim as to want of authority was well founded, but that the company had ratified the agreement. As he was of opinion, however, that the ratification was made under a mistake as to the legal effect of the agreement he refused to decree specific performance but declared in his judgment that the plaintiff was entitled at his option to a conveyance as offered by de- fendants or to repayment of the purchase money with interest and compensation for improvements. The plaintiff appealed and the decree was varied by a direction that the plaintiff was entitled to a conveyance reserving the minerals without option of repayment. The plaintiff then appealed to this court.\nRiddell for the appellant. The trial judge held that Trutch had no authority to sell minerals. But corporations cannot invest agents with authority and then limit it by private instructions. Royal British Bank v. Turquand[2] ; Mahony v. East Holyford Mining Co. [3]; South of Ireland Colliery Co. v. Waddle [4]; Canada Central Railway Co. v. Murray[5].\nA mistake as to the legal effect of an agreement is no answer to a claim for specific performance. Stewart v. Kennedy[6].\nHogg Q.C. and Marsh Q.C. for the respondent. As to the effect of a mistake in a contract for a sale, see Ball v. storie[7] ; Alvanley v. Kinnaird[8]. Also Hussey v. Horne\u2014Payne[9]; Day v. Wells[10], where specific performance was refused.\nCourts have granted relief against mistakes in law. Hood v. Oglander[11] ; Coward v. Hughes[12]. And it makes the case stronger where there is a mistake both of law and fact. Broughton v. Hutt[13].\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014 I would dismiss this appeal. The reasons given in the courts below against the appellant's right to specific performance are, in my opinion, unanswerable. There has been no contract between this company and Hobbs. The company thought they were selling the land without the minerals ; Hobbs thought he was buying the land with the minerals. So that the company did not sell what Hobbs thought he was buying, and Hobbs did not buy what the company thought they were selling. Therefore there was no contract between them. Hobbs would not have bought if he had known that the company were selling only surface rights, and the company would not have sold if they had thought that Hobbs intended to buy the land with the minerals. The ratification by the company stands upon no better ground. It was nothing but the ratification of a sale without the minerals. Banque Jacques Cartier v. Banque d' Epargne de la Cite et du District de Montreal[14]. Appellant's contentions on this ratification savour of a petitio principii.\nThe rule that any one dealing with another has the right to believe that this other one means what he says, or says what he means, is one that cannot be gainsaid. But it has no application here. Assuming that the agent sold the land with the minerals, he did what he had not the power to do. However, he did not do it.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This case is in my opinion reduced upon the evidence into a simple question of the construction of a contract initiated in an application signed by the plaintiff dated the 28th November, 1889, and a payment of $120 then made and receipt given therefor signed by the land commissioner of the defendant and culminating in a letter dated the 2nd of March, 1896, written by the land commissioner, by direction of the vice-president and managing director of the company in pursuance of which the plaintiff paid the balance of purchase money agreed upon in November, 1889, with interest. In the year 1887 a Mr. Trutch was appointed land commissioner of the company and under him was placed the transaction of all contracts for the sale of the company's lands which constituted a very extensive estate. The mode of dealing with persons desirous of purchasing lands of the company was as follows: Persons desirous of purchasing were required to make an application in writing to the land commissioner describing as best they could what piece of the unsurveyed land of the company they wished to purchase, and upon receipt of a first instalment the land commissioner gave a receipt therefor signed by himself stating the terms of the contract; and then an entry of the contract was made in books of the company kept for the purpose. Neither in this application nor in the land commissioner's receipt could the piece of land applied for be described with accuracy by reason of the land not being surveyed, and the practice therefore was this, that when a deed should come to be issued the purchaser was required to produce a survey of the premises for which upon being approved by the land commissioner the deed was issued. Now upon the 28th November, 1889, the plaintiff having selected a quarter section which he desired to purchase and having planted thereon, a post or stake to indicate that it was taken up made an application which he handed to Mr. Trutch, the land commissioner, at the offices of the company, which is as follows:\n28th November. 1889.\nThe description of a piece of land I wish to pre-empt or purchase. A piece of dry land and swamp situated in or about two miles west of Stark's place, Harwood Lake, Cranberry District, commencing at the top of a ridge, running west to Berkeley's Creek ; thence south down Berkeley's Creek to a corner post at a swamp ; then east, then north to the top of the ridge at the place of commencement. It is on or about two miles west, of Lower Harwood Lake, and about a mile or a mile and one-half or two miles from Donahue's claim and contains in or about 160 acres, it was formerly claimed by Mr. Stamp.\n(Sgd.) FRANK VICKER HOBBS.\nA price of $3 per acre was then agreed upon between the plaintiff and the land commissioner, and the plaintiff then paid to the land commissioner the sum of $120 and received from him a receipt in the terms following a copy of which the land commissioner retained:\nESQUIMALT & NANAIMO RAILWAY CO. LAND DEPARTMENT.\nVICTORIA, B.C., November 28th, 1889.\nReceived of Frank Vicker Hobbs the sum of one hundred and twenty dollars ($120.00) being a first payment on account of the purchase from the E. & N. Ry. Company of one hundred and sixty (160) acre of land in Bright District, at the price of three dollars ($3.00) per acre, commencing at a point about two (2) miles west of Louis Stark's Crown Grant in Cranberry District ; thence runniug west 40 chains to Berkeley's Creek ; thence south 40 chains ; thence east 40 chains ; thence north 40 chains to place of commencement ; the balance of purchase money to be paid in three equal instalments of seventy-five (75) cents an acre at the expiration of one, two and three years from date, with interest at the rate of six per cent per annum.\n(Sgd.) JOHN TRUTCH,\nLand Commissioner.\nThe contract was then entered in the land sales book of the E. & N. Railway Company by the gentleman who is now land commissioner of the company, but who was then bookkeeper in the land department. The entry is made as being on lot no. 6, in \"the Bright District,\" date of purchase, \"28th November, 1889,\" name \" Frank Vicker Hobbs.\" How acquired, \" by purchase.\" Acreage, \" 160 acres.\" Price, \"$3.00.\" Date when first payment made, \" 28th November, 1889.\" Amount paid, \" $120.\" Remarks, \" balance in three yearly payments of $120. \" Interest at 6 per cent.\" It was subsequently discovered that the land which the plaintiff had applied for was entered in the land book wrongly as being in \" the Bright District,\" and that in truth it was in a district desiguated by the company the Douglas District, and accordingly an entry was made in the land sales book in the Douglas District, as follows : 'Lot 6, in Douglas District, and all the other particulars transferred from the Bright District entry \" which latter was erased. In 1890 the plaintiff erected a log house upon the land as located by him, but did not reside upon the premises having gone into business instead. In the month of April, 1892, the plaintiff wrote the following letter :\nNANAIMO, 4th April, 1892.\nTo the E. & N. Railway Co's Land Agent:\nDEAR SIR,\u2014As I am about to survey the piece of land recorded by me on the 28th November, 1889, I wish to know who is your surveyor in this district. I am all alone out in that part and I do not know where the nearest corner post is, it is certainly a very long way from my claim and I can only survey from my post, about two miles from Louis Stark's Crown Grant. I have already paid $120 on it and I am anxious to survey and complete the purchase so an early reply would greatly oblige.\nYours faithfully,\nFRANK VICKER HOBBS.\nSawmill, Nanaimo, B.C.\nThis letter was received by a Mr. T. S. Gore who was then land commissioner of the defendants, and who by a letter addressed to the plaintiff replied to it as follows :\nESQUIMALT & NANAIMO RAILWAY CO. LAND DEPARTMENT.\nVICTORIA, B.C., April 6.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 4th instant in reference to your purchase of land in Douglas District. In reply I would say that you can employ any Provincial Land Surveyor you wish, probably Mr. Fry, of Duncan's, or Mr. Priest, of Nanaimo, would be the best.\nAs near as I can tell from your description of the location of the land in question the portion coloured red on the enclosed tracing will include what you describe in your application. In any case the survey will have to be made in such a way as to leave no fractional portions of land between yours and other claims in the neighbourhood.\nYours truly,\n(Sgd.) T. S. GORE,\nLand Commissioner.\nThe piece of land designated in this letter was inaccurate and was afterwards in 1-95 corrected by the company when by the log cabin which had been built by the plaintiff upon the land applied for by him they were enabled accurately to discern the quarter section applied for by the plaintiff and which now appears to be a piece of land designated by the company as lot no. 6, Douglas District.\nIn the month of May, 1894, Mr. Solly, the present land commissioner of the company was appointed to that office. In the fall of the year 1895, the plaintiff called upon the officers of the company in Victoria for the purpose of paying the balance due upon his purchase. Mr. Solly's account of this interview is as follows : He says that the plaintiff came to his office in the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Company's offices in November, 1895, and said that he wished to make a payment on some land in Douglas District, and that he informed the plaintiff that he could not accept any further payment on the land without further consulting Mr. James Dunsmuir, that he thereupon left the plaintiff in his office and went into the private room of Mr. James Dunsmuir, who was vice-president and managing director of the company. Now in the summer of 1895 coal was discovered in the neighbourhood of the land which the plaintiff had applied for. In the course of the prospecting for the coal so discovered the parties engaged therein came across the plaintiff's log cabin, and it was found to be on unsurveyed land of the company, but which neverthe- less was designated on their office plan as lot No. 6, in the Douglas District, and the cabin was marked by the company upon their plans as on that lot. Some little time prior to the plaintiff's calling on Mr. Solly, in November, 1895, the vice-president of the company had, Upon the discovery of coal in the neighbourhood, sent for Mr. Solly, the land commissioner, and called for the production of all plans and books containing entries and information relating to all purchases and pre-emptions in the neighbourhood. Mr. Solly produced them to him and gave him all the information he required. At that time the plaintiff's name appeared on the plan on lot No. 6, Douglas District, and the books showed him to be in arrear in his payments. Mr. Solly says that the vice-president was not in any doubt as to where the plaintiff's land was, that he, Solly, showed him that that was the lot which stood in the plaintiff's name, and that is the same piece which he now claims.\nMr. Solly having gone into the vice-president's room as above stated, upon the occasion of the plaintiff calling to pay the arrears of his purchase money, and having had an interview with the vice-president upon the subject, returned to his office and told the plaintiff that the company considered he had forfeited his right and interest by not making his payments, and he also told him that he expected that the amount the plaintiff had paid was also forfeited, whereupon the plaintiff left the office and placed the matter in the hands of his solicitors who entered into a correspondence with the company through their land commissioner upon the subject. There was a good deal of this correspondence, as Mr. Solly says, during which he had several coversations with the vice-president, and was at length instructed by Mr. Dunsmuir to see the plaintiff personally and to make some arrangement with him. Accordingly in February, 1896, Mr. Solly called on the plaintiff at his store in Victoria, and told him if he would come down to the company's office and talk the matter over with himself and Mr. Dunsmuir it was most likely it could be arranged. The plaintiff accordingly shortly afterwards went down to the company's office but nothing took place because Mr. Dunsmuir was not in and the plaintiff went away. What next occurred was the receipt by the plaintiff of the following letter from the land commissioner:\nESQUIMALT AND NANAIMO RAILWAY COMPANY.\nLAND DEPARTMENT, March 2nd, 1896.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014I am instructed to inform you that the railway company are now prepared to issue a conveyance to you of the land you agreed to purchase in Douglas District, providing that within two months from this date you have the land surveyed and the notes sent in to this office, and also pay up the overdue charges on the same which are as below. Kindly send me a line in reply to say if this arrangement will suit you.\nBy purchase of 160 acres of land in Douglas District.\nBalance of purchase money\n$360 00\nSix years simple interest at 6 per cent\n129 60\nTitle fee\n10 00\n$499 60\nYours truly,\n(Sgd.) LEONARD H. SOLLY,\nLand Commissioner.\nThe survey was accordingly made by a Mr. Priest, a land surveyor, who sent in his plan and field notes to the company, and in a letter dated April 11th, 1896, Mr. Solly informs the plaintiff that he had received the field notes from Mr. Priest, and that they are quite satisfactory, and \"a deed will be at once prepared on receipt of charges as stated in my letter to you of March 2nd.\"\nIn a letter dated 28th April, 1896, the plaintiff enclosed to the land commissioner his marked bank cheque for the balance of his purchase money as calculated in Mr. Solly's letter of March 2nd. The cheque was upon the Bank of British Columbia, and directed that the bank pay to the E. & N. Railway Company in full payment of purchase money for Lot 6, Douglas District, four hundred and ninety-nine 60\/100 dollars ($499.60), and was deposited by the company to their credit in the same bank. By a letter dated the 29th April, 1896, the land commissioner acknowledges receipt of the above cheque and adds,\nyour deed will be prepared at once and signed as soon as Mr. Dunsmuir returns to Victoria, which will be about ten days.\nAnd on the 8th May, 1896, he encloses to plaintiff the deed which the plaintiff refused to accept (and which constitutes the foundation of the present action) because of the reservations which are contained in it. The description therein contained as being a lot known as and numbered Lot 6, in the Douglas District upon the official map of the said district, a plan of which is annexed to the deed the plaintiff admits to be correct and to correspond with the land for which he made application in November, 1889, and upon which he paid his first instalment of $120.00. The error in describing the land applied for as being lot 6 in the \"Bright\" District was altogether an error of misdescription of Mr. Trutch's. The insertion of the word \"Bright\" instead of Douglas, was admitted by Mr. Trutch to have been a manifest error made by him, and it has always been known by the company to have been such.\nApart from that clerical error Mr. Priest who made the survey of land which has been accepted by both the company and the plaintiff as the land for which the plaintiff made application in 1889, says that the description in the receipt signed by Mr. Trutch in November, 1889, is as good a description as in the then unsurveyed condition of the country could have been given of the lot No. 6, in the Douglas District. That this was the land which the plaintiff had applied for is abundantly proved in evidence. On it were the log cabins erected by the plaintiff in 1890, then there is the evidence of one Murray and also of Mr. Priest, both of whom testify to their having been as far back as 1892 or 1893 a post planted on the lot within about 100 yards of its northern boundary as surveyed by Mr. Priest. This may reasonably be assumed to be the post which the plaintiff says he planted to indicate that the land upon which it was was taken up, but there is much other evidence to the like effect. Mr. Dunsmuir who has been vice-president of the company ever since its formation. tells us that the company was formed by his father to protect his own private coal interests ; that he took and the family still hold half of the capital stock and have the control of the company and of the directorship by arrangement made to that effect. \"We dont care\" he says, \"about telling those things, but we have the control, \"we have the majority of the directors,\" and he himself has always been managing director as well as vice-president. In fact from his evidence he appears to be substantially the company. He says \"every \"thing comes before my notice, any matter whether \"it is land or whatever it is.\" In answer to a question relating to his knowledge of the plaintiff's agreement, he said:\nYou see I know all these things; they will come to me and say, so and so has applied for such and such land in such and such a district, can I let them have it ? and they will bring a plan and I will say yes, or will say no ; that is the reason I know it; it all comes before me.\nHe was conversant with the transaction with the plaintiff in 1889 and knew that it related to the land in the Douglas District, and that it was a transaction of sale by the company ; he knew the contents of the receipt given to the plaintiff by Trutch, a copy of which was kept in the office. No other form of agreement until recently was ever entered into by the company; he plainly considered that receipt to constitute a contract for the sale of surface rights only. He said that in their office they treat \"surface\" as \"land.\" \"We do not\" he says, \" say \" surface rights, we say \"land,\" and by \"land\" they understand land without minerals\u2014that is to say they understand the minerals to be reserved. This was formerly the view of the company, but recently they have changed the form of receipts now given on contracts of sale, which expressly say that the amount paid is received on account of the purchase of \"surface rights.\" It was he, he said, who cancelled the plaintiff's agreement in 1895 when Mr. Solly after the discovery of coal in the neighbourhood came into his room and told him that the plaintiff wished to pay upon his land, but he afterwards relented and let him have it. Mr. Solly's letter of the 2nd of March, 1896, expresses the terms upon which he let him have it, namely, the payment for the land he had agreed to purchase in 1889, the balance of purchase money then agreed upon with interest and title fee.\nThen Mr. Solly, who was in the land commissioner's office from the beginning and has himself been land commissioner since May, 1894, says that the company never laboured under the slightest misapprehension as to the lot the plaintiff had applied for, they always knew that the land was in the Douglas District, and that the insertion of the word \" Bright\" District was a clerical error of Mr. Trutch's\u2014that all the dealings between the plaintiff and the company were in relation to land in the Douglas District, and to his application in 1889 ; that there never was but the one transaction with the plaintiff, and there never was any dispute about what land he was to have ; its precise boundaries, however, could not he stated until the survey should be made, and such survey was made by Priest and approved by the company, as appears by Mr. Solly's letter to the plaintiff of the date April 11th, 1896. The land so surveyed by Priest is that entered as lot No. 6, Douglas street in the company's book containing an entry of the original sale to the plaintiff in 1889, and on their plans, and is the land which the plaintiff always wanted to get, and expected to get, and the only dispute between the plaintiff and the company was as to the form of the coveyance tendered by the the company and the reservations therein. Mr. Trutch gave evidence that he was in the habit when giving receipts for purchase money similar to that given by him to the plaintiff to tell the purchasers that the company only sold surface rights, but he cannot say that he so told the plaintiff, and the latter swears positively that he did not, nor did he, the plaintiff, know nor had he heard such to be the practice of the company. We need not therefore inquire what effect such a statement should have if made to a purchaser to whom at the same time an express written contract for the sale of a piece of land containing no limitations or reservations whatever should be given.\nUpon the whole of the above evidence it is, I think, abundantly clear that the company through their officer having complete control and management of of all the company's affairs ratified and affirmed the transaction between the plaintiff and the land commissioner in November, 1889, as being a contract for the sale to the plaintiff of a quarter section of land designated by the company and known by them as lot No. 6 in the Douglas District, upon the terms mentioned in the receipt given by the land commis- sioner to the plaintiff for the first instalment of purchase money paid by him upon that lot, and not only did they ratify and affirm that transaction, but they did much more, for the letter of the 2nd March, 1896, written to the plaintiff by the express authority of the managing director and those of the 11th and 29th of April, and the receipt inclosed in the letter of the latter date for the balance of the purchase money while affirming the contract made with the plaintiff through the land commissioner in November, 1889, contain within themselves a complete contract for the sale by the company to the plaintiff of the lot No. 6 in Douglas District for which the company received from the plaintiff the purchase money in full as required by the company. Now with intent of fulfilling that contract the company executed under their corporate seal the deed sent to the plaintiff and which he refused to receive as a fulfilment of the contract made with him by reason of the reservations therein contained which he insists are not authorised by his contract, and so as I had said at the beginning the sole question to which the case is resolved is whether or not the reservations are authorised by the contract upon which the plaintiff has paid the balance of his purchase money in full, and this question I must say can, in my opinion, for the reasons I have given, be only answered in the negative, and the plaintiff is entitled to a decree directing the company to execute to the plaintiff a deed of the land specified in the deed already executed and tendered to the plaintiff, but without the reservations in that deed contained.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs, and a decree made in the terms above stated with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice King. KING J.\u2014The facts are stated in the judgment of the late Chief Justice Davie before whom the case was tried.\nIt is found by him that Mr. Trutch acted beyond the scope of his authority in agreeing to a sale of the land without reservation of the minerals. but that the contract so made was rectified by the company. He, however, was of opinion that, in so ratifying it, the company were under a mistake as to its legal effect, and upon this ground he declined to compel performance but left the plaintiff to his common law remedy for breach of contract.\nA first question is as to whether there was, by reason of the alleged mistake, a contract at all.\nIn Kennedy v. Panama Mail Co.[15], Blackburn J. says:\nWhere there has been an innocent misrepresentation or misapprehension, it does not authorize a rescission unless it is such as to shew that there is a complete difference in substance between what was supposed to be and what was taken, so as to constitute a failure of consideration.\nGompertz v. Bartlett[16], and Gurney v. Womersley [17], are instanced,\nwhere the person who has honestly sold what he thought a bill without recourse to him was nevertheless held bound to return the price on its turning out that the supposed bill was a forgery in the one case, and void under the stamp laws in the other ; in both cases the ground of decision being that the thing handed over was not the thing paid for.\nThe difficulty in every case is to determine whether the mistake or misapprehension is as to the substance of the whole consideration, going as it were to the root of the matter, or only to some point, even though a material point, an error as to which does not affect the substance of the whole consideration.\nIn Stewart v. Kennedy there were two separate appeals[18]. They were Scotch cases and the Scotch law (differing from the English) gives the right to specific implement or performance as an ordinary legal remedy. The first appeal was in an action by the vendee for (amongst other things) a declaration that the vendor was bound to implement the contract, and the sub-stantial question was whether it was an absolute or a conditional contract. This was decided adversely to the vendor. The second appeal was in an action brought by him for reducing or setting aside the contract upon the ground of essential error as to its absolute character. The Scotch court had held (Lord Shand dissenting) that the alleged error was not in the essentials of the contract, and hence not a ground for setting it aside. The House of Lords held that the error, if it existed, was one affecting the substance of the contract, and to that extent agreed with Lord Shand ; but that it did not (apart from any question as to the conduct of the respondent contributing to the error) entitle the appellant to have the contract set a side. Their lordships, however, considered that the appellant was entitled to an issue (rejected by the court below) as to alleged representations of respondent's agent\nIn the course of his opinion Lord Watson says (p. 121):\nWithout venturing to affirm that there can be no exceptions to the rule, I think it may be safely said that in case of onerous contracts reduced to writing, the erroneous belief of one of the contracting parties in regard to the nature of the contract which he has undertaken, will not be sufficient to give him the right (to rescind) unless such belief has been induced by the representations, fraudulent or not, of the other party to the contract. * * * Lord Shand held, I think rightly, that the error averred by the appellant is error in substantials. * * But Lord Shand goes a good deal further than holding that the appellant's error with reference to the nature of the contract of sale was an error in substantials. He expresses the opinion that the existence of such an erroneous belief in the mind of the appellant affords a sufficient ground for annulling the contract. So far as I can judge, his opinion rests upon the inference or assumption that in such a case there cannot be that duorum in idem placitum consensus atque conventio which is necessary to the constitution of a mutual contract. To give any countenance to that doctrine would in my opinion be to destroy the security of written engagements. In this case I do not think it has any foundation in fact. By delivering his missive offer to Mr. Glendinning (respondent's agent), the appellant represented to the respondent that he was willing to be bound by all its conditions and stipulations construed according to their legal meaning whatever that might be. He contracted, as every person does who becomes a party to a written contract, to be bound in case of dispute, by the interpretation which a court of law may put upon the language of the instrument.\nHere the parties were ad idem as to the terms of the contract. It was expressed in perfectly unambiguous language in the offer of the plaintiff and in the acceptance of defendants, and the alleged difference is in a wholly esoteric meaning which one of them gives to the plain words.\nThen the legal right existing (as held by the court below) is it a case (as also held by it) where a court of equity will leave the party aggrieved by a breach to his common law remedy ? As already mentioned, Stewart v. Kennedy[19] is not a case relating to the effect of mistake upon the exercise of the equitable jurisdiction of English Courts of Equity, but English authorities having been referred to, the jurisprudence is thus summarized by Lord Macnaghton (p. 105):\nIt cannot be disputed that the Court of Chancery has refused specific performance in cases of mistake when the mistake has been on one side only, and even when the mistake on the part of the defendant reisting specific performance, has not been induced or contributed to by any act or omission on the part of the plaintiff. But I do not think it is going too far to say that in all those cases\u2014certainly in all that have occurred in recent times\u2014the court has thought rightly or wrongly that the circumstances of the particular case under consideration were such that (to use a well known phrase) it would be \"highly unreasonable\" to enforce the agreement specifically.\nIn Tamplin v. James[20] James L J. says. If a man will not take reasonable care to ascertain what he is buying he must take the consequences. It is not enough for a purchaser to swear : \"I thought the farm sold contained twelve fields which I knew, and I find it does not include them all,\" or 'I thought it contained 100 acres and it only contains 80.\" It would open the door to fraud if such a defence was to be allowed. Perhaps some of the cases on this subject go too far (i.e. in the direction of allowing such defence) but for the most part the cases where a defendant has escaped on the ground of a mistake not contributed to by the plaintiff have been cases where a hardship amounting to injustice would have been inflicted upon him by holding him to his bargain and it was unreasonable to hold him to it.\nHence it may be, as stated in Fry on Specific Performance, that the court considers with more favour as a defence the allegation of mistake in an agent than in a principal\nThe alleged mistake is given in the evidence of Mr. Dunsmuir, the vice-president of the company. Speaking of the contract entered into by Mr. Trutch, he says :\nIt only sold the surface. That is, we term it land in our office. We do not say surface right, we say land, land minus the minerals.\nIt is evident then that we may put Mr. Trutch aside, and treat the case on this point as if the company, upon an application by plaintiff for purchase of the 160 acres of land, had entered into an agreement to sell the land in the identical words used by Mr. Trutch. In effect they say:\nWe agreed to sell the land, but this means land reserving the minerals.\nIt may well be that in the administration of their varied business a loose but convenient form of speech may have been used in the office, but it is not stated that it was supposed to be a correct one, and it appears incredible that a company, a large part of whose business is that of a land company, could reasonably suppose that in dealings with third persons for the sale of land, the word \" land \" means land with reser- vation of minerals. Mr. Trutch does not say that he misconceived the meaning of the word. His impression was that he had verbally notified the plaintiff that the minerals were to be reserved, and if he had done so the plaintiff would be precluded from obtaining the specific performance he seeks; but it has been found that notice was not given. The form of the company conveyances expressly reserving the minerals show that they were aware how to effect such object. The alleged mistake was therefore an unreasonable and careless one, and in view of the fact that the plaintiff went into possession under the contract, I do not think that it can be said to be unconscionable or highly unreasonable to enforce the specific performance of the contract.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.[21]\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

In the application for said policy the insured stated that he was sole owner of the property to be insured, and of the land on which it stood, whereas it was, to his knowledge, and that of the sub-agent who secured the application, situated upon the public highway.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, that as the application was more than once referred to in the policy it was a part of the contract for insurance, and that the misrepresentation as to the ownership of the land avoided the policy under the above condition.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts of the case are fully stated in the judgment of the court.\nWallace Nesbitt and C. J. Coster for the appellant The representation that the applicant was owner of the land was untrue, at the time the application for the insurance was made, to the personal knowledge of the applicant. He deliberately misrepresented this material fact in order to obtain the insurance, and concealed the circumstance of the building being upon the highway. The policy incorporates the application by reference and under its conditions this misrepresentation and breach of warranty avoided the insurance. We contend that a non-suit should be entered pursuant to leave reserved at the trial.\nReference is made to Sowden v. The Standard Fire Ins. Co.[1]; London Assurance v. Mansett[2], at pages 368-370; Draper v. Charier Oak Fire Ins. Co.[3]; Bitlington v. The Provincial Ins. Co. of Canada[4]; and Walking v. Rymill[5] with cases there collected.\nBaxter for the respondent. There is no special condition incorporating the application as part of the policy and it is not a warranty or part of the contract. The mention of an application made in the policy does not constitute an incorporation by reference; North British and Mercantile Ins. Co. v. McLellan[6]. The applicant had an insurable interest and made truthful statements to the company's agent who filled up the application and bound the company by his knowledge of the actual facts. The applicant did actually own the building and stock insured; Miller v. Alliance Ins. Co[7]. And even if he were on the highway without title, he would take a fee until dispossessed by some one; (see notes to Nepean v. Doe[8],); and he would be correctly described as owner. Even if the answer be treated as a warranty, it is strictly and technically fulfilled. On the other hand as a representation it was true \"so far as known to the applicant.\" See May on Ins. (2 ed.) sec. 284. See also Benson v. Ottawa Agricultural Ins. Co.[9], at page 293 per Harrison C.J.; Naughter v. Ottawa Agricultural Ins. Co.[10]; Graham v. Ontario Mutual Ins. Co.[11], at page 372; Sinclair v. Canadian Mutual Fire Ins Co.[12]; Ashford v. Victoria Mutual Assur. Co.[13]; Connely v. Guardian Ass. Co.[14], at page 327, per King J.; Hough v. City Fire Ins. Co.[15]; Curry v. Commonwealth Ins. Co.[16]; Stevenson v. London & Lancashire Ins. Co.[17], per Draper C.J. at page 152; O'Neill v. Ottawa Agricultural Ins. Co.[18].\nTreating the house as a chattel, LeBell's title to it and the rest of the personal property was that of sole owner. Williams Personal Property (10 ed.) pp. 8 and 37. Lingley v. Queen Ins. Co.[19].\nThere was evidence upon which the finding of the jury could be sustained and the court should consequently refuse to interfere.\nWe rely also upon the following authorities: Bean v. Stupart[20]; Fisher v. Crescent Ins. Co.[21]; Standard Life & Accident Ins. Co. v. Fraser[22]; Bawden v. The London, Edinburgh & Glasgow Assur. Co.[23]; Porter on Ins. p. 154, 155, 157-8, p. 159, 168, 455; Liverpool & London & Globe Ins. Co. v. Wyld[24]; Brogan v. Manufacturers Mul. Ins. Co[25].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014On the 31st August, 1896, the respondent insured his dwelling house and store, with the goods and stock in trade therein, with the appellant company for the sum of $1,430. On the 24th November, 1896, the property insured was burned and the company contested the loss. The case was tried before Mr. Justice McLeod and a jury, judgment being entered for the plaintiff.\nThis judgment was confirmed by the court en banc, Tuck C J. and Vanwart J. dissenting.\nAmong the conditions indorsed on the policy were the following:\n(1.) If an application, survey or plan or description of the property herein insured is referred to in this policy such application, survey, plan or description shall be considered a part of this contract and a warranty by the assured; and if any false representations be made by the assured of the condition, situation or occupancy of the property, or if there be any omission to make known every fact material to the risk, or an overvaluation, or any misrepresentation whatever, either in a written application or otherwise * * * then and in every such case this policy shall be void.\n(4.) If the interest of the assured in the property be any other than the entire, unconditional, and sole ownership of the property, for the use and benefit of the assured * * * it must be so represented to the society, and so expressed in the written part of this policy, otherwise the policy shall be void.\nThe application for insurance, by the first condition just set out made a part of the insurance contract, and a warranty, contained the following questions and answers:\nQ. Are you the sole owner of the property to be insured?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Are you the owner of the land on which the above described building stands?\u2014A. Yes.\nThe application, which was signed by the plaintiff in his own hand, contained at the foot the following clause:\nAnd the said applicant declares that the foregoing is a full and true exposition of all the facts and circumstances in regard to the property to be insured, so far as the same are known to the applicant, and that the annexed diagram (if any), shows all buildings or combustible materials within 150 feet of the property proposed for insurance, and agrees that the whole shall form the basis of the insurance contract. If the agent of the company fills up or signs this application, J he will in that case be the agent of the applicant, and not the agent of the company.\n(Sgd.) CHARLES LeBELL,\nMerchant.\nThe building was originally owned by Messrs. Ross & Company, of Quebec, who carried on large lumbering operations in the locality. They sold it to one Charles LaPoint with the understanding that it was to be removed from the property of Ross & Company, on which it then stood: LaPoint in pursuance of this arrangement moved it, not upon any land which he himself owned or had an interest in, but upon the edge of the travelled highway adjoining the property of Ross & Company, where it remained until it was burned. LaPoint subsequently died leaving a widow and several children, the widow in the following year, 1895, marrying the assured, Charles LeBell. Evidence is produced to show that she, then Mrs. LeBell, verbally gave the house to her husband upon condition that he should stay at home and support her family LeBell subsequently made an addition to the house and kept a small store, the goods in which together with the building forming the subject matter of the insurance in question in this case.\nThe only question open upon this appeal is as to whether there was such misrepresentation in the application for the insurance as would avoid the policy. The evidence upon the point is very short and is not contradicted, and the finding of the jury is in accordance with the evidence. One David McAllister was the local sub-agent of the company, the head agency for the province being in St. John, N.B. McAllister had no authority other than to receive and forward to the provincial head office any applications for insurance which he might receive from time to time. In fact the jury found that he acted as agent for the defendants only for the purpose of receiving applications. The evidence in regard to the alleged misrepresentation on the part of the assured is substantially uncontradicted, it being that of McAllister and the plaintiff. The former testifies that LeBell made application to him for an insurance on his building and stock; that subsequently he, McAllister, went to the house taking a blank application with him, and that he read over to him all the questions contained in the application. His evidence proceeds:\nQ. With reference to the first question\u2014can you remember the words you used in asking this question?\u2014A. I read this to LeBell and he said he was on the highway.\nQ. And to this, \"Are you the sole owner of the property to be insured?\u2014A. Yes; I read that question to him.\nQ. What was the answer?\u2014A. He said, \"Yes he was.\"\nQ. To the first part of the question\u2014are you the owner of the land on which the above described building stands. Did you read that to him?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. What reply did he make to you?\u2014A. He said he was on the highway.\nQ. Did you make any reply to that?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. What?\u2014A. I told him \"I will put you down in the application that the ground belongs to you.\"\nQ. And then you wrote this word \"yes\" in there?\u2014A. Yes.\nFrom this evidence it would clearly appear that both McAllister and the plaintiff had a clear idea of the fact that the latter was not the owner of the land on which the building stood, but that it was on the highway, and that they deliberately, for what object does not expressly appear, agreed in answering the question incorrectly. The plaintiff's evidence substantially agrees with that of McAllister.\nI asked McAllister (he swears), if he was an insurance agent. He told me he was, and I told him I would like to be insured, and he told me he would come up some day, so a few days afterwards he came to my place, and he asked me about the size of my building, and I measured it right before him, and I gave him the size, and he came into the store and he asked what was the stock, and I told him I thought I had $1,000 or $1,500, to the best of my knowledge. That is, $1,000 at cost.\nQ. And when you say $1,500 you mean selling price?\u2014A. Yes; be looked oyer it and thought it was all right, and he asked me about who owned the land where the building stood, and I told him it was on the public highway, and he said we will call it your own, and I said it was all right, and that was all said about it.\nMr. Justice McLeod in his judgment upon appeal gives this account of it:\nWhen he, the plaintiff, made his application to McAllister, in answer to the question in the application, \"Are you the owner of the land on which the above described building stands?\" he told McAllister that he was not, that the building stood on the highway. McAllister told him that the proper answer to that was \"Yes,\" and therefore in the application the answer was put down \"Yes.\"\nThe application after it was filled up and signed was sent by McAllister to the head office and the policy sued on was eventually returned.\nI am clearly of opinion that the statement made by the assured in answer to the question as to ownership of the land upon which the building was erected was a misrepresentation sufficient to avoid the policy. He was not, it would seem, an illiterate man; he knew perfectly well what he was saying and doing, and irrespective of McAllister altogether, he knew that he was putting his name to a false statement in regard to the ownership of the land. It is not necessary to inquire minutely as to what his object might be, but it seems patent that both he and the sub-agent must have had a strong suspicion that had the principal officers of the company known that the house to be insured was within the limits of the public highway, not indeed upon the roadway itself but within the fences and boundaries defining it from the adjoining land, they would have refused the risk. So that it was alike the interest of the sub-agent as well as of the plaintiff to make the misstatement. Neither has attempted in his evidence to make any explanation of the motives or objects they had in view prompting them to the extraordinary course they took, and to my mind the object I have suggested is the only one at all probable. It is clear to me they both participated with a view to their common benefit in misrepresenting the true facts upon a point most material to the company in determining upon the risk and the plaintiff must therefore bear the necessary consequences which such conduct involves.\nIt does not, therefore, appear to be necessary to discuss the effect of that clause in the application which purports to make the agent where he fills up the blanks in the application the agent of the assured instead of the agent of the company. Being in collusion for the purpose of perpetrating a fraud upon the company for their joint benefit neither of them can contend that McAllister was the company's agent for that purpose.\nAt the argument before us it was strongly contended that the application was not made part of the policy. But the answer to this contention is that the application is referred to in the policy more than once and the first condition of the policy makes the application if referred to in the policy a part of the contract as well as a warranty of the assured.\nWe are therefore of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, and that a non-suit should be entered pursuant to the leave reserved at the trial; the whole with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C J.

No one saw the accident, and it could not be ascertained how it occurred. In an action by his widow and infant children against the company the negligence charged was want of a fence or guard around the machinery, which caused the death of K., contrary to the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\nHeld, Gwynne J. dissenting, that whether the omission of such statutable duty could or could not form the basis of an action at common law, the plaintiffs could not recover in the absence of evidence that the negligence charged was the cause of the accident.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming by an equal division of opinion the judgment of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice[2] in favour of the plaintiffs.\nJames Kervin was killed in November, 1894, in one of the mills of the defendant company, in the town of Cornwall, being at the time in the employment of the company and charged with the duty of oiling all the machinery and attending to the water wheels, &c. The action was brought by the widow and children who claimed damages both in common law and under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. No one saw how the accident happened. Shortly after, however, his body was found lying face downward across one of the timbers referred to, about seven feet north of the journal or shaft of the northern pulley. The head was towards the west, the chest was on the timber. The deceased had been seen about ten or fifteen minutes before standing about thirty or thirty-five feet to the west of that place, with his oil can in his hand. On a post mortem examination, it was found that there was a bruise over the left temple; a cut on top and one on the back of the head; a fracture on the upper part of the sternum which was driven in upon the chest, evidently by some external violence; also fracture of four ribs on left side; there was also a compound fracture of both bones of the right leg, just above the ankle. In the opinion of the surgeon who performed the post mortem, death was caused by the body coming violently in contact with the beam on which it was found. The wounds in the head, he was of opinion, were caused by the head coming in contact with the brick work of the trench, where he himself and two others found some hair, and a part of the skin of the scalp, which, in his opinion, belonged to the deceased. The wound of the leg was probably caused, he said, by being caught in the large belt, before referred to.\nIt also appeared in evidence that there were two loose planks laid across the trench, over which the deceased and other servants in the defendant\u2019s employment had on two or three occasions crossed, in order to get from one side of the trench to the other, and that these planks were only three feet one or two inches below the upper belt, and that there was great danger in doing this, as a man would have to stoop down in order to pass clear under the belt; and further, that deceased had been told some weeks before his death by an overseer in the mill, that he should not pass over in that way\u2014that it was dangerous to do so\u2014and the planks were then removed, but appeared to be there at the time of the accident. But it was not in evidence that he had ever passed over in that way since the overseer had told him not to do so.\nA nonsuit was asked for and refused. The case having gone to the jury a verdict was found for the plaintiffs with $3,500 damages. The jury found that the company was neglectful in not having a fence or other guard at the place where the accident happened.\nThe verdict was affirmed by a majority of the Divisional Court[3], and by an equal division of opinion in the Court of Appeal[4]. The defendants then appealed to this court.\nOsler Q.C. and Pringle for the appellant. The plaintiffs are not entitled to a verdict at common law as the case cannot be distinguished from Wakelin v. London & South Western Railway Co.[5], and cases following it in this court. Montreal Rolling Mills Co. v. Corcoran[6]; George Matthews Co. v. Bouchard[7]. See also Dominion Cartridge Co. v. Cairns[8]; Tooke v. Bergeron[9]; Finlay v. Miscampbell[10].\nNor can plaintiffs recover under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Failure to comply with the provisions of that Act does not give rise to a cause of action, but merely subjects the owners of the factory to penalties. Wilson v. Merry[11] at page 341; Finlay v. Miscampbell10; Montreal Rolling Mills Co. v. Corcoran[12]. Moreover no notice was given within twelve weeks from the death of deceased as the Act requires, and there is no reasonable excuse for want of such notice. Moyle v. Jenkins[13]. And see also Rudd v. Bell[14]; Miller v. Reid[15].\nAylesworth Q.C. and Cline for the respondents. Wakelin v. London & South Western Railway Co.[16] is discussed in Beven on Negligence[17], and the principle governing this class of cases pointed out. The present case is easily to be distinguished from Wakelin\u2019s Case16.\nAs to the statutory duty to guard the revolving wheel, see Thomas v. Quartermaine[18], and as to notice Stone v. Hyde[19]; Cox v. Hamilton Sewer Pipe Co.[20] These cases decide that notice of intention to sue is sufficient.\nUnder the evidence plaintiffs could not have been nonsuited. See Fenna v. Clare Co.[21]; Moore v. Ransome\u2019s Dock Committee[22].\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed upon the grounds stated in the judgment of Osler J. in the Court of Appeal to which I desire to add nothing.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed for the reasons stated by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal.\nKING J.\u2014I concur in the judgment allowing the appeal. GIROUARD J.\u2014This is one of those unfortunate cases where a poor workman accidentally met his death while working in the factory of the appellants. As in Corcoran v. The Montreal Rolling Mills Co.[23] there is no witness to tell how the accident happened. The deceased was alone, and, as in the case of Corcoran, we are left to hypotheses, theories and conjectures, but as we laid down in that case, both under the civil law and the common law of England, it is not upon mere suppositions that the legal responsibility of the master towards his employees or their heirs can rest. Upon the authority of Wakelin v. London & South Western Railway Co.[24], we decided that all cases of this kind involve the determination of two essential facts; 1st, negligence on the part of the master, and 2nd, that that negligence was the cause of the injury to the employee. Without satisfactory evidence of both these facts, there is no case to go to the jury.\nThe jury found against the company upon both facts, the negligence consisting in the want of fence or guard round the machinery which caused the death of deceased, contrary to the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of Ontario.\nThe trial judge refused a non-suit. In the Divisional Court, Boyd C. and Robertson J. were of the same opinion, Meredith J. dissenting. In appeal the court was equally divided, Burton C.J. and Maclennan J. for the appellants, Osler and Falconbridge JJ. contra.\nWithout deciding that the omission of a statutable duty can create a civil liability on the part of the owner and be the basis of an action at common law, we have no hesitation in agreeing with the learned Chief Justice of Ontario that there is no evidence whatever that the negligence imputed to the appellant was the cause of the accident, and that conse- quently the action, whether considered at common law or under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, must be dismissed.\nThe appeal is allowed with costs in all the courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Leitch & Pringle.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Maclennan, Liddell & Cline.\n[1] 25 Ont.

Salvas v. Vassal, (27 Can. S. C. R. 68) followed.\nThe locatee of certain Crown lands sold his rights therein to B, reserving the right to redeem the same within nine years, and subsequently sold the same rights to M., subject to the first deed. These deeds were both registered in their proper order in the registry office for the division and in the Crown Lands Office at Quebec. M. paid the balance of Crown dues remaining unpaid upon the land and made an application for letters patent of grant thereof in which no mention was made of the former sale by the original locatee. In an action by scirefacias for the annulment of the letters patent granted to M.,\nHeld, Taschereau J dissenting that the failure to mention the vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 in the application for the letters patent was a misrepresentation and concealment which entitled the Crown to have the grant declared void and the letters patent annulled as having been issued by mistake and in ignorance of a material fact notwithstanding the registration of the first deed in the Crown Land Office. Fonseca v. Attorney General for Canada, (17 Can. S.C.R. 612) referred to. Held further, Taschereau J., dissenting, that it is not necessary that such an action should be preceded or accompanied by tender or deposit of the dues paid to the Crown in order to obtain the issue of the letters patent.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, appeal side, reversing the decision of the Superior Court, District of Because, and maintaining as valid the letters patent of which the annulment had been sought upon scire facias.\nThe facts are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment of the majority of the court delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard.\nFitzpatrick Q.C. (Solicitor General for Canada) and Lane for the appellant. The deed to Beaudoin in 1888 is a vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 and the decision in Salvas v. Vassal ([1]) rules. The letters patent were obtained through false and fraudulent representations and the concealment of material facts and issued by mistake and inadvertence. The vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 of 1888 vested all the rights and title of the original locatee in Beaudoin ; art. 1553 C. C. ; and consequently, that deed being still in force, nothing passed to the respondent under the deed of 1889. The deed of 1888 was of record in the County Registry Office ; respondent had agreed to hold the land subject to it and yet suppressed all mention of it in the application for patent.\nSee Casgrain v. Caron ([2]) ; Bourque v. Lupien ([3]). The want of delivery of possession to Beaudoin does not alter the character of his deed ; arts. 1025, 1027, 1472 C. C. ; it cannot be a pledge ; arts. 1966, 1967, 1970 C. C. See also Laurin v. Lafleur ([4]) ; Attorney General of Quebec v. Morin ([5]) ; The Queen v. Normand ([6]). We refer also to the Ontario cases on scire facias cited in Fonseca v. Attorney General for Canada ([7]). Chase-Casgairi Q.C. and L. Taschereau Q.C. for the respondent. There was no concealment or fraudulent misrepresentation but, on the contrary, the application made special reference to the deed of 1888 as a lien upon the lands, and thus the case is distinguished from those cited by the appellant. We are not chargeable with fraud and must have all presumptions in our favour for the honour of the Crown. The action itself is bad for want of a tender before or with the action, to reimburse the Crown dues paid by respondent. Cridiford v. Bulmer ([8]) ; Waterous Engine Works Co. v. Collin ([9]) ; Lenfiieux v. Bourassa ([10]) ; Filiatrault v. Goldie ([11]). The fling and registration of the deed of 1888 in the Crown Lands Office charges the Crown with notice of the full text of the instrument which the applicant called a lien or hypothec, and which is in fact nothing more ; art. 1546 C. C. ; Troplong \" Nantissement,\" p. 40. n. 39 ; this was the meaning and intention of the parties as disclosed by the evidence. See Salvas v. Vassal ([12]) at pages 77 and 81 by their Lordships the Chief Justice and Girouard J.\nTaschereau J. (dissenting).\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. I agree with the Court of Appeal that the appellant has entirely failed to prove the allegations of facts in his declaration. There is no evidence of fraud, or of fraudulent concealment by the respondent. Under arts. 1274 to 1280 of the Revised Statutes, he was the only one entitled to the letters patent in question. On this ground I am of opinion that the action of the Attorney General was rightly dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. I also agree that the following remarks of Mr. Justice Ouimet in rendering the judgment of the court\nil ne me reste qu'\u00e0 ajouter que dans l'opinion de cette Cour, le d\u00e9faut d'offrir \u00e0 l'appelant le remboursement de ce qu'il a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 Ia Couronne pour obtenir les lettres patentes et acquitter les arr\u00e9rages dos sur le terrain conc\u00e9d\u00e9 serait \u00e9galement et quand m\u00eame fatal \u00e0 Ia pr\u00e9sente action,\nare conclusive and that under any circumstances the plaintiff's action could not be maintained.\nIf the Attorney General had proceeded under articles 1283 and following of the Revised Statutes the monies paid by the respondent to the Crown for his letters patent would have been forfeited. But, in a common law action the Crown is bound by the common law, and the maxim that \" il n'est permis \u00e0 personne de s'enrichir aux d\u00e9pens d'autrui,\" must receive its application here. It is upon that principle that the Court of Queen's Bench held in Charlebois v. Charleboss ([13]), that a plaintiff who asks that a deed of transaction be set aside must offer with his action to restore the money he has received as a consideration for the said transaction. Upon the ground only that the plaintiff had not tendered and deposited in court the money she had so received the appeal in that case was allowed and her action dismissed. The Superior Court had disposed of that objection by reserving the respondent's recourse to recover back this money. But the Court of Appeal rightly held that it is by his action that a plaintiff under these circumstances has to tender back the money.\nIn Filiatrault v. Goldie ([14]), the Court of Queen's Bench upon the same principle, dismissed an action whereby a vendor who had received part of the price of sale asked to have that sale set aside but without tendering the amount he had received. The judgment annealed from had ordered the dissolution of the sale upon the plaintiff reimbursing what he had received, but the Court of Queen's Bench reversed that judgment, holding, and rightly holding, that the action in such a case wholly fails if not preceded or accompanied by the tender and deposit of the money received.\nThe cases of Lemieux v. Bourassa ([15]) and Cridiford V. Bulmer ([16]), have been determined by the same court, upon the same principle.\nIn fact the jurisprudence is uniform. Not a single case to the contrary has been cited by the appellant. And, as was held in Filiatrault v. Goldie ([17]), a special plea is not necessary to enable a defendant to avail himself of the objection to the plaintiff's right of action upon that ground. A general denegation is sufficient. In fact where by the declaration the payment to plaintiff appears, the action would be dismissed on demurrer.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by :\nGirouard J.\u2014Il s'agit de la validit\u00e9 de lettres patentes d'une concession de terre de Ia Couronne situ\u00e9e dans la paroisse de Saint-Evariste de Forsyth comt\u00e9 de Beauce province de Qu\u00e9bec. Elles furent octroy\u00e9es par le department des terres \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec le 7 juillet 1897 en faveur de l'intim\u00e9, qui en fit la demande quelques mois avant. Le procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de Louis Napol\u00e9on Beaudoin et Louis Th\u00e9odule Beaudoin, en demande l'annulation, par bref de scire facias, all\u00e9guant qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mises par erreur et dans l'ignorance d'un fait essentiel caqu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9, contrairement \u00e0 l'article 1034 de l'ancien code de Proc\u00e9dure reproduit \u00e0 l'article 1007 du nouveau code. La cour de premiere instance (H. C. Pelletier J.) se pronon\u00e7a cont\u00e9e l'intim\u00e9, mais ce jugement fut infirm\u00e9 par la cour d'appel.\nEn 1862, Cyrille Beaudoin, p\u00e8re, obtient de la couronne un billet de location du lot 15 A. du cadastre du canton de Forsyth. Il est admis qu'il remplit toutes les conditions d'\u00e9tablissement voulues par la loi et les r\u00e8glements ; mais, probablement parce qu'il restait une petite balance \u00e0 payer sur le prix d'achat, il ne demanda pas de lettres patentes. Apr\u00e8s plus de vingt-cinq and de possession par lui-m\u00eame et son pr\u00e9, Cyrille Beaudoin fils vend l'immeuble \u00e0 deux acheteurs diff\u00e9rents, d'abord, le 13 f\u00e9vrier, 1888, \u00e0 Wenceslas Beaudoin (mais non son parent), l'auteur des requ\u00e9rants, pour $300, et ensuite le 27 octobre, 1889, \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, pour $217. Les deux titres sont notari\u00e9s parfaits \u00e0 leur face et furent d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9s.\nLa premi\u00e8re vente contient une stipulation de rachat con\u00e7ue dans ces termes ;\nLe vendeur aura, pendant neuf ann\u00e9es \u00e0 compter de ce jour la jouissance et usufruit de l'immeuble ci-dessus vendu et des b\u00e2tisses sus-\u00e9rig\u00e9es pourvu qu'il le cultive en bon pere de famille ; qu'il entretienne les b\u00e2tisses en bon \u00e9tat de r\u00e9parations; qu'il paye les taxes et cotisations municipales, scolaires et autres obligations auxquelles l'immeuble sus-d\u00e9sign\u00e9 est tenu et oblige, ou pourra \u00eatre tenu et oblig\u00e9 a l'avenir, de plus qu'il paye au dit sieur Wenceslas Beaudoin, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat annuel sur Ia dite somme de trois cents piastres au taux de huit pour cent par an \u00e0 compter de ce jour.\nEn outre, le vendeur se r\u00e9serve pendant le m\u00eame d\u00e9lai de neuf ann\u00e9es \u00e0 compter de ce jour, le droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 et de rentrer en la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'immeuble et b\u00e2tisses sus-d\u00e9sign\u00e9s en remboursant \u00e0 l'acqu\u00e9reur wenceslas Beaudoin la dite somme de trois cents piastres avec tous les int\u00e9r\u00eats dus et \u00e9chus sur icelle mais le dit d\u00e9lai de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 expire si le vendeur n'a pas fait le remboursement de Ia dite somme de trois cents piastres et les int\u00e9r\u00eats dus sur icelle, et m\u00eame si un mois apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de chaque ann\u00e9e, le vendeur n'a pas pay\u00e9 tous les dits int\u00e9r\u00eats, ou encore si le vendeur commet des d\u00e9gradations sur le dit immeuble et b\u00e2tisses sus-\u00e9rig\u00e9es ou les d\u00e9t\u00e9riore par et de quelque mani\u00e8re que ce soit, alors et dans ces cas, le dit vendeur Cyrille Beaudoin ser\u00e1 d\u00e9chu de son droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, l'acqu\u00e9reur demeurera propri\u00e9taire incommutably de la dite terre et des b\u00e2tisses sus-\u00e9rig\u00e9es et pourra entrer en la possession d'icelles. \u00a1sans aucune formalit\u00e9 de justice et sans \u00eatre tenu d'indemniser en quoi que ce soit le dit vendeur.\nL'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que le titre de Wenceslas Beaudoin est imparfait, en ce qu'il stipule une facult\u00e9 de rachat ; mais celui de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9galement en contient une de cinq ans et ii est post\u00e9rieur, quant \u00e0 la date et l'enregistrement, \u00e0 celui des requ\u00e9rants, qui, par cons\u00e9quent, lui est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable. Nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans Salvas v. Vassal ([18]) que les ventes \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e9taient de v\u00e9ritables ventes translatives de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nL'acte de vente dont ii est question dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, va beaucoup plus loin que celui dans Salvas y. Vassal (1). Il y est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nAu cas o\u00f9 l'acqu\u00e9reur viendra \u00e0 prendre possession de la dite terre et b\u00e2tisses, et que le prix d'icelles serait insuffisant pour rembourser au dit acqu\u00e9reur Ia susdite somme de trois cents piastres et tons les int\u00e9r\u00eats produits par icelles, le dit acqu\u00e9reur se r\u00e9serve son recours contre le vendeur pour Ia balance lui revenant sur Ia dite somme et les frais faits pour la recouvrer.\nIl est loisible aux parties d'apposer \u00e0 leur contrat telles charges et conditions qui ne sont pas incompatibles avec sa nature. Il est \u00e9vident que dans l'esp\u00e8ce qui nous occupe, comme presque toujours d'ailleurs le cr\u00e9ancier n'a eu recours \u00e0 la vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 que pour \u00e9viter les longueurs et les frais d'une vente judiciaire et mieux assurer ses avances d'argent ; mais comme nous le disions dans Salvas v. Vassal (1), il n'y a aucune loi qui prohibe ces conventions. Le seul point \u00e0 constater est de savoir s'il v a eu ali\u00e9nation. Ici comme dans Salvas v. Vassal (1) l'acte le dit en toutes lettres. La clause par laquelle le vendeur garantit que l'immeuble vaut le prix pay\u00e9 et que la vente en rapportera le montant n'a rien d'incompatible avec la vente. Il est vrai que le titre de l'intim\u00e9 fait mention de celui de Wenceslas Beaudoin comme \u00e9tant simplement une obligation hypoth\u00e9caire, mais il lui \u00e9tait facile de se renseigner au Bureau d'Enregistrement ; s'il ne l'a pas fait, c'est sa faute et il doit en subir les cons\u00e9quences.\nLe 7 juillet 1897 l'intim\u00e9 obtient les lettres patentes, en produisant son titre o\u00f9 celui des requ\u00e9rants appara\u00eet comme simple hypoth\u00e8que, bien qu'il en connut le v\u00e9ritable caract\u00e8re et sans en informer le d\u00e9partement des terres. C'\u00e9tait un fait essentiel dont l'ignorance a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause de l'\u00e9mission des lettres patentes qui doivent, pour cette raison, \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9es, quand bien m\u00eame il ne serait pas prouv\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 a sciemment et frauduleusement caqu\u00e9e ce fait essentiel Il suint de prouver l'erreur et l'ignorance de ce fait de la part de la Couronne. C. P. C. art. 1007 par. 2. C'est le principe qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par cette cour dans une cause analogue, en interpr\u00e9tation de semblables dispositions qui ont force de loi dans tout le pays. Fonseca v. The Attorney General of Canada ([19]), aux pages 650-651.\nIl y a plus dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. La mauvaise foi de l'intim\u00e9 au moment o\u00f9 il demanda les lettres patentes, est admise par lui m\u00eame :\nQ. Quand est-ce que vous avez su que c'\u00e9tait une vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 et non une hypoth\u00e8que qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 consente?\u2014R. Je lai su que le printemps, quand Cyrille Beaudoin est parti, en mil huit cent quatre vingt-seize (1896).\nQ. Quand vous avez su que c'\u00e9tait une vente a r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 les Lettres Patentes n'\u00e9taient pas \u00e9mises ?\u2014R. Non, monsieur.\nL'intim\u00e9 savait m\u00eame que les requ\u00e9rants n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9s des deniers qui leur \u00e9taient dus en vertu de la vente du 13 juillet 1888. Le 16 juillet 1896, il \u00e9crit \u00e0 l'un d'eux qu'il Salt qu'ils ont une vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 de trois cents piastres. Seriez-vous assez bon d'accepter les trois cents piastres avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats de trois ans qu'ils m'ont dit n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s.\nEn tout et partout, de 1888 \u00e0 1892, Cyrille Beaudoin n'avait pay\u00e9, en quatre versements, que $155. Le 13 juillet 1896 ii devait done huit ann\u00e9es d'int\u00e9r\u00eat, savoir $192 \u00e9tant arri\u00e9r\u00e9 de plus d'une ann\u00e9e d'int\u00e9r\u00eats sans parler des taxes municipales, des cotisations scolaires, et des r\u00e9partitions pour la construction de l'\u00e9glise, pay\u00e9es par les requ\u00e9rants. Cyrille Beaudoin \u00e9tait alors en d\u00e9faut ; et un mois apr\u00e8s le 13 juillet 1896, et m\u00eame en 1895 aux termes de l'acte ii \u00e9tait d\u00e9chu de l'exercice de la facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'il y avait stipul\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9, qui est aux droits de Cyrille Beaudoin (C. C. art. 1553), ne pouvait done pas demander en 1897 \u00e0 \u00eatre reconnu le propri\u00e9taire incommutably de l'immeuble en question.\nCe qui d\u00e9montre davantage la mauvaise foi de l'intim\u00e9, c'est la production qu'il fit an d\u00e9partement des terres d'un certificat du garde-forestier qu'il avait occup\u00e9 le lot en question \"deepuis dix-huit ans,\" tandis qu'il est en preuve, admise par lui m\u00eame, qu'il ne fut jamais en possession et qu'il n'en paya jamais les taxes et redevances, qui furent sold\u00e9es par Cyrille Beaudoin ou les requ\u00e9rants\nL'intim\u00e9 invoque les articles 1279 et suivants des Statuts R\u00e9vis\u00e9s de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, concernant les registres du department des terres et l'effet des transports qui y sont inscrits. Mais ces dispositions n'ont pas l'effet de faire dispara\u00eetre celles du Code de Proc\u00e9dure concernant l'annulation des lettres patentes, qui demeurent en pleine force.

Enfin, l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que la pr\u00e9sente action ne peut \u00eatre maintenue, parce que la Couronne ne lui offre pas le remboursement de ce qu'il lui a pay\u00e9 pour obtenir les lettres patentes et acquitter les arr\u00e9rages dus sur le terrain conc\u00e9d\u00e9.

The bridge being threatened with destruction by the spring floods the mill foreman called for volunteers to attempt to save it by undertaking manifestly dangerous work in loading one of the piers with stone. While the work was in progress the bridge was carried away by the force of the waters and. one of the volunteers was drowned. In an action by the widow for damages:\nHeld, Gwynne J. dissenting, that the maxim v violent non fit injuries\" did not apply, as the case was one in which both the mill owner and deceased were to blame, and that, being a case of common fault, the damages should be divided according to the jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, appeal side ([1]), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Three Rivers, by which a verdict had been entered in favour of the plaintiff for damages incurred in consequence of the death of her husband\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note, and in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard.\nStuart Q. C. and Olivier for the apellan\nR. S. Cooke for the respondent. TASCHEREAU J.\u2014I do not dissent but, had the result of this judgment depended upon my conclusions, I would have greatly hesitated before reducing the amount given to the respondent by the courts below. The appellant's right to have the damages reduced by saying i it is true I ordered the deceased to go upon that bridge, but he should have disobeyed my orders,\" seems to me doubtful. If as now held he, the appellant was guilty of imprudence in ordering the deceased to go upon that bridge on the occasion in question, it seems to me that the judgment should stand for the whole amount. Should he not be estopped from invoking the obedience to his orders as a ground to oppose wholly or partly the respondent's claim?\nGWYNNE J. (dissenting.)\u2014However much entitled to sympathy the family of the brave young man who lost his life when exposing it to such manifest danger in the interest of the appellant is, I do not, with great deference think that the case can be regarded as raising any question of negligence on the part of the appellant, or of contributory negligence on the part of the deceased. The case is rather one in which the deceased quite voluntarily, at the suggestion of his father, who was in the employment of the appellant, exposed his life to very manifest danger by entering upon the bridge which was perishing by the force of the waters of the stream over which it was built in the forlorn hope of presentan its absolute destruction He may have been guilty of rashness but not of negligence. The latter term is not applicable to the case. The risk he was running was quite apparent to himself and to everyone present, but he was under no obligation whatever to undertake the risk and expose himself to such manifest danger. The case, in my judgment is a plain case for the application of the principle volenti non fit injuria, and therefore the appeal should be wholly allowed with costs, and the action in the court below dismissed.\nSedgewick J\u2014I am opinion that the appeal should be in part allowed by reducing the judgment as specified in the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Girouard. I concur with him also as to the disposition of the costs.\nKing J. concurred in the judgment reducing the damages to nine hundred dollars with interest from the 22nd of April 1898 and with costs incurred in the Superior Court, and also that each of the parties should bear their respective costs in the Court of Queen's Bench and the Supreme Court of Canada.\nGirouard J.\u2014Il s'agit encore de la responsabilit\u00e9 du patron envers l'ouvrier. L'appelant est propri\u00e9taire d'un moulin \u00e0 scie et d'un pont surla rivi\u00e8re Batiscan, dans la paroisse de Saint Stanislas. Lors de la d\u00e9b\u00e2cle en avril 1897 l'eau est mont\u00e9e \u00e0 une hauteur qu'on n'avait jamais vue depuis pr\u00e9s de trente ans.

A la vue de ce danger, les repr\u00e9sentants de l'appelant dernandent \u00e0 des hommes de bonne volont\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement employ\u00e9s \u00e0 leur \u00e9tablissement, de venir sauver la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de leur maitre, en consolidant un d\u00e9sileras Trois hommes s'offrent entartres G\u00e9d\u00e9on Trudel, le fils du contrema\u00eetre qui dirigeait les travaux.

L'appelant est-il responsable de cet accident ? Il est admis quo l'ouvrage \u00e9tait dangereux, mais tout le monde connaissait le danger, le d\u00e9funt comme les autres.

R., received from the others a deed conveying to him the entire title in the land in consideration of his paying all debts against the intestate estate and those of a deceased brother. Subsequently W. R. borrowed money from his sister and gave her a deed of the land, on learning which B., a creditor of W. R., accused the latter of fraud and threatened him with criminal prosecution, whereupon he induced his sister to execute a reconveyance of the land to him and then gave a mortgage to B. The re-conveyance not having been properly acknowledged for registry purposes, was returned to the sister to have the defect remedied, but she had taken legal advice in the meantime and destroyed the deed. B. then brought an action against W. R. and his sister to have the deed to the latter set aside and his mortgage declared a lien on the land.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (30 N. S. Rep. 405), that the sister of W. R. was entitled to a first lien on the land for the money lent to her brother; that the deed of re-conveyance to W. R. had been obtained by undue influence and pressure and should be set aside, and B. should not be allowed to set it up.\nB. claiming to be a creditor of the father and deceased brother of the defendants wished to enforce the provision in the deed to W. R. by his brothers and sister for payment of the debts of the father and brother.\nHeld, that this relief was not asked in the action, and if it had been the said provision was a mere contract between the parties to the deed of which a third party could not call for execution, no trust having been created for the creditors of the deceased father and brother. Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note and in the judgments published herewith.\nSedgewick and Congdon for the appellant.\nDrysdale Q.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The appellant, who was the plaintiff in the action, founds his claim upon a mortgage of certain lands situate at Musquodoboit, in the county of Halifax, which was executed in his favour by the respondent William Rhind, on the 26th of February, 1896, to secure the sum of $718. The amount of the alleged mortgage debt was, according to the statement of the appellant, made up of debts due to him by William Rhind himself, and by his father, Alexander Rhind, and his brother, George Rhind. Alexander Rhind, the father of the respondents, was in his lifetime seized in fee of the land in question. He died in 1877, intestate, leaving a widow and several children, amongst others George Rhind, the eldest son, and the respondents William and Caroline Rhind. Upon the death of Alexander, George Rhind, the eldest son, took the management of the farm and carried it on supporting his mother and the younger children out of the proceeds. The respondent William, then seventeen years of age, \u2022 remained at home. The respondent, Caroline, some time after her father's death went to Boston to earn her own livelihood George died in 1890, also, as appellant alleges, indebted to him. After George's death William undertook the working of the farm, and up to the date of the action provided for the maintenance of his mother and the younger children. On the 28th of June, 1890, a deed was executed by which his brothers and sisters conveyed the land in question to William Rhind, who was at that time not quite twenty years of age. In this deed it was expressed to be made\nin consideration of William Rhind paying all the debts due and owing by the late George Rhind, and discharging all debts against the estate of the late Alexander Rhind as they may become due and demandable.\nWilliam finding himself straitened in means for the support of his mother and the family, appealed for assistance to his sister Caroline who from time to time remitted him money, and none of the previous remittances having been repaid, William, in December, 1895, being much pressed, applied to his sister for a further advance of $200. In answer to this application Caroline remitted her brother, about the 10th of January, 1896, $120, which with the previous loans made up a sum of $450, for which William Rhind on the 16th of February, 1896, gave his sister security by executing in her favour an absolute deed of the land in question. This deed having been registered was in some way brought to the notice of the appellant, to whom, according to appellant's own statement, William Rhind was then in debt to the amount of $315.28. The appellant immediately applied to William to obtain a re-conveyance from his sister Caroline, and then to secure the appellant by a mortgage William Rhind in his deposition swears that the appellant accused him of fraud and threatened to prosecute him criminally unless he complied with his demand. The appellant it is true denies this, but I am satisfied from a perusal of the evidence that the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia were entirely right in holding, as they do in the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Graham, that undue pressure and influence was exercised by the appellant, who was a country merchant, a postmaster, and apparently an experienced man of business, and who was accompanied by one Henry Cruickshanks, who also appears to have exerted himself in the appellant's behalf, and to have intimidated the respondent William, an inexperienced country bred lad. Under this influence William wrote to his sister Caroline reporting to her the threats which had been made by the appellant and Cruickshanks, and urging her to execute a re-conveyance to him. Influenced by the threats of the appellant thus communicated to her by William, Caroline executed a deed by which she purported to re-convey to William the land in question, and on this deed reaching William he executed the mortgage to the appellant, on which the present action is based. The conveyance from Caroline not having been sufficiently acknowledged for registry, was returned to her in order that an acknowledgment in proper form might be made. Upon thus regaining possession of the deed Caroline Rhind took legal advice in Boston, and acting on it refused to return the deed, and not only withheld it, but very improperly destroyed it. The appellant then brought this action claiming to set aside the deed from William to. Caroline, and for a declaration that his mortgage is a lien on the lands.\nCaroline Rhind counterclaims for a declaration that she is entitled to a first lien on the property for her debt of $450 and interest, and also that the deed by which she purported to re-convey the land to William should be set aside. The learned judge before whom the action was tried having pronounced a judgment in favour of the appellant, this judgment was on appeal to the Supreme Court in banc discharged and a judgment entered in favour of Caroline Rhind, as prayed by her counterclaim, and the appellant was also restrained from setting up the deed of re-conveyance or release. And subject to these declarations and directions, the action was dismissed.\nI am of opinion that the decree appealed against was in all respects right. The execution of the re-conveyance was beyond all doubt upon the evidence obtained by undue influence and fraudulent pressure, and that deed could not have been allowed to stand without an entire disregard of the principles upon which courts of equity act in such cases. I do not go into the evidence with any particularity for we may well adopt in its entirety the judgment which Mr. Justice Graham delivered for the court.\nAs something was said at the argument as to enforcing the provision in the deed by which the land was conveyed to William, and by which it was stated that the consideration was the payment of the debts of Alexander and of George, it is as well to point out why no relief such as that thus suggested can be given in this action.\nIn the first place, no case is made for it in the statement of claim. Then this provision is one entirely \"res inter alios\" as regards the appellant, the benefit of which the appellant is not entitled to avail himself of. It created no trust for the creditors of Alexander and George, but was a mere contract between the parties to the deed, and the respondents are entitled to invoke the well known rule, thoroughly established in equity as well as at law, that a mere contract enures to the benefit exclusively of the party from whom the consideration moves; Tweddle v. Atkinson[2]; Colyear v. Lady Mulgrave[3]; and that no third party however directly a covenant or contract may appear to be designed for his benefit can call for its execution. To give the appellant any relief on this head would be to violate this well established rule of law.\nThere is no doubt that the whole of the land was originally assets available for the payment of the debts of Alexander Rhind, and that the undivided share of George according to the number of children of Alexander was also available for the payment of his own debts, and if there remain any of these debts still unbarred by the statute of limitation (which as the statute began to run on the lives of the original debtors is not very probable; Rhodes v. Smethurst[4],) such creditors may possibly still make the land available for their payment. But this can only be done in an action properly constituted for that purpose, and not in the present action.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred.\nGWYNNE J\u2014The facts upon which the judgment upon this appeal must rest appear to be that in 1877, one Alexander Rhind died intestate seized in fee of a farm situate at Musquodoboit, in the county of Halifax, in the province of Nova Scotia, containing about 100 acres, and leaving him surviving a widow and two sons, George, and the defendant William, who was then only six years of age, and of some daughters, of whom the defendant Caroline was one. Alexander also left some chattels consisting of some farm stock, and implements, and household effects, but no letters of administration of his estate appear to have been taken out although he left some debts. His widow with her family continued to reside upon the farm which was worked by George, the eldest son. The defendant Caroline, in 1882, left home and went to reside at Boston, in the State of Massachusetts, where she has ever since resided, maintaining herself. George during his life purchased 100 acres or thereabouts, which he added to the farm, and of which early in 1890, he died seized, intestate and unmarried. During the latter years of George's life he was in delicate health, but with the assistance of the defendant William, who at George's death was about nineteen years of age, he managed to continue working the farm and maintaining their mother. In the year 1888, and from thence until George's death, the defendant Caroline having prospered in life advanced and lent from time to time to George divers sums of money amounting in the whole to $225, a portion of which, amounting to about $130, was advanced to him for the purpose of being applied and was applied in payment of a debt or debts of their father Alexander. No letters of administration of the estate and effects of George Rhind appear to have been taken out, but upon the 28th of June, 1890, the heirs of George, who were also the heirs of Alexander Rhind by a deed executed by them, the consideration of which was stated to be one dollar, and\nin consideration of William Rhind paying all debts due and owing by the late George Rhind and discharging all debts against the estate of the late Alexander Rhind\nconveyed the said respective parcels of land whereof the said Alexander and George Rhind respectively died seized to the said defendant William Rhind, his heirs and assigns in fee simple. At the date of this deed, namely, the 28th of June, 1890, William Rhind, the grantee therein, was not yet twenty years of age. He undertook, however, the working of the farm and the maintenance of his mother thereon, and became seized of the lands conveyed by the deed, subject, however, to the trust imposed by the deed for the payment and discharge of the debts of his deceased father and brother respectively, and to the right of dowser of his mother in that portion of the land of which his father Alexander had died seized. On the loth October, 1891, William gave to his sister Caroline his promissory note for $225, payable on demand, with interest at 5 per cent per annum by way of security to her for the $225 already mentioned as having been advanced by her in the lifetime of George. Between that date and the month of January, 1896, the defendant Caroline advanced to her brother William the further sums of $65, $40 and $120, to be applied in payment of debts of her brother George for which respectively William gave her his promissory notes dated respectively June 1st, 1893, May 1st, 1895, and January 10th, 1896, with interest on said respective sums at 5 per cent. This latter sum of $120 was advanced in compliance with a request in a letter from William to her dated December 9th, 1895, that she would advance the further sum of $200 to pay debts of George's, still unpaid. In this letter he pledged himself to give her ample security for all her past advances as well as for that then asked for. In her reply dated December 17th, she declares her inability to advance in addition to the sums already advanced by her so large a sum, but promises to send as much as she could, and in January, 1896, she sent the $120. In her letter of December, 1895, and in one of January, 1896, enclosing the money then sent, she insists upon the necessity of her being given some better security for her advances than notes of hand, and adds that of course she would give them up when he should give her security, promised in his letter of December 9th, and that before doing anything more she was very anxious to know how matters stood. In reply to the defendant, William Rhind mailed to her a deed in fee simple dated the 11th day of February, 1896, and duly registered on the same day in the proper registry office in that behalf whereby in consideration of the sum of $750 therein expressed to have been paid to him by Caroline, he conveyed to her all the lands and tenements so as aforesaid conveyed to him by the deed of the 28th June, 1890. The effect and operation of this deed of the 11th February, 1896, was to vest in Caroline all the estate of her brother William in the said lands as security to her for repayment of her said advances with interest as aforesaid, and subject to whatever right the creditors of Alexander and George respectively might have to enforce their claims upon the lands so conveyed to Caroline as equitable charges imposed by the deed of the 28th June, 1890, ratably with Caroline herself in so far as her said advances were applied in payment and discharge of claims against the estate of Alexander and George respectively. Now the plaintiff who claimed to be himself a creditor of both Alexander and George respectively, and as such to have a charge upon the lands so conveyed to William Rhind by the deed of June 28th, 1890, instead of asserting his claim for an equitable charge on the said lands procured the defendant William by threats of criminal prosecution, as stated in the pleadings, to get a reconveyance from Caroline, and then took from William a conveyance to himself by way of mortgage.\nThe plaintiff's case is thus stated in his statement of claim. It alleges first the execution of a mortgage dated the 26th February, 1896, upon the lands in question to secure the payment of $718. It then alleges that $315.28 of that amount was a private debt of William Rhind to the plaintiff. It then alleges the execution of the deed by William to Caroline Rhind dated 11th February, 1896, and avers\nthat the said deed was executed for the purpose and with the intent to hinder and delay the creditors of the said William Rhind, and to prevent the creditors from obtaining payment of the debts due to them and there was no consideration for the making of the said deed.\nThen it alleges that by deed of the 28th June, 1890, the property was by all of the heirs of Alexander and George respectively other than the defendant William, conveyed to William upon the consideration, as already set out above. It then alleges\nthat the defendant William agreed to procure from the defendant Caroline a reconveyance to himself of said property, and to give the plaintiff a mortgage thereon for the sum of $718, if the plaintiff would pay off the debts then remaining due and owing by the said George Rhind, deceased, to which the plaintiff agreed; the defendant William Rhind thereupon procured the said reconveyance and the plaintiff paid off said debts amounting in all to the sum of $472.38, and delivered up to the said defendant William Rhind notes made by the late George Rhind to various parties, which were still due and unpaid, and on which the said sum of $47238\/100% was owing.\nThis sum together with the sum of $315.28 previously mentioned, made the total indebtedness of William Rhind to plaintiff $787.66 from which plaintiff agreed to deduct $69.66, leaving the sum of $718 for which said defendant then gave the said mortgage. It then alleges that at the time the said defendant delivered the said mortgage to the plaintiff he also delivered to him the said deed from the said Caroline to the said William for the purpose of having the same recorded; that the said deed was executed by the said Caroline, but that the registrar declined to register it owing to some alleged defect in the certificate of the notary as to the execution thereof; that the deed was thereupon returned for correction to the said Caroline, who at the instance of and connivance with the defendant William in order to defraud the plaintiff and prevent the said mortgage from binding the property therein described failed, neglected and refused to return said deed for registry, but either retained the same or delivered it to the defendant William who fraudulently retains the same, and the plaintiff prayed 1st. To set aside the deed from William to Caroline Rhind.\n2nd. For a declaration that the mortgage is a lien upon the lands therein described.\n3rd. For an injunction to restrain the defendant Caroline from transferring or conveying the said land to any person other than to the said William Rhind, or in the alternative that the plaintiff recover the said deed from the defendants.\nWe have already seen that there is no foundation for the present claim in so far as it is rested upon the allegation that the deed of the 11th of February, 1896, was executed without any consideration therefor and with a fraudulent intent, and as to the mortgage of the 26th February, 1896, it seems to have been executed upon a consideration similar to that upon which the deed to Caroline of the 11th February, 1896, was executed, namely to secure payment of sums which the plaintiff claimed to be charged upon the lands conveyed by the deed of 28th June, 1890. Of the $315.28 which the plaintiff in his statement of claim alleges to have been a private debt due to him by William Rhind, it appears upon the plaintiff's own evidence given in the action that $273, or thereabouts were monies due to him by Alexander and George respectively, and were as the plaintiff claims charged upon the lands conveyed by the deed of June, 1890.\nWilliam Rhind in his evidence at the trial said that on the evening of the execution of the deed of the 11th February, the plaintiff having heard of it and taking with him one Henry Cruikshanks, a brother in-law of William Rhind, went to see the latter and charged him with having committed a fraudulent and criminal act in executing the deed to his sister for which he was liable to prosecution\u2014that it was a penitentiary case, and he threatened to institute proceedings against him therefor unless he should write at once to his sister and explain to her the position in which he was, as stated to him by the plaintiff and Cruikshanks, and get her to deed back the property to him.\nAfter a long discussion wherein the plaintiff and Cruikshanks persuaded the defendant William that he had committed a criminal offence, they parted on the understanding that William should write to his sister and inform her of the position in which he was as stated to him by the plaintiff and Cruikshanks, and get her to reconvey the property to him as required by the plaintiff. William accordingly wrote to his sister, and told her what had taken place at the interview, and of the threats made by the plaintiff, and in consequence thereof he entreated her in piteous terms to reconvey the property to him\u2014thus\u2014\nBurris says I have got myself into a bad fix. He says that I could not lawfully deed my property to you on any consideration being that you was my sister\u2014a near relation, and furthermore he says that the deed that James Cruikshanks wrote (the deed of 28th June, 1890) holds me for my brother's debts. He says it is a bad thing for me. He said it was a fraud. It would put me into the penitentiary. Henry Cruikshanks said it was a bad thing for me, that my lawyer had advised me wrong; that they wanted a job and are deceiving me just to get me into law. Burris says the same. He says you better deed the property back to me at once or he will take it into law. Burris says he will have George's debts out of the place if it costs him all he is worth. I don't know what to do, as I do not understand law, and Burris says I have done wrong. I did not intend to do wrong. I felt it right that you should have security lor your money which you have loaned me from time to time. But if as Burris and Cruikshanks say the deed holds me for my brother's debts what can I do? I think you had better deed the property back to me as soon as possible to save further trouble. For they will make trouble for me if they can. If it was not for mother I would let them see what they could do, but mother cries and worries so much, thinks I better have it in my name again so as to save further expense. Donald Archibald will send a deed up to you to sign. Return the deed to me after you sign it. I will try in some other way to secure you for the money I have got from you. Try and get this done as soon as possible.\nIn due course Archibald sent to Caroline a deed prepared under instructions of plaintiff which she returned to her brother William. She says that she received the above letter from her brother, and on the same day a letter from Mr. Archibald enclosing a deed for her to sign. After reading her brother's letter she instantly without consulting any one signed the deed. It was her brother William's letter which induced her so quickly to sign the deed. She says:\nAfter I read William's letter I was greatly alarmed and frightened and thought he would be shut, up and be behind the bars, and the sooner I attended to it the better. I was nervous for my mother's sake, and being so far from home I thought he had got into trouble.\nUpon the return of the deed to William, the plaintiff, who was postmaster at the place where William resided, obtained thereby notice of its arrival. The plaintiff says that he saw in the post-office a large envelope addressed to William which he supposed contained the deed, and he would not say that he did not get Henry and James Cruikshanks to go and see William and ascertain whether the deed had not came from his sister. He did not, he said, remember. Henry Cruikshanks was the one who was with the plaintiff in his first interview with William a week previously, and James was a lawyer in the Province of Quebec, and who had drawn the deed of the 28th June, 1890 These two did go up to see William the evening of the day after he had received the deed, and this is his account of what took place. Henry and James Cruikshanks he said, came to his house the night after he got the deed, about eight o'clock, and asked him if he had got the deed, to which he replied that he had, and thereupon James asked to see it. William put the letter containing the deed on the table, and James took it up and read it and said, \"Yes, it is the deed,\" and he put it in his pocket, and said to William that he must come right up with him to the plaintiff. He said that the plaintiff was in a rage and was determined to have the deed, and he added that it was a bad thing, and that he knew a case just like it in Montreal where a young man and his sister had done the same thing, that they thought they had done nothing wrong, but they had been put in the penitentiary. William then said that being ignorant of law he got alarmed, he was frightened about the penitentiary, and being urged by James to go with him up to the plaintiff's, he went. James took the deed with him, and on arriving at the plaintiff's told him that he had it, and James in the plaintiff's presence repeated the story about the young man and his sister at Montreal. Then the plaintiff suggested the execution of a mortgage to himself, he to pay the debts of George upon the estate, and the plaintiff prepared the mortgage which he then procured William to sign.\nIt appears that the deed sent by Caroline to William was not executed, or not proved to have been executed in the manner required by the law of Nova Scotia as regards deeds conveying lands therein executed abroad, and it was sent back to Caroline to Boston through Mr. Archibald, who had originally sent the deed to her with a request to have the defect removed. She, however, heard in the meantime of the execution by her brother of the mortgage to the plaintiff. This she considered to be in violation of the terms upon which she had signed the deed back to her brother, and she then took advice, and in accordance with such advice burned the deed. Now the evidence as already observed clearly shows that there is no ground whatever for the charge which is repeated in the plaintiff's statement of claim as the foundation stone upon which he rests the main prayer for relief, viz., \"To \"set aside the deed from William Rhind to Caroline E. \"Rhind,\" and Caroline in her counter-claim, claims to have the deed executed by her 1o William set aside, and that it may be declared that the deed of the 11th day of February, 1896, is a security to her to secure payment of $450 advanced by her with interest, and that it is a first lien upon the lauds described therein.\nThe learned trial judge has found as matters of fact, that the deed of the 11th February, 1896, was executed to Caroline for good and valuable consideration, and that her brother William requested her to reconvey the property to him from fear of criminal consequences, which fears were the result of plaintiff's and Henry Cruikshanks's conversations when he was threatened with proceedings by the plaintiff, and that William under such impressions wrote for the deed and informed his sister as he believed that he had made himself criminally responsible, and that the defendant Caroline acting on the information so conveyed to her by William, and in the belief that her brother had made himself criminally liable, executed a deed reconveying the property to William.\nNow it is not questioned that, and I think there can be no doubt that if the deed which was executed by Caroline to her brother had been executed by a father for the relief of a son from a criminal prosecution under the circumstances appearing in evidence here, it could not have been maintained at the suit of and in the interest of the plaintiff, but the learned trial judge was of opinion that the rule applicable to a father entering into a contract for the purpose of relieving a son from a criminal prosecution does not apply in the case of a sister doing the like for a brother. He could, he said, find no such case in the English reports although there are several in the American courts in which the same principle is applied in both cases.\nThe principle as gathered from the judgment of Lord Westbury in Williams v. Bayley[5] is that\na contract to give security for the debt of another, which is a contract without consideration, is above all things, a contract that should be based upon the free and voluntary agency of the individual who enters into it. But it is clear that the power of considering whether he ought to do it or not, whether it is prudent to do it or not, is altogether taken away from a father who is brought into the situation of either refusing, and leaving the son in that perilous condition, or of taking on himself the amount of the civil obligation.\nThe case before us presents an illustration, if any were needed, of the fact that the sympathies and affections of a sister for a brother equally as those of a father for a son are susceptible of being called into action so as to deprive her of the power of considering whether she ought to have executed the deed as required by the plaintiff\u2014whether it would be prudent for her so to do and in short to deprive her of the power of acting with that freedom and power of deliberation which her own interests and the nature of the case required. That her interests were subordinated to her sympathies and affection for her brother in the peril to which she believed him to be exposed there can be no doubt, and I can therefore see no reason why the principle as laid down in Williams v. Bayley (1) should not apply to her case.\nSeear v. Cohen[6] is an authority that in the case of a contract entered into like the present upon threats of criminal prosecution it is not necessary that actual ground for the prosecution should exist in fact. We now see that in the present case none did in point of fact exist. The deed of the 11th February, 1896, is established to have been executed for good and valuable consideration. The plaintiff in his statement of claim bases his claim for the relief upon an allegation that it was executed with a fraudulent intent and without consideration. If he could have succeeded in establishing that contention William Rhind might have been exposed to criminal prosecution under sec. 363 of the Criminal Code upon the contention that under the deed of the 28th June, 1890, William Rhind became a trustee of the land in favour of the creditors of his father Alexander and his brother George, and this no doubt was the criminal prosecution referred to. But as already said the question is not whether there was any good ground for a criminal prosecution but whether the plaintiff having charged William Rhind with a criminal offence in his executing to his sister Caroline the deed of the 11th February, 1896, and having threatened to prosecute him therefor and having procured him, as I think we must upon the evidence hold that the plaintiff did procure him, to write to his sister and to persuade her that in executing to her that deed he had committed a criminal offence and had subjected himself to a criminal prosecution therefor which the plaintiff threatened to institute against him unless Caroline should reconvey the land to her brother, and she having without any consideration whatever other than of releasing her brother from such threatened prosecution executed in favour of her brother a reconveyance of the land which she afterwards destroyed as appearing in evidence, and the plaintiff having got possession of that deed before it was destroyed under the circumstances stated by William Rhind, can he now, having failed to establish any fraud whatever in the execution of the deed of 11th February, 1896, which is shewn to have been executed for good and valuable consideration, establish any equity to claim the benefit of the deed of reconveyance from Caroline to William Rhind so as aforesaid executed and afterwards destroyed as still being a good, valid and subsisting deed in support of the mortgage executed by William Rhind on the 26th February, 1896, under the circumstances appearing in his evidence? I think that he cannot, but that on the contrary the counter claim of the defendant Caroline must prevail, and that this appeal must be dismissed with costs, and that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, with a slight variation therein, must be maintained, such variation consisting in adding to the last paragraph but one of that judgment after the words \"$450 advanced by defendant Carolina Rhind to the defendant William Rhind\" the following \"subject however to any claim which the plaintiff may be able to establish ratably with her the said Caroline, as a charge upon the said lands under the terms of the deed of the 25th June, 1890, as a creditor of the late Alexander or George Rhind respectively, or for monies actually paid by the plaintiff to persons who as creditors of said Alexander or George Rhind had claims upon the said lands by virtue of the said deed for debts due to such creditors by said Alexander and George Rhind respectively, and also subject ratably to the claims of any other creditors if any there be of the said Alexander or George Rhind having charges on the lands under the said deed of the 28th June, 1890.\"\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for reasons given in a judgment prepared by the Chief Justice.

B. A. Ritchie Q.C. and McLean for the appellants. In cases where false misrepresentation is made by a party to an agreement, the power of equity is extensive, and the contract itself may be set aside, or the person who made the assertion compelled to make it good. Burrowes v. Locke[2], at page 474; Williams v. Williams[3], at page 857; Berry v. Peek:[4], at page 360; Mills v. Fox[5], at pages 162-166; Hammersley v. De Biel[6], at pages 87-88; Hutlon v. Rossiter[7], at page 18. Upon the authorities above referred to, the plaintiff is estopped from laying claim to any portion of the land in dispute, and from denying that the title thereto is vested in the defendant under the conveyance in question. Moreover, the court below dealt with the case as if all necessary amendments had been made. No amendments were necessary in this respect. Sanderson v. Collman[8]; Freeman v. Cooke[9]. The defendant Edward Zwicker relies on the ground that he is entitled to ratification of the conveyance from plaintiff to himself as claimed in the counter-claim. The findings of fact with respect to the terms of the contract have not been materially varied by the finding of the court on appeal. The majority of that court refused relief to the plaintiff on the ground that the secret fraudulent intention in the plaintiff's own mind enables him to repudiate his representation to the plaintiff, and to say that there was no mutual or common mistake. The plaintiff cannot take this position. He is estopped from denying the truth of his representation to the defendant. If he believed that representation to be true there was a common mistake. If he did not believe that representation to be true he was guilty of fraudulent conduct, and the court will not draw fine distinctions for the purpose of enabling him to benefit by that fraud. \"No man can be heard to say that he is to be assumed not to have spoken the truth.\" Knight Bruce, L.J. in Price v. Macaulay[10], at page 346. As to the cases in which rectification will be granted upon oral evidence, see Clarke v. Joselin[11]; Story, Equity Jurisprudence, sec. 153. Buller & Leake, Pleading, p. 693 note.\nThe court below have unduly extended the doctrine that reformation cannot be obtained unless a common mistake is clearly established. A secret fraudulent intention in the mind of the plaintiff cannot be invoked for the purpose of claiming on his behalf that there was not a mistake on his part. He is bound by his acts and declarations, even when these are inconsistent with his secret fraudulent intention. See Kerr, on Fraud and Mistake, p. 498. The language of the text writer is qualified by the expression \"without fraud,\" the clear inference being that in a case where fraud existed the rule would be otherwise. In Garrard v. Frankel[12], Sir John Romilly M.R. at page 451 said, \"the court will, I apprehend, interfere in cases of mistake where one party to the transaction, being at the time cognizant of the fact of the error, seeks to take advantage of it.\"\nAll the facts upon which the appellants mainly rely are supported by the finding of the judge of first instance as well as by the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Before that finding will be disturbed it must be shown with absolute clearness that it was wrong. Allen v. Quebec Warehouse Co.[13]; Schwerenski v. Vineberg[14]; George Matthews Co. v. Bouchard[15], at page 588 per Girouard J.\nThe defendant Edward Zwicker is entitled to specific performance of the plaintiff's agreements to sell to him the land in dispute up to the Grinton line, on the authorities already cited, and also on Olley v. Fisher[16]. Newcombe Q.C. and F. B. Wade Q.C. for the respondent. The disputed strip has remained in the possession of respondent, showing the interpretation placed upon their contract by the parties themselves, and that there was no mutual mistake, and there has been no fraud pleaded or established by the evidence. The parties went upon the ground, measured it, and established the bounds; and the deed, which was drawn under their joint direction, comprised exactly what land was agreed, and what both parties understood, to be sold and purchased. Where the party purchasing knows exactly the limits of the land he is buying, and accepts a deed correctly describing it, he can never reform that deed, because there has been no mistake upon his part. How much greater the difficulty when the seller also claim she made no mistake. The plaintiff intended to sell only the land up to the pine tree, and the defendant thought that he was purchasing only up to that tree. If the Grinton line was to be the boundary, why did the defendant allow instructions to be given in his presence to insert in the deed the pine tree as the bound; why did he accept and record that deed; why was the pine tree blazed; why did the defendant mark the tree with his initials; why did he claim the land along the road to that tree, and why were the number of rods inserted in the deed. It would have been much simpler to have inserted the Grinton line as the boundary than to locate a fixed bound as was done.\nAs to rectification, see Irnham v. Child[17], Pollock on Contracts, (5 ed.) p. 495; Taylor on Evidence (9 ed.), sec. 1139; Wright v. Goff[18]; Cowen v. Truefitt[19], at p. 554; Llewellyn v. Earl of Jersey[20]; Penrose v. Knight[21]; Duke of Sutherland v. Heathcote[22], at p. 486.\nThe deed cannot be rectified except for mistake, which must be mutual and established by the clearest and most satisfactory evidence Bradford v. Romney[23], at page 438; Garrard v. Frankel[24], at page 457; Bloomer v. Spittle[25]; Paget v. Marshall[26]; Fry on Specific Performance (3 ed.), p. 367; Fowler v. Fowler[27]; Dominion Loan Society v. Darling[28]; Sylvester v. Porter[29], at page 106 et seq. A deed cannot be rectified, but only set aside on account of fraud. Walt v. Grove[30]; Rawlins v. Wickham[31], at pages 320, 321; McNeill x. Haines[32], at pages 481, 484 and 485.\nThe court cannot take notice of fraud unless it be pleaded. Hardman v. Putnam[33]; Wallingford v. Mutual Society[34], at pages 701 and 709; Lawrance v. Norreys[35]; Redgrave v. Hurd[36], at page 12; R. S. N. S. (5 Ser.), pages 849 to 851, rules 4, 6 and 15.\nEstoppel has not been pleaded.

Bigelow on Estoppel (5 ed), p. 490; Preble v. Conger[37].\nThere being no pleading by way of reply, issue was joined on the defence to the counterclaim by virtue of the statute. R. S N. S. (5 Ser.) p. 867, rule 12.\nThere was no necessity to appeal from the trial judge's direction to amend as the appeal from the judgment on the merits raises the question as to the propriety of the amendment. And in any case the judge did not make any finding or amendment to cover estoppel as that question was not raised at the trial. Laird v. Briggs[38].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This appeal relates only to a portion of the causes of action in the statement of claim mentioned, namely trespasses alleged to have been committed by the defendants upon a strip of land in the second paragraph of the statement of claim alleged to be the property of the plaintiff, which piece of land is there described as situate in or near New Germany, upon the main post road, and bounded on the northeast by the Bridgewater Road so called; on the southeast by property of the defendants; on the south-west by the LaHave River; and on the north-west by property of the defendants. The defendants in their statement of defence, besides denying that this piece of land is the property of the plaintiff, counterclaimed to the effect following: that the plaintiff agreed to sell to the defendant Zwicker all his, the plaintiff's, right, title and interest in a piece of land situate in New Germany, on the eastern side of the LaHave River, and on the western side of the road leading to Annapolis, and bounded as follows:\nBeginning three rods from the line of John Chesley and running westerly parallel to said line until it strikes the LaHave River; thence up the said LaHave River by its several courses until it strikes the property of one Alexander Grinton; thence north-east wardly until it strikes the main road thence eastwardly along such road to the place of beginning.\nThis description includes the piece of land under consideration in this appeal. The counterclaim, in short substance, proceeds to allege that the plaintiff executed to the defendant Edward Zwicker a deed by which it was intended to convey the whole of the plaintiff's interest in the said piece of land to the defendant Edward Zwicker, and upon the execution of the deed the defendant Edward Zwicker in virtue thereof entered into possession and still is in possession of the whole of the land as above described up to the Grinton line, but the description inserted in the said deed was erroneous by reason of the plaintiff having represented that a pine tree mentioned in such description was on the western extremity of his, the plaintiff's, land, and on the boundary between the land of the plaintiff and that of Alexander Grrinton. The description so inserted is as follows:\nBeginning three rods from the line of John Chesley and running west wardly parallel to said line until it strikes the LaHave River; thence up stream by the several courses of said river seventy-four rods to a pine tree marked \"Bound\" nearly opposite the pound; thence northeasterly until it strikes the main road aforesaid; thence easterly down along said road to the place of beginning.\nThat such description does not correctly state the true boundaries of the whole of the land purchased by said defendant from the plaintiff, but leaves a strip which is part of the land bought by said defendant from the plaintiff, and which is the portion of land described in the second paragraph of the statement of claim, and the use of which as part of the land purchased by said defendant, is the trespass of which the plaintiff complains. The counterclaim concludes with a prayer for a decree for the reformation of the deed from the plaintiff to the said defendant so as to include all the land bought and paid for by said defendant up to the Grinton line as described in paragraph one of the counter claim or a decree for specific performance of the sale of the land as described in said paragraph one of the counterclaim, and such further relief as the nature of the case may require.\nIt appeared in evidence that the defendant Edward Zwicker at the time of his agreement of purchase from the plaintiff being entered into contemplated acquiring a further piece from Grinton for piling grounds and with that in view it was a matter of importance to the defendant that his purchase from the plaintiff should extend to the Grinton line; and the learned trial judge has found as matter of fact\nthat the agreement was to purchase up to the Grinton line, that while the pine tree was marked and intentionally inserted in the deed it was done upon the representation of the plaintiff that the pine tree fairly indicated the locality of the boundary line between the plaintiff and Grinton, and that this representation was false in fact as the plaintiff well knew.\nThe plaintiff had in his evidence stated that he thought the line between him and Grinton to be six rods from the pine tree, but that he did not consider he was under any obligation to tell Zwicker where the true boundary was. The learned trial judge accordingly gave judgment on the counterclaim for reformation of the deed by the insertion therein of the true boundary up to the Grinton line according to the original agreement of purchase and sale. Upon appeal by the plaintiff the majority of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Henry J. dissenting, have reversed that judgment. Ritchie J. pronouncing the judgment of the majority says:\nAfter a careful consideration of the evidence I have come to the conclusion that the defendant Zwicker at the time he made the agreement to purchase the lot, and when he got the deed intended to purchase up to the Grinton line and believed that the deed he received conveyed to him the whole lot and that such belief was caused wholly by the misrepresentations of the plaintiff who induced him to complete the purchase under that idea, but I am unable to find that it was the intention of the plaintiff to convey the whole lot. The evidence as I view it points pretty conclusively to the fact that the plaintiff by taking the pine tree as marking the Grinton line which he knew at the time was untrue, and representing that to defendant, intended to defraud him and to retain for his own use a portion of the lot next the Grinton line, and at the same time to induce the defendant to purchase what he supposed was the whole lot, leaving no interval between it and the Grinton lot, which lot the defendant Edward Zwicker, as the plaintiff well knew, then contemplated purchasing and afterwards acquired. There is no allegation of fraud in the counter claim which proceeds on the ground of mutual mistake only. To rectify the deed in this case as claimed by defendant would not in my opinion carry out the real intentions of both parties as I think the plaintiff at the time he gave the deed did not intend to sell the portion above the pine tree although he had defrauded the defendant and had led him to believe that the deed covered the whole lot.\nAnd he concludes saying\nno doubt the defendant Edward Zwicker has a remedy against plaintiff for the fraud, but not I think in the form asserted in his counterclaim.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia were thus of opinion that the defendant Edward Zwicker was chiefly entitled to some measure of relief against the fraud practiced upon him by the plaintiff, but not by rectification of the deed upon the ground of mutual mistake. But by the statute law of Nova Scotia, 5th series, ch. 104, it is enacted that at any time during the progress of an action the necessary amendments shall be made for the purpose of determining the real question or issue raised by or depending on the proceedings, and further that the court and every judge thereof shall recognise and take notice of all equitable estates, titles and rights, duties and liabilities appearing incidentally in the course of any cause or matter, and by the Supreme Court Act of 1880, 43 Vict. ch. 34, (R. S. C. c. 135, ss. 63-65.) this relief may and should be granted by this court in appeal if it should have been omitted to be granted in the courts below. Now the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia were of opinion that the error made in the description of the piece of land which Zwicker was intending to purchase and for which he had agreed to pay $650, was made by the plaintiff's procurement designedly false with intent to defraud the purchaser and to induce him to accept the deed containing an incorrect description as containing a true description of the piece of land he was purchasing, and that by such fraudulent means the plaintiff procured Zwicker to complete the purchase and pay the purchase money agreed upon. If there was any necessity for an amendment of the statement of claim by insertion therein of an averment that the plaintiff had fraudulently procured an erroneous description to be inserted in the deed which he induced the defendant Edward Zwicker to accept upon the faith and assurance that the description was correct such amendment could readily have been made by force of the Nova Scotia statute, and accordingly should have been made by the mere insertion of the words \"falsely and fraudulently\" after the words \"owing to the plaintiff,\" and before the words \"representing that\" in the second line of the sixth paragraph of the counterclaim in the printed case, and such amendment if necessary can by force of the Dominion Statute 43 Vict. ch. 34 be still made so as to make the allegation in the pleadings accord with the facts as proved and found in the courts below and dealing with the facts as so found, I think it is clear that the defendant Edward Zwicker has established his right to the benefit of the well established principle of equity that where a person makes a false representation for the purpose of fraudulently influencing the conduct of another person who acts upon the representation, the person making the representation is estopped from denying the truth of the representation and may be compelled by the court to give effect to it upon the authority of Jorden v.\n[Page 526\nMoney[39]; Citizens Bank of Louisiana v. First National Bank of New Orleans[40]; Hammersley v. DeBiel[41], and many other cases to the like effect. I must, however, say that I do not think that the absence of an averment in the counterclaim that the representation of the plaintiff whereby he procured an erroneous description of the piece of land Zwicker was purchasing to be inserted in the deed was designedly false and fraudulent prejudiced in any respect the purchaser's right to relief upon the ground of estoppel because of the representation proving in point of fact to have been false and fraudulent. The appeal must therefore be allowed with costs, and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored with a declaration added thereto that the plaintiff is estopped from claiming as his own the piece of land in the pleadings mentioned which lies between the line at the pine tree and the Grinton line, and by the insertion of a clause rendering judgment for the defendants in the plaintiff's action as to so much thereof as relates to a claim against the defendants for trespass on such piece of land.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: A.

B. A. Ritchie Q.C. and McLean for the appellants. Undue importance has been attached to the fact that the deed was apparently retained in the possession of the grantor during his lifetime. It seems clear that Joseph Zwicker intended to make the deed operative in every respect. The evidence of the defendant Ezra Zwicker shews that Benjamin Zwicker, the subscribing witness, was present when the deed was given to him. The fact that the deed was taken back and retained does not necessarily render the deed inoperative. The whole transaction amounted to a family settlement or arrangement respecting the property of the intestate, an arrangement made for the purpose of convenience and in order to avoid expense. The plaintiff throughout assented to that arrangement both in the testator's lifetime and afterwards. He should not now be permitted, by taking out administration in respect of an estate in which he and the defendants are solely interested, to interfere with an arrangement so made and acquiesced in by himself. We rely upon Clinch v. Pernette[2], and cases there cited; Xenos v. Wickham[3]; Clavering v. Clavering[4]; Roberts v. Security Co.[5]; McDonald v. McMaster[6].\nEven if the evidence were insufficient to establish a delivery by Joseph Zwicker in his lifetime the acts of the plaintiff in assenting to the deed as a binding instrument, causing it to be recorded, paying his share of the cost thereof, and in taking possession and claiming under it the property of Joseph Zwicker, prevent him from setting up any title inconsistent with the conveyance in question. 1 Williams on Executors, (9 ed.) 344, 345; Kenrick v. Burgess[7]; Whitehall v. Squire[8]. The intestate, having executed the deed, would be estopped from denying its delivery and the plaintiff as his administrator is therefore also estopped in the same manner and to the same extent. Wade Q. C. for the respondent. The respondent as administrator is entitled to possession and control of all the personal property, documents and writings owned by Joseph Zwicker at the time of his death. The deed of 1877 was never delivered and was not intended to operate as a deed, but as a testamentary writing. It is inoperative as a will by reason of insufficient attestation. It is a question of fact whether the deed was or was not delivered and the findings of the trial judge unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on appeal should not be disturbed.\nThe appellants, in their ignorance of the law as to delivery, evidently considered as soon as the deed was discovered that it gave them all the personal property Joseph Zwicker owned at the date of the deed. Their conduct in giving up some of the property and only claiming the property they considered their father owned at the date of the deed is consistent with that theory, and not consistent with the theory that the appellants understood the agreement to record the deed to mean an agreement to share the property as set out in the deed, for in the latter case the appellants would have got all the personal property and would not have given up any of it.\nThe respondent as administrator is not bound by his acts before he was appointed administrator, for those acts were not beneficial to the estate. Doe d. Hornby v. Glenn[9]; Matters v. Brown[10]; Morgan v. Thomas[11] per Parke B, at page 307.\nIn any case the respondent was entitled to succeed in his action to recover the release signed by the grandsons, without which the estate could not be settled up in the Probate Court, and, in any case, to the accounting, for it appeared the appellants were holding some property acquired by Joseph Zwicker since the date of the deed and also some property belonging to the estate, not included in the inventory. Coote v. Whittington[12].\nAll the circumstances of the case rebut any presumption as to delivery of the deed. See Doe d. Garnons v. Knight[13] at pages 684 and 694 where cases are discussed; Murray v. Earl of Stair[14]; National Provincial Bank v. Jackson[15]. There is no plea as to estoppel by the registration of the deed; Odgers on Pleading; McDonald v. Blois[16]; Morgan v, Thomas[17].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in an action brought by the respondent as administrator of his father, Joseph Zwicker, seeking the delivery up of certain specific chattels, of a deed dated the 5th of April, 1877, described in the statement of claim as being from the intestate Joseph Zwicker to Eri, Ezra and Edward Zwicker, and of a document dated the 2nd October, 1884, described in the statement of claim as being from Eri, Ezra and Edward Zwicker to Reuben Ernst, Edward Ernst and Eliah Ernst, and generally the delivery up of all personal property and documents belonging to the estate of Joseph Zwicker. The appellants who were the defendants in the action deny that the documents and personal property specifically claimed by the respondent belonged to the estate of the intestate, and also deny that they have in their possession any property belonging to the respondent as administrator. At the trial before a judge without a jury, the facts appeared to be that the deed of the 5th of April, 1877, was an indenture made between Joseph Zwicker, the intestate, of the one part, and his three sons the respondent and the appellants of the other part, whereby the grantor purported to convey certain lands to his sons in fee. It also contained a disposition of chattel property in the following words:\nI also give unto my two sons, Ezra and Edward, all my stock of cattle, household furniture, farming implements, all personal property hut the notes of hand and mortgages, and the house shall he jointly owned by my three sons.\nThe defendant in his deposition says that Benjamin Zwicker, the witness to the deed, was present when it was given to him. There was no dispute as to the signatures of the subscribing witness and the grantor being genuine, but the death of the subscribing witness, Benjamin Zwicker, was not proved, nor was his signature proved. This, it is explained in an affidavit of Mr. McLean, the appellant's solicitor, filed on the appeal and motion for a new trial, was in consequence of his mistake as to the extent of the admission made between the solicitors for the purposes of the trial. On the motion there was put in an affidavit of Jacob Pickles, a justice of the peace, who deposes that the execution of the deed was sworn to before him by Benjamin Zwicker, the subscribing witness, on or about the 17th of April, 1877. The same deponent also proves the death of Benjamin Zwicker and his handwriting and signature to the deed. This affidavit, which was rejected by the court below, ought in my opinion to have been received, and it sufficiently establishes the execution of the deed so far as regards the signing and sealing of the instrument.\nIt is however urged, and the court below have given effect to the objection, that there is no proof of the delivery of the deed. It is assumed, and it is I think the proper conclusion from the evidence, that the deed was retained in the possession of the grantor until his death, and this fact has been considered sufficient to show that the deed never was so delivered as to take effect as a duly executed instrument. It is in the face of decided cases of the highest authority out of the question to say that a deed must be presumed to have been inoperative for want of delivery merely because the grantor has retained it in his possession for many years and up to the time of his death. The following cases may be selected from a greater number as controverting any such proposition: Doe d. Garnons v. Knight[18]; Exton v. Scott[19]; Fletcher v. Fletcher[20]; Xenos v. Wickham[21]; Hall v. Palmer[22]; Moore v. Hazelton[23].\nIn all these cases it was held that the retention of the deed after its signing and sealing by the grantor did not show that the execution was defective for want of delivery even in the case where the fact of its existence had never up to the grantor's death been communicated to the parties claiming under it. In Fletcher v. Fletcher (3), Wigram V.C. says:\nThe case of Doe v. Knight (1) shows that if an instrument is sealed and delivered the retainer of it by the party in his possession does not prevent it from taking effect. No doubt the intention of the parties is often disappointed by holding them to be bound by deeds which they have kept back but such is unquestionably the law.\nIn Xenos v. Wickham (4) Mr. Justice Blackburn in delivering his opinion to the House of Lords thus states the law:\nNo particular technical form of words or acts is necessary to render an instrument the deed of the party sealing it. * * It is clear on the authorities as well as on the reason of the thing that the deed is binding on the obligor before it comes into the custody of the obligee, nay before he even knows of it.\nIn the same case Lord Cranworth says:\nIn the first place the efficacy of a deed depends on it being sealed and delivered by the maker of it, not on his ceasing to retain possession of it. This as a general proposition of law cannot be controverted.\nIn Moore v. Hazelton[24] the court says:\nExecution of the deed in the presence of an attesting witness is sufficient evidence from which to infer a delivery.\nAlthough these authorities are not referred to in the judgment under appeal I assume they were cited in the court below, and that their decision holding the deed inoperative proceeded on the ground that the facts in evidence rebutted the presumption in favour of the due execution of the instrument. These facts are said to consist not only in the retention of the deed by the grantor, but also in the fact that it comprised all the property which he possessed, and that it professed to dispose of this property immediately and that inconsistently with its tenor the grantor retained the possession and enjoyment of his property until his death. No case is referred to as warranting the proposition that this is sufficient to control the effect of the deed, and in the absence of authority I see nothing to authorise it. The circumstance of non-communication to those taking benefits under the deed (if we are to assume such to have been the fact), is shown by the cases referred to to be immaterial, and it may well be that the intestate thought fit to trust to the good feeling and affection of his sons not to disturb him in his enjoyment. At all events we could not disregard a rule of law sanctioned by such high authority and in so many reported decisions without making a precedent which we should be compelled to follow in other cases. When Joseph Zwicker died in 1894 this deed came into the possession of his sons, and they, including the respondent, agreed to act upon it, and did act upon it by placing it upon the county registry of deeds in order to do which they had of course to treat it as a valid and subsisting instrument by proving it in the manner required by the law. The respondent, moreover, contributed his share of the expense of registration.\nFurther, it is out of the question to say that there was no communication of the deed to the sons during the grantor's lifetime. One of the documents sought to be recovered is the bond already mentioned dated the 2nd of October, 1884. By this instrument the three sons became bound to pay certain sums to three grandsons of the intestate named Ernst, sons of two of his daughters, both of whom were dead. These sums were duly paid on the testator's decease. To this bond there is appended a memorandum also under seal of the intestate himself as follows:\nAll the real estate already divided amongst my three sons Eri Zwicker, Ezra Zwicker and Edward Zwicker, to stand and remain as at present provided. The remainder of my real estate to be divided amongst my three aforesaid sons as they shall agree amongst themselves, after my death. My said three sons to divide equally amongst themselves all notes, judgments, mortgages or written obligations to pay money as remain after the death of my wife Barbara Zwicker.\nAll the household furniture, livestock and farming implements to be equally divided between my two sons, Edward Zwicker and Ezra Zwicker after the death of my wife, Barbara Zwicker.\n(Sgd.) JOSEPH ZWICKER (L.S.)\nWitness:\u2014\n(Sgd.) George Wilson.\nThe division referred to in this memorandum must be taken to have reference to the division effected by the deed as no other division is suggested.\nAs the testator lived for some ten years after this and retained the bond which upon his death the sons were compelled to implement (as they did), the arrangement then come to, having the deed for its basis, was a clear recognition of the distribution effected by the deed and to disturb it now would be most inequitable and unjust.\nThe testator's widow died soon after him.\nUpon receiving the several sums mentioned in the bond the three grandsons released and discharged the estate from all claims. It is not shown or even alleged that there are any debts due by the estate. The only persons therefore beneficially interested were the three sons, the appellants and the respondent. Soon after their mother's death, which took place in 1895, they agreed to a distribution of the personal property, and it was accordingly divided. There can be no doubt of this agreement having been come to and having been acted upon. The judgment of Mr. Justice Henry who tried the case without a jury contains the following passage:\nNotwithstanding the transaction by which it clearly seems to me that the plaintiff previous to his becoming administrator of his father's estate, agreed with his two brothers, who were the only persons interested in the estate, to act upon the deed and divide the property in accordance with its terms, I feel bound to hold that the plaintiff in his capacity as administrator is entitled to recover.\nAfter this the respondent took out letters of administration, the expenses of which were paid in equal proportions by the three brothers, and now by this action seeks to repudiate the arrangement to which he was a party for the division of the personal property as well as the deed.\nThe learned judge who tried the case thought he was not bound in his character of administrator by what he had been a party to and had acquiesced in before the administered. Two cases are referred to in his judgment for this proposition; they are, however, easily distinguishable. They were both cases at common law in which it was held that the acts of an administrator before the grant did not affect him. Here, however, all equitable considerations are open, and it is manifest that there are no persons beneficially interested but the three parties to the family arrangement, of whom the respondent was one. Is it then to be said that the respondent is to be at liberty to break up this arrangement in order that he may as administrator get into his hands property which upon the most ordinary principles of equity he might be called on to return the next day in another action instituted to compel him to carry out his agreement. Surely this would be encouraging a circuitry of litigation which we are told it is the policy of courts of justice to prevent.\nI am of opinion that the appeal must be allowed with costs and the action dismissed also with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: A.

Taylor (29 Can. S. C. R. 104), that compliance with this provision was a condition precedent to an action on the policy.\nHeld, also, that a person not an officer of the insurance company, appointed to investigate the loss and report thereon to the company, was not an agent of the latter having authority to waive compliance with such condition, and if he had such authority he could not, after the fifteen days had expired, extend the time without express authority from his principal.\nHeld, further, that compliance with the condition could not in any case be waived unless such waiver was clearly expressed in writing signed by the company's manager in Montreal, as required by another condition in the policy.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe questions to be decided on the appeal are indicated in the above head-note, and the material facts will be found in the judgment of the court delivered by Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nDrysdale Q.C. and Currie Q.C. for the appellant. The scope of an agent's authority is always a question of fact for the jury, and in the face of the evidence the court cannot supply the necessary finding that Jarvis had authority to waive any condition. Even if the jury had found that he had authority, that finding would of necessity be set aside, as the evidence is all the other way. Mason v. Hartford Fire Ins Co.[2]; Acey v. Fernie[3]. The plaintiff or his agent held the policy, and must be presumed to have known the time within which proofs of loss should have been delivered. Accident Ins. Co. v. Young[4]. The furnishing of a blank to assured, or the filling of it up by adjuster or agent for the company, is not to be considered as a waiver of the rights of the company; Caldwetl v. Stadacona Fire and Life Ins. Co.[5]. The evidence does not support the second finding of the jury that Jarvis \"by his acts, words and conduct,\" caused or induced the plaintiff to delay sending proofs of loss. Estoppel is not pleaded nor relied upon, and no evidence was given in support of it. This case is governed by Logan v. Commercial Union Ins. Co.[6]. See also Hiddle v. National Fire and Marine Ins. Co. of New Zealand[7], and Employers' Liability Assurance Corporation v. Taylor[8].\nIt is clear that better particulars could have been given. The plaintiffs could have obtained invoices within a week after the loss; and the business was a new one carried on for only one year before the fire. The burden is upon the respondents to show that they could not furnish complete proofs within the fifteen days as the contract makes this a condition precedent to recovery, and they offer no excuse for delay. Nixon v. Queen Ins. Co.[9]; Hiddle v. National Fire and Marine Ins Co. of New Zealand[10].\nDickie Q.C. and Congdon for the respondents. The defence did not allege that the statutory declaration had not been furnished within fifteen days, but only that the plaintiff delivered to the company as proofs of loss an account and statutory declaration which was fraudulent and contained false statements to the knowledge of the plaintiff, etc. At the close of the case, after both addresses to the jury, counsel for the defendant applied for leave to amend the defence by setting up that the declaration was not furnished within fifteen days at all. Such an amendment should not have been allowed at so late a stage of the proceedings, and there was nothing before the court justifying the allowance thereof; the defendant abandoned the amendment and never put any plea upon the record in pursuance thereof. Even if the request of the counsel can be deemed the plea upon the record, it is demurrable and shews no defence to the action. The condition has not been proved and does not appear upon the record. The policy shews the requirement as to statutory proof to be a mere direction and not a condition.\nAs particular an account of the loss as the nature of the case permitted was delivered by the plaintiff within the meaning of the policy. The term \"full particulars\" must mean the best particulars the assured can reasonably give; and the condition is not to be construed with strictness; Mason v. Harvey[11]; Porter on Insurance, 3 ed. p. 206; May on Insurance, 3 ed. par. 475. The letter and telegram sent at the instance of assured were notice to the company, and contained as particular an account of the loss as the nature of the case permitted: (a) time of fire; (b) that the loss was total; (c) that there was $500 other insurance on store; (d) that the fire was probably of incendiary origin; (e) that stock was worth $3,000 and over; (f) particulars as to state of premises before fire. Books, invoices and drafts were furnished to Jarvis within the fifteen days, and all information the nature of the case then permitted was submitted to him, and he expressed himself as satisfied. Jarvis waived compliance with the direction as to time for putting in the proofs of loss, and the company is estopped by matter in pais from setting up non-compliance; (a) by stating that the proofs of loss should be sent in within thirty days, and by his acts leading plaintiffs to rely on such statement; (b) by appointing a time to meet plaintiffs and prepare proofs of loss which was later than fifteen days after the fire; (c) by post card and by letter. The finding of the jury on this phase of the case cannot be disturbed. Caldwell v. Sladacona Fire and Life Ins. Co.[12], per Ritchie C.J. at pages 224-5.\nThe court below erred in treating this as a waiver, but should have held the defendants estopped by matter in pais from setting up non-compliance with the condition; Western Assurance Co. v. Doull[13]; Searle v. Dwelling House Ins. Co.[14]; Beach on Insurance, sec. 1,240; Jennings v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.[15], per Allen J. at p. 65; Union Mutual Ins. Co. v. Wilkinson[16]. Jarvis was acting within his authority as agent and could by his language and acts waive the condition in question and estop the company from setting it up, and the company was so satisfied to adopt his acts that until the trial was about concluded the issue as to delivery of proofs of loss was not raised, and no other attack made on them except that they were fraudulent and false. See also Stoneham v. Ocean, Railway & General Accident Ins. Co.[17]; Manufacturers Accident Ins. Co. v. Pudsey[18]; Carroll v. Charter Oak Ins. Co[19]; Travellers Ins. Co. v. Edwards[20].\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The plaintiff Ferguson Brownell, a general merchant, carrying on business at Northport, Nova Scotia, had insured his stock in trade to the extent of $2,000, in the appellant company. Fire having occurred the claim was disputed upon several grounds, and the case having been tried before Mr. Justice Townshend and a jury there was judgment for the plaintiffs, which was sustained by the court en banc, Mr. Justice Henry dissenting. The policy was in the usual form with conditions indorsed and made part of the policy. The thirteenth condition was in part as follows:\n(b) He is to deliver within fifteen days after the fire, in writing, as particular an account of the loss as the nature of the case permits.\n(d) He is, in support of his claim, if required, and if practicable, to produce books of account and furnish invoices, plans, specifications and other vouchers; to furnish copies of the written portions of all policies; and to exhibit for examination all that remains of the property which was covered by the policy, which property, if moveable, the insured shall, by separating the damaged from the undamaged and otherwise, assort and arrange in as good order as the circumstances of the case will allow, so as to facilitate the taking of an account and estimating the value of the same.\nAnother condition was:\n6. No condition of the policy, either in whole or in part, shall be deemed to have been waived by the company unless the waiver is clearly expressed in writing, signed by the company's manager in Montreal. It is admitted that the plaintiff did not deliver to the company or its agent within fifteen days after the fire as particular an account of the loss as the nature of the case permitted, as required by the condition above set out; and the main question upon this appeal is as to whether this condition was waived by the company so as to enable the plaintiff to recover.\nThe plaintiffs rely upon the acts and statements of one Charles E. L. Jarvis, who after the fire was sent by the company to report on the fire and the amount of the loss, as sufficient proof of waiver on the part of the company. And the question was put by the learned trial judge to the jury:\nDid Charles E. Jarvis by his acts, words or conduct, cause or induce the plaintiff to delay in sending to the company or its agent the necessary proofs of loss within the fifteen days expressed in the condition?\nand the jury answered \"Yes.\"\nThere was no finding of the jury that Jarvis had any authority from the company so to bind it, but inasmuch as the trial judge entered judgment for the plaintiff although at the same time expressing very grave doubts as to whether Jarvis occupied such a position towards the company as to make his conduct and statements binding upon it by estoppel, it must be assumed for the purpose of this appeal that the learned judge found that he had such authority. The authority of Mr. Jarvis and his relation to the defendant company will appear from the evidence. (It must be remembered that the plaintiff applied for insurance to Mr. Logan, a local agent for the company at Amherst, Nova Scotia; that he had no power to issue a policy but only to solicit therefore that the policy issued from and was sent to the plaintiff by the provincial head office of the company at Halifax.) Mr. Jarvis's evidence is as follows:\nReside at St. John, N.B. I am a fire insurance agent and fire insurance adjuster. I have been thirty years in fire insurance, also in marine insurance. I am not an officer of the Atlas Insurance Company. I have done a good deal of adjusting of fire losses for that company. I get no regular salary for it, but I am paid the particular bill I put in in each case I adjust. In Nova Scotia Mr. Bell pays me. I have no authority of my own motion to go and adjust. I went at the request of Alfred J. Bell to adjust the loss in this case. Adjusting is to ascertain the amount of the loss from the evidence obtainable and to report on the circumstances of the loss. I am not appointed until the fire takes place. I have nothing to do with receiving the notice of loss or putting in the proofs, no authority or instruction in that respect at all. I did not represent myself to plaintiff as having any such authority.\nThis evidence is not disputed. The plaintiffs' case is that Jarvis told him that he had thirty days within which to deliver his proofs of loss, whereas the condition requires the proofs to be in within fifteen days.\nI told him (he swears), the people I traded with where he would get the invoices. He said to send and get others as soon as I could as it should be made out within thirty days\u2014the proofs of loss (objected.) He said the proofs of loss should be in on or within thirty days.\nJarvis swears,\nI did not tell him he had thirty days to put proofs in. If he had asked I would have told him correctly as to the time. I did not purport to waive the time and had no authority to do it nor did I do so.\nThis is the only evidence of waiver relied on. Jarvis never had the policy in his possession and never saw it. It was at the very time spoken of either in the possession of the plaintiff or of his solicitor, and he, the plaintiff, had a much better opportunity of knowing what its contents were than Jarvis. The jury, however, upon this evidence, found, as is usual in such cases, that Jarvis induced the plaintiff to delay sending in his proofs within the stipulated time.\nIt is clear from the evidence that at the time this alleged conversation between Jarvis and the plaintiff took place the fifteen days had expired and that the policy had then become void by reason of failure to produce the proofs of loss within the stipulated time. These are, I think, all the facts bearing upon the case so far as necessary to determine this appeal.\nI am of opinion that whatever Jarvis's authority may have been, and whether under given circumstances he might not have had power to extend the time within which the proofs of loss might be given notwithstanding the fifteen days condition in the policy, yet inasmuch as fifteen days after the fire the policy had become absolutely forfeited by reason of failure of delivery of the proofs nothing that Jarvis could thereafter do without the express authority of the company could reinstate it and revive the company's liability upon it.\nI am further of opinion that the evidence does not dislcose any facts from which it can be inferred that the company waived the condition. At the time of the conversation relied on twenty-seven days after the fire the policy as I have said had already become forfeited. Nothing within those twenty-seven days that Jarvis had said or done could have induced the plaintiff to alter his position in any way, nor so far as I can see was his position altered in consequence of what he says Jarvis told him, nor does he even allege that his position was in any way changed. In addition to that besides assuming the plaintiff's statement to be true he merely asked Jarvis for his opinion, which it must be presumed he honestly gave, and that he believed the contents of the policy was as he stated. Had the policy been in Jarvis's possession, and had he been the only one capable of giving the information asked for there might be something to be said in favour of the plaintiffs' view, but all the time it was in his own possession or in that of his solicitor as he knew, and the proper method to ascertain what these stipulations were was to peruse the policy itself or to inquire from its custodian what they were. I cannot see that Jarvis's answer to his question, assuming it to have been as stated, was anything more than if his own solicitor had made it, or even any stranger.\nNor do I think that Jarvis had any authority, whether within or beyond the fifteen days, by any act or representation of his, to extend the time limit in question. I am inclined to think that the name which he gives to his profession, namely that of an insurance adjuster, is somewhat inaccurate. To adjust an insurance loss in my view implies a dealing between two or more parties, a settlement or determination of something in dispute, a fixing of an amount in respect of which there has been a controversy, but that, it would appear from the evidence, was no part of Mr. Jarvis's duty or within the scope of his authority. He was simply appointed to make inquiries, investigate and report to his employers what in his view was the amount of loss sustained. Had he the larger power to which I have just referred, then, as already stated, I am not prepared to determine the extent of his implied authority to bind the company so far as the making up and delivery of proofs of loss are concerned. But in the present case the evidence is that no such authority was possessed by him, and we must take his duties and powers to be no greater, no less, than the evidence shows them to have been.\nIt seems to me further that this case is settled by the decision of this court in Logan v. The Commercial Ins. Co.[21]. Condition twenty of the policy in that case was as follows: No condition of the policy, either in whole or in part, shall be deemed to have been waived by the company unless the waiver is clearly expressed in writing, signed by the company's manager in Montreal,\nthe same condition as in the present case. There the waiver was of the condition in respect to the certificate of two magistrates most contiguous to the place of the fire. There the evidence of the authority of Salter, the Halifax agent of the company, was much stronger than in the present case, and the jury found against the company. Upon appeal to this court the learned Chief Justice of this court at page 276 says as follows:\nI am of opinion that, irrespective altogether of the requirement of the 19th condition that any waiver should be in writing, there was no evidence showing that the stipulations as to the magistrate's certificate required by the 14th condition had been, in fact, waived in such a way as to bind the respondents, even if a verbal waiver had not been provided against. Salter, as agent, apart from the authority expressly conferred on him to waive in writing, had no power so to bind the respondents, and granting that the plaintiff's account of what passed at the interview at Halifax was, as the jury found, the true one, what was then said could not in any way have precluded the company from setting up the want of the certificate as a defence, simply for the reason given that Salter was exceeding his powers in assuming (even if the plaintiff's evidence is to be so construed) to dispense with it. Further, even if there could have been any doubt of this in the absence of the 19th condition, that condition clearly excludes any authority in the agent to waive otherwise than according to its terms. Lastly, there was not the slightest evidence of any waiver of the 19th condition itself, and moreover, it is manifest that nothing Salter, the agent, might have said, could have had the effect of enlarging the limited power to waive which the company had thought fit to impose upon him.\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court in Western Assurance Co. v. Doull[22], was to the same effect, Mr. Justice Henry in his judgment pointing out that any waiver would have to be evidenced by writing according to the terms of the condition. The only point remaining is that the condition requiring proofs of loss within fifteen days is not a condition precedent. This question was fully considered by this court in the recent case of The Employers Liability Co. v. Taylor[23], where most of the authorities upon the question were referred to. In that case it was held that a condition indorsed upon the policy to the effect that the assured was within twenty days after the accident to give notice to the company was held to be a condition precedent. In the present case the argument is much stronger in that view. The condition is,\nAny person entitled to make a claim under this policy is to observe the following directions. * * * He is to deliver within fifteen days after the fire, in writing, as particular an account of the loss as the nature of the case permits.\nThat, it seems to me, is equivalent to a stipulation that before any one can make any demand against the company or sue the company under the policy he must deliver the proofs within the fifteen days. To hold otherwise would be in effect to overrule the decision in the case referred to as well as to disturb the jurisprudence of both England and Canada upon this point as it has existed for many years.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Hector McInnes.\nSolicitor for the respondents: William T.

S.

The facts constituting the alleged negligence by which the injury was caused and the finding of the jury thereon are sufficiently stated in the above head note and in the judgment of Mr. Justice King on this appeal.\nW. B. A. Ritchie Q.C. and King Q.C. for the appellant. Drysdale Q.C. for the respondents.\nGWYNNE J., dissenting\u2014This case presents to my mind a painful instance of the miscarriage of justice and of the injury which is occasionally inflicted upon litigants by the law's delay.\nIn the month of May, 1892, the plaintiff sustained a very serious injury resulting in the loss of a leg while rendering service as a ship carpenter to the defendants on a schooner of theirs.\nThe cause of action is thus stated in the statement of claim.\n2. On the 6th day of May, 1892, the plaintiff was in the employ of one Young who was employed by the captain of the said schooner on behalf of the defendants to make such repairs in and upon the said schooner Topaz then lying at the port of Halifax as might be required and pointed out by said captain, and plaintiff had by said Young's instructions proceeded to the deck of said schooner for the purpose of doing any work that might be required of him by the captain of said vessel.\n3. In order to do said work, the plaintiff, under the direction of the said captain, was obliged to pass under, around and upon the boom of the said schooner and to remain there for some time in order to remove the band of said boom and repair the same, and it was necessary and the duty of the defendants, and the said captain undertook on their behalf, properly to secure the said boom, and then to turn the crutch of the same aside so as to expose the said band and the defects which they desired the plaintiff to repair, and the captain having represented to the plaintiff that the said boom had been properly secured and that all was in readiness for the said work to go forward, the plaintiff at the request of the said captain and under his direction proceeded to the said boom to repair the band thereof.\n4. Owing to the negligence of the servants of the defendants in discharging their said duty in wholly neglecting and omitting to secure the said boom, or in negligently, improperly and insufficiently securing the same, and in negligently, wrongfully and improperly swinging said boom to one side while the same remained improperly and insufficiently secured, and while the plaintiff in the discharge of his duty was astride the same the plaintiff was precipitated upon the deck of the said schooner and the said boom fell upon the plaintiff with great violence and broke and crushed his leg and crushed and paralized his left arm and shoulder and effected internal and other injuries.\nThe defendants in their statements of defence plead as follows:\n1. They do not admit that they are owners of the schooner Topaz.\n2. They deny that it was their duty to secure said boom.\n3. They deny that the captain undertook on their behalf or on behalf of either of them or at all to secure the said boom.\n4. They deny that the captain represented to the plaintiff that the said boom had been properly secured.\n5. They deny that they or any of their servants swung said boom while the plaintiff was astride the same or while he was engaged on said vessel.\n6. They aver and plead that the said boom was properly and sufficiently secured when the plaintiff began to work at the same, and that if the said boom afterwards became insecure it was made so by the plaintiff and not by the defendants or any of their servants.\n7. They aver and plead that the plaintiff by his own negligent acts in loosening the topping lift ropes contributed to the accident, and lastly\n8. They aver and plead that the plaintiff was a workman and was engaged as a fellow servant in one common service and employment with certain of defendants' servants who were also workmen and competent to do that work and the said injuries, if caused by negligence of any person or persons for whose negligence the defendants would be answerable (all of which is denied) were caused by defendants' said servants while they and the plaintiff were such fellow servants and engaged in such common service and employment, and in course thereof and not otherwise without any personal negligence or interference on the part of the defendants.\nIssue was joined on these pleas and the whole material question raised by such issue and which in fact the parties went down to try was: First, whether or not the defendants were under any obligation of duty arising either from the nature of the work on which the plaintiff was engaged or from express contract with the captain of the vessel as the defendants' agent to secure the boom; and secondly, whether the injury sustained by the plaintiff was caused by the negligence of the defendants as charged in the plaintiff's statement of claim or on the contrary by his own negligence as charged by the defendants in their statement of defence.\nThe case went down for trial first in 1893 when the learned trial judge took the case from the jury and rendered judgment for the defendants. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia sustained the judgment, but upon appeal to this court it was reversed and a new trial ordered. Accordingly the case was tried a second time in 1895 when a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff with $2,800 damages, but this verdict was set aside by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on the alleged ground of misdirection and the exclusion of certain questions from the jury and a new trial was again ordered. The third trial proved abortive by reason of the jury being unable to agree and the case was brought down to trial for the fourth time in 1897. It is against the result of this trial, namely a judgment in favour of the defendants rendered by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, the Chief Justice of that court dissenting that this appeal is taken. It was not disputed that the defendants were owners of the schooner and there was no evidence in support of the allegations contained in the eighth paragraph of the defendants' statement of defence, and in fact the sole contestation between the parties upon each of the trials was: First, whether as the defendants had denied in their statement of defence any duty or obligation lay upon the defendants to secure the boom; and secondly, whether the accident had happened as alleged by the plaintiff by reason of the negligence of the defendants or their servants in not properly securing the boom upon which the plaintiff was engaged in working, which the plaintiff alleges it was the duty of the defendants to do, and which, as he also alleges they, through the master of the schooner as their agent, expressly undertook to do, and assured the plaintiff was effectually done when he went to work on the boom or in negligently, wrongfully and improperly swinging the said boom on one side whilst the same remained improperly and insufficiently secured and while the plaintiff was engaged in working upon it or on the contrary was caused by the plaintiff's own negligence as alleged by the defendants in the sixth and seventh paragraphs of their statement of defence.\nNow by the plaintiffs uncontradicted evidence it appeared that he was sent by his employer, one Young, a master ship carpenter, to do what carpenter work the captain should require to be done on the schooner\u2014that the first thing pointed out by the captain to the plaintiff was the band on the main boom which the captain said must be taken off\u2014the plaintiff observed that there was no topping lift aloft and the boom was resting upon a crutch alone, in order to take the band off the boom it had to be taken out the crutch, and for that purpose it was a necessity that the boom should be secured by the topping lift. The captain said that this should be done so soon as he should return from Richmond where he was going to discharge his cargo and he then said to his mate \"when the carpenter takes off that band you assist him and see the boom secured.\"\nThe importance and in fact the absolute necessity of the topping lift being made secure to the boom arose from the fact established by undisputed evidence that when the boom should be taken out of the crutch it would be held up by the topping lift alone, and if that should not be securely fastened, the boom as soon as the crutch should be removed must fall upon the deck, and on the contrary that the boom could not fall if the topping lift should be properly fastened.\nThe plaintiff further said that on the morning of the 6th May, 1892, while he was doing other repairs upon the vessel as required by the captain, the latter said to him \"carpenter you have forgotten the band\" to which the plaintiff replied \"no I have not forgotten the band but you have forgotten to secure the boom\" whereupon the captain said \"is not the topping lift aloft,\" and on the plaintiff answering \"no\" the captain addressing one Willis, a rigger employed on the vessel, said \"why don't you put up that topping lift and secure the boom,\" whereupon Willis and some others proceeded to put up the topping lift and had it up at about 11 o'clock, and then the same persons proceeded to unbend the mainsail in taking down which two or three men were working on the boom. This work was completed about one o'clock and before the plaintiff went to work on the boom at all. The plaintiff also said that while taking his dinner on the vessel he asked the captain if the boom was secured and that he said it was, with all new gear, and that the plaintiff need not be afraid, whereupon the captain went ashore after having given directions to the mate to assist the plaintiff.\nThe evidence as so far extracted was undisputed and having regard to the nature of the work required to be done, namely the removal of the band from the boom, and to the necessity, established by the evidence in order to the performance of that work, that the boom should be removed from resting on the crutch and should depend for its sole support so as to prevent its falling and injuring the plaintiff, upon the topping lift being securely fastened to it, it cannot, in my opinion, admit of a doubt that a duty and obligation rested on the defendants, as well from the nature of the service required to be rendered by the plaintiff as from the express undertaking and assurance of the captain to take care that the boom should have been so fastened, and that the duration of such duty and obligation was co-extensive with the period during which the plaintiff should be engaged in the performance of his work (undertaken upon the faith of the boom being so secured) and exposed to danger in the event of its proving not to be securely fastened, to hold that any less duty rested upon the defendants would be utterly illusory and would be in effect to hold as the defendants in their statement of defence plead that no duty to the plaintiff to secure the boom rested upon them.\nThe plaintiff having gone to work on the boom on the assurance of the captain that it was secured and that plaintiff had nothing to fear gives this account of the accident which befell him.\nThere was, he says, a mat over the band of the boom which the captain had asked him not to destroy. He got on the boom to take the mat off and having loosened it he was taking off the band when, as he says, the mate who was, by the captain's directions, assisting him to take off the band, cast off the crutch tackle and instantly the boom fell on the plaintiff and crushed his leg from the knee down; the guy, he said, had to be cast off to let the crutch out to enable the plaintiff to go on with his work, and the mate said \"we will have to cast off this guy\" to which the plaintiff says he did not object. The mate said that the plaintiff told him to unhook the crutch tackle which he did, but this variation in the evidence is immaterial for the evidence is conclusive that if the topping lift had been properly secured the boom could not have fallen. It thus appears that within about two hours after the topping lift was put up and almost immediately after the defendants' riggers had ceased working on the boom in bending down the mainsail and upon the very instant of the removal of the boom from the crutch to provide against any damage arising from which the boom was required to be secured by the topping lift the accident happened, in short eo instanti of the topping lift being required to render the service for the purpose of rendering which it was put up it failed. The plaintiff throughout all the trials which have been had in this case has persistently contended that upon this evidence the defendants are responsible to the plaintiff for the injuries sustained by him as occasioned by the negligence of the defendants' servants, such negligence consisting in the inefficient manner in which the topping lift served the purpose for which, in discharge of a duty due from the defendants to the plaintiff it was put up.\nThe defendants on the contrary besides denying that they owed any duty to the plaintiff to secure the boom, insist that the topping lift was properly secured and that it became insecure afterwards either as pleaded by the defendants in their statement of defence by some careless conduct of the plaintiff himself or else from some other unknown and unsuggested cause for which the defendants contend that they cannot be held to be responsible. As to the topping lift having been secured the defendants called one Allan who said that he was the man who fastened the topping lift to the cleat. He, there is no doubt, said that he had fastened it properly\u2014that it could not have become unfastened unless it had been interfered with after he left it. The topping lift he said, was a new one, of wire rope, he could not say with certainty whether the sheet was stretched before putting it on, but he said, \"when I fasten a piece of rope on a vessel I know I do right. I hauled the sheet taut and made it fast on the cleat,\" and he is one of the many witnesses who testified that \"the boom could not fall even if the crutch were removed if the topping lift had been properly secured.\" Now the only interference with the boom after the topping lift was put up is shewn by the evidence, to have been caused by those same riggers who had put up the topping lift and who continued to be engaged for about two hours more in working on the boom in bending down the mainsail. There does not appear in the case any evidence to justify the conclusion that the plaintiff by any act of his, as pleaded by the defendants, had caused, or contributed to the causing of the accident, and there does not appear to have been any one upon the vessel but the plaintiff and the servants of the defendants who were engaged in putting up the topping lift and rigging the vessel.\nWillis who was in charge over the men so employed said that he looked at the cleat immediately after the accident and that the rope was entirely clear of it and the boom was down on the starboard side. He did not examine the cleat, nor the way the rope was belayed around it; he said he did not need to look at that because he goes upon what he believes his man did. There is, he said, a proper way of taking a turn \"in the cleat\" and added \"I can't say it was properly belayed. If not properly fastened the fall would run around the cleat when the strain came suddenly upon it.\" Now under these circumstances and notwithstanding the evidence of the witness Allan who said that he was the one who had put up the topping lift the fact of its failure, upon the very instant of its being called upon to serve the purpose for which it was required to be securely fastened to the boom, coupled with the fact of there having been no explanation offered in evidence reasonably to account for its becoming unfastened without fault of the defendants if it had been properly secured, and the undisputed testimony that if it had been properly secured the accident could not have happened, seem to afford conclusive proof that the topping lift never had been properly fastened\u2014that seems to be the natural and rational inference to draw from the evidence. The suggestion that the topping lift could have become unfastened in the presence of the defendants' servants employed on the vessel from some unknown cause within about two hours after it was properly fastened, and that therefore the defendants are exculpated appears to be quite illusory.\nThere cannot, I think, be entertained a doubt that the defendants owed a duty to the plaintiff to secure the topping lift to the boom in such a manner as to prevent as far as practicable the occurrence of its falling when the crutch should be removed which was the event against the consequences of which the plaintiff required that the boom should be secured. That it was practicable so to fasten it was not denied, and that it was not done is beyond doubt. It was argued that to impose such a duty on the defendants would be to make them insurers of the plaintiff against all damage that might be occasioned to him by the falling of the boom. Well there is no hardship in holding that they are insurers against damage occasioned by the non-execution or the imperfect execution by them of a work which was capable of being made practically effective, and which it was the duty of the defendants to have made as effective as practicable. It could only be during the period that the plaintiff was working on the boom that they owed to him the duty of keeping it secured from falling; except while so employed the defendants owed the plaintiff no such duty, nor was it of any importance to him whether the boom was so secured, but if it was not properly secured during that period and by reason thereof it fell and did injury to the plaintiff then the defendants have failed to discharge the duty they owed the plaintiff and so are liable to him in this action. This must be so unless the defendants are entitled to succeed upon the issue joined upon the first paragraph of their statement of defence namely, that they owed no duty whatever to the plaintiff to secure the boom.\nThe learned trial judge submitted certain questions to the jury, some of which they answered, some they did not. It is only necessary to refer to the three following:\n1. What was the proximate cause of the injury?\n2. Was it occasioned by the negligent act or omission of the defendants or their servants?\n3. Could the plaintiff by the exercise of ordinary care have avoided the consequence of the accident?\nTo the first question the jury answered as follows:\nThe falling of the boom owing to the topping lift sheet not being secured.\nTo the second they answered \"no,\" and to the third \"yes.\" The natural and reasonable construction of the above answer of the jury to the first question is that the jury were of opinion as the evidence as already pointed out fully warranted that the topping lift never had been properly secured. This appears also to have been the finding of the jury on the second trial. That it was not secured at the only time when it was of any importance that it should be secured is undisputed. It is now contended however that the jury in the recent trial having answered the second question in the negative must have meant that the defendants had properly secured the topping lift as stated by Allan, but that it had subsequently become unfastened by some unknown cause not constituting negligence of the defendants. Such a strained construction cannot be put upon the answers of the jury. It is not very intelligible how, the cause being unknown, there having been none in evidence the jury could intelligently say that it did not constitute negligence in the defendants; moreover such a construction put upon the answers of the jury implies that the jury have assumed to determine matters which they were not competent to decide, namely, that the defendants owed no duty to the plaintiff to keep the boom secured while he was working upon it, and that its not having been secure during that period constituted no negligence in the defendants. The difficulty which has arisen from the conflicting answers of the jury to the first and second questions is, I think, attributable to confusion in the minds of the jury both as to what was the duty which the defendants owed to the plaintiff and what constituted negligence in the discharge of such duty.\nThen as to the third question. It is difficult to see what was meant by this question or upon what material the jury could have been expected intelligently to answer whether the plaintiff could, and in what manner have avoided the consequence of an accident which there was no evidence to justify the finding that he had either caused or contributed to the causing of.\nUpon the whole for the above reasons and for those given in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in his dissenting judgment I am of opinion that this appeal must be allowed and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia set aside with costs and that a rule for another trial, without costs, must be ordered to issue in the court below.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nKING J.\u2014This is an action to recover damages for injuries sustained by the plaintiff while working on board a vessel owned and managed by defendants. The vessel was lying in the port of Halifax and work was being done on her spars and rigging. The defendants employed a master carpenter to do the carpenter work who sent the plaintiff with others on board with instructions to do such work as they might be directed by the master of the vessel to do. A master rigger was also employed, and he also sent several men aboard with the like instructions. Amongst the things which the master of the vessel required of the plaintiff was the removal of an iron band from near the outer end of the main boom. In order to the doing of this it was considered by the plaintiff necessary that the boom should be taken out of a crutch in which it was resting for support. When the plaintiff was directed by the master to do this work he pointed out to the latter that it could not then be safely attempted as the topping lift had been removed\u2014the topping lift being that part of the rigging running from the mast head to the end of the boom and by which the boom is ordinarily supported. The master acquiesced in this very obvious view and said that he would have a topping lift set up, and accordingly he directed the riggers to do it.\nAllan, one of the riggers, says:\nWe put a new topping lift on the main boom between 8 and 10 a.m. I made it fast to the cleat myself. I fastened the topping lift sheet properly. It could not have slipped or become unfastened had it not been interfered with after I left it. * * * The boom could not fall even if the crutch were removed if the topping lift had been properly secured. * * * I hauled the sheet fast and made it fast on the cleat.\nThe topping lift sheet thus referred to was a manilla rope attached to the lower end of the topping lift and which after passing through a sheave in the boom was led forward and made fast to a cleat upon the boom near the mast.\nSeveral hours afterwards the riggers, assisted by the mate and one of the crew, unbent the mainsail. In this operation two or three men were at work on the main boom, but there is no evidence that the fastening of the topping lift sheet was disturbed.\nSoon afterwards the plaintiff went to work upon the main boom to remove the band. When the boom was taken out of the crutch and its weight came upon the topping lift, this was found to be insufficiently secured, and the boom fell to the deck injuring the plaintiff. Upon the trial before Mr. Justice Townshend the jury found, in answer to questions, that the injury was caused by the falling of the boom owing to the topping lift sheet not being secured, but that this was not occasioned by the negligent act or omission of defendants or their servants. Judgment was thereupon entered for the defendants and was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (per Graham and Ritchie JJ., Macdonald C.J. dissenting.) The reported notes of the charge of the learned trial judge are meagre, but, so far as the argument here went, its adequacy to the circumstances of the case is not impugned.\nThe defendants owed to the plaintiff a duty to take reasonable care to provide that the tackle and appliances upon which he would have to depend for his safety in doing defendants' work were maintained in a proper state and condition. In Heaven v. Pender[2] Cotton and Bowen, L. JJ. (p. 515) say as applied to the facts in that case:\nTo these persons, (i.e. persons going to the vessel in dock for the purpose of repairing her,) the dock owner was under an obligation to take reasonable care that at the time the appliances provided for immediate use in the dock were provided by him they were in a fit state to be used, that is in such a state as not to expose those who might use them for the repair of the ship to any danger or risk not necessarily incident to the service in which they were employed.\nThe corresponding duty as between employer and employed is stated by Lord Herschell in Smith v. Baker & Sons[3] in these terms:\nIt is quite clear that the contract between employer and employed involves on the part of the former the duty of taking reasonable care to provide proper appliances and to maintain them in a proper condition, and so to carry on his operations as not to subject those employed by him to unnecessary risk.\nReasonable care is matter of degree dependent upon the particular facts of each case, and is in all cases a question of fact, where there is any substantial evidence on the point at all. There is nothing in the evidence warranting a conclusion that the plaintiff was himself to attend to the securing of the tackle. The obligation, such as it was, was upon the defendants alone. The jury having found that the topping lift sheet was not secured, there was, so far, and in the result, a failure to insure that which was, or ought to have been the object of defendants' care. But that is not enough; and the further finding that the accident was not occasioned by the negligent act or omission of the defendants or their servants negatives the conclusion that such result arose from any want of reasonable and proper care on their part.\nIf (as contended) the first answer of the jury is to be construed as meaning that the sheet was not at any time secured, then this omission could not well be reconciled with the exercise of proper care. But such interpretation is to be given to the findings as will, if possible, render them consistent. The words \"the topping lift sheet not being secured,\" taken in connection with the question to which it forms part of the answer, point to the facts and causes in existence and operative at the precise time of the accident, and are not to be construed as if they were, \"the topping lift sheet not having been secured.\"\nThe learned counsel for the appellant addressed to us a very strong argument to show that the sheet having been found not secured at the time of the accident it either had never been properly secured or, having been secured, as testified to by the rigger Allan, it afterwards was suffered to become and remain unsecured through the negligence of the defendants. There may be (and probably is) a preponderance of reason in favour of this view, but its weight is not so considerable as to leave no room for a different opinion. The opinion of the learned Chief Justice in dissenting is, upon this part of the case, a very able presentation of the like view, and if we were free to deal with the facts apart from the opinion of the jury it might appear decisive; but there is the finding of the jury upon a matter entirely one of fact and in respect of which their observation and experience might qualify them peculiarly to judge, and we do not think that we ought to ignore such findings. The result of this view is that the appeal should be dismissed,\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: King & Barss.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Hector McInnes.\n[1] 30 N.

C. Rep. 260) affirmed, Gwynne and Sedgewick JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nThe action was brought to recover from defendant the plaintiff's share of the proceeds of the sale by defendant of the mineral claim which the parties owned in partnership. The facts are not in dispute and the appeal involves only the decision of two questions of law, namely:\n1. Does the Mineral Act of 1896 prevent the plaintiff from recovering where he did not hold a free miner's certificate when he brought his action?\n2. Does the Statute of Frauds apply to the case of a partnership formed by parol agreement for dealing in lands?\nThe provision of the Mineral Act relied on by defendant is the following:\n\"Subject to the proviso hereinafter stated, no person or joint stock company shall be recognized as having any right or interest in or to any mineral claim, or any minerals therein, or in or to any water right, mining, ditch, drain, tunnel, or flume, unless he or it shall have a free miner's certificate unexpired.\" The proviso does not affect this case.\nThe trial judge non-suited the plaintiff for want of a certificate under the Act. His judgment was reversed by the full court whereupon the defendant took this appeal.\nChristopher Robinson Q.G. for the appellant. As to the want of a certificate under the Mineral Act being a bar to this action, see McCormick v. Grogan[2]. McPherson & Clarke on Mines, p. 695 et seq.\nThe Statute of Frauds applies to the case of a partnership in lands. Stuart v. Mott[3]; Dale v. Hamilton[4]; Maddison v. Alderson[5].\nAs to the objection that the statute cannot be relied on to support a fraud, see Rochefoucauld v. Boustead[6]. Moreover this was not a partnership ; Kay v. Johnston[7] ; Lindley on Partnership (6 ed.) p. 52.\nS. H. Blake Q.C. and Latchford for the respondent, referred on the question of the Mineral Act to Bainbridge on Mines, (4 ed.) 541 and 545 where co\u2014ownership and partnership are dealt with.\nAs to the Statute of Frauds, see Browne on Statute of Frauds (6 ed.) p. 261; Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, vol. 17 p. 99 ; In re Duke of Marlborough ; Davis v. Whitehead[8]; Heard v. Pilley[9] ; Haigh v. Kaye[10] ; Chester v. Dickerson[11].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014In July, 1895, the appellant, the respondent and one Murchie, formed a partnership to deal in mining claims. That this partnership existed was found by the jury, and it is recognised as having been so found by the learned judge, Mr. Justice Irving, before whom the action was tried, as appears from his judgment pronounced on entering the verdict.\nAfter having acquired and sold several claims, in June, 1896, the partnership acquired a claim which was known as the \"Blanch Lamont.\" This claim they allowed to lapse, but afterwards acquired an interest in it again under the denomination of the \"Dorothy Morton.\" This claim was taken out in the name of one Chick, who in consideration of doing the necessary work and recording the claim was to have half of it. Chick thereupon assigned an undivided one-half interest to the appellant for the behoof of the partnership, retaining the other half for himself.\nOn the 19th July, 1897, Chick and the partnership sold the whole claim for $20,000 and the purchasers at once took possession. There do not appear to be any outstanding debts or claims due by or made against the partnership, and the $10,000 was therefore on its being paid to the appellant a net sum in his hands to be divided amongst the three partners each being prima facie entitled to one\u2014third of the amount.\nThe respondent had a free miner's certificate from the date of the formation of the partnership up to the time of the sale of the claim and afterwards until the 26th of July, but he allowed this certificate to lapse on the 26th of July, 1897, not renewing it till the 8th of August, 1897. The purchase money was not paid to the appellant until after the 26th of July, but soon after that date it was paid, one-half to Chick and the other moiety amounting to $10,000 to the appellant for the behoof of the partnership.\nThe respondent brought this action for the recovery of $3,325, his share of the purchase money remaining in the appellant's hands.\nAt the trial before Mr. Justice Irving and a jury it appeared on the pleadings as they originally stood after the jury had found the facts that there was no real defence to the action, but the learned judge permitted the appellant to amend his statement of defence by setting up the Statute of Frauds and the fact of the lapse of the respondent's free miner's certificate at the date mentioned and the Mineral Act of British Columbia. And upon this latter ground the learned judge nonsuited the respondent, who appealed to the Supreme Court in banc where the first judgment was reversed and a judgment ordered to be entered for the respondent for the amount sued for. No question of fact is in dispute ; the jury found there was a partnership agreement, and the appellant in his factum concedes this and admits that the only questions are the two questions of law as to whether the respondent is to be debarred from recovering his share of the money by reason of the statutory defences set up by the amendment. The passage in the factum referred to is the following ; at page 15 the appellant says:\nThe finding of the jury settles all questions of fact leaving only two defences open to the defendant, both of which are questions of law.\nAs regards the Mineral Act it ceased to have any application when the claim had been sold and nothing remained but the money arising from the sale made whilst the respondent had his certificate; from that time he had no interest in the claim which had been alienated and converted into a mere money demand by the sale, and the money when it came into the hands of the appellant was therefore impressed with a trust for the respondent to the amount of one-third. To say that the respondent has forfeited his right to this money representing a mining claim in which he had ceased to have any interest, and not even arising directly out of the sale but being money had and received to the use of the respondent by the appellant, would be not only enlarging the words of the statute, but would be placing upon it an arbitrary and unreasonable construction, not warranted either by its language or by a consideration of the object which it had in view. Even if the action had been one to recover the price from the purchasers the Act could not have applied, much less can it apply between the present parties where no mining right is in question. If the respondent had died after the sale and before the payment of the money it might just as well be said that his executors could not have recovered because they had not mining certificates. Could it be said that where a partnership of this kind had been dissolved for years, and the parties had abandoned the pursuit of mining altogether and had left the mining country, that one of the partners on discovering that the other partner owed him money upon the footing of the partnership accounts, could be precluded from recovering that money because he had not kept up his free miner's license? Such an application of the statute would be absurd, but yet it would follow that the certificate was in such a case necessary to entitle the party to sue, if we should give effect to the objection in the present case.\nAs to the Statute of Frauds, that can have no application. It never applies to exclude parol evidence of a partnership for dealing in land. This was determined as far back as the case of Forster v. Hale[12], for we find Lord Loughborough in that case saying :\nThat was not the question ; it was whether there was a partnership. The subject being an agreement for land, the question then is whether there was a resulting trust for that partnership by operation of law. The question of partnership must be tried as a fact and as if there was an issue upon it. If by facts and circumstances it is established as a fact that these persons were partners in the colliery in which land was necessary to carry on the trade the lease goes as an incident. The partnership being established by evidence upon which a partnership may be found, the premises necessary for the purposes of that partnership are by operation of the law held for the purposes of that partnership.\nIn Dale v. Hamilton[13], Vice Chancellor Wigram expressly decided that a partnership formed for the sole purpose of dealing in land like that in question here might be proved by parol, and although Lord Cottenham on appeal decided on another ground holding that there was written evidence, he expressed no disapproval of this doctrine applied by the Vice Chancellor. In Caddick v. Skidmore[14], cited for the appellant, no partnership was proved. In Gray v. Smith[15], Mr. Justice Kekewich recognises the authorities before quoted to have established the law for he says: The first point raised upon that was whether it was necessary for such a contract that there should be an acknowledgment in writing signed by the party to be charged within the meaning of the Statute of Frauds? The authorities when looked into seem to establish that you may have an agreement of partnership by parol notwithstanding that the partnership is to deal with land. This was established by the case of Forster v. Hale[16], and in Dale v. Hamilton[17], Wigram V.C. went a step further and said that the same rule would hold good where the partnership was to deal exclusively with land, and he proceeded to apply it to such a case.\nI take it to be established now that a partnership may always be proved by parol, and if it turns out that the assets consist of lands, or interests in land bought for the purpose of being sold again, such lands will be treated as any other property not coming within the statute. The principle is this ; all assets of a partnership are considered as personalty, and that upon an application of the doctrine of equitable conversion, for ultimately in order to a winding up of the partnership everything must be sold and converted into money. This is applied to other questions besides that of the applicability of the Statute of Frauds, for instance in a partnership for dealing in land the lands acquired are not considered as realty going to the heir of one of the partners but as belonging to the personal representative for whom a court of equity treats the heirs as a trustee. Darby v. Darby[18] ; Wylie v. Wylie[19].\nI find it laid down in a text book published during the present year (Thompson on Equity, p. 603), that this is now the accepted doctrine in England. It is there said :\nA partnership may be constituted by a mere parol agreement notwithstanding that the partnership is to deal with land.\nI agree entirely in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia, and for the reasons before stated I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The only claim relied upon by the plaintiff in this action is an agreement in the 5th paragraph of the statement of claim alleged to have been entered into between the plaintiff, the defendant, one Murchie and one P. J. Chick. There is no evidence in the case before us of any such agreement having been entered into. There is in fact no evidence produced in the appeal case, and in the absence of evidence of the agreement relied upon by the plaintiff it appears to me to be impossible to render justice in the premises. The appeal I think should be allowed and the case remitted to a new trial.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the original judgment restored.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Harris & Bull.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.

The second paragraph of the order in the judgment appealed from is as follows:\n\u201c2. And this court doth further declare that the plaintiff is entitled to a charge upon the north twenty-five acres of the east three-quarters of the east half of lot 12, in the eleventh concession of the Township of Howard, in the County of Kent (to the extent or sum of $400, * * *) as security for the due execution by the said Mary Elizabeth Wilbur and Levi Wilbur, of a conveyance to the plaintiff granting, remising, releasing and forever quitting claim to the plaintiff, her heirs or assigns, all and every right, title and interest which they or either of them may have now or hereafter, into or out of the south-east two-thirds divided crosswise of the north-easterly three-quarters divided lengthwise, of the north-easterly half divided lengthwise of lot number twelve in the eleventh concession of the said Township of Howard, containing fifty acres more or less.\nGundy for the appellants.\nJohn A. Robinson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014So exhaustively has this case (the value of what is in contest in which is admitted to be only $400), been treated by the judgments in the courts below that it is unnecessary to review the facts or to do more as to them than to say as is pointed out in those judgments, that the object of the parties in entering into the agreement which they did enter into for the partition among them of the lands in question was to give to each a fee simple estate in the portions conveyed to each, and that the defendant Margaret Wilbur should procure from her children upon their coming of age quitclaim deeds in favour of Freeman Green and of Mrs. Ward respectively of whatever interest they might have in the lands. The evidence also establishes that the agreement as taken down by the solicitor employed by the parties for the purpose and signed by them is correctly recited in all of the deeds as prepared by the solicitor for execution. That in favour of the appellant was signed by Mr. Wilbur and her husband, and that in favour of Mrs. Wilbur by the appellant. In these deeds the agreement is recited as follows:\nWhereas the said Margaret Wilbur, Palmer R. Wilbur, Elizabeth Ward, Freeman Green and David Green, each having or claiming to have an individual interest or share in the east half, otherwise the northeasterly half divided lengthwise of lot number twelve, in the eleventh concession of the Township of Howard, in the County of Kent and Province of Ontario, have agreed to a partition and purchase of the said part of the said lot on the following conditions, namely, the said Freeman Green shall take and receive the southwesterly quarter of said northeasterly half of said lot divided lengthwise, and shall receive from said Elizabeth Ward the sum of two hundred dollars, and shall pay to the said David Green the sum of one hundred dollars. The said Margaret Wilbur shall take and receive the northwest one-third of the remaining three-quarters of said northeasterly half of said lot, and shall receive from the said Elizabeth Ward the sum of three hundred dollars, and shall pay to the said David Green the sum of three hundred dollars, and shall also further pay to Mary Elizabeth Wilbur and Levi Wilbur, the only surviving children of the said Margaret Wilbur and Palmer R. Wilbur (the other children of the said Margaret and Palmer Wilbur having died intestate and without issue), any moneys that may be due to them, if any, out of said lands, and shall also obtain for the said Freeman Green and Elizabeth Ward quit claim deeds from the said Mary Elizabeth Wilbur and Levi Wilbur respectively when they shall severally arrive at the age of twenty-one years. The said payments to the said Mary Elizabeth Wilbur and Levi Wilbur are hereby declared to be and remain a lien on the part of said lands taken by the said Margaret Wilbur until any money due to the said Mary Elizabeth Wilbur and Levi Wilbur are fully paid and the said quitclaim deeds are obtained from them and delivered to the said Freeman Green and Elizabeth Ward. And the said Elizabeth Ward shall take and receive the southeast two-thirds of the said remaining three-fourths of said half lot being the remainder thereof and shall pay to the said Margaret Wilbur three hundred dollars, to the said Freeman Green two hundred dollars, and to the said David Green two hundred dollars. And whereas the said parties have agreed to execute and deliver proper deeds of conveyance to carry out the above partition and purchase and to pay the said payments as above set forth, and that Palmer R. Wilbur, the husband of the said Margaret Wilbur, and the wives of the said Freeman Green and David Green, respectively, shall join in the said deeds and bar their respective dowers.\nThe intention of all the parties being, by reason of the claim of David Green that the wills of his deceased sisters were invalid, to come to an arrangement among themselves for a partition of the estate in question between them in fee simple, and as the interests of Mrs. Wilbur\u2019s children could not be bound by anything done to their prejudice during their minority it was natural and indeed necessary to give any validity to the contemplated partition for the effecting which the plaintiff was paying $700 that Mrs. Wilbur and her share in the lands partitioned should be required to assume the responsibility of procuring the necessary quitclaim deeds to be executed by her children on their coming of age. There is no question before us as to whether the partition as made was fair and equitable to all the parties to it.\nThat the agreement was entered into is conclusively established by the evidence of the solicitor who took it down from the lips of the parties who signed it in the solicitor\u2019s presence as his instructions to prepare the necessary deeds, and the only question before us is whether or not that agreement as recited in the deed in virture of which Mrs. Wilbur acquired the portion of the land allotted to her justifies and supports the charge imposed upon it by the second paragraph of the judgment which is appealed from and we are of opinion that the charge so imposed is in accordance with the agreement recited in the deed, and upon the faith of which alone the land mentioned in the deed was conveyed to Mrs. Wilbur, and having accepted the land upon the faith of that agreement the appellants as claiming under her and a party to the same agreement must fulfil its terms.\nWe cannot but express our surprise that a solicitor to whom these deeds were sent for the mere purpose of witnessing their execution should have permitted Mr. Wilbur to make the alteration which he did in the recital of the agreement in the deed to the plaintiff, and we concur in the judgment of the courts below that notwithstanding the evidence of the solicitor who permitted the alteration without any authority to do so, the plaintiff did not understand and could not have understood the fact and the intent of the alteration, but our judgment rests not solely upon her ignorance of the fact or her misunderstanding of anything which may have been said to her as to the fact or the intent of the alteration, but also upon this, that the alteration made by Mr. Wilbur is only in the deed to Mrs. Ward, whereas the deed to determine the liability of Mrs. Wilbur, and of the appellant as purchaser from her and her husband, is the deed in virtue of which Mrs. Wilbur, until the sale to the appellant, held, and in virtue of which the appellant now holds the land conveyed to Mrs. Wilbur in pursuance of the agreement between the parties thereto and therein recited, and the true construction of the agreement recited in that deed, we think, is that the land conveyed to Mrs. Wilbur on the faith of the agreement is bound to indemnify the plaintiff against the claims of Mrs. Wilbur\u2019s children, who are now of age. The appeal therefore must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.E. Gundy.\nSolicitor for the respondent: John A. Robinson.\n"}

Baltic including engines, &c., \u201cwhilst running on the inland lakes, rivers and canals during the season of navigation. To be laid up in a place of safety during winter months from any extra hazardous building.\u201d The Baltic was laid up in 1893 and was never afterwards sent to sea. In 1896 she was destroyed by fire.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (25 Ont. App. R. 393) that the policy never attached; that the steamship was only insured while employed on inland waters during the navigation season or laid up in safety during the winter months.\nHeld also, that the above stipulation was not a condition but rather a description of the subject matter of the insurance and did not come within sec. 115 of the Ontario Insurance Act relating to variations from statutory conditions.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming by an equal division of the court the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff brought actions against seven insurance companies on policies insuring his S.S. Baltic against loss by fire. The action against the Alliance Assurance Co. was tried and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff, and on the company appealing it was agreed that the evidence on that trial should be treated as the evidence in all the cases. The appeal resulted in the verdict at the trial being sustained by an equal division in the Court of Appeal. The Alliance Assurance Co. then settled with the plaintiff, the other six companies joining in an appeal to this court.\nWallace Nesbitt and McKay for the appellant referred to Slinkard v. Manchester Fire Assur. Co.[2]; Benicia Agricultural Works v. Germania Ins. Co.[3]; Pearson v. Commercial Union Assur. Co.[4]\nOsler Q.C. and Douglas for the respondent cited Wanless v. Lancashire Ins. Co.[5]; Goring v. London Mutual Fire Ins. Co.[6]; Parsons v. Queen\u2019s Ins. Co.[7]\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014On the 5th September, 1896, the steamer Baltic owned by The Great Northern Transit Company, Limited, the present respondents, was burned while in dock at Collingwood, Georgian Bay. At the time of the fire she was insured against fire to the amount of $11,000 in seven companies, all of them except the Alliance Assurance Company being the present appellants. The companies having disputed their liability actions were brought and one of these cases was tried before Armour C.J., with a jury at Toronto in September, 1897. Judgment was there given in favour of the plaintiffs, which judgment was sustained upon appeal by an equally divided court, Maclennan and Moss JJ. being of opinion that the judgment should stand, the Chief Justice and Osler J. dissenting. The appeal is from that judgment to this court. It is an admitted fact that the last trip of the Baltic was made in the season of 1893. In September of 1893 she was laid up at Collingwood and from that date she never again went to sea. It also appeared that during 1894, 1895 and 1896 she never obtained a certificate of inspection provided by the Dominion Act without which she could not have been run; that her planking, her frames and her engine bed were in such a condition that it would have been impossible for her to have been moved from her position by her own motive power; that her electric light plant and certain portions of her furniture had been removed, and that she was in such a condition that she could not in any sense be described as a running boat.\nOnly two questions are raised; first, as to whether at the time of the fire the vessel insured came within the risk described in the policy; and secondly, as to whether the provisions of the Ontario Fire Insurance Act in regard to conditions had been or should have been complied with.\nThe wording of the description of the risk in each of the policies is identical and is as follows:\nOn the hull of the S.S. Baltic, including engines, boilers and appurtenances thereto, anchors, chains, masts, spars, rigging, sails, cabin and office furniture, beds, bedding, linen, silverware and platedware, cutlery, china, glassware and earthenware, looking glasses, mirrors, wheelbarrows, trucks, clocks and apparel on board said steamer whilst running on the inland lakes, rivers and canals during the season of navigation.\nTo be laid up in a place of safety during winter months from any extra hazardous building.\nOrdinary outfit to be allowed in winter and spring.\nIt is understood and agreed that the steamer insured under this policy has permission to carry merchandise, hazardous and non-hazardous, as freight from port to port with one barrel of coal oil for steamer\u2019s use.\nAnd the controversy mainly turns upon the interpretation to be given to the words \u201cwhilst running on the inland lakes, rivers and canals during the season of navigation.\u201d\nThree contentions have been put forward:\nThe first (and it is that upon which the judgment of the trial judge is based and is followed by Mr. Justice Maclennan in the Court of Appeal) is that the clause was intended to confine the risk to fire whilst the vessel was inland, whether on the lakes, rivers or canals during the season of navigation, and not upon the ocean, the emphatic word being inland as distinguished from ocean. In other words, that the clause might read \u201cwhilst being (whether running or laid up) in the inland lakes, rivers and canals during the season of navigation, but not on the ocean or in any ocean port.\u201d Another interpretation is that the phrase \u201cwhilst running,\u201d &c., applies to and qualifies not the S.S. Baltic itself but only some of the property and articles intended to be included in the risk. The third interpretation is that by the words in question the companies undertook to insure not a vessel laid up during the season of navigation but a vessel actively engaged or employed during that period upon the inland lakes, rivers or canals\u2014that during the season of navigation she must be a vessel in use or as they say \u201cin commission,\u201d (a term only applicable to national ships of war)\u2014with the necessary ship\u2019s papers and properly provided with master, crew and everything requisite for the ordinary prosecution of the business of a merchant vessel.\nI am not able to agree with the view of the learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division. It is true that the word \u201cinland\u201d is an emphatic word confining the risk so far as locality is concerned to inland lakes, rivers and canals, so that if a loss should occur while the vessel happened to be, say at Halifax or any other Atlantic port or on the high seas, she would not be covered But there are, it seems to me, other equally emphatic words and one of these words is \u201crunning\u201d The learned Chief Justice\u2019s interpretation gives no effect to it. But not only that; it necessarily introduces into the clause an idea which is opposed to the idea conveyed by the word \u201crunning,\u201d namely, the idea that whether the ship was \u201crunning,\u201d that is, in active employment or use, or whether she was laid up either at anchor or in dock or upon dry land, she was still within the words of the policy. This, I think, is not interpreting the contract but enlarging it, making a contract not contemplated by the parties. I have not been able to appreciate the second interpretation given to this clause to which I have referred. It is a clause qualifying either the word \u201cBaltic,\u201d or the word \u201csteamer.\u201d It contemplates not engines, anchors, office furniture, etc., running, but a steamer running, nothing more, nothing less.\nThe third interpretation is, I think, the correct one. It is an element of importance that this is a fire policy, not a marine policy. Two elements much more important in a fire policy than in a marine policy are those of locality and mode of use. The risk of a thing being burned depends not so much upon the thing itself as upon its location and the uses to which it is put. A wooden building used for the manufacture of dynamite in a crowded city surrounded by factories continually emitting sparks from their chimneys or smokestacks may be absolutely uninsurable. The same structure removed for farming purposes to the open prairie might be insured at almost a nominal sum. Now this is not a \u201ctime\u201d policy. A time policy is a phrase used only in marine insurance to distinguish it from a voyage policy. It in no material respect differs from a policy upon a building or upon anything else capable of insurance against fire. Neither is it a policy insuring the subject matter from one definite period to another. It is rather a policy insuring it during such periods within two defined points of time as she may happen to come within the description and terms of the risk. In the present case she is insured, first, whilst running upon the inland lakes, rivers and canals during the season of navigation, and secondly, whilst she is laid up in a place of safety during winter months (removed) from any extra-hazardous building. There may be within the year many periods, longer or shorter, in which she is not covered at all. She may during the season of navigation be running on the high seas. Whilst so occupied she is not insured. So likewise during the winter months she may be running either on the high seas or upon the unfrozen waters of the inland lakes, or as at the City of Quebec engaged as a ferry boat from one side of the St. Lawrence to the other. Still she is not insured. I do not know and it is not material to determine to what extent the element of locality influenced the insurance companies in making these policies. I do not know whether navigation upon salt water is carried on at a greater risk than on fresh water or why the operations of this steamer were confined to the latter, but admitting that the parties in limiting the operations of the vessel to inland waters had in view the prohibition of navigation in ocean waters, it is perfectly clear that they had also in contemplation two distinct classes of risk, namely, the risk of fire whilst she was in actual use during the season of navigation and likewise the risk of fire whilst she was not in use but laid up in a place of safety during the winter months. The mode of use in both cases was material to the risk. In the summer months no special provision was made for her safety Then she would be running. She would have her master and crew; she would have her life saving and fire saving apparatus; she would be under constant supervision and the danger of fire would be reduced to a minimum. In the winter months, however, she must be laid up. She may be laid up anywhere, whether in an inland port or an ocean port, but wherever laid up it must be in a place of safety and removed from an extra hazardous building. Looking at the whole clause it seems to me that the words \u201crunning during the season of navigation\u201d are mainly used in contrast with the words \u201claid up during the winter months.\u201d She is only covered by the clause whilst during the season of navigation she is running and whilst during the winter months she is laid up in a place of safety. This, it seems to me, is the true construction of the clause. It gives a natural and reasonable meaning to each of its words and it does not necessitate as the first interpretation does the insertion of the additional stipulation to which I have referred in order to give effect to it. If the view I take is incorrect and the first interpretation is the right one; if it is not necessary that during the season of navigation the vessel should be in actual use; if all that was contemplated by the parties was that during that season the vessel should exist in situ whether running or laid up, then she might be laid up anywhere, whether in a place of safety or not; she might be anchored or even let run adrift upon the open lakes; she might be moored or hauled up high and dry in immediate proximity to any factory or building no matter how dangerous such proximity might be. Surely, as I view it, this consideration alone shews the untenable character of the ground upon which the judgment below is based.\nOne other point remains. It is contended that the stipulation contained in the words \u201cwhilst running,\u201d &c., is a condition within the meaning of the Ontario Insurance Act, and inasmuch as it varies from or is in addition to the conditions by that Act made statutory, the policy should comply with section 115 of the Act which provides that such variations or additions should be printed in conspicuous type and in ink of different colour. So far as this point is concerned I entirely agree with the view taken by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal and Mr. Justice Osler. The stipulation in question is in no sense a condition but rather a description of the subject matter insured. It is descriptive of and has reference solely to the risk covered by the policy and not to the happening of an event which by the statutory conditions would render the policy void. The statute, therefore, does not apply.\nOn the whole I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed; all costs to follow in the usual course.\nAppeal allowed with costs.[8]\nSolicitors for the appellant: Beaty, Blackstock, Nesbitt, Chadwick & Riddell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin & Creelman.\n[1] 25 Ont.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal (25 Ont. App. R. 326) affirmed,\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Rose at the trial.\nThe appeal in this case involves a single question of law as to the construction of a will, namely, who would take by a devise to heirs under the Act 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 6, abolishing primogeniture in Ontario. The nature of the contentions of the respective parties are stated in the judgment of the court.\nO\u2019Gara Q.C. and Wyld for the appellant, relied on Tylee v. Deal[2], and Baldwin v. Kingstone[3].\nA.E. Fripp for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014George Sparks, in his lifetime of the Township of Gloucester, in the Province of Ontario, departed this life in the month of November, 1867, having first duly made his last will and testament in writing bearing date the 15th day of October, 1867, whereby among other things, he devised certain real property in the will mentioned situate in the said Township of Gloucester, to his wife Sarah Sparks, for the term of her natural life, or until she should marry again, and upon her decease or marrying again, he gave and devised the said property to his son Frederick Sparks, if he should be living at the happening of either of the said contingencies, and to his heirs and assigns forever. And if the said Frederick Sparks should not be living when either of the said contingencies should happen, then he gave and devised the same property unto the heirs of the said Frederick Sparks, their heirs and assigns forever. Frederick died unmarried in 1882, in the lifetime of the devisee for life, who died in 1887, without having married again. The sole question is, who upon the decease of the tenant for life became entitled to the property under the above devise to \u201cthe heirs of the said Frederick Sparks, their heirs and assigns forever\u201d? The plaintiff claims that it passed to all the brothers and sisters of Frederick, of whom there were several, and of whom the plaintiff is one and the defendant another, while on the contrary the defendant, the now appellant, claims that it passed to Abraham Sparks alone as being the eldest brother of Frederick and who was his heir if 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 6 of the statutes of the late Province of Canada had never been passed, by title derived from whom the plaintiff claims. The contention of the defendant is that the words in the will \u201cthe heirs of the said Frederick Sparks\u201d in the event which has happened must by force of the 19th section of the above Act be construed to be the person who would have been the heir-at-law of Frederick if that statute had never been passed. This contention, if sound, involves the necessity of construing the 19th section of the Act as putting a legislative and therefore a peremptory interpretation on the word \u201cheirs\u201d wherever occurring in a devise of real property, and so equally when occurring in a deed, for the words of the section are, \u201cnor shall the same effect any limitation of any estate by deed or will,\u201d but there is not an expression in the Act which warrants a surmise that the legislature entertained any idea of putting a legislative interpretation upon the word \u201cheir\u201d or \u201cheirs\u201d when occurring either in a will or in a deed. The interpretation of those instruments is unaffected by the Act which deals not with their interpretation at all; that is left to the rules of law established for the purpose, namely, that the intention of the testator or grantor is to be ascertained from the language used by him, such language being construed in its ordinary acceptation unless there be something to show that a special technical signification was intended. The Act provides for a wholly different purpose, namely, the purpose of abolishing the right of primogeniture in the succession of real estate held in fee simple or for the life of another. This is the only matter with which it professes to deal. The statute in its sections numbered from 1 to 18 inclusively, prescribes how after the 1st day of January, 1852, real estate which a person shall die seized of, for an estate in fee simple, or for the life of another without having lawfully devised the same shall descend or pass by way of succession. Then follows the 19th section which enacts ex abundanti cautel\u00e2, 1st, that the estate of a husband as tenant by the curtesy, or of a widow as tenant in dower shall not be affected by any of the provisions of the Act, nor, 2ndly, shall the same affect any limitation of any estate by deed or will; nor, 3rdly, any estate which although in fee simple or for the life of another is so held in trust for any other person, but all such estates shall remain, pass, and descend as if this Act had not been passed. It is not very clear to my mind what the precise object and intent of the draftsman was in inserting in this 19th section the sentence that the provisions of the Act \u201cshall not affect any limitation of any estate by deed or will.\u201d What is said shall not be affected by any of the provisions of the Act is \u201cany limitation\u201d of any estate by deed or will. Now the expression \u201climitation\u201d of an estate is a word used for determining how long estates conveyed by deed or will shall last\u2014for limiting the duration of such estates. Thus, if real property be conveyed by deed or will to A. for life, then to B. in tail male, with remainder to C. in fee simple, the instrument passing such estates contains limitations of, 1st, an estate for life, 2ndly, an estate in fee tail, and, 3rdly, an estate in fee simple. Now how the fact of the estate in fee simple upon the decease of the tenant thereof intestate passing to several persons as his heirs instead of to one person as sole heir could be said to \u201caffect the limitation\u201d of the estates conveyed by the deed or will, I do not, I confess, clearly perceive. The \u201climitations\u201d of the estates as expressed in the deed or will would remain the same, namely, for life, in fee tail, and in fee simple, whether those to take in succession to the tenant in fee simple or on his dying intestate should consist of many or of one person only.\nI rather incline to think that the expression was used without full consideration of its aptness, and that what was intended was to leave limitations of estates by deed or will then existing under the operation of 4 Wm. IV. ch. 1, which deals with such estates, and the words \u201cthat all such estates shall remain, etc., etc,\u201d as pointing to something then having existence seems to me to support this view. But whatever may have been the precise object and intent of the expression used we can, I think, confidently assert that it does not say, nor can it be construed as saying, that all estates in fee simple or for the life of another whether created by a deed or a will already executed or which should at any time be created by any deed or will to be at any time thereafter executed, and of which any person should at any time die seized and intestate should descend to the common law heir of such person, and that those only which a deceased intestate had inherited should pass by way of succession under 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 6. If such should be held to be the law then an estate which in one generation should pass under the provisions of the Act might in a subsequent generation, a deed or will intervening, bring the property back to the old common law heir and thus complicate the law of succession to real property and defeat the main object of 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 6 which was to abolish primogeniture. However all that we are at present concerned with is to determine who are the parties to whom the testator has devised the land in question under the designation of the heirs of Frederick Sparks and their heirs and assigns forever.\nThe will was made in the Province of Ontario relating to property situate therein and fifteen years after the coming into operation of the Act 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 6. At that time the words \u201cheirs of Frederick Sparks\u201d in their ordinary acceptation denoted the persons who by the laws of the Province of Ontario would have succeeded to such real property, if any, as Frederick Sparks died seized of and intestate. Such being the ordinary acceptation of the terms used we must hold that the testator used them in that sense in the absence of anything to show a contrary or different intent. The Court of Appeal for Ontario in so holding have followed the case of Tylee v. Deal[4], and Baldwin v. Kingstone[5], where similar words in wills made before the passing of the Act were held to mean the heir at common law for the same reason and upon the application of the same rule of construction of wills as in the present case necessitates the same words to mean the statutory heirs.\nIt was argued that the Ontario statute, 43 Vict. ch. 14 s. 2, passed on the 5th March, 1880, amounts to a statutory declaration that up to the passing of that Act the word \u201cheirs\u201d in a will meant the heirs at common law. The following is the section:\n2. Where any real estate is devised by any testator dying after the passing of this Act to the heir or heirs of such testator or of any other person and no contrary or other intention is signified by the will the words \u201cheir\u201d or \u201cheirs,\u201d shall be construed to mean the person or persons to whom such real property would descend under the law of Ontario in case of intestacy.\nThat section expresses an accurate enunciation of the result of the rule of law applicable independently of the statute to the construction of a will made subsequently to the passing of 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 6 in the Province of Ontario, in relation to property situate therein; but the section seems to go further and to apply that rule to all wills wherever or whenever made affecting property in Ontario, provided only that the testator should die after the passing of the Act. Consequently if a case similar to Tylee v. Deal[6], in which the will was not only made before the passing of 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 6, but in England, or similar to Baldwin v. Kingstone[7], where the will was made in Canada, but before the passing of the Act, should again arise, if only the testator should die after the passing of 43 Vict. ch. 14, it would seem to be necessary in compli- ance with 43 Vict. ch. 14 to hold that the word \u201cheirs\u201d as used in these wills meant the statutory heirs and not the common law heirs. That statute gives a legislative interpretation of the word \u201cheirs\u201d which the statute 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 6 did not do or purport to do.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: O\u2019Gara, Wylde & Gemmill.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.E.

A former action between the same parties was brought to enforce an agreement for the supply of gas to the plaintiff embodied in a deed executed on April 20th, 1891. In that action the plaintiff claimed the benefit of a reservation in an agreement entered on April 6th, but failed to secure it, the courts holding that only the deed could be looked to and that did not contain such reservation[1]. The plaintiff then brought an action to reform the deed by incorporating the reservation therewith and recovered judgment on the trial before Armour C.J. That judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal which held that the question was res judicata by the judgment in the previous action, and that no notice of the error had been brought home to the defendants. Burton C.J.O. dissenting in the Court of Appeal, held that the evidence was sufficient to charge defendants with notice. The plaintiffs appealed to this court.\nAylesworth Q.C. for the appellants.

The judgment there given contains a full statement of the facts and of the questions arising between the parties in that action which related to the construction of the deed of the 20th of April, 1891, there stated, and referred to a reservation in favour of the present appellants contained in a preceding executory agreement of the 6th of April, the question being whether that reservation was to be considered as still in force or was to be treated as having been superseded by the later deed. In that action as is observed in the judgment no case for rectification of the deed was made. The present action has been brought for the purpose of having the deed in question reformed by the insertion of the reservation referred to. The cause was tried before the Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division who gave judgment for the appellants directing the rectification asked for. On appeal this judgment was reversed by a majority of the Court of Appeal (Osler and Maclennan JJ.), the Chief Justice dissenting. This latter judgment proceeded upon two grounds; first, the question was considered to be res judicata having, as it was held, been concluded by the judgment in the former action; secondly, it was considered that no notice of the error had been brought home to the respondents, The Provincial Natural Gas & Fuel Co. of Ontario, and that that company were therefore bon\u00e2 fide purchasers for value without notice.\nNo case for rectification having been made by the first action, as was there most distinctly held, it is impossible upon any recognised principle applicable to the defence of res judicata to hold that such an answer to the action can be maintained. I need not go fully into that question as we all agree entirely in the judgment of the Chief Justice of Ontario on that head. It is not material to say that the appellants might, if they had so elected, have made an alternative case for relief on the ground of mistake in their first action; it is sufficient to say that they did not in fact do so and that no such question was there in issue.\nUpon the second point, that of notice, we agree with what is said in the judgments delivered by both the learned Chief Justices who decided in the appellants\u2019 favour, and we adopt in their entirety the observations on that part of the case made in the dissenting judgment delivered in the Court of Appeal.\nAs to the right to recover damages in an action for rectification, I see no objection to it. It was formerly held that a party could not have a decree for specific performance in the suit for rectification, that is specific performance of the agreement as altered by the decree, but no sound reason was ever given for this doctrine and it is no longer law.

The curator of the estate brought an action in the Superior Court of Quebec to compel him to do so and obtained judgment whereupon he accepted delivery and paid the purchase money. The curator subsequently brought another action in Ontario for special damages alleged to have been incurred in the care and preservation of the assets from the time of the purchase until the delivery.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that under the law of Quebec, by which the case was governed, the curator was entitled to recover the expenses and disbursements which, as a prudent administrator, he was obliged to make for the safe\u2011keeping of the property.\nHeld also, that these special damages, most of which could not be ascertained until after the purchase was completed, could not have been included in the action brought in the Quebec courts and the right to recover them was not res judicata by the judgment in that action.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThis appeal involves the decision of two questions of law which, with the facts from which they arose, are sufficiently stated in the above head-note and in the judgment of the court. The Court of Appeal for Ontario did not deal with the question of res judicata as it held that the plaintiff had no right of action.\nBelcourt for the appellant.\nAylesworth Q.C. and Pratt for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGIROUARD J.\u2014This is an Ontario appeal, but the merits of the case are to be determined by the laws of the Province of Quebec. On the 9th day of April, 1896, in the City of Hull, in the Province of Quebec, the respondent purchased for cash from the appellant, as curator to the insolvent estate of one F.X. Martin, merchant, of Hull, the stock in trade and all the assets abandoned by the said F.X. Martin, for the benefit of his creditors, but a short time afterwards he repudiated the sale and refused to take the goods. In consequence of this refusal, on the 21st April, 1896, the respondent was put in default and protested and finally sued. It was not till the 18th of March, 1897, that, in satisfaction of a judgment of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec against him, he took possession and paid the balance of the purchase money, amounting to $11,712.57, together with the interest thereon from the date of service of process and costs of suit.\nNow the appellant demands from the respondent the further sum of $953.63, as special damages which his default has caused to the creditors of the said estate.\nThe respondent pleaded res judicata, alleging that he had satisfied the judgment rendered against him, in principal and damages, the latter consisting in the interest on the balance of the purchase money and all the costs, and as stated in his plea, he contends that the claim of the plaintiff sued for in this action is one which the plaintiff included or might and ought to have included in his claim in said action in the Superior Court, in the Province of Quebec.\nWhatever may be the meaning of res judicata under the laws of Ontario, there is no possible doubt that under the laws of Quebec the Quebec judgment is not res judicata of the present claim. The payment of the interest and costs means that and nothing more; C.C. Arts. 1077, 1534; it does not mean other damages resulting from the default in accepting delivery of goods, such as insurance, care-taking, etc., which are specially excluded and reserved by the declaration in the former suit,\nthe plaintiff, \u00eas qualit\u00e9, reserving to himself all rights to claim from the defendant all damages, costs, expenses, caused by the defendant\u2019s default.\nArt. 1065 of the Civil Code of Quebec says:\nEvery obligation renders the debtor liable in damages in case of a breach of it on his part.\nArt. 1071:\nThe debtor is liable to pay damages in all cases in which he fails to establish that the inexecution of the obligation proceeds from a cause which cannot be imputed to him, although there be no bad faith on his part.\nArticle 1073:\nDamages due to the creditor are in general the amount of the loss that he has sustained and of the profit of which he was deprived.\nThe loss here consisted not only in the loss of the purchase money for a time, but also the cost of keeping the property in dispute. The appellant could not include the damages which he now claims in the Quebec suit, either in the principal action or by an incidental demand. Some had happened before the institution of the suit, but the greatest part were in the future and could not be ascertained when the case was instituted or argued, less when it was decided. In fact these damages could not be ascertained before the default had ceased de facto, that is before the pay- ment of the full amount of the purchase money, on the 18th of March, 1897. They are necessary expenses and disbursements which the curator and the creditors had to incur pending the default of the respondent, which might have been of several years if the respondent had resorted to the appellate courts of the country. He wisely submitted to the judgment of the first court; he is nevertheless responsible for all the damages caused by his default. C.C. Arts 1065, 1067, 1069, 1070, 1071, 1073, 1074.\nThe respondent contends that he never authorized these expenses. This is perfectly true. The appellant was not his agent; he was not even a negotiorum gestor under article 1043 and following of the Civil Code; he was simply a curator of an insolvent estate; and it is only in that capacity that he can succeed.\nNow, what is the legal position of such a curator? What are his duties, obligations and powers? They are defined in article 771 of the Code of Civil Procedure in force when this matter was pending:\nThe curator takes possession of all the property mentioned in the statement (of abandonment) and administers it until it is sold in the manner hereinafter mentioned.\nThe curator is therefore in possession and an administrator, and his administration ends only when the property is sold in the manner indicated by the Code, that is, if for cash, till the cash is paid.\nAs an administrator, was the appellant justified in making the claim he has preferred? Mr. Justice Moss has very accurately and concisely summarized its particulars, and I cannot do better than reproduce his observations:\nThe claim made in this action is in respect of four different classes of items:\n(1.) At the date of the abandonment by Martin the property was insured in certain insurance companies under policies in respect of which Martin had paid premiums to a period far beyond the 11th of April, 1896, the date of the defendant\u2019s purchase. These policies were allowed to continue until they expired, instead of being put an end to, and a return secured of a proportionate part of the premiums as would have been done if the defendant had fulfilled his contract according to its terms. The plaintiff claims the proportion of these premiums, amounting to $164.77.\n(2.) When some of these policies expired after the sale to the defendant, short term risks were effected and premiums were paid out of the moneys of the estate in respect of them. These are claimed and amount to $42.60.\n(3.) Certain disbursements were made out of the moneys of the estate for the care and feed of some horses forming part of the property sold, for coals supplied to heat the shop where the stock of goods was, and for men carrying some of the goods upstairs and removing ice from the basement of the shop. These are claimed and amount to $60.25.\n(4.) A person named Mutchmore was directed by the plaintiff to look after the stock of goods, and he visited the place once, and occasionally twice a day, lit fires in the winter months, turned over the goods, packed away furs, and otherwise cared for the property until the defendant took it away. For this he had not been paid at the time of the trial, but in respect of these services and of the plaintiff\u2019s supervision a claim is made of $686.00.\nI would, however, add to the word \u201csupervision\u201d in the last line of the item, the words \u201cand responsibility.\u201d\nAll these expenses and disbursements were made in the safe keeping of the property in question. Can it be pretended seriously that a prudent administrator, for instance, a tutor or an executor, or a trustee, is not in duty bound to keep the property entrusted to his care and administration insured against accidents by fire? Is the appellant to be less careful than the insolvent who kept the same property insured while in his possession? Is he not justified in keeping a caretaker or guardian of an estate worth nearly $13,000? He had one before the sale, as is the practice pending the liquidation of insolvent estates. Why not one also after the sale, till the payment of the purchase money and the delivery according to the terms of the sale? Why not one till the property is removed from the curator\u2019s hands? Is he to continue to discharge his duties and obligations for another year or more for nothing? I think all the classes of items contained in the bill of particulars, except the first, should be allowed, not because they were incurred in the interest and for the benefit of the respondent, but because they were the necessary consequence of his default, in the interest of the creditors. The creditors are responsible to the curator for the amount of the damage he claims, and it is only just that they be refunded or indemnified by the wrong doer. The respondent is clearly liable.\nThe first class of items, composed of insurance premiums paid by the insolvent before the abandonment, cannot be entertained, because the respondent not only bought the stock in trade, but also all the assets of the insolvent, and this item was certainly one of his assets.\nWe are therefore of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs before all the courts and that this action be referred to William L. Scott, Esquire, one of the masters of the High Court of Justice of Ontario, at Ottawa, to take an account of the amount reasonably and properly paid or incurred by appellant as such curator in respect of the above items 2, 3 and 4, in respect of insurance upon the stock in trade and fixtures of the said estate from the 21st of April, 1896, date of the default, to the 18th of March, 1897, date of the payment and delivery, and also in respect of the care and guardianship of the said property during the above period, including the curator\u2019s fees or remuneration, and those of his guardian, and generally all the items of the bill of particulars filed, excluding only said item no. 1 in respect of insurance premiums paid by the insolvent previous to the assignment.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Belcourt & Ritchie.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Pratt & Pratt.\n"}

There were two subsequent clauses providing respectively that until such proofs were produced, no money should be payable by the insurer and for forfeiture of all rights of the insured if the claim should not, for the space of three months after the occurrence of the fire, be in all respects verified in the manner aforesaid.\nHeld, that the condition as to the production of proofs within fourteen days was a condition precedent to the liability of the insurer; that the force of the word \"until\" in the subsequent clause could not give to the omission to produce such proofs, within the time specified, the effect of postponing recovery merely until after their production, and that the clause as to forfeiture after three months did not apply to the conditions specially required to be fulfilled within any lesser period.\nNeither the local agent for soliciting risks nor an adjuster sent for the purpose of investigating the loss under a policy of fire insurance, has authority to waive compliance with conditions precedent to the insurer's liability or to extend the time thereby limited for their fulfilment, and as the policy in question specially required it, there could be no waiver unless by indorsement in writing upon the policy signed as therein specified. Atlas Assurance Co. v. Brownell (29 Can. S. C. R. 537) followed. Appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] refusing the defendant's application to have the judgment entered for the plaintiffs set aside and the action dismissed, or for a new trial.\nThe facts of the case and questions at issue on this appeal sufficiently appear from the statement given in the judgment of the court delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice King.\nDrysdale Q.C. for the appellant. It was a condition precedent that assured, within fourteen days after the loss, should deliver a particular statement and account of the loss; no attempt was made to comply with this requirement until at least thirty-seven days after the fire. There could be no waiver except by indorsement upon the policy signed by the agents of the company at Halifax; there was no waiver in the manner provided, and waiver is out of the question in the action. The findings of the jury do not aid the plaintiffs, and under the contract they are irrelevant and notwithstanding such findings, the appellant is entitled to judgment. The finding that the delay in respect to the proofs were reasonable, has nothing to do with the position of the parties under the contract. The finding that the adjuster knowingly caused Margeson, to believe up to a period later than fourteen days after the fire, that it was not necessary to prepare proofs of loss, does not contain the elements of estoppel, as there is no finding that acting or relying upon such belief and by reason thereof he failed to put in his proofs. The finding that Margeson, after the fourteen days had expired, proceeded with diligence in the preparation of proofs, is immaterial. There was no evidence to warrant any suggestion or finding of waiver by, or estoppel as against, the company in connection with condition 14. The adjuster had no authority to bind the company, he was not an officer of the company having authority to waive conditions in the policy; Logan v. Commercial Union Insurance Co.[2]; Western Assurance Co. v. Doull[3]; Caldwell v. The Stadacona Fire and Life Ins. Co.[4]; Employers Liability Assurance Corporation v. Taylor[5]; Atlas v. Brownell[6], and cases there cited.\nBorden Q. C. for the respondents. The company prevented the making of proofs and cannot set up the delay as a defence to plaintiffs' claim. The law does not require performance if it has been prevented by the person sought to be fixed with liability. Edwards v. Aberayron Mut. Ship Ins. Soc.[7], at p. 580; Leake on Contracts (3 ed.) pp. 379, 380; Hotham v. East India Co.[8]; Goldstone v. Osborn[9]; Tredwen v. Holman[10]; Thomas v. Fredricks[11]. Refusal by the insurer to appoint an appraiser or a denial of liability under the policy relieves the insured. Uhrig v. Williamsburgh City Fire Ins. Co.[12]; Phoenix Ins. Co. v. Stocks[13]; 4 Joyce on Insurance; secs. 3255, 3257 and cases there cited; 2 May on Insurance (3 ed.) sec. 496 b.; 1 Hudson, Building Contracts, 321, 327, 330; Mackay v. Dick[14]; Roberts v. Bury Commissioners[15], at pp. 320, 326 and 330.\nThe non-delivery of proofs within fourteen days did not occasion a forfeiture of plaintiffs' rights under the policy the only provision for such a forfeiture being that \"if the claim shall not for the space of three months after the occurrence of the fire be in all respects verified, in manner aforesaid, the insured shall forfeit every right to restitution or payment by virtue of this policy and time shall be the essence of the contract.\" The plaintiffs refer to Lafarge v. Liverpool, London & Globe Ins. Co.[16]; Hutchinson v. Niagara District Mut. Fire Ins. Co.[17]; Weir v. Northern Counties of England Ins. Co.[18]; 2 Beach on Insurance, sec. 1203, 1210; 2 May on Insurance, (3 ed.) sec. 465; 4 Joyce on Insurance, sec. 3282 and cases cited. In the fourteenth condition the following provision is found, after the provision requring proofs of loss: \"And until such accounts, etc., are produced * * * \"no money shall be payable under this policy.\" Upon a reasonable construction of this provision in connection with that requiring proofs within 14 days and that creating a forfeiture if the proofs are not delivered within three months, the delivery of proofs within 14 days cannot be a condition precedent, otherwise the provision just quoted, as well as that creating a forfeiture, would be unnecessary, inconsistent and useless.\nIf the delivery of proofs of loss within 14 days is a condition precedent, the defendant is estopped from setting it up. The findings are conclusive on this point. The company induced plaintiff to refrain from preparing proofs of loss, promised that its adjuster should prepare the necessary proofs, and sent him to plaintiffs for that, among other purposes. It is significant both as to the adjuster's authority and as to his intention that upon his second visit he took blank proofs of loss with him; forms supplied by the company suited to the conditions of its own policy. See Western Assur. Co. v. Doull[19] per Strong J. at p. 456; Jennings v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.[20] at p. 65; Goodwin v. Roberts[21]; Indiana Insurance Co. v. Capehart[22]; Heath v.

Co.[26]; 2 May on Insurance, (3 ed.) secs. 497, 498, 499. The nineteenth condition requiring indorsement of waiver does not apply to waiver of the provisions relating to appraisal or to proofs of loss; Blake v. Exchange Mutual Ins. Co. of Philadelphia[27]; 1 Joyce on Insurance, sec. 437, and the cases cited, and May on Insurance (3 ed.) sec. 511.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nKING J.\u2014This is an appeal by defendants from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in an action on a policy of insurance against fire upon a stock of merchandise In the clause of the policy binding the company to pay the amount of a loss, it is expressed that the obligation shall be subject to the conditions and stipulations indorsed on the policy.\nBy the 14th of such conditions and stipulations, persons sustaining loss or damage are forthwith to give notice thereof in writing at the office of the company at Halifax or to the local agent, and are, within fourteen days after the loss, to deliver in writing in duplicate a particular statement and account of their loss or damage, specifying a number of particulars, and also stating when and how the fire originated as far as the insured may know or believe. It is further required that the insured shall verify such statement and account by the production of books of account and vouchers and by his affidavit, and when practicable by the testimony of domestics, servants or clerks. He is further required to procure a certificate of two magistrates most contiguous to the place of the fire, stating their belief that the loss was an honest one, and, if required, he is to submit to an oral examination under oath as to the loss and his claim; and is (amongst other things) also to supply such other vouchers and produce such further evidence and give such other explanation as the company may reasonably require to prove his account of the loss or damage and of his right to recover the amount claimed. It is then stipulated that\nuntil such accounts, declaration, testimony, vouchers and evidence as aforesaid are produced and examination (if required) and such explanation given no money shall be payable by the company under this policy. * * And if the claim shall not, for the space of three months after the occurrence of the fire be in all respects verified in manner aforesaid the insured shall forfeit every right to restitution or payment by virtue of this policy, and time shall be of the essence of the contract.\nBy the 16th condition it is declared that\npayment of losses shall be made within sixty days after the loss shall have been ascertained and proved in accordance with these conditions.,\nThe fire occurred on the 22nd day of February, 1897. Notice in writing was forthwith given by the assured, in a formal way that showed that he was acting under the condition of the policy; but no statement or account of loss was furnished withing the fourteen days, nor was it furnished until about thirty-seven days after the fire.\nIn reply to the defence of the company setting up this breach of condition, the insured claims that the company are estopped from availing themselves of such defence upon the alleged ground that he was induced to delay making the statement and proof through the action and representations of the local agent of the company and of their adjuster. Upon findings of the jury to this effect, the court below affirmed a judgment of the trial judge entered for the plaintiffs.\nIn the course of his argument for the respondent,( Mr. Borden contended that the requirement of the contract as to the furnishing of statement of loss, etc., within fourteen days, is not a condition precedent to recovery.\nThe question whether stipulations are to be held to be dependent or independent is to be determinedly the intention of the parties as it appears on the instrument, and by the application of common sense to each particular case; to which intention, when once discovered, all technical forms of expression are to give way. Stavers v. Curling[28].\nWhere, from a consideration of the whole instrument, it appears that the one party relied upon his remedy and not upon performance of the condition by the other, the performance is not a condition precedent; but where it appears that the intention most probably was to rely substantially upon the performance of the condition rather than upon a remedy in damages for its breach, then the reasonable view is that performance is a condition precedent. Roberts v. Brett[29].\nLooking at the nature of the requirement here, and the close connection between its performance and the principal obligation of the company, it does not seem at all likely that the company was stipulating for an independent advantage, or intending to rely on what in any event must prove a barren remedy. The more reasonable construction is that performance was meant to be a condition of the obligation which in the body of the policy was expressly stated to be subject to it; not that these latter words would of themselves suffice to make of a stipulation a condition precedent, unless upon consideration of the whole contract such appears to be its effect.\nTwo clauses are, however, relied upon by the respondent. One, already cited, is that\nuntil such accounts, declaration, testimony, vouchers and evidence, etc., are produced, no money shall be payable by the company under this policy;\nand it was contended that by force of the word \"until,\" as distinguished from \"unless,\" the effect of an omission to give the particular statement or account within the fourteen days is merely that recovery is postponed until it is given, citing Weir v. Northern Counties Ass. Co.[30]. It was pointed out by Mr. Drysdale that it was there stipulated that in default of the proofs no action should lie \"until\" etc. In Whyte v. Western Ass. Co.[31], the Judicial Committee held that a clause requiring proofs to be made within a prescribed time was a condition precedent to recovery in a contract where a subsequent clause restrained recovery until proofs made. In point of construction the clause relied upon by respondent is a general one covering a number of things variously dealt with by the preceding clauses, and makes their performance in the way previously indicated a condition precedent to the company's liability. If the word \"accounts\" as used in it includes the statement or account in question, there is nothing in the general words which purports to render the particular provision as to its production within fourteen days wholly useless and superfluous.\nThe other clause relied on is this, that\nif the claim shall not for the space of three months after the occurrence of the fire be in all respects verified in manner aforesaid, the insured shall forfeit every right to restitution or payment by virtue of this policy and time shall be of the essence of the contract. This does not mean that the three months are given for the performance of any act of proof whatever, but that all that is required to be done in the way of verifying the claim shall be done within the three months. Proof required to be given within a lesser prescribed time is to be so given; and, as to things in respect of which no time is specifically fixed, these also are to be done within the three months, so as that, within such time, everything in the way of verifying and perfecting the claim shall be then completed.\nThe 16th condition declaring that\npayment of losses shall be made within sixty days after the loss shall have been ascertained and proved in accordance with these conditions\nclearly makes the giving of the proofs in accordance with the conditions a condition precedent to the liability of the company, and leaves the only question to be one as to the construction of the terms of the condition precedent. If the giving of the principal statement or account is a condition precedent, the giving of it within the fourteen days is equally so. See also Mason v. Harvey[32]; Roper v. Lendon[33]; Employers Liability Assurance Corporation v. Taylor[34].\nNext as to the alleged estoppel. The plaintiff says that after the fire he had a conversation with a local agent as to what was to be done, and that the latter said\nto keep quiet until the adjusters arrived, that nothing could be done until they arrived.\nUpon receiving notice of the loss the company sent their adjuster, Mr. Butcher, to the spot. He reached the plaintiffs' on February 25th.\nCondition 15 provides that\nwhere merchandise or other personal property is partially damaged, the insured shall forthwith cause it to be put in as good order as the nature of the case will admit assorting and arranging the various articles according to their kinds, and shall cause a list or inventory of the whole to be made naming the quantity and cost of each kind. The damage shall then be ascertained by the examination and appraisal of said damage on each article by disinterested appraisers mutually agreed upon whose detailed report in writing shall form part of the proofs required to be furnished by the insured.\nThese proofs are not part of the particular statement or account required to be furnished within fourteen days after the fire.\nButcher first set about getting the articles sorted out so as to expedite the work of appraisal. The plaintiff says:\nThe morning Mr. Butcher arrived he said he wanted the goods all arranged so that they could list them. He wanted to go back that week. He said the company always paid losses in full and expected to pay mine. * * * After that I proceeded with the sorting of the goods. I had not got through when Mr. Butcher went away on Saturday. Before he went away he said that when the goods were assorted and listed he would return and make out the proofs of loss. He wished me to let the local agents know when we got through. I got through the following Thursday or Friday, and I then notified the local agent. * * * After I gave the notice to the local agent, Mr. Butcher returned the first of the following week. That would be a fortnight from the day of the fire. * * * That time he remained three days, I think. During that time he examined the goods and made out a list. When he got through with making out the list he did not come to see me or give me a copy of it. He went away without showing me the list.\nQ. (By plaintiffs' counsel) Tell me why it was\u2014I am speaking of the second time Butcher went away\u2014why it was that before that you had not got the proofs of loss completed and put in?\u2014A. I thought Mr. Butcher came there for the purpose of helping to make up the proofs of loss. I did not do so because they had a list of the goods and I thought the proofs of loss could be made up from the appraisement they were making.\nMr. Butcher denies that he said that he would make out proofs of loss, but he admits that if he could have got the prices arranged (which according to him was prevented by plaintiff,) he would have made out the proofs of loss and sent them to the company.\nOn leaving Kentville on the first occasion he wrote the following letter to plaintiff, dated 26th February:\nIn confirmation of my verbal instructions of this morning, I require you to conform to the conditions printed in your policy with the Commercial Union Assurance Co. When your stock is ready for appraisement please notify Mr. Roscoe, agent here at Kentville.\nThe plaintiff says that after receiving this letter he looked over the conditions of the policy, and that sometime during the week following the fire (which occurred on Monday) he consulted a Mr. Shaffner about making out proofs of loss; and he further says\nIt was about the time I got Butcher's letter that I went to Shaffner. I could not say whether it was before or after. I did not take the policy to him. I read the conditions all over at that time. I knew very little about proofs of loss before reading these. I knew that they were required. I had a slight idea of that from the first. I always supposed I would have to prove the loss. I had a discussion with the adjusters about the appraisement, not about the proof, on their first visit.\nThe following question (amongst others) was left to the jury:\nDid the acts and words of the local agent and adjuster of the defendant company before the adjusters left Kentville the first time, reasonably cause the failure of plaintiff to deliver proofs of loss before March 31, 1897? If so, state in detail what were such acts and words.\nAnd the jury answered:\nYes. The local agent informed plaintiff to keep quiet until adjuster arrived, that nothing could be done until then. That plaintiff was told by Butcher that he would make up proofs of loss on his return.\nAssuming that Butcher's letter of 26th February primarily referred to the assorting of the goods, it contains a clear intimation to the insured that he is to look to his contract and comply with its conditions. And that he so understood it himself is clear, for he thereupon read the conditions all over and appears to have consulted a Mr. Shaffner about making out proofs of loss. It is idle, therefore, for the plaintiff to say that the reason he did not make out the proofs of loss was because he thought that Butcher had come for the purpose of helping to make out such proofs (supposing that this is a sufficient reason.) Again, and as an alternative answer to the question of his counsel as to why he did not make out the proofs of loss, he says:\nI did not do so because they (i.e. Butcher and one Jarvis, the adjuster for another company) had a list of the goods and I thought the proofs of loss could be made up from the appraisement they were making.\nThis (if it amounts to anything) clearly relates to a time after the expiration of the fourteen days prescribed for furnishing the particular statement or account. It consequently appears that there was no substantial evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find as they did upon this question, and the plaintiff is in the position of having omitted to comply with a condition precedent to his right of recovery. The implied authority of a person acting in Mr. Butcher's capacity was considered under somewhat similar circumstances in Atlas Ins. Co. v. Brownell[35] decided this term.\nWere the evidence much stronger than it is, the plaintiff under the circumstances of this case, would find himself precluded from availing himself of any waiver on the part of Mr. Butcher by the full and explicit provisions of the 19th condition stipulating that\nno one of the foregoing conditions or stipulations, either in whole or in part, shall be deemed to have been waived by or on the part of the company unless the waiver be clearly expressed in writing by indorsement upon this policy signed by the agent of the company at Halifax, N. S. There were other substantial objections to recovery argued upon the appeal which it is not necessary to decide upon.\nThe result is that the appeal is allowed, the judgments of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and of the Honourable Mr. Justice Meagher are reversed and set aside, and the action is dismissed with costs to the appellant in all the courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Hector McInnes.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Joseph A.

C.\u2014Art. 748 C. P. Q.\nAn inspector of an insolvent estate is a person having duties of a fiduciary nature to perform in respect thereto and he cannot be allowed to become purchaser, on his own account, of any part of the estate of the insolvent. Davis v. Kerr, (17 Can. S. C. R. 235) followed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, (appeal side), affirming the decision of the Superior Court, District of Athabasca, which dismissed the appellant's petition with costs. The appellant petitioned for the cancellation of a sale of part of an insolvent estate sold under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure in the Province of Quebec upon the advice of the inspectors appointed by the creditors of the insolvent, on the ground, amongst others, that one of the inspectors had become purchaser on his own account of the property sold by the sheriff under an order by the court. The petition was refused by the Superior Court, and the present appeal is from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench affirming that decision.\nFitzpatrick Q.C. (Solicitor-General for Canada), and Cr\u00e9peau, for the appellant, cited arts. 1484 and 1706 C. C. and art. 748 C. P. Q.\nGeoffrion Q.C. and Cot\u00e9 for the respondents (M\u00e9thot with them). Articles 1484 and 1706 C. C. and art. 748 C. P. Q. do not apply to Sales made under judicial authority, nor to inspectors of insolvent estates. The powers and duties of inspectors are given by arts. 877-879 C. P. Q. They have not possession of the property and cannot control sales; their duties are merely advisory.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Upon the ground that the inspector to an insolvent estate cannot be allowed to pur-chase any of the property of the insolvent as the respondent has done, I would allow the appeal and annul this sale. It is a principle of law which courts of justice are bound to strictly apply that no one having duties of a fiduciary character to discharge should be allowed to put his duties in conflict with his interest Davis v. Kerr ([1]), at page 246\nNous \u00e9carterons donc ces mandataires afin de ne pas les placer entre leur int\u00e9r\u00eat et leur devoir. Boitard, Proc. vol. 2, (10 \u00e9d.) p. 353 ([2]). That is the principle upon which are based articles 1484 and 1706 of the Civil Code, and article 748 of the Code of Procedure.\nThe respondent himself alleges that it was upon the advice of the inspectors that this property was sold as two separate lots. This shows that the inspectors have more to do with the sale of the insolvent's estate than he contended for at the argument. They advise merely, it is true, but that advice must be wholly disinterested, and, for instance, the very time or season chosen by them for the sale may be one where the property is likely to be sold at a lower rate, and if they are allowed to buy, their interest would be adverse to the creditors' interests. I cannot divest my mind of the opinion that it would be opening the door to frauds if the courts failed to forbid such dealings. Such was Mr. Justice Ouimet's opinion in the Court of Appeal, and I fully share in it.\nAppeal allowed with costs, and petition to set aside sale granted with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cr\u00e9peau & Cr\u00e9peau.\nSolicitors for the respondent, J.

TasChereau J. (dissenting.)\u2014The appellant in this case asks to reverse, upon mere questions of fact, the concurrent findings of both the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal, in which the six judges who sat in the case were unanimous. There is nothing in the record which, in my opinion, would justify us in doing so.\nWhatever personal opinion I may have of the respondent's claim I cannot forget, I need hardly say, that I am not a witness in the case, and that it is upon the evidence and only upon the evidence, as found in the record, that we have to determine the controversy between the parties. Now that evidence is with a single exception all one way, and the trial judge did not hesitate to maintain instanter the respondent's action. The Court of Appeal unanimously affirmed that decision.\nThat the respondent was employed by the appellant is admitted by the pleas to numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 12, not by the day or by the month but, as he claims, at so much a lot and the only contestation raised by the appellant is as to the quantum merit and value of the respondent's services. Now the witness Bourque, a civil engineer, who was the secretary of the Expropriation Commissioners, swears that he notified the respondent of his appointment, that he requested him to proceed with his work, and only notified him to cease in November or December ; that he officially certified his claim as correct, and that leaving aside all tariffs and preceding relations between the parties in similar matters the claim of the respondent was a just and reasonable one and did not exceed the value of his services. James Nelson, an architect, who had a personal knowledge of the respondent's work, says:\nI consider the plaintiff's account is a fair one. * * * I reason on the basis of the value of his services. Mr. Cadieux is a very compatent man indeed. * * * (By the Court.)\u2014Then you think the amount charged in his account is a fair and reasonable one?\u2014A. I think so, your honour.\nJames Rafter, a real estate agent, who also had a personal knowledge of the respondent's services, and of the nature of his claim, being asked:\nNow will you tell us what is your opinion of the value of the plaintiff's services?\u2014A. Well, I know that I would not like to go through the sanie work again for the same pay.\nAnd on cross-examination, he says that the respondent was working for the city for the whole time from June to December, and that he considers his account a fair one. \u201cFor myself,\" he adds again, \u201cI would not do the same work for the same pay.\"\nSimeon Lesage, an architect and civil engineer, testifies in the same sense. The respondent himself, examined as a witness, testifies to the correctness of his claim as to the work done, the number of the lots and as to the valu\u00e9 of his services, and Isa\u00efe Pr\u00e9 fontaine corroborates him in all particulars.\nAgainst all that evidence the appellant invokes the evidence of Robb, the city treasurer, who simply swears, on cross-examination, that he adheres to the opinion he expressed in a report of a special committee of which he formed part filed in the case as exhibit 65 at enqu\u00eate. Now, on reference to that document, it seems clear that all that was referred to that special committee and all that they could deal with, were the claims of the proprietor's witnesses, not the claims, as the respondent's is, of the city's witnesses. But assuming that Robb, with no personal knowledge whatever of the details of the respondent's services, has sworn that the respondent has been fully paid, and even overpaid therefore by the amount he has already received, I do not see how his evidence, entirely unsupported as it stands in the record, could preponderate against the evidence so clear and conclusive of the other six witnesses, each and every one of them heard before the trial judge, believed by him and by five judges in appeal. They have, it is true, claims of the same nature against the city, but that by itself alone is under the circumstances, insufficient to justify us in reversing the judgment appealed from. I would hesitate here to stigmatise as incredible and unworthy of belief all of these witnesses. And it seems to me that is what the appellant asks us to do upon this appeal. We cannot do so, it seems to me, without setting at naught a constant jurisprudence of the House of Lords and of the Privy Council, strictly adhered to by us heretofore, as to appeals upon questions of fact from the concurrent findings of two courts Smith v. St. Lawrence Tow Boat Co. ([1]) \" Allen v. Quebec Warehouse Co. ([2]); McIntyre v. McGavin ([3]); Colonial Securityes v. Massery ([4]).\nGWYNEE J.\u2014Plaintiff could only recover on a quantum meruit, and although he claims for service of several mouths yet he had not offered any evidence whatever to show how much of such period was occupied in the service claimed for. In fact his only evidence is that upon a former occasion for like services he charged in the same manner and was paid; but we must bear in mind that the corporation are the ratepayers whose funds are sought to be made liable and that if their servants on a former occasion, or upon several former occasions, submitted to extortion that is no reason for the continuance of the practice being sanctioned by the court.\nKing J.\u2014concurred with the majority of the court. GIROUARD J.\u2014I entirely concur in the statement of facts as presented by Mr. Justice Hall, speaking apparently for the whole court, but I cannot accept his conclusions. The learned judge says:\nThe respondent and two others, with Mr. Nelson, architect, were appointed by the City Council of Montreal, on the 21st June, 1895, to act as experts for the tenants under the expropriation proceedings of 1894. Three other persons were appointed by the same resolution to act as experts for the proprietors under the same expropriations. Public notice was given that the commissioners for settling the terms of expropriation would not be appointed until 4th September. In the months of July and August the subject of discontinuing all expropriations was discussed in the City Council, and in the latter month a resolution was adopted that the Superior Court be asked to grant a month's delay in all the cases, which application was granted, and on the 19th of that month a formal judgment was pronounced, terminating all the procedure in the matters of expropriations. On the 21st December of that year the Legislature of the Province of Quebec confirmed and legalized this termination of the expropriation proceedings which had been commence in this city.\nIn the meantime the persons who had thus been appointed to act as experts in case the expropriations were proceeded with, without any instructions from the city officials, and without the knowledge, apparently, of those of the officials who would naturally have been called upon to superintend such work, but with a diligence which could not have been too highly applauded had it been exercised under other circumstances were quietly proceeding with the examination and valuation of all the properties which the expropriation proceedings of 1894 had designated as the next in order for the widening of streets in case the city should continue that work. Engrossed apparently in the discharge of these assumed duties, they appear neither to have heard in the public deliberations in the council nor to have read in the reports in the public press, the determination of the City Council for reasons of economy, to seek relief from the burden of these expropriations. The Act of the legislature in December appears to have been the first information which arrested their attention They ceased then their labonrs, and presented to the council their bills for the work thus performed by them since the preceding 21st June about five months, amounting to the sum of $7,605.60 each for the three unprofessional experts, and $9,278 for the architect\u2014a little over $32000 for the tenants' experts alone\u2014for work for which the city had no use which it never required and has never used The bills were made out upon the basis of $20 for each 25 feet frontage of imp proved. properties, and of $8 per 25 feet frontage of vacant properties, which it appears was the scale upon which the experts had been paid in the previous expropriations, Some opposition was made in the council to the payment of these bills, but principally upon the ground that a new tariff had been adopted of $20 per improved and $8 per vacant lot, irrespective of extent of frontage : but upon investigation it did not appear that this modification of the tariff had been communicated to those to whom it was intended to apply\u2014and the experts therefore claimed payment upon the basis of their previous settlements.\nA committee of the city officials was appointed to examine and report upon the matter, which they did to this effect, that one-half the amounts charged would be ample compensation for the work done under the existing tariff. By authority of the finance committee of the city, payments were made to these experts from time to time, amounting in the aggregate to one-half the amount of their several claims.\nPayment of the balance being refused, the plaintiff took the present action for the balance of his account, $3,805. The city contested the action upon the ground that the plaintiff had never been employed or set to work to make the valuations in question and moreover, even if he had been so employed the value of his services did not exceed the tariff regulation therefor, to wit $20 per improved and $8 per vacant lot\u2014being one-half the amount of the account sued upon.\nThe plaintiff examined as witnesses, himself his colleagues the secretary of the city expropriation bureau and the city treasurer The latter testified only to the payments made on account by order of the finance committee. All the others supported plaintiff's claim to its fullest extent, whether based on the tariff recognised for previous expropriations, or even for the actual value of the service rendered. The city examined no witnesses in defence.\nIt is doubtful if, independently of payment on account, the plaintiff had any legal right of action against the city for pretended services volunteered by him merely upon a resolution of the council appointing him, and without any instruction from a responsible city official as to the commencement, prosecution or termination of his work. But, by a payment of 50 per cent upon his claim, the city has deprived itself of this ground of its defence, and was left only with what remained, viz., a contestation over the real value of the services actually rendered. When it is considered that plaintiff's bill is upon the basis of $18,000 per annum for the services of a carpenter expert, whose regular business, it is proved, was not much interfered with by the attention he was obliged to give in examining the properties designated for expropriation, and that three others were engaged to perform the same service it would seem that a reasonable opportunity existed of sustaining defendant's plea in this respect. The city, however appears to have considered the effort a hopeless one, or was per-haps convinced that this estimate of the value of the plaintiff's s services was after all not exaggerated. At all events, they examined no witnesses in support of their plea, and hence the trial judge, with nothing before him but plaintiff's own evidence, had no alternative but to maintain plaintiff's action to its fullest extent, without the formality even of taking it en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, and we equally, for the same reason have none but to dismiss the city's appeal.\nI do not agree that there is no evidence adduced on behalf of the city. When Treasurer Robb is cross-examined Mr. Archambault Q.C. of counsel for the defendant,\ndeclares his intention of examining witness as his own witness to save recalling him.\nThe witness is asked:\nQ. Will you pl\u00e9ase look at this exhibit, Mr. Robb, now shown you, marked plaintiff's Exhibit P. 5, and state whether this purports to be signed by you at the end of the report ?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. That's your signature there?\u2014A. Yes, I have no doubt that it is an exact copy of the report which has been prepared by Mr. Ethier and myself.\nQ. And you are still of the same opinion as you were when you gave that?\u2014A. I am still of the same opinion as I was then.\nExhibit P. 5 is the report of the city officials to which Mr. Justice Hall refers in which the majority of them, MM. Ethier Q.C, Defence and Robb (Bourque, dissenting), considers that half of the amount charged is ample compensation for the work done and Mr. Robb, under oath, persists in his report. It is true that there is some evidence that the value of the respondent's services was as claimed by him. That evidence was given by interested parties, his colleagues, who have similar claims still pending\u2014 and also by the secretary of the city expropriation commissioners, Bourque, who, for reasons not explained, dissented, from the three other city officials, Ethier, Defence and Robb It is based upon the fact that like services were previously paid at the same rate; but if the corporation or their servants, on a former occasion, or upon several previous occasions, submitted to what appears to have been most exorbitant claims, that is no reason for the continuance of the practice in the present instance where it is resisted. The evidence of Mr. Robb and his report concurred in by MM. Ethier and Defense are more satisfactory ; they establish clearly, to my mind, that a gross injustice has been done to the appellants, and although this appeal only involves a question of facts decided by two courts, we have no hesitation in arriving at the conclusion that the respondent has been well paid and that his action for the other half of his account must be dismissed We are therefore of opinion that the appeal must be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ethier & Archambault.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Beaudin, Cardinal, Loranger & St. Germain.\n[1] L.R. 5 P.

Caston (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1899: June 6.\nPresent: Sir Henry Strong C.J. and Taschereau, Gwynne, King and Girouard JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMaster and servant\u2014Hiring of servant by third party\u2014Control over service\u2014Negligence.\nA Plate Glass Co. hired by the day the general servant and horse and wagon of another company for use in its business, and while so hired the servant in carrying a load of glass knocked a man down and seriously injured him.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (26 Ont. App. R. 63) that the Plate Glass Co. was not liable in damages for the injury; that the driver remained the general servant of the company from which he was hired and not that of the Plate Glass Co.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice in favour of the plaintiff.\nOn the 13th of February, 1895, the plaintiff was injured by colliding with a vehicle while crossing from the curbstone to the railway track on Church Street, in the City of Toronto, to board a street car going north on said street. The vehicle with which he collided was a waggon belonging to The Cobban Manufacturing Company, and the horse attached thereto was owned by said company and driven by one of its servants.\nFor the purpose of doing its cartage business in the City of Toronto, the defendants had entered into an agreement with The Cobban Manufacturing Co. by which The Cobban Company agreed to supply a horse, wagon and driver to the defendant whenever required for the use of their business, at $3 a day. On the day in question the defendant had procured a horse, waggon and driver from The Cobban Company, under the above arrangement, and had requested the driver to deliver some glass at the office of Scott & Walmsley on the west side of Church Street, in the said city. Upon the glass being delivered it was discovered that the windows in which the glass was to be placed were so high that it would be impossible to do the work without procuring a ladder, and accordingly the defendant\u2019s foreman asked the driver to take him to the shop of one Phillips, on Church Street, above King Street, where he could procure a ladder and place it on said waggon and have it delivered at said office of Scott & Walmsley, and it was whilst going for such ladder that the accident occurred.\nThe plaintiff brought an action for damages in consequence of said injury, and on the trial before Mr. Justice MacMahon said action was dismissed. This decision was reversed by the Chancery Division whose judgment was sustained by the Court of Appeal. The defendants then appealed to this court.\nC.J. Ritchie Q.C. for the appellant.\nJ.W. McCullough and Roche for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (Oral).\u2014We are of opinion that this appeal must be allowed and the judgment of MacMahon J. restored. The cause does not turn upon any nice distinction between the facts of this case and those upon which previous authorities have proceeded. It depends upon well settled principles con- cerning the responsibility of masters for the acts of their servants. The leading case is Quarman v. Burnett[2], and the facts proved in that case do not make it an exception to the principle of that decision in which the Court of Exchequer adopted the opinions of Lord Tenterden C.J. and Littledale J. in Laugher v. Pointer[3].\nThis case of Quarman v. Burnett2 has been recognized as an authority and acted on as such in several subsequent cases. Rapson v. Cubitt[4]; Dalyell v. Tyrer[5]; Jones v. Corporation of Liverpool[6]; Little v. Hackett[7].\nThe two cases relied on in support of the judgment under appeal are not in point. In Rourke v. White Moss Colliery Co.[8] the engineer was held not to be the servant of the defendants inasmuch as it had been expressly stipulated by the parties for whom the work was being done that they should have entire control of the engine and engineer.\nIn Jones v. Scullard[9] the facts were different; the whole control of the driver was in the defendant who was the owner of the carriage, horse and harness, and the Lord Chief Justice so far from indicating any intention to overrule Quarman v. Burnett[10], expressly adopts it, for he cites approvingly a passage from the Judgment of Bowen L.J. in Donovan v. Laing Syndicate[11] to that effect and then proceeds as follows:\nThe principle then to be extracted from the cases is that if the hirer simply applies to the livery stable keeper to drive him between certain points or for a certain period of time and the latter supplies all necessary for that purpose, the hirer is in no sense responsible for any negligence on the part of the driver. A fair and reasonable test to apply, is this: Could the hirer have himself taken absolute control of the vehicle, horse and harness, taking it altogether out of the possession of the driver? In the present case the appellants clearly had no right to do so; under the facts proved in Jones v. Scullard[12] the defendant could undoubtedly have done so.\nThe appeal is allowed and the action dismissed with costs to the appellants in all the courts below as well as the costs of this appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ritchie, Ludwig & Ballantyne.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.W.

Judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick reversed. Appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick en banc, affirming the decision of the trial judge which directed that a verdict should be entered for the plaintiff for damages and costs.\nThe defendants moved, pursuant to leave reserved at the trial, to set aside the said verdict, and to enter a verdict for the defendants or for a new trial. The present appeal is from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick refusing the motion. The questions at issue on the appeal are stated in the judgment of the court delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice King.\nGregory Q.C. for the appellants.\nStockton Q.C. and Connell Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nKING J\u2014The action is for encumbering or obstructing a public highway which adjoins the plaintiff's property and preventing access to the main road.\nIt was sought to establish the existence of the public highway by dedication. This involves two things; (1) an intention on the part of the owner of the land to dedicate, and (2) an acceptance by the public of such road as a highway. This is evidenced by user.\nAs to the intention of the owner to dedicate, the plaintiff (the present respondent), relies upon a lease from the Connell heirs to Craig, through whom the defendants claim. Immediately following the description of the land, which made no reference to a road, and in which there was no reservation of a road, there was a diagram showing a public road in the place where the plaintiff claims it to have been and there was a covenant by the lessees, their, etc.,\nthat the road or street now open between the rear of the ]and deede to the late Richard English (the plaintiff's land), and the bank of the Maduxnakik to the River St. John and Maduxnakik Creek will be kept open for the use of the public, ten feet wide.\nAssuming that, upon the construction of the lease, there must be taken to have been an intention on the part of the lessors to dedicate the way as shown in the diagram, still there remains the question of acceptance by the public.\nThere was evidence on the part of the plaintiff that there was a public user of a road where it is shown by the diagram, but the defendants had an equally large body of testimony showing that the user was where they claim that the road was, viz., nearer the bank of the creek. The jury have adopted the defendants' view, and according to their findings there was no way used by the public except where the defendants say it was.\nThe learned trial judge directed a verdict for the plaintiff, notwithstanding the findings, upon his construction of the lease, and the Supreme Court of New Brunswick has sustained his judgment. This conclusion, however, takes no account of the necessity to establish a public use of the alleged way. The company has entirely failed to get a finding in its favour upon the point of user, and has therefore failed in making out the case it set out to make. The judgment below must therefore be reversed, and, as all the facts were fully gone into, it would best meet the justice of the case to direct that judgment should be entered for the defendants.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Hartley & Carvell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fisher & A.

No such appeal can be taken to this court, as section 31 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act expressly provides that \u201cNo appeal shall be allowed in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of Habeas Corpus arising out of any claim for extradition made under any treaty.\u201d The original Act did not contain this limitation, but in the year after that Act came into force, as soon, in fact as the court was properly organized, it was amended by the insertion of the provision I have mentioned, and from that time to the present there has never been any question as to our want of jurisdiction in such cases.\nWe are now asked to hear a motion to quash an appeal which section 31 prohibits. There is no necessity for such a motion. The matter is coram non judice. We have no jurisdiction, and the authorities who have charge of the extradition proceedings will, no doubt, on being advised as to the appeal being entirely nugatory, take the proper steps.\nSuch appeals should not be encouraged, and as there is no necessity for a motion to quash the court declines to name a special day to hear one.\nApplication refused.\n[1] 30 O.R. 419.\n"}

At a point on Elgin Street, about 150 feet south of the centre line of Catherine Street, which crosses Elgin Street at right angles, Elgin Street is crossed on the level by the main line of the defendant company\u2019s railway, and to the north and south of the defendant company\u2019s main line are side lines which are used by the defendant for the purposes of its business. A flagman in the employ of the defendant company, was stationed at the crossing at the time of the accident in question.\nOn the day on which the accident happened the plaintiff was driving southward on Elgin Street in the direction of the railway crossing, intending, as he says, to proceed to his summer residence, situated on the Rideau River. When the plaintiff\u2019s horse had reached a point some distance north of the most northerly track, and which was about fifty feet to the north of the main line of the defendant\u2019s railway, the plaintiff and his coachman, who was driving, became aware of an engine approaching on the main line. The horses were immediately turned and headed north on Elgin Street, but, owing, as the plaintiff alleges, to the fright occasioned by the appearance of the locomotive and the noise it made in crossing Elgin Street, they became restive; one of the horses reared violently, and, in so doing, broke the poll strap attached to his collar and fell, tearing away the other horse\u2019s bridle. The driver then, in consequence of the harness being thus rendered useless for the purpose, could not guide or rein in the team, and the horses ran away, upsetting and breaking the carriage and harness and injuring the plaintiff and his son, who was riding in the carriage with the plaintiff.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice MacMahon and a jury to whom certain questions were submitted, which with their answers thereto are as follows:\u2014\n1. At what distance from Elgin street crossing did No. 1 engine start westward?\u2014A. About 300 feet.\n2. When the engine started westward was the bell rung, and did it continue ringing at short intervals until it crossed Elgin street?\u2014A. It did not ring. 3. If you find the bell was not rung as mentioned in question No. 2, did the neglect to so ring the bell cause the driver of Dr. Henderson\u2019s carriage to do any act which he would not otherwise have done?\u2014A. Yes.\n4. What was such act?\u2014A. Drove forward.\nQ. And did it contribute to the accident?\u2014A. Yes.\n5. Was engine No. 1 when going west, and before it reached Elgin street running faster than six miles an hour? If so, how fast?\u2014A. Believe train was going over six miles an hour; not competent to say how much faster.\n6. Did the flagman give warning to the plaintiff\u2019s driver not to cross?\u2014A. Do not believe that flagman raised his hand.\n7. Did the horses rear or bolt before or after the engine crossed Elgin street?\u2014A. After.\n8. What caused the horses to rear and bolt?\u2014A. Fright from engine.\n9. Was the pole-strap reasonably fixed for the purpose for which it was used?\u2014A. Yes.\n10. Is the injury of which Dr. Henderson complains wholly due to mental shock, or is it attributable partly to mental shock and partly to shock caused by a blow?\u2014A. Partly from shock and blow.\nAt what do you assess the damages?\n(a.) In respect of injury to horses, carriage, and harness?\u2014A. $380.\n(b.) In respect of personal injury resulting exclusively from mental shock, $600.\n(c.) In respect of shock caused by blows?\u2014$400.\nOn these findings judgment was entered for the plaintiff with $780 damages, the learned judge refusing to allow the $600 assessed by the jury for mental shock. The company appealed, and plaintiff took a cross-appeal for the $600. Both appeals were dis- missed by the Court of Appeal, and the company then appealed to this court.\nChrysler Q.C. and Bethune for the appellant. It was a shunting engine that passed the crossing when the plaintiff was injured, and sec. 253 of the Railway Act requiring the bell to be rung or whistle sounded does not apply in such case. Hollinger v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[2]; Bennett v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[3]\nWallace, Nesbitt and Macfarlane for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (Oral).\u2014We think it is not desirable to reserve judgment in this case, as we are all satisfied with the decision of the Court of Appeal which affirms the judgment of Mr. Justice MacMahon at the trial in favour of the plaintiff. It was indeed the only judgment that could have been entered upon the evidence given.\nAs regards section 256 of the Railway Act, I consider that that section applies not only to the general traffic, but also to shunting and other temporary movements in connection with the running of trains. This section provides that a bell should be rung or a whistle sounded at at least eighty rods distance from a crossing. It is a very great indulgence to railway companies to be allowed to run their trains through streets on the level subject only to the requirements of giving warning on approaching the crossings.\nThe jury found that this section was not complied with, and that the plaintiff\u2019s coachman was induced to go ahead by the non-ringing of the bell, and that contributed to the accident, and when the horses became terrified by the sound of the approaching engine, a part of the harness broke, and they became unmanageable. I think that is quite sufficient to make the company liable under the statute, without any finding of common law negligence. The fact that the signalman did not raise his hand was not the cause of the accident, and I think the jury evidently meant that he did not make any signal, and that they intended to find, as in the answer to the other question, that that fact also contributed to the accident.\nFurther, I think it right to say that on this evidence we should be justified in holding that there was common law negligence as in the case of The St. Lawrence & Ottawa Railway Co. v. Lett[4].\nI think there was no case made out for a new trial, and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I concur in what His Lordship has said. I think it would be absurd to hold that section 256 of the Railway Act does not apply to a shunting engine approaching a crossing as well as to the regular trains.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I do not wish to express an opinion as to whether or not section 256 applies in the case of shunting. I consider it unnecessary to do so, but on the case found by the jury I am of opinion that if ringing the bell would prevent an accident to a person crossing the highway there is an obligation at common law to ring it, and it is negligence not to do so. It is for the jury to say whether or not the neglect to ring the bell contributed to the accident, and they have done so.\nKING J.\u2014also concurred.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I think the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Chrysler & Bethune.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

A. the contractor of the former company, presented a claim which was approved of and paid to the extent of $175,000, whereupon he paid over $100,000 of the amount to P. for services performed in organizing the new company and obtaining payment of the claim. The Government afterwards brought an action against P. to recover back the $100,000 on the ground that A.'s claim was fictitious and was paid on fraudulent misrepresentations.\nHeld that the action must fail if it could not have been maintained against A. ; that the onus was on the Crown of proving A.'s claim to be fictitious ; that the Crown not only failed to satisfy such onus but the evidence clearly established the claim to be a just and reasonable one ; and that the action could not be maintained as it did not ask for cancellation of the Order-in-Council and the letter of credit issued and that the payment made by the Crown thereunder should be set aside\nHeld, further, that the payment to A., with the consent of the new company, was a discharge to the Government pro tanto of the subsidy due to the company, and if wrongfully paid the latter only could recover it back Held) also, that even if the Crown could have recovered the amount from A., it could not succeed against P., who, as the record showed, had ample reason for believing that the company was indented to A., as claimed.\nEvidence received before the a Royal Commission was filed of record by consent \" to avail as evidence \" on the trial.\nHeld, that, notwithstanding the consent, such evidence could not be accepted as proof in the cause.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada, sitting in review, at Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, maintaining the action with cost.\nThe action was upon information by the Attorney General for Quebec against the defendant, (with Armstrong, a contractor, and the Baie des Chaleurs Railway Co., mis en cause,) for the recovery from defendant of $100,000 alleged to have been obtained from the Quebec Government by unlawful and improper means contrived by him and Armstrong with the aid of others, who obtained the passing of an Order-in-Council for payment by the Provincial Government of a subsidy to the railway out of which $175,000 was paid to Armstrong and $100,000 thereof handed over by him to the defendant. It was alleged that neither Armstrong nor defendant had any claim which could entitle either of them to any part of said subsidy, nor had the defendant any legal claim against Armstrong and, consequently, that the money had been misapplied and paid out in error. The information prayed judgment against defendant for $100,-000 and that the other parties should be summoned to hear such condemnation. The defendant alone appeared and pleaded a demurrer and perpetual exception setting up that the money paid to him belonged to Armstrong, and that the province had no claim thereto. The Superior Court, Andrews J. dismissed the demurrer and plea and entered judgment for the $100,-000 and costs on the following grounds, viz. :\nConsidering the said demurrer is unfounded in law ;\nConsidering it is proved that the said C. N. Armstrong had in fact no legitimate right to any portion of the said subsidy, and the said Ernest Pacaud, on his part, no right, even as against the said C. N. Armstrong, to be paid any amount whatever, his only claim thereto being based on an unlawful agreement with the said C. N. Armstrong, contrary to public order, whereby he was to use his influence with certain members of the then executive of this province to bring about the passing of the said order in council and the recognition of rights in Armstrong having no-legal existence ;\nConsidering it has been made apparent that the payment of the said sum of one hundred thousand dollars out of the Provincial treasury was the contemplated result of a scheme continued by the said Ernest Pacaud and C. N. Armstrong to obtain from the said treasury to their mutual gain, a sum of one hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars, whereof it was from the first designed and understood between them that the said Ernest Pacaud should get one hundred thousand dollars as his share ;\nConsidering that as to the said sum of one hundred thousand dollars, Armstrong was a mere instrument and confederate aiding the said Pacaud to possess himself of it ;\nConsidering it is also proved that the Baie des Chaleurs Railway Company did not complete the works which they undertook as a consideration for said subsidy, and only on the completion of which they would become entitled thereto ; Considering it is also proved that the said Baie des Chaleurs Railway remains encumbered by a privileged claim carrying with it a lien, in favour of one Henry Macfarlane for work by him done on the said railway as a sub-contractor of the said C. N. Armstrong, for a sum much exceeding one hundred thousand dollars s\nConsidering that the said plaintiff, as the custodian of the said subsidy, has a legal interest and right to recover the said sum of one hundred thousand dollars, forming part thereof, and so misapplied and unlawfully taken therefrom, in order to apply it to its legitimate purpose of freeing pro tanto, the said railway from the said lien of the said Henry Macfarlane :\nConsidering not only that the said Ernest Pacaud has no right whatever to the said sum of one hundred thousand dollars, but that it is also against public order that he should be allowed to retain it.\"\nThe present appeal is from the judgment of the Court of Review affirming the decision of the Supreme Court.\nFitzpatrick Q.C. (Solicitor General of Canada), and O'Gara Q.C. for the appellant. The money paid to the defendant appears, even by the notes of the trial judge, to have belonged to Armstrong. It had been certified to by the directors of the railway company and the engineer in charge, in settlement of a genuine claim and payable to him on handing over the road free from debt to the new company. Armstrong had fulfilled this condition and was entitled to full control of the $175,000. There has been no duress \u00abor unlawful action shown against either him or the defendant. The Crown had no control or right of action in respect of it after it had been paid, and cannot inquire as to what disposition was made of the funds. We refer to the following cases as bearing on the questions at issue, viz. ; Mogul Steamship Co. v. McGregor Gow & Co ([1]) ; Allen v. Flood ([2]) ; Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik v. Schott, Segner & Co. ([3]) ; The Queen v. Dunn ([4]), at page 402; Canada Central Railway Co. v. The Queen ([5]) ; Clarke v. Eckroyd ([6]) ; Hereford Railway Co. v. Tue Queen ([7]). Even if the contract between Armstrong and the defendant had been illegal, the money paid cannot be recovered back ; Kearley v. Thomson ([8]).\nMatthew Hutchinson for the Crown. The money was paid under misapprehension, in error of law and in error of fact. It was a payment sine caus\u00c6 without the existence of any lawful debt and through the mis-representation made by the defendant and mises en cause. See Dalloz '55, 1,108. The pretended services, or more accurately artifices, for which defendant himself admits he did not expect to receive more than four or five thousand dollars, are essentially immoral and contrary to public order, and the payment made of them bears, in itself, this character of immorality and illegality which removes all possibility of claiming-payment There was thus between Armstrong and the defendant illegality and immorality of consideration, condictio ob turpem causam, and there was a nullity contrary to public order, and to these there was added the nullity of the execution itself by which they knowingly appropriated Government money to themselves. Both of them must then be declared to have been in bad faith and if the defendant was in bad faith there is a direct action against him. 3 Arntz, no. 473, p. 255 ; 13 Locr\u00e9 p. 39, no. 7 ; 5 Pothier, no. 170 p. 119 ; St. Michel v. Guilleminot ([9]) ; 2 Mourlon p. 885 4 Aubry et Rau, p. 789, par. 40, no. 3 ; Dalloz, R\u00e9p. Vo. Obi. no. 5489. See also arts. 989, 990 and 1047 C. C.\nThe defendant argues that the Government has no right of action, as it has lost nothing ; that this money was to be handed over to the railway company. That is true, but only upon certain conditions which were not executed, that is to say, after the completion of works which were not done, and especially upon the conditions that the privileged debts should be paid with the moneys which have been diverted from their express destination. Again a Government subsidy to a railway is not so much for the railway company as for the section of country to be developed, a political, social obligation, a need to satisfy. If the grant is diverted the need still subsists and with it the obligation to satisfy it, a matter of public interest which the Government is bound to see properly discharged.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice\nTaschereau and Mr. Justice Girouard.\nTaschereau J.\u2014The facts that bear upon this case are not complicated. Of the formidable volume of rover 1,000 pages containing the inquiry Of the Royal Commission more than two thirds of the eighty-nine depositions and two hundred exhibits thereof filed by consent as part of this record (assuming them to have been legally filed) are altogether irrelevant and have no application whatever to the issue between the parties, besides being in a large measure inadmissible as evidence in a court of justice As to the law a correct appreciation of the facts leaves no room for controversy.\nIn 1891, the undertaking known as the Baie des Chaleurs Railway was on the verge of a total failure. The company, the contractors, the sub-contractors, were all insolvent ; the whole of the earned subsidies granted by both the federal and the provincial governments had been exhausted ; all work on the ground had been suspended for over a year ; whatever had been done was in a dilapidated state and deteriorating more and more every day ; the distressing condition and sufferings of the contractors' unpaid workmen were engaging the attention of the whole country ; a statute had been passed enabling the Government to cancel the company's charter and wind up its business 54 Vict., ch. 37, and all previous attempts to reorganize the company and enable it to continue and complete its undertaking had proved abortive.\nIt was under these circumstances that, in March 1891, one Thorn, who was a creditor of the company as a member of the firm of Cooper Fairman & Co. taking advantage of an additional subsidy granted by the provincial legislature on the 30th December preceding (54 Vict., ch. 88), at the suggestion of one Armstrong, the contractor of the company and interested therein, succeeded in forming a syndicate accepted as being of sufficient financial strength to complete this railway, which, it was admitted on all hands, was a work greatly needed in the public interest and of vast importance not only to the large extent of the country which it was intended by the legislature thereby more directly to benefit, but also to the whole Dominion as a feeder to the federal road known as the Intercolonial Railway.\nHaving come to an understanding with the owners of the charter, Thorn, acting for the syndicate so formed, entered with the Government into negotiations, which resulted in the acceptance by the Government of his propositions by the order-in-council no. 237, approved of by the Lieutenant-Governor on the 23rd April, 1891. This order-in-council appears to have been carefully drawn and bears intrinsic evidence of the Government's desire to protect the company's creditors by the right thereby reserved to the Government to itself pay under certain conditions the actual debts of the company, through an officer appointed for that purpose, out of the land subsidy converted into cash (conceded to be equivalent to $280,-000) granted by the Act of the then last session of the Legislature, 54 Vict., ch. 88, already referred to, which said subsidy converted into cash to the amount necessary therefor, the Government bound itself by the said order-in-council to pay to the creditors of the company whose claims would be approved of by Thorn or determined by arbitration. On the same day, by another order-in-council one J. C. Langelier was appointed the commissioner to pay these claims as provided for by aforesaid order-in-council no. 237.\nAfterwards, on the same day again, Armstrong handed to the said Commissioner Langelier a claim of $298,943.62, which he had against the company.\nImmediately, or on the next day, Langelier sent this claim to Thorn for the approval required from him by the order-in-council no. 237. Thorn, who had seen or heard of it before, answered that he approved it but only to the amount of $175,000. Langelier then wrote to the Commissioner of Public Works that Thorn had deposited in his hands $500,000 worth of debentures as required by his contract with the Government contained in the order-in-council no. 237, and had otherwise fulfilled all the obligations imposed upon him by the said order-in council, asking at the same time, as prompt action was required, that the funds necessary to enable him to immediately commence the payment of the debts of the company be placed at his disposal. The commissioner, or his deputy, being subsequently shown Armstrong's claim, the consent by Thorn that $175,000 of that claim should be paid by the Government, the certificates of the engineers, and the admission by the managing director and by the secretary of the old company that the claim as filed was a correct statement of the work done by him remaining unpaid, after, moreover, getting the opinions of the law officers of the Crown, and acting altogether as cautiously as possible m the matter ordered the payment of the claim to the amount of $175,000 and informed Langelier of it. Langelier accordingly paid $100,000 thereof to Armstrong by his cheques on the Union Bank to Armstrong's order, five in number, for $20,000 each, which cheques Armstrong immediately indorsed and handed over to the appellant who later on got them cashed The balance of $75,000 was also paid to Armstrong or to his order, but these $75,000 are not in question here. It is simply the $100,000 paid as aforesaid to Armstrong, and repaid by Armstrong to appellant, of which the Crown now demands the reimbursement from the appellant. This demand is based exclusively on the ground that Armstrong's claim was a fictitiuss and a fraudulent one and that the company did not owe him anything, to the knowledge of the appellant ; that it was the appellant who, at Armstrong's request, had succeeded by undue influence and corrupt means in obtaining from the Government these $100,000 which immediately upon receiving them, under a previous agreement between them, Armstrong had paid over to him the appellant without consideration or for an illegal and immoral consideration.\nIt is admitted by the appellant, whilst denying all fraud on his part or on the part of Armstrong in the matter, and all the allegations of the information as to bribery undue influence or fraudulent acts whatsoever on their part, that under a previous agreement with Armstrong, he, Armstrong, immediately upon receiving those $100,000 from Lansrelier, indorsed the cheques and handed them over to him, the appellant, as remuneration and payment for his services in acting as agent for the said Armstrong in the negotiations with the Government relating to the formation of the new syndicate and the settlement of said Armstrong's claim.\nIt results from this synopsis of the case that the fact to be first investigated is the one declared upon on the part of the Crown, that Armstrong had no claim whatever against the railway company. For it was conceded at the argument that the Crown cannot recover these $100,000 from the appellant if they could not recover them from Armstrong. And it is a rather singular fact, which remains unexplained, that no condemnation is asked by the Crown against Arm-strong in this case. If consideration was given to Thorn or to the company by Armstrong for the payment of these $175,000 to him by the Crown for the company, the case is at an end. What Armstrong did with the money, whether he spent it illegally or repaid it to appellant for an immoral consideration, assuming that to be so, cannot give to the company, and still less to the Crown the right to recover it back from him, Armstrong, and a fortiori not from the appellant if it was due or if consideration was given by Armstrong for it.\nNow the onus probandi was on the Crown. It had to prove that these $100,000 were not due to Armstrong, and that it had paid them through error, upon false representations. And on the present issue with appellant more especially the proof of these facts had to be clear, positive and convincing. The Crown's demand is based on a negative allegation, the allegation that nothing was due to Armstrong ; the establishment of that negative is an essential element of their case. Appellant could not be expected to have to prove that Armstrong's claim was a legitimate one. Then the Crown had to prove not only that it was a fictitious one, but also that appellant knew that it was a fictitious one. Now the Crown has failed on both these points. As to Armstrong's claim there is abundant evidence and what should in this issue between the Crown and the appellant be taken as conclusive evidence, that it was a just one. He repeatedly himself swears to its accuracy, and his evidence is unimpeached. It seems to have been given fairly and frankly. It is, moreover, certified for a large portion thereof by Leduc, his engineer, and by Light, the company's engineer and inspector for the local Government, who by Armstrong's contract with the company was stipulated to be the sole judge of the quality and the quantity of the work done. It is moreover admitted as correct by the managing director and the secretary of the old company whose contractor he was. What more could the Government require, as Mr. Garneau, the Commissioner of Public Works, says in his evidence, than these certificates and the admission of the company itself, coupled with the admission of Thorn himself, for the new syndicate as to $175,000 thereof that the claim filed was a correct and legitimate one, at least to that amount ? It is true that it was not cash but bonds only that Armstrong had then a right to demand according to his contract, and that the whole was not then exigible ; but it was a compromise, a new contract virtually that intervened between him and Thorn with the consent of the old syndicate or company. In consideration of these $175,000 he signed the following document : I, Charles N. Armstrong contractor for the construction of the Baie des Chaleurs Railway, do hereby grant a full and complete discharge and quittance to the Baie des Chaleurs Railway Company of all and every claim, of whatsoever nature and kind, that I have or may have against the said company ; and I further agree to cancel and annul and I do hereby cancel and annul the contract and agreement entered into with the said company on the 9th day of June, 1886, for the construction of the said railway. I hereby authorize the said company to take possession of the works on the said rail-way and all materials provided for the construction of the line, together with all the rolling stock placed on the line in furtherance of the provisions of said contract of the 9th June, 1886. And I further transfer, assign and make over to the said company, all and every claim which I have or may have against Henry MacFarlane & Son, and the said company is hereby authorized to use my name in enforcing or collecting such claim.\nSigned at Quebec, this 28th day of April, 1891.\nC. N. ARMSTRONG.\nIf he had not agreed to accept these $175,000 for his claim, the whole of these negotiations would have failed, and the company would most probably have been put into liquidation. He gave up all claim against the company under his contract ; he gave up not only his contract itself but also the possession of the railway, of the rolling stock and of the construction materials and plant on the ground ; he further assigned to the company a claim he had against the Macfarlane\u2019s. It cannot therefore be contended that this sum of $175,000 was paid to him without consideration even if it was paid to buy him out, to use his own expression. And even if paid before it was due it cannot be recovered under the express terms of Art. 1090 of the Civil Code. But, in fact, by mutually putting an end to the contract, what was due thereunder became unconditionally immediately exigible. It was moreover, one of the express conditions of his so giving up his contract that he be paid these $175,000 immediately. He was master of the situation ; he had or his sub-contractors had, de facto possession of the road ; lie had the contract It was only upon payment of these $175,000 as a compromise that the new company could succeed in going on with the enterprise, as it appears by the evidence they satisfactorily did soon thereafter. And the company never complained that they had paid too much for that compromise. How can the Crown be admitted to complain of it? It is true that Armstrong would have taken $75,000 for his claim in 1890 but that is satisfactorily explained in his evidence and in Thorn's evidence. Rather than lose everything as he then had to fear he would have taken that amount or perhaps less. But as the company had since been granted an additional subsidy of $280,000, he positively refused thereafter to be satisfied with $75,000. The fact that his claim was not filed in the Department of Public Works before it was filed with Langelier has been insisted upon on the part of the Crown as a suspicious one. But that is also satisfactorily explained. Armstrong had no claim whatever against the Government. It was with the company and the company alone that he had contracted, and he had duly filed his claim in the office of the secretary of the company. He could not reasonably be expected to file his claim with the Government when the Government owed him nothing. It had all along the previous negotiations in 1890 been known that he had a claim against the company which had to be settled some way or another before any attempt to reorganize the company and put it in a sound financial position could be expected to succeed.\nIt has been urged, though but faintly, on the part of the Crown, that Armstrong's claim was not a privileged claim under the terms of the statute granting the $280,000 subsidy, 54 Vict. ch. 88. But Thorn or the company, the interested parties, do not attack this payment, and such a ground more specially cannot be invoked by the Crown against this appellant in an action of this nature. Then Armstrong had possession of the road and the right of retention. That constituted a privilege ; and it was so treated as a privileged claim by Thorn himself, by the Government special commissioner, Langelier, and by the Commissioner of Public Works. How could the appellant have been expected to know that this was not a privileged claim, assuming that to be so ? How could he be expected to make an investigation of the matter ? Then by the order-in-council no. 237, the Government was bound to pay out of the subsidy the actual debts not only the privileged debts of the company, as Thorn had proposed. The contention by the respondent that the acts of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council are to be assimilated to the acts of a subordinate officer who cannot exceed his mandate are totally unfounded. The acts of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council are the acts of the Crown. However in this case, this point does not necessarily come up for adjudication. The expression, a actual debts,\" clearly included the privileged debts, and the order-in-council is supported by the statute. Then, by the statute, these payments had to be made to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, and the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, through Langelier, its commissioner specially authorized to determine which were and which were not privileged, treated Armstrong's claim as a privileged one.\nThen it is not as a condition precedent nor necessarily out of the subsidy that, by the statute, the privileged debts of the company were to be paid. The subsidy could legally have been paid to the company upon condition, the performance of which guaranteed to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, that these debts were to be thereafter paid. We have been asked on the part of the Crown to read subsection (j) of the statute ([10]) as if the words \" out of the said subsidy'' were in it after the word u paid \" but there is nothing in the statute that would justify this being done.\nMoreover there is no allegation whatever in the information that there were at that time other outstanding claims against the company privileged or not privileged.\nIt has further been urged on the part of the Crown that the conversion into cash of the land subsidy granted by 54 Vict. ch. 88, was not authorized by the statute. But there is nothing in that contention, could the Crown lawfully avail itself of the objection in this case against the present appellant. That statute, section 7, authorizes the conversion and, it is obvious, necessarily authorized it as regards the creditors of the company, without requiring any previous formality whatever.\nIf the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council ordered that the creditors privileged and not privileged were to be paid by the Government out of this subsidy, as it could be done and has been done in this case, before any part of it was paid to the company ([11]), then the conversion of the land grant into cash was in that case necessarily implied by the statute to have been provided for, at least to the amount of their claims, as it was cash, not land, with which the Legislature must have intended them to be paid. The resolution of the directors required by the said statute could not be required in such a case. Then this might be an objection on the part of the company, but it is not one open to the Crown, after having paid the money knowingly without asking for such a resolution. And the company, a party to this case, never took this or any objection whatever against this payment to Armstrong, and never could have taken it, as it was made with their consent and by their order.\nThere is another obstacle to the respondent's demand, which Armstrong could have successfully invoked had it been instituted against him and which, therefore, is available to the appellant. The payment was a direct one to Armstrong, as conceded by paragraph 37 of the information. It was a payment for and in the name of the company in satisfaction of the company's debt, with the company's assent. In fact, the warrant is \" to pay or cause to be paid unto the Baje des Chaleurs Railway,\" to be taken from 40 Vict. ch. 2 \"An Act Respecting the Consolidated Railway Fund.\" This payment made with the company's assent is a discharge to the Government pro tanto towards the company of the subsidy granted to the company in 1890. It is so much less that the company can expect to receive from the Government. If since the company has not fulfilled its obligations, that is a matter which does not concern Armstrong, still less the appellant. If the Government had given that money to Thorn for the company, and Thorn had repaid it over to Armstrong, it is the company alone who could recover it back, if any one could, not the Crown. \"Who would benefit by it if the Crown succeeded in this case ? Evidently the company and the company alone. Whose monies did the Crown pay to Armstrong? The company's money, the money voted to the company. Thorn's approval of Armstrong's claim for $175,000 was equivalent to an order on the Government to pay so much to Armstrong out of the grant by the Legislature, in satisfaction of the company's indebtedness to him (Armstrong), with the company's assent. The Crown, therefore, has no right to this action, even if the facts established any liability whatever by Armstrong or the appellant.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the Crown could, not have recovered these $100,000 from. Armstrong\", and that, consequently, they cannot be recovered from the appellant.\nBut even if the Crown was in a position to recover from Armstrong, it does not follow that it can recover against the appellant. One of the essential conditions required to enable the Crown to maintain its demand against the appellant is that he, the appellant, knew, assuming it to he so, that Armstrong had no right to these $100,000, or to any part thereof. Now there is not the least ground for that contention in the whole record. And how could he have any but the sincere conviction that the company was indebted to Armstrong, when not only did Armstrong himself always assert it, and it was conceded by every one to appellant's knowledge in all the previous negotiations that had taken place to re-form the company but also when he had before him not only the engineers' certificates and the confession of judgment, as it were, by the officers of the old company, for a much larger amount than the one compromised for but also Thorn's acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the claim up to $1750000, an acknowledgment acquiesced in and never complained of by the new company he represented. The fact that his agreement to get $100,000 was kept secret cannot be taken by itself as evidence of fraud When fraud is charged, it has to be proved, and proved clearly. Suspicions will not do.\nIt is true that Mr. Garneau, the commissioner of public works swears that if he had known that the appellant was to get anything out of these $175,000 Armstrong would not have had a cent. But that is obviously a voluntary statement made by the witness before the Royal Commission with a political object, or to emphasize his repudiation of any dishonourable conduct whatever on his part in the whole transaction. In law, if the money was due to Armstrong, it had to be paid to him whether the commissioner knew or not that he was to spend it illegally or immorally, or to give it or throw it away. And what Mr. Garneau says only tends to prove that the interests of the railway required the secrecy of this agreement between Armstrong and the appellant.\nThe allegations of the information as to deception, circumvention, bribery, immorality and undue influence in the negotiations with the Government, of either the company or Thorn or Armstrong and the appellant as his agent, are not made out in the case. There is nothing in this record to cast any doubt upon the statement of the Commissioner of Public Works when he swears that everything was done honestly, openly and regularly.\nAs to this agreement for $100,000 between the appellant and Armstrong, it is certainly an extraordinary one. No doubt the appellant performed some services for Armstrong and was entitled to some remuneration therefor. And there is nothing to find fault with in the fact that Armstrong, who lived in Montreal, employed an agent in Quebec to transact his business with the Government in Quebec and paid for hisservies. Neither was he guilty of any improper conduct because he chose as such a friend of the Ministers and a supporter of the Government, and gave him an interest as one of the promoters of the enterprise. If any one in his position wishes to employ an agent, he is not obliged as evidence of the honesty of his claim to resort to an adversary of the Government or to a personal enemy of the officials to be dealt with. Influence should not be required, it is true, to procure the payment by the Government of an honest claim ; but, if one requires more than usual promptness in the matter, the use of legitimate influence with the officials to procure it does not justify accusations of a nature to throw discredit on the whole country, Evidently Armstrong thought that if he did not succeed in getting up a new syndicate and obtain then a settlement of his claim, he was in immediate danger of irretrievably losing everything\". No time, he had reason to think, was to be lost. The act then recently passed empowering the Government to revoke at will the charter of the company was hanging as a heavy cloud over the whole business. There might at any time intervene a political crisis and a change in the Government with an entire change of policy as to subsidies to these companies. Then other parties unfriendly to him might at any moment offer to organize a syndicate and take up the charter. Thorn himself, unable as he was to take up the charter unless Armstrong's claim was settled, threatened that if the Government did not settle it without delay he would give up the transaction. The forty days delay fixed by his agreement with the old shareholders for the necessary assignment of their rights and of the charter were very soon to expire when the order-in-council was passed. There were only five days left. Evidently, he and the appellant as his agent were justified in pressing the matter and employing all the legitimate influence they could obtain to hasten a final settlement.\nThe amount the appellant received is, however, altogether out of proportion to his services. But that is a matter entirely between himself and Armstrong. It does not in the least concern the Crown. It is a dealing that leads to suspicion, no doubt, but all suspicion is dispelled as against the Crown's demand in this case by the evidence adduced ; 1st that Armstrong's claim was a legitimate one ; 2nd, that were there now, or had there been at any time since, any room for doubt on that first point the appellant had no reason whatever then to doubt that it was a legitimate one.\nI would allow the appeal with costs and dismiss the action with costs. Such is the unanimous judgment of the court.\nSedgewick and King JJ.

Est-il bien vrai qu'il n'\u00e9tait rien d\u00fb \u00e0 Armstrong? ii est prouv\u00e9 par le t\u00e9moin Macfarlane, entendu dans la cause, qu'Armstrong avait fait des travaux consid\u00e9rables sur la ligne du chemin de fer, dont ii ne pent estimer le montant Il est difficile d'en fixer la valeur sans examiner toute Ia preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite devant la Commission Royale et qui forme un volume d'au del\u00e0 de 1000 pages. Armstrong demandait $298,943.22 certifi\u00e9es comme dues, suivant les stipulations du contrat, par l'ing\u00e9nieur de la compagnie, agissant en m\u00eame temps comme le surintendant du gouvernement, et aussi par l'ing\u00e9nieur des contracteurs, le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier et le directeur-g\u00e9rant de la compagnie. L'ing\u00e9nieur de la compagnie jure devant la Commission que le compte d'Armstrong \u00e9tait exag\u00e9r\u00e9 de 50 par 100, et qu'il ne l'avait approuv\u00e9 que sur les representations du pr\u00e9sident Mais alors il lui \u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement d\u00fb pr\u00e9s de $150,000, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement plus que les $100,000 demand\u00e9es. Le gouvernement paya plus que cette somme \u00e0 Armstrong, ou \u00e0 d'autres pour son compte, dont ii ne demande pas la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, bien que payee en vertu du m\u00eame ordre en conseil et par suite des m\u00eames man\u0153uvres. Thom avait vu la reclamation d'Armstrong an bureau des Travaux Publics \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec le ou vers le 23 avril 1891. Il croyait qu'elle \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e, au moins en partie, et apr\u00e9s l'avoir v\u00e9rifi\u00e9e par l'examen des certificats de l'ing\u00e9nieur et avoir consult\u00e9 M. Cooper, le plus fort actionnaire de la nouvelle compagnie qui succ\u00e9dait \u00e0 l'ancienne, il l'approuva jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de Ia somme de $175,000.\nL'intim\u00e9e pretend que ce qui \u00e9tait alors d\u00fb \u00e0 Armstrong n'\u00e9tait pas exigible et d\u00e9pendait d'une condition suspensive, savoir, le parach\u00e8vement du chemin de fer. Mais le contrat declare en termes formels que si les subsides en terres \u00e9taient convertis en agent Armstrong \" shall be paid and receive the said cash.\" C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce qui eut lieu en vertu d'actes de la legislature.\nEnfin la demande est sans preuve, si l'on \u00e9carte le dossier de la Commission Royale, produit dans cette cause du consentement des parties et d\u00e9clarant qu'il\nshall avail as evidence in the present cause in the same manner as though the several depositions has been taken and sworn herein and as though the several Exhibits had been filed herein ; all copies of authentic instruments as printed therein shall avail as though authentic and other Exhibits to the extent to which the same may he proved by the said deposition.\nL'autorisation du tribunal ne fut pas m\u00eame demand\u00e9e contrairement \u00e0 l'article 319 du Code de Procedure.\nLe Code de Procedure donne bien aux parties le pouvoir d'examiner leurs t\u00e9moins de consentement, devant le protonotaire, on un commissaire ; mais il a fallu l'intervention de la legislature. Pinsonnault v. Valade. ([13]) C. P.C. Art. 255, 285 ; 33 Vict., c. 18. Egalement il a fallu un texte de loi pour leur permettre de proc\u00e9der de consentement \u00e0 1a preuve au long. C. P. C. Art. 284. L'Article 25 indique comment on peut transmettre un dossier d'une cour \u00e0 une autre et ajoute que cette transmission pent se faire de toute autre mani\u00e8re du consentement des parties. Dans des circonstances sp\u00e9ciales, un juge peut bien accepter la preuve faite dans une autre cause, avec on sans le consentement des parties ; mais je ne sache pas qu'il puisse admettre une preuve prise en dehors des tribunaux. Tontes ces exceptions \u00e9tablissent que la regle gen\u00e9rale promulgu\u00e9e par le Code de Procedure, art. 263\u2014que Ia preuve doit \u00eatre faite en justice\u2014est d'ordre public et qu'il n'est pas permis d'y d\u00e9roger par des consentements. Carr\u00e9, Lois de La Proc\u00e9dure civile, (3e, \u00e9d.,) t. ler, p.

Under the Act of 1894 a copy of the registry of a ship registered in Liverpool, certified by the Registrar General of Shipping at London is sufficient proof of ownership.\nQu\u0153re.\u2014Where the Merchants' Shipping Act of 1854 provides that every order of two justices in an action for seaman's wages shall be final, will certiorari lie to remove the proceedings into a Superior Court?\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick making absolute a rule nisi for certiorari to remove the proceedings before the Police Magistrate of St. John with a view to having the order made therein quashed.\nThe action was brought by the Imperial Board of Trade to recover the amount paid for hospital fees and board at Hong Kong on account of a seaman on board a ship of the defendant who was injured and left at Hong Kong, and also the expenses of carrying the seaman to London.\nThe questions raised on the appeal were:\n1. Did an appeal lie when the order of the magistrate was neither quashed nor affirmed on certiorari?\n2. Defendant having become owner of said ship after the expenses were incurred was it an \"owner for the time being\" under sec. 213 of The Merchants' Shipping Act, 1854?\n3. Was the payment of said expenses by the Board of Trade properly proved by a certificate of the assistant secretary?\n4. Was the ownership of the vessel proved by a copy of the registry certified by the Registrar General at London?\n5. Did certiorari lie to remove the proceedings before the magistrate whose order is made final by the Act?\nThe certificates in evidence are set out in the judgment of the court.\nThe Supreme Court of New Brunswick held that the ownership of the vessel was not proved and gave judgment for defendant on that ground. The Crown appealed.\nNewcombe Q.C. (Deputy Minister of Justice) for the Crown. The Merchants' Shipping Act of 1894 is the governing enactment in this case and the 64th and 695th sections are complete statutory authority for proof of ownership of the vessel in the manner here adopted. The position is not the less clear if we are to rely upon the previous legislation under which the Supreme Court of New Brunswick dealt with the question. The court did not refer to section 15 of the Merchants' Shipping Act Amendment Act, 1855,[1] which provides, (sec. 1,) that that Act shall be taken to be part of the Merchants' Shipping Act, 1854,[2] and shall be construed accordingly. The copy or transcript certified by the Registrar General might therefore have been properly admitted under the combined effect of sections 107 of the Act of 1854 and section 15 of the Act of 1855. If necessary, also, sections 14 and 11 of the law of Evidence Amendment Act, 1851,[3] may be called in aid. If not admissible upon other grounds, then the copy or transcript kept by the Registrar General is a document to which section 14 applies and it has the same effect as the original under section 64 of the Merchants' Shipping Act of 1894[4]. See also the Canada Evidence Act, 1893, secs. 13 and 14[5].\nAs to the certificate of the Assistant Secretary of the Board of Trade as to the payment of expenses, sec. 208, ss. 1 and 3 of the Merchants' Shipping Act, 1894, in effect provide that if the expenses referred to in the section are paid by any British consular officer or \"other person on behalf of the Crown\" then in any proceeding for recovery a certificate signed by the consular officer or \"other person\" shall be sufficient proof that the expenses were duly paid by that officer or \"other person.\" The words \"other person\" are very wide' and seem intended to provide for various possible stages. The Board of Trade is the government department which ultimately bears the expenses on behalf of the Crown, and obviously the Board is the body, or its proper officer is the person to certify the fact. Sections 695 and 719 of the Merchants' Shipping Act, 1894, (sec. 7 of the Act of 1854) come in aid of section 208 (3) if required. The shipping master at Hong Kong could not certify the whole expenditure, but only that which he himself incurred and paid. Necessarily there have been other expenses paid by the Board of Trade which were not incurred at Hong Kong so that the Board is the only body, or its officer is the only person who can certify the full amount. The Legislature cannot have intended that a British consular officer or shipping master in a colonial port should always prepay the conveyance and subsistence money under ss. 228-9, of the Merchants' Shipping Act, 1854. That is too narrow a construction, and one which is not required by the wording of those sections, or sections 207-8 of the Act of 1894 in which they are reproduced. The certificate of the Board of Trade which had first inquired into and satisfied itself of the propriety of the expenditure is really the best evidence and, in this case, the only certificate which the statute contemplates.\nAs to the point that the action could not be maintained against the company inasmuch as it had acquired ownership after the expenses were incurred, section 208 of the Merchants' Shipping Act, 1894, charges the expenses upon the ship to be recovered from the owner for the time being as a debt to the Crown. This obviously refers to the owner at the time proceedings are taken, the only construction consistent with the expenses being constituted a charge upon the ship. The wording of the section seems quite inappropriate to the proposition that the owner for the time being means the owner at the time when the expenses are incurred. Arrow Shipping Co. v. Tyne Improvement Commissioners[6].\nThe judgment of the police court having been made final by statute could not be reviewed upon certiorari except for want of jurisdiction or on the ground of fraud. The writ was allowed upon the ground that the evidence was insufficient, but the court has no jurisdiction to review the judgment upon certiorari on any such ground.

We refer also to Hespeler v. Shaw[12]; In re Trepanier[13]; The Queen v. Ambrose and Winslow[14]; The Queen v. Coulson[15]; The Queen v. Scott[16]; and Royal Insurance Co. v. Duffus[17].\nA. L. Palmer Q.C. for the respondent. The extracts or copies of transcripts, etc., were not certified in accordance with the 107th and 229th sections of the Merchants' Shipping Act of 1854. The copy or extract of transcript is not a certificate of registry or an examined copy thereof, or a copy thereof purporting to be certified under the hands of the registrar, or person having charge of the original; the same is, and professes to be, a copy of a transcript or copy, which has been transmitted by the Registrar, or other persons having charge of the same, at Liverpool, to the Registrar General of Shipping and Seamen at London. The statute under consideration, and the Evidence Act of New Brunswick[18], make provision for the reception in evidence of a copy certified by the official having charge of the original, but there is no provision for a certificate such as the one given. The other certificate of Cosmo Monthouse or documents produced before the police magistrate are not a certificate within the meaning of the 229th section of the Act; that section requires the certificate of the consular officer, or other person on behalf of Her Majesty, who makes the payment. It would be a manifest injustice and an absurdity to allow an officer in the office in London, to issue certificates with reference to payments made by consular officers, and the other persons named in the Act at the various ports and places throughout the world where ships of Her Majesty's subjects trade. The Act contemplates that the owner of the ship, when called upon to repay expenses, should have the certificate of the consular officer or other person who has actually made the disbursement on account of the alleged distressed seamen, at the place and at the time when he was so in distress, and not a mere statement from some official of the Board of Trade in London that the Board of Trade had paid the money to some person, without any certificate from such person that the money had been properly expended.\nIt appears that the alleged expenses were all incur red long before the respondent was incorporated or became owner of the ship, and even if the papers produced are sufficient, judgment could only be entered against the former owners. The 229th section of the Merchants' Shipping Act are clearly words of limitation; first, because that is their ordinary and grammatical meaning; secondly, because any other interpretation of them will cast a liability in the nature of contract upon a person who at the time of the arising of the liability under the contract was nonexistent. It would be absurd to hold that a company incorporated in 1892, under an Act of the legislature of New Brunswick, is liable for acts and happenings in Hong Kong and London in 1891. All liability under the Merchants' Shipping Act is based upon actual or supposed contract or agreement between existing parties.\nThe judgment is declared to be final as to matters of fact, but this declaration cannot affect matters of law which go to the jurisdiction; Paley, p. 424. The defect in the convicting court here is that it had not power to inquire into the matter before it. The case of Hespeler v. Shaw[19] carries out this same principle, and certiorari is the correct and only remedy in the case. The stricter and narrower rules of evidence laid down in the Act of 1854 are saved by the Act of 1894 and they apply here. See the Interpretation Act of 1889 as to the effect of repeals and sec. 745 of the Merchants' Shipping Act, 1894. Consequently the certificates, transcripts or copies produced cannot make evidence, nor could there be jurisdiction in the police magistrate; see sec 188 of the Merchants' Shipping Act, 1854.\nKING J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick making absolute a rule nisi for a certiorari to remove, (with a view of quashing,) a judgment rendered in the Police Court of the City of St. John, for the Queen, in the sum of $58.65, and all proceedings upon which such judgment is based.\nThe action was brought by the Imperial Board of Trade in the name of Her Majesty to recover hospital fees and board at Hong Kong, and expenses of conveyance to London of Carl Silstrom, a seaman on board the ship Troop, who had sustained injuries in the service of the vessel, and who was discharged and left behind by the master in the year 1891.\nSection 213 of the Merchants Shipping Act, 1854, enacts that:\nIf any seaman * * * belonging to any British ship is discharged or left behind at any place out of the United Kingdom without full compliance on the part of the master with all the provisions in that behalf in this Act contained, and becomes distressed and is relieved under the provisions of this Act * * \" the wages (if any) due to such seaman * * * and all expenses incurred for his subsistence, necessary clothing, conveyance home, burial, etc., shall be a charge upon the ship whether British or foreign, to which he so belonged as aforesaid, and the Board of Trade may in the name of Her Majesty (besides suing for any penalties which may have been incurred), sue for and recover the said wages and expenses with costs either from the master of such ship as aforesaid, or from the person who is the owner thereof for the time being or, in the case of such engagement as aforesaid for service in a foreign ship, from such master or owner, or from the person by whom such engagement was so [Illegible text] as aforesaid; and such sums shall be recoverable either in the same manner as other debts due to Her Majesty, or in the same manner and by the same form and process in which wages due to the seaman would be recoverable by him; and in any proceedings for that purpose production of the account (if any) to be furnished as hereinbefore is provided in such cases, together with proof of payment by the Board of Trade or by the Paymaster General of the charges incurred on account of any such seaman, * * shall be sufficient evidence that he was relieved, conveyed home, for buried (as the case may be), at Her Majesty's expense.\nSection 229 provides that:\nIf any such expenses in respect of the illness, injury or hurt of any seaman or apprentice as are to be borne by the owner are paid by any consular officer or other person on behalf of Her Majesty * * such expenses shall be repaid to such officer or other person by the master of the ship, and if not so repaid the amount thereof with costs shall be a charge upon the ship and be recoverable from the master or owner of the ship for the time being as a debt due to Her Majesty, and shall be recoverable either by ordinary process of law or in the manner in which seamen are hereby enabled to recover wages; and in any proceeding for the recovery thereof the production of a certificate of the facts signed by such officer or other person, together with such vouchers (if any), as the case requires, shall be sufficient proof that the said expenses were duly paid by such consular officer or other person as aforesaid.\nThe provisions of the statute as to the recovery of seamen's wages are, so far as material, as follows: Section 188:\nAny seaman may * * sue in a summary manner before any two justices of the peace acting in or near to the place at which the service has terminated, or at which the seamen * * has been discharged, or at which any person upon whom the claim is made is or resides * * for any amount of wages due to such seaman * * not exceeding \u00a350 over and above the costs of any proceeding for the recovery thereof, so soon as the same becomes payable, and every order made by such justices * * in the matter shall be final.\nBy sec. 519 it is declared that\nAny stipendiary magistrate shall have full power to do alone whatever two justices of the peace are by this Act authorized to do.\nThe defendant company, a corporation incorporated by the laws of New Brunswick, has its principal place of business at Rothesay, in New Brunswick, a place near to the City of St. John, N.B., and Robert J. Ritchie,. Esq., who exercised the functions of the Police Court in the proceedings in question, was a stipendary magistrate in the City of St. John, and in these proceedings was acting as such.\nThe evidence adduced to prove the ownership of the Troop by the defendant company was a document certified by the Registrar General of Shipping, in London, England. It embraced (first), a transcript of register for transmission to the Registrar General of Shipping and Seamen. (Secondly), a copy of transactions subsequent to registry showing the vesting of the entire ownership in the defendant company in March, 1892, with a statement of ownership and encumbrances after such registration by which it appeared that the defendant company were the sole owners down to the date of the following certificate:\nI hereby certify that the foregoing particulars of the registry and present ownership and interest of the Troop, official number 87977 have been truly extracted from the records in my charge.\n(Sgd.) J. CLARK HALL.\nRegistrar General.\nGeneral Register and Record Office of\nShipping and Seamen, Customs House,\nLondon, E., 24th January, 1897.\nThen, in proof of payment, there was the following certificate of an assistant secretary of the Board of Trade.\nIt is hereby certified that the Board of Trade have paid on behalf of Her Majesty the sum of \u00a312 ls 9d, being the amount of expenses incurred in the months of August, September, October and November, 1891, by the harbour master at Hong Kong, and the superintendent of the Mercantile Marine Office at Victoria docks, London, in the relief according to the provisions of the Merchants' Shipping Act of 1854, of Carl Silstrom, formerly of the ship Troop, distressed British seaman. And it is further certified that the documents hereunto annexed and marked B. C. and D. are the original signed receipts which include the payments making up the said sum of \u00ab\u00a312 Is 9d. And it is further certified that this certificate is issued by the Board of Trade under the provisions of the Merchants' Shipping Act of 1854.\n(Sgd.) COSMO MONTHOUSE,\nL.S.\nAn Assistant Secretary of the Board of Trade,\nLondon. Dated this 22nd of May, 1895.\nThe documents referred to in the certificate were put in evidence.\nIn the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, (as before the Police-Magistrate,) it was maintained by the defendants that these certificates were insufficient, and it was also contended that persons who became owners of the vessel after the transaction were not \"owners for the time being\" within the meaning of the Act. As to this last point the New Brunswick Supreme Court held that these words mean the owners at the time of action brought. This seems clearly so. The words import a fluctuating body of persons. They are not the determinate owners who made default but the owners for the time being, the words \"for the time being\" denoting not a time fixed by the transaction in question but one that is variable according to the happening of another event. Then, inasmuch as the debt is made a charge upon the vessel following and binding her even on change of ownership, and even when she has ceased to be a British and becomes a foreign ship, the evident intention is to make the personal liability co-extensive with this.\nThe Supreme Court of New Brunswick also held that there was sufficient proof of payment by the Board of Trade.\nUpon the remaining objection, however, they were with the defendant company, and held that the certificate of ownership was defective upon the ground that the Registrar General not being the person having charge of the original register (the vessel being registered at Liverpool) it was not competent for him to give a certificate sufficient under the Act; and upon this ground the rule was made absolute.\nIn the argument of the appeal Mr. Palmer, for the respondents, contended that an appeal does not lie in a case of certiorari except from a judgment ordering the quashing (or otherwise) of the judgment or order of the inferior court.\nBy force of the Act of 1891 (read in conjunction with the principal Act R. S. C. ch. 135), an appeal lies from the judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or prohibition not arising out of a criminal charge.\nA judgment in a case of proceedings for a writ of certiorari in proceedings such as these seems, therefore, in explicit terms to be within the Act.\nThe practice in certiorari in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick is similar to that expressed in the following passage from Paley on Convictions, p. 434:\nIf a rule nisi only be granted in the first instance yet the argument on such rule generally decides the case and if it be made absolute after argument, the conviction is quashed almost as a matter of course when it is afterwards brought up on the certiorari.\nNext, as to the grounds of appeal. It is argued for the appellant that in a case where by statute the judgment of the inferior court is declared to be final, the effect is, not indeed to take away the right of certiorari, but to limit it to cases of the want, excess or defect of jurisdiction, or of fraud.\nIt is settled, in cases where no restraint is imposed by the legislature upon review by certiorari, that an adjudication by a tribunal having jurisdiction over the subject matter is, if no defects appear on the face of it, to be taken as conclusive of the facts stated therein, and that the Court of Queen's Bench will not on certiorari quash such an adjudication on the ground that any such fact, however essential, has been erroneously found. It has been also settled that even where the right is taken away by statute it is to be deemed as still existent in cases of want or excess of jurisdiction or fraud. In the case of Colonial Bank of Australasia v. Willan[20] there is a discussion of the various conditions which may be said to determine the jurisdiction of tribunals of limited jurisdiction. A marked distinction exists between the merits of the case and points collateral to the merits upon which the limit to jurisdiction depends. In the former, it is conceived that, where by statute the adjudication is final, no mere error of the tribunal whether as to law or fact involved in such determination, can suffice to make the adjudication open to review upon certiorari.\nTreating the matter otherwise, however, and without formally deciding it, it would appear that there was a sufficiency of evidence to warrant the conclusions of the police magistrate.\nFirst, as to the evidence of ownership, sec. 15 of the Merchants' Shipping Amendment Act, 1855, declares that the copy or transcript of the register of any British ship which is kept by the Chief Registrar of Shipping at the Customs House in London or by the Registrar General of Seamen under the direction of Her Majesty's Commissioners of Customs, or of the Board of Trade, shall have the same effect to all intents and purposes as the original register of which the same is a copy or transcript. What, therefore, the custodian of the original register might certify under sec. 107 of the Act of 1854, the registrar general may certify under the same section, by force of sec 15 of the Act of 1855.\nBy the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, the prior Acts alluded to were repealed, and by one provision of the new Act, the returns transmitted by the local registrars to the registrar general are declared to constitute the register of British ships, and by sec. 64 it is enacted that a copy or transcript of the register of British ships kept by the registrar general\nshall be admissible in evidence in manner provided by this Act and have the same effect to all intents as the original register of which it is a copy or transcript.\nBy sec. 695 it is provided that a copy of any such document as is by the Act declared to be admissible in evidence, or an extract therefrom, shall be admissible in evidence, if it purports to be signed and certified as a true copy or extract by the officer to whose custody the original document was entrusted. By the expression \"original document,\" is manifestly meant the document previously referred to as that which by the Act is made admissible in evidence, and the expression is used as in contradistinction to the copy or extract of which it is the original. Naturally the person capable of certifying to a copy of or extract from a particular document would be the person having custody of such document, and not a person having custody of an original of such \"original document.\"\nMr. Palmer met this argument by referring to the clause of the Interpretation Act of 1889, by which it is enacted that the repeal of an Act shall not affect any suit, proceeding or remedy under the repealed Act, and argued that the remedy would be affected if a new statutory mode of proof were admitted. If the new provision related to matters the proof of which was provided for in the provisions of the repealed Act establishing the remedy, the effect might perhaps be as contended for, but independent and general provisions as to proof contained in the later Act would seem to be prim\u00e2 facie applicable to all cases where such proof has to be made.\nNext, as to the evidence of payment; the difficulty arises from the fact that section 213 of the Act of 1854 which empowers the Board of Trade to sue for and recover the expenses in the name of Her Majesty, and which declares the effect of proof of payment by the Board of Trade, does not provide for a mode of such proof by certificate. The form of the certificate rather leads to the conclusion that the Board of Trade was advised that such a certificate could be given under section 7 of the Act of 1854. The Supreme Court of New Brunswick, however, find a warrant for it under section 229, by treating the Board of Trade as a person making the payment on behalf of Her Majesty. In this case the vouchers show that the account for the hospital fees, (the largest item in the claim,) was made in terms against the Board of Trade. I do not think it is any straining of the statute to read it as the Supreme Court of New Brunswick have done, for manifestly the Board of Trade is the real paymaster by whosesoever hands the money may have passed.\nA question was raised as to the jurisdiction of the Police Court. But the facts and references already stated show that the Stipendiary Magistrate of St. John had jurisdiction to entertain a claim for wages against the defendant company, and indeed the question was not raised in the court below.\nThe appeal, therefore, should be allowed. The proper order below was to discharge the rule nisi for a certiorari.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. L. Newcombe.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C. A.

The resolution provided that a portion of the expense should be paid by the parties interested and benefited as for local improvements made by the \u201cwidening \" of Beaudry street. Upon proceedings to quash the assessment, the Superior Court held that it was authorized and legalized as an \"existing roll,\" by the Act, 57 Vict. ch. 57, s. 1, (Que.), and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Review\nHeld, reversing the decision of both courts below that notwithstanding the reference therein to e existing rolls \", the application of the latter Act should be restricted to the cost of the \"widening\" only of the streets therein named in cases where there were at the time of its enactment, existing rolls prepared by the commissioners fixing the limits for that purpose and these words could not have the effect of extending the nature and character of such works so as to include works manifestly forming part of the harbour improvement scheme and chargeable against the special loan.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada, sitting in review, at Montreal, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which dismissed the petition of the appellant to quash an assessment roll imposing a special tax upon his lands in connection with certain expropriation proceedings and local improvements in the City of Montreal.\nThe petitioner contested the assessment substantially on the ground that part of the works were not, as contended, for the widening of the street upon which his property was situated, hut were actually part of works in connection with the Montreal harbour improvements, the expenses of which ought to have been defrayed from funds appropriated therefor out of a special loan under a city by-law founded upon the Quebec statute, 52 Vict. ch. 79 sec. 139.\nThe facts of the case are stated in the judgment of the court delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nTrenholme Q.C. and Be\u00efque Q.C. for the appellant. The resolution of April 13th, 1891, so far as it attempts to authorize a special assessment, is illegal. The statute 57 Vict. ch. 57 does not apply to the expropriations and works in question. The Act only applies to widening in cases where there might be e existing rolls \u201cat the time of the enactment. It cannot apply to openings, nor to the tunnel, nor to the o open-cut approach,\" nor the high-level roadway \u201cwhich were all part of the scheme for harbour improvements. See Joseph v. City of Montreal ([1]).\nAtwater Q.C. and Ethier Q.C. for the respondent on the 16th January, 1891, a number of proprietors, including appellant, presented, a petition for the prolongation of Beaudry street ; on the 13th day of April, 1891, the council, after having received reports on the petition from the roads and finance committees, resolved that Beaudry street should be so opened at a width of 77 feet as shown on the plan ; that the land required should be expropriated, and the cost of opening said street to the line fixed upon, 42 feet borne by the parties interested in and to be benefited by the improvements, and the cost of the 35 feet extra required for the high-level road should be paid by the city out of the funds for harbour improvements. Afterwards, on the 30th of June, 1891, commissioners were appointed, and in the month of September, 1891, they reported fixing the limits of proprietors interested, and subsequently fixed the indemnities to be paid for land expropriated. In 1894 a projected roll of assessment was prepared, but subsequently discontinued, and finally the present assessment roll was prepared according to the special law then in force, 57 Vict. ch. 57, ss. 1 & 3 (Que.).\nThe commissioners, acting within their powers under section 3 set aside any distinction of tunnel or high-level roadway and, considering the improvements as a whole, divided the cost into two equal parts, the city being charged with the payment of one-half, and the other half assessed on the properties of the interested parties. Their report was duly advertised and afterwards signed by the commissioners on the 28th September 1891. This final roll was ratified by the commissioners on the 31st January, 1896, and on the 3rd of February of the same year the city treasurer gave public notice to the effect that he would precede to the collection of said roll.\nAll required formalities have been strictly complied with. The statute was fully applicable to the improvements thus made in the prolongation of Beaudry street and the second sentence Of sec. 1 is not confined to a \" widening \" of that street, but was passed with special reference to the whole cost of the prolongation under the plans and resolution. The provisions of this Act (57 Vict. ch. 57) are the only enactments applicable to the matter in dispute, and that Act authorizes the taxation of the interested parties benefited by the improvement.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The sole question involved in this appeal is whether or not an assessment made in the month of January, 1896, upon certain real estate situate on Craig street, in the City of Montreal, the property of the appellant, and upon the appellant as the owner thereof, whereby the appellant is charged with the sum of $3,596.74, by way of contribution to the purchase money of land situate on Craig street, of two several pieces of which the appellant was seized, and acquired by the City of Montreal, in the year 1891, is made legal and binding upon the appellant under, and by force of, the provisions of the Quebec statute, 57 Vict. ch. 57.\nThe facts upon which the solution of this question depends are as follows:\nBeaudry street in the year 1891 was and still is a street which extends from Sherbrooke street, in the City of Montreal, and after proceeding in a south-easterly direction crossing several streets parallel with Sherbrooke street, terminated at Craig street, which is a street parallel with Sherbrooke street. Now Beaudry street for the greater part of the above distance that is to say from Robin street the second street from Sherbrooke street, was only thirty-five feet in width down to Craig street where it terminated. From the opposite side of Craig street to Notre-Dame street which is the next street to Craig street and. parallel therewith there was no street whatever in existence on a line with Beaudry street ; all the land on that side of Craig street, opposite to Beaudry street, for a considerable distance along Craig street, was the property of the appellant, and was built upon. Notre-Dame street runs along the summit of a ridge 22 feet above the level of and about 330 feet distant from Craig street ; at the base of this ridge upon one side was Craig street and upon the other side but at a much greater distance from Notre-Dame street than is Craig street is a street called Commissioners street also parallel with Notre-Dame street or nearly so, and situate close to the water of the harbour of Montreal. From Notre-Dame street leading down to Commissioners street there was a street called Brock street, which was only 25 feet in width This street was within the lines of Beaudry street, assuming those lines to be drawn across Craig street and so in continuation across Notre-Dame street. In the year 1878 the Corporation of the City of Montreal had conceived the idea of widening at some future time Beaudry street to 42 feet and of making a street in continuation of it from Craig street to Notre-Dame street of the like width of 42 feet, and also of widening Brock street down to Commissioner street to the like width but all that contemplated work, if done, and when done, was to be done on the surface of the ground like all the other streets in the city, and a plan was prepared by the city of such contemplated work which plan was duly homologated in 1878, but the work so designed and shewn upon said homologated plan was never, (at least in so far as the space between Craig street and Notre-Dame street is concerned) carried into effect by the corporation, but instead thereof a wholly different work was undertaken by the city under the provisions of sections 139 of an .Act of the Province of Quebec passed on the 21st day of March, 1889, 52 Vict. c. 79, intituled u An Act to revise and consolidate the charter of the City of Montreal and the several Acts amending the same.\" By that 139th section of that Act it was enacted that:\nIf at any time the council shall determine to aid in the improvement of the harbour of Montreal either by contributing to works appertaining to the harbour and wharves or by opening or widening streets, ramps or tunnels adjacent or leading thereto, erecting or improving the dyke or otherwise, or in any or all of such methods, the council may by by-law declare and describe the nature of the intended aid and the amount to be therein expended not exceeding in the aggregate one million dollars and may thereby provide for the issue of bonds or debentures to the required amount, constituting a lien and charge upon the property and revenues of the city,\nas in the Act declared.\nUpon the 4th day of November, 1889, the corporation of the City of Montreal in virtue of the authority conferred by the above section passed a by-law no. 174 whereby, after reciting that it was deemed expedient in the interest of the City of Montreal it was enacted that the corporation of the city should effect a loan not exceeding one million dollars for the purpose of preventing inundations and for the amelioration of the harbour of the said city as specified in the following section. Then section 2 enacted that the product of the said loan should be applied in the following manner, that is to say:\n1. For constructing a permanent lev\u00e9e en face de la cit\u00e9..... $670,353 00\n2. For widening Commissioners street and la rue de la\nCommune. 129,647 00\nFor constructing a tunnel under Brock street 163,750 00\nFor aiding in the construction of a rampe \u00e0 la rue\nGale 23,000 00\n5 Interest and unforeseen expenses 13,250 00\nTotal $1,000,000 00\nThe whole as shewn on plans annexed to the by-law. Now by this by-law the whole of the work designated therein and as shown on the plans annexed thereto, (and no one part any more than another), is described as work undertaken in the interest of the whole city and which was therefore to be paid for wholly by the city, and primarily out of the million dollar loan authorised to be effected by section 139 of 52 Vict. ch. 79 and by the by-law of the city passed in pursuance thereof, no part of such work was chargeable to or could be charged against any particular persons who were owners of property supposed to derive some special benefit from such a public work so undertaken all the cost was chargeable to the fund specially provided by the statute and the by-law for the purpose.\nWe are only concerned with the work mentioned as the third item in the by-law by which the sum of $163750 was set apart and appropriated to the construction of a tunnel under Brock street. The land appropriated for this purpose by the plan annexed to the by-law in so far at least as the space between Craig street and Notre-Dame street, with which we are dealing, is concerned, consisted among other lands of two several pieces of land fronting on Craig street, the property of the appellant, one of which, measuring 42 feet in width on Craig street and directly opposite to Beaudry street, extended in the direction of Notre-Dame street across the property of the appellant, and the other measuring 35 feet in width, and immediately adjoining on the north-east side of the said piece of 42 feet in width extended in the direction of Notre-Dame street across the property of the appellant. These several pieces of land upon reaching the limit of the appellant's property entered upon the lands of other persons having their frontage on Notre-Dame street. The piece of land 42 feet in width proceeded from Craig street on a descending grade of one foot in 35 feet for the distance of about 238 feet from Craig street and about 80 feet beyond the limit of the appellant's property, and was appropriated, and in the actual construction of the Brock street tunnel used for the approach thereto, the portal whereof, about 20 feet in height is situate at said distance of about 238 feet from Craig street, from which point the tunnel is constructed under Notre-Dame street and Brock street down to the waters of the harbour The piece of land 35 feet in width, on the contrary, proceeded from Craig street on an ascending grade and reached about the level of Notre-Dame street at the top of the arch of the portal of the tunnel or at the distance of about 90 feet from Notre-Dame street and continued on to Notre-Dame street where it terminated These two pieces of land of the width of 42 feet and 35 feet respectively consisted of as separate and distinct roadways as if they were miles apart, for they not only were constructed on wholly different gradients and had each a wholly different terminus from the other one at the waters of the harbour which were reached by a subterranean route, and the other constructed on an ascending grade from Craig street to Notre-Dame street where, on the surface of the ground there it terminated, but they were separated from each other at their start from Craig street, and necessarily so separated, by a solid stone wall upwards of five feet in width ascending from Craig street to the height of the portal of the tunnel surmounted by a strong iron railing. The piece of land 35 feet in width would seem to have been designed and adopted as part of the tunnel work for the reason that as the whole of the roadway 42 feet in width which in 1878 the corporation had designed opening from Craig street to Notre- Dame street on the surface had been wholly diverted from that purpose by the section 139 of 52 Vict ch. 79, and the by-law it was but reasonable that surface access from Craig street to Notre-Dame-street should be furnished at the expense of the fund appropriated for the tunnel of which the piece 42 feet in width was a necessary part. However, whatever may have been the reason, it is, I think, clear beyond question that the roadway of 35 feet in width from Craig street to Notre-Dame street was part of the tunnel work as designed by the corporation and covered by the by-law. In the interval between the passing of the by-law and the month of January, 1891, a part of the appellant's buildings situate on Craig street was destroyed by fire and for that reason it seemed to several persons of whom the appellant was one, that the time was opportune for opening* the road from Craig street to Notre-Dame street, and they made a suggestion to that effect in a letter addressed to the chairman of a committee of the council called the road committee. The chairman having submitted the communication to the committee the latter made a report to the council thereon wherein they say that\nas it is a part of the harbour improvement scheme to have a subway at Brock, street they recommend\nthat Beaudry street be opened from Notre-Dame street to Craig street at a width of 77 feet as shown on a plan annexed to the report and that the land be expropriated, &c., &c., Now the 77 feet shown on this plan consists of no other than the two several pieces of 42 feet and 35 feet in width respectively as aforementioned appropriated and set apart by the by-law for the purposes of the tunnel. The road committee then in their report, with full knowledge and understanding of the Brock street tunnel scheme, proceed to recommend that the cost of the improvement he borne and paid as follows:\u2014the cost of opening the piece 42 feet in width by the parties interested in and to be benefited by the improvement and the cost of the extra 35 feet required for the high level road to be borne and paid by the city out of the fund for the harbour improvements.\nThe piece of land 42 feet in width having been as already shown appropriated by the by-law 174 to the purposes of the tunnel for the construction of which that by-law had set apart $163,750, it is difficult to understand upon what principle the road committee proceeded when they recommended that the cost of the improvement, in so far as the piece 42 feet in width was concerned, should be paid by parties interested therein and benefited by the improvement. They were certainly not proceeding in ignorance of the fact that the piece 42 feet in width was required for and was indispensably necessary for the construction of the tunnel for their report shows that the diversion of that piece of land from the ordinary purposes of a street to the purposes of a tunnel in the construction of which the whole of the city was by the by-law declared to be interested constituted their reason for recommending that the cost of the construction of the high level roadway should be charged to the fund provided for the construction of the tunnel.\nThis report, singular as it is in this form in view of the actual circumstances and facts of the case, was adopted by a resolution of the council on the 13th September, 1891, but it must, I think, he admitted as beyond all question that such resolution of the council had not and could not have the effect of charging the cost of the construction of any part of the improvement thereon which consists solely of the tunnel so far as it is on that piece of land or any part of the land acquired for the purpose of the tunnel to any other fund than that provided therefor by the by-law no. 174.\nIn the month of May, 1891, commissioners were appointed to value the land required to be taken by the city, and in the document submitting that question to them, the land between Craig street and Notre Dame was described in two several pieces of 42 feet and 35 feet in width respectively precisely as shown on the plan annexed to and adopted by the by-law no. 174, as that upon which the tunnel was to be constructed as part of the harbour improvements in which the whole city was interested.\nThe commissioners in a report made by them in the month of September, 1891, say that the parties interested in the work for which the land submitted to them to value the price of, was required were the proprietors of all the lots of land situate within the following limits, that is to say :\n1. On the north-east by a line following the centre of Parthenais street as opened, or projected from Sherboooke street to Notre-Dame street and continued from thence to the River St Lawrence\n2. On the south-east by the River St Lawrence\n3. On the south-west by a line along St. Andre and Campeau streets from Sherboooke street to Craig street, thence along Craig street to Lacroix street, thence along the centre of Lacroix street to Notre-Dame street, and continued from thence to the River St. Lawrence, all the lots fronting on St. Andr\u00e9 and Campeau streets, and on the north-west side of Craig street, between Campeau and Lacroix streets, no further than to the distance of 150 feet in depth.\n4. On the north-west by a line following Sherbrooke street, as opened or projected from St. Andr\u00e9 street to Parthenais street including the lots fronting on the north-west side of Sherbrooke street, but no further than to the depth of 150 feet\nThis description of the lands to be benefited by the projected improvement for which the land, the price of which was to be determined by the commissioners was required, seems to disclose that it was well understood that the improvement by which such an extent of land was to be specially benefited, was the whole of the works of harbour improvements as mentioned in the by-law 174, or at least the projected tunnel work thereby provided for; and not by any means so small a work as the opening a street of 330 feet in length from Craig street to Notre-Dame street, and according with such understanding no assessment of the lands within the limits named was ever made under sec. 228 of 52 Vict. ch. 79, but in 1893 the city proceeded not to open a street between Craig street and Notre-Dame street, 77 feet in width, but to construct the tunnel under Notre-Dame street and Brock street from Craig street to the harbour on the piece 42 feet in width, as designed and adopted by the by-law 174, and the plan annexed thereto, and to construct the high level street on the piece 35 feet in width between these streets as also designed by the said by-law and the plan annexed thereto. The construction of the tunnel work proceeded into the year 1895, when, as is said, it was found that the sum of $163,750 set apart for that work was insufficient, but for what reason such insufficiency arose, or at what stage of the work it was discovered, does not appear. It is obvious, however, that the price of the land required and used in the construction of the tunnel work therein is part of the cost of the improve-ment authorized by the by-law and constituted in fact the first charge upon and was payable out of the fund appropriated by the by-law to the tunnel work and that before the work of construction should have been commenced ; and there is no suggestion that it was not so paid, and if so paid out of the fund charged therewith there is an end of that matter ; but paid or not paid, however much the $163,750 set apart for the improvement designed to be accomplished by the completion of the tunnel should prove to be insufficient for that purpose, such deficiency could not in any respect affect the rights of the owners of the land required for and used in the construction of the work to the price of the land so used which was by the bylaw charged upon that fund.\nBefore such deficiency was ascertained the Act 57 Vict. ch. 57 was passed on the 8th day of January, 1894, by which it was enacted that\nnotwithstanding any law to the contrary, the cost of widening each of the following streets, namely, Pine Avenue, Bleury street, Milton street, inspector street, Cathedral street and Lagaucheti\u00e8re street, shall be paid as follows, namely: one-half by the city, and one-half by the proprietors fronting on the lines of the said streets assessed to a depth not exceeding one hundred feet. For the following streets : Ontario street from Frontenac to eastern limits, Beaudry street Pantal\u00e9on street St. Catherine street from D\u00e9sert street to the eastern limits, and Viger Square, the cost shall be paid as follows : one-half by the city and one-half by the proprietors interested as per existing rolls prepared by the commissioners in each case fixing the limits.\nNow the contention of the appellant is that the assessment made upon his property on Craig street in January, 1896, is absolutely void for the reason that the above Act, as is contended, relates solely to the cost of widening the streets therein named of which Beaudry street is one and that the land taken from the appellant and others between Craig street and Notre-Dame street was not taken for any such purpose but for the construction of the Brock street tunnel and the works in connection therewith to the cost of which or any part thereof the Act has no application.\nThe Superior Court has held that the Act of 1894 has authorised and made legal the assessment of 1896 the effect of which is to charge the appellant with a liability to reimburse the Corporation of the City of Montreal to the amount of $3,596.74 as part of the purchase money of the two several pieces of land between Craig street and Notre-Dame street, part of which was acquired from himself and used in the construction of the tunnel under the aforementioned by-law 174, and which purchase money was therefore chargeable and charged against the fund appropriated by the by-law to the cost of the tunnel. The Court of Review, Doherty J. dissenting, have affirmed this. judgment.\nThe judgment in effect holds that there is a distinction made by the Act between the streets named in the first part and those named in the latter part of the first section of the Act as above extracted, and that such distinction consists in this that the word \" widening \" is to be confined to the streets mentioned in the first sentence of the section and that as regards the streets mentioned in the second sentence of the same section it is to be construed as Including the opening of a new street or the pro~ longation of an existing one. And the judgment holds that the lands taken from the appellant and others between Craig street and Notre-Dame street and the work done thereon constituted simply a pro-elongation of Beaudry street from Craig street to Notre Dame street, as if done under the ordinary powers contained in section 140 and the other sections of the Act relating to the opening of streets, and so within the operation of the Act 57 Vict. ch 57.\nThe reasoning upon which the construction is based I understand to be that otherwise no effect could be given to the words at the close of the second sentence of the section, viz.:\nas our existing rolls prepared by the commissioners in each case fixing the limits,\nbut that construction, as was I think well argued by the learned counsel for the appellant, wholly assumes it not only to be an established fact but one which was present to the mind of the Legislature that there was no existing roll fixing the limits by commissioners of the lands to be assessed for the cost of widening any of the streets named in the second sentence of the ... section, which widening had not yet been completed when the Act 57 Vict. ch. 57 was passed. The words referred to seem to be open to an intelligent construction by reading them thus as relating to the cost of widening (which is the only word used in the Act for the purpose of which the Act purports to be passed) any of the streets named the cost to be by an assess-ment \" as per existing rolls\" in each case, if any such there be This seems a more reasonable construction than to give to the word \" widening\" as used by the Legislature the construction contended for by the respondents.\nThe true construction of the Act appears to me to be that it is in express terms limited to the \" widening\" of the streets named, that is of any of the streets named in the section and that like all other Acts, not expressed to be retroactive or in so far as it is not expressed to be retroactive, it must be construed as relating to future undertakings. If the words \" as per existing rolls \" &c, had not been inserted the statute would relate wholly to future undertakings of the nature and character named in the Act but the insertion of those words makes it retroactive in so far that it shall apply to undertakings of the nature and character named in the Act if any such there be which have proceeded so far as fixing the limits of lands liable to be but not yet assessed for payment of the cosi of such work ; but the words under consideration cannot be construed as extending the nature and character of the works in relation to which the Act is expressed upon its face to be passed.\nThere are moreover many considerations which to my mind render it impossible to construe the Act as having any application to the cost of the work for which the lands in question have been in fact taken and applied by the Corporation of the City of Montreal l or to the cost of any part of such work. There is not a syllable in the Act which justifies the conclusion that the Legislature had any knowledge that the sum of $1637750 set apart by the by-law no. 174 to defray the cost of the undertaking therein described as a tunnel under Brock street would prove insufficient for that purpose, or that they had it in contemplation to charge the cost of that work to any other fund than that provided by the by-law for the purpose, nor to supplement the deficiency of that fund, if such there should prove to be, by charging the price of the land appropriated to the construction of the tunnel to the parties assessed therefor by the assessment now under consideration in appeal- There is not a syllable in the Act which leads to the conclusion that the Legislature had it in contemplation by the Act 57 Vict. ch. 57, to separate the cost of acquiring the property upon which any work contemplated by the Act was to be performed from the residue of the cost of the work to which the Act relates or that they had it in contemplation to make thereby a provision for the cost of any part of the work covered by the by-law. So to construe the language used in the Act is in my judgment wholly unwarranted and irreconcilable with the principles applicable to the construction of statutes.\nFor all of the above reasons I am of opinion that the appeal must be allowed with costs and that the assessment against which this appeal is taken must be quashed and declared to be absolutely null and void and not authorised by the statute 57 Vict ch. 57.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: B\u00e9\u00efque, Lafontaine, Turgeon & Robertson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ethier & Archambault.\n[1] Q.

Hogg Q. C. and Madore for the appellant. The bond discloses no primary obligation but is for a penal sum only; it is in fact a wagering contract; see Arts. 1131 and 1927 C. C. The bond insures due and faithful performance of the postmaster's duties and in default for even the slightest sum there is liability to pay at least $1,600, or perhaps $3,200, if each surety is liable separately for the penal sum of $1,600 stipulated; see Art. 1933 C. C. The bond is to be construed according to the laws of the Province of Quebec which are binding on the Crown; The Exchange Bank of Canada v. The Queen[2]; see also Arts. 1994 (10) 2032 and 2086 O. C. There is no exception in favour of the Crown under Arts. 1053 and 1054 C. C., and the Crown is liable for torts; Attorney General of The Straits Settlements v. Wemyss[3]. This case is ruled by Arts. 1929-1965 C. C. relating to \"Suretyship,\" and the Crown is bound by the acts of its officers and servants; Kenney v. The Queen[4]. The Grown officers had been for a long time aware of misconduct of the postmaster and shortage in his accounts, but his offences were condoned and he was not discharged from his office. No notice of these circumstances was given to appellants and consequently they were relieved of further liability as sureties; Phillips v. Foxall[5]. The guarantee was founded on the trustworthiness of the servant so far as that was known to both parties. So soon as his dishonesty was discovered the whole foundation of the contract as regards the sureties failed and the Crown should have then dismissed him. By continuing him in office, without the knowledge or assent of the surety, the Crown took the risk of all losses arising from any future dishonesty; see Sanderson v. Aston[6]; Enright v. Falvey[7]. This continuance in office after the offences were discovered was equivalent to a re-engagement after each offence so far as the sureties were concerned, and they should not be held liable for defalcations which occurred after each such default where they were left in ignorance of the defalcations. The rule that the Crown cannot be bound by laches or negligence of its officers is not applicable in the present case inasmuch as the rights of the parties are governed by the contract and its implied terms The Crown must be affected by the breach of contract when the breach is caused by the negligent acts of the Crown's servants.\nThe appellants were discharged by the acts of the Crown which prevented them obtaining subrogation in rights and privileges against the principal or his estate; see Arts. 1956 and 1959 C. C. After the death of the post master the sureties were notified that there were no defalcations, excepting for $40 which was more than covered by a balance of salary, consequently the sureties permitted the widow to obtain the life insurance and balance of salary, amounting in all to $1,480.37, before the investigation which led to the discovery of defalcations amounting to $4,288, too late to allow the sureties the benefit of the insurance money and balance of salary, or to be subrogated in the rights and privileges of the Crown.\nThe defalcations were in respect of the Savings Bank Branch, while the bond relates only to the duties of the postmaster, as such and not to his acts respecting the Savings Branch; therefore as the breaches were with respect only to the Savings Bank Branch the action does not lie on the bond, which moreover is not made in accordance with the Acts under which it purports to be given, and is contrary to the laws of Quebec respecting suretyship; Arts. 1131, 1132 and 1929 C. C. We also refer to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Agriculture du Comt\u00e9 de Verch\u00e8res v. Robert[8]; Attorney General v. Black[9]; and Railton v. Mathews[10].\nFitzpatrick Q.C. (Solicitor-General for Canada), and New combe Q.C. (Deputy-Minister of Justice) for the Crown. The post-office authorities notified the sureties that the defaults had occurred when they were first discovered, and as they took no steps to terminate their obligation they continued bound; Shepherd v. Beecher[11]. See also The Queen v. Finlayson[12]. We rely also on the authorities cited in the judgment appealed from[13].\nThe decision in Phillips v. Foxall[14] has no application to the Crown, which cannot be held liable for laches or negligence of subordinate officials; see The Queen v. Fay[15]; Jones v. United States[16]; Frownfelter v. State of Maryland[17] at page 85; DeColyar on Guarantee p. 446.\nIn this case we have to consider not only the lex loci contractus but the lex loci solutionis as well; under this light the contract in question is not suretyship as governed by the Civil Code, and there can be no application of the principles decided in The Exchange Bank v. The Queen[18]. Here there is absolute impossibility of the performance of the principal obligation by the sureties; they are merely the portes forts for their principal's honesty and not sureties under the Code; 16 Troplong p. 394 \"Cautionnent,\" (ed. Delormier). They are liable for damages only. They cannot first require discussion of the estate of the principal, but are only entitled to their recourse over after making settlement.\nThe form of this bond is not known to Quebec law, but it is sufficient under the statutes and it was by these statutes that the parties intended themselves to be bound; see Lafleur on Conflict of Laws, p. 149; Hamlyn v. Talisker Distillery[19]; and Colonial Bank V. Cady & Williams[20].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court on an information filed by the Attorney General of the Dominion to enforce a bond executed by Henderson Black, one of the appellants, and by John Black, deceased, (who on this record is represented by his beneficiary heirs, the appellants' Henderson Black and Mary Black), as sureties for the due accounting by one James Macpherson, formerly postmaster at St. John's, in the Province of Quebec, (amongst other things), for all moneys and property which might come into his hands by virtue of his office of postmaster. This bond was a several bond, Macpherson was one of the obligors and he and each of the sureties were severally bound in a penal sum of $1,600. At the time of the appointment of Macpherson to the office in question it was part of the duty of the postmaster to receive moneys on behalf of the Crown for deposit with the Government, in the Post-Office Savings Bank, and such continued to be his duty up to the time of his death which occurred in December, 1896, whilst he was still in office. Some time after the death of Macpherson it was discovered that he was a defaulter in all to the amount of $4,288 for moneys which he had received as postmaster from Savings Bank Depositors and had omitted to remit to the proper office at Ottawa as his duty required him to do. It appears indisputably that he had applied these moneys to his own use and had attempted to conceal his embezzlement by false returns to the department and by fraudulent alterations made in the depositors' pass books.\nIt is objected by the appellants that the bond having been executed in the Province of Quebec, its legal validity depends on the law of that province. Speaking for myself only, and in that respect I believe differing from some of my learned brothers, I do not assent to this proposition. I am willing however for the purposes of the present case to assume it to be so and to deal with the case at present as one to be governed exclusively by the Civil Code of Quebec. Then it is said on behalf of the appellants that Article 1131 applies, which says that:\nA penal clause is a secondary obligation by which a person, to assure the performance of the primary obligation, binds himself to a penalty in case of its in execution.\nIt is contended that here there was no primary obligation as Macpherson, the principal for whom the Hendersons were mere sureties, was himself only bound by a like penalty and that there was therefore no such primary obligation as Article 1131 requires as a basis for the penalty contracted for by the sureties. The answer to this is plainly that given by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court, that the primary obligation is that which bound Macpherson, the principal, irrespective of the bond altogether, duly to account for moneys received by him for the behalf of the Crown.\nFurther the bond is given pursuant to the terms of a Dominion statute which Parliament had undoubted power to enact, and even if the law of Quebec as enunciated in Article 1131 would ordinarily apply here, the liability of the appellant is dependent on the Act of Parliament and not on the Code.\nNext it is said that the laches of the Crown officers in not communicating the default of the postmaster to the sureties, by which they were deprived of the benefit of a statute which provides that sureties for Crown officers may obtain their release by giving notice of their wish to be discharged to the Crown, and allowing a certain time to elapse, is a bar to the Crown. To this it is answered that notice was given to the appellant Henderson Black, for himself and on behalf of his brother John Black, of the principal defalcation which had been discovered before Macpherson's death The evidence on this point is contradicted by Henderson Black, but the learned judge seems to treat the facts of notice as established. There is, however, a much more conclusive answer, namely, that the Crown is never bound by the laches or default of its officers. In one aspect of this doctrine it is applied in cases of tort where the rule respondent superior is held not to apply to the Crown. There is therefore nothing in this point.\nAnother defence which is set up is that, according to the case of Philips v. Foxall[21] the Crown was bound to discharge the postmaster so soon as it had notice of his misconduct in office, and that having retained him they cannot call on the sureties to make good his subsequent defaults. This argument is refuted by the same rule of law that the Crown is not liable for the acts of its subordinate officers, their knowledge is not that of the Crown, and the latter is not responsible for their neglect or wrongful acts. Indeed the public business could not be properly transacted if any other rule were to prevail. The Crown has no alternative but to employ inferior officers by whom the duties of the public service must be carried on, and if it were the law that the Crown should be bound by their wrongful acts or by their negligence, the interests of the public would be greatly prejudiced.\nThere is so little in the point that there was an insurance on Black's life, the amount of which the sureties allowed his widow to receive without objection, which they would not have done if they had been informed of his acts of embezzlement, that it scarcely calls for notice It is already answered by what has been said as to the Crown not being affected by the omissions of the post-office inspectors. Moreover, the sureties had no lien on these insurance monies; at most they could only have come in competition with other creditors, for they had no right to be subrogated to the remedies of the Crown even if the Crown had, in the Province of Quebec, priority over other creditors, a question of prerogative law which the Privy Council has determined against the Crown. The learned judge rightly treated this defence also as unavailable to the appellants.\nOn the whole there is no error in the judgment of the Exchequer Court, and the appeal must be dismissed with costs,\nTASCHEREAU J;\u2014I: agree that this appeal must be dismissed. The case, is ruled entirely by the law of the Province of Quebec. The bond in question was on the part of Black a contract of suretyship. Arts. 1:131 and: 1135 of the Civil Code have nothing to do with it. This is not an obligation with a penal clause.\nNow by this bond Black undertook to make up whatever; deficiencies should be found against McPherson up to the amount of $1,600 and no more. In the case of a deficiency in a smaller amount the sureties would be bound to pay that amount; but nothing more. The Crown cannot be taken to have intended to stipulate that $1,600 would be paid by the sureties if the deficiency were say only $200. And on the other hand, however much higher were the deficiency over $1,600, the surety was not to be liable for any sum over $1,600. On the other points in the case, I fully agree with the remarks of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court[22]. It is the law of the Province of Quebec, as of the rest of the British Empire, in the absence of an express statutory enactment to the contrary, that the Crown is not liable for the laches or neglect of its officers, and the contentions of the appellants denying it are totally unfounded.\nGWYNNE and KING JJ. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Taschereau.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Madore, Guerin & Merrill.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

Township of Osgoode v. York (24 Can. S.C.R. 282) followed.\nIf the initiating party is not really an owner the filing of a declaration of ownership under the Act will not confer jurisdiction.\nSection 24 of the Act, which provides that an award thereunder, after expiration of the time for appealing to the judge, or after it is affirmed on appeal, shall be binding notwithstanding any defects in form or substance either in the award or any of the proceedings, does not validate an award or proceedings where the party initiating the latter is not an owner.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of Armour C.J. at the trial.\nThis appeal involved the validity of an award by an engineer under The Ditches and Watercourses Act, 1894, of Ontario, the award being attacked on the ground that Kelly, who initiated the proceedings for construction of a ditch on which the award was made was not an \u201cowner\u201d under the Act, being only a lessee of land though holding an option to purchase the fee. The Court of Appeal upheld the award on the ground that an objection to the declaration of ownership could not be taken after the award was filed.\nShepley Q.C. for the appellant.\nGarrow Q.C. and Thompson for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be allowed.\nIt may be assumed in the respondent\u2019s favour that this was not a proceeding for the reconsideration of the former award made by McKenna, but an original proceeding under section 33. This was the opinion of a majority of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal, and I am willing to accept their view as the correct one, though without any intention of pronouncing decisively on the point.\nThat Kelly was not an owner within the meaning of that word as used in the Act of 1894, is, I think, established by the authority of Osgoode v. York[2] in this court. The Act of 1894 contains an interpretation clause which the former Act under which Osgoode v. York2 was decided did not contain, but it does not define the meaning of the word \u201cowner\u201d standing alone, and we must therefore attribute to that word the same meaning which was given to it in the previous decision referred to. This interpretation clause however declares that the word \u201cowner\u201d shall mean and include not only an \u201cowner\u201d but any person entitled to sell and convey the land. This expression \u201cthe land\u201d clearly would not apply to a mere chattel interest; it can only mean an absolute estate, the fee simple, and was doubtless intended to apply to persons having not an estate but a mere power to convey the whole interest, the fee simple. Then Kelly was neither an owner nor a person having such a power; he was a mere lessee for years having, it is true, an option to purchase the fee, which option, however, he had never elected to exercise, and under which he could only obtain a title upon the condition that he duly performed the covenants of the lease and paid his purchase money.\nI have therefore no doubt that Chief Justice Burton was right in holding that Kelly was not an owner, and therefore not a person entitled to put the machinery of the Act in operation. The learned Chief Justice points out a test which may be applied to ascertain if Kelly was an \u201cowner\u201d within the Act; he asks could not the Canada Company, Kelly\u2019s lessors, have initiated proceedings such as these, as owners? Beyond all doubt they could, having the fee. Then as there cannot be two owners in severalty of the same land is not this conclusive to show that Kelly was not one? I think this is unanswerable.\nI cannot agree that the mere filing of the declaration, whether true or not, was sufficient to attach the jurisdiction conferred by the Act. There are good reasons for saying that no one who has not a substantial interest in the land should be able to take advantage of the provisions of the Act imposing as it does a burden on neighbouring proprietors. If the mere filing of the declaration was a sufficient answer to the objection that Kelly was not an owner, the declaration would be a mere senseless formality. What was intended was that no person other than one having the interest required by the Act should be able to put the proceedings in force. This appears from the Act itself. The provision added by section 1 of the amending Act (58 Vict. ch. 54), that in case of omission to file a decla- ration of ownership the judge may permit one to be filed at any stage of the proceedings \u201cin case of ownership\u201d (by which is meant if the party actually is the owner), is alone sufficient to show that in order that the Act should apply the fact of ownership is required. The case of Osgoode v. York[3] is therefore a conclusive authority in favour of the appellant unless section 24 of 57 Vict. ch. 55 applies. That clause is as follows:\nEvery award made under the provisions of this Act shall after the lapse of the time hereinbefore limited for appeal to the judge, and after the determination of appeals, if any, by him where the award is affirmed, be valid and binding to all intents and purposes notwithstanding any defect in form or substance either in the award or in any of the proceedings relating to the works to be done thereunder taken under the provisions of this Act.\nThis, in my opinion, is entirely insufficient to cure an objection such as that which has been taken, not to the form or substance of the award but to the acquisition by the engineer of jurisdiction to make an award. The language is too plain to need any interpretation. The proceedings other than the award which are covered by this section are not the proceedings to be taken anterior to it for the purpose of putting in operation the machinery of the Act, but those \u201crelating to the works to be done thereunder.\u201d It is, I think, manifest, that this is not conclusive on the appellants.\nMr. Justice Moss has held that the appellants were bound by acquiescence or equitable estoppel. As to this I am of opinion that such a defence is not applicable in statutory proceedings of this kind. Moreover it is not shown that the parties acquiesced with their eyes open after having acquired knowledge of the defect in the initiatory proceedings, an element always essential to the principle of equitable estoppel. But there is not the slightest pretence that as regards the defendant municipality, the present appellant, there was in fact anything like acquiescence even if the doctrine could be applied in such a case as the present. The result is that we are bound by the decision in Osgoode v. York[4] to hold that all the proceedings were void, and consequently that the appellants have come under no such liability as that sought to be enforced against them.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs, and the judgment of Chief Justice Armour restored; the appellants must also have their costs in the Court of Appeal.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an action in which the Corporation of the Township of Logan as plaintiffs seek to recover from the defendants a sum of money claimed to be due to the plaintiffs as a statutory debt in virtue of the provisions of the Ontario Statute 57 Vict. ch. 55, intituled \u201cAn Act respecting Ditches and Watercourses,\u201d passed in substitution for a previously existing statute of like title as amended by 51 Vict., ch. 35, and 52 Vict. ch. 49, and 53 Vict. ch. 68, which several statutes were repealed by 57 Vict. ch. 55. In an action of this nature it is, I think, the undoubted right of every person upon whom such a statutory debt is sought to be imposed, to insist that the plaintiff should establish by incontrovertible evidence that the provisions prescribed as necessary to the creation of the debt claimed have been complied with in the minutest particulars, and accordingly the only defence which is offered to this action is that the plaintiffs have failed to establish that such provisions of the statute have been complied with. It appears that prior to the passing of the Act 57 Vict., and sometime in the year 1893, a ditch or watercourse was at the instance of one Timothy Kelly commenced to be constructed from lot no. 35, in the 5th concession of the Township of Logan, across the town line between the Townships of McKillop and Logan, and across lots nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, in the 5th and 6th concessions of the Township of McKillop, under the supervision and direction of one McKenna, a P.L.S., who was then engineer of the said Township of Logan. Sometime prior to the 28th day of August, 1894, but when in particular does not appear, McKenna ceased to fill that office. Upon that day the Corporation of the Township of Logan passed a by-law whereby one John Roger, P.L.S., was appointed \u201cengineer of the said township under the provisions of the Ditches and Watercourses Act.\u201d The ditch so commenced to be constructed was proceeded with in pursuance of an award assumed to have been made by McKenna, as engineer of the Township of Logan, under the provisions of the Ditches and Watercourses Act then in existence, but the award was not produced. When the ditch so constructed was completed or what were its dimensions as designed and as constructed does not appear; all that we know upon this subject is that Mr. Roger testifies that he first saw the ditch in July, 1894, and he could not say whether it was then completed or not for that there was no bench mark to go by, but he says that in October of that year after he was appointed engineer of the township he considered that if it had been completed it must have fallen in and for that reason he, of his own motion, caused it to be cleaned out, and when such cleaning out work was done he says that the ditch was put into complete order. The lots nos. 2 and 3 and the east half of lot no. 4, in the 5th concession of McKillop across which the McKenna ditch was constructed was the property of one Timothy T. Coleman who departed this life on the 29th July, 1893, having first duly made and published his last will in writing by which he devised all his property subject to the payment of his debts unto his wife and his sons T.F. Coleman and E.C. Coleman (whom he also made executrix and executors of his will) in trust to hold the same upon certain trusts in his will stated. The length of the McKenna ditch across lots 2 and 3 and the east half of lot 4, in the 5th concession of McKillop was 201 7\/10 rods, and just one-third of the whole length of the ditch, and the cost of its construction across these lots to the Coleman estate apart from the cleaning out work done in October, 1894, under the order of Mr. Roger, was upwards of $230, and the cost of such cleaning out work $40, making in the whole upwards of $270. Now the statute in sections from 7 to 15, both inclusive, prescribes the manner in which alone the powers conferred by the Act for the \u201cconstruction\u201d of a ditch (which the interpretation clause defines to be \u201cthe original opening or making of a ditch by artificial means\u201d) shall be brought into operation and who are the persons competent to invoke such provisions, and from these, it plainly appears that, with the exception of municipalities, it is only an owner of land who can invoke and bring into action those powers which when exercised under the provisions of the Act have the effect of imposing a burthen upon other lands and the present and future owners of such other lands. Sections 7 and 8 are very precise upon this point, as indeed also are sections 13, 14 and 16. Then sections 16 to 20, inclusive, prescribe the proceedings to be taken by the engineer (when his services are duly called into action by compliance with the previous provisions of the Act in that behalf) for taking into consideration the subject matter of the requisition by which his services are invoked, and for making an award thereon and for filing the same and for the service thereof upon the parties affected thereby.\nSections 36 enacts that\nAny owner, party to the award whose lands are affected by a ditch whether constructed under this Act or any other Act respecting ditches and watercourses may at any time after the expiration of two years from the completion of the construction thereof take proceedings for the reconsideration of the agreement or award under which it was constructed, and in every such case he shall take the same proceedings and in the same form and manner as are hereinbefore provided in the case of the \u201cconstruction of a ditch.\u201d\nNow, Timothy Kelly, who was a party to the McKenna award and the one at whose instance the proceedings in which it was made were taken, and because as he says, of the McKenna ditch seeming to him not to work satisfactorily in so far as the north half of lot 35 in the 5th concession of Logan was concerned, did upon the 11th of June, 1895, make and file a declaration of ownership wherein he declared that he was the owner in fee simple of the north half of the said lot, and upon the same 11th of June he wrote several notices in the form produced and filed as exhibit three, which notices in the view which I take may be admitted to have been respectively duly addressed to and received by the several persons who were owners or occupants of the several lots mentioned in the McKenna award and across or upon which the McKenna ditch was constructed. These notices so addressed severally commenced as follows:\nSir,\u2014I am, within the meaning of \u201cthe Ditches and Watercourses Act, 1894,\u201d the owner of the north half of lot no. 35, in the 5th concession of the Township of Logan, and as such I require to reconsider an award drain made under the provisions of the said Act for the draining of my said land.\nThis requisition was transmitted by the clerk of the Township of Logan to and was received, by Mr. Roger, the engineer of that township, and it consti- tuted his sole authority, if any he had, to act thereunder, and notwithstanding that this requisition called merely for a reconsideration of the McKenna award, the engineer proceeded, as appears upon the face of his award, as if he was proceeding under the Act for the original construction of a ditch. True it is that the section 36 requires the owner of land who takes proceedings for the reconsideration of an award under which a ditch has been previously constructed to take the same proceedings, and in the same manner and form as prescribed in the Act for the original construction of a ditch, but it by no means says that upon a requisition for reconsideration of an award under which a ditch has been constructed the engineer may make an award as if he was acting under a requisition calling for the \u201cconstruction\u201d of a ditch where as yet there was none constructed. Now the engineer by his award assumed to direct that Timothy Kelly, the person making the requisition for reconsideration of the previous (McKenna) award under which alone the engineer was acting, \u201cshould make, complete and maintain\u201d a ditch upon the north half of lot 35, in the 5th concession of Logan, between certain specified points and should furnish therefor 250 feet of 5 inch tile, the cost of all which the engineer estimated at $10; this work either wholly or in part was within the limits of the McKenna ditch. Then where the McKenna ditch crossed the town line between the townships of Logan and McKillop, from the north half of lot 35 in the 5th concession of Logan to lot no. 1 in the 5th concession of McKillop, the award assumed to direct that the corporations of said townships jointly should \u201cmake, complete and maintain\u201d a ditch across the said town line at a cost estimated by the engineer at $8. The award in like manner assumed to direct that one Thomas Levy as owner of the north half of lot no. 1 in the 5th concession of McKillop should make, complete and maintain a ditch within certain specified points upon that lot at a cost estimated by the engineer at $12; all this work was also within the limits of the McKenna ditch. Then as to lots 2 and 3, and the east half of lot 4, in the 5th concession of McKillop, the award assumed to direct \u201cColeman Brothers\u201d as owners of these lots to make, complete and maintain a ditch across them within certain specified points, also within the limits of the McKenna ditch, at a cost estimated by the engineer at $30. In like manner across the west of lot no. 4 in the said 5th concession of McKillop, the award assumed to direct one Michael Walsh as owner of such west lot to make, complete and maintain a ditch at a cost estimated by the engineer at $2; and so in like manner the award assumed to direct one Patrick Walsh as owner of lot 5 in the 5th concession of McKillop to make, complete and maintain a ditch on that lot within certain specified limits at a cost estimated by the engineer at $5. The McKenna ditch at this point entered the 6th concession of McKillop on lot no. 1, and continued across that lot and lots 2, 3, 4 and 5, in said 6th concession, and the award in like language as above, assumed to direct the several persons named therein as owners of said respective lots to make, complete and maintain a ditch across the said several lots within specified points therein respectively, at a cost estimated by the engineer as follows: On lot no. 1, at $1; on lot no. 2, at $2; on lot no. 3, at $3; on lot no. 4, at $1.50; and on lot no. 5, at $12. The whole of this work so directed to be done within the township of McKillop was directed to be done within the limits of and upon the McKenna ditch, and the total cost was estimated by the engineer at $89, including the work directed to be done by Kelly, on lot 35 in the 5th concession of Logan, at the estimated cost of $10. It may be that what the engineer has by his award ordered to be done might have been directed to be done under an award expressed to be made under a requisition for reconsideration of a previous award, and in such case the award might have been amended under the 22nd section of the Act, but the objection relied on upon this point is not that the work ordered to be done by the engineer\u2019s award was not of a character which could have been ordered by an award made upon a requisition for reconsideration of a previous award, but that upon a requisition for reconsideration of a previous award no valid award could be made nor could any proceedings be taken for reconsideration of a previous award until after the expiration of two years from the completion of the ditch constructed under the previous award. That the parties in the Township of McKillop named in this award took no steps to comply with the directions in the award appears by the evidence of Kelly and by a letter addressed by him and sent to the engineer, Roger, in October, 1895, which is as follows:\nLOGAN, October 10th.\nLot 35, in 5th concession.\nSIR,\u2014I hereby give you notice that the parties on the west end of the drain leading from me have done nothing at it yet, and as the time is up I want you to attend to it at once.\nYours truly,\nTIMOTHY KELLY.\nWhen Mr. Roger received this notice he had knowledge that the Coleman estate repudiated the validity of the award, and he had received one or more letters from that estate upon that subject, but such letters and all notices and papers which he ever had relating to the proceedings in the matter he says he destroyed when the time for appealing against his award had expired, with the exception of the requisition under which he acted. Upon receiving from Kelly the above notice of the 10th of October, he says that he went up to the ditch upon the lots 2 and 3, and east half of 4, in the 5th concession of McKillop, and found that no work had been commenced there, nor upon lot no. 1 in the said 5th concession, which was the only lot lying between the Coleman Trust estate and lot 35 in Logan, and he says he made no inspection to ascertain whether anything had been done below the east half of lot no. 4 in McKillop; he proceeded, he says, against the Coleman estate alone, and professing to act under section 28 of the statute he let to one Gaffney, at the sum of $360.38, the work on lots 2 and 3 and the east half of 4 in McKillop, which in his award he had estimated at $30, and subsequently he gave to Gaffney a certificate that he had completed the work so let to him and was entitled to receive from the Township of Logan the said sum of $360.38, together with $18 for engineer\u2019s fees, which sum the said township in virtue of that certificate paid to Gaffney, and the township now brings this action to recover from the Township of McKillop the said sums amounting to $378.38 as a statutory debt due to the township of Logan under sections 29 and 30 of the Act. The Township of McKillop authorities not being able to understand how they could collect $378.38 as an assessment upon lands, the whole of which was rented at $200 per annum, and being notified by the Coleman estate trustees that they regarded the award as wholly invalid, and that they would resist any attempt to levy such sum from the estate, took the advice of their solicitor, who advised them not to pay unless compelled by judgment in an action. Accordingly the present action has been brought in the course of which it was urged, as part of the contention of the Coleman trust estate, that the work ordered by the Roger award was absolutely of no benefit whatever to their lands in McKillop, and that in point of fact the sole object and intent of that work was for the benefit of lot 35, in the 5th concession of Logan, and it may be of other lands in that township. That contention would, it may be admitted, have been a good objection to the award upon an appeal under the 22nd section of the statute, and the Coleman trust estate could have obtained adequate and perfect relief in so far as that objection is concerned under the provisions of that section, but no such contention can be entertained as a defence in the present action.\nThen again, it was urged as another part of the Coleman trust estate contention that the letting by the engineer at the sum of $360.38, work upon the lots 2 and 3, and the east half of 4, in the 5th concession of McKillop, estimated by him at $30, was an arbitrary, collusive and illegal proceeding, but if any actionable wrong was committed by the engineer by his letting the work as he did, upon which I express no opinion, that was a wrong against the Coleman trust estate and the proper subject of an action at the suit of such estate, but cannot I think be entertained as a defence to the present action.\nThe action was tried by the learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario, who upon the authority of Osgoode v. York[5] in this court, held that the whole of the proceedings taken by Timothy Kelly were illegal and void for that he was not the owner of the north half of lot 35, in the 5th concession of Logan, and he was therefore incompetent to initiate proceedings under the statute, and that for such his incompetency all the proceedings taken and the award made therein were wholly null and void. That he was not the owner of that lot conclusively appeared by his own title deed produced from his possession for the purpose of establishing the truth of the averment necessarily inserted in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim that he, as owner of the said lot, had instituted the proceedings in which the award was made. This title deed was merely an indenture of lease dated the 1st of February, 1895, for a term of seven years at a certain rent thereby reserved, and executed by the Canada Company, the owners in fee of the said lot by the said indenture of lease demised. This indenture of lease was subject to a proviso for re\u2011entry by the lessors upon breach by the lessee of any of his covenants therein contained which covenants are of such a special character; so unequivocally affirmatory of the fact that the lessors are the owners of the lot so demised, that it is difficult to conceive how Kelly could have supposed himself to be (as in the declaration of ownership filed by him is alleged) owner of the lot. If the statute required a declaration of ownership to be filed by way of some moral assurance and security to the parties to be affected by the proceedings that they should not be troubled by an incompetent person assuming to initiate proceedings under the Act this case shews how inadequate such contemplated security is. The Court of Appeal for Ontario reversed the judgment of the learned trial judge for the reasons, first, that in the opinion of some of the learned judges in appeal clause seven of the Act of 1894, which was first enacted after the decision in Osgoode v. York[6], dispensed with the necessity of the party initiating proceedings being an owner or that the filing of the declaration of ownership required by that section was to be taken as conclusive evidence of the party filing such declaration being the owner of the land as therein alleged; and secondly, that after the expiration of time limited by the Act for appealing against an award all objections are removed by section 24 of the Act. That the filing of a declaration of ownership cannot be held to be substituted for the fact of ownership by a party initiating proceedings under the Act or accepted as conclusive evidence of ownership by such party not only appears from sections 7 to 15 inclusive, in the former of which it is naturally enacted that it is an owner alone who can before instituting proceedings file the declaration of ownership therein required, but ch. 54 of 58 Vict. passed for amending sec. 7 of 57 Vict. ch. 55, is conclusive upon the point for this Act enacts as a proviso to the sec. 7, that in case of omission by an owner through inadvertence or mistake to file his declaration of ownership before instituting his proceedings under the Act the judge may permit the certificate to be filed at any stage of the proceedings (instituted by the owner) provided that the ownership in fact existed at the time of the commencement of the proceedings. There can therefore, I think, be no doubt that the Act is peremptory that no one but an owner of land is competent to initiate proceedings under the Act, and that no award made in proceedings instituted by a person who was not an owner of land is of any validity whatever. For this reason and for the reason also that the plaintiffs have failed to shew that two years had elapsed subsequently to the completion of the work ordered by the McKenna award before the institution by Kelly of his proceedings for reconsideration of that award, but that the contrary sufficiently appears in the evidence, I am of opinion that the appeal must be allowed with costs and the judgment of Chief Justice Armour dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action, restored. The 24th section of the Act has application only to awards and proceedings taken \u201cunder the provisions of the Act\u201d and has no application therefore to awards made in proceedings taken by a person not competent under the provisions of the Act to take such proceedings, or to proceedings taken for a purpose at a time when for such purpose the proceedings are not warranted by the provisions of the Act.\nKING and GIROUARD JJ. concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

To the fifth question: \u201cCould Rowan by the exercise of reasonable care and diligence have avoided the accident?\u201d the answer was: \u201cWe believe that it could have been possible.\u201d\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that this answer did not amount to a finding of negligence on the part of the plaintiff as a proximate cause of the accident which would disentitle him to a verdict.\nHeld, further, that as the other findings established negligence in the defendant as the cause of the accident which amounted to a denial of contributory negligence; as there was no evidence of negligence on plaintiff\u2019s part in the record; and as the court had before it all the materials for finally determining the questions in dispute, a new trial was not necessary. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of Mr. Justice MacMahon at the trial.\nThe question for decision and the circumstances under which it arose are sufficiently stated in the above head-note, and fully set out in the judgments on this appeal.\nJudgment was given for the defendant, and the action dismissed at the trial on the ground that the jury had found contributory negligence by the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal unanimously affirmed this judgment.\nAylesworth Q.C. and Ross for the appellant.\nOsler Q.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The first question we are called upon to decide in determining this appeal is as to whether the judgment which the learned judge ordered to be entered for the defendant was warranted by the findings of the jury.\nThe questions left to the jury were the following:\n1st. Was the railway company guilty of any negligence in running the motor car?\n2nd. If you find that the company was negligent, in what did the negligence consist?\n3rd. Was such negligence the cause of the accident?\n4th. At what rate of speed was the car running at the time of the accident?\n5th. Could Rowan by the exercise of reasonable care and diligence have avoided the accident?\nTo these questions the jury answered as follows:\nTo the first they say, yes. To the second they answer, \u201crunning too fast.\u201d To the third, simply, yes. To the fourth they say sixteen miles an hour. And to the fifth and last question their answer is, \u201cwe believe that it could have been possible.\u201d The four first findings by themselves would clearly have required that the judgment should have been entered for the plaintiff (the appellant), but the learned judge, treating the answer to the fifth question as a finding of contributory negligence on the part of the appellant, entered the judgment against him. This construction of the answer to the fifth question seems also to be that adopted by the Court of Appeal, who, however, have not placed the reasons for their judgment on record.\nThere can be no doubt but that the first four findings are conclusive against the respondents on the question of negligence. The jury find that this neglect of duty on the part of the respondents consists in running their car at an undue rate of speed and that this was the cause of the accident.\nThe question put to the jury on the subject of contributory negligence was not so framed as to elicit from them any statement of what, in the event of their answer being an affirmative one, the contributory negligence consisted. Then are we to construe the answer to the fifth question as a finding of contributory negligence, that is negligence on the part of the appellant which was a proximate cause of the accident; in other words, negligence but for which the car would not have come in collision with him? I am of opinion that we ought not to follow the courts below in placing such a construction upon the language of the jury. The question called for a direct categorical answer, yes, or no, and had the jury seen their way to an absolute conclusion either one way or the other, the answer would no doubt have been in that form. In order to disentitle the appellant to recover, it must be found distinctly that the accident was attributable to his failure in the duty imposed upon him of taking proper care to avoid the accident. Can it be said that the answer of the jury amounts to this? In the appellant\u2019s factum there is contained a very clear and able verbal criticism of this answer to the fifth question, and if any one can have doubts as to the meaning of the jury, the appellant\u2019s argument printed in his factum will, I think, be found convincing. It is quite consistent with the wording of this answer that it might have been most improbable that the accident could have been avoided by such reasonable care as the appellant was bound to take. I find in a judgment which I shall have to cite for another purpose upon a point of law, an instance in which the word \u201cpossible\u201d is shown to be quite compatible with the expression \u201cimprobable\u201d or \u201cextremely unlikely.\u201d In this case (which happens to be, like this, an action for negligence, though that is not material, as I do not cite it as authority but merely as showing the meaning of the words) Chief Baron Palles speaking of the accident in the case before him says:\nThat it can happen with due care is, according to my experience, no doubt possible, but extremely improbable[1].\nIn the same way here it may also be said that the avoidance of the accident by due care on the part of the appellant might have been possible but was extremely improbable. We cannot therefore accept the answer as one imputing to the appellant want of due care as a proximate cause of the injury which can alone constitute negligence sufficient to deprive him of his remedy against the respondents for their negligence of which the jury have in no ambiguous terms found them guilty. I regard this verdict as amounting to no more than if the jury had said, \u201cperhaps it might have been possible.\u201d Then what must be the effect of this conclusion. The findings of the jury in the answers to the first four questions establish a conclusive case of actionable negligence amply sufficient to entitle the appellant to judgment. The answer to the third question distinctly finds that this negligence was the cause of the accident. This last answer, meaning as we must take it to mean \u201csole cause of the accident,\u201d would of course be inconsistent with any findings of contributory negligence since that must consist in doing or not doing something which was the proximate cause or a proximate cause of the collision. Therefore must we not regard the findings taken together as negativing contributory negligence? I am of opinion that must be the result. Combining the answer to the third and fifth questions, I read them as if the jury had said the defendant\u2019s negligence was the cause, though \u201cperhaps\u201d the accident might have been avoided if the plaintiff had taken more care. Upon such an answer in terms there could be no doubt but that the judgment should have been entered for the appellant.\nIt may, however, be said on behalf of the respondents that there was some evidence of contributory negligence and that question ought therefore to have been passed upon by the jury, and as it has not been there should be at least a new trial. The respondents did not plead contributory negligence as they availed themselves of their right to plead \u201cnot guilty by statute\u201d under which they were entitled to raise this defence which they certainly insisted upon at the trial. Therefore when we strike out, as it were, the answer to the fifth question there seems at first sight some reason for saying that there is no finding of the jury on a most material defence set up at the trial, one which the learned judge considered the evidence warranted him in leaving to the jury, and that, therefore, there ought to be a new trial as a necessary conse- quence of the course adopted in treating the answer of the jury as immaterial. No doubt the court may under Con. Rule (Ont.) 615 on a motion to enter judgment, if it thinks the justice of the case requires it as a consequence of their decision that a wrong judgment was entered, grant a new trial although neither party has in the first instance asked for it, and such new trial may be either of the whole case or of some particular issue or question. I have, however, come to the conclusion that this course ought not to be followed here for reasons which I proceed to state. In the first place there has been, as said before, a finding on this question of contributory negligence. The third and fifth answers read together amount to a negation of it. Further the respondents cannot be entitled to a new trial unless they are able to point to some evidence of negligence on the part of the appellant. Then I can find none. The appellant had a perfect right to ride on a bicycle either between the rails on either line, or on the strip between the two lines of rails; this was only that ordinary use of the highway to which the public are entitled of common right, for the railway company is not to be considered as having expropriated so much of the highway as lies between their lines of rails. Then they are bound to make a reasonable use of the privilege they have obtained to run electric cars on their rails laid on the streets and this requires due care as regards other passengers. An undue rate of speed such as they were running at in the present case constitutes negligence and this has been rightly found against them by the jury. Now in what way was the appellant guilty of contributory negligence? Certainly not in riding on the strip between the rails; he had a right so to use the highway. It will be said perhaps that there was evidence that the gong was sounded and that he ought to have heard it; the answer to this is that the car being run at the rate of sixteen miles an hour which was in itself negligence, the appellant was not bound to look out for it as he was for cars running at the regular and established rate of not more than eight miles, any more than a foot passenger using a common roadway is bound to look out for and avoid vehicles which are being driven along it at racing speed. The sounding of the gong, assuming that evidence to be true, does not therefore relieve the respondents from their liability or make out the appellant\u2019s failure to hear it or to be warned by it to be a contributing proximate cause of the accident. Then it will be said that the plaintiff turned the wrong way when he became aware of the proximity of the car. What people ought to do for purposes of self-protection when in a cool and deliberate frame of mind is no standard of what they ought to do when suddenly placed as the appellant was here by the negligence of the defendants in the presence of immediate danger. It does not lie in the mouth of those who by their wrongful conduct placed him in such a dangerous situation to say that he might have avoided the accident if he had kept his presence of mind. I do not refer particularly to the evidence as Mr. Justice Gwynne in the judgment which he has written has done that, and I entirely agree with his observations on it. If it is said these were matters of fact for the consideration of the jury whose duty it is not only to deal with any conflict on the testimony but also to draw inferences from the facts in evidence, the answer is that there is also a preliminary duty for the judge to perform; he must determine whether there is any evidence for the jury. As Lord Blackburn said in Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Co. v. Slattery[2]. There is in every case a preliminary question which is one of law, viz.: whether there is any evidence on which the jury could properly find the question for the party on whom the onus of proof lies; if there is not the judge ought to withdraw the question from the jury and direct a nonsuit if the onus is on the plaintiff or direct a verdict for the plaintiff if the onus is on the defendant.\nAgain in the same case Lord Penzance says:\nThe proof of the first issue, which is that of the defendant\u2019s negligence, is upon the plaintiff, the proof of the second, which is that of contributory negligence, lies upon the defendants. Upon either of these issues it is competent to the judge to say negatively that there is not sufficient evidence to go to the jury.\nThen in performing this duty all reasonable inference must be drawn by the judge or court. In the case of Flannery v. The Waterford & Limerick Railway Co.[3], Palles C.B. having before him a case in which it was sought to apply this rule on a motion to nonsuit on the ground that there was no evidence of negligence, says:\nThe rule has no application to cases in which a reasonable inference in favour of the plaintiff might be drawn. * * In determining this the judge must avail himself of his knowledge of the ordinary affairs and incidents of life.\nThere is of course nothing new in these well established principles and I only make the references to authorities for the sake of making my meaning clear. I must then hold that there was in the present case no evidence of contributory negligence for the jury.\nBut there is still a further ground for allowing this appeal. Supposing that I am wrong in interpreting the findings of the jury as negativing contributory negligence and in holding there was no evidence of it for the jury, and it is therefore said that there ought to be a new trial in order that this question of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence may be submitted to another jury, I think that in that view and in the absence of any finding as regards contributory negligence upon which the court can act this would be a proper case for the application of rule 615 (Con. Rules Ont.). By that rule on a motion for judgment or a new trial the court may, if it has all materials before it for finally determining the questions in dispute, give judgment accordingly. Then here the court has before it all the evidence which the parties were able to adduce on this question of fact and they may therefore in the absence of any finding by the jury on the point in question take upon themselves the decision of the question. Hamilton v. Johnson[4]; Toulmin v. Millar[5]. I have therefore no hesitation in saying that having recourse to this rule of practice and dealing with the question of contributory negligence on the evidence as a question of fact just as a jury might do, I should find that there was not sufficient proof of that fact, and that the defence based on it consequently failed.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs, the judgment for the respondents vacated and judgment entered for the appellant for $1,500, the damages found by the jury. The appellant must also have his costs in the court below.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The question on this appeal is as to the construction to be put upon the answer of the jury to one of several questions submitted to them by the learned trial judge.\nThe plaintiff in his statement of claim complains of having been run down and severely injured by an electric motor car of the defendants on the night of the 2nd of July, 1896, when he was riding on a bicycle on Spadina Avenue in the City of Toronto and he charges specifically\nthat the said accident was occasioned solely by reason of the gross negligence of the defendants and their agents in running their motor car negligently, recklessly and at a dangerous and excessive rate of speed on the said highway at the time of the accident.\nTo this claim the defendants pleaded the general issue of not guilty per statute. The case came down for trial on the 31st March, 1897, and as presented by the plaintiff was that on the night of the 2nd of July, 1896, he, his wife, and a Mrs. Wright entered on Spadina Avenue coming from the west on a street called Harbord street; that on reaching Spadina Avenue they looked down south on that avenue to a place called Knox College Crescent to see if there was a railway car coming up; that they could see down to the crescent and there was then no car on Spadina Avenue north of the crescent; that thus finding there was no danger to be apprehended they proceeded north at the rate of a little over eight miles an hour on their way to the plaintiff\u2019s home close to Bloor street; that while so going north the plaintiff went on the east track, Mrs. Wright to his left on the strip between the up and down tracks called the devil\u2019s strip, and the plaintiff\u2019s wife to the left of Mrs. Wright; that he, the plaintiff, continued on the east track apprehending no danger until on reaching Sussex street which crosses the avenue at the distance of 531 feet from Harbord street he was suddenly run down by a motor car going north and carried forward by the car for a distance exceeding 200 feet; that the sound of a gong and the flash of a light from the bull\u2019s eye on the car was the only notice he had of the car, when on his instantly turning to the right to get off the track and to endeavour to avoid collision he was struck by the car simultaneously with the sound of the gong and the flash of the light; that in the plaintiff\u2019s opinion the car was going fully at the rate of twenty miles an hour. There can be no doubt that the car must have been going at a very excessive rate of speed to have overtaken the plaintiff at the distance of 531 feet from Harbord street if he was travelling even only at six instead of eight miles an hour, and if, as affirmed, there was no car on Spadina Avenue north of Knox College Crescent when he proceeded north from Harbord street, and if, as appearing in evidence the plaintiff was carried over 200 feet from where he was struck while it was proved that a car travelling at the rate of eight or nine miles an hour could be readily stopped within the length of at most two cars or sixty feet. The ladies riding with the plaintiff gave their evidence in support of that of the plaintiff. As to the rate of speed they did not assume to state a rate per hour at which the car was going, but they said that it was travelling at a rate twice as fast or more than the usual rate of speed which they had repeated opportunities of observing and had observed on Spadina Avenue. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence was also supported by an independent party who having entered on Spadina Avenue from the east on Classic Avenue, the street next south of Harbord street, also rode up the eastern track of the railway going, as he said, from eight to ten miles an hour and faster than the plaintiff whom he was overtaking and who, when witness reached Morris street, was approaching Sussex street where the collision took place, and the next street north of Morris street. When this witness reached Morris street he went off the track on to the blocked road on the east for the purpose of avoiding being run over by this same car from which he very narrowly escaped. In fine the plaintiff\u2019s contention was rested upon the evidence of twelve witnesses including himself, and that of the defendants upon the evidence of eighteen witnesses whom they called. The whole of this evidence fills 175 pages of printed matter taken down at the trial which was very protracted having extended over a period exceeding four days during which the jury had the fullest opportunity of estimating the value of the evidence. Having given a short substance of the case as presented by the plaintiff it is meet that I should, for the purpose of this appeal, state what the case of the defendants, as presented at the trial, was. This appears by a reference to a report made to the defendants at the time of the occurrence of the accident by the motorman in charge of the car which struck the plaintiff and by a brief summary of that motorman\u2019s evidence at the trial.\nThe report is as follows:\nGoing up Spadina Avenue, July 2nd, 1896, time 10.20 P.M., I saw two ladies and one gentleman on bicycles 500 feet ahead of me. I struck the gong several times. They kept going on at a slow rate of speed north, on the down track. When I came almost up to them the gentleman suddenly turned to cross in front of motor. The motor struck him; I just had time to shout and apply the brake. Policeman Young, No. 55, heard me strike the gong, and saw the man try to cross in front of the motor.\n(Sgd.) P. O\u2019NEILL,\nMotorman.\nThe policeman here named was called by the plaintiff.\nO\u2019Neill in his evidence at the trial said that when he came near to Classic Avenue he noticed some people coming out of Harbord street on bicycles; they were separated and strung out on the west track, not close together; that the east track upon which his car was travelling, was clear. That shortly afterwards he noticed a man on a wheel wobbling in front of him. Whether or not this man was the one whom he had seen with the ladies on the west track he could not say, but there was a man wobbling in front of him, turning in and out, zigzagging, sometimes on his track, sometimes not; that he rang the gong just in the ordinary way; that he was then pretty well up to Morris street, close to Morris street or somewhere along there; that from that time he kept his eye upon him, just in the ordinary way; that he did not particularly notice them more than other bicyclists going along; then he wobbled off; that shortly afterwards again a man turned in, in front of him; that he could not tell whether this was the man who had got in at Harbord street or not; that the witness struck the gong again, and that the man turned off, clear out off the strip, off the rails altogether, off the east side, off the up track; that then the witness came along so that the three bicycles were under his observation; that he saw the two ladies and one gentleman; that they were wheeling along leisurely, apparently in conversation; that he, witness, was ringing the gong in the usual way; that he had struck the gong different times going along in the usual way; that when he came to Sussex street the two ladies were in front of the gentleman; that they were on the north side, all three on the west track, or one of the ladies might have been on the block pavement; that no one was on the devil\u2019s strip or the east track; that just as he passed the first or south trolley pole on Sussex Avenue he was looking at them, and the gentleman then suddenly turned leisurely across; that witness was ringing his gong before the gentleman came on to his, the east track at all; that before his wheel got on over to the up or east track, that he, witness, had rung the gong and applied the brake, and there was a collision just about the boulevard at the north side. Witness did not say at what rate of speed per mile he was travelling but just said that he was going at the usual speed. This was the substance of the defence as relied upon by the defendants at the trial.\nIn short the whole contest at the trial was, whether as contended by the plaintiff the defendant\u2019s negligence was the sole cause of the accident, or on the contrary, as insisted upon by the defendants, the rash, negligent and reckless conduct of the plaintiff himself. The plaintiff and his witnesses were subjected to a rigid cross-examination for the purpose of establishing that the testimony of the plaintiff and his witnesses was wholly unreliable, and that of the witnesses for the defence alone reliable, and so that the plaintiff was himself the sole cause of the disaster which befell him and that no negligence whatever was established against the defendants.\nThe learned trial judge in a charge, of which the defendants have no reason to complain, submitted to the jury the following questions:\n1. Was the railway company guilty of any negligence in running the motor car?\n2. In what did the negligence, if any, consist?\n3. Was such negligence the cause of the accident?\n4. At what rate of speed was the car running at the time of the accident?\n5. Could Rowan by the exercise of reasonable care and diligence have avoided the accident?\n6. If the plaintiff is entitled to recover at what do you assess the damages?\nThese questions the jury answered as follows:\nTo the 1st they answered, \u201cyes.\u201d\nTo the 2nd they answered, \u201crunning too fast.\u201d\nTo the 3rd they answered, \u201cyes.\u201d\nTo the 4th they answered, \u201c16 miles an hour.\u201d\nTo the 5th they answered, \u201cwe believe that it could have been possible.\u201d\nTo the 6th they answered, \u201c$1,500.\u201d It is upon the answer to the 5th question that the principal appeal turns. The courts below have construed that answer as a verdict of the jury that the plaintiff was himself guilty of negligence, which contributed to the disaster, and accordingly the trial judge rendered judgment for the defendants, dismissing the action but without costs. The Court of Appeal at Toronto have affirmed this judgment. Now it is to be observed that there is nothing in the evidence to show that the defendants ever contended that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. They never rested their defence upon so low a ground. Their contention always was that they were guilty of no negligence whatever, and that the disaster from which the plaintiff suffered was occasioned wholly and solely by what they charge to have been his own rash, reckless, foolish conduct. Contributory negligence was never relied upon nor mentioned by the defendants. If the plaintiff\u2019s conduct was such as was said by the witnesses called by the defendants, and upon which they relied, such conduct would have established not what is known as and called contributory negligence of the plaintiff but would have fully established the contention of the defendants that the collision was caused solely by the rash and reckless conduct of the plaintiff himself. Upon this contention they still rely and contend that there was no evidence of negligence upon the part of the defendants to be submitted to the jury, and that the finding that the defendant\u2019s car was running too fast was not a finding of negligence, and that there was no evidence to shew, even assuming the car to have been running at sixteen miles an hour, that such speed was dangerous. The only evidence to the effect that the plaintiff had conducted himself as alleged by the defendants, was that given by witnesses who, in the same breath that they described the conduct of the plaintiff, testified that the motor car was not running at an excessive rate of speed and that the motor man by every means in his power was endeavouring to avoid the collision which as they said was wholly occasioned by the plaintiff\u2019s own rash and reckless conduct. It is in my opinion quite impossible to construe the answer of the jury to the 5th question as a verdict of contributory negligence against the plaintiff. The case must be dealt with as one wherein it is established by the answers of the jury to the first four questions that the accident was caused as charged by the plaintiff by the negligence of the defendants, which negligence consisted in the motor car having been run at a rate of speed which the jury have pronounced to have been excessive. A plaintiff to whom contributory negligence is imputed has as much right to insist that the defendants upon whom the onns probandi rests shall specify with as much certainty and prove the act or acts of negligence relied upon, and that the jury should specify what is the act of negligence of the plaintiff, if any they find, which contributed to the disaster, as the defendants have to insist that the plaintiff should specify and prove the act or acts which he relies upon as constituting the negligence of the defendants charged as having caused the disaster; and that the jury should find what negligence of the defendants, if any, was the cause of the accident in the case submitted to them. It may and frequently does happen that the state of alarm in which a person is put upon finding himself exposed to imminent danger to life or limb causes him to take a course which in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence he would not take, and by so doing to increase his risk and in fact bring about the catastrophe which he was endeavouring to avoid; but the taking in such case of a wrong course would not justify a verdict of contributory negligence. In the present case, however, as already observed, the defendants did not rely upon any act of the plaintiff as constituting contributory negligence, nor did the learned judge in his charge to the jury submit to them any question as to contributory negligence if they should adopt the evidence of the plaintiff and his witnesses as to the cause of the accident having been the excessive speed at which, as charged by the plaintiff, the motor car was being propelled. In such case the evidence did not show any sufficient foundation upon which a verdict of contributory negligence should be supported.\nThe answer of the jury to the 5th question and that question itself must be read in the light of the charge of the learned judge when submitting the question and so read the answer seems to me to have an intelligent meaning very different from a verdict of contributory negligence. The learned judge in his charge to the jury said:\nNow I have explained to you fully the obligation of the company as to sounding the gong so as to give warning to any vehicle or pedestrian or one who was riding as this plaintiff was on a bicycle. If they gave warning in time to enable him to leave the track, and were not running at an excessive rate of speed at the time, then if he heard or should have heard the warning given and still remained on the track you may reach the conclusion that he was guilty of what is called contributory negligence.\nNow the learned judge here in express terms excludes from the question as to contributory negligence, the element or fact of the car having been run at an excessive rate of speed, and for the reason as it appears to me that in case the jury should be of opinion that the accident was caused by the excessive rate of speed at which the car was run they would necessarily be of that opinion by adopting the evidence of the plaintiff, and there appeared nothing in the evidence upon which in such a case a verdict of contributory negligence could be supported.\nFurther on the learned judge says:\nOf course, gentlemen of the jury, if he (the plaintiff) was on this strip as it is said he was (by the evidence offered by the defendant and relied upon by them) and went in front of the car after warning was given which he should have heard, and could have heard if he had been paying attention to it, if he went off the strip and on to the railway under these circumstances then he has no right to recover from this company.\nIn this latter clause the case was submitted precisely as the defendants had throughout contended the facts of the case were, and the jury must have so understood the charge, and if they had believed the defendants\u2019 witnesses it must, I think, be admitted that the defendants were, as they contended, entitled to a verdict to the effect that the plaintiff\u2019s own negligent, rash and reckless conduct was the sole cause of the accident, and that the jury upon the charge of the learned judge would have so found. But the jury\u2019s answers to the first four questions are quite in accordance with their rejection of the defendants\u2019 evidence and their acceptance and adoption of that of the plaintiff, and having answered those questions as they did they might well have considered they had disposed of the whole case as submitted to them and might have left the fifth question unanswered, but they perhaps thought that courtesy required that they should answer the questions submitted by the judge as best they could which was in the qualified manner that they did. The true meaning of such their answer as it appears to me is that answering the question in the light it was dealt with in the charge of the learned judge, they cannot say with any certainty but they believe that it could have been possible for the plaintiff to have avoided the accident if the conditions sug- gested by the learned judge in his charge had existed, that is to say\nif they gave him warning in time to enable him to leave the track and were not running at an excessive rate of speed at the time, &c.,\nas put by the learned judge in his charge.\nIn my opinion the appeal must be allowed with costs and judgment be ordered to be entered in the court below for the plaintiff for fifteen hundred dollars damages and the costs of the action. The evidence is abundantly sufficient to support the express finding of the jury that the accident was occasioned by reason of the excessive rate of speed at which the motor car was propelled as charged by the plaintiff.\nKING and GIROUARD JJ. concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: James Leith Boss.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Laidlaw, Kappele & Bicknell.\n[1] Flannery v.

It did not appear that there existed any cause such as set forth in the statute for the refusal of the confirmation of the certificate but the municipal council, (having received a guarantee from the Quebec Provincial Branch of the Dominion Alliance against damages, etc., which might result from their action in the matter), passed a resolution refusing to confirm the certificate without assigning any cause except that the majority of the members of the council were opposed to the sale of intoxicating liqueurs under any circumstances whatever. The plaintiff thereupon took an action for mandamus to compel the corporation to confirm the certificate, and by a judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal ([2]), it was ordered that a peremptory writ of mandamus should issue enjoining the council to confirm the certificate which was accordingly done. The plaintiff afterwards brought the present action for damages against the municipal corporation for the loss of business profits, expenses, etc., caused by the wrongful act as alleged of the council as above set forth. The Superior Court of Sherbrooke decided in favour of the plaintiff, but on appeal this judgment was reversed by the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench from which the present appeal is taken.\nH.

We think the appellant must fail in all these essential points\nThe council clearly had a discretion for the exercise of which no action will lie; further there is no evidence of malice (even if that would have sufficed), and such an action as this would not lie against the municipality, even if the two former essential grounds were established in the appellant's favour.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Brown & Macdonald\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

R. S. Q.\u201458 V. c. 36 (Que.).\nA writ of prohibition will not lie to prevent the execution of the sentence of an inferior tribunal where there has not been absence or excess of jurisdiction in the exercise of its powers.\nIn pursuance of statutory powers, the Bar of Montreal suspended a practising advocate after holding an inquiry into charges against him which, however, had been withdrawn by the private prosecutor before the council had considered the matter. It did not appear that witnesses had been examined upon oath during the inquiry and no notes in writing of the evidence of witnesses adduced had been taken the effect of such absence of written notes being that the appellant had been deprived of an opportunity of effectively prosecuting an appeal to the General Council of the Bar of the Province of Qu\u00e9bec. Held, affirming the judgment appealed from (Q. R. 8 Q. B. 26), that the local Council of the Bar of Montreal had \"jurisdiction to proceed with the inquiry in the interest of the profession not with-standing the withdrawal of the charge by the private prosecutor ; that a complaint in any form sufficient to disclose charges against an advocate of improperly carrying on trade and commerce and unduly retaining the money of a client, contrary to the by-laws of the local section of the bar, is a matter over which the Council of the Bar had complete jurisdiction, and further, that the omission to preserve a complete record of the proceedings upon the inquiry held by the council or to take written notes of the evidence of witnesses adduced, constituted mere irregularities in procedure which were insufficient to justify a writ of prohibition.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, appeal side ([1]), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal and maintaining the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which quashed a writ of prohibition sued out by the appellant with costs.\nA statement of the case will be found in the judgment of the court delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard.\nMcDougall Q.C. for the appellant. The appellant complains of the sentence of the Council of the Bar :\u2014 (1) Because the letter of complaint does not allege any offence that might give the Council of the Bar of Montreal jurisdiction ; (2) because no act is alleged which constitutes an offence at law, or under the rules of the Bar of the Province of Quebec ; (3) because the Council of the Bar of Montreal could not take action nor give a decision upon that complaint, and appellant was never summoned nor required to answer the charges ; (4) because the decision is arbitrary and unjust and contrary to law and to the by-law of the Bar of the Province of Quebec ; (5) because the decision does not allege any offence that could authorise such sentence; (6) because the complaint is entirely, false and had been withdrawn by the complainant ; (7) because the decision was ultra vires of the powers of the council, and no notes of evidence were taken or transmitted to the General Council ; (8) because there is no rule by the General Council of the Bar of the Province of Quebec which classes the acts with which the appellant is reproached in the complaint, as being derogatory to professional honour and dignity ; and (9) because the complainant had been given credit for the moneys in question upon his account due for professional services for a much larger amount before the complaint was made.\nProhibition is the appropriate remedy to stay the execution of the sentence O'Farrell v. Brassard ([2]); or for redress of the wrong sustained; Roberts v. Humby ([3]); Lloyd on Prohibition, pp. 11, 12 & 13; art. 2329 R. S. Q. Prohibition lies to restrain all courts whether or not courts of record, from proceeding in matters over which they have no jurisdiction ; or having jurisdiction, when the court has attempted to proceed by rules differing from those which ought to be observed ; The Queen v. Judicial Committee of Privy Council ([4]).\nEx parte Burke ([5]) establishes that for an error not apparent on the face of the proceedings and without objection as to the jurisdiction, recourse may be had to prohibition for setting aside a judgment of an inferior court. See also Mayor of London v. Cox ([6]) at page 241 and cases there cited. The appellant had a right to a regular summons before the tribunal which was to pass judgment on the pretended complaint The complaint was not made on oath and appellant did not receive a copy. We also refer to arts. 450 and 1031 C. C. P. ([7]) which apply to this case; art. 3523 R. S. Q. and 58 Vict. ch. 36, sec. 2 (Que.)\nGlobensky for the respondent. The council had full jurisdiction under art. 3527 R. S. Q., and consequently prohibition cannot lie; Molson v. Lambe ([8]); Wood on Prohibition, pp. 141, 147; Short on Information\u2019s, 771; Spelling on Extraordinary Relief, par. 1760. A writ of prohibition can only issue for excess of jurisdiction; Re Beaudry ([9]); Lalibert\u00e9 v. Fortin ([10]).\nSince the repeal of arts. 3569-3596, R. S. Q., regulating proceedings before the council ([11]), there is no necessity for taking notes in writing of the evidence in such cases, nor to take that evidence upon oath. The new regulations do not even give power to administer an oath in such proceedings. The third section of the repealing Act details the new procedure and permits the exercise of wide discretion as to the verification of such charges. The provision for an appeal cannot be construed as requiring either the administration of an oath or written notes of evidence. The state of the statutes leaves this case under the application of the maxim omnia pr\u00e6sumuntur etc.\nBy the new statute the council has become a domestic tribunal in disciplinary matters and requires no precise form of information or complaint, and may exercise discretion both as to inquiry and sentence to the exclusion of all courts, subject only to the appeal of the General Council of the Bar Art. 3537, R. S. Q. The by-law in respect to offences against professional honour and dignity clearly covers the present case. At most, the manner of procedure can constitute nothing more than an irregularity which affords no ground for prohibition. The appellent did not take these objections before the council but acquiesced in the procedure and continued to acknowledge both the jurisdiction and procedure of the domestic forum in following up his remedy by appeal to the General Council.\nThe discontinuance by the private prosecutor cannot affect the validity of the sentence. The disciplinary power in the council remained intact and could not be removed by a settlement between the parties. Comparing the arr\u00eat on a similar point referred to by Mellot, R\u00e8gles de la Profession d'Avocat, no. 499, p. 279. We also refer to the O'Farrell Case ([12]); Duval v. H\u00e9bert ([13]); Bergevin v. Rouleau ([14]); Simard v. Corporation of Montmorency ([15]); Mayor of Sorel v. Armstrong ([16]).\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The Bar of the Province of Quebec constitutes a general corporation having jurisdiction over the whole province and is divided into districts or sections which are local corporations. Thus, the Bar of Montreal forms a section and a separate corporation subject in certain cases to the higher jurisdiction or control of the council of the general corporation, called the General Council of the Bar of the Province of Quebec. Both the general corporation and the corporations of sections may pass by-laws for matters of general interest to their respective bodies and to the members thereof, but the by-laws of a section must not conflict with those of the general council. The general corporation has power to make by-laws\nfor maintaining the honour and dignity of the bar and discipline among its members, and also\nfor defining and enumerating the professions, trades, occupations, business or offices incompatible with the dignity of the profession of advocate as well as the offices or charges incompatible with the practice of the profession.\nThe statute then indicates how the delinquents are to be dealt with. The Revised Statutes of Quebec (Art. 3527), says:\nEach council of a section has power:\n1.To pronounce, as the importance of the case may require, a censure or reprimand against any member of the section guilty of any breach or discipline, or of any act derogatory to the honour or dignity of the bar, or who is convicted of exercising or of having filled any position or office the occupation of which is incompatible with the profession of advocate, of exercising any calling or trade, of being engaged in any industry, or of carrying on any business, or holding any office inconsistent with the dignity of a member of the bar, or of having infringed the by-laws of the general council or of the council of his section.\n2. To deprive such member of the right of voting, and of the right of attending the meetings of the section, for any term, in the discretion of the council, not exceeding five years.\nThe council of such section may also, according to the gravity of the offence, punish such member by suspending him from his functions for any period whatsoever, in the discretion of the said council, and may deprive him forever of the right of practising his profession.\nIn default of a by-law of the general council applicable to a particular case the council of the section decides definitely to the exclusion of all courts, subject only to appeal to the general council, whether the act complained of is derogatory to the honour or dignity of the bar, or against the discipline of the members, if the position or office is incompatible with the practice of the profession of advocate, and the calling trade or industry, business or onice is inconsistent with the dignity of the profession.\nThe Quebec Statute, 58 Vict. ch. 36 (1895), says:\n3. Article 3527 of the said statutes is amended:\nb. By adding thereto the two following paragraphs:\n4. In the exercise of the powers conferred by this article, the councils proceed deliberately and may have recourse to all means they deem expedient to ascertain the facts to be verified, and to allow the accused to defend himself; 5. Every decision of a council of a section which entails the dismissal, suspension or other punishment of a member of the bar, is subject to appeal to the general council.\nThis constitution of the Bar of Quebec will be found in the revised statutes of the province, art. 3504 and following, except the last two paragraphs which were enacted in 1895 by 58 Vict. ch. 36.\nThe mode of procedure to be followed in the trial of the accused was thus materially changed. Under sections 3569 and 3596 R. S. Q. the complaint had to be made under oath the witnesses sworn (art. 3577) proof taken down in writing (art. 3575), and on appeal the record was transmitted etc., (art. 3586). All these rules are repealed by 58 Vict. ch. 36. s. 11, and replaced by the section quoted above, which simply provides that the councils may have recourse to all means they deem expedient to ascertain the facts to be verified. The appeal to the general council is instituted by a mere letter addressed to the secretary-treasurer of such council containing a copy of the decision, and there-upon it is decided summarily. 58 Vict. ch. 36, s. 3.\nIt is apparent that the Legislature has armed the councils of the Bar of Quebec with discretionary powers which may inflict serious if not irreparable injury upon its members and also to the public. Carr\u00e9, Lois de la Proc\u00e9dure (3rd ed.), Int. n. 10, says that\nles r\u00e8gles et les formalit\u00e9s de la proc\u00e9dure \u00e9cartent en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'administraci\u00f3n de Ia justice le d\u00e9sordre, l'arbitraire et Ia confusion.\nThe pr\u00e9sent case is an illustration of this result. The councils of the bar are bound by no rules of procedure except \"to allow the accused to defend himself.\" He must therefore be summoned to appear and be allowed to defend himself, but how? And what rules will protect his defence? The statute has left all that to the discretion of the tribunal. It is not even necessary that there should be a private information. The Initiative may be taken by the council or by a member thereof called the Syndic.\nClause 2 of 58 Vict. ch. 36 says:\n2 Article 3523 of the said statutes as amended by the same section of the said Act is further amended by adding thereto the following:\nThe syndic is specially charged with the supervision of the discipline of the bar. He is bound immediately to denounce to the council of the section any infringement of the by-laws, all conduct of any member derogatory to the honour of the bar, and to submit to it any accusation for similar acts which is handed to him by any person, saving the right of the council to receive the same directly or to take the initiative in the exercise of its disciplinary powers.\nThe appellant, who is an old practising advocate of the Bar of Montreal, complains of a decision of its council which suspended him during three months, and by writ of prohibition demands that the Bar be prohibited from executing the sentence for, in sub-stance, three reasons, first, because the private complaint does not allege any offence in law or under the by-laws of the Bar that might give jurisdiction to the council of the Bar of Montreal ; secondly, because the council did not take any note in writing of the evidence adduced, so as to permit the appellant to have its decision revised and reversed ; and thirdly because the private prosecutor, Labbe, had withdrawn his charge against the appellant.\nThe two last reasons are unfounded. Notwithstanding the d\u00e9sistement, the Bar could proceed with the inquiry in the interest of the profession. All the courts were against the appellant upon this point. The appellant adduced evidence before the local council but did not request that it should be taken in writing and it was not so taken. The local council perhaps inferred from his course that he never intended to appeal upon the sufficiency of the evidence, but (if an appeal was contemplated at all) l only upon the sufficiency of the charge. In appeal, he found himself without any proof, and although he offered to summon again his witnesses, his appeal was dismissed summarily by the general council.\nThe local council should not have taken for granted that the appeal would be limited, and the moment that the sentence pronounced opened the door of the general council they should have seen that it was susceptible of revision. This was undoubtedly a great hardship to the appellant, but it constituted a mere irregularity or illegality in the proceedings which cannot justify the issue of a writ of prohibition. Even the rejection or refusal of legal evidence will not affect the jurisdiction of the tribunal Ex parte Higgins ([17]); Am. & Eng. Ancy. of Pleading, vo. Prohibition (2 ed.) pp. 1108, 1125, 1126, 1127; see also Molson v. Lambe ([18]); The Governor and Company of Adventurers of England v Joannette ([19]; Mackonochie v. Lord Penzance ([20]), per Lord Blackburn; Reid v. Graham ([21]).\nThe only question in the case is really that of jurisdiction The Code of Procedure lays down this principle (art. 1031), which is taken from the English common law:\nWrits of prohibition are addressed to the courts of inferior jurisdiction whenever they exceed their jurisdiction.\nSee also R. S. Q. art. 2329.\nHas the council of the Bar of Montreal exceeded its jurisdiction? Jurisdiction is claimed both under the statute and the by-laws. We have quoted the statutes in full; we will now see what the by-laws provide for. The by-laws of the general council, passed on the 16th September, 1886, sec. II, art. 6 say:\nThe following are declared incompatible with the dignity of the legal profession; the carrying on for pecuniary profit of any handicraft, industry, trade or commerce. etc; and art. 7:\nThe following actions, among others are derogatory to the honour and dignity of the profession, viz.: par. 6. Any breach of trust (abus de confiance) by an advocate to the detriment of client * *\npar. 11. To unduly withhold the monies, documents and papers of clients\nThe complaint made against the appellant reads as follows:\nMontr\u00e9al, mai 20, 1895.\nArthur Globe sky, Ecru.,\nSyndic du Barreau de Montr\u00e9al.\nCher Monsieur, R\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 Ia plainte qui vous a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite contre M.

E. BERNARD,\nMontr\u00e9al, 9 juin, 1886.\nSecr\u00e9taire du Barreau,\nThe appellant appealed to the General Council, but on the 29th October, 1895, his appeal was summarily dismissed there being no evidence before the appellate tribunal which moreover refused to hear the witnesses de novo or send the case back to the local council for the purpose of obtaining written evidence, and of allowing the appellant to defend himself. The judgment in appeal reads as follows:\nIt is decided by the General Council of the Bar that Martin Honan, Esquire a member of the Bar of the Section of Montreal who has appealed to this Council from a decision of the Council of his section of the twenty-sixth of June last, suspending him from his functions as an advocate for a period of three months, having failed to show any good or sufficient reason why the said decision should be set aside, his appeal therefrom be rejected.\nQuebec, February 26th, 1896.\nW. C. LANGUEDOC,\nSec.-Treas. Gen. C.B.P.Q.\nThereupon, the appellant applied for a writ of prohibition to prevent the local council from carrying the sentence into execution. The Superior Court (J. Alp. Ouimet J.) quashed the writ of prohibition. The Court of Review (Tasch-ereau, Grill and Mathieu JJ.) reversed this judgment, which was however, restored by the Court of Appeal (3 to 2) Boss\u00e9 Blanchet and Hall JJ.; contra W\u00fcrtele and Ouimet JJ. :\nConsid\u00e9rant que le Bref de Prohibition ne peut \u00eatre adress\u00e9 \u00e0 un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur que lorsqu'il agit sans juridiction ou l'exc\u00e8de au cours de ses proc\u00e9dures et que l'on ne peut y recourir uniquement pour faire reformer ses d\u00e9cisions quelqu'erron\u00e9es qu'elles soient ;\nConsid\u00e9rant que les faits contenus dans la plainte soumise au Conseil du Barreau de Montr\u00e9al savoir : que I'intim\u00e9 aurait obtenu une somme de soixante piastres pour inscrire en r\u00e9vision un jugement renvoyant une saisie-arr\u00eat que l'intim\u00e9 avait fait \u00e9maner, comme procureur du plaignant, tandis qu'il avait alors lui-m\u00eame r\u00e9gl\u00e9 l'affaire avec les avocats de la partie adverse qui lui avait aussi pay\u00e9 ses frais, constitue, prim\u00e2 facie, une faute grave, un abus de confiance regrettable et par cons\u00e9quent un acte derogator \u00e0 l'honneur professional et \u00e0 Ia dignit\u00e9 du Barreau, et que m\u00eame en admettant que l'intim\u00e9 aurait eu un int\u00e9r\u00eat dans Ia proc\u00e9dure en question comme associ\u00e9 du plaignant, sous le nom de son \u00e9pouse, et avait en outre une r\u00e9clamation de deux cents piastres \u00e0 exercer contre le plaignant pour honoraires et d\u00e9bours\u00e9s, ces faits ne pouvaient soustraire l'acte reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 au contr\u00f4le disciplinaire du conseil de la section \u00e0 laquelle il appartient d'emp\u00eacher cette derni\u00e8re de proc\u00e9der sur la plainte qui lui \u00e9tait soumise, la loi lui donne juridiction sur tous les actes professionnels de ses membres sans exception et sans distinction ;\nConsid\u00e9rant que le Conseil du Barreau de Montr\u00e9al avait partant juridiction pour entendre et d\u00e9cider cette plainte, et que les all\u00e9gu\u00e9s qu'il aurait adjug\u00e9 sans preuve ou contrairement aux faits, et n'aurait pas pris l'enqu\u00eate par \u00e9crit ou par notes (arts. 236,243,264, 266 C.

This court is not sitting in appeal from the decision of the Council of the Bar or even on a writ of certiorari but on a writ of prohibition, and, therefore, we have no power to look into the evidence adduced on the merits much less to appreciate the same, however favourable it might be to the appellant.\nMembers of a corporation who submit to extraordinary powers like these enjoyed by the Bar of the Province of Quebec \"to the exclusion of all courts \" have no reason to expect relief from courts of justice, except when there is absence or excess of jurisdiction. The appeal is therefore dismissed, but without costs, as was done by the Court of Appeal. We would go even further. The wrong inflicted by the Bar of Montreal upon the appellant\u2014in not allowing him to effectively prosecute his appeal\u2014is so serious, so grave in its consequences, that it should be a sufficient reason for the Bar not to carry out the sentence pronounced and we hope that the Bar of Montreal will be satisfied with this recognition of its supreme authority.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Martin Honan.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Globensky & Lamarre.\n[1] Q.

APPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nThe plaintiff, an employee of the defendant company, while engaged in coupling and uncoupling cars, attempted to step from between two cars when the train backed up, but his feet became entangled in the long grass and weeds which had grown over the roadbed and he was struck by the train and seriously injured. In an action against the company for damages a verdict was entered for the defendant contrary to the findings of the jury, and this verdict was sustained by the full court. The plaintiff then appealed to this court.\nJoseph Martin Q.C. for the appellant, referred to Webster v. Foley[2]; Penny v. Wimbledon Urban District Council[3] ; Groves v. Wimborne [4].\nNesbitt Q.C. for the respondent, cited Johnson v. Lindsay & Co.[5] ; Williams v. Bartling[6] ; Williams v. Birmingham Battery & Metal Co.[7].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by :\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an action to recover damages for an injury to the appellant, the plaintiff in the action, caused as it is alleged by the respondents' negligence.\nThe respondents in their defence deny the negligence imputed to them, and also set up that if the appellant was injured by the negligence of any one it was by that of a fellow servant of the appellant, in the same employment.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Irving and a special jury. The evidence given at the trial has not been printed and we have not been furnished with a copy of it by the appellant, as it was suggested at the hearing of the appeal that we should be. It appears, however, from the factum of both parties that the only neglect of duty imputed to the respondents was that set forth in the statement of claim, namely, \"having the track in a dangerous condition from the growth of long grass and weeds\" in which the appellant's foot became entangled and so led to the accident. The learned judge left several questions to the jury, who found that there was negligence on the part of the respondents, and assessed the damages at $6,500. Notwithstanding this finding, and upon the evidence which he was entitled to consider, the judge entered the judgment for the respondents. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court en banc this judgment was affirmed.\nAlthough the point does not seem to have been taken either at the trial or on the appeal, it appears to us that there was no evidence of negligence upon which the jury could have reasonably found for the appellant. It was the duty of the judge to determine whether there was any evidence of negligence proper to be submitted to the jury. This involves the consideration of matters of fact, and in determining it judges are to bring to bear their common experience of such matters as jurors have to do in questions of fact left to their decision. This is so well settled by the highest authority that there can be no question of the correctness of the principle. Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Co. v. Slattery [8] ; Flannery v. Water-ford and Limerick Railway Co.[9]. It is not of course every omission to do something which would have avoided an accident which constitutes negligence in law. In order that a duty should be imposed upon a person the neglect of which constitutes an actionable wrong, it must be apparent that the want of care or attention is reasonably likely to endanger the safety of others. It is not sufficient that the omission did in fact cause an accident, if it was not to some extent obvious that such a consequence was likely to result from it.\nThis is, it is true, to a great extent a question of degree but still it is one which it is held must be dealt with by the judge in deciding the preliminary question whether there is any evidence proper to be left to the jury. Crafter v. The Metropolitan Railway Co.[10], was a case in which this rule was acted upon, and so far as I can judge from the meagre report of the case of Smithwhile v. Moore[11] it was also there applied by Mr. Justice Phillimore. Can it then be said in the present case that the permitting grass and weeds to grow on the side track was so obviously likely to result in danger to the respondents' employees that it constituted negligence ? In point of fact no doubt we must assume that the accident to the appellant resulted from such growth but that, as has been said, is not conclusive. The brass facings on the stairs in the case of Crafter v. The Railway Co.[12] led to the accident in question there, but it was not held to establish negligence, nor was the broken pane of glass in the action which came before Phillimore J. I am of opinion that in the present case the not keeping down the natural growth of weeds and grass was not such an omission as could reasonably have been foreseen to be likely to endanger the safety of the railway servants working upon the track.\nUpon the other point also, that of common employment, upon which the court below proceeded, the judgment is, we think, in all respects right. The duty of keeping the line of railway and the side tracks in proper order was delegated to the respondents' road-master and section foreman who were shown to be properly qualified, and if there was any failure to perform a duty which the respondents owed to the appellant, it was they who were guilty of it, and as they were for the purposes of the defence of common employment fellow servants of the appellant, the action fails.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Martin & Deacon.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Davis, Marshall & Macneill.\n[1] 6 B.

(Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1899: October 26, 27; 1899: November 29.\nPresent: Sir Henry Strong C.J. and Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick and King JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Construction of railway\u2014Certificate of engineer\u2014Condition precedent.\nWhere the contract for construction of a railway provided that the work was to be done to the satisfaction of the chief engineer of a railway company, not a party to such contract, who was to be the sole and final arbiter of all disputes between the parties, the contractor was not bound by such condition when the party named as arbiter proved to be, in fact, the engineer of the other party to the contract. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of Armour C.J. at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe facts of the case are thus stated by Mr. Justice Osler in the Court of Appeal.\nThe defendants, the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company, were incorporated some years prior to the year 1889, for the purpose of constructing a railway, part of the main line of which was from Brantford to Welland, passing through the City of Hamilton. Soon afterwards a construction company, incorporated in the State of Illinois under the name of J.N. Young & Co., was organized for the purpose of building the road, one J.N. Young being the chief promoter of the concern.\nJ.N. Young & Co. became the owners of, or took up the greater part of, the stock of the railway company, putting up the 10 per cent required to be paid before its organization, and they created the local board of directors, qualifying the individuals who composed it by giving them the necessary shares.\nThey then entered into a contract, on the 2nd June, 1891, with the railway company through the medium of this board of directors for the construction of the line of railway or part of it. Into the particulars of this contract it is not necessary to enter, inasmuch as the financial operations of that corporation being unsuccessful they were unable to carry it out, and thereupon Young procured a new company, the defendants the Dominion Construction Company, to be incorporated under the laws of New Jersey, which acquired the rights and interests of the old one under their contract with the railway company, and succeeded in building the line. The new company, on the 4th of September, 1894. entered into a contract with the railway company, the directors of which stood in the same position towards them as they did to the former, by which for a bulk sum of $35,000 per mile they agreed to survey, locate and construct the railway company\u2019s line of railway and telegraph from its present terminus east of Brantford to and through the City of Hamilton to a connection with the Canada Southern Railway at or near Welland, and form a connection with that railway at Hamilton to Toronto. They also agreed to construct a second main track between the latter points, if required, at a bulk sum of $20,000 per mile. The railway was to be constructed on such line as the chief engineer of the railway company should locate and adopt, and in accordance with the specifications attached to and forming part of the contract. The provisions of the contract for securing payment of the contract price need not be referred to further than to say that the whole of the assets of the railway company of every kind then owned or thereafter to be acquired were pledged and to be secured for that purpose in the manner set forth in this contract. It was stipulated that the railway company should appoint a chief engineer who should have entire charge of the engineering department of the railway company. His decision upon all questions that might arise in connection with the contract as to its true meaning and intent so far as the work of construction was concerned was to be final and binding on all parties, and his salary and compensation were to be paid by the construction company. It was provided that the construction company should have the right by its president, general manager, or any director, to be present at any directors\u2019 meeting of the railway company, and to discuss any resolution or motion before the meeting. On the 10th of July, 1895, the contract between the Dominion Construction Company and Good & Co., the plaintiffs, out of which the present litigation arises, was entered into. By it Good & Co. covenanted to build the eastern branch of the railway, viz., that part of the line between Hamilton and Welland, and to complete it \u201cto the satisfaction and acceptance of the chief engineer of the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Co.\u201d The company covenanted to pay them for the work in accordance with the scheduled prices specified in the contract. Progress estimates, \u201cto be judged of by the said chief engineer,\u201d were to be presented at the end of each month, and 90 per cent thereof to be paid by the 20th of the following month. \u201cAnd when all the work embraced in this contract is fully completed agreeably to the specifications and in accordance with the direction, and to the satisfaction and acceptance, of the said chief engineer, there shall be a final estimate made of the character, quality and value of the work according to the terms of this agreement, when the balance appearing due to Good & Co., shall be paid to them within thirty days thereafter upon their giving a release in full to the company of all claims arising in any manner out of the agreement, and upon their procuring and delivering to the company full releases from mechanics, material men, etc., for work done and materials supplied under the contract.\u201d The procuring of such releases was to be a condition precedent to the right of Good & Co., to payment.\nGood & Co. agreed not to sublet or transfer the contract or any part of it without the written consent of the chief engineer. By a further clause it was provided that the decision of the chief engineer was to be final and conclusive in any dispute which might arise between the parties relative to or touching the agree- ment, each party reserving any right of action by virtue of the covenants, so that the decision of the chief engineer should be in the nature of an award, and final and conclusive.\nThe plaintiffs proceeded with their contract, and it was, within what may be called a reasonably short time after the date fixed for its completion, finished to the satisfaction and acceptance of the chief engineer of the railway company. The plaintiffs were by consent relieved of some part of the work of ballasting the line, and no question arises about that. The road was also accepted by the engineer as completed as between the construction company and the railway. But when it came to the question of procuring the final estimate required by the plaintiffs\u2019 contract, difficulties arose respecting the classification of certain portions of the work which the plaintiffs contended should be classified as loose rock, for which the engineer was prepared to allow no more than 98 M cubic yards, while the plaintiffs claimed 150 M. The difference between the two figures the engineer thought should be classified as earth excavation only, although in his original estimate for the purpose of the contract he had put the whole at the large figure which the plaintiffs asserted had been found as a matter of actual work on the ground as shown on the progress estimates to be nearly right. There were also differences between the parties as to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for extras, and in respect of a claim for what is described in the specifications as the \u201cforce\u201d account\u2014differences which by the terms of the contract were doubtless required to be decided by the engineer, but which the parties endeavoured, but without success, to settle between themselves after the contract had been completed and the works accepted by him. On the 17th of March, 1896, the engineer gave the plaintiffs a qualified or conditional final estimate as to quantities and character of the work, but not \u201cmoneyed out,\u201d and upon the understanding, as he stated in his letter accompanying it, \u201cthat an amicable settlement is made between Good & Co. and the construction company upon items under consideration,\u201d i.e., the extras and force account. It was not intended as a final estimate upon which the plaintiffs could obtain judgment, and on their part they were not prepared to accept it because of the alleged improper classification. With regard to this classification the plaintiffs\u2019 contention was that the chief engineer had never, by actual inspection of the ground while the work was being proceeded with, acquired a knowledge of the ground and of the character of the work, which justified him in making, in the final estimate, so radical a change in the classification which had from time to time been made in respect of it in the progress estimates based on the reports of the sub-engineers who saw the work while it was being done.\nIt appeared that not long after the plaintiffs had commenced their work on the contract they were informed, as they said, by the engineer, but which he denied, that he was \u201cinterested\u201d in the contract, in what way they did not know, but they assumed in the profits. They did not, however, object to his acting, and they received some seven progress estimates certified by him. It was proved that he was not in fact so interested, and that he was not a member of the construction company. During the attempt at a settlement, and while the plaintiffs were endeavouring without success to obtain the final estimate, they were also complaining that Wingate, the engineer, owing to his long connection with Young, was not in a position to deal fairly with them. It may be noticed here that the plaintiffs sublet several portions of the works they had contracted to execute. There was no written consent on the part of the railway company\u2019s engineer to their doing so, but he was aware that it was done either at the time or shortly afterwards, and no objection was ever made by him. These contracts required that a final estimate should likewise be obtained by the sub-contractors from the railway company\u2019s engineer. These he refused to give at the instance of Young, acting on behalf of the Dominion Construction Company.\nAt the trial before Armour C.J. judgment was given against all the defendants except the railway company. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, but varied by a direction that as against Wingate, the engineer, the action should be dismissed, but without costs.\nD\u2019Arcy Tate for the appellant.\nAylesworth Q.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014At the conclusion of the argument of the counsel for the appellant I was of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Appeal was right and the appeal ought to be dismissed.\nMr. Wingate was certainly in such a position, and his conduct was such that the learned Chief Justice was, on the evidence, entirely right in absolving the contractors Good & Co. from the necessity of obtaining his certificate. The authorities on this head are so numerous and so conclusive as to make it unnecessary to refer to them after the references already made in the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal have treated Mr. Wingate with great leniency in dismissing the action against him without costs. I should have preferred to have retained him as a defendant and have ordered him to pay costs as Chief Justice Armour\u2019s judgment did, but this is a mere matter of costs, and the respondents have not asked by way of cross-appeal to have the order varied.\nUnder the judgment as it stands nothing is said about releases, and as the provision in the contract requiring them seems to be only by way of a condition precedent to obtaining a certificate, and as there is now to be no certificate, there is strictly no reason why there should be any direction respecting them. The appellants may, however, if they elect so to do, have an inquiry as to whether there are any mechanics\u2019 liens or other charges affecting the monies payable under the contract. In all other respects the original judgment as varied by the Court of Appeal will stand. Subject to such variation, if the appellants elect to take the direction for an inquiry, the appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Carscallen & Cahill.\nSolicitor for the respondents: S.F. Washington.\n[1] 26 Ont. App. R. 133, sub nom. Good v. Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Co.\n"}

He then went to New York where he carried on the business of buying and selling stocks and securities having offices for such business and living at a hotel paying for a room in the latter only when occupied. During the next four years he spent about four months in each at St. John visiting his children and taking recreation. He had no business interests there but attended meetings of the directors of the Bank of New Brunswick during his yearly visits. He was never personally taxed in New York and took no part in municipal matters there. Being assessed in 1897 on personal property in St. John he appealed against the assessment unsuccessfully and then applied for a writ of certiorari with a view to having it quashed.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, that as there had been a long continued actual residence by J. in New York, and as on his appeal against the assessment he had avowed his bond fide intention of making it his home permanently, or at least for an indefinite time, and his determination not to return to St. John to reside, he had acquired a new home or domicile and that in St. John had been abandoned within the meaning of the Act. Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick discharging a rule nisi for certiorari to quash an assessment against the appellant.\nThe only question raised on this appeal was whether or not the appellant, Jones, had abandoned his domicile in St. John by acquiring one in New York, and consequently whether or not he was liable to be personally assessed in the former city. The facts upon which the decision of the question depended are sufficiently stated in the above note and fully set out in the judgment of the court on this appeal.\nCurrey Q.C. for the appellant.\nC. J. Coster for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nKING J.\u2014The question in this case is whether or not the appellant was an inhabitant of the City of St. John, N.B., in the year 1897, within the meaning of the Act of Assembly, 59 Vict. ch. 61, sec. 2. The section is as follows:\n(114.) For the purposes of assessment, any person having his home or domicile, or carrying on business, or having any office or place of business, or any occupation, employment or profession within the City of Saint John, shall be deemed and taken to be and is hereby declared to be an inhabitant and resident of th\u00e8 said city, any law io the contrary notwithstanding, and any person assessed as such inhabitant and resident shall be deemed and taken so to be, unless upon appeal to the Common Council, such person shall have been found to have been within the said city for a temporary purpose unconnected with business and shall have proved to the satisfaction of the Common Council that he possesses, or has acquired, a home or domicile at some other place designated by him, and that he has not during the year for which said assessment was made, had any office or place of business, or any occupation, employment or profession, within the City of Saint John, or carried on any business therein; provided that any person whose actual home or domicile is out of the city, shall not be assessed on a poll tax within the city; provided also that any person temporarily employed in the city as a labourer or journeyman mechanic, whose home or domicile is out of the city shall not be assessed as a resident.\nIn the year 1897, Mr. Jones having been assessed as an inhabitant in respect of personal property of the assessed value of $150,000, appealed to the Common Council, as provided by the Act, claiming that he was a resident of the City of New York, and not of St. John. The appeal was dismissed, and Mr. Jones then applied to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick for a certiorari to bring up the assessment against him with the view of quashing it. The present appeal is from a judgment dismissing such application.\nIt appears that Mr. Jones was born in York County, N.B., about the year 1829, and when twenty-two years of age moved to St. John, where he lived and carried on the business of a brewer for upwards of forty years. During the latter part of this period he had business transactions in New York, chiefly in the buying and selling of stocks, bonds and other securities on his own behalf, and in 1892 he contemplated retiring from his business in St. John and going to New York to live and engage more actively in the business he had been carrying on there.\nIn pursuance of this intention he leased the brewery to three of his sons, and in 1893 sold it to them. At this time Mr. Jones was a widower, his wife having died five years previously, and he so continues. His family then consisted of six sons and two daughters, all unmarried, and residing with him, or at school.\nIn 1893 he conveyed the house in which he resided and the furniture to those of his children who were of age, in trust for all the children. This was done in pursuance of an expressed intention to quit St. John as a place of residence and to live permanently, or for an indefinite time, in New York. He accordingly left St. John and went to New York, where he has lived, in the main, ever since, and where he has carried on his entire business. In New York he did not maintain a house, but lived in a single room in the Plaza Hotel, and paid for the room only when he occupied it. He was accustomed to spend the Christmas holidays with his children in St. John, and also was accustomed, in the summer season, to spend several months with them, usually leaving New York about the middle of June and returning about the middle of September. On the occasions of his return to St. John he lived with his unmarried children in the house already referred to. In 1897, the time spent in St. John amounted to thirteen or fourteen weeks. At this time two of his sons were married and lived in houses of their own, in St. John, and the elder daughter was married and lived in Scotland. The other children were living in the original family residence or were at school. From the testimony of Mr. Jones and his son Keltie, before the appeals committee of the Common Council, it appears that the St. John establishment was maintained partly by the members of the family residing in it who were carrying on business for themselves in St. John, and partly through gifts of money by Mr. Jones.\nWhen he left St. John in 1893, he was a director of the Bank of New Brunswick, a local institution, and continued such until his resignation in February, 1898. On his visits to St. John he regularly attended the board meetings, but the business of the board formed no part of his object in visiting the place. In 1897 the number of these attendances was thirty-one, the allowance for which was $4 for each meeting.\nHe has never been personally taxed in any way in New York, and has taken no part in its municipal affairs. In his examination before the committee of the Common Council, Mr. Jones was questioned by the Respondent as to his intentions, and he testified that since leaving in 1893, he always had the settled intention of not again returning to St. John to reside, and that his intention was to remain in New York indefinitely, although prior to 1898 (at which time he was giving his evidence) he had thought that he might yield to pressure from his daughter in Scotland and go there when he should close up his business, but that he had since abandoned the idea.\nIn Thorndike v. Boston[1], a case, like this, of municipal domicil for taxation purposes, Shaw C.J. says:\nThe questions of residence, inhabitancy or domicile,\u2014for although not in all respects precisely the same, they are nearly so and depend upon much the same evidence,\u2014are attended with more difficulty than almost any other which are presented for adjudication. No exact definition can be given of domicile; it depends upon no one fact of combination of circumstances; but, from the whole taken together, it must be determined in each particular case. It is a maxim, that every man must have a domicile somewhere; and also that he can have but one. Of course it follows that his existing domicile continues until he acquires another; and, vice versa, by acquiring a new domicile, he relinquishes his former one. From this view it is manifest that very slight circumstances must often decide the question.\nAnd in Lyman v. Fiske[2], the same learned judge says:\nIt is manifest that it (habitancy) embraces the fact of residence at a place, with the intent to regard it and make it his home. The act and intent must concur, and the intent may be inferred from declarations and conduct. It is often a question of great difficulty, depending upon minute and complicated circumstances leaving the question in so much doubt that a slight circumstance may turn the balance. In such a case, the mere declaration of the party made in good faith, of his election to make the one place rather than the other his home, would be sufficient to turn the scale.\nWhile the circumstance is not conclusive, it is held in Platt v. Attorney General of New South Wales[3] that: It is always material in determining what is a man's domicile to consider where his wife and children live and have their permanent place of residence, and where his establishment is kept up.\nAs to inferences from the mode of living, Lord Chelmsford in Moorehouse v. Lord[4] says:\nIn a question of change of domicile, the attention must not be too closely confined to the nature and character of the residence by which the new domicile is supposed to have been acquired.\nAnd in Guier v. O'Daniel[5] it is said:\nThe apparent or avowed intention of constant residence, not the manner of it, constitutes the domicile.\nIn Aikman v. Aikman[6], Lord Wensleydale says:\nI do not say that in order to obtain a domicile in a country, a man must necessarily have a house of his own and reside in it. Circumstances may be so strong as to shew a fixed purpose of abandoning his own country and making his home in another, and to shew also the accomplishment of that object, though he lives in inns or temporary lodgings, but such cases are rare.\nAnd in the same case Lord Cransworth says:\nI will not say in point of law that a person may not acquire a domicile by residence at a hotel; but it can rarely happen, as a matter of fact, that such residence is intended to be of a permanent character.\nIt is however to be borne in mind that in recent times a practice of living in hotels has become more common than formerly, especially upon this continent.\nIn Udny v. Udny[7], Lord Westbury says on the general subject:\nDomicile of choice is a conclusion or inference which the law draws from the fact of a man fixing voluntarily his sole or chief residence in a particular place with an intention of continuing to reside there for an unlimited time.\nThere must be therefore, as so frequently expressed, both the fact of residence, and the intention to so reside for an unlimited time. The fact and the intention must concur, and both, therefore, are relevant facts to be proved by appropriate evidence. In Thorndike v. Boston[8], already referred to, the plaintiff had gone from Boston to Scotland and the following direction was held to be correct:\nThat if the jury were satisfied that the plaintiff went abroad, not for the mere purpose of travelling, or for any particular object, intending to return when that was accomplished, but with the intention of remaining abroad for an indefinite length of time, or with the intention of not returning to Boston to live in the event of his return to the United States, then he ceased to be an inhabitant of Boston liable to taxation.\nThe circumstances chiefly militating against the acquisition of a domicile in New York by Mr. Jones, are two, his mode of living there, and the facts in connection with the maintenance of the family home in St. John. The materiality of these circumstances lies in their bearing upon the question of his intention to make a permanent, or indefinitely continuing, home in New York.\nAs to the first two things are to be taken into account, the continuance of the hotel life for a period covering five years, and the fact that Mr. Jones was a widower. And as to the second, the facts are to be regarded in the light of Mr. Jones's open and avowed purpose to divest himself of all proprietary interest in the house at St. John and its furnishings, and fall short of proving that he maintained the establishment.\nThe case presented upon the evidence is similar to that instanced by Chief Justice Shaw, of Massachusetts, in Lyman v. Fiske[9], where in a case of nicely balanced circumstances the mere declaration of the party, made in good faith, of his election to make the one place rather than the other his home, was considered to be sufficient to turn the scale. Here we have explicit and repeated declarations of Mr. Jones, before the making of the assessment in question, which can leave no reasonable doubt as to his intention to abandon St. John as a place of residence and to make his home in New York (irrespective of whether he succeeded in the eye of the law in accomplishing it). His entire good faith in making the declaration has not been, and can not well be, impugned. We have therefore the fact of a long continued actual residence in New York as his chief place of abode, coupled with an avowed and bon\u00e2 fide intention to make it his home permanently, or, at least, for an indefinite time, and his fixed determination not to return to St. John to reside. There was, consequently, the acquisition of a new home or domicile, and the abandonment of the former one within the meaning of the Act.\nAs to Mr. Jones's attendance at the meetings of the Board of Directors of the Bank of New Brunswick, in 1897, while temporarily sojourning in St. John, this seems to be relied on merely as a circumstance tending to shew that there had really been no change of domicile. As such it is without real significance.\nThe result is that the appeal is to be allowed, the order appealed from set aside and a rule to be entered in the court below granting the writ of certiorari.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L.

Archibald and George Handley, both since deceased, by Felix Calvert Ladbroke and John Wright, trustees of the said General Mining Association, Limited. That George Handley, upon the execution of said deed took possession of said lands and has continued in undisputed and exclusive possession of said lands thence until the time of his death, and from the date of his death until the commencement of this action the defendants herein, or some of them, as the heirs of said George Handley, continued in such undisputed and exclusive possession and plaintiff's claim to said lands and premises, or to the moiety or any part thereof, if he has any, which defendants do not admit is barred by the Statute of Limitations, chapter 112 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, fifth series, intituled 'Of the Limitation of Actions.'\"\nThe action was tried out on this defence which was established in the opinion of Mr. Justice Henry, the trial judge, and judgment entered for the defendants thereon. This judgment was reversed by the full court and an order made for partition of the lands.\nThe evidence given on the issue above stated is fully set out in the judgment of His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nHarrington Q.C. for the appellant. Neither the respondent nor any one through whom he claims, has ever been in possession, either actively or constructively, of any part of this property.\nThe distinction drawm by Mr. Justice Gwynne in McConaghy v. Denmark[2] at page 632, has been disregarded by the majority of the court below, and the two cases mentioned have been confounded. They required the defendant to make out the same case against the plaintiff, as if he himself were bringing ejectment against the tenants whom he put in possession.\nThe Statute of Limitations[3] began to run as against respondent in 1861, when Charles D. Archibald was last in Nova Scotia. It has retroactive operation, and makes the possession of tenants in common a separate possession from the time they first became tenants in common, and not merely from 1886, the time of the passing of the statute. See pulley v. Doe d. Taylerson[4]; Doe d. Holt v. Horrocks[5]; O'Sullivan v. McSwiney[6].\nThe recovery in ejectment, in 1868, by George Handley and Charles Archibald, is irrelevant. John R. Handley, one of the present defendants, was a part owner along with his father, George Handley, of the land in dispute, but he was not a party to the ejectment suit and consequently it could not affect his rights The lands cannot be identified from the descriptions given, and a recovery in ejectment (even if of the very land in dispute) is not equivalent to possession in Archibald. It is merely a declaration that the plaintiffs are entitled to the possession and enabled them to enforce such right by taking possession.\nAs to estoppel, the parties here are not the same as in the Exchequer Court, nor is the present action brought with respect to the same subject matter; Taylor on Evidence, sec. 1695; and the point decided in the Exchequer Court has nothing to do with the issue in the present action. No question of title was raised there, but the point decided was as to shares in a sum of money paid into court as compensation for land expropriated. See Smith v. Royston[7]; Hunter v. Birney[8]; Outram v. Morewood[9]. In the Exchequer Court action the present defendants did not appear. Howlett v. Tarte[10]. A judgment by default cannot work an estoppel. Attorney-General v. Eriche[11]; per Lord Hobhouse at page 523. See also The Duchess of Kingston's Case,[12] where it is laid down that in order to establish the plea of res judicata, the court, whose judgment is invoked, must have had jurisdiction and have given judgment directly upon the matter in question, but that if the matter came collaterally into question in the first court, or were only incidentally cognizable by it, or merely to be inferred, the judgment is not conclusive.\nNewcombe Q.C., (Kenney with him), for the respondent. The plaintiff shows a good paper title to the interest of C. 13. Archibald as tenant in common of the lands in question. The burden is on the defendants to establish that the Statute of Limitations is a bar to this title. They defend as to the whole of the land. If they intend to claim part only they should have limited their defence in the manner prescribed by the rules.\nJohn R. Handley had no possession upon which to found the defence of the Statute of Limitations He was only two or three times at the place in all these years, and never lived there. He never received any rents or profits for the use of the land from any person. The possession by the tenant Matheson enured to the benefit of George T. Handley's heirs, not to the benefit of John R. Handley.\nThe proceedings in ejectment, in 1866, and judgment in 1868 in favour of C. D. Archibald and George Handley, for the recovery of the lands for which partition is sought herein, constitute an acknowledgement of C. D. Archibald's title. The declaration was an admission of the joint title of the plaintiffs, and the solicitor who signed it was the agent of both, to make it and to receive it; Goode v. Job[13]. But even an unsigned acknowledgement may interrupt the operation of the statute; Phillipson v. Gibbon[14]; and Handley could not have joined Archibald as plaintiff without his consent. See also Dixon v. Gayfere[15].\nThe ejectment proceedings are proof of a resumption of possession, and that there was, at that time, no dispossession of C. D. Archibald or discontinuance of possession by him. Handley could not say that he was in possession for his own benefit after joining Archibald as plaintiff. See also McKeen v. McKay[16].\nChap. 12, Nova Scotia Statutes, 1866, assimilates the law to that of England with regard to limitations of real actions, and sec. 9 makes the possession of tenants in common separate. Therefore, unless George Handley had a title to the common lands in 1866 by adverse possession, it was still open to C. D. Archibald to bring his action any time before 1871. No such title had been acquired in 1866; Handley had not been in possession; and, moreover, C. D. Archibald was under the disability of absence from the province down to 1861. C. D. Archibald's right of action therefore accrued in 1871. He was then under the same disability of absence from the province, which continued until his death between 1871 and 1875, when the right of action passed to his heirs, who would have ten years from his death within which to bring* their action. R. S. N. S. (5 ser.) ch. 113, sec. 10. But the heirs were under the same disability, themselves, at this time as sec. 18 of the Imperial Act is omitted from the Nova Scotia Act, as well as sec. 34 of that Act, barring the title of the person out of possession after the expiration of the statutory period. The disability of the heirs, tacked to the disability of the deceased, brings us down to the spring of 1877, and this action was begun in 1896, within the period of twenty years after the disability had ceased and their right of action first accrued.\nReceipt of half of the award for the land expropriated by Archibald prevented the bar of the statute, and the decree of the Exchequer Court is a judgment in rem and also estops the defendants from setting up the Statute of Limitations as a defence to this action.\nThis is not an action for the recovery, but for the division of land, and therefore the Statute of Limitations does not apply.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal entirely fails. The Statute of Limitations is sufficiently pleaded by the second paragraph of the statement of defence. This mode of pleading is considered sufficient to entitle a defendant to set up the Statute of Limitations in an action for the recovery of real property in England[17]; and I see no reason why it should not also suffice in Nova Scotia. Moreover, no objection as to the sufficiency of the pleading appears to have been raised either at the trial or on appeal to the Supreme Court, in banc, and under these circumstances I would not in any case at this stage give effect to such a point.\nI assume in the appellant's favour, without meaning to decide it, that the Statute of Limitations is a good defence to an action for partition.\nThe question of the disabilities of Charles Dickson Archibald and his co-heirs need not in the view I take be considered, and we are therefore relieved from pronouncing any opinion on the important question alluded to in the argument regarding the effect of the Nova Scotia Statute of Limitations (R. S. N. S. 5 Ser. ch. 112), in the case of a succession of disabilities, the 19th section of that Act providing for the case of disabilities not being accompanied by any such provision as that contained in the 18th section of the English statute 3 & 4 Wm. 4 ch. 27, enacting that there shall be no succession of disabilities.\nNor is it requisite to adjudicate upon the effect of the omission from the statute governing this case, of any re-enactment of the 34th section of the English Act by which it is declared that at the end of the period of limitation the right of the party out of possession shall be extinguished.\nFurther upon the English and Irish authorities we may take it as established law that the 17th section of the statute has a retrospective application, that is to say, that it applies to non-adverse possession by one tenant in common to the exclusion of the co-tenants before the passing of the Act.\nI merely refer to all these points which underwent more or less discussion at the argument to shew that they have not been overlooked but are considered irrelevant in the view now taken of the case.\nThis action was commenced in August, 1896. In 1868 there was a judgment in an action brought for the recovery of the land in question by Charles Dickson Archibald and George Handley against one Morrison whose defence was limited to a certain part of the lands. The entry of the judgment, however, appears to be general, but whether it is so or not makes no difference. It is clear that if Charles Dickson Archibald had at the date this judgment was signed on the 3rd July, 1868, actually entered into possession of any part of these lands, no one else being then in actual possession of the residue, his entry and possession would be referred to his then existing title as a tenant in common with George Handley. The recovery in ejectment therefore conferred a right of entry, and the time from which to compute the running of the statute is therefore subject to what is said hereafter to be taken to be July, 1868. Whatever doubts there may have been having regard to the language of the Act, when the statute 3 & 4 Wm. 4 was first passed, it is now elementary law that the statute does not run against a party out of possession unless there is a person in possession; Smith v. Lloyd[18]; McDonnell v. McKinty[19]; and further, if there has been a series of persons in possession for the statutory term between some of whom and their predecessors there has been no privity in such case the bar of the statute is complete, but if there has been any interval between the possession of such persons then inasmuch as during that interval the law refers the possession to the real owner having title, the benefit of the former possession of a precedent wrongdoer is lost to a trespasser who subsequently enters, in whose favour the statute consequently runs only from the date of his own entry. The Trustees Agency Co. v. Short[20]. And this rule is not affected by the old common law principle that in case of disseisin there could be no remitter without actual entry inasmuch as the statute does not deal with feudal possession or seisin but with actual or constructive statutory possession as distinguished from seisin.\nThen what we are called upon to do here is to apply the statute to the undisputed facts as they appear in the record before us. In doing this it may be premised that the onus of proving that the possession has been such as to entitle them to the bar of the statute, is upon the appellants who have pleaded the defence.\nThere can be no question upon the concessions and admissions of the parties that George Handley senior, and Charles Dickson Archibald, were originally tenants in common of the land in question, and whatever their rights as between themselves and as affected by the statute of limitations might have been before 1868, as to which it is not material to inquire, Charles Dickson Archibald must be considered as having acquired a new right of entry on the 3rd of July, 1868, from which time at the earliest the statute could have begun to run against him. It is therefore incumbent upon the appellants to make out that for twenty years subsequently to that date Charles Dickson Archibald (who is said to have died in 1875) and his heirs at law were continuously out of possession, whilst the defendants who plead the statute either by themselves or those claiming under them, or those whose possession they were entitled to join to their own, were in continuous possession. Then what are the facts relating to this possession which we find in evidence? In 1868 George Handley, the younger, was in possession, and he died in that year, upon which his father, George Handley, senior, the co-owner with George Dickson Archibald, of the property, is said to have taken possession. In 1870, George Handley, the father, died intestate, leaving as his co-heirs at law his sons John E. Handley and William Handley, and the children of his two daughters Mary Van Buskirk and Theresa Jane Hay. The appellant, John E. Handley, does not pretend ever to have been in actual occupation of the property himself; the most that he can claim is that he was after his father's death in constructive possession by his tenant, one Matheson, who left in 1881, after, as John E. Handley says, having been in possession for ten years. In giving this evidence dates are loosely referred to, and there is no pretence of stating with accuracy the exact date of the lease for three years to Matheson, and the exact date at which the latter gave up his overholden possession. The party who relies solely on his own testimony to establish his case cannot complain if he is held strictly to what he says in reference to the dates. He says:\nMy father who died in 1870, occupied after George's death.\nThen he adds:\nAfter my father's death I gave Matheson a lease of the place for three years. My mother and sister were aware that I had taken control of the property. I continued to look after the place up to the present time. Matheson remained there about ten years paying rent; $100 expended on the property. When Matheson left in April, 1881, he gave the keys under my instructions to my brother William who has since till now lived in the house. I don't know that Matheson gave the keys to my brother William\u2014William pays no rent\u2014I just allow him to occupy.\nThis being the testimony of the appellant himself we must assume he states the facts in his own favour as strongly as the truth justifies.\nThen on his own shewing there has been no such possession as is required to warrant the bar of the statute in his favour. First, there must have been an interval between the death of George, the father, in 1870, and the entry of Matheson as a tenant under the appellant John R. Handley, for Matheson after a holding of ten years gave up possession in 1881; his occupation must have commenced in 1871, and there was therefore a gap or interval between the father's death and Matheson's possession of one year or thereabouts during which no one was in possession, and whereupon the possession would have been attributed by the law to the parties having title, namely the co-heirs of Charles Dickson Archibald and the co-heirs of John R. Handley. Then the new date for the running of the statute would have been fixed on Matheson's entry in 1871. Is it then shewn that the appellant had twenty years possession from that date, the spring of 1871? The answer must be certainly in the negative. William Handley who was one of the co-heirs of his father and who is a defendant in the present action, is said by the appellant to have been in possession from the date of Matheson's departure until action brought; he had of course an interest in the land as one of the co-heirs of his father; his possession did not under the present law enure to the benefit of his co-heirs, and upon the evidence it is impossible to attribute it to any holding or tenancy under the appellant John R. Handley. The latter says first that the keys were given up by Matheson to William, afterwards he says he does not know whether Matheson did give William the keys or not. There is therefore nothing in this shewing privity between William and the appellant John R. Handley. Then he says William paid no rent, \"I just allow him to occupy.\" This does not prove that William is a tenant under John R. Handley. We must therefore attribute William's possession to his own title as one of the co-heirs, and this being so there has been no possession which would entitle either the appellant John R. Handley or the VanBuskirks who alone have pleaded the statute to the benefit of that defence. The defendant William Handley has not set up the statute nor relied on it as a defence.\nI forbear from saying anything about the evidence as to the area of possession inasmuch as in the view I take it is not necessary to refer to it.\nI think the Exchequer proceedings have no bearing on the case. The money which represented the land taken by the Crown by way of expropriation, was not received until after this action was brought, and if a title had then accrued under the statute, a subsequent entry or receipt of profits (and the receipt of the money could have no greater effect than this) would not revive the statute-barred title if one there had been.\nThe appellants are entitled to an account of and allowance for the improvements made by them or any of them, but if they insist on such an account they must also themselves account for the rents and profits received by them or for an occupation rent and that at the improved value. The case for an account of the improvements is made by the added defence, and it is also claimed in the appellant's factum. The law on this head appears clear. An action cannot be maintained by one tenant in common against another for the value of improvements alone. But in a partition action in equity such an allowance was always made. Pascoe v. Swan[21]; Gibbons v. Snape[22]; Crowther v. Crowther[23]; Teasdale v. Sanderson[24]; Griffies v. Griffies[25].\nThe judgment must be varied accordingly if the parties elect to take the account. This however cannot be permitted to affect the costs. The whole contention has been upon the Statute of Limitations and upon that the appellants fail and must pay the costs. Therefore subject to the variation indicated (if insisted on) the appeal is dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an action instituted under the provisions of ch. 122 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 5th series, for partition of an estate called the St. Peter's estate, situate in Cape Breton, whereof one Charles D. Archibald and one George Handley, in their lifetime, now deceased, were seized in fee, in equal moities as tenants in common, the plaintiff claiming that the moiety whereof Charles D. Archibald in his lifetime was seized is now vested in the plaintiff, and that the moiety whereof the said George Handley was seized is vested in the defendants as his heirs at law. By the said ch. 122 it is enacted that a petition for partition shall be filed in the same manner as a declaration in ordinary cases, and that the defendants may plead thereto either separately or jointly\nany matter tending to show that the petitioner ought not to have partition either in whole or in part and the replication and further proceedings shall be conducted as in other actions until issue is joined which shall be tried as in other actions.\nAnd it is thereby further enacted that if a defendant shall make default in appearing and answering the petition\na rule that partition shall be made shall pass, but the court shall have the same right of setting aside defaults and of granting new trials as in other cases.\nNow to the petition in this case all the defendants except John E. Handley and George E. VanBuskirk have suffered judgment to be entered against them for default, and the said John R. Handley who is one of the children and one of the heirs at law of the said George Handley and George E. VanBuskirk who is a son of a deceased sister of the said John R. Handley have joined in pleading the defence following:\nThese defendants say that by deed dated the 4th day of December, 1839, and recorded in the Registry of Deeds for the County of Richmond, the said lands and premises were conveyed to said Charles D. Archibald and George Handley, both since deceased, by Felix Culvert Sudbroke and John Wright, trustees of the said General Mining Association, Limited; that George Handley upon the execution of the said deed took possession of said lands and has continued in undisputed and exclusive possession of said lands thence until the time of his death, and from the date of his death until the commencement of this action the defendants herein or some of them as the heirs of the said George Handley continued in such undisputed and exclusive possession. and they conclude this plea by insisting that by reason of the matters alleged therein the plaintiff's claim to the said lands and to the moiety or any part thereof is barred by the Statute of Limitations. The plaintiff joined issue upon the above plea and put the defendants pleading that defence upon the proof of the matters as therein pleaded, and the question is: Have they succeeded in establishing the truth of the plea? the only evidence in support of which was given by John R. Handley himself upon two occasions.\n1st. In 1894 upon an information which had been filed in the Exchequer Court by the Dominion Government against the now plaintiff and defendants and others, such others being persons who claimed title adversely to the now plaintiff and defendants, for the purpose of determining the right and title of the Dominion Government to a piece of the said lands whereof the said Charles D. Archibald and George Handley in their lifetime were seized in fee as tenants in common and which had been in December, 1875, entered upon and taken by the Dominion Government for the enlargement of the St. Peter's Canal in Cape Breton and for the purpose also of determining what amount should be paid by the Government for the piece of land so taken, and to whom and in what proportions the same should be paid the evidence given upon inquiries made by order of the Exchequer Court in the matter of the said information having by consent of the parties been taken and read as evidence in the present suit; and secondly, upon the oral examination of the said John R. Handley upon the issue joined between him and the plaintiff in the present suit.\nIn his evidence in the proceedings in the Exchequer Court taken in 1894 he stated that his brother George in 1840 settled where the land which was taken by the Government in 1875 for canal purposes was situate; that he carried on there a country store and shipbuilding business continuously from 1840 until some time in 1868 when he went to the West Indies where he died in that year; that he had a dwelling house, barn and store and a field of about four acres enclosed round the store and house which he occupied in addition to the 2\u00bd acres which was taken for the enlargement of the canal in 1875. He also said that another brother (the defendant to this suit, named William) had in George T. Handley's lifetime a store on the piece taken by the Government in 1875, and that after the death of his brother George T. he continued in occupation thereof until the piece was taken by the Government in 1875, and that William also in 1872 or or 1873 erected another store on a site where his brother George T. Handley in his lifetime had a store which had been burned down. He further said that on the death of his brother George T., one Matheson who had been his brother George's clerk and who had been left in possession by George when he went to the West Indies continued in occupation of the premises which had been occupied by George in his lifetime; that he, John R. Handley was his brother George's administrator, and that Matheson occupied under him from 1868 to 1878; and he said finally that his father died in 1870 intestate.\nIn his evidence upon the trial of the issue in the present case he gave evidence to the like effect with the following differences however. He said that\nhis father who died in 1870 occupied the property after George's death.\nThe only evidence which he gave of the fact or of the nature of such occupation was that he said\nhis father lived in Halifax and went down nearly every summer.\nHe said further that after his father's death he gave Matheson a lease of the place for three years\u2014but that Matheson remained there for ten years\u2014that\nhe made his first agreement with Matheson intending to act as George's administrator which he was.\nHe said further that Matheson left in 1881 and that when he left he, John R. Handley, told him to give the keys to William Handley.\nHere it may be observed that in his evidence in the proceedings upon the information in the Exchequer Court there is no mention made of their having been more than one agreement between John R. Handley and Matheson for the occupation of any part of the premises by the latter, nor of there having been any agreement or lease for three years, but John R. Handley then stated that after the death of his brother George, his clerk Matheson occupied the premises which George in his lifetime had occupied until 1878 under lease from him, John R. Handley, who was his brother George's administrator. Then as to his having directed Matheson to give the keys to William when leaving, that is wholly irrelevant for there is no evidence that they were so delivered. The only evidence of William having ever had possession of any part of the premises in question is that of the defendant VanBruskirk who said that he\nsaw William in possession of the house and property the winter before last,\nthat was the winter of 1896 and 1897, and the house and property alluded to, plainly to the house and property which George T. Handley had occupied in his lifetime, but there is no evidence whatever as to the time when William did enter upon such possession nor how long he continued therein. It may be true that William did at sometime or other enter into possession of some part of the premises in question which might have matured into a title in himself in fee in the part so possessed by him by virtue of the Statute of Limitations, but there is no evidence upon such a point even if it were admissible under the issue joined, and we have evidence upon the record that William has suffered interlocutory judgment to go against him by default in the present suit. John R Handley in his evidence given at the trial of this case also said that one R. G. Morrison, (but when he did not say,) disputed one of the boundary lines of the premises in question and erected a building thereon and was ejected under a suit brought by Archibald and Handley. The record in that suit has been produced in evidence and thereby it appears that on the 23rd day of August, 1866, Charles D. Archibald and George Handley as plaintiffs in an action of ejectment theretofore brought by them in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia recovered a judgment against Roderick G. Morrison, the defendant in the said action for his withholding from the said plaintiffs therein the possession of the lands covered by a description specially set out in the declaration filed in the said action which description included within its bounds the whole of the lands aforesaid whereof the said Charles D. Archibald and George Handley were seized in fee as tenants in common and to recover possession of which from the said Roderick G. Morrison they brought their action.\nThe Nova Scotia Statute of Limitations which adopted the provisions of the Imperial Statute, 3 & 4 Wm. IV, ch. 27, was passed in 1866 and is now ch. 112 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 5th series; and the 17th section of that Act is taken verbatim from the 12th section of 3 & 4 Wm. IV, ch. 27. Now by that Act to enable one tenant in common to divest his co-tenant in common of the latter's share of the estate held in common, he must be in actual possession or receipt of the entirety or more than his own undivided share of the lands held in common, or of the profits or rent issuing therefrom either for his own benefit or for the benefit of some other person than his co-tenant in common. Thus if A. and B. be seized of an estate in fee as tenants in common in equal moieties, and A. enters upon and takes possession of a part or the rents and profits issuing therefrom, B.'s right to his undivided moiety in the residue remains undisturbed. Murphy v. Murphy[26].\nNow there is not a particle of evidence that either the co-tenant, George Handley, in his life time, or any person as his heir at law or as one of such Heirs or otherwise was since his death in possession of any part of the lands held by the common title, outside of the 6\u00bd acres of which George T. Handley died possessed in 1868. No rents or profits of any kind whatever appear to have ever issued out of such lands outside of the said 6\u00bd acres, and as to them the evidence is that George T. Handley was the person in possession of them from his entry in 1840 until his death in 1868, it may have been with his father's consent, but in the absence of any written title from his father, and drawing the proper inference from the facts stated in evidence, plainly for his own use and benefit and sufficient to make his possession such a one as would in progress of time mature into a title in him in fee by virtue of the Statute of Limitations. There is no evidence whatever that George's possession was merely that of the father who never appears to have interfered in the premises, or to have gone near them from Halifax, where he lived, more than \"nearly every summer\" and then probably to pay a visit to his son George, who was living there and carrying on the business there of a country store, and shipbuilding for his own benefit. The evidence certainly shows nothing to the contrary. John R. Handley's interference with these 6\u00bd acres upon his brother George's death in 1868, (to draw a proper inference from his own evidence), is, I think to be attributed to his assuming to act as his brother George's representative, in which character also Matheson's possession of what George T., in his lifetime had occupied, less the 2\u00bd acres taken for the canal in 1875, under John E. Handley until 1878, must I think be regarded.\nThis is the view which I take of the evidence apart from consideration of the action of ejectment brought against Morrison wherein judgment was recovered against him in August, 1866. That judgment however is, in my opinion, conclusive that the plea of John R. Handley and George E. VanBuskirk cannot be maintained for the foundation upon which the superstructure of a title by the Statute of Limitations is erected falling, the whole superstructure evidently falls to the ground. Upon the pleadings in that action it appears upon record that Charles D. Archibald and George Handley declared against Roderick G. Morrison as a person charged by them to be in possession of the whole of the lands in question in the present suit, and with withholding such possession from them, and that they claimed to be entitled to recover such possession and evict Morrison, therefrom, and did by the judgment of the court recover judgment to that effect. The significance of that judgment in the present case is this that the heirs at law of George Handley cannot be permitted now to allege and contend that the admission on record made by both of the tenants in common joining in the said action that Roderick G. Morrison was in possession of the whole of the premises in question, and was withholding possession from the plaintiffs who claimed title thereto, and the judgment in the said action for the recovery of possession by the plaintiffs and the eviction of Morrison therefrom were altogether erroneous, and that in point of fact George Handley, one of the said plaintiffs, was himself then in actual possession of the whole of the said lands and premises for his own benefit to the complete exclusion of the co-tenant in common, and was then acquiring in himself an absolute title in fee simple in the premises in absolute defeasance of the title of his co-tenant.\nThere is no evidence whatever of an entry upon, or possession taken of, any part of the premises in question by George Handley, or indeed by any person whomsoever since the recovery of the judgment for the eviction of Morrison in August, 1866, upon which any title, as acquired by the statute, could be pleaded. Now the plea which has been pleaded, and which if not proved must wholly fail, is one of an absolute indefeasible estate in fee simple in the moiety admitted to have been formerly vested in Charles D. Archibald, but now alleged to be vested in the heirs at law of George Handley, deceased, of whom the defendant John R. Handley is one, in virtue of the Statute of Limitations having operated as is alleged upon an actual, undisputed, possession of the whole of the estate held in common, taken as is alleged by the co-tenant in common, George Handley, in 1839, and the constant continuance of that possession by the said George Handley until his death, which occurred in 1870, and the continuance of such possession in his heirs upon and ever since his death, until the commencement of this suit. That the defendants have failed to establish the truth of this plea must in my opinion be held upon the same principle that the defendants in McConaghy v. Denmark[27] failed to establish their plea of Liberum tenementum. In that case to an action of trespass quare clausumfregit the defendants pleaded liberum tenementum in themselves by title derived from M. & L. McConaghy. Having failed to prove a paper title they insisted upon what they contended shewed continual visible possession by themselves and those with whom they claimed to be in privity for a period exceeding twenty years, but it was held that they could not succeed because the evidence failed to show a continuance of possession by persons holding in privity with each other for the necessary period, namely, for such a period as would entitle a plaintiff to recover in an action of ejectment under the provisions of the Statute of Limitations. There the difference is pointed out between the title of a person defending his possession in an action of ejectment and of a person bringing an action of ejectment to recover possession of land the title to which was acquired only by force of the Statute of Limitations. Now in a special plea of title as in the present case where the pleading defendants have assumed the burthen of proving title as pleaded, if they fail in any particular they must fail altogether, for the plaintiff has proved priority of estate with Charles D. Archibald, whose title is admitted on the record unless it has been extinguished and transferred to his co-tenant in common and his heirs in severalty by the title as pleaded. The pleading defendants have in my opinion for the reasons given wholly failed to establish their plea, and the appeal therefore in my opinion must be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK, KING and GIROUARD JJ. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: C.

The appeal involves only a question of law which is indicated in the above note of the decision.\nS.H. Blake Q.C. and Irving for the appellant. If the mortgagee had power to surrender the mortgage without the lessor\u2019s consent it could only be for the bon\u00e2 fide purpose of carrying out its object and not to get rid of liability.\nThere could be no further dealing with the lease without the lessor\u2019s consent though there might be with the residue of the term. See Treloar v. Bigge[2]; Williams v. Bosanquet[3]; Eaton v. Jacques[4]. In re Gee[5]. Robinson Q.C. and Johnston for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The appellant by indenture bearing date the first day of January, 1889, demised the property in question (land and buildings situate in the City of Toronto) to one James Rogers Armstrong, since deceased, for a term of twenty-one years at an annual rental of $1,400. The lease contained a covenant on the part of the lessee that he would not assign the term without the consent in writing of the lessor \u201cfirst had and received.\u201d\nArmstrong, the lessee, borrowed money ($4,000), from the respondents to secure which he gave them a mortgage by way of assignment of the residue of the term in the leasehold premises in question. This mortgage bearing date the 22nd of March, 1889, was by indenture and contained the usual proviso for its defeasance, on payment of the mortgage money and interest at the times specified. The consent of the appellant was indorsed on the mortgage and was in the following words:\nI Philip Jamieson, the lessor named in the within mortgage do hereby consent to the within mortgage by way of assignment by James Rogers Armstrong to the London and Canadian Loan and Agency Company, Limited.\nThis memorandum was signed and sealed by the appellant.\nSubsequently on the 27th of February, 1891, Armstrong made another mortgage to the respondents in the same terms as the first to secure another loan of $1,600, and a written consent signed and sealed by the appellant in the same terms as the first was also indorsed on this latter instrument.\nThe respondents having been adjudged liable as assignees of the lease in the covenants contained in the lease for the payment of rent and taxes, and Armstrong having died insolvent, were desirous of escaping from the liability imposed upon them by the assignment, and for that purpose were prepared to release their debt and abandon the security, and with that view were about to register the usual statutory discharge in the form prescribed by the Registry Act when the appellant instituted this action claiming a declaration that the respondents could not effectually create such a discharge without the consent of the appellant, and also an injunction restraining them from doing so.\nThe respondents did not dispute any of the facts alleged by the appellant but in their defence claimed to have the legal right to release the debt and reconvey or revest the estate.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Falconbridge who decided for the appellant. This judgment was however reversed by a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal from which the present appeal has been brought.\nNo authority in point has been produced, and I have been unable to find any. After some hesitation I have come to the conclusion that the judgment under appeal was right, for the reasons assigned in the judgment of the Chief Justice and of those of Mr. Justice Maclennan and Mr. Justice Moss.\nA mortgage was formerly viewed very differently in a court of common law and in a court of equity. The first regarded it as a conveyance of an estate defeasible on the due performance of the condition by payment at the day specified; a court of equity on the other hand considered it to be a mere security for the debt upon payment of which the estate was redeemable at any time before foreclosure though forfeited at law by reason of non-payment according to the tenor of the proviso. Further, the latter courts considered the estate mortgaged as a mere accessory which upon the payment or release of the debt the mortgagee was bound to reconvey to the mortgagor.\nUnder the present system of judicature all courts are bound to deal with a mortgage as courts of equity always have dealt with it, as a mere accessory to the debt. So far has this been carried that it has been held that a mere parol assignment of the debt, no mention being made of the mortgage, entitles the assignee to the benefit of the mortgage though that might be a security on lands.\nIt is to be observed here that the consent of the appellant authorising the assignment of the term indorsed upon the mortgage is not in general terms but refers to the specific mortgage upon which it is indorsed, and must therefore be considered as an assent not only to the expressed covenants and provisions contained in the instrument itself but also to all such incidents as the law attaches to the covenants and agreements between the parties set forth in the deed itself. Now it cannot be denied that one of these was that on the payment of the debt, whether ad diem or post diem, the mortgagee would be bound to reconvey the leaseholds held in security to the mortgagor or as he might appoint. The appellant must therefore be taken to have assented to this. Further just as the estate would have revested by the operation of the condition itself declaring the deed defeasible upon payment at the day, so likewise the mortgage would have been avoided if before the day the mortgagee had released the debt to the mortgagor, or at least a court of equity would in that event have enforced a reconveyance. So in equity, though not in law, would such release after the day fixed for payment have given the mortgagor the right to call for a re-assignment of the mortgaged lands Such were beyond all doubt the rights as between mortgagor and mortgagee at all times in courts of equity, and since the Judicature Act in all courts having jurisdiction of the subject matter. These then being the rights between the parties, and the appellant having no right to prescribe to them what their dealings should be respecting the debt as to which they could not be in any way fettered, the respondents were free if they chose to do so to release the debt upon which the mortgagor would have a right to call for a reconveyance. This being so, could it be said that the mortgagee could not reconvey without a new license from the appellant? I think not. It appears rather that the proper construction to put upon the memorandum indorsed upon the deed and signed by the appellant is this; he must be taken to say, I assent to the mortgage being made and to such further dealings with the estate as the law imposes as a consequence of the extinguishment of the mortgage debt. This if correct in point of reasoning must be conclusive.\nAs to authority the cases which determine that an equitable mortgagee of leaseholds by deposit will not be compelled to take a legal assignment in order to make him liable upon the covenants have little to do with this case. The dictum of Dallas C.J. in Williams v. Bosanquet[6], so far as it goes is favourable to the respondents. The old cases in Vernon appears to me to be beside the point. The omission in the later editions of Woodfall of the passage supposed to bear upon this question is significant of a change of opinion in the editor which to some extent helps the respondents, but all these authorities bear upon the question of the liability of the mortgagee on the covenants and his right to relief therefrom, and not upon the construction to be given to the lessor\u2019s license to assign and the extent to which that license is to be carried which is the point before us on this appeal. I quite admit that equity had no jurisdiction to control the legal right of the lessor to hold a mortgagee bound by covenants running with the land in a lease of which he had taken an assignment. But that is not the point here. What we have to do is to consider and determine not whether acquired legal rights can be controlled or interfered with in equity, but what are the legal and equitable rights of a lessor who has given such a license to assign as that which the appellant signed in the present instance. As to that there can, in my opinion, be only one answer, that given by the Court of Appeal.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Kilmer & Irving.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Arnoldi & Johnston.\n[1] 26 Ont.

C.\nA contract for the construction and maintenance of a system of waterworks required them to be completed in a manner satisfactory to the corporation and allowed the contractors thirty days after notice to put the works in satisfactory working order. On the expiration of the time for the completion of the works the corporation served a protest upon the contractors complaining in general terms of the insufficiency and unsatisfactory construction of the works without specifying particular defects, but made use of the works complained of for about nine years when, without further notice action was brought for the rescission of the contrari and forfeiture of the works under conditions in the contract\nHeld, that, after the long delay, when the contractors could not be replaced in the original position, the complaint must be deemed to have been waived by acceptance and use of the waterworks and it would under the circumstances, be inequitable to rescind the contract.\nHeld further that a notice specifying the particular defects to be remedied was a condition precedent to action and that the protest in general terms was not a sufficient compliance therewith to place the contractors in default. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Court of Review, at Montreal, which reversed the decision of the Superior Court District of Saint Francis, in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe action was brought in 1892 for the annulment of a contract made in 1881 between the parties in relation to the construction of a system of waterworks in the Town of Richmond and prayed for the forfeiture of the works in default of their removal within ninety days and for $5,000 damages.\nThe circumstances under which the action was taken were as follows : In 1881 a contract was entered into between the plaintiff and the defendants by which the latter undertook to construct a system of waterworks and to furnish the Town of Richmond with a supply of water on certain conditions during a terms of years This contract did not define any particular method of construction and there were no plans or specifications, but it was provided that the system of waterworks should be constructed within a specified time to the satisfaction of the appellant, and that, on default of the contractors to remedy defects within thirty days after notice, there should be a forfeiture of the works to the corporation or, at the option of the corporation, that the contractors might, on repayment of whatever money they might have received from the corporation, remove the works.\nOn the expiration of the time limited for the completion of the works in July, 1883, the works being still incomplete, the appellant served a written protest upon the contractors complaining of the imperfect, incomplete and unsatisfactory condition of the works in a general way and without specifying wherein any of the defects might consist but, notwithstanding the protest, the appellants made use of the works for about nine years before commencing the action. The plaintiff complained in the action that the \"works had not been constructed in conformity with the contract and had not been completed in a satisfactory manner, that there was not a sufficient supply of good water provided, that the pressure was insufficient and that the contractors had failed to remedy the defects within the thirty days allowed by the contract after the signification of the protest. No special notice was given before the institution of the action.\nBy the judgment of the trial court the contract was reselected and the works ordered to be removed. On appeal to the Court of Review the trial court \"judgment was reversed and the present appeal has been taken from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench affirming the judgment of the Court of Review.\nH.

It would not be just and equitable now to rescind this contract after some fifteen years enjoyment by the appellant of the respondents' works and when the respondents can no longer be put in their original position. The respondents ought to have been put en demeure. It is impossible now after the long delay which has occurred since the protest of the 10th July 1883, to give any effect to that act.

The latter received an assignment of the Canadian patent and paid a portion of the purchase, but when the American patent was issued it was found to contain a variation from the description of the machine in the caveat and they refused to pay the balance, and in an action by M. to recover the same, they demanded by counterclaim a return of what had been paid on account.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that the agreement was not satisfied by an assignment of any patent that M. might afterwards obtain; that he was bound to obtain and assign a patent for the machine described in the caveat referred to in the agreement; and that as the evidence showed the variation therefrom in the American patent to be most material, and to deprive the purchasers of a feature in the machine which they deemed essential, M. was not entitled to recover.\nHeld further, Gwynne J. dissenting, that as B. and S. accepted the Canadian patent and paid a portion of the purchase money in consideration thereof, and as they took the benefit of it, worked it for their own profit and sold rights under it, they were not entitled to recover back the money so paid as money had and received by M. to their use. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts are sufficiently indicated in the above note and fully stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nNesbitt Q.C. and Biggar for the appellants. The contract could only be satisfied by giving defendant a patent of the very article specified; even if something better is given it will not be sufficient. Leigh v.

Canniff[4].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne so far as relates to the principal action as to which the appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nAs regards the counter claim by which the appellants seek to recover the $750 paid when the Canadian patent was assigned to them, I am of opinion that the amount so paid cannot be treated as money had and received by the respondent to the use of the appellants, inasmuch as the appellants accepted the patent and must be considered to have waived all objections to it, as they have taken the benefit of it, have worked it for their own profit, and have sold rights under it. The counterclaim was therefore properly dismissed and the judgment appealed against must stand to that extent. In other respects the appeal must be allowed with costs. TASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs, and the action dismissed with costs. On the counter-claim, I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an appeal by the defendants from a judgment recovered against them by the plaintiff upon an agreement stated in his statement of claim, in virtue of which and of the alleged fulfilment by him of all the conditions which by the agreement were to be performed by him, he claims payment by the defendants of the sum of $2,250. To this action the defendants pleaded a general denial of the material allegations in the statement of claim and thereby cast upon the plaintiff the burthen of proving the fulfilment of all the conditions precedent to be performed to entitle him as averred to the payment of the said sum of $2,225, and they also counter-claimed for a sum of $750. To this counter-claim it is unnecessary at present to allude while I deal with the plaintiff\u2019s claim to recover the sum of $2,250, which claim raises just two questions\u2014the first being as to the construction of the agreement, and the second, whether the plaintiff has shown the fulfilment by him of his part of the agreement, upon the fulfilment of which alone he could under the terms of the agreement become entitled to recover the sum demanded.\nThe agreement, as pointed out by Mr. Justice Moss in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, is certainly not drawn with that accuracy of expression which is usual in agreements for the sale of patent rights for inventions such as are in question. The agreement is plainly the work of an inexperienced draftsman, but nevertheless we can, I think, very clearly determine what is the true construction of the contract of the parties. The agreement bears date the 7th day of July, 1897, and in its first sentence it recites that the plaintiff\nhas applied for a patent and is the owner and inventor of the same for an acetylene gas machine for the Dominion of Canada for which a caveat has been granted.\nThis certainly is a very ill constructed sentence, and construed literally it contains a very inaccurate statement, for in point of fact the instrument itself further on shows that the plaintiff was not, nor did he claim to be, the inventor of an acetylene gas machine, nor had he applied for a patent for any such machine, nor filed a caveat specifying therein that he had invented such a machine. Acetylene gas machines were well known machines already in use as was well known to the plaintiff who in his caveat says:\nWhat I claim as my invention is in acetylene gas generators. 1st. The regulator F, with valve K operated by the spring X and catch N, acting automatically with the rise and fall of gas in the cap C, thus supplying just the right amount of water necessary to give a steady and practically uniform supply of gas.\n2nd. The ball-cock V operating the lever V, and valve V, which shuts off the spray of water from the holes M, in combination with the regulator F, as above described.\n3rd. The shaker F operated by the axis P, by partially revolving the lid D.\n4th. The pail D in combination with the lid D having the receptacle D and elastic tube M, the pail D being easily removable as specified.\nThe caveat specifying these particulars as being the invention of the plaintiff was filed in the patent office in Ottawa on the 21st of June, 1897, and reference to it in the agreement of the 7th July, 1897, is plainly made, as it appears to me, for the purpose of identifying the invention in respect of which the parties were dealing; and its operation and effect, as it appears to me, was to incorporate into the agreement the description which was in the caveat of the invention which the plaintiff claimed the right to have secured to him by letters patent, and for which the agreement recites that the plaintiff had \u201capplied for a patent.\u201d The filing of the caveat, in which the plaintiff\u2019s invention is set out at length and is claimed in precisely the same terms as would have been used in an application for letters patent for the invention, seems to have been deemed sufficient to justify the allegation that the plaintiff had applied for letters patent for that invention, and not unreasonably so as it appears to me; for there can be no doubt that what the parties were dealing with each other about, was the invention as so described by the plaintiff himself, and in an agreement for the purchase and sale of an invention which the vendor claimed to be patentable, it was natural and indeed necessary for the security of the purchasers that the agreement should contain a description of the invention.\nThe agreement proceeds to recite that negotiations had taken place for the absolute sale by the plaintiff to the defendants, \u201cof the said patent\u201d which words must be construed to mean \u201cof letters patent for said invention when issued and the agreement further proceeds to recite, that the plaintiff had agreed to sell the defendants all his (the plaintiff\u2019s)\nright, title and interest in the said patent not only for Canada but for all foreign countries as well.\nThis recital appears clearly to indicate that what the parties had in contemplation was the sale by the plaintiff and the purchase by the defendants of all the right, title and interest of the plaintiff in and to the said invention, and in all letters patent to be issued therefor, when the same should be issued, and the witness part of the agreement is in precise conformity with such construction, for by the agreement it is expressly witnessed that the party of the first part (the plaintiff) agrees to sell to the parties of the second part (the defendants)\nthe patent to manufacture said machine and all improvements and patents for such machine that he may hereafter make in connection with the same for $3,000 payable as follows, viz., by defendants promissory note for $750 payable within ten days after the issue of the letters patent for Canada for said machine, and the assignment to the said parties of the second part of the same, and the balance (or the $2,250 now claimed) within two months after the issuance of letters patent for the said patent for the United States of America and the assignment thereof.\nAnd by the said agreement the plaintiff covenanted with the defendants, to obtain the said patent to be issued for Canada and the United States of America, and to absolutely assign and set over the same to them, and that he will further assign to the defendants \u201calt interest in the said patent for every and all foreign countries.\u201d And the plaintiff by the said instrument did also absolutely assign and transfer and set over unto the defendants, \u201call his interest in and to the said invention,\u201d and did thereby absolutely give to the defendants\nfull authority to proceed and procure the said patent for Canada and the United States, in the event of the default of the plaintiff to procure the same within a reasonable time,\nand the plaintiff by the said instrument authorized the defendants themselves \u201cto at once proceed to manufacture and sell the said machine.\u201d\nThe inaptness of these words \u201cthe said machines\u201d has already been noticed. The plaintiff did not claim to be the inventor of an acetylene gas machine, nor of any machine, but merely of what he claimed to be certain new and useful improvements in acetylene gas generators, as specially claimed and described in the caveat of the 21st June, 1897. The words \u201cthe said machine\u201d when used in the agreement must be construed as \u201cthe said invention.\u201d Now from the above extracts from the said agreement it is, I think, abundantly clear that the subject matter of sale by the plaintiff and of purchase by the defendants was\u2014the whole right, title and interest of the plaintiff in and to all and singular the several particulars described in the caveat as being the invention of the plaintiff, including his right to have letters patent issued securing the benefit of such invention, and also the letters patent themselves when issued therefor in Canada and the United States respectively which letters patent the plaintiff covenanted to obtain and assign to the defendants, and also the monopoly of the benefit to be derived from use of the said invention which letters patent therefor granted in Canada and the United States respectively would secure. Upon the instant of the instrument of the 6th July, 1897, having been executed by the parties thereto the plaintiff parted with and vested in the defendants all right, title and interest of every description whatever of the plaintiff in his said invention according to his own description thereof as contained in the caveat and incorporated into the instrument of 7th July, 1897. The defendants eo instanti became the sole owners of that invention and of all benefit to be derived therefrom and of all letters patent to be issued, when issued, for that invention, and the defendants being such absolute owners of the said invention, and having been expressly authorised by their instrument of purchase thereof immediately to proceed to manufacture and sell acetylene gas machines with the plaintiff\u2019s invention applied thereto, before letters patent therefor should be obtained, and the plaintiff having expressly covenanted with the defendants that he would obtain \u201csaid patent,\u201d which here must be construed \u201cletters patent for said invention,\u201d to be issued for Canada and the United States respectively for which when issued and assigned to them the defendants agreed to pay $750 for the Canada letters patent and $2,250 for the United States letters patent when issued and assigned, it appears to me to be quite clear that the plaintiff did not retain in himself any right to make any alterations whatever in the said invention so transferred without the express consent and permission of the transferees, so that even assuming that inventors of patentable inventions who file a caveat in the Canada Patent Office describing their invention as in the caveat filed by the plaintiff on 21st June, 1897, might afterwards while still the owner of such invention and before obtaining letters patent therefor in Canada make alterations in their invention for the purpose of perfecting it still the plaintiff could retain no such right after transferring to the defendants absolutely all the plaintiff\u2019s right, title and interest in and to the said invention, but this matter although it seems to have occupied considerable attention at the trial seems to be quite irrelevant to the question which arises in this action and which relates wholly to the United States letters patent, the burthen of the issue resting wholly on the plaintiff to prove that the United States letters patent which he has obtained and the assignment of which he has tendered to the defendants, but which they refuse to accept as a fulfilment of the plaintiff\u2019s contract with them, do secure to the defendants the monopoly of the benefit of the precise invention as contracted for and purported to be transferred to the defendants by the instrument of July 7th, 1897.\nThe true construction of the words in that instrument whereby the plaintiff agrees to sell and sells to the defendants besides the said invention of the plaintiff and the letters patent to be issued therefor \u201call improvements\u201d and patents for such machine that he \u201cmay hereafter make in connection with the same\u201d is that if \u201chereafter\u201d that is, after the then completed absolute transfer to the defendants of the plaintiffs said invention, and after the issue of letters patent therefor the right to the absolute benefit of which was transferred to the defendants by the instrument of the 7th July, 1897, he the plaintiff should make any further improvements in the said invention so the property of the defendants, when the same should be patented such improvements in the patented invention and all letters patented therefor should be the property of the defendants. It is to be construed I think as a clause not a whit more clumsily framed than other clauses in the instrument, its purpose being to supply the place of a clause usually inserted in an instrument executed for the sale and purchase of patent rights within the meaning of sec. 9 of the Patent Act, ch. 61, R.S.C., its object and effect being to prevent an inventor of patentable inventions who sells his inventions from depriving his vendor of the benefit of his purchase by claiming to his own use the benefit of any further patentable improvements which he might make in the invention so sold and which might have the effect of depriving the vendee of the original invention of the benefit of his purchase thereof.\nIn fine the true construction of the instrument of the 7th July, 1897, being, as in my opinion it is, that the plaintiff thereby sold and the defendants bought absolutely the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s right, title and interest in and to what the plaintiff then claimed to be his invention in its entirety as then in existence and as shown to the defendants and as described in the caveat which by reference thereto in the instrument became incorporated therein, the negotiations between the plaintiff and defendants referred to in the instrument which resulted in the contract of sale and purchase set out in the instrument related to nothing else whatever, and if the plaintiff has failed for any reason (it matters not what) to obtain letters patent to issue for the United States which upon assignment to the defendants would secure to them the monopoly of the benefit of the whole of such matters so represented by the plaintiff to be his invention within the United States during the period prescribed by the patent laws of the United States, then he has failed to fulfil the conditions the fulfilment of which alone would entitle him to recover the sum of $2,250 demanded in the present action, and that the letters patent procured to be issued by the plaintiff for the United States and the assignment thereof tendered to the defendants do not secure to them such monopoly does not admit of a doubt for in those letters patent it appears that all that the plaintiff claimed as his invention and which he desired to have secured by the United States letters patent and all that was secured to him by those letters patent was:\u2014\nIn an acetylene gas generator, a gasometer and a generator with a lid D secured by slideable catches C, a ball-cock V being secured to the under side of said lid, to raise the rubber tipped piston B, to shut the water off from the spray holes, m, when the pail, D, is full of water in combination with the regulater F having valve K, spring X and arm or lever Y, substantially as and for the purpose specified.\nThese letters patent as proved by the plaintiff\u2019s own expert witness cover nothing more than a specific device for regulating the flow of water into the generator combined with a device for preventing an overflow of the water. It is not denied, indeed it is admitted by the plaintiff, that the whole of the device as appearing in the description of the plaintiff\u2019s invention in the caveat for agitating and breaking the lumps of carbide placed on the permanently fixed screen through which an axis was passed vertically, which being moved in the manner described in the caveat, certain catches, clamps or teeth were set in motion whereby the lumps of carbide placed on the permanently fixed screen in the generator were in a most effective manner broken and the greatest possible proportion of surface of carbide was exposed to the action of the water, is wholly omitted. Now this device I think the evidence establishes to have been the essential element of the plaintiff\u2019s invention as described in the caveat and constituted the chief value in the opinion of the defendants and those upon whose advice they were purchasing of what the plaintiff claimed as his invention, as shown to the defendants, and the most important part of the subject matters in respect of which all the negotiations mentioned in the instrument of the 7th July, 1897, which resulted in the contract contained in that instrument took place and which formed the essential motive which induced the defendants to enter into that contract.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s sole explanation of this part not having been covered by the United States letters patent, is that subsequently to the sale of his invention to the defendants by the instrument of the 7th July, 1897, he substituted for the device for breaking the lumps of carbide as described in his caveat filed at Ottawa, a tilting grate which appears in truth to be nothing else than the most common kind of grate in ordinary use in coal burning stoves, for removing the ashes. To any one who observes the construction and operation of such grate it is quite apparent that there is no novelty in it whatever, and therefore that it is not a patentable device at all. The plaintiff however suggests that it is applied by him to acetylene gas machines as an equivalent for the very effective device for breaking the lumps of carbide, as originally designed by the plaintiff and described in the caveat filed in the Ottawa patent office. That is to say, he contends that the substitution of a non-patentable device, and which therefore every one may use, is an equivalent for a device which he sold to the defendants as a patentable device of his own invention, and for securing to the defendants the monopoly of the benefit of the use of which throughout the United States he covenanted with the defendants to procure letters patent to issue for the United States and to assign such letters patent to them. Now the plaintiffs own expert witness tells us that the United States letters patent do not cover the device which the plaintiff claims to be a substituted equivalent for the original device omitted, because of the fact that there was no novelty in such substituted device, and it was therefore not capable of being secured by letters patent. But in fact there arises no question as to the substitutionary equivalents; what the plaintiff designates under that term is, as plainly appears, nothing else than an attempt by one of two contracting parties to alter the terms of a completed contract signed and sealed to the prejudice of the other, without the consent of such other. It thus conclusively, I think, appears that the letters patent which the plaintiff has procured in the United States, and the assignment thereof tendered to the defendants, do not secure to the defendants the monopoly of the use of what the plaintiff sold to the defendants as his invention, and are not such letters patent as the plaintiff by the instrument of the 7th July, 1897, covenanted with the defendants to procure and to assign to them. This appeal, therefore, should in my opinion be allowed with costs, and the plaintiff\u2019s action should be dismissed with costs.\nNow as to the counterclaim which is to recover $750 paid by the defendants to the plaintiff upon the assignment by the latter of certain letters patent issued in Canada, which sum the defendants claim a right to recover upon the allegation that since the payment of that sum to the plaintiff they have learned that the Canada letters patent so assigned to them do not secure the rights which the plaintiff by his agreement of 7th July, 1897, covenanted that they should secure. It certainly appears by the evidence adduced in relation to the plaintiff\u2019s claim in the action that the defendants might have refused to accept the Canadian letters patent, and to pay the $750 equally, as they have refused to accept the United States letters patent, and to pay $2,250 claimed in the action, for the former letters patent no more fulfil the obligation of the plaintiff involved in his covenant contained in the instrument of July 7th, 1897, than do the latter, but the defendants paid the $750 in the erroneous belief that the Canadian letters patent did secure to the defendants in Canada the benefit of the device which as the invention of the plaintiff they had contracted for. It appears also that after such payment they purchased from the plaintiff his patent rights over three counties in Ontario which he had reserved by the agreement of the 7th July, 1897, but notwithstanding these circumstances the defendants are I think entitled to be reimbursed by the plaintiff in respect of their being paid the $750 in the erroneous belief that the Canada letters patent had secured to them what they had purchased and what the plaintiff covenanted they should secure to the defendants whereas it appears that they do nothing of the kind, and in my opinion the claim of the defendants is sufficiently stated in their counter-claim to entitle them to recover thereunder the redress to which they are entitled; however as my learned brothers are of opinion that under the counter-claim as framed the defendants cannot recover, the judgment of the counter claim remains undisturbed. SEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the cross\u2011appeal dismissed.\nKING J.\u2014I am of the same opinion but think the respondent should be allowed his costs on the cross-appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs and cross-appeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Biggar & McBrayne.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Raymond & Cohoe.\n[1] 30 L.J.

M. having died, his executors executed a deed of confirmation to the purchaser of No. 5 from the trustees of the marriage settlement by a description which, it was claimed by the purchaser, conveyed absolutely the freehold estate in the party wall and the land covered by it. An action being brought by the executors of M. to have it declared that the wall in question was a party wall.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that the trustees of the will and marriage settlement were bound by the trust declared in the instruments under which they derived their powers, and even if it could be shown that the confirmation deed had the effect of conveying a greater quantity of land than the deed from the trustees of the marriage settlement, such a voluntary conveyance in favour of one beneficiary, which would operate prejudicially to the interests of the other beneficiaries would be a breach of trust and conseqently void.\nHeld, that upon the execution of the deed by way of marriage settlement of No. 5, the wall common to the two warehouses, Nos. 5 and 7, became a party wall of which the owners of the warehouses were tenants in common.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which reversed the judgment of the trial court, Falconbridge J., and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action with costs.\nA statement of the case appears in the judgment reported.\nShepley Q.C. for the appellants.\nG.G. Mills for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014In 1876 the late Mr. Charles Moore was the owner of three warehouses situate on the south side of Wellington (formerly Market) street, in the City of Toronto, respectively numbered as five, seven and nine. The warehouses numbers five and seven, which alone are in question in this litigation, were adjoining buildings having a party wall between them i.e., a wall on which both the warehouses numbers five and seven, were dependent for support.\nOn the 18th of April, 1876, Mr. Moore executed a deed by way of a marriage settlement on his daughter Lilias Graham Moore (now Mrs. Warren), whereby he conveyed to Frederick John Stewart and John Edward Rose, warehouse number 5, by a description which gave a frontage of twenty-five feet (not adding the words more or less), along Wellington street westerly from the point of commencement, which point of commencement is fixed at a distance of seventy-eight feet (not adding the words more or less), from the northeast angle of Wellington and Yonge streets, thence south eighty-eight feet more or less, thence easterly twenty-five feet (not saying more or less), thence north eighty-eight feet more or less. It is to be remarked that whilst in the description the words \u201cmore or less\u201d are used in connection with the easterly and westerly boundaries, there are no such words of extension added to the northerly and southerly boun- daries. If the description had stopped here the trustees of the settlement would obviously have been entitled to but twenty-five feet on Wellington street, neither more nor less. The description by metes and bounds is however supplemented by the following words \u201csaid property being known as the warehouse No. 5 Wellington street west.\u201d Therefore any extension which the trustees could rightfully claim under the description, beyond a frontage of twenty-five feet, must depend altogether on these added words. Under the trusts of the settlement (which took effect a short time afterwards on the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Warren), the trustees had amongst other things power to sell the settled property.\nBy his will dated in May, 1876, Mr. Moore devised all his real estate to his executors, Berry Moore, James Moore and the plaintiffs in the present action, who are now the surviving executors, upon certain trusts therein declared, one of which was a trust to sell. The testator died in August, 1876.\nIn March, 1883, the trustees under the settlement agreed to sell the settled property, warehouse No. 5, to the respondent Thomas Alison, for $9,500, and by an indenture dated the 22nd day of March, 1883, they conveyed the property to the respondent, Thomas Alison, in fee, by a description which was an exact transcript of that by which it had been conveyed to them in the deed of settlement. $6,000 of the purchase money was to remain on mortgage, but before executing the mortgage deed the respondent, Thomas Alison, raised a question as to the sufficiency of the description which he contended should be in accordance with a survey he had procured to be made by certain named surveyors who had as the result of their survey prepared what Mr. Alison claimed to be the correct description, and a draft deed was accordingly pre- pared to which the surviving executors were parties, and by which it was proposed they should convey (by way of confirmation) to Mr. Alison, by a description of the land taken from the survey mentioned. This draft deed, however, coming to the hands of Mr. Justice Rose, who as one of the vendors, was of course concerned in seeing that the sale was properly carried out, he (as might have been expected) not being willing that the executors should commit a breach of trust to which he would have appeared to have been a consenting party, altered the description of the parcels so that this deed of confirmation when executed contained the following description:\nAnd all and singular, the interest, estate and demand of the said Charles Moore, or any other interest which they can convey in and to all and singular the lands and premises upon which the said store No. 5 is situate, whether the same be twenty-five feet in width, or more or less,\nthis being a description which rendered the deed one which the executors might safely execute, and moreover one accurately carrying out the evident intention of the settler, which was that the whole of the warehouse No. 5 should pass without any limitation arising from the description by metes and bounds, or from want of the words \u201cmore or less.\u201d I should have said that this last deed which was executed on the 31st of March, 1883, contained a recital of the description furnished by Mr. Alison\u2019s surveyors, which as a good deal of importance has been attached to it, I will give in full; it is as follows:\nAnd whereas it appears from a survey of the said property made the 8th day of March, A.D. 1883, by Unwin Browne & Sankey, provincial land surveyors, of the said City of Toronto, for said Alison, and the said Alison claims the fact to be, that the correct description of the land upon which the same warehouse stands is as follows, namely:\nAll and singular that certain parcel or tract of land and premises containing by admeasurement 2,386 square feet, more or less, being composed of a part of town lot no. 2, on the south side of Market (now Wellington) street, in the City of Toronto, aforesaid; commencing at a point on the southern limit of Market (now Wellington) street west, distant 77 feet 8 inches, measured westerly along said limit of said street from the western limit of Yonge street, said point being the intersection of the eastern face of brick wall of warehouse no. 5 Wellington street west with the said limit of Wellington west, thence south 74 degrees west along said last mentioned limit 26 feet 7 inches to the western face of a brick wall of said warehouse, thence south 16 degrees east along last mentioned face of brick wall 89 feet 8\u00bd inches to the northern boundary of lot deeded to Hugh Carfrae, or 120 feet less than the southern boundary of said lot, thence north 74 degrees east along last mentioned boundary 26 feet 7 inches to the eastern face of first mentioned brick wall, thence north 16 degrees west along said face of last mentioned brick wall, 89 feet 8\u00bd inches, more or less, to the point of commencement.\nThe purchase was then completed by the payment of the cash portion of the purchase money a mortgage being given for the unpaid residue. This mortgage contained a description not following the deed of settlement but embracing the description prepared by the surveyors and carrying the western boundary of the mortgaged property to the west face of the west wall of warehouse number 5.\nSubsequently, and in 1894, this mortgage was paid off and a transfer of it taken to the respondent Mrs. Alison, the wife of the purchaser Thomas Alison.\nThe respondents claiming title to the whole of the west wall of no. 5 that is to the whole of the wall between no. 5 and no. 7 upon which both warehouses depended for support, the appellants who were the surviving executors and trustees under the will of Charles Moore brought the present action claiming a declaration that the wall between warehouses nos. 5 and 7 was a party wall, alleging that the appellants and respondents are the owners of the land on which the wall is erected as tenants in common and that the defendants should be restrained from interfering with the use and enjoyment by the appellants of the said wall as a party wall.\nThe respondents set up several defences the principal of which were founded on the deed of the 31st of March, 1883, and on the mortgage given by Alison which had been paid off by and transferred to his wife.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Falconbridge who pronounced a decree declaring the appellants and respondents to be tenants in common of the wall and of the land upon which it is erected and enjoining the respondents from interfering with the use and enjoyment of the wall by the appellants as a party wall.\nFrom this judgment the respondents appealed to the Court of Appeal when that court (the Chief Justice dissenting) allowed the appeal and dismissed the action with costs.\nI will in the first place dispose of the pretentions of Mrs. Alison as mortgagee to some superior right, as a purchaser for valuable consideration without notice, by saying that this respondent is not in a position to say she had no notice of the equities and titles which may bind her husband since these appear on the registered title. Further Mrs. Alison is not a purchaser without notice inasmuch as the rights which the appellants claim to have declared are all based on the title deeds under which she claims. Mrs. Alison must therefore be deemed to have constructive notice, (apart altogether from registration,) of everything which appears on the face of the title deeds under which she claims.\nOne observation may be made which applies to both sets of trustees\u2014those of the settlement as well as those under the will\u2014namely that they were bound by the trusts declared in the instruments under which they respectively derived their powers, the marriage settlement and the will, in each of which there was contained a power of sale, no power of gratuitous disposition being, however, conferred either in the one or the other instrument. Consequently any voluntary conveyance of land by the executors in augmentation of what the testator had conveyed to his daughter\u2019s trustees for the purpose of the settlement would be a breach of trust and void, and the court is bound to regard it as such in any declaration of title which it may make.\nThe description contained in the deed of settlement was manifestly intended to include the whole of warehouse no. 5, and no technical argument derived from cases showing that a description by metes and bounds ought to control it and limit the property conveyed to the twenty-five feet frontage ought to be allowed to prevail; all the surrounding circumstances show that what the settlor intended to give to his daughter was just that which was described in the trust deed, neither more nor less, and this composed the whole of warehouse no. 5. The description of the parcels granted contained in the deed of the 31st of March, 1883 (I do not mean the description in the recital but that in the granting part), carries this into effect in plainer and more precise language, but it does not add in the least to the property which passed under the deed of 1876 by its own force.\nThe recourse to surveyors and to descriptions prepared by them was therefore wholly inadmissible. All that was intended by the settlor to pass to his daughter\u2019s trustees was ascertainable from the settlement deed itself\u2014it was warehouse no. 5\u2014then if it was so ascertainable there was no necessity for any survey or additional description by surveyors; if on the other hand the description prepared by the latter contained more than the trust deed, any voluntary conveyance by the executors according to its terms would have been a breach of trust and void. It was quite legitimate for the executors to render the description clearer, as they have done by executing the deed of 31st March, but if they had exceeded this and attempted to convey gratuitously and without consideration any part of the land which had passed to them under the will, their conveyance would have been in violation of their trust and absolutely void. That the executors did not so exceed their powers I think clear.\nThe recital of the survey and the description consequent thereon had not the effect of making the land so described the subject of the grant. As a rule all recitals in an indenture must be taken to be true and to be treated as a statement binding all parties who execute the deed. But the recital here is not that, in fact, the true description was that prepared by Unwin & Co., but merely the fact that Unwin & Co. had made a survey for Alison, and that Alison claimed the fact to be that their description was a correct one.\nThis is very far from being a statement in recital of the absolute fact that the description was a correct one. The whole contention is too clear for argument, and the answer given to it by Mr. Justice Falconbridge is right and conclusive. The question therefore is just the same as if it had arisen immediately after the execution of the deed of settlement between Mr. Moore himself and his daughter\u2019s trustees, and is confined strictly to the construction of the description in that deed.\nWe are then brought to this: What is included in the description \u201cWarehouse No. 5, Wellington street west\u201d? The measurements and boundaries stated in the paper prepared by the respondents\u2019 surveyors was manifestly not the proper legal description of this building if the whole of the western wall was not according to proper legal construction included in the denomination of warehouse no. 5. Whether the whole of this western wall ought to be so included is a legal question, and the very question in dispute in this action, and this the surveyors improperly assumed in the respondents\u2019 favour.\nThen what were the rights of the respective parties, Mr. Moore and his daughter\u2019s trustees, immediately after the marriage? The trustees became the owners of warehouse no. 5 by that bare description, and Mr. Moore remained the owner of warehouse no. 7, and the wall which was common to the two houses could, up to the time of the separation of the two properties, be no more said to belong to and be part of no. 5 than it could be said to belong to and be part of no. 7. This it must be remembered is no question of easements; what we have to adjudicate upon is the right to the land on which this party wall is built. The appellants if they had chosen might have claimed that the wall on the separation of the properties vested in the respective owners in severalty each for one half of the wall divided laterally, or they might have claimed easements, but the only right insisted on by the appellants is that they should be declared tenants in common of the wall and the land on which it stands.\nIn the case of Watson v. Gray[1] Fry J. makes the following observations:\nThe words party wall may be used in four different senses. First, as meaning a wall of which the two adjoining owners are tenants in common, as in Wiltshire v. Sidford[2], and in Cubitt v. Porter[3], and that is possibly the primary meaning of the phrase. Secondly, as meaning a wall divided longitudinally into two strips, one belonging to each of the neighbouring owners, as in Matts v. Hawkins[4]. Thirdly, as meaning a wall which belongs entirely to one of the adjoining owners, but is subject to an easement or right in the other to have it maintained as a dividing wall between the two tenements; and fourthly, as meaning a wall divided longitudinally into two moieties each moiety being subject to a cross easement in favour of the owner of the other moiety.\nCan it be said that the learned trial judge was wrong in ascribing to this wall the character of a party wall according to the first of these definitions given by Fry J.? I think not. The wall had been used by Mr. Moore for the purposes of both no. 5 and no. 7; it was as much part of the one building as of the other. In saying this I am not losing sight of the fact that no. 5 had been built some time before no. 7, and that this wall had originally wholly belonged to no. 5. What we have to consider, however, is the state of the two tenements 5 and 7 at the date of the settlement, when beyond doubt this wall was common to both buildings. Then as it would be a most unreasonable presumption to make to hold that it was intended to convey any part of no. 7, we must necessarily conclude that it was intended that after the severance of the title the wall should be still used for the common purposes of both the warehouses which prim\u00e2 facie would make the owners tenants in common.\nThis seems to have been the opinion of Mr. Justice Bayley who in Wiltshire v. Sidford[5] thus expresses himself:\nWhere the builder of two houses grants off one it is more reasonable to presume he grants the whole wall in undivided moieties than that he should leave either party the power of cutting the wall in half.\nThe presumption of a tenancy in common of a party wall is certainly the proper conclusion where the origin of the party wall cannot be ascertained, but this is not that case for we have full information as to the construction of the wall. If the wall belongs to the owners of no. 5 and no. 7 as tenants in common, either party may be entitled to a partition of the wall[6]; and that partition may be made either free from or subject to mutual easements for support.\nHad the appellants claimed that this was a party wall in which the adjoining owners had several rights with reciprocal easements according to the fourth head of Mr. Justice Fry\u2019s classification there would have been a question as to the right to easements which does not here arise. For this reason all the argument in the respondents\u2019 factum about the applicability of the principle of Wheeldon v. Burrowes[7] is irrelevant. Further, even if Wheeldon v. Burrowes7 did apply it would not be conclusive against the presumed retention of an easement by the settlor, Mr. Moore, in respect of no. 7. In giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Wheeldon v. Burrows7, Thesiger J. expressly excepts easements of necessity such as were considered to have been reserved in Richards v. Rose[8], which he recognises as good law. The Lord Justice there says:\nTwo houses had existed for some time each supporting the other. Is there anything unreasonable\u2014is there not on the contrary something very reasonable\u2014to suppose in that case that the man who takes a grant of the house first and takes with the right of support from that adjoining house should also give to that adjoining house a reciprocal right of support from his own?\nIn Suffield v. Brown[9], Lord Westbury\u2019s judgment, which is the fountain head of all this doctrine against the presumed reservation of easements, contains the following passage:\nIt is true that there may be two tenements, as for example, two adjoining houses so constructed as to be mutually subservient and to depend on each other, neither being capable of standing or being enjoyed without the support it derives from its neighbour; in which case the alienation of one house by the owner of both would not estop him from claiming in respect of the house he retains, that support from the house sold which is at the same time afforded in return by the former to the latter tenement, which was the case of Richards v. Rose8.\nTherefore even if this has been the case in which the appellants were claiming an easement for support for no. 7, instead of as it is a claim to the land itself, nothing in Wheeldon v. Burrowes[10], would have operated against the presumed reservation of such an easement.\nWere it open to us to do so I should have been prepared to have made a slight alteration in the original judgment by inserting a declaration as to easements in case of a partition of the wall. This however has not been asked for by the appellants, and probably they can safely rely on the protection of their rights in this respect in any judgment for partition which may hereafter be obtained.\nThe result is that the appeal must be allowed with costs to the appellants in this court and in the Court of Appeal, and the judgment pronounced by Mr. Justice Falconbridge must be restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Maclaren, Macdonald, Shepley & Middleton.\nSolicitors for respondents: Mills, Mills & Hales.\n[1] 14 Ch.

Where the cause is transferred because the pleas ousted the County Court of jurisdiction an appeal lies.\nLeave to appeal cannot be granted under 60 & 61 V. c. 34 s. 1 (e), in a case not appealable under the general provisions of R.S.C. ch. 135.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the ruling of the Drainage Referee who dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action.\nThe action was begun by a writ issued out of the County Court of the County of Lambton to recover damages for injury to plaintiffs land by water brought upon it from drains constructed by defendant on his own land. Defendant pleaded, inter alia, want of jurisdiction in the court and, as soon as issue was joined, the cause was transferred to the High Court of Justice by order of the County Court Judge exercising the jurisdiction of a local Judge of the High Court. The order of transfer states that the jurisdiction of the County Court was properly and bon\u00e2 fide brought in question.\nAt the trial a reference was ordered to the Drainage Referee who held that plaintiff had no cause of action, which holding was reversed by the Court of Appeal on appeal from his report. On the appeal to the Supreme Court coming on for hearing, counsel for respondent moved to quash for want of jurisdiction, claiming that the action did not originate in a Superior Court.\nAylesworth Q.C. for the motion.\nRiddell Q.C. contra, argued that the case did originate in a Superior Court, but if not, that leave to appeal should be granted under 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 34, sec. 1 (e).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (oral).\u2014Section 24 (a) of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act gives jurisdiction to this court to entertain appeals \u201cfrom all final judgments of the highest court of final resort * * * in cases in which the court of original jurisdiction is a Superior Court.\u201d And section 28 gives jurisdiction in appeals from final judgments \u201cin actions, suits, &c., originally instituted in a Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, or originally instituted in a Superior Court in any of the Provinces of Canada other than the Province of Quebec.\u201d\nAs we have no jurisdiction unless the case in appeal originated in the Superior Court, how can we entertain this appeal? The institution of a suit is the writ bringing the defendant into court, and the writ in this case issued out of a county court. This objection cannot be got over by saying that some subsequent proceeding in the cause was equivalent to what the Act requires. The appeal must be quashed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am also of opinion that the appeal must be quashed as the case did not originate in a Superior Court.\nAs to the motion for special leave to appeal under subsec. (e), sec. 1 of 60 & 61 V. c. 34, it clearly cannot be granted. That enactment merely gives us the right to grant special leave in that class of cases which were previously appealable, but which are by that Act. 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 34, decreed not to be thereafter appealable de plano, and this is not a case of that class.\nGWYNNE J. (dissenting.)\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Osler that this case must be regarded as having originated in a Superior Court within the meaning of the section of the Act regulating appeals to this court from the judgments of a Superior Court. True it is that the plaintiff had commenced an action in the County Court of the County of Lambton to which the defendant pleaded pleas which ousted all jurisdiction of the County Court, whereupon all proceedings then had in the County Court were, by reason of the absence of jurisdiction in the County Court to entertain the matter, transferred to the High Court of Justice as the only court having jurisdiction in the matter under the provisions of section one hundred and eighty-six, R.S.O. (1897) ch. 51. Now it is from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, pronounced in appeal from a judgment of the High Court of Justice in Ontario, that the present appeal is taken, and such appeal is from the judgment of the highest court of appeal in Ontario in a case in which the High Court of Justice, being a superior court, alone had original jurisdiction. That is a point which, as it appears to me, is concluded by the transfer of the case from the County Court for want of jurisdiction to entertain it. The appeal, therefore, in my opinion, lies, and the motion to quash should be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Taschereau.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A. Weir.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Kittermaster & Gurd.\n[1] 26 Ont. App. R. 162.\n"}

(1887) c. 120, ss. 1 and 5.\nHeld, per Strong C.J. and Gwynne J., (Taschereau and Sedgewick JJ. contra,) that under sec. 26, subsec. 3, of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, leave to appeal direct from a judgment of a divisional court of the High Court of Justice for Ontario may be granted in cases where there is no right of appeal to the Court of Appeal.\nBy R. S. O. (1887) ch. 120, sec. 1, all persons are prohibited from preventing the passage of saw-logs and other timber down a river, creek or stream by felling trees or placing any other obstruction in or across the same.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Queen's Bench Division (29 O. R. 206), that placing a dam on a river or stream by which the supply of water therein was diminished so as to interfere with the passage of logs was an obstruction under this Act.\nAppeal from a decision of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice[1] affirming the judgment of Boyd C. at the trial.\nR. S. O. (1887) ch. 120, sec. 1 contains the following provision:\n\"All persons shall, subject to the provisions in this Act contained, have, and are hereby declared always to have had, during the spring, summer and autumn freshets, the right to, and may float and transmit sawlogs and all other timber of every kind, and all rafts and crafts, down all rivers, creeks and streams; and no person shall by felling trees or placing any other obstruction in or across any such river, creek or stream, prevent the passage thereof.\"\nThe defendant maintained two dams on Bear Greek, in the County of Lambton, Ont., for using water in its business of refining oil. The dams diminished the water in the creek so as to injure plaintiff who was accustomed to use it for floating his logs down. The question for decision on this appeal was whether or not the dams constituted an obstruction under the above section and entitled plaintiff to maintain an action for damages against the company for the loss suffered by hindrance to his business.\nThe Chancellor who tried the case held that the dams were not an obstruction under the Act, and his judgment was confirmed by the Divisional Court.\nThe appellants applied to the Registrar, sitting as a Judge in Chambers, for an order granting leave to appeal direct from the latter judgment which was refused. On appeal to Mr. Justice Gwynne in Chambers the order was granted.\nHis Lordship's judgment on said appeal was as follows:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an appeal from the decision of the Registrar in Chambers upon a motion made by the plaintiff for leave to appeal, and for approval of the bond in appeal. The learned registrar refused the motion partly on the ground that in his judgment this court has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal under the circumstances appearing, and further that if it has such jurisdiction, it ought not to be exercised in the present case.\nBy the Supreme Court Act, 38 Vict. ch. 11, sec. 17, it is enacted as follows:\nSubject to the limitations and provisions hereinafter made, an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from all final judgments of the highest court of final resort whether such court be a court of appeal or of original jurisdiction, now or hereafter established in any province of Canada in cases in which the court of original jurisdiction is a Superior Court. Provided that no appeal shall be allowed from any judgment rendered in the Province of Quebec in any case wherein the sum or value of the matter in dispute does not amount to two thousand dollars, and the right to appeal in civil cases given by this Act shall be understood to be given in such cases only as are mentioned in this section, except Exchequer cases and cases of mandamus, habeas corpus or municipal by-laws, as hereinafter provided.\nIn view of this section in connection with sections 11 and 23 it was by a judgment of this court rendered on the 16th of April, 1879, in Danjou v. Marquis[2], held by the court, Fournier and Henry JJ. dissenting, that the appeal given in cases of mandamus under sec. 23, is restricted to decisions of the highest court of final resort in the province, and that an appeal did not lie from any court in the Province of Quebec but the Court of Queen's Bench, and consequently the appeal which was from the judgment of the Superior Court of the District of Rimouski was quashed.\nThe learned registrar was of opinion that the case now under consideration was concluded by the judgment in the above case.\nBy an Act passed on the 15th May, 1879, intituled \"An Act further to amend the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act,\" 42 Vict. ch. 39, it was enacted in sec. 5 as follows:\nExcept as hereinafter provided for no appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court but from the highest court of last resort having jurisdiction in the province in which the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding was originally instituted, whether the judgment or decision in such action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding may or may not have been a proper subject of appeal to such highest court of last resort.\nThe exception provided for in this section 5 is thus stated in sec. 6:\nAn appeal shall lie to the said Supreme Court by leave of the said last mentioned court or a judge thereof from any decree, decretal order, or order made or pronounced by a superior court of equity or made or pronounced by any equity judge or by any superior court in any action, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding in the nature of a suit or proceeding in equity, and from the final judgment of any superior court of any province other than the Province of Quebec in any action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding originally commenced in such superior court without any intermediate appeal being had to any intermediate court of appeal in the the province.\nBy the Ontario Judicature Act of 1881, 44 Vict. ch. 5, the several Superior Courts then in existence in Ontario were consolidated together under the name of the Supreme Court of Judicature for Ontario, which court was declared to consist of two permanent divisions, one of which, consisting of the Courts of Queen's Bench, Chancery and Common Pleas, to be called \"The High Court of Justice for Ontario,\" and that the Court of Appeal should constitute the other division, which court the Act declared should continue to have all the jurisdiction which the said court theretofore had save as varied by the Act. The Act then provided for appeals from the divisional courts to the Court of Appeal. This Act assumed to control the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada by the following section no. 43:\n43. No appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada without the special leave of such court or of the Court of Appeal unless the title to real estate or some interest therein, or the validity of a patent is affected; or unless the matter in controversy on the appeal exceeds the sum or value of $1,000, exclusive of costs or unless the matter in question relates to the taking of an annual or other rent, customary or other duty or fee, or a like demand of a general or public nature affecting future rights.\nIn Clarkson v. Ryan[3], and in other cases, this court held this section to be simply nugatory as beings ultra vires of the provincial legislature to enact. Then by the Ontario Statute, 58 Vict. ch. 13, it was enacted in sec. 2 that there should be no more than one appeal in the Province of Ontario from any judgment or order made in any action or matter save only at the instance of the Crown in a case in which the Crown is concerned, and save in certain other cases in the Act specified.\nBy sec. 10 it was enacted that:\nThe Queen's Bench, Chancery and Common Pleas Divisions of the High Court shall not sit or give judgments as such divisions (except for the purposes of the Criminal Code, 1892,) and there shall not be divisional courts of any of the said divisions; but the divisional courts shall be divisional courts of the High Court without reference to the said divisions.\nAnd these Divisional Courts were made Courts of Appeal as well as courts of original jurisdiction by sec. 11 which enacted that\nan appeal shall lie to a divisional court of the High Court instead of as heretofore provided by any statute or rule of court.\nHere follow twelve enumerated cases including item 3:\nFrom any judgment or order of a judge of the High Court in court.\nThen by sec. 13 it was among other things enacted in sub-sec. 2:\nIn case after this Act goes into effect a party appeals to a divisional court of the High Court in a case in which an appeal lies to the Court of Appeal, the party so appealing shall not be entitled to after wards appeal from the said divisional court to the Court of Appeal, but any other party to the action or matter may appeal to the Court of Appeal from the judgment or order of the divisional court. Then the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal was retained by sec. 14 which enacted that:\u2014\nSubject to the exceptions and provisions contained in this Act, an appeal shall lie to the Court of Appeal from every judgment, order or decision of the High Court, whether the judgment, order or decision was that of a divisional court or of a judge in court, and including cases tried with a jury, where the appellant complains of the judgment and asks in the alternative for a new trial.\nThe secs. 11, 13 and 14 of this Act appear also in identical language in sees. 71, 72 and 73 of the Judicature Act of 1895, passed on the same day as 58 Vict. ch. 12.\nNow by 59 Vict. ch. 18, sub-sec. 3 of above sec. 73, identical with sec. 14 of 58 Vict. ch. 13, was amended so as to read as follows:\nExcept where an appeal lies under the preceding clause from a divisional court to the Court of Appeal, an appeal shall not lie from a judgment or order of a divisional court pronounced on an appeal in a cause or matter in the High Court to such divisional court except by special leave first obtained on application to such divisional court or to the Court of Appeal or to a judge thereof.\nThen all of the above sections with the above amendment as made by 59 Vict. ch. 18 are consolidated as secs. 75, 76 and 77 of the Judicature Act R. S. O. (1897) ch. 51, and as so consolidated the result as it appears to me is this.\nBy sec. 75 appellate jurisdiction is given to divisional courts in the following cases:\n1. From any judgment or order of a judge of the High Court in court, whether at the trial or otherwise.\n2. From the Master in Ordinary.\n3. From County Courts.\n4. From Surrogate Courts, and in five other enumerated cases.\nBy sec. 76 the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is retained subject to the exceptions and provisions in the Act mentioned, from every judgment, order or decision of the High Court whether the judgment, order or decision was that of a Divisional Court or of a judge in court, including cases tried with a jury where the appellant complains of the judgment and asks for a new trial.\nNow the present case is that of an action brought by the plaintiff in the High Court of Justice for Ontario in which action judgment was rendered against the plaintiff, and his action was dismissed by a judge of the High Court in court. It was a case, therefore, in which the Court of Appeal and a divisional court of the High Court had co-ordinate appellate jurisdiction. The plaintiff elected to appeal from the judgment of a judge of the High Court in court pronounced in an action commenced in the High Court, to a divisional court, which court dismissed his appeal and affirmed the judgment of the High Court dismissing the action; the case therefore comes within the second sub-section of sea 77 of ch. 51 R. S. O. (1897).\n58 Vict. ch. 13 was passed as its title shows for the purpose of diminishing appeals in the Ontario Courts and the first, sub-sec. of sec. 13 of that Act, and the first sub-sec. of sec. 73 of 58 Vict. ch. 12, which are identical, are consolidated as sec. 74 of R. S. O. (1897), ch. 51, which enacts as follows:\nThere shall not be more than one appeal in this province from any judgment or order made in any action or matter, save only at the instance of the Crown in a case in which the Crown is concerned; and save in certain other cases hereinafter specified.\nThen sec. 75 prescribes the cases in which the divisional courts shall have appellate jurisdiction, that is to say, in ten enumerated cases, the first of which is the present case, namely from a judgment pronounced in an action pending in the High Court by a judge of that court in court. The other nine cases are cases in which no direct or co-ordinate appeal is given. to the Court of Appeal, and in which therefore a party desiring to appeal has no choice as to which court he should appeal, namely, whether to the Court of Appeal or to a Divisional Court, but must appeal to a Divisional Court if he appeals at all. Then sec. 76 defines the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals and gives it, subject to the exceptions and conditions contained in the Act, appellate jurisdiction\nfrom every judgment, order or decision of the High Court whether the judgment, order or decision was that of a divisional court or of a judge in court, and including cases tried with a jury where the appellant complains of the judgment and asks in the alternative for a new trial.\nThis section, therefore, gives to the Court of Appeal co-ordinate jurisdiction in appeal with the divisional courts, over judgments coming within item no. 1 of sec. 75, and absolute jurisdiction in appeal from all judgments pronounced by a divisional court in appeal in the nine other items enumerated in sec. 75.\nThen in sub-section 2 of sec. 77 is stated the first exception subject to which jurisdiction is given by the Court of Appeal by sec. 76, and this exception, in my opinion, is absolute and imperative, and itself is subject to no qualification whatever, and its effect is that a party appealing to a divisional court instead of to the Court of Appeal in a case in which he might have appealed direct to the Court of Appeal (as is the present case) shall have no appeal whatever to the Court of Appeal from the judgment of the divisional court, the tribunal in appeal of his own selection. In such a case the judgment of the divisional court in appeal, is absolutely final and conclusive and is the judgment of the only court of final resort which under the circumstances had jurisdiction within the Province of Ontario in the particular case in which such judgment was rendered, save only that in such a case any other party to the action or matter so appealed to a divisional court then the appellant therein shall have an appeal to the Court of Appeal from the judgment of the divisional court in appeal, such \"other party\" is the only person to whom any appeal to the Court of Appeal is given in the case put in sub-section 2\nSub-section 2 of sec. 77 \"having thus provided absolutely for the case of a party appealing to a divisional court in a case in which instead of so appealing he might have appealed to the Court of Appeal, the sub-sec. 3 of the sec. 77 states the second exception to which the jurisdiction given to the Court of Appeal by sec. 76 is subjected, namely, that with the exception of the appeal given by sub-sec. 2 to a party other than the appellant to a divisional court in the case there put there shall be no appeal to the Court of Appeal from any judgment whatever of a divisional court of the High Court in appeal without leave first obtained either from the divisional court pronouncing the judgment in appeal, or from the Court of Appeal or a judge thereof, and so no appeal to the Court of Appeal without special leave first so obtained, even in cases of appeal enumerated in sec. 75 in which subordinate and not co-ordinate jurisdiction in appeal is given to divisional courts.\nSub-sec. 3 of the sec. 77 does not profess to give an appeal in a case not already provided for, but to prescribe limitations within which the right of appeal to the Court of Appeal already given by the Act shall be exercised. That sub-section cannot, in my opinion be construed as giving by implication a further appeal to the Court of Appeal from the judgment of a divisional court in appeal to a person who, having had the right to elect to which court as a court of final resort he should appeal, namely, to the Court of Appeal or to a divisional court, had selected the latter, and in which case the immediately preceding sub-section 2 had unequivocally declared that such person should have no further appeal. Upon the whole therefore, the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal as prescribed by sec. 76 is qualified by these exceptions and provisions, namely, that in a case wherein co-ordinate jurisdiction in appeal is given to divisional courts and to the Court of Appeal, and a party thereto having the option to appeal to either elects to appeal to a divisional court there shall no appeal lie from the judgment of such divisional court in appeal save at the suit of some other party than the appellant to the action or matter so appealed, and that with the exception of the appeal so given to such other party, there shall be no appeal to the Court of Appeal from any judgment of a divisional court in appeal in any matter wherein appellate jurisdiction is given to divisional courts by sec. 75 \"except by special leave first obtained,\" &c., &c.\nIn short sub-sec 2 provides for cases in which the appellate jurisdiction of divisional courts is co-ordinate with the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, and sub-sec. 3 for cases in which the jurisdiction of divisional courts in appeal is subordinate.\nThe plaintiff in the action, however, who had so appealed to the divisional court applied to a judge of the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal to that court from the judgment of the divisional court in appeal; that learned judge refused to grant such leave for the reason that in his opinion the judgment of the divisional court in appeal was quite right and the Court of Appeal refused to interfere with such judgment of the learned judge upon the ground as is said, that the granting leave to appeal was wholly a discretionary matter and that the court would not interfere in a matter in which a learned judge had proceeded in the exercise of his discretion. In the view which I have taken as already explained, neither the learned judge to whom the application was made nor the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to grant to the plaintiff any further appeal in the case. The plaintiff now appeals to this court upon the ground, first, that the judgment of the divisional court in appeal was, under the circumstances of this case, a final judgment rendered by a court of final resort in the Province of Ontario having jurisdiction in the case within the meaning of the Revised Statutes of Canada, ch. 135, sec. 24, s.s. a, and secondly, that at any rate an appeal lies to this court under sec. 26, ss. 3 of said ch. 135.\nIn my opinion the contention of the plaintiff is well founded and an appeal lies in the present case under both of those sections, and the judgment in Danjou v. Marquis[4] does not apply to the present case which rests upon legislation subsequent to the judgment in that case.\nIt cannot be questioned that the legislature of Ontario had jurisdiction to make one court the court of final resort within the Province of Ontario in one class of cases, and another court the court of final resort in another class of cases. This is just what I think has been done by the sections of the Ontario Statutes of 1895, which are consolidated in R. S. O. of 1897, ch. 51, sections 74, 75, 76 and 77, above extracted and the judgment of the divisional court to which the plaintiff appealed from the judgment of a judge of the High Court in court was a final judgment of the highest court of final resort within the Province of Ontario in the particular case under consideration within the meaning of R. S. C. ch. 135, sec. 24, s.s. a.\nThen as to the application of sec. 26, s.s. 3, of said ch. 135, that section has never been repealed or altered and it still remains in full force and effect. The statute of the Parliament of Canada, 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 34, has no application to the present case for that; statute applies only to \"appeals from any judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario,\" and not to appeals from a judgment of a divisional court in appeal which this is. The court designated in the act by the title \"the Court of Appeal for Ontario\" is the court which has been known under that name ever since the passing of the Ontario Statute, 39 Vic. ch. 7, s. 22, which enacted that \"The Court of Error and Appeal shall hereafter be called the Court of Appeal.\" That statute therefore has no operation whatever as regards a judgment of a divisional court of the High Court and the judgment of the divisional court in the present case although pronounced in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction comes, in my judgment, within the Dominion statute, R. S. C. ch. 135, sec. 26, s.s. 3, which gives an appeal by leave of this court or a judge thereof\nfrom the final judgment of any superior court of any province other than the Province of Quebec in any action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding originally commenced in such superior court without any intermediate appeal being made to any intermediate court of appeal in the province.\nNow the judgment in the present case from which the plaintiff desires to appeal is a final judgment of the High Court of Justice in Ontario pronounced by a Divisional Court of such High Court in a suit commenced in such High Court, which is a Superior Court. The jurisdiction given by that section applies in my opinion to the present case and it is, I think, a proper case for granting leave to appeal if such be necessary for the case appears to be one of considerable importance and without expressing any opinion whatever as to the correctness or the reverse of the judgment of the Divisional Court, it will, if left to stand, deprive the plaintiff for all time in a very essential degree of the use of the stream for floating down timber thereon obstructed as it is by a dam across it, the construction and maintenance of which the judgment pronounces to be perfectly lawful and right, and that no action lies at the suit of the plaintiff whatever may be the magnitude of the loss and damage occasioned to him by the obstruction which the dam occasions to his floating timber down the stream. That is a case in which it is but reasonable I think, that the plaintiff should have leave to take the opinion of this court, and as I think sec. 26, s.s. 3 of ch. 135, R. S. C. has never been repealed or altered. I am of opinion that leave to appeal should be granted if such leave be necessary, although as I have already said, I think the plaintiff has a right to appeal to the Supreme Court under sec. 24 without special leave.\nI have gone at this length into the case, tracing all the legislation upon the subject, because the parties expressed an intention to appeal to the court from my judgment, whatever it might be, and because in cases of this kind in the nature of appeal from the judgment of the registrar, the court have expressed the opinion that the judge hearing the appeal in such case should express his own opinion instead of referring the case to the court, and so leave it to the parties to elect whether they should appeal to the court or not; The form of the order will be to discharge the order of the registrar, costs to be costs to the plaintiff in any event of the cause, and to approve the bond in appeal and to allow the appeal to the Supreme Court.\nOsier Q. C. for the respondent moved by way of appeal before the full court,\u2014(The Chief Justice and Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick and Girouard JJ.)\u2014from the order of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nAylesworth Q. C. for the appellant, contra. The court, without expressing any opinion on the main question involving the right of appeal direct from the divisional court, held that leave to appeal having been granted by Mr. Justice Gwynne the discretion exercised by him could not be reviewed and the motion was dismissed with costs.\nAfter the decision on the merits in the following term the following judgments on the question of jurisdiction were handed down.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne sitting in Chambers granting leave to appeal to the plaintiff in this action from a judgment of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Ontario immediately to this court without any intermediate appeal being had to the Court of Appeal.\nThe action was tried before the Chancellor who entered judgment for the defendants. The plaintiff appealed to the Queen's Bench Division who upon grounds distinct from those on which the first judgment had proceeded dismissed the appeal. From this judgment the plaintiff who is by an Ontario statute debarred from having recourse to an appeal to the Court of Appeal of the province sought leave to appeal under section 26, subsection 3 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, R. S. C., chapter 135. Subsection 1 of section 26 is as follows:\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Act or in the Act providing for the appeal no appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court but from the highest court of last resort having jurisdiction in the province in which the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding was originally instituted, whether the judgment or decision in such action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding was or was not a proper subject of appeal to such highest court of last resort. In the case of Danjou v. Marquis[5], which was an appeal to this court from a judgment of the Court of Review in the Province of Quebec, instituted before the original Act had been amended by the addition of the provision now contained in sub-section 3 of section 26, it was held that the words \"highest court of last resort\" were to be construed as meaning the highest Court of Appeal having jurisdiction generally in the province, and not as referring to the highest Court of Appeal in the particular case sought to be appealed; thus excluding jurisdiction in a case in which the Court of Review was by provincial legislation made the court of last resort in the province.\nThe law in this respect has since been altered as regards the Province of Quebec by the provision that appeals shall lie immediately from the Court of Review although no appeal may lie to the Court of Queen's Bench in cases where an appeal would lie against a judgment of the Court of Review directly to the Privy Council.\nAnother amendment having reference to appeals from provinces other than Quebec was contained in the following clause[6]:\nProvided also that an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court by leave of such court or a judge thereof * * * from the final judgment of any Superior Court of any province other than the Province of Quebec in any action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding originally commenced in such Superior Court without any intermediate appeal being had to any intermediate Court of Appeal in the province.\nIt is under this section and on its application to the present case that there can alone be any jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal in the present case.\nSo long as the party had a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal in the Province of Ontario it cannot be disputed that this court or a judge had jurisdiction under the preceding amendment to grant leave to a party to appeal directly to this court without resorting to an intermediate appeal to the Provincial Court of Appeal.\nBy the Ontario Act 58 Vict. cap. 13, sec. 13, subsec. 2, it was enacted:\nIn case after this Act goes into effect a party appeals to a divisional court of the High Court in a case in which an appeal lies to the Court of Appeal, the party so appealing shall not be entitled to afterwards appeal from the said divisional court to the Court of Appeal, but any other party to the action or matter may appeal to the Court of Appeal from the judgment or order of the divisional court.\nThe effect of this legislation was to make the divisional court an appellate tribunal co-ordinate in jurisdiction with the provincial court of appeal, in the cases to which the section applied, and also to make it a court of last resort in cases in which its appellate jurisdiction under this section might be exercised.\nThen the question is raised whether this had the effect of doing away with the jurisdiction of this court or a judge thereof (under the Act 38 Vict. cap. 11, sec. 11, now Supreme Court Amendment Act, sec. 26, subsec. 3, before set forth) to grant leave to appeal to this court directly from a judgment of the divisional court in a case in which owing to the change in the law by the provincial statute referred to, there could be no appeal to the Court of Appeal.\nI am clearly of opinion that this change in the procedure and jurisdiction of the provincial courts has effected no alteration in the competence of this court to exercise the powers conferred by section 26. subsec. 3 of the amended Supreme Court Act. The language of that section is just as applicable to the case of an appeal directly from a division of the provincial High Court as it ever was. It was beyond the power of the Provincial Legislature to take away any jurisdiction which Parliament had conferred on this court. The new provincial law giving an alternative right of appeal to the divisional court or to the Court of Appeal at the election of the parties, does not imply any intention on the part of the Ontario Legislature to take away a right of appeal to this court even if it had the power to do so. There is no reason why the suitor who elects to take his appeal to a divisional court should be considered as abandoning his rights of ulterior appeal to the federal jurisdiction; on the contrary it might reasonably be assumed that he ought to be in exactly the same position in that respect whichever tribunal he selected.\nThe case is therefore clearly, one in which it was competent to a judge to give leave to appeal and in the present case I am of opinion that the power was properly exercised inasmuch as the case is one of great general importance involving as it does the construction of a number of statutes relating to rivers and streams conferring rights on the public which ought to be ascertained and defined by the courts with all possible exactitude.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This appeal should be quashed. It is an appeal from the divisional court, appellant having, it is conceded, under the Ontario Statutes, ch. 51 R. S. C. 1897, sees. 74 et seq. and 62 V. (2 Sess.) ch. 11, sec. 27, no right of appeal de piano to the Court of Appeal, and leave to appeal thereto having been refused to him. Now, no appeal lies in this court from the judgment of the divisional court, except per saltum, upon special leave under subsec. 3 of sec. 26 of the Supreme Court Act (ch. 135 R S. C), which special leave can be granted however only in cases where an intermediate appeal does lie to the Court of Appeal, but where the appellant desires upon special grounds to pass over that court and come direct here. The appellant here has, it is true, obtained from a judge in chambers an order purporting to have been granted under that said subsec. 3 of sec. 26, giving him leave to appeal. But a judge in chambers had not the power to grant such leave in this case, because there being no right of appeal to the Court of Appeal, there is no per saltum at all, in allowing appellant to appeal direct from the divisional court. \"Per saltum,\u2014by a leap; passing over intermediate objects.\" Taylor's Law Glossary. The words\nwithout any intermediate appeal being had to any intermediate Court of Appeal in the province,\nat the end of that subsection mean clearly, it seems to me, that it is only the case when such an intermediate appeal lies, as in Moffatt v. The Merchants Bank[7] for instance, that the enactment is restricted to. Appellant would strike these words out of the statute. That cannot be done. The words would be entirely superfluous if an appeal to this court could be allowed when there is no appeal in the province, and we cannot so treat them.\nRespondent appealed to the court from that order granting leave to appeal, but we held that we could not entertain such appeal from the exercise of a discretionary power, assuming that the judge had jurisdiction to grant that order. The point had not been noticed in Bartram v. Village of London West[8]. See Ex parte Stevenson[9]; Re Central Bank of Canada[10], and ratio decidendi in Lane v. Esdaile[11]. Respondent should then have moved to quash the appeal; The Ontario and Quebec Railway Co. v. Marcheterre[12]. But his failure to do so cannot, of course, give us jurisdiction. In every case, we have to see, in limine, if we have power to entertain the appeal, whether the point is noticed at bar or not.\nThe appellant further contends that assuming the leave to appeal granted to him in Chambers to be of no avail, yet this court has jurisdiction because, he having no right of appeal to the Court of Appeal, the Divisional Court from which he now appeals, is, in his case, the highest court of last resort in the province under section 24, subsec. a, and section 26, subsec. 1 of the Supreme Court Act. But that contention cannot prevail. It was the contention raised in Danjou v. Marquis[13], and Macdonald v. Abbott[14], but declared unfounded by the court.\nIn Quebec, a party who is dissatisfied with the judgment of the Superior Court may either appeal to the Court of Review or to the Court of Appeal, but if he elects to appeal to the\" Court of Review, and the judgment is confirmed, he has no right to appeal further to the Court of Appeal. Though in such a case, the Court of Review was the court of final resort in the province, yet we held in those cases that no appeal could then be taken therefrom to this court, as that court was not the highest court of final resort in the, province. Now, the divisional court is likewise not the highest court of final resort established in the Province of Ontario. See also Chevalier v. Curillier[15]. By an amending Act, 54 & 55, V. c. 25 (D), an appeal now lies from the Quebec Court of Review in certain cases, but until a similar legislation is extended to the divisional court of Ontario, no appeal lies from that court. No subsequent legislation to the cases I have referred to has altered the Supreme Court Act in that respect. In fact, Danjou v. Marquis[16], is re-asserted as law, but for the amending Act above cited, as late as 1895 in Barrington v. The City of Montreal[17].\nThe contention that the Ontario Legislature could not indirectly do what it cannot do directly, take away the right of appeal to this court, has been answered in City of Ste. Cunegonde v. Gougeon[18], where the learned Chief Justice said for the court.\nThat the Provincial Legislature may limit appeals to the Court of Appeal of the province must be admitted, although the effect of so doing may be to take away in such cases a further appeal to the Supreme Court.\nThe appellant would contend that though by the Dominion Act, 60 & 61 Y. c. 34, no appeal, with certain exceptions, lies to the Supreme Court from any judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the amount in controversy in appeal does not exceed one thousand dollars, yet an appeal would lie from the Divisional Court where by the Ontario statute the judgment of that court is final, even when the amount in controversy is less than one thousand dollars. Such an anomaly was not intended. Parliament of Canada, must have assumed that no appeal lies from Ontario in ordinary cases, but from the Court of Appeal, the highest court of final resort in the province. The Ontario Legislature likewise, since 1881, by ch. 49, R. S. O. (1897) sec. 2, has assumed that to be the law. And though, prior to the recent legislation on the subject, the divisional court's judgment by the Act of 1881 was final in cases under $500, where the judgment was unanimous, yet, I do not know of a single attempt during that period to bring any of those cases to the Supreme Court, though, if appellant's contention here prevailed, all of them would have been appealable. That is not, per se, conclusive, but it shows the novelty of the present appeal The consensus of the profession and of the Federal and Provincial Legislative authorities deserves consideration.\nThe order granted in Chambers as to this second point cannot give us jurisdiction. If the appeal direct was given by the statute, no order would be necessary. If it is not given by the statute, no order can give it. The case, on this point, is precisely as it the registrar had received the appeal de piano. The question of jurisdiction would still then be open to the respondent, with or without motion to quash, and, would have, upon his failure to do so, to be taken by the court.\nGWYNNE J. took no part in the judgment on the appeal from his order in chambers.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of my brother Taschereau.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I concur in the dismissal of this appeal from the order made in chambers.\nIn the following term the case was heard on the merits before a differently constituted court, Mr. Justice King being present, and Mr. Justice Sedgewick not sitting.\nAylesworth Q C. and Shaunessy for the appellant, referred to Little v. Ince[19].\nOsier Q.C. for the respondent, The only remedy given by the Act is that of removing the obstruction, and no other is open to appellant. Hardcastle on Statutes, 2 ed. pp. 259-261. Lamplugh v. Norton[20]; Cockburn v. Imperial Lumber Co.[21]. The judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The appeal before us is from a judgment of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario, dismissing an appeal of the plaintiff from the judgment of the trial judge dismissing his action, the short material substance of which as set out in his statement of claim was a complaint that he being a person engaged in the business of floating logs of timber down a stream called Bear Creek during the season of freshets suffered damage from certain logs of his which during the freshet seasons of the years 1895, 1896 and 1897 he was floating down the stream having been obstructed and delayed by two several obstructions which the plaintiff alleges had been made by the defendants across the stream and were used by them for the purpose of damming up the water of the said stream so as to hold the same during the dry season of the year when little water was in the stream, and from which since the construction of the obstructions the plaintiff alleges that the defendants have drawn and still do draw the water by a large iron pipe to an oil refinery which they operate several miles away.\nThis judgment of the Divisional Court appears to me to have proceeded upon a too limited and too technical construction of the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim. The court in pronouncing their judgment say:\nThe plaintiff does not put his case upon the ground that the defendants having the right to construct the dams in question negligently constructed them, nor alleging that there was a duty upon them to construct the said dams with aprons or slides therein on the ground of the neglect of such duty, but he puts it solely upon the ground that the defendants although not riparian proprietors or in anywise entitled to any right, property or interest in the said stream or creek apart from other members of the public wrongfully erected the said dams. Woodley was undoubtly the owner of the land on each side of the creek, and prim\u00e2 facie the owner of the soil which formed the bed of the creek at the point at which he constructed his dam, and as such owner had as we have seen the right to construct the said dam. At the point at which the defendants constructed their dam one Fairbanks owned the land on the west side of the creek and the soil which formed the bed of the creek to the centre of the creek, and Fitzgerald and Fellows together owned the land on the east side of the creek and prim\u00e2 facie the soil which formed the bed of the creek to the centre of the creek so that at this point Fairbanks, Fitzgerald and Fellows together owned the land on each side of the creek and were prim\u00e2 facie owners of the soil which formed the bed of the creek, and it was under their leave, license and authority that the defendants constructed their dam, and they had therefore the right to do so.\nIf this was the proper construction to put upon the statement of claim, then instead of dismissing the plaintiff's appeal upon the ground stated the proper course to have been pursued would have been for the court to have exercised the powers vested in the Ontario courts by statute, and which they are not only authorized but required to exercise at any stage of the action and not only upon, but without the application of any of the parties, and to have made all such amendments as might be necessary to determine the rights and interests of the respective parties, and the real question in controversy between them, and which was in point of fact brought to trial and tried, and best calculated to secure the giving of judgment according to the very right and justice of the case; but the sentence in the statement of claim from which the Divisional Court have extracted a part continues to express clearly enough, as it appears to me, that the gist of the plaintiff's statement of claim, as alleged in the 4th paragraph, and the wrongfulness therein complained of consisted in the defendant having erected\ntwo certain obstructions in said stream, one being about three fourths of a mile further up the stream than the other by laying timber, stones, stakes, earth and other substances firmly jointed and very difficult of removal across the full width of the said stream at those two points, of a sufficient height to intercept the flow of the water in the stream even in high water, and to catch and obstruct saw-logs and timber floating down the stream.\nThen the statement of claim in its 5th, 6th and 7th paragraphs proceeds to allege the repeated obstructions of the plaintiffs caused by these obstructions in the years 1895, 1896 and 1897, and the difficulty he had in getting the logs freed from the jams thereby caused and the damage occasioned him thereby. Then in the 8th paragraph was inserted another cause of action to which the language cited from the statement of claim by the Divisional Court as to the defendants \"although not riparian proprietors,\" &c., &c., seems to relate; that cause of action is thus stated in paragraph 8.\nThe plaintiff is a riparian proprietor on the said stream below the said obstructions, and he has suffered and is suffering great damages by the withdrawal of the said water from the said stream by said defendants by reason of loss of water for cattle and other domestic purposes.\nNow that the defendants never had any doubt that the gist of the plaintiffs complaint, as alleged in the first seven paragraphs of the statement of claim, consisted in the damage alleged to have been suffered by him by reason of his logs having been wrongfully impeded and jammed together in coming down the streams by two obstructions alleged to have been constructed by the defendants across the stream of a character capable of impeding, and which did impede plaintiff's logs floating down the stream without having any slide therein whereby the logs could descend the obstructions or dams, appears by the defendants statement of defence, and by the evidence and course of proceedings at the trial. The defendants in their statement of defence:\u20141. Plead a general denial of all the allegations in the statement of claim except those in the 1st paragraph. 2. They deny that the said obstructions ever prevented the passage or ever caused the logs or timber of the plaintiff to become jammed as alleged.\n3. The obstruction referred to in the statement of claim did not catch and obstruct the said logs and timber of the plaintiff floating down said stream as alleged, but on the contrary the said obstructions, if any, raised the water of the stream above them, thereby rendering it more convenient and possible at certain times, when otherwise it would have been impossible, to float logs and timber on the shallow parts of said stream above said obstructions.\n4. That if any such obstructions existed as alleged, (which the defendants do not admit but deny) the plaintiff was well aware thereof before putting his logs and timber in the stream as alleged and the plaintiff could, as he lawfully might with little or no expense, have removed the said obstructions complained of and have thereby avoided the jams that he alleges (but which the defendants deny) occurred.\n5. The right claimed of by the plaintiff in respect of the use of the said stream for floating logs and timber, (and which right the defendants deny) is, if any, a statutory right acquired under ch. 120 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, and the defendants plead and claim the benefit of sections 5 and 6 of said Act.\nThen as to the cause of action in the 8th paragraph of the statement of claim the defendants pleaded a defence covering also the allegation in the 4th paragraph that the defendants \"although not riparian proprietors,\" &c., &c., did the act complained of for the purpose of drawing off water, &c., &c., to their oil refinery in which defence they say:\n6. That they are and have been during all the times complained of, lessees and in possession of a part of lot number fourteen in the twelfth concession of the Township of Enniskillen, now in the town of Petrolia, abutting on the said stream, and as such are and have been during said times entitled to the rights of riparian proprietors, and that if they withdrew any water from the said stream to be used in their said manufactory as alleged (which, however, they do not admit) the same was a reasonable use of the said stream and did not cause any damage to the plaintiff as alleged, and the said water, if any was taken, was returned to the said stream by the defendants above the lands of which the plaintiff claims to be a riparian proprietor. Issue having been joined on these defences the parties went down to trial and there the main contention was as to the amount of damage, if any, sustained by the plaintiff by reason of his logs having been interrupted and delayed in their progress by the obstructions complained of. In the course of the inquiry into this matter it appeared in evidence that the upper dam was constructed by one Woodley upon his own property, and the learned trial judge held that although it appeared that the defendants assisted in the construction thereof by giving some material therefor, and although they derived a benefit from the dam by arrangement with Woodley to have a pipe in the dam enabling them to draw off water to their oil refinery, still, that Woodley was the only person who, if any, was responsible to the plaintiff for any damage by him sustained by reason of his logs having been obstructed by that dam, and he held as a matter of fact upon the evidence before him that the plaintiff had not sustained any damage which was attributable to the lower dam which was built by the defendants and for the above reasons he gave judgment dismissing the plaintiff's action. He pronounced no judgment upon the defence raised by the 5th paragraph of the statement of defence, the contention of the parties in respect of which was\u2014on the part of the plaintiff\u2014that all persons who hinder or delay the floating of logs down a stream by the erection therein of any dam or other obstruction are responsible to the person suffering damage from his logs being thereby obstructed unless they show that they had erected a sufficient slide to enable the logs to float over the dam and so float down the stream, and the contention of the defendants being that the right of riparian proprietors to construct a dam across a river is absolute subject only to the right of persons floating logs down the river to construct at their own cost a sufficient slide in such dam. As the Divisional Court although not adjudicating upon this point have expressed an opinion upon the question involved in this paragraph of the defence, and as the question is a very important one, it is necessary to deal with it under the defence contained in the 5th paragraph of the statement of defence. The question is certainly one of some apparent difficulty which arises from the manner in which divers Acts and sections of Acts of Parliament are re-enacted in divers sections of one chapter of the edition of the statutes\u2014called the Revised Statutes of Ontario. Thus, the first section of ch. 120 R. S. O., 1887, is the consolidation of the first section of 4? Vict. ch. 17, passed in 1884, and secs. 11 to 22, both inclusive, of the said ch. 120, are severally and continuously the consolidation of secs. 2 to 13, both inclusively, severally and in continuous order of the said ch. 17 of 47 Vict., while secs. 2 to 10, both inclusively of said ch. 120, are severally the consolidation of sections of like numbers in ch. 115 R. S. O., 1877, and this ch. 115 is in like manner the consolidation of certain parts of two other Acts, namely, chs. 47 and 48 C. S. U. C. which are in like manner the consolidation of other previous Acts, but it is unnecessary for my purpose to go farther back than C. S. U. C. The first and second sections of said ch. 115 are respectively the consolidation of secs. 15 and 16 of ch. 48, C. S. U. C. in-titled \"An Act respecting mills and mill dams,\" while secs. 3 to 8, both inclusive of said ch. 115, are respectively the consolidation of secs. 1 to 6, both inclusively, and in continuous order of ch. 47 C. S. U. O.\nNow every edition of the Revised Statutes of Ontario is subjected to an Act of the Legislature, intituled \"An Act respecting the Revised Statutes of Ontario,\" prescribing the manner in which the revised statutes shall be construed, and enacting\nthat the said revised statutes shall not be held to operate as new law, but shall be construed, and have effect as, a consolidation and as declaratory of the law as contained in the said Acts or parts of Acts so repealed, and for which the said revised statutes are substituted.\nIn accordance with this direction sec. 5 of ch. 120 R. S. O. 1887 cannot be construed as anything more than a section in consolidation of sec. 5 of said ch. 115 R. S. O. 1877, and as declaratory merely of the law as contained in such last mentioned section now repealed, and that the said section 5 of said ch. 115 was while in force in like manner a consolidation merely of sec. 3 of ch. 47 C. S. U. C. For the purpose therefore of construing sec. 5 of the R. S. O. 1887, ch. 120, it is necessary to refer back to this ch. 47 C. S. U C, and to determine the purport and intent of the sec 3 thereof. This ch. 47 C. S. U. C. imposed in its first section penalties upon persons who should, except as therein authorised, fell any trees into certain large navigable rivers therein mentioned, and in its second section imposed penalties on all persons who should throw into any river, rivulet or water course, \"excepting those hereinafter mentioned\" any substance therein mentioned, or should fell or cause to be felled in or across such river, rivulet or water course any timber or growing or standing trees, and should suffer them to remain in or across such river, rivulet or water course.\nThen sec. 3 enacts as follows:\nThis Act shall not apply to any dam, weir or bridge erected in or over any such river, rivulet or water course, &c., &c.\nAnd sec. 4 names the rivers excepted from such section 2 of the Act under the words \"excepting these hereinafter mentioned,\" namely: The Rivers St. Lawrence and Ottawa, and all rivers or rivulets \"wherein salmon, pickerel, black bass or perch do not abound.\"\nIt appears therefore to be clear that sec. 5 of the ch. 120 cannot be read as new law or as anything else than a qualification of the penal clauses 3 and 4 which are but the consolidation of the penal clauses in ch. 47 C. S. U. C. It cannot therefore be construed as having any effect in qualification of sec. I of ch. 120, which is a consolidation of sec. 1 of 47 Vict. ch. 17. Indeed so to construe it would be to contradict in most plain terms that section which declares that it is and always has been the right of all persons during spring and autumn freshets to float logs, timber, &c., &c., down all rivers, creeks and streams, and that no person shall by felling trees or placing any other obstruction in or across any such river, creek or stream prevent the passage thereof, and in case of any such obstruction being caused it is declared to have been always lawful for the persons floating logs, &c., down the stream to remove the obstruction if necessary, and to construct such apron, slide, &c., &c., &c., or other work necessary for the purpose aforesaid that is, for removal of the obstruction. Now there can be no doubt that in order to construct an apron or slide for the purpose of removing the obstruction caused to floating timber it is plain that such works must needs be constructed for the purpose of removing the obstruction caused by a dam across the whole width of a stream. There can be no pretence therefore for saying that a dam across a river which obstructs the floating of logs, &c., &c., is not an obstruction within the first section of ch. 120, B. S. O., 1887. As all persons have a legal right to float logs, &c., &c., down every river or stream in Ontario the obstruction of that legal right is necessarily a wrong and gives a good cause of action for recovery of damages for the injury sustained thereby, but the statute gives a further remedy which enables the party suffering the injury to abate the nuisance by removal of the obstruction subject to this qualification that if the obstruction be a dam across a river which may be lawfully constructed for many useful and lawful purposes the person requiring to use the river for floating down logs therein may not remove the dam if it have an apron or sluice in it sufficient to enable the logs, &c., to float down; the remedy by removal of the obstruction can only serve to prevent a recurrence of the injury\u2014an action affords the only remedy for an injury suffered from the obstruction prior to its removal.\nThe question before us must then turn upon the judgment of the trial judge and we think that the evidence sufficiently established such a connection of the defendants in the erection of the upper dam and in its maintenance, that they are answerable in an action at the suit of the plaintiff for any damages caused by the obstruction to his floating his logs.\nWe think that the appeal must be allowed with costs and that the whole question of the damage whether caused by the upper or the Lower obstruction should be referred to the master of the High Court of Ontario to inquire and report to the court. The appellant will have the costs of this appeal and of his appeal to the Divisional Court and the costs of the action up to and inclusive of the trial; subsequent costs must be reserved until after the master's report.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Pardee & Shaunessy.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Moncrieff & Gausby.\n[1] 29 O.

On cross-examination the witness was questioned as to the disposition of the proceeds of debentures and on re-examination plaintiff's counsel interrogated him at length as to the selling price of the stock on the Montreal Exchange, and proved that they sold at about 50 per cent premium. The judge in charging the jury directed them to assess the damages as \"upon the extent of the injury plaintiff received independent of what these people may be, or whether they are rich or poor.\" The plaintiff obtained a verdict with heavy damages.\nHeld, that on cross-examination of the witness by defendant's counsel the door was not open for re-examination as to the selling price of the stock; that in view of the amount of the verdict it was quite likely that the general observation of the judge in his charge did not remove its effect on the jury as to the financial ability of the company to respond well in damages.\nThe injury for which plaintiff sued was his foot being crushed, and on the day of the accident the medical staff of the hospital where he had been taken held a consultation and were divided as to the necessity for amputation. Dr. W., who thought the limb might be saved, was, four days later, appointed by the company, at the suggestion of plaintiff's attorney, to co-operate with plaintiff's physician. Eventually the foot was amputated and plaintiff made a good recovery. On the trial plaintiff's physician swore to a conversation with Dr. W. four days after the first consultation, and three days before the amputation, when Dr. W. stated that if he could induce plaintiff's attorney to view it from a surgeon's standpoint, and not use it to work on the sympathies of the jury he might consider more fully the question of amputation. The judge in his charge referred to this conversation and told the jury that it seemed to him very important if Dr. W. was using his position as one of the hospital staff to keep the limb on when it should have been taken off, and that he thought it very reprehensible.\nHeld, Strong C.J. and Gwynne J. dissenting, that as Dr. W. did not represent the company at the first consultation when he opposed amputation; as others of the staff took the same view and there was no proof that amputation was delayed through his instrumentality; and as the jury would certainly consider the judge's remarks as bearing on the contention made on plaintiff's behalf that amputation should have taken place on the very day of the accident, it must have affected the amount of the verdict.\nTo tell a jury to ask themselves \"If I were plaintiff how much ought I to be paid if the company did me an injury?\" is not a proper direction.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick setting aside a verdict for the plaintiff and ordering a new trial.\nThe action in this case was for damages as compensation for personal injuries to the plaintiff', caused as was alleged, by negligence of servants of the defendant company. The plaintiff recovered a verdict with $25,000 damages, and a new trial was moved for on grounds of misdirection and improper reception and rejection of evidence. The Supreme Court of New Brunswick granted a new trial, and plaintiff appealed to this court. The material grounds of objection to the proceedings on the trial are stated in the judgments given on this appeal.\nQuigley Q.C. (Stockton Q.C. with him) for the appellant.\nPugsley Q.C. and McLean Q.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I dissent from the judgment of the court for the reasons given in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne, in which I concur in all respects.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014After a protracted and much contested trial of fourteen days continuance during which the defendants disputed all liability and no less than thirty-eight witnesses were examined the jury, said to have been a special jury and a most intelligent one, unanimously rendered a verdict for the plaintiff with twenty-five thousand dollars damages. The defendants moved to set aside this verdict upon seventy-five separate items of objection stated in their motion paper of which forty were objections of alleged improper reception of evidence, eleven of alleged improper rejection of evidence, twenty-two for alleged misdirection then for excessive damages, and finally upon alleged discovery of new evidence.\nUpon one only of these several grounds of objection did a majority of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick concur in granting a new trial. That ground was one of those for alleged misdirection which did not however at all affect the liability of the defendants for the occurrence of the injury, but was pointed solely to the amount of damages which had been rendered by the jury which were contended to be excessive. The objection relates to the observations of the learned judge in his charge to the jury in relation to certain evidence given by a Dr. Broderick, a surgeon employed by the plaintiff to attend him upon his receiving the injury which is the subject of this action. The matter testified by Dr. Broderick came out as part of the narrative of the disaster which had befallen the plaintiff, of the nature of his injury, his sufferings and their continuance until his foot was amputated, and so the evidence given constituted matter which, as part of the narrative of the disaster, could not have been withheld from the jury, and assuming the evidence so given to have been true, in the opinion of the jury, no reasonable objection can, I think, be taken to the observations made by the learned trial judge in relation to it.\nThe matter arose in this way. The plaintiff upon the occurrence of the injury received by him placed himself in the hands of Dr. Broderick. He had however to be taken for treatment to the general hospital at St. John where, as was said, only five or six medical men were permitted as surgeons or physicians to attend a patient. Dr. Broderick was not one of these but the defendants had retained one of the hospital surgeons, Dr. Thos D. Walker, jr., to consult with Dr. Broderick as to the treatment of the plaintiff. Dr. Broderick for reasons which he gave was of opinion that, and urged that, the foot should be amputated. Although not permitted to take part in the treatment in the hospital he was permitted to see the plaintiff as a friend or visitor, and he was present in the hospital when the hospital surgeons put the plaintiff's foot in plaster, and his testimony was that upon leaving the hospital upon that occasion with Dr. Thos. D. Walker whom he knew had been retained by the defendants to consult with him he, Dr. Broderick, in conversation with Dr. Walker upon the plaintiff's case remarked that in his opinion it would be best that the foot should be taken off and that Dr. Walker replied that if Dr. Quigley (the plaintiff's attorney in the matter)\ndid not use it to work on the sympathies of the jury and would look at it from the standpoint of a surgeon, that it might probably be arranged that the foot might be taken off earlier\u2014that that could be arranged between them.\nNow the defendant's counsel in the motion paper for a new trial without stating what were the observations of the learned judge to which the objection of misdirection is taken, in one paragraph of the motion paper put a construction upon the judge's observations which, assuming that construction to be correct, is one which is put forward by the defendants themselves as affecting Dr. Walker if the evidence of Dr. Broderick was to be adopted as true, but not in any manner as affecting the plaintiffs right to a verdict, or the amount of damages recoverable by him so as to constitute good ground for a new trial being granted for misdirection. In the motion paper for a new trial it is not suggested that, nor in my opinion is there any foundation for the suggestion in argument that, the learned trial judge's observations on this head had a tendency to induce the jury to increase the amount of damages for which they should render a verdict against the defendants. The learned trial judge in his judgment upon the motion for a new trial has, with reason, in my opinion, repudiated any such construction being put upon his charge, and indeed no such construction can, I think be put upon it without eliminating more than half of the charge for in a very plain manner as I think did the learned judge expressly draw the attention of the jury to the evidence which he submitted to them as that upon which they should render the verdict both as to liability and as to amount of damages if liable, and in such evidence, the reference to which occupies more than half of the learned judge's charge, there is not a syllable which relates to Dr. Broderick's evidence, while the whole contention of the defendant is laid before the jury in a clear and exhaustive manner. The gravamen however of this charge is stated in paragraph \"M\" of the motion paper as follows:\nIn telling the jury that Dr. Walker did not contradict Dr. Broderick, he only says that he did not remember making statements whereas the evidence shows that Dr. Walker not only says that he has no recollection of having made such a statement but did not think that he had done so.\nNow Dr. Walker having been called as a witness by the defendant, was asked if he had heard what Dr. Broderick had said took place in conversation between them and, having said he had, he was asked if Dr. Broderick had stated that conversation correctly as he, witness, remembered it, to which he replied that he had no recollection of mentioning anything about damages or about Dr. Quigley. Then on cross-examination, he was asked if Dr. Broderick had said that he thought it better to take off the foot, to which he answered that he thought he did. Then the words used by Dr. Broderick in his evidence having been repeated to him he was asked if he would swear that he did not use those words to which he replied \"I won't swear it but I do not think I did, \"I won't swear I didn't,\" and he repeated several times that he did not think he did but he would not swear that he did not. Upon re-examination the defendant's counsel put to him this rather leading question:\nDid such a thought as that ever occur to your mind? To which he answered:\u2014\"No,\nand further said that notwithstanding what he had said in his examination, he had no recollection of having made such a statement, and that he did not think he had made it. Now the learned judge in the course of his narrative of the plaintiff's injury, and his suffering, spoke of the evidence given by Dr. Broderick as not having been denied by Dr. Walker, but that he said he did not remember having said what Dr. Broderick said that he had said. This I must say does not appear to me to be what can be called an inaccurate summary of what Dr. Walker had said. If however the learned counsel for the defendant thought otherwise, and also thought that it was a point which it was material to the defendant should be corrected, the course open to him was plainly to have called the attention of the judge at the time to the matter so that it might have been corrected instead of keeping silent and taking the chance of a verdict in favour of the defendant, and if it should be against them, moving on such an objection for a new trial for misdirection. The ordinary rule in England is not to entertain a motion for misdirection upon a ground not drawn to the attention of the trial judge. This is said not to be the practice in New Brunswick, while that the law of England is the law of New Brunswick upon the subject is not denied; but the statute 60 Vict. ch. 25 of New Brunswick, sec. 370, does enact that a new trial shall not be granted on the ground of misdirection, or of the improper admission or rejection of evidence unless in the opinion of the court some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned in the trial of the action, and no such wrong or miscarriage can be said to have been occasioned in that trial of the action by anything involved in the objection upon which alone the majority of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick have proceeded: Indeed as already observed, the objection is in the motion paper rested upon this that the learned judge's alleged misstatement of Dr. Walker's evidence injuriously affected him, not that it occasioned any wrong or miscarriage in the trial of that action.\nCounsel for the respondents pressed before us two of the seventy-five objections which did not in the opinion of a majority of the Supreme Court warrant the setting aside of the verdict, but in neither of these cases can it in my opinion be said that the observations of the learned judge which are objected to have occasioned any wrong or miscarriage whatever in the trial of the action. First as to that which arose on the examination of the witness Robinson. In his examination of that witness it cannot, I think, for a moment be supposed that the plaintiff's experienced counsel, the late Judge Palmer, had any idea of eliciting from the witness statements which had been made to him by others which the learned counsel contemplated should be taken as evidence of the truth of such statements; his object was, I think, to give to the witness, who as president of the company had gone to the States for the purpose of obtaining evidence to test the correctness of the statements of the plaintiff in his claim for compensation, an opportunity of saying whether he had learned anything contradictory of such statements as presented to the defendant. The learned counsel, I think, felt that if the president had answered the questions he was proposing to put to him he must have said that he had heard nothing prejudicial to the plaintiff's claim. He would then possibly have asked why then the action was so persistently resisted. The learned judge said that the witness having thus been given this opportunity of telling what, if anything, he had heard prejudicial to the plaintiff's statement and having through his counsel objected to answer the jury might, when considering the value of the plaintiff's evidence, infer that if the president of the defendant company could have said that he had learned anything contradictory of the plaintiff's statement he would have availed himself of the opportunity given him to do so. It must be admitted that these observations were quite unnecessary for the plaintiff had Mr. Eccles in court and divers others, all of whom were called as witnesses and spoke as to the plaintiff's professional standing, his present means before the injury, and but for the injury his future prospects, all of which evidence was submitted to the jury from which they had the fullest opportunity of setting their value upon the plaintiff's evidence which was the sole point to which the judge's remarks which were objected to related without any reference to the inference which it was suggested might be drawn from the interruption of the examination of the president of the company; but however unnecessary the remarks of the learned judge may be said to have been upon this head of objection it cannot, in view of the evidence of Eccles and others upon the point in question, be said that the remarks objected to upon this head occasioned any wrong or miscarriage whatever in the trial of the action. Then upon the head of objections as to what the learned judge said as to the commission. The form of that objection for misdirection is\nin telling the jury that the defendant company were bound to have had the commission returned and that the fact that the commission had not been returned was a matter which they could take into consideration when pronouncing upon the credibility of the plaintiff.\nI cannot see here any ground for an objection for misdirection. The observations which are objected to point only to the value to be attached to the plaintiff's evidence, for his credibility is not assailed in the only manner known to the law, and as to setting a proper value upon his evidence there was most abundant evidence given by Eccles and other witnesses. The utmost that can be said is that the remarks involved in this objection were unnecessary, and it cannot be said that the learned judge's remarks on this head can have occasioned any wrong or miscarriage on the trial of the action. In the argument before us, although no point founded upon the contention was taken in any of the 75 objections on the motion paper, it was pressed upon us, although it had appeared that the commission was withheld by the commissioner and not returned by the express order of the defendants given through their solicitor, and although the defendants persistently contended that the plaintiff was not entitled to see the commission, yet that they had subsequently at the trial offered that either party might put in whatever minutes they severally had of the evidence given which they might choose to put in, an offer not accepted by the plaintiff. What was intended by the passing of this offer does not appear very plain. Whether it should be taken as a condonation of the offence committed in ordering the commission to be withheld in contempt of the order of the court or otherwise it is difficult to say. It is sufficient, however, I think, to say that the only objection on this head which we have to consider is that as framed in the motion paper for the new trial as above stated, and, so considered, the remarks of the learned judge cannot be said to constitute misdirection, and even if they could can not be said to have occasioned any wrong or miscarriage in the trial of the action.\nNow all the objections taken as affecting the liability of the defendant for the injury which the plaintiff suffered are dropped at the last moment in the argument before us in which the contention that the defendant is not so liable has been no longer contended, and for the reasons already stated all the objections as of misdirection as affecting the amount of damages must, i think, fail. All that remains, therefore, is the naked objection that the damages are excessive. It may be admitted that in this country it is not a usual thing for verdicts for $25,000 damages to be rendered in an action of this nature, but neither is it a usual occurrence for the loss of a foot to occasion such excessive injury as that occasioned to the plaintiff, and which I think the evidence shows to have been of the very gravest possible character, destructive of his sole means of practising his profession as an organist, and of supporting himself and his family. Under these circumstances I do not feel justified in saying that this jury, the constitutional tribunal for awarding damages in actions of this nature, have erred in awarding to the plaintiff for the injury he has received the sum of $25,000, large as that sum may appear to be. That was a matter solely for the consideration of the jury which was a special one, and said to have consisted of most competent and intelligent persons. I am of opinion, therefore, that the appeal should be allowed with costs, and that judgment should be entered for the plaintiff, in the action, upon the jury's verdict with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice King.\nKING J.\u2014None of the objections to the admission or rejection of evidence require to be considered except one, viz.: that as to the shares of the company selling at a premium.\nThis occurred in the testimony of Mr. J. Morris Robinson, the vice-president of the company, who was called on behalf of the plaintiff. The evidence in itself was improper, but it is contended that the matter had first been gone into by the defendants on the cross-examination of Mr. Robinson. What took place was this: Mr. Palmer, counsel for plaintiff, questioned Mr. Robinson as to the equipment of the road and then asked:\nQ. You know, I suppose, that the company put aut some $400,000 of bonds. Did they not?\nA. Yes. $500,000 or $450,000.\nQ. And also $500,000 of stocks?\nA. Yes.\nMr. Quigley in opening to the jury had said:\nIt is a matter of common knowledge that these defendants are making and were making at this time and are to-day making large sums of money out of the building and equipping of this road. This fact you can see because they have formed a company and issued a large amount of stock, but the investment is such a profitable one that the stock rose to the value of $145 for every $100; in other words really 50 per cent more. If meanwhile they have been converting these cars into death traps for young and old riding upon them, each one of us is equal to the realizing the sense of the outrage which has been committed against each one using the tram cars in this city.\nThen the counsel for the defendants, when it came to the cross-examination, attempted to show that the proceeds of this large issue of bonds and stock had gone into the equipment of the road, but in this he wholly failed, and ended in proving what probably he would have preferred not to prove, viz.: that it had been divided up amongst the shareholders of the amalgamating companies according to a scheme agreed upon before the amalgamation.\nQ. My learned friend Mr. Palmer asked you if this company had not issued stock and debentures to the amount which he named, and my learned friend, Dr. Quigley yesterday, in what I think may be the same connection, told the jury that the company made a large amount of money out of the stock and debentures. Is that true 1\nA. The stock is selling at quite a premium\u2014\u2014\u2014\nQ. He said that the company made an amount out of the issue?\nA. That is not within my knowledge. Q. Is it not a fact that the proceeds of the debentures went into the new road and the erection of the power house and thorough equipment of it?\nA. No; that is not the case.\nQ. I do not say all of it, but\u2014\u2014\u2014\nA. No, none of it. It was an amalgamation of two companies, and on the amalgamation certain stock and bonds were issued and divided among the shareholders according to the proportion agreed upon.\nThe original notes of the official stenographer and the printed case show, by a dash after the word \"premium\" that Mr. Robinson's answer to the first question was interrupted by counsel who, in another question, put before the sentence was completed, repeated in shorter form the question he had put before. Clearly, Mr. Robinson's unfinished answer was not responsive to the question, and, by interrupting him before he finished the sentence and drawing his mind to the real question, it is made sufficiently clear that the defendant's counsel was not accepting it as an answer to his question. The plaintiff's counsel would clearly not have been entitled to require that Mr. Robinson should be permitted to finish the sentence he had begun.\nUpon re-examination the plaintiff's counsel drew attention to this answer, and went on at length into the matter of the selling price of the shares on the stock market at Montreal, proving that they had sold at 145 or 150. This evidence was objected to. I agree with Tuck C. J. that the door was not opened for such re-examination by the cross-examination of defendant's counsel, and the evidence must be considered as calculated to work substantial injury to defendants on the question of damages. The only real question remaining in reference to it is whether its natural effect was not neutralised by the observations of the learned trial judge in instructing the jury that the damages were to be assessed upon the extent of the injury plaintiff received, independent of what these people may be or whether they are poor or rich.\nUnder the practice Act of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, 60 Vict. c. 24, sec. 370,\na new trial is not to be granted on the ground of misdirection or of the improper admission or rejection of evidence * * * unless in the opinion of the court some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned in the trial of the action.\nIn Mayne on Damages, at p. 405, it is remarked that although juries are frequently cautioned not to let their verdict be influenced by the poverty of the plaintiff and the wealth of the defendant, yet the caution is probably seldom much attended to.\nIn view of the amount of the verdict in this case it is quite likely that the general observation of the learned judge did not remove the effect of the improper evidence as to the financial ability of the company to respond well in damages.\nNext as to grounds of alleged misdirection:\n(1) As to the inference to be drawn from the defendant's objection to Mr. Robinson's stating what he was told in Providence by a Mr. Eccles regarding plaintiff's standing, earning capacity, etc:\u2014About the time of action brought, the plaintiff's attorney informed Mr. Robinson (the vice-president of the company at St. John) that they could learn of the plaintiff's character and standing in his profession, etc., by inquiry at Providence, indicating several sources of information. Mr. Robinson went to Providence and made inquiries (amongst others) of a Mr. Eccles, who was not however, one of those indicated by plaintiff. Mr. Robinson called on behalf of the plaintiff, testified on direct examination that he had been recommended by a Mr. Torrance to Mr. Eccles, and that he had asked the latter as to plaintiff's standing as a musician, and as to his ability to earn money as an organist. He was then asked by plaintiff's counsel: \"What information did you get\" i.e. from Mr. Eccles. On objection by defendant's counsel the question was disallowed, and I think properly, because it was mere hearsay, and could not possibly be held to be evidence in support of plaintiff's case. If plaintiff had mentioned Eccles as a person from whom information might besought as to him, it might make Eccles's statements to Mr. Robinson evidence against himself, but it is quite a different thing when he seeks the benefit of the unsworn statements and opinions of third persons.\nWhen the learned judge came to charge the jury he said:\nAs I said a moment ago that the onus is upon the plaintiff to make out what he earned, but at the same time, while that is true, you have also had it in evidence that these defendants were put in a position to make the fullest inquiry as to the man's circumstances, where he was living, his social status, and his professional status, and all that. You have the evidence of Mr. Robinson that he went to Providence, that he was recommended to Mr. Eccles as a man who could give the proper information, that he had an interview with him. He comes back, and while the information he received would not be evidence, if objected to, still you may fairly consider this, that when Mr. Robinson is given an opportunity to tell all that, it was objected to and was necessarily ruled out; but when you come to consider Mr. Hesse's evidence, may you not assume that if he (i.e. Mr. Robinson), heard anything unfavourable, would he not have told it? It is for you to consider this, and you can consider this as to the weight to be given to or attached to Hesse's evidence, and it is for you to consider all this when you come to pronounce on the credibility of the witness, and it is not amiss for you to look at the surrounding circumstances and those things, and from them receive what assistance you can in determining how far you can accept his statement. I think it is material at which you can look when you are considering his earning capacity.\nThe learned judge can scarcely have well considered his words. If the unsworn statements of Mr. Eccles to Mr. Robinson were not admissible as against defendant, the objection to such improper evidence cannot prejudice the case, or help out that of the plaintiff, by inferences favourable to his credibility or in any other way. How can A's credibility be supported by the proper rejection of B's improper testimony? It would be quite a different thing to say that failure by defendant to produce available evidence would tend to give credit to the testimony of one who was giving an account of occurrences which, if an incorrect account, could be readily shown to be so by such other proof not adduced.\nWhile I have no doubt of the error, I am doubtful as to how far it can have affected the result prejudicially, and this for this reason:\nMr. Eccles was himself a witness on the trial, called on behalf of the plaintiff, and while his statement made in Providence to Mr. Robinson was inadmissible, the jury were in possession of his testimony on the trial, and to the extent that it went, it was much in favour of the plaintiff, and the jury might very well have found the same support in Eccles's testimony, as they were told they might find by an inference drawn from defendant's exclusion of his unsworn statements in Providence. The two things are not entirely equivalent, but there is so much approach to equivalence that it is unreasonable to conclude that the direction on this point prejudicially affected the trial of the case.\nI may only add that when Mr. Eccles gave his testimony what had previously taken place in the objection to and rejection of evidence of his statement to Mr. Robinson became an incident of no importance whatever; and if the learned judge referred to it at all, he might well have added that it had then no significance, inasmuch as the jury had Eccles's evidence before them, which was much more satisfactory than any mere statement of what he had said to another could possibly be. (2) Next, as to the direction respecting the withholding of the evidence taken upon commission. A commission was taken out on behalf of the defendant to examine witnesses in Providence, and other places in the United States touching the plaintiff's earning capacity, &c. The evidence was taken, and one of the judges of the court made an order for its return, but the attorney for the defendant directed the commissioner not to return it, and he did not.\nOn this the learned judge said:\nHowever, it is not here,\u2014and we cannot refer to it\u2014good or bad, but there is this about it, that if Mr. Hesse was here as an impostor and did not receive that income, would it not occur to you that they having gone there and examined those witnesses, is it not an element which may be very fairly considered in determining about it in the absence of contradiction? People cannot play fast and loose. Either they were sincere in going there and getting this evidence, or there was some other motive; but I say to you, while you have not that evidence here, you may consider this when you come to pronounce upon the credibility of Mr. Hesse, because if he is here as an impostor and claiming that he received $4,000 or $5,000 a year and only received $1,500, then it is an imposition upon you to try to get you to believe it and an imposition upon this court. And you must be satisfied upon that reasonably and when you come to consider the matter, I think it is fair for you to consider all those surrounding circumstances.\nNow this really means nothing more than this, that if a defendant sets up that there is evidence contradicting the plaintiff's case available to him, if he is afforded the opportunity of getting it, and if he therefore is afforded such opportunity and gets the evidence of the witnesses, and afterwards does not produce it (it being presumably legal and proper evidence), the testimony of the plaintiff which was sought to be contradicted is thereby strengthened. This assumes that if the facts were otherwise than as represented, this could be shown (and so much may be assumed from what took place in getting and acting on the commission), and, therefore, failure to contradict leaves the plaintiff's statement in undisputed possession of the field so far as this class of opposing testimony is concerned.\nThe learned judge did not refer to the offer of defendant's counsel at the close of the plaintiff's case to have a copy of the evidence taken upon the commission admitted as if it were the original. I think it very likely that if his attention had been drawn to this omission he would have made some reference to it; although I am not prepared to say that, under the circumstances, the offer wholly made up for the failure to adduce the evidence.\n(3) The next objection seems to be a more serious one. On the happening of the accident, the plaintiff was taken to the General Public Hospital in St. John. The medical and surgical staff on that day consisted of Drs. Christie, Maclaren, Emery and T. Walker, jr. Dr. Christie was of opinion that the foot should be at once amputated, and (in his recollection) Dr. Maclaren had the same view. Dr. Emery thought it possible to save the foot, and Dr. Walker agreed with him. Dr. Christie says:\nThe other two were allowed to go on, because if they who had the man in charge (i.e. they who were acting as the staff physicians of the day) thought something could be done towards saving the limb we were not going to insist on doing anything to the contrary.\nDr. Christie adds that the patient appeared to him then to be a man about fifty, and that if he had known that he was in fact under forty he might have thought differently, adding that he was influenced very much by the appearance of the patient. He further says if he were to form a judgment upon the appearance presented by the plaintiff at the trial he should hesitate in advising as he did. The accident occurred on Sunday the 17th of July. On Wednesday Mr. Quigley wrote the company that he had been retained by Mr. Hesse to seek compensation for the injury, and suggested that they appoint a physician to co-operate with Dr. Broderick, the plaintiff's physician, so far as the rules of the hospital would permit. On Thursday the 21st, the company replied that they had appointed Dr. Thos. Walker, jr., to assist Dr. Broderick. By the rules of the hospital Dr. Broderick could not take part in the treatment or in consultations, as not being on the hospital staff, and so Mr. Hesse afterwards appointed Dr. Daniel, a member of the staff, to act as his immediate physician.\nOn the Thursday following another consultation was held, in which Drs. White, Thos. Walker, sr., Thos Walker, jr., Christie, Daniel and Maclaren took part. Dr. Broderick was present but not as a consulting physician. As a result, the leg was put up in plaster.\nOn Sunday the 24th, owing to the progress of disease in the injured member, another consultation was held by Drs. White, T. Walker, jr., and one or two others, when it was decided to amputate at once, and Drs. White and T. Walker, jr., as respectively the surgeon and general practitioner of the day, performed the operation*.\nDr. Daniel says that the ordinary rule\namong physicians is to save the limb if possible,\nand Mr. Quigley in opening to the jury said:\nWe were all very anxious that Professor Hesse's foot should be preserved if possible.\nNotwithstanding this he alleged that\nDr. Walker for the company strongly resisted the amputation, hopeful that the foot would he saved, and thus a large sum of money saved to the company.\nAnd we find the learned judge saying: It has been put forward here on the one side that the amputation ought to have taken place upon the very day that the accident occurred.\nHe then refers to a conversation which Dr Broderick who had been in favour of an earlier amputation, says that he had with Dr. Walker, jr., in a street car after leaving the hospital on Thursday the 21st, in which Dr. Walker said (according to Dr. Broderick) that\nif he could get Mr. Quigley to look at it from the standpoint of view as a surgeon and not use it as a means of appealing to the sympathies of the jury he might consider himself more fully the question of the idea of amputation.\nThis is Dr. Broderick's final version given upon re-examination After referring to the facts at some length the learned judge continues thus:\nIt seems to me a very important thing indeed if Dr. Walker was there using his position and his voice as one of the hospital staff to keep the limb on when it ought to have been taken off. All I can say is that it is very reprehensible. That is what Dr. Broderick said, however, and it is for you to say whether you credit his statement or not.\nWhen Dr. Walker on Sunday, the 17th, favoured trying to save the limb he had not been spoken to by the company, nor was he spoken to for three or four days after that. There was therefore no ground whatever for the suggestion that the company was responsible for the amputation not having taken place \"upon the very day that the accident occurred.\" And as to what Dr. Broderick states as being said by Dr. Walker, following the Thursday consultation, it perhaps may fairly mean no more than that if he could be sure that Mr. Quigley would look at it from a surgeon's standpoint instead of using it, i.e. the amputation, as a means of appealing to the sympathies of the jury, he might reconsider his opinion, Dr. Broderick being so strongly in favour of amputation. The learned trial judge in his dissenting opinion at term, after quoting from his charge, says:\nI cannot myself discover any statement here from which it could be reasonably or fairly inferred that the jury were instructed that they should consider the conduct of Dr. Walker as a reason for enhancing the damages against the company. * * * The remarks were only intended to apply to Dr Walker as a physician and to his conduct in treating this man Hesse, not using his position as the physician of the company, but using his position as one of the consulting physicians to prevent early amputation for fear amputation might lead to increased damages against the company. It was in reference to his conduct in using his position as a member of the consulting staff that the remarks were made, as showing that he, although a medical man and there to advise, presumably in the best interests of the patient, allowed him to suffer for some days without amputation when, but for him, amputation would have taken place at an earlier day. And while it may not be clear from the evidence, it is apparent, I think, to any one who carefully peruses it, that amputation was delayed as long as it was through his instrumentality.\nI cannot agree as to this appearing upon the evidence. At the time of the first consultation Dr. Walker was independent of the company. On the second and larger consultation, it does not appear that he did more than express his opinion, and, for all that appears, two-thirds of the consulting staff may have been of the like mind, certainly the majority were; and, further, it is not proved at all, in a way to be assumed as a fact, that it was not the most prudent and correct course, to endeavour to save the foot, down to the day on which it was in fact taken off. The operation was successfully performed, and the patient had a good recovery.\nThe learned judge's explanation of his charge shows that a matter which, in his view, could not affect, and ought not to have affected, the damages, was so laid before the jury that they would suppose that it was material to the case. Why was it declared to be most important? And why were the jury asked to pass upon it? Manifestly the jury would consider it as bearing upon the contention of plaintiff that the amputation ought to have taken place on the very day on which the accident occurred. It is impossible to say that it was not calculated to affect the amount of the verdict. It was very important in this case to keep all irrelevant disputes out of it. There are besides expressions in the charge which cannot have been sufficiently considered, as, for instance, where the jury are told to ask themselves:\nIf I were Hesse, under the evidence, how much ought I to he paid if the company did me an injury?\nSuppose the contrary were put:\nIf I were the defendant, under the evidence, how much ought I to pay?\nIt is perhaps impossible to prevent jurors looking at a case in this way, but at least they ought not to be invited to do so, and such direct resorts or appeals to the feelings and interests of the individual jurymen can only exercise a disturbing or misleading influence. In Phillips v. London &South Western Railway Co.[1] the form of the usual and well sanctioned direction in such cases is given, and it seems to me (with all respect to the very learned judge) that too many disturbing and confusing considerations got into the case, with the result of a verdict which, to say the least, is unusually large in this country.\nThe weakness of the plaintiff's case (if I may say so) was that his evidence was general and uncertain where it might be expected to be precise, and left the area for surmise and conjecture too large. The learned judge says in his charge that Hesse himself did not give the best information possible. Upon the whole then I think that the verdict cannot be sustained and that there should be a new trial. A provision of the New Brunswick Statute, 60 Vict. c. 24 (sec. 371) enacts that a new trial may be ordered on any question in an action, whatever be the ground for the new trial, without interfering with the finding or decision upon any other question.\nThe verdict or finding of the jury in this case is for the plaintiff, with damages assessed at $25,000. I think it competent under the above statute to order that the new trial be limited to the assessment of damages, the finding as to the liability of the defendant to the plaintiff in respect of the alleged cause of action not being interfered with; and in my opinion the judgment ought to be varied to this extent, and the appeal dismissed subject to such variation.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice King.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: R. F. Quigley.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H. H. McLean.\n[1] 5 C. P. D. 280.\n"}

N. A. Act, 1867, sec. 111\u2014Debts of Province of Canada\u2014Deferred liabilities\u2014Toll bridge\u20148 Vict. ch. 90 (Can.)\u2014Reversion to Crown\u2014Indemnity\u2014Arbitration and award\u2014Condition precedent\u2014Petition of right\u2014Remedial process.\nA toll bridge with its necessary buildings and approaches was built and maintained by Y. at Chambly, in the Province of Quebec, in 1845, under a franchise granted to him by an Act (8 Vict. ch. 90), of the late Province of Canada, in 1845, on the condition therein expressed that on the expiration of the term of fifty years the works should vest in the Crown as a free bridge for public use and that Y., or his representatives should then be compensated therefor by the Crown, provision being also made for ascertaining the value of the works by arbitration and award.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, (6 Ex. C. R. 103,) that the claim of the suppliants for the value of the works at the time they vested in the Crown on the expiration of the fifty years franchise was a liability of the late Province of Canada coming within the operation of the 111th section of the British North America Act, 1867, and thereby imposed on the Dominion; that there was no lien or right of retention charged upon the property; and that the fact that the liability was not presently payable at the date of the passing of the British North America Act, 1867, was immaterial. The Attorney-General of Canada v. The Attorney-General of Ontario, ( [1897] A. C. 199; 25 Can. S. C. R. 434) followed.\nHeld also, that the arbitration provided for by the third section of the Act, 8 Vict. ch. 90, did not impose the necessity of obtaining an award as a condition precedent but merely afforded a remedy for the recovery of the value of the works at a time when the parties interested could not have resorted to the present remedy by petition of right, and that the suppliants claim for compensation under the provisions of that Act, (8 Vict. ch. 90,) was a proper subject for petition of right within the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] in favour of the suppliants.\nThe judgment of the Exchequer Court upon the petition of right held that the suppliants, who are the representatives and assigns of John Yule, the younger, were entitled to recover from Her Majesty, as represented by the Government of Canada, the value of a bridge and its dependencies situated at Chambly, in the Province of Quebec, the value to be ascertained by three referees appointed by the judge. The referees, after hearing the evidence, reported the value to be $36,810.82, and upon their report the court adjudged the amount so found to the suppliants.\nThe claim arose under a statute of the late Province of Canada, 8 Vict ch. 90, by which John Yule was authorized to build a toll-bridge over the river Richelieu, in the vicinity of Chambly, and also to build a toll-house and turnpike with other dependencies on or near the bridge, and for this purpose he was empowered to take and use the lands on either side of the river upon making compensation to the owners and occupiers. The third section of the statute vested the bridge, etc., in said Yule, his heirs and assigns, for fifty years from the date of its assent, (29th March, 1845,) when it should revert to Her Majesty as a free bridge for public use, and provided that it should then be lawful for the said Yule, his heirs, etc., \"to claim and obtain from Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, the full and entire value which the same shall, at the end of the said fifty years, bear and be worth exclusive of the value of any toll or privilege, the said value to be ascertained by three arbitrators, one of whom to be named by the Governor of the province for the time being, another by the said John Yule, the younger, his heirs, executors, curators or assigns, and the third by the said two arbitrators.\"\nThe Crown did not raise any question on the appeal as to the findings of the referees on the valuation of the property but denied any liability on the part of the Dominion of Canada under the British North America Act, 1867.\nNewcombe Q. C., Deputy of the Minister of Justice of Canada, for the appellant. The property consists of lands in the Province of Quebec, and passed to that province under sec. 109 B. N. A Act, \"subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof and to any interest other than that of the province in the same.\" Trusts existed at the time the B. N. A. Act was passed and consisted, at least, of the obligation of the province to pay for the bridge upon assuming possession thereof within the period of fifty years, and in that case perhaps, the further obligation to hand it over to the inhabitants interested in case they should make the payments stipulated for by the Act[2]. There was also the interest of Yule unless terminated by one of the modes authorized by the Act.\nThe liability on the part of the Crown to discharge any trust existing in respect of lands vested in the province under sec. 109 B. N. A. Act, and pay for any interest other than that of the province in the same, are not cast upon the Dominion under section 111, but are chargeable solely against the province to which the lands passed Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for Ontario[3], at pages 210 and 211. See also the observations of Lord Selborne, in Attorney-General of Ontario v. Mercer[4], at pp. 775 and 776. Even up to the present time the property stands in the Crown subject to a trust or interest in favour of the inhabitants concerned who may at any time acquire the property by paying the statutory valuation. Moreover, the property vested in the Province of Quebec subject to a contractual or legal duty on the part of the province to pay the value thereof, unless it had in the meantime been taken over by the inhabitants, and such contractual or legal duty in itself constituted a trust within the meaning of section 109.\nIn the circumstances as they have resulted the property itself is liable to make good the compensation by reason of the vendor's lien for the unpaid purchase money. At the time of constructing the bridge the fee simple in the lands occupied by the bridge and its dependencies was vested in Yule, who bore the whole cost of constructing and maintaining the bridge. The statute was not intended to take away this estate or property except upon payment of the statutory valuation. See Walker v. Ware, Hadham and Buntingford Railway Co.[5], per Romilly M. R. and Arts. 2009 and 2014 C. C.\nSection 3 of 8 Vict. ch. 90 provides for compensation from Her Majesty for the value of the property to be ascertained by three arbitrators, one named by the Governor of the province, another by Yule, and the third by the two arbitrators. It was in any case intended that no liability should accrue until the ascertainment of the amount by an award obtained in the statutory manner, and thus the very first essential on which alone the liability might arise is wanting, and that without any act or default attributable to the Dominion. It is said that the provinces which constituted the late Province of Canada waived arbitration, but no cause of action arising out of that circumstance, or because the provinces declined to appoint an arbitrator, can constitute a debt or liability existing at the union, for such cause of action, if any arose out of dealings long subsequent to the union, and which could not have been anticipated at that time. The proposition that the Dominion has waived its defence by granting a fiat upon the petition of right is quite untenable. The granting of a fiat does not take away any defence otherwise available. Consequently, as there has been no arbitration or award, no action will lie to recover the compensation money. Viney v. Bignold[6]; Babbage v. Coulburn[7], (affirmed on appeal); Russell on Awards, (7 ed.) 60 to 63; Elliott v. Royal Exchange Assurance Co.[8]; Scott v. Corporation of Liverpool[9]; Fox v. The Railroad[10]; Scott v. Avery[11]; Caledonian Insurance Co. v. Gilmour[12] at page 90, per Herschell L. C., and again at page 95, per Watson L. J.\nThe statute has given the right and provided the remedy, and no other remedy can be invoked. Murray v. Dawson[13]; Hepburn v. Township of Orford et al.[14]; Vestry of St. Paneras v. Batterbury[15]; Berkeley v. Elderkin[16]; Mayor of Montreal v. Drummond[17]. When a new statute prescribes a particular remedy no other can be taken. Stevens v. Evans[18] at page 1157; Doe d. Bishop of Rochester v. Bridges[19] at p. 859, per Lord Tenderden, and see reference to general doctrine in Underhill v. Ellicombe[20], per Erle J. in Stevens v. Jeacocke[21], at p. 741.\nThe word \"debt\" in sec. 112 B. N. A. Act, must be intended to include \"debts and liabilities under section 111 so far as Ontario and Quebec are concerned, and upon the construction of sections 109 to 112 inclusively, and having regard to sections 117, 120 and 142, it was not intended that Ontario should incur any liability in respect to unpaid purchase money of lands in Quebec becoming the sole property of Quebec at the Union. If that be so, the present claim is not included in section 111. For the award under sec. 142 see Sessional Papers of Canada, 1871, no. 21. Neither section Hi nor any other provision of the B. N. A. Act makes the Dominion directly responsible. The Dominion is only liable for such payments of this kind as are assumed by the Dominion. See sec. 120. The Dominion did not assume this payment or any obligation therefor.\nHer Majesty has not taken possession of nor accepted the bridge or any of its dependencies but, on the contrary, the suppliants have remained in possession up to the present time, although their statutory authority expired on 29th March, 1895, and they cannot maintain this action while remaining in possession of the property and exacting tolls.\nThe Exchequer Court had no jurisdiction as the claim does not arise under any law of Canada within the meaning of section 16 (b) of the Exchequer Court Act.\nLafleur Q.C. and Sinclair for the respondents. The obligation here is not a conditional one, but an obligation with a term, debitum in prcesenti solvendum in futuro, at the date of Confederation, and clearly was made a liability imposed upon the Dominion by the 111th section of the B. N. A. Act, and the date on which payment would become due, viz., the expiration of the term of the franchise, was absolutely certain, being fixed by statute. This is more evidently within that clause of the B. N. A. Act than the claim for payment of the increased annuities to the Indians in the cases of The Attorney General of Canada v. The Attorney General of Ontario[22], which depended upon an uncertain event. Section 109 can have no possible application to the present case. The lands there referred to are those belonging to the several provinces at the time of the union, and these words apply only to ungranted lands.\nWe refer to The Fisheries Case[23], at pages 514 and 515. It is manifest that during the term of fifty years the Yules were absolute owners of the property and could have dealt with it as proprietors subject to the defeasance of their title at the expiration of the charter. They have in fact been regarded as owners of the fee and have been taxed as such; Yule v. Corporation of Chambly[24]. There was no trust existing in respect of this land chargeable to the Province of Quebec, under section 109 of the B. N. A. Act. The amount to be paid to the Yules as representing the value of the bridge and dependencies is in no sense a payment to be made out of the lands. The lands vested in the Crown before the payment of the indemnity was exigible, and the suppliants have only a bare claim for compensation which can in no sense be said to be a lien or privilege on the land. The Crown was under no legal or contractual duty to pay the Yules out of the beneficial estate of the bridge or its proceeds. There was to be simply a personal payment by the Crown to the Yules. The jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court is complete as the present claim arises both under a law of the old Province of Canada and under the 111th section of the B. N. A. Act, which is undoubtedly a \"Law of Canada.\"\nThe Legislature did not make reference to arbitration a condition precedent to the right of action. There was not at the time any court having jurisdiction by petition of right or otherwise to hear and determine claims against the Crown, and the proceeding prescribed by the statute for determining the value of the bridge and its dependencies was not one that could have been invoked without the Crown's consent. There could not have been any intention to exclude ordinary legal remedies and procedure which were not then in existence. The statute first creates the right and then provides a mode of ascertaining the amount of the claim, indicating a special mode of proof, but making no conditions precedent to the assertion and exercise of the right. When the Exchequer Court Act came in force all the old remedies were superseded and a new mode of enforcing the claim became available.\nThe obligation is severable from the provision for reference to arbitration. Ulrich v. National Insurance Co.[25]; Collins v. Locke[26]; Dawson v. Fitzgerald[27]. If reference to arbitration is insisted upon as a condition precedent to the action, the liability to pay must be taken to be admitted and all other defences abandoned. Hughes v. Hand-in-Hand Ins. Co.[28]; Goldslone v. Osborn[29]. But there has been a complete waiver of the right to arbitrate. The suppliants, before proceeding, requested the Dominion Government to appoint arbitrators. That request was thereupon communicated to the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec and, in accordance with the express wish of both provinces, arbitrators were not named but the suppliants were invited to urge their claim by a petition of right and the Crown, deferring to the wishes of the provinces, granted its fiat and abstained from appointing an arbitrator.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014We are of opinion that the judgment of the Exchequer Court is entirely right and that the appeal fails.\nThe suppliant's title is not disputed, nor has the amount found by the referee been made a subject of appeal; on the contrary we find in the record a statement that\nthe appellant does not in this appeal raise a question as to the valuation of the property as found by the referees.\nThe first question raised by the appeal is whether or not this claim is a liability of the late Province of Canada coming within section 111 of the British North America Act. The object of that section was to give the creditors of the old Province of Canada an ascertained debtor against whom they might seek the recovery of their debts without being compelled to await the result of the arbitration provided by the statute for the apportionment of such liabilities. It is impossible to conceive a clearer case for the application of that section than the present. By the third section of the Act, 8 Vict. ch. 90, under which the bridge was built, it is enacted that at the end of fifty years from the passing of the Act (the 29th March, 1845) the bridge, toll-house, turnpike and dependencies, and the ascents and approaches thereto, should be vested in Her Majesty, Her heirs and successors, and be free for public use, and it then proceeds to provide for compensation in the following terms: And it shall then be lawful for the said John Yule, the younger, his heirs, executors, curators and assigns, to claim and obtain from Her Majesty, Her heirs and successors, the full and entire value which the same shall at the end of the said fifty years bear and be worth, exclusive of the value of any toll or privilege; the said value to be ascertained by three arbitrators, one of whom to be named by the governor of the province for the time being, another by the said John Yule, the younger, his heirs, executors, curators or assigns, and the third by the said two arbitrators.\nNo mention is made of any charge or lien upon, or right of retention of, the property itself, nor was there any need for any since the builder of the bridge, John Yule, and his representatives had the best security which could have been assured to them, the declared statutory liability of the Crown. That it was not a presently payable liability at the date of the passing of the British North America Act can make no difference since the case of the Attorney General of Canada v. The Attorney General of Ontario[30] determines that contingent and deferred as well as present liabilities come within the 111th section. Had the amount of the valuation been made a charge on the property itself there might be some ground for saying that the Province of Quebec took the bridge at the time at which the statute vested it in the Crown cum onere but as I have said, there can be no pretence for this as is shown by the case in the Judicial Committee, already cited, relating to the Indian annuities. The liability was purely and simply a debt of the late Province of Canada imposed at Confederation on the Dominion.\nThen it is said that the ascertainment of the amount by arbitration was a condition precedent to any right of the suppliant to recover payment. I had occasion to say at the argument that after the correspondence which we find printed in the case between the executive officers of the Dominion and the two provinces, this objection seems a harsh proceeding on the part of the Dominion Government. That Government has really no interest in the question since under the British North America Act it is to be recouped by the provinces for any advance which it may have to make to pay this claim, and the provinces upon whom or upon one of whom this liability must ultimately fall insist upon a proceeding in this form by petition of right and object to a reference to arbitration. I am of opinion, however, that apart from any consent the objection is not maintainable. As the learned judge of the Exchequer Court has pointed out, at the time of the passing of the Act, 8 Vict. ch. 90, there was in Canada no procedure by which the Crown could without its consent be sued. In neither of the divisions of Upper and Lower Canada into which the Province of Canada was practically divided for judicial purposes could the remedy by petition of right be resorted to. The preliminary steps indispensable for obtaining the royal sign manual to the requisite indorsement of a petition of right could not be taken here. The remedy of the subject in this form whether in the provinces or in the Dominion, as is well known, now depends altogether on legislation since Confederation. Therefore it is reasonable to infer that the provision about arbitration contained in the third section of 8 Vict. ch. 90, is not to be considered as imposed by way of condition precedent but merely to afford the party in whose favour it was manifestly introduced a remedy for the recovery of the value of the bridge, and the only remedy which up to the date of Confederation he had. Then it is not without significance that the arbitration is not in terms made a condition precedent but according to the plain import of the words added as a remedial proceeding. Further, this is not a proceeding to enforce the original liability but a liability imposed upon the Grown as representing the Dominion by a subsequent statute, the British North America Act. That it is a debt of Canada within the meaning of that expression in the Exchequer Court Act there cannot be a doubt, if I am right in holding that it comes within the 111th section of the British North America Act. Upon this point I agree with and adopt the observations of the learned judge of the Court of Exchequer.\nOn the whole we are of opinion that the claim of the suppliant is in all respects a valid, legal and subsisting claim which is a proper subject of a petition of right within the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court, and that after the correspondence between the Dominion and the provinces which has been made part of the record, and after the Act of the Dominion in assenting to the petition of right, the objection that the suppliant's only remedy is by arbitration is one without any foundation and ought not to have been insisted on.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.*\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Canada: E.

J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA APPEAL SIDE.\nLandlord and tenant Conditions of lease\u2014Construction of deed\u2014Practice\u2014Objections first taken on appeal.\nWhere the issues have been joined in a suit and judgment rendered upon pleadings admitting and relying upon a written instrument, an objection to the validity of the instrument taken for the first time on an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada comes too late and cannot be entertained.\nWhere a written lease of lands provides for the payment of indemnity to the lessees in case they should be dispossessed by the lessor before the expiration of the term of the lease, the lessees are entitled to claim the indemnity upon being so dispossessed although the eviction may be for cause, inasmuch as the lessor could not, under the lease, dispossess the lessee except for breach of the conditions therein mentioned.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, appeal side, affirming, (to the extent of $6,942 and costs,) the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, which had awarded to the suppliants, upon their petition of right, the sum of $7,742 for damages and their costs.\nA statement of the questions at issue on the appeal appears in the judgment reported.\nDuffy Q.C. and Cannon Q.C. for the appellant. Fitzpatrick Q.C. and Mar\u00e9chal for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is a petition of right wherein the petitioner claims indemnity from the Government of the Province of Quebec under the terms and provisions of a clause in a lease set out in the petition of right and which the petitioner alleges was executed by the Provincial Government through the intervention of a Mr. Nantel the Commissioner of Public Works in the Province of Quebec, upon and bearing date the second day of March, 1892. To this petition of right the Government of the province plead by way of defence.\n1. The general issue.\n2. That in the said lease upon which the petition of right is based it is expressly stipulated that the lessee shall not transfer his right to the lease or sublet the premises in whole or in part without the express consent in writing of the lessor, and that no such consent was ever given by the defendant or by any person for that purpose duly authorized.\n3. That by the said lease the lessee is obliged to make certain repairs at the earliest possible time at his own expense, &c., &c.,\n5. That by the said lease the sole amount which \u00a1the lessee could demand in case of dispossession before the expiration of the term was, &c., &c., (not material to be now set forth.)\n6. That the petitioners cannot claim any such indemnity from the defendant because of their eviction, that indemnity being satisfied and extinguished by the value of the repairs which remained unexecuted by the lessees at the time of their eviction.\nIssue being joined on these pleas the case was brought down for trial and the petitioners produced\n[Page.38]\nthe lease under which they claimed and which was set out in the petition of right and it appeared to be-in notarial form as between the Government of the Province of Quebec represented by William Alphonse Nantel in his capacity of Commissioner of Public Works, lessors, &c.\nThe defendants did not in the Superior Court, nor until the case was brought by appeal into this court, make any objection whatever to the validity of the lease but the case was tried upon the issues joined on the other pleas upon all of which the defendants rested their contestation, and they produced a notarial instrument by which they contended that the government of the province had determined the lease by reason of a breach having been committed by the lessees having sublet divers parcels of the premises without consent in writing, contrary to the provisions of the lease in that behalf, and that therefore, as they have contended and still do contend the lessees have lost all claim to the indemnity guaranteed by the lease in case of dispossession before the expiration of the lease. This instrument contained an express recognition of the lease as valid. The defendants now in this court, while insisting upon all their pleas upon the record, (which not only admit the due execution of the lease, but rely upon it as a good and valid lease, of the terms and provisions of which they claim the benefit,) nevertheless insist that the lease never had any validity whatever for the reason that it was not countersigned by the Commissioner's own secretary which they contend is a statutory pre-requisite to the validity of a lease to be binding on the Government. Thus while the validity of the lease-was never questioned during any stage of the progress of the case to judgment in the Superior Court, nor at all as already observed until the judgment pronounced in the case was brought into this court upon appeal, they ask this court to nullify the judgment rendered upon the issues joined on the pleas of the defendant admitting and relying upon the validity of the lease.\nUnder these circumstances we do not think the court is required to entertain an objection never made during the progress of the case to judgment in the courts below. We think we are therefore quite justified in holding that the objection now made for the first time in appeal before this court is for the reasons above given altogether too late and cannot be entertained.\nProceeding then to the contention that the clause in the lease prohibiting the execution of any sublease without the consent in writing specified in the lease, and without dealing with a question which was argued as to the sufficiency of the proof offered of such a consent having been given, which consisted of secondary evidence only we find that the clause in the lease as to indemnity expressly provides that\nif the lessor should dispossess the lessee before the expiration of this present lease the lessee shall have the right to an indemnity equal:\n1. To the cost of the improvements made as aforesaid to the said premises by the lessee, deducting an amount proportionate to the time that the lessee shall have occupied the said premises ;\n2 To the damages which the said lessees may suffer by eviction before the expiration of the lease.\nNow in this guarantee clause the right to indemnity upon eviction before the expiration of the term is not qualified by any condition affecting the right to indemnify in case the eviction should be for a breach of any of the conditions or covenants in the lease on the lessees' part to be observed and kept. If the lessors evict the lessee the right to indemnity Co instanti arises. Now the lessors could not evict the lessees before the expiration of the lease except because of some breach by the lessees of some condition or covenant in the lease to be observed and performed by them; it cannot therefore be contended that the lessees lose their right to indemnity if the eviction should be for cause, since the eviction could not take place except for such cause, and it is upon the actual occurrence of dispossession by the lessor that the right to indemnity arises under the express terms of the lease.\nNow as to the amount of such indemnity. I think we think take the evidence to establish that the lessees expended $2,500 of the $2,885 named in the lease upon the works required to be done by the estimate of Mr. Raza, and that they expended a much larger sum on other repairs than those required by Raza. This $2500 had to be, and no doubt was, expended with promptitude as the lessees' profits absolutely depended upon the premises (which were in a dilapidated condition) being made tenantable. We may allow perhaps six months for the making of them, and during that period the lessees would have no profit; indeed calculating the utmost value per annum of the premises to the lessees after the completion of the improvements and deducting there from $2,500 expended in improvements, and $160 per annum for the faxes and the $500 per annum we have the condition of the matter at the expiration of four years when the lessees were evicted as follows:\nMonies expended in improvements, by\nway of rent in advance $2,500 00\nRent and taxes per annum $660 x 4... 2,640 00\nTotal disbursements $5 140 00\nReceipts, first half year $ 880 00\nSecond, third and fourth years at\n$1,760.00 x 3. 5,280 00\n$6,160 00 or receipts in excess of disbursements at the expiration of the fourth year amounting to $1,020 only. Until the fourth year therefore the lessees derived no profit whatever from the premises leased; for the remaining five years of the lease the profits of the lessees calculated on the above basis would be precisely $1,100 per annum x 5 years = $5,500.00 to which must I think reasonably be added a sum to cover interest upon the investment of those profits from time to time as they accrued, which may be, I think, stated at $700.00 or in the whole $6,200.00. I cannot see that the lessees can be entitled to any more. The outlay of the $2,500 was required to be expended to create the profits, and I cannot see any pretence of right that the lessees can have to any proportion of the balance of $385 which they covenanted to expend but did not expend upon the particular improvements required by Raza's estimate.\nI would vary the judgment in favour of the respondents by reducing it to $6,200 for which judgment should be entered for them on the petition of right with interest from date of judgment in the Superior Court with costs, and then dismiss the appeal and I see no reason why the dismissal should not be also with costs, for the defence insisted on was under the circumstances a very unjust one.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.

C\u2014Exoneration from liability\u2014R. S. C. c. 38 s. 50.\nArt. 3056 C. C. embodies the action previously given by a statute of the Province of Canada re-enacting Lord Campbell's Act. Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. ([1892] A. C. 481) distinguished.\nA workman may so contract with his employer as to exonerate the latter from liability for negligence, and such renunciation would be an answer to an action under Lord Campbell's Act. Griffiths v. Earl Dudley (9 Q. B. D. 357) followed.\nIn sec. 50 of the Government Railways Act (R. S. C. ch. 38) providing that \"Her Majesty shall not be relieved from liability by any notice, condition or declaration in the event of any damage arising from any negligence, omission or default of any officer, employee or servant of the Minister,\" the words \"notice, condition or declaration\" do not include a contract or agreement by which an employee has renounced his right to claim damages from the Crown for injury from negligence of his fellow servants., Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Vogel (11 Can. S. C. R. 612) disapproved.\nAn employee on the Intercolonial Railway became a member of the Intercolonial Railway Relief and Assurance Association, to the funds of which the Government contributed annually $6,000. In consequence of such contribution a rule of the Association provided that the members renounced all claims against the Crown arising from injury or death in the course of their employment. The employee having been killed in discharge of his duty by negligence of a fellow servant. Held, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court (6 Can. Ex. C. R. 276) that the rule of the association was an answer to an action by his widow under Art. 1056 C. C. to recover compensation for his death.\nThe doctrine of common employment does not prevail in the Province of Quebec. The Queen v. Filion (24 Can. S. C. R. 482) followed.\nAppeal from a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] in favour of the suppliant.\nThe suppliant, Emily Grenier, brings this action on behalf of herself and her infant children to recover damages for the death of her husband, Xavier Letellier, who was employed in his lifetime as fireman upon the Intercolonial Railway, and who was killed in an accident on the 2nd of May, 1898, that happened on that railway.\nThe action is based in the first place on clause (c) of the 16th section of The Exchequer Court Act which provides that the Exchequer Court shall have, exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine, amongst other things, every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property on any public work resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment. The suppliant further relies on Article 1056 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada, which provides that \"in all cases where a person injured by the commission of an offence or a quasi offence dies in consequence, without having obtained indemnity or satisfaction his consort and his ascendant and descendant relations have a right but only within a year after his death to recover from the person who committed the offence or quasi offence, or his representatives, all damages occasioned by such death.\"\nIn addition to the fact that the deceased and those through whose negligence he lost his life were fellow-servants in the employ of the Crown, the admissions of the parties shows that he was at the time of his death a member of an association known as the Intercolonial Railway Employees' Relief and Assurance Association, which is composed of the employees of Her Majesty in the railway service and to which they make certain contributions, and from the funds of which certain allowances in accordance with the rules and regulations thereof are made to the members of the association in the case of accident or illness, or to their families in case of death. To the funds of this association the Government of Canada contributes six thousand dollars annually, in consideration of which it was made a rule of the association that the Government should be relieved of all claims for compensation for injuries to or for the death of any member of the association. All permanent male employees of the railway are members of the association and contribute to its funds as an incident of their employment, and without any option or choice on their part; and the fees and assessments payable by them are deducted on the pay-roll from the amounts due to them for salary or wages. The object of the association is to provide relief to members while suffering through illness or bodily injury, and in case of death to provide a sum of money for the benefit of the family or relatives of deceased members. With reference to the insurance against death or total disablement there are three classes of members. In Class A the member when totally disabled, or his heirs or assigns in case of death, are entitled to one thousand dollars; in Class B to five hundred dollars; and in Class C to two hundred and fifty dollars. Upon the death or total disablement of a member every surviving members pays an assessment proportionate to the amount of his insurance. Those in Class A pay four times as much as, and those in Class B twice as much as those in Class C. In this way the amount to be raised is divided among and borne by the surviving members, and it is provided that the insurance money collected from death or total disability levies or assessments shall be paid to the person totally disabled or to the person named by the deceased member. If no person is named it is to be paid to his widow, and if there is no widow, to the executors or administrators of the deceased member. Letellier belonged to Class C. He had received a copy of the constitution, rules and regulations of the association and had signed the certificate of membership in force at his death, directing all insurance money accruing thereon to be paid to his wife. It was admitted that he was aware of the rules and regulations mentioned, but it was claimed that the admission was made through inadvertence. Receipts for copies of the constitution, rules and regulations of the association signed by the deceased were produced. It also appeared that the suppliant, Emily Grenier, had been paid the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars, to which under her husband's certificate of membership and the rules and regulations of the association she became at his death entitled; and it was contended for the Crown that in view of these facts the petition could not be maintained.\nTo this contention two replies were made. In the first in support of the petition reliance was placed, as has been stated, upon Article 1056 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada, and the case of Robinson v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[2], as showing that the suppliants have an independent and not a representative right of action, which was maintainable, as the deceased did not in his lifetime obtain either indemnity or satisfaction for his injuries. And it was argued that this right is one which as against the suppliant the deceased could not discharge the Crown unless in his lifetime he obtained such indemnity or satisfaction; that he could not agree with the Crown in advance that it should be relieved from any such action by his widow and children.\nThen in the second place it was said in support of the petition that any agreement to relieve the Crown from all claim for compensation for injury or death where the same arises from the negligence of a servant of the Crown would be bad under the 50th section of the Government Railway Act, and could not be invoked by the Crown in answer to the petition That section, so far as it is material to the present case, provides that \"Her Majesty shall not be relieved from liability by any notice, condition or declaration in the event of any damage arising from any negligence, omission or default of any officer, employee or servant of the Minister.\"\nThe judgment of the Exchequer Court was based on the grounds that Art. 1056 C. C. gave a new cause of action to the widow which could not be affected by anything done by deceased in his lifetime, and if it could, that sec. 50 of The Government Railways Act precluded the defence founded on the rules of the insurance association of which deceased was a member. The Crown appealed.\nFitzpatrick Q.C. Solicitor General for Canada, and Lafontaine Q.C. for the appellant. Independently of statute the Crown is not liable for tortious acts of its officers or servants; Canterbury v. The Attorney General[3]; Tobin v. The Queen[4]; leather v. The Queen[5] at page 295. The Petitions of Right Act did not alter the law in this respect; The Queen v. McLeod[6]; The Queen v. McFarlane[7]; City of Quebec v. The Queen[8], at 423 per Strong C. J. The 16th section of the Act 50 & 51 Vict. ch. 16, did not create any liability where none formerly existed. Whatever was the intention of section 16, it must receive a uniform construction all over the Dominion; it was intended to operate in each part of Canada in precisely the same way and with precisely the same effect. Hence it is quite immaterial to consider the provisions of Article 1056 of the Civil Code of Quebec. The Judicial Committee seem to have considered, in the case of Robinson v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[9], that in the Province of Quebec, the relatives of deceased have an independent and not a representative right. There is, therefore, no uniformity of provincial legislation to which the Dominion statute can reasonably be held to have had reference, and it becomes necessary, if the Dominion statute be held to have imposed a new liability, to determine, irrespective of the various provincial enactments, what is the nature of the claim arising out of death to which the Act refers, who may be the claimants, and what is to be the measure of damages. The determination of these questions, whatever it may be, must exclude claims in respect of which the deceased, had he survived, could have maintained no action.\nArticle 1056 of the Civil Code does not apply to the Crown. Exchange Bank v. The Queen[10]; Maritime Bank v. The Queen[11] and authorities there cited; Chitty's Prerogatives of the Crown, 4 et seq., and 25; Attorney General v. Black[12].\nIn all cases where the greater rights and prerogatives of the Crown come in question recourse must be had to the public law of the empire as that alone by which such rights and prerogatives can be determined. Attorney General v. Black[13].\nIn Monk v. Ouimet[14], Dorion C J. enunciated the rule that when the colony passed under the dominion of the Crown of England the maintenance of the civil law then in existence as guaranteed by treaty or altered by competent authority were in force and binding on the Crown except where the higher prerogatives are affected. The result will be the same if the principles of the French common law be held to apply. Burlamaqui, \"Principles du Droit de la Nature et des Gens,\" vol. 4, 98 et seq. Vattel's Law Nations, Chitty's translation, 15 and 16.\nSection 50 of the Government Railway Act[15] does not affect the right of the Crown to stipulate with its employees nor apply to relations between the Crown and its servants. That section does not, by its own terms and the context, extend beyond the case of carriage of goods by passengers.\nThe suppliant accepted the amount of the insurance upon the life of deceased, payable by the association, and is consequently estopped from setting up any claim inconsistent with these rules and regulations, and from maintaining this action.\nThe suppliant can have no right of action if the deceased himself never had such right, and any defence which would have been available against the deceased, had he survived, may be set up in this action. Such is the established rule in actions under Lord Campbell's Act. Addison on Torts, (8 ed.), 604 et seq.; Griffiths v. The Earl of Dudley[16]. The deceased was a member of the. Intercolonial Railway Employees' Relief and Assurance Association, and, in consideration of an annual contribution, the Government was relieved of all claims for compensation for injury or death of any member. These rules were in force at the time of the accident and throughout the whole period of the employment of the deceased, and the contribution by the Crown had continued during the whole period. These facts constitute an agreement by the deceased with the Government by which he accepted the contribution and the advantages to which he might be entitled under the rules of the association in lieu of any claim for damages. He would, therefore, have been precluded from maintaining this action had he survived, and the suppliant is likewise precluded. As to the construction of this section reliance is placed upon the reasoning of Mr. Justice Strong in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Vogel[17], at pages 625 et seq. See also Robertson v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[18], at pages 615 et seq., and the Glengoil Steamship Co. v. Pilkington[19].\nIf the Crown be held bound by art. 1056 C. C., the arrangement between the Government, the association and the deceased constituted indemnity or satisfaction in the lifetime of the deceased within the meaning of that article; otherwise the case must be regarded as one in which the deceased never had any claim and therefore never could have obtained indemnity or satisfaction, in which case the article does not confer any cause of action upon the suppliant. See Bourgeault v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[20].\nThe negligence causing the accident was that of the fellow servants of the deceased, and occurred in the course of their common employment, and on that account the Crown is not responsible. Hogg Q.C. for the respondent. The action arose under arts. 1054 and 1056 C. C., and the Exchequer Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the case under 50 & 51 Vict. ch. 16, sec. 16. Both the Supreme and the Exchequer Courts have applied the principle of the employer's responsibility for the acts of his overseers to Her Majesty in relation with Government employees as well as the maxim \"respondent superior.\" The Queen v. Martin[21], per Patterson J. at page 250; The Queen v. Filion[22], per Gwynne J. at page 483; The City of Quebec v. The Queen[23].\nThe doctrine of common employment is no defence in the Province of Quebec; B\u00e9langer v. Riopel[24]; Dupont v. Quebec Steamship Co.[25]; The Queen v. Filion (2).\nHer Majesty cannot be relieved of any responsibility by any notice, condition or declaration; R. S. C. ch. 38, sec. 50; nor by contract even if there had been one. In the present instance, the right of action by the suppliant did not arise as a representative of her deceased husband, but is specially given to her independently, on account of his death, by Art. 1056 C. C, as there had been no indemnity or satisfaction to deceased in his lifetime. This was the ruling in Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[26]. and in Robertson v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[27], there was an express contract between the parties. See also Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Vogel[28]; Lavoie v. The Queen[29]; Farmer v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[30] per MacMahon J. at page 307, and Art. 1676 C. C. Contracts against such liability are against public policy; Roach v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[31]. The decision of this court in the Vogel Case[32] is binding; see Ross v. The Queen[33], referring to The Queen v. McGreevy[34].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014We are all of opinion that this appeal must be allowed. The Crown has admitted that the suppliant's husband lost his life by the negligence of persons in the employ of the Crown upon the Intercolonial Railway. This court has already held that the law of Quebec from which we must take our rule of decision in this case does not recognise the defence of common employment which prevails in English law. There is no use in referring to authorities on this point as we are bound by our previous decisions regarding it. The Queen v. Filion[35]. Therefore unless the suppliant's husband had so contracted with the Crown as to relieve it from responsibility for his death by reason of the negligence of the servants of the Crown the judgment in favour of the suppliant now under appeal ought to be maintained.\nThat a workman may so contract with his employer as to exonerate the latter from liability for negligence for which the former would otherwise be entitled to recover damages cannot be disputed. Further that such a renunciation would be a sufficient answer to an action under Lord Campbell's Act is conclusively settled by authority. Griffiths v. Earl of Dudley[36]. That the action given by Art. 1056 C. C. is merely an embodiment in the Civil Code, of the action which had previously been given by a statute of Canada re-enacting Lord Campbell's Act is too plain to require any demonstration and nothing in the judgment of the judicial committee in Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[37] controverts this proposition. It would follow therefore that the suppliant's husband by becoming a member of the Intercolonial Railway Relief and Assurance Association and thereby assenting to its rules and to the arrangement by which the Crown contributed $6,000 annually to the funds of the association, in consideration of which the association on behalf of its members renounced all claims against the Crown which might arise from the injury or death of any of its members, constituted a complete answer to the suppliant's petition. It must be acknowledged that if the deceased would, if he had survived, have had no claim for damages against the Crown, the suppliant can have none provided we are right in assuming this to be a proceeding to be governed by the law applicable to actions under \"Lord Campbell's Act.\"\nThe Exchequer Court judge has, however, held that section 50 of the Government Railways Act is an answer to the defence founded on the agreement with the association.\nThat section is as follows:\nHer Majesty shall not be relieved from liability by any notice, condition or declaration in the event of any damage arising from any negligence, omission or default of any officer, employee or servant of the minister; nor shall any officer, employee or servant be relieved from liability by any notice, condition or declaration, if the damage arises from his negligence or omission.\nThe learned judge of the Exchequer Court relies upon the case of the Grand Trunk Railway Co. of Canada v. Vogel[38] as placing a construction upon this section conclusive in favour of the suppliant. Vogel's Case (2) was an action against the railway company for damages caused by the negligence of the servants of the company in their capacity as common carriers of horses, and it was held that a clause in the Railway Act in similar terms to this did away with the effect of an agreement which the owner of the horses had signed and by which he had renounced his right to claim compensation for damages caused by the negligence of the servants of the company. For the reasons I gave in Vogel's Case[39] I am of opinion that a wrong construction of the clause in question in that case prevailed by the majority of a single voice. The terms of the clause in question in the Railway Acts were taken from the English Carriers Acts and were intended only to preclude the right of carriers by unilateral notices, declarations or conditions to which the owners of goods had not become expressly parties to exclude their liability as carriers. And it was not meant to apply to contracts entered into between the railway carrier and the persons whose goods were carried. It certainly had not in the Railway Acts any application to the case of passengers or employees but was restricted to the case of goods traffic.\nSince the case of Robertson v. The Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[40] it would seem that Vogel's Case (1) can scarcely be considered as a binding authority; at all events I should not hesitate to reconsider it if a similar question arose.\nThere would seem to be good grounds for saying that as the clause in the Railway Act from which this section 50 of the Government Railways Act is borrowed, applied only to responsibility incurred in the carriage of goods, this section must also be so restricted. Be that as it may, however, I am of opinion that this, not being a case in its facts similar to Vogel's Case (1), we are free to construe section 50 independently of its authority and so doing I can come to no other conclusion than that these words \"notice, condition or declaration\" do not include a contract or agreement by which a servant employed on the railway has renounced his right to claim damages from the Crown in the event of injury from the negligence of his fellow servants. I need not repeat the reasoning I used in Vogel's Case[41]; shortly it is that the words \"notice\" and \"declaration\" can only apply to the unilateral act of the party giving the notice or making the declaration, and the meaning of the word \"condition\" by itself of doubtful import is determined to refer only to a unilateral proceeding by the words which immediately precede and follow it. This and the history of the legislation as regards common carriers in which these words were first used convince me that they do not apply in a case like the present. I would also refer to the late case of Glengoil Steamship Co. v. Pilkington[42], decided in this court in my absence, but in which i entirely agree.\nThe appeal must be allowed and the petition of right dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

App. R. 78), and that of Rose J. at the trial (29 O.R. 75), that a parol agreement for the sale of the premises, though not enforceable under the Statute of Frauds, was a \u201cdisposition\u201d of the same under said provision entitling the lessor to give the notice to vacate.\nHeld, further that the lessor having, in good faith, represented that he had sold the property, with reasonable grounds for believing so, there was no fraudulent misrepresentation entitling the lessee to damages even if no sale within the meaning of the provision had actually been made, nor was there any eviction or disturbance constituting a breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming by an equal division of opinion the judgment of Mr. Justice Rose at the trial[2] in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe following are the material facts of the case as stated by Mr. Justice Osler, in giving judgment in the Court of Appeal. The plaintiffs on the 12th November, 1896, leased from the defendant certain flats or rooms in a large factory building for the term of three years and two months from the 1st December, 1896. Their lease is expressed to be made in pursuance of the Act respecting short forms of leases, and contains the usual covenant for quiet enjoyment and also the following proviso:\n\u201cProvided that in the event of the lessor disposing of the factory the lessees will vacate the premises if necessary on receiving six months\u2019 notice, or a bonus of $350.\u201d\nIt was very much to the defendant\u2019s interest that he should entirely get rid of the factory, which was a damnosa hereditas, although as regards the parts leased to the plaintiffs there is no doubt that the rent was a profitable one.\nIn December of the same year, 1896, the defendant was negotiating an arrangement with a person named Gardner, and, on the 31st of that month, having as he thought brought it to a conclusion, except that it was not finally reduced to writing, he gave the plaintiffs the following notice:\u2014\u201cAs I have disposed of my interests in the factory premises I beg to notify you that you will be required to vacate that portion of the premises occupied by your firm on or before the 1st of July, 1897.\u201d\nIn point of fact the agreement the parties were negotiating was not finally settled and signed until the 11th January, 1897. As then signed it was, however, one similar to that which defendant supposed he had secured on the 31st December, though with some unimportant variations in the terms. In substance it provided that Gardner was to manage the factory for a year (apparently without any direct compensation), until the 1st January, 1898. Defendant was to advance $1,000 for repairs and improvements to be expended by Gardner under his directions. Gardner was to use every effort to get tenants at the highest rents. These rents were to be paid to and to be the defendant\u2019s property. The leases were to be in his name and the tenants his tenants. If at any time during the year the income exceeded the expenditure, Gardner had the right to require Lumbers to grant him a sub-lease of the factory for the residue of the term, less one day, for which Lumbers himself held it. And if on the 1st of January, 1898, the same state of affairs existed and from the nature of the existing tenancies it should appear probable that it would continue for three months longer, Lumbers had the right to require Gardner, and the latter was bound, to accept a similar lease, and he was also to have the option, at any time during the currency of the proposed tenancy, to purchase the lease from the Land Security Company to his lessor.\nSome time during the month of January, 1897, the plaintiffs consulted their solicitor to know if it would be wise for them to remain and let the defendant prove his sale, and were advised not to do so lest they might be sued for damages. Then they applied to defendant to know if they might be permitted to move at any time, as the six months would expire at a very inconvenient time for them, and they addressed Gardner on the same subject, who wished them to move at once. Lumbers, at their instance, wrote the letter of the 22nd January, 1897. \u201cIn reference to the notice I gave you to vacate on the 30th June next, I understand you wished me to state that in the event of your wishing to move previous to the time stated that you may be relieved of the liability to pay rent after the premises are vacated, to which proposition I reply that when I disposed of the premises I had the option to, and that I availed myself of the former course and gave you the six months\u2019 notice, and my settlement with Mr. Gardner, to whom I sold the property, was completed with the calculation that you would remain in possession and pay me the rent of same for the six months. However,\u201d etc.,\u2014and then the defendant goes on to say that they may vacate the premises at the end of any month, giving one month\u2019s notice and paying rent up to the date of leaving.\nTo this the plaintiffs, who had in the meantime consulted their solicitor, as above stated, replied on the 29th January:\u2014\u201cIn reply to your two notices, December 30th and January 22nd, would say it is very inconvenient for us to move at present as our stock is very large, and as June is our busy month and we could not move. However, we have no option in the matter as you say you have sold property, so we hereby notify you that we will vacate our present premises the end of February, 1897, under protest, as we can find no sale registered.\u201d\nPlaintiffs finished moving into other premises on the 28th February, 1897, and on the following day their solicitor wrote to defendant claiming damages for loss sustained by fraudulent misrepresentations, stating that it had recently come to their knowledge that no sale or disposition had in reality been made by him, and that he had deceived the plaintiffs by representing that it had and had caused them to surrender their lease and move out at great loss to themselves.\nOn the 3rd of March this action was commenced. It was launched and tried out as an action of deceit, but the learned trial judge, while not expressly deciding that it was not maintainable on that ground, held that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover as for a breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment and gave judgment on that ground, with leave to the plaintiffs to amend their statement of claim.\nWatson Q.C. for the appellant. There was no misrepresentation entitling plaintiff to damages. Derry v. Peek[3]. No action lies for innocent misrepresentation. Cowling v. Dickson[4]; White v. Sage[5]; Glasier v. Rolls[6].\nThe agreement was a disposition of the property under the provision in the lease. Elston v. Schilling[7]; Hill v. Sumner[8]; Kennedy v. City of Toronto[9].\nS.H. Blake Q.C. for the respondent. An action lies for non-performance of a legal obligation even in the absence of fraud. Polhill v. Walter[10]; Low v. Bouverie[11]. Moncrief on Fraud and Misrepresentation, p. 137. Physical interference with the lessor\u2019s possession is not necessary to authorize an action for breach of covenant for quiet enjoyment. Edge v. Boileau[12].\nThe agreement for sale was not a \u201cdisposition\u201d of the property under the lease as no interest was parted with. See Astley v. Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway Co.[13]\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Osler, in the Court of Appeal, is prefaced with a statement of the facts which is quite sufficient for the purposes of the present appeal.\nI am of opinion that there was no actionable misrepresentation. So far from it I incline to think that the appellant was strictly accurate in stating in the letter of the 31st December, 1896, that \u201che had disposed of his interests in the factory premises.\u201d At that time he had according to the evidence entered into an agreement for the sale to Gardner, which though not reduced to writing and therefore not enforceable by action as between the parties by reason of non-compliance with the Statute of Frauds, was notwithstanding a completed and concluded contract. This agreement, with a few alterations of a non-essential character, was afterwards embodied in the written instrument of the 11th of January, 1897, signed by the parties. If, on the 31st of December, 1896, there was a concluded agreement, though one resting in parol only, I think it entitled the appellant to give the notice which he had the power of giving under the proviso in the lease to the respondents.\nThe agreement was clearly a disposition of the property; it was in terms and in substance and reality a sale of the whole leasehold interest which he had in the factory of which the respondents\u2019 premises formed part. That it was not binding between the parties by reason of the Statute of Frauds did not, in my judgment, make the appellant guilty of fraud or false representation, or what may be called a constructive eviction of his lessee, when he denominated it a \u201cdisposition.\u201d The appellant wrote this letter himself and he cannot be supposed to have had knowledge of the technical or legal effect of his agreement, or of the provisions of the Statute of Frauds; he believed he had sold his leasehold interest in the property and in good faith gave the notice. Moreover, the agreement constituted a contract, although being within the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds it could not be enforced as such in an action brought by either of the parties to it until it was put into writing. The statute does not say that the contract by parol shall be void, but that \u201cno action shall be brought\u201d to enforce it, without writing. The writing is not required as one of the solemnities of the contract but merely as evidence against the other party to it, and the writing sufficient to prove it may be signed after the agreement is made at any time before action brought. Lucas v. Dixon[14]; Maddison v. Alderson[15], per Lord Blackburn. I am not prepared to say that any writing was necessary to enable the appellant to prove the existence of this agreement in such an action as the present for purposes having nothing to do with the enforcement of the contract, but altogether collateral to it. Certainly the words of the 4th section of the statute do not require a writing for such a purpose as this.\nThen if this is not sufficient I entirely agree in the opinions of the trial judge as to fraud, and those of Mr. Justice Osler and Mr. Justice Maclennan in the Court of Appeal. I fail to see that it was open to the learned Chief Justice to place his judgment on the grounds he has rested it on in the present state of the record by which the respondent\u2019s action is under the amendment directed at the trial, one for breach of covenant for quiet enjoyment, and not as originally one for fraudulent misrepresentation. But assuming the respondents to be still entitled even against the finding of the trial judge and after having accepted the amendment to fall back on their original complaint, I am clear that there was here no fraudulent misrepresentation entitling the respondents to damages.\nThe representation was made in good faith with reasonable grounds for believing it and making it, it was certainly not false, to the knowledge of the appel- lant, which alone would be enough to entitle it to be characterised as innocent. Moreover, it was not acted upon by the respondents in such a way as to entitle them to maintain an action even if it had been false and fraudulent. As Mr. Justice Osler has shown, the appellant\u2019s assertion that he had disposed of the property was really not the cause of the abandonment of possession by the respondents. The possession was surrendered under an agreement between the respondents and the appellant, by which for a valuable consideration the respondents gave up the lease. It could not therefore have been said that the immediate cause of the respondents\u2019 going out of possession was the appellant\u2019s statement. In every action of this kind it is essential to show that the representation of the defendant was one which he knew to be false, and moreover was one dans locum injuri\u0153. In making out these essentials the respondents utterly failed. The learned judge who tried the case without a jury thus found, as he states in his judgment:\nI do not however find that the defendant intentionally, wilfully or maliciously misled the plaintiff. I think he was acting upon what he believed to be his rights, and was acting in good faith in the sense of doing what he did to advance his own interests in accordance with what he believed to be his rights under the proviso. I therefore cannot find any false and fraudulent representation to the plaintiff.\nI think this finding was entirely correct upon the evidence.\nThen to turn to the other causes of action under the amendment of the complaint permitted by the learned judge, viz., that converting the action for fraudulent misrepresentation into one for breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment. The learned trial judge proceeded exclusively upon this. Mr. Justice Maclennan\u2019s judgment shows, I think, by unanswerable reasoning the fallacy of the original judgment. In my view there was no eviction or disturbance here, for the reason that the appellant was justified in giving the notice, as I have before stated, upon the other, branch of the case. It cannot be said that any decided case has ever gone to the extent to which the learned trial judge went in holding the letter of the 31st December, 1896, a breach of the covenant in question. The most that can be said of it, even if we hold it to have been unwarranted by the facts, is that it was premature, as having been eleven days too soon. Could it be said, as is well put by Mr. Justice Maclennan, that the covenant was broken by a lessor who having a right to put an end to the term gave a notice a single day too late which led to the tenant evacuating the premises. I should like to see a case so deciding before I acted on any such proposition. In my view there was no eviction in any view of the case; the respondents chose to act upon the notice and they cannot now complain or call that an eviction or disturbance of possession in which they acquiesced. Moreover, as Mr. Justice Osler demonstrates, the surrender of possession here is to be ascribed to an agreement for which the respondents received valuable consideration and in respect of which they cannot put the appellant back in his original position, and do not indeed offer or pretend to be able to do so; therefore it is perfectly justifiable to say that the respondents acquiesced in what they now call wrongful eviction. The action in either aspect of it wholly fails.\nThe appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed with costs to the appellant in this court as well as in the other courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Watson, Smoke & Masten.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Pinkerton & Cooke.\n[1] 26 Ont.

William Callahan subsequently located the \"Cody\" and \"Joker\" fraction claims whereupon the defendant claimed that the \"Cube lode\" covered a part of the ground on which the \"Cody\" and \"Joker\" fractions were located. William Callaghan then brought an \"adverse action\" under the British Columbia Mining Act, R.S.B. C. ch. 135. At the trial the plaintiff's action was dismissed, the trial judge holding that a certificate recorded by Coplen of work done on the ground in dispute made his title thereto perfect under section 28 of said Act which reads as follows :\n\" 28. Upon any disputes as to the title to any mineral claim no irregularity happening previous to the date of record of the last certificate of work shall affect the title thereto, and it shall be assumed that up to that date the title to such claim was perfect except upon suit by the Attorney-General based upon fraud.\"\nThe irregularity in the case was as to the recorded description of the \" Cube lode \" claim the defendant alleging that the survey was erroneous and the direction of the side line, which was given as south-easterly should have been north-easterly.\nThe defendant's certificate of works was recorded before Callahan's.\nThe judgment of the trial judge was reversed by the court en banc and judgment ordered to be entered for the plaintiff with costs. The defendant then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBefore the appeal to the court en banc the plaintiff William Callahan died and the action was revived in the name of his executor.\nAylesworth Q.C. for the appellant.\nSir Charles Hibbert Tupper Q.C for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by;\nGWYNNE J.\u2014That the description of the \" Cube lode\" claim as recorded by the appellant does not precisely conform to the provisions of the statute of British Columbia in force in that behalf is not disputed. The evidence indeed leaves no doubt in the matter, and it is in fact admitted. The only question therefore which, as it appears to me, is at all necessary to be decided in the present appeal is whether the deviation from the prescribed description was calculated to mislead, and did in fact mislead, William Callahan, now deceased, of whose estate the respondent is administrator, when subsequently recording the \" Cody\" and \"Joker\" fractions claims located by him on behalf of persons whose title was duly transferred to him in his life time. The \" Cody\" and \"Joker\" fractions claims as recorded cover portions of the \"Cube lode\" claim as claimed now by the appellant, but do not touch the \" Cube lode\" claim according to the description as recorded. The whole contention of the appellant is that all objection to the defect in his recorded description of the \" Cube lode\" claim is removed by his certificates of work done by force of sec. 28 of ch. 135, Revised Statutes of British Columbia ; but whatever effect that contention might be entitled to in an action between the appellant and the Provincial Government, it has no application here where the contest is solely between the appellant and the respondent, in which the sole question is whether the owner of the \" Cody\" and \" Joker\" fractions claims as recorded have not by reason of the error in the \" Cube lode\" claim as recorded, acquired superior right to the claim of the appellant to so much of the land covered by the records of the \"Cody\" and \"Joker\" claims as the appellant asserts claim to as part of the \" Cube lode\" claim as now claimed by him, although such land is not within the description of the \" Cube lode\" claim as recorded. That the error in the description of the \" Cube lode\" claim as recorded was calculated to mislead and that in point of fact, the \" Cody\" and \" Joker\" fractions claims were located and recorded as they were by reason of such misleading error, have been found as facts by the learned judge who tried the case, and such his finding is well supported by the evidence, apart altogether from any question of fraud in any person whomsoever. The appeal, therefore, must be dismissed with costs.\nThe Chief Justice was prevented by illness from taking part in the judgment.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the Appellant: Martin & Deacon.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Tapper, Peters & Gilmour.\n[1] 6 B.

The facts giving rise to the litigation are fully set out in the judgment of the court.\nPurdom for the appellant referred to Parker v. Elliott[2]; Gage v. Bates[3]; Attorney General v. Perry[4]; Powers v. Bathurst[5]. Hall on the Sea Shore, (2 ed.) pp. 156-184.\nGlenn for the respondent cited Ackroyd v. Smith[6]; Skull v. Glenister[7]; Telfer v. Jacobs[8]; Dillon on Municipal Corporations (4 ed.) p. 751.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The respondent, who is the plaintiff in the action, is seized in fee of part of lot no. 1 in the first concession of the Township of Yarmouth, fronting on Lake Erie. This lot extends to the water\u2019s edge. The original grant from the Crown of lots nos. 1 and 2, in the first concession, and of lot no. 1, in the second concession of Yarmouth, made on the 19th of September, 1804, to John Bostwick, thus described the lands granted:\nCommencing in front upon Lake Erie, in the limit between the Township of Yarmouth and Southwold at the south-west corner of the said lot no. 1, in the first concession. Then north one hundred and fifty-nine chains more or less, to the allowance for road between the second and third concession, then east 25 chains 53 links more or less, to the limit between lots 1 and 2, then south 80 chains more or less, to the rear of the first concession, then east 25 chains 53 links to the limit between lots Nos. 2 and 3, then south to Lake Erie, then westerly along the water\u2019s edge to the place of beginning, containing 600 acres, more or less, with allowance for road.\nUpon part of lot no. 1, upon which there is now the village of Port Stanley, the respondent has laid out ranges of village lots which are shown upon a registered plan (no. 177) which has been put in evidence. These lots do not extend to the waters of the lake, though they front in that direction; between them and the water\u2019s edge there is now a strip of beach. At the time of the original grant by the Crown this beach did not exist. The lakeward boundary was then a bluff or cliff, the foot of which was washed by the waters of the lake. This appears from the map of the original survey produced from the Crown Lands Office, from which it also appears that there was no allowance for road between the southern boundary of the lot and the water. Until recently this bluff descending to the water\u2019s edge remained as the southern limit of the lot, but within a few years the beach already mentioned has been formed by a sort of accretion partly by the subsidence of the lake and partly by the crumbling away of the cliff or bank. One of the ranges of village lots laid out by the respondent consists of seven lots numbered from the east, commencing at the boundary line between township lots nos. 1 and 2. Some distance to the east of township lot no. 1, and upon township lot no. 2, a range of building lots have been laid out on township lot no. 2. These front towards the lake, and there are some fifteen or twenty cottages adapted for summer residences erected upon them. This locality is known as Orchard Beach. The appellant is the owner of one of these Orchard Beach residences, and has for a number of years occupied it during the summer months. A convenient way for the Orchard Beach residents to reach the village of Port Stanley, the railway station and steamboat wharf, is to pass along the beach in front of the respondent\u2019s lots westerly until Main street in the village is reached. In the summer of 1897, the appellant and his family were in the habit of making use of the beach in front of the respondent\u2019s property in the manner and for the purposes mentioned, and being warned to desist did not do so, but persisted in using and claimed the right to use the beach as a way to and from the premises of the appellant at Orchard Beach.\nThis action was thereupon brought on the 10th of August, 1897, alleging that the appellant had trespassed on the respondent\u2019s property, and claiming that there was no right of way along the beach or across the respondent\u2019s property, and that the appellant be enjoined from committing such trespasses in the future.\nThe appellant in his statement of defence relied upon a right to use the beach as a public way under some general right the nature of which he does not exactly define, but which he states as a right in the public so to use the beach, and for boating and bath- ing purposes also. Further, it is alleged that there was a prescriptive right acquired to the public by long user. Then the claim is set up to a way across and along the beach under a title which the appellant acquired on the 14th of August, 1897, four days after the commencement of the action, to the east half of lot no. 3 in the range of lots belonging to the respondent laid out on township lot no. 1, as shown by plan no. 177 before referred to The whole of lot no. 3 had been sold and conveyed by the respondent to one Frederick Henry, in April, 1897. The conveyance to Henry contained a grant of a right of way to be used as appurtenant to the granted lot no. 3; this grant was as follows:\nTogether with the sole right to erect and use upon the said beach in front of lot no. 3, a private bath and boat house, and the right to use the beach in front of lots 1 to 7, inclusive on said plan for right of way, bathing, boating and all other pastimes in common with the owner and owners of said property as shown in said plan, their tenants and guests residing on said property, reserving to each owner of the said lots 1 to 7 to erect a private bath or boat house on the beach in front of their respective lots, and together with the full right and liberty for the party of the second part, his tenants, servants and guests in common with the other owners of the property mentioned in said plan, to use all the rights of way shown on said plan, and a right of way along said beach from east to west, reserving to John A. Robinson the right to erect fences with gates across said right of way on beach to prevent the public entering thereon.\nThis title is set up in the statement of defence, but the appellant does not counter-claim for any relief or declaration of right founded on it.\nThe action came on for trial before Mr. Justice Meredith, when evidence was given by both parties. The learned judge at the conclusion of the arguments delivered judgment in favour of the respondent, holding that the defence failed on all the points set up, and directed a decree to be entered declaring that the appellant had no right of way across that part of lot no. 1 owned by the respondent otherwise than under the right he might have (if any) under the conveyance from Henry, of the east half of lot no. 3 on plan no. 177, and restraining the appellant from using the way in question except under such right as he might have under the conveyance mentioned.\nAgainst this judgment the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal which unanimously dismissed the appeal for the reasons given in the judgment of the court delivered by Mr. Justice Moss, which are in all respects identical with those upon which the learned trial judge based his judgment.\nThe appellant has now appealed to this court.\nI cannot refrain from saying that it is greatly to be regretted that any appeal should lie on such a trifling matter from the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal constituted by four judges, affirming a previous judgment.\nThe claim to a public right of way along the beach paramount to the rights of the Crown and its grantee is manifestly unsustainable. The grant by the Crown of township lot no. 1 to John Bostwick, the respondent\u2019s predecessor in title, made in 1804, makes the waters of Lake Erie the southern boundary of the land granted and the original survey in the Crown Lands Office shows that there was no reservation of any road or public way along the front of the lot. At the time of the grant the lakeward boundary was the bluff or cliff descending almost perpendicularly to the water, so that the state of the land patented was such that there could be no road or passage along the front. In this state the land remained for many years but lately by gradual accretion or by the recession of the waters of the lake the beach in question has been formed. The land thus formed became in law the property of the owner of the adjoining land. Foster v. Wright[9], judgment of Lindley J. and cases there cited. That the public had no rights across this newly formed beach superior to those of the Crown or those claiming under it is so well established by authority as not to admit of dispute. Blundell v. Catterall[10]; Attorney General v. Chambers[11].\nThe claim to a prescriptive right of user on the part of the general public wholly fails on the evidence for it appears that the beach had not been in existence and consequently there could have been no user for a time sufficiently long to confer such a title; moreover the fact of general user of the beach as a highway since it has in fact existed is controverted by the witnesses called for the respondent.\nThe appellant does not in his pleading set up any dedication by the respondent of a highway along the beach though that claim was put forward both in the Court of Appeal and in the argument at this bar. There is, however, no foundation in fact for such a claim. The only evidence in support of it was that a plank walk had been laid down along the beach by the Municipal Council. This, however, is shown by evidence to have been done by the permission of the respondent and subject to his express reservation of all his rights of property.\nThere only remains to be considered the extent of the appellant\u2019s rights under the conveyance from Henry which was taken by him after the institution of the action and manifestly with a view of supporting his original claim to use the beach as a highway in going to the village from and returning to his house at Orchard Beach on township lot no. 2. That the appellant did not circumscribe his claims under the deed from Henry to such a user as was incidental to his enjoyment as the owner of the east half of lot no. 3 in plan 177, but claimed it as sufficiently extensive to cover for the future similar trespasses to those which he had committed on the respondent\u2019s property before the commencement of the action is made manifest by his own admissions in the witness box contained in the following extract from his deposition:\nMr. Donohue\u2014Q. You bought this land in August? A. Yes.\nQ. And you remained during that whole season? A. Yes.\nQ. Living on lot no. 2? A. Yes, and walked over the sidewalk.\nQ. And continued all that summer to walk over the sidewalk? A. Yes.\nQ. Without any reference whatever to using it for the purposes of lot 3 on the plan?\nHis Lordship\u2014He had no title to lot 3 on the plan.\nMr. Donohue\u2014To witness\u2014Q. Since buying the property you have been walking on the beach just the same as you walked before? A. Yes.\nQ. And your using the beach had no reference to your owning lot 3? A. Not at all.\nQ. It was in order to get back and forward to the place that you lived your trespassing? A. I did not take any notice of the trespassing.\nQ. This alleged trespass consisted in your going from the place you were living on lot 2 to Main street? A. Yes; on Sunday morning.\nQ. And having no reference to lot 3? A. Exactly.\nSuch a contention having regard to the state of the law as established by incontrovertible authorities cannot be maintained.\nThe easement granted to Henry, (and in which the appellant may possibly be entitled to participate as a sub-purchaser from Henry of a portion of the land to which that easement was attached[12],) was in express terms limited to the purposes of lot no. 3. What rights the appellant actually acquired to the enjoyment of this easement as purchaser of part of lot 3 is not a question calling for decision in this action and the learned trial judge has very correctly refused to deal with it and has expressly excepted it in the decree. The question is whether the acquisition of any easement expressly made incidental to the enjoyment of lot no. 3 in plan 177 can be held to confer any rights on the appellant as the owner of a house at Orchard Beach. It manifestly never was in the contemplation of the respondent to confer any such rights on Henry, the appellant\u2019s grantor, and the appellant could derive from Henry no greater rights than the latter had which were limited to the purposes of lot no. 3.\nThat a right of way granted as an easement incidental to a specified property cannot be used by the grantee for the same purposes in respect of any other property is shown by many reported cases of which two cited by the respondent may be particularly referred to as establishing the proposition. In Skull v. Glenister[13] this was one of the questions decided and Erle C.J. says:\nThis right of way was appurtenant to the land demised by the Wheelers to the defendants. The defendants are therefore bound to make use of this way for purposes exclusively connected with their holding of these demised premises.\nIn Ackroyd v. Smith[14] which may be consided the leading case on the point, the question was raised distinctly on demurrer whether the defendant could under a grant of a right of way as incidental to the enjoyment of a particular close make use of this way for his own purposes irrespective altogether of its use in respect of the dominant tenement to which it was originally made appurtenant. The defendant there claimed as an assignee of the right of way from the original grantee. It was held first that the road was granted only for purposes connected with the occupa- tion of the land conveyed and therefore could only be used as connected with that land. It was, however, further determined that even if the original grantee did acquire under the grant a more extensive right, a personal right to use the way irrespective of the land granted, that was a mere personal license which could not be granted or assigned over by the original licensee since there is not known to the law such an interest in land as an easement in gross. The case of Lawton v. Ward[15] shows that the restriction of an easement to the purposes for which it is originally granted is no new law but is an old and well established rule of the law of property. See also Gale on Easements, 7th ed. p. 470.\nThese authorities are decisive in the respondent\u2019s favour. To apply them here we must hold that the original easement granted to Henry was limited to the purposes of the land as an incident to which it was an appurtenance and that the appellant can have no rights greater than those of this grantor. Further, even if there were any colour or pretence for saying that Henry acquired a personal right to the free use of the beach for all purposes and irrespective altogether of lot no. 3, he could not grant over or assign that right to the appellant.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Parke, Purdom & Purdom.\nSolicitors for the respondent: James W.

JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA, APPEAL SIDE.\nMunicipal corporation \u2014Railways\u2014Taxation\u2014By-laws\u2014Construction of statute\u2014Voluntary payment\u2014Action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition\u201429V. c. 57 s, 21 (Can.)\u201429 & 30 V. c. 57 (Can.)\nThe statute, 29 Vict. ch. 57, (Can.), consolidating and amending the Acts and Ordinances incorporating the City of Quebec, by subsection 4 of section 21, authorises the making of by-laws to impose taxes on persons exercising certain callings, a and generally on all trades, manufactories, occupations, business, arts, professions or means of profit, livelihood or gain, whether hereinbefore enumerated or not which now or may hereafter be carried on exercised or in operation in the city; and all persons by whom the same are or may be carried on, exercised or put in operation therein, either on their own account or as agents for others; and on the premises wherein or whereon the same are or may be carried on, exercised or put in operation.\"\nHeld, that the general words of the statute quoted are sufficiently comprehensive to authorise the imposition of a business tax upon railway companies; and, further that the power thus conferred might be validly exercised by the passing of a by-law to impose the tax in the same general terms as those expressed in the statute. Held, per Strong C. J., that where taxes have been paid to a municipal corporation voluntarily and with knowledge of the state of the law and the circumstances under which the tax was imposed no action can lie to recover the money so paid from the municipality,\nJudgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Q. R. 8 Q. B. 246) affirmed.\nAPPEALS from the judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, appeal side ([1]), reversing the decisions of the Superior Court, District of Quebec and dismissing the respective actions with costs.\nThe Act consolidating the statutes respecting the incorporation of the City of Quebec ([2]) by its twenty-first section empowers the city council to levy taxes on persons and companies exercising a number of trades, occupations and callings which are specially enumerated in the fourth sub-section of the section referred to, and also, g generally on all trades, manufactories, occupations, business, arts, professions or means of profit livelihood or gain \" whether therein-before enumerated or not, which might at the time of the passing of the Act or thereafter \"be carried on exercised or in operation in the city; on all persons by whom the same are or may be carried on exercised or put in operation therein either on their own account or as agents for others, and on the premises wherein or Whereon the same are or may be carried on exercised or put in operation.\" The city council passed a by-law under the provisions of the Act imposing taxes upon the various callings therein enumerated, and also, in general terms, using the phraseology of the Act as quoted, on all trades, manufactures, occupations, business, arts and professions which then or thereafter might be carried on or exercised in the city. At that time there were no railways within the city limits, but the Grand Trunk Railway Company occupied within the city certain wharves and premises for the purpose of receiving and delivering freight, issuing passenger tickets and receiving and delivering bag-gage, and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company subsequently entered the city and carried on business there in the usual manner. Although railway companies were not mentioned in the by-law the companies were, from the time they commenced to do business in the city included in the assessment rolls as liable for the business tax imposed by the by-law and, upon the advice of counsel the companies paid the taxes so imposed for a number of years. They now seek to recover the taxes so paid as moneys illegally collected by the city and paid by them under misapprehension and without cause,\nThe companies respectively recovered judgments against the city in the Superior Court, but these judgments were reversed upon appeal by the Court of Queen's Bench, and the present appeals ask for the restoration of the judgments rendered in the trial court.\nThe appeals were heard together by consent of parties.\nStuart Q.C. for the appellants. The statute, 29 Vict. ch. 57 does not authorise the imposition of any tax on railway companies, which are not to be found in the enumeration of sub-section 4 of sec. 21 nor can they be included, by any sound rule of interpretation, in the general expressions which follow such enumeration. None of the subsequent statutes amending the above or ratifying what was done under it, conferred this power,\nEven if the City of Quebec had had the power, it did not in the by-law impose a business tax on the railway companies neither of which were then being operated within the city limits. A municipality cannot tax a specific business, nor any class of citizens in any but express language, clearly designating it. Words of general purport will not suffice. See Cooley on Taxation, pp. 887 and 574, as to municipal powers to tax; Acer v. DeMontigny ([3]); McManamy v. City of Sherbrooke ([4]).\nThe payment to the city treasurer was made through error and was not due. The case is stronger than condiclio indebiti it is conduction sine caus\u00e2. The assessments were not only voidable, they were radically and absolutely null and void. On the appellants right to recover see arts. 1047 1140 C. C.; arts. 1235 1376 C. N.; 4 Aubry & Rau, pp. 727, 739 (442, 442 bis); Pothier, Obligations, n. 42; Leprohon v.

Gagnon ([8]) city of Montreal v. Walker ([9]); corporation of Quebec v. Caron ([10]); Dubois v. Corporation d'Acton-Vale ([11]); Bell Telephone Co. v. Town of Summerlea ([12]).\nSir A. P. Pelletier Q.C. for the respondent. The omission of any specific reference to railway cornpones in the statutes, as well as in the by-law may be accounted for by the fact well known to all parties that there were then no railways entering the city, but the general words used both in the statutes and in the by-law are wide enough to include companies carrying on the business of railway carriers, and contain no exceptions in their favour The statutes passed by the old Province of Canada are clearly intra vires and sufficient to authorise the business tax\" levied and the by-law validly imposes the tax by using the general terms of the Act, verbatim. The railway companies suffered no injustice. The same business tax is imposed upon all other traders, who might complain if the appellants were not taxed. The appellants have no right to exemption or discrimination in their favour. As to the payment, it was voluntarily made with full knowledge of the facts and there was no mistake of law. The evidence shows that both appelants paid the tax because their legal advisers had certified it as correct according to the by-law and the law authorising it and considered the tax legally imposed and due. The action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition lies only in case of payment sine caus\u00e2. Pothier (ed. Bugnet) vol 5, no. 142, 157; Bain v. City of Montreal ([13]); Grantham V.

Jur., vo. \" R\u00e9p\u00e9tition de lindu,\" no. 54; 20 Laurent, no. 353.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014We are all of opinion that\nthere is no error in the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, and that this appeal must be dismissed.\nThe general words of the 4th subsection of section\n21 of 29 Vict. cap. 57 are sufficiently comprehensive to authorise the city to impose the tax known as \u201cthe business tax\u201d upon railway companies, although such companies are not specifically mentioned in the enactment.\nThe French version of the Act is as follows:\nEt g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sur tous commerces, manufactures, occupations, affaires, arts, professions, ou moyens de profit ou de subsistance, qu'ils-soient \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s ci-dessus ou non qui sont maintenant ou qui seront. par la suite faits, exerc\u00e9s ou en op\u00e9ration dans Ia dite cite, pour eux-m\u00eames ou comme agents pour d'autres, et sur toutes personnes par qui ils peuvent \u00eatre ou seront faits, exerc\u00e9s ou mis en op\u00e9ration dans la dite cite au taux de trentes piastres par cheque quatre cents piastres de la valeur annuellement cotis\u00e9e du local occup\u00e9 par toute telle personne ou soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de personnes pour les fins susmentionn\u00e9es, et \u00e0 raison du m\u00eame taux pour chaque somme plus grande ou plus petite de la valeur estim\u00e9e comme susdit Pourvu que nulle personne ou soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de personnes ne sera sujette \u00e0 la taxe ci-dessus sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9e pour une occupation ou affaire d\u00e9j\u00e0 assujettie \u00e0 la taxation en vertu de pr\u00e9sent r\u00e8glement, ou pour ou \u00e0 raison de laquelle la dite personne ou soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de personnes est d\u00e9j\u00e0 sp\u00e9cialement tax\u00e9e ou cotis\u00e9e en vertu de ce r\u00e8glement.\nThese general words are manifestly not intended to be interpreted narrowly, and on the principle of the maxim \u201cnoscitur a socials \u201crestricted to trades occupations and business analogous to such as be specifically mentioned. The words \" qu'ils soient enumeres cidessus on non \" indicate this very plainly. The object was to make the law as comprehensive as possible so as to include any business or occupation which might thereafter he established in the City of Quebec, though at the date of the statute unknown there or indeed not followed anywhere. So soon as a new business was established in the city then the power to tax it was to apply. The law would otherwise have been grossly unfair for its effect would have been to exempt persons and companies carrying on a new line of business not expressly mentioned and whose introduction could not have been foreseen. At the time the Act was passed, in 1866, there was no railway company carrying on business in the City of Quebec.\nThen it is further objected that the by-law No. 200 passed on the 27th March, 1867, was illegal by reason of the generality of its terms which are an exact trans-script of those of the statute. It would be sufficient to say in answer to this that if the statute authorised the city to tax railway companies by the general terms used, the city council sufficiently exercised that power when by the same general words they imposed the Lax.\nHowever that may be, the amending Act 29 & 30 Vict. cap. 57, although it leaves the question of the interpretation of the original statute just as it was, and does not furnish any assistance in determining whether railway corporations were included in its general terms; does certainly remove any objection to the bylaw founded on the generality of the terms in which it was expressed.\nThe question therefore is just reduced to the single one whether railway companies were included in the general terms of section 2 of the Act of 1866. As already stated we think they were so included.\nSpeaking for myself alone I am further of opinion that even if the points on the construction of the statute and as to the validity of the by-law were to be decided favourably to the appellant we should still have no alternative but to dismiss the appeal inasmuch as the payments of the taxes of which r\u00e9p\u00e9tition is sought by this action were purely voluntary, made as appears from the depositions in the record with a full knowledge of the state of the law and of all the facts According to my view of the law money so paid for taxes or assessments to municipal corporations cannot be recovered back\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nN0te.Thss judgment also applies to the similar appeal in the case of The Grand Trunk Railway Co v. City of Quebec.\nAppeals dismissd with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Caron, Pentland & Stuart.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Pelletier & Chouinard.\n[1] Q. R. 8 Q.

(1887) ch. 121\u2014Arbitration\u2014Action upon award\u2014River improvements\u2014Detention of logs\u2014Damages.\nWhen logs being floated down a stream are unreasonably detained by reason of others being massed in front of them the owner is entitled to an arbitration under the Saw-logs Driving Act to determine the amount of his damages for such detention and is not restricted to the remedy provided by sec. 3 of that Act, namely, removing the obstruction. Judgment of the Court of Appeal (26 Ont. App. R. 19) reversed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the High Court of Justice, (Rose J.) and dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 action in so far as it was based upon the award in question in the suit.\nThe action was brought to recover $1,376 damages and costs awarded to them in an arbitration under the provisions of \u201cThe Saw-logs Driving Act,\u201d R.S.O. (1887) ch. 121, occasioned by alleged wrongful and unnecessary detention of their saw-logs on the drive in Deer Creek, District of Nipissing, during the season of spring freshets in 1896. The circumstances of the case and questions at issue on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported. Gamble and Dunn for the appellants. This was a public stream and respondents could not interfere with the right appellants\u2019 had to float their logs down it. See Caldwell v. McLaren[2]; Davis v. Winslow[3]; Bearce v. Dudley[4].\nThe new remedy given by sec. 3 does not take away any existing previously, but is only additional.

Mooney[5].\nAylesworth Q.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the reasons given by Mr. Justice King in his written opinion which I have read.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I concur in the reasons of my brothers Gwynne and King.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014By chapter 121 R.S.O. 1887 intituled \u201cAn Act respecting the Driving of Saw-logs and other Timber on Lakes, Rivers, Creeks and Streams,\u201d it is enacted in sec. 3, that\nany person putting or causing to be put into any water in the province, logs for the purpose of floating the same in, upon or down such water, shall make adequate provision and put on a sufficient force of men to break, and shall make all reasonable endeavours to break, jams of such logs and clear the same from the banks and shores of such water with reasonable dispatch and run and drive the same so as not to unnecessarily delay or hinder the removal, floating, running or driving of other logs or unnecessarily obstruct the floating or navigation of such water.\nThen sec. 4 enacts that\nin case of the neglect of any person to comply with the provisions of the preceding section it shall be lawful for any other person or persons desiring to float, run or drive logs in, upon or down such water, and whose logs would be thereby obstructed, to cause such jams to be broken and such logs to be cleared from the banks and shores of such water and to be floated, run and driven in, upon and down such water.\nThen secs. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 provide for cases of logs of several different owners becoming intermixed so as not to be capable of being conveniently separated, and enact that the several owners shall respectively put on a fair proportion of men to break the jams, and that if any should fail to do so the other or others may supply such deficiency and take and retain possession of logs of the one in default to meet the cost of the supplying of such deficiency and provide how the logs so taken possession of may be dealt with. Then sec. 13 enacts that:\nIf it be determined by arbitration as hereinafter provided for, that any person acting under the assumed authority of this Act has without just cause taken possession of or detained, or caused to be taken possession of or detained, logs of another person or has after offer of security which the arbitrators may think should have been accepted, detained such logs, or has through want of reasonable care left logs of another person on the banks or shores or has taken logs of another person beyond the place of their original destination, contrary to the provisions of sections 5, 8 or 11, then such first mentioned person shall pay to such last mentioned person such damages as the arbitrators may determine.\nThen sec. 16 enacts that:\nAll claims, disputes and differences arising under this Act shall be determined by arbitration as hereinafter provided and not by action.\nThen sec. 17 provides for the appointment of arbitrators, by enacting that\nthe person claiming that another person has not complied with the provisions of this Act, or, claiming payment of any charges or expenses under this Act, or claiming a lien on any logs, or claiming damages under sec. 13, shall give to such other person notice in writing stating the substance of the claims made and appointing an arbitrator and calling upon the other person to appoint an arbitrator within ten days after the service of the notice, &c, &c. Then sec. 19 enacts that:\nThe parties may agree that the arbitration shall be by one arbitrator * * or may apply to the judge (of the County Court) or stipendiary magistrate to appoint one.\nThen sec. 20 enacts that:\nThe person on whom a claim is made and notice of arbitration served may at any time before the arbitration is entered upon, or with leave of the arbitrators during the arbitration, give the claimant notice in writing by way of counter-claim, stating the substance of any claim arising under this Act, which such person may have against the claimant, and such counter-claim, unless barred under sec. 27, shall be determined in the arbitration, and an award made with respect thereto.\nThe limitation of claims prescribed by this sec. 27 is that all claims shall be made by a notice in writing under sec. 17, and within one year after the same have arisen, or otherwise they shall be barred.\nThen sec. 25 enacts that the award of the arbitrators or of a sole arbitrator, as the case may be, shall be final and binding upon the parties.\nIn the spring of 1896 the appellants and respondents respectively had logs being driven down a river in the District of Nipissing, in the Province of Ontario, called Deer Creek, in the following order, namely, the respondents had one drive in front and another in the rear of the drive of the appellants. The logs of the appellants\u2019 drive became so intermixed with the logs in the front drive of the respondents that the parties, both assuming to act under the above statute, took measures which resulted in a fracas between the respective parties and their men, and in the detention, as the appellants contend, of a large portion of their logs so that they could not descend the river during the spring freshet, but had to remain therein until the autumn freshet. Upon the 27th June, 1896, the appellants caused a notice to be served upon the respondents in the form required by the statute, to the effect that the appellants claimed from the respondents the sum of five thousand and eleven dollars, being the amount of loss sustained by the appellants in consequence of the detention by the respondents of logs of the appellants in Deer Creek during the months of April and May then last past, and they notified the respondents that they had appointed one John Bourke as their arbitrator, and called upon the respondents to appoint an arbitrator on their behalf within ten days after the service of the said notice upon them. The respondents, in compliance with this notice which was served upon them, caused to be served upon the appellants a notice dated the 3rd of July, 1896, to the effect that they had appointed one Alexander Hamilton as their arbitrator to act with John Bourke as the appellants\u2019 arbitrator in respect of the appellants\u2019 claim; and further, that the respondents counter-claimed from the appellants the sum of four hundred and seventy-four dollars and fifty-three cents, being for a fair proportion of the charges and expenses of breaking the jams and clearing, floating, running, driving, separating, booming and keeping possession of their logs which delayed and hindered the floating of the company\u2019s logs down Deer Creek during the driving season of 1896, and which were intermixed therewith. And the appellants were by the said notice required to take notice\nthat such logs are now lying at the mouth of Deer Creek between the Veuve River and dam no. 1 upon Deer Creek, and that the company claims to take and keep possession of so much of such logs as may be reasonably necessary to satisfy the amount of such proportion of charges, and if satisfactory security be given for the amount of such proportion of charges and expenses possession of the logs will be given up; and further that the company claims from you the sum of ten thousand dollars being the amount of damages and loss sustained by the company in consequence of the detention by you of its logs in Deer Creek during the driving season of 1896, and the further sum of twelve hundred and fifty-one dollars, twenty-five cents loss the company has sustained by reason of your having taken possession of the company\u2019s logs and having carried them past their place of destination and retained possession thereof.\nAfterwards the parties agreed together to substitute John Alphonse Valin, Esquire, Judge of the District Court of the District of Nipissing, as sole arbitrator in the place and stead of the said arbitrators, and they signed and set their respective seals to an agreement to that effect, dated the 24th of July, 1896. On the opening of the arbitration before Judge Valin on the 8th August following a note was taken down and recorded by the said judge in the arbitration proceedings that the agreement and intent of the parties was that Judge Valin was agreed upon and accepted by both parties as sole arbitrator under sec. 19 of the said ch. 121 R.S.O., 1887. This was apparently done to avoid any misconception as to the intent of the parties which might possibly arise upon construction of the terms of the sealed instrument of the 24th July. Judge Valin accordingly proceeded with the arbitration and no objection appears to have been made before him by or on behalf of either of the parties that any of the evidence offered by the other related to a claim such as that now pleaded by the defendants or to any matter not included within the scope of a reference under the statute, and Judge Valin accordingly made his award in the premises and thereby did award, adjudge and finally determine as follows:\n1. That the said Imperial Lumber Company is not entitled to compensation for loss (if any) suffered by said company through its logs being taken past their place of destination by reason of the act or neglect of the said Cockburn & Sons.\n2. That the said Imperial Lumber Company and the said Cockburn & Sons are not entitled to any charge or expense or compensation for work done by either party on the other\u2019s logs.\n3. That the said Cockburn & Sons have sustained damages by reason of the detention of their logs on Deer Creek during the driving season of 1896 by the acts and neglect of the said Imperial Lumber Com- pany to the extent of $1,376, and that the said Imperial Lumber Company is therefore indebted to the said Cockburn & Sons in the sum of $1,376 which said sum I hereby direct the said Imperial Lumber Company to pay to the said Cockburn & Sons at their office at Sturgeon Falls, in the District of Nipissing, on or before the first day October, 1896.\n4. That the said Imperial Lumber Company shall pay to the said Cockburn & Sons, at their said office at Sturgeon Falls, on or before the first day of October, 1896, their costs of and incidental to the submission to arbitration and of the arbitration or reference and of this my award.\nThe above amount not having been paid this action is brought upon the award to recover the amounts thereby awarded, and the only defence to the action which is at all material to be noticed upon this appeal is contained in the following paragraph in the defendants\u2019 statement of defence:\n15. The defendant company denies that the said Joseph Alphonse Valin made any such award of and concerning the said matters as is alleged in the statement of claim, and the defendant company further charges that in the sum of $1,376 mentioned in the said alleged award the said Joseph Valin has included a substantial amount in respect of the delay claimed by the plaintiffs to have been occasioned to them in getting their logs down the said stream by reason of logs of the defendant company being ahead of the plaintiffs\u2019 logs in the said stream, and thereby keeping back or hindering the running and driving of the plaintiffs\u2019 logs down the said creek, and the defendant company charges that no such claim could arise or be made the subject of arbitration under the said Saw\u2011logs Driving Act, and that no such claim was in fact included in the matters intended to be referred to the said Joseph Alphonse Valin.\nAt the trial it was expressly admitted by the defendants\u2019 counsel that this was the sole matter in difference between the parties. Now the whole burthen of establishing the truth of this defence rested upon the defendants, and the sole evidence adduced by them in support of their allegation was that of the arbitrator whom the defendants called and the whole of whose evidence upon the subject appears to have been as follows. He was asked by the defendants\u2019 counsel whether evidence had been given by the plaintiffs in the arbitration before him\nthat the Lumber Company by having their logs ahead of the plaintiffs in the stream were delaying them. Is that it?\nTo which he answered:\nNo, not in that way, the statements made by the witnesses were to this effect, that Doctor Warren (the manager of the defendant company) was not able with his jackladder to take in the logs fast enough to clear the channel and to delay Cockburn\u2019s logs as long as possible, that is one of them.\nThe learned counsel put this further question:\nPerhaps (he said) we can get at the matter in this way, if you can tell me (without telling me any of your reasons) how the award was made up?\nTo this he answered as follows:\nThe amount of the award was made up by twenty-two days of delay at 40 men a day on the average, that was accepted by counsel on both sides, that there would be an average of 40 men for every day, at $1.45 per day.\nThe above is substantially the whole of the evidence upon which the defendants rested for proof of their contention, and that evidence appears to fall far short of establishing the truth of their defence, namely, that part of the damages awarded was for damage occasioned to the plaintiffs by the mere circumstance that the defendants had a drive of logs ahead of the logs of the plaintiffs whose logs were thereby necessarily delayed in floating down the stream without any default of the defendants. The evidence of the arbitrator, on the contrary, appears to me to establish that the plaintiffs made no claim upon any such ground as that now contended for by the defendants, but that the delay complained of by the plaintiffs was occasioned by the acts, default and neglect of the defendants in the manner in which they assumed to exercise the rights which they claimed to be vested in them by the statute, after the occurrence of the jams which would seem to have been constantly taking place, and that it was for such damages so occasioned which the arbitrator called damages for general detention as distinguished from damages occasioned by a special detention of some logs under a false claim by the defendants of a right of lien under the statute. We have not before us the evidence of all the circumstances attending the occurrence of the several jams and of the several acts of the parties in attempting to extricate the logs from them, nor of the duration of the jams and of the efforts of the parties to extricate the logs as the arbitrator had, but there was shown at the trial, and presumably by the defendants themselves, extracts from the evidence given at the arbitration by the manager of the defendant company from which it is apparent that the intermixing of the logs of the respective parties in their course down the river, and the efforts of both parties to extricate them, took place constantly during a long period of time until on the 30th or 31st May the difficulties which had arisen and the conflicts and collisions between the parties and their servants in respect thereof culminated in this, that according to the evidence of the manager of the Imperial Lumber Company, he assumed a right to prevent all the plaintiffs\u2019 logs which were then above a dam in the river from entering a sluice gate therein, whereby logs descended the dam by putting a large boom across the head of the sluice gate and locking it there, and prevented the plaintiffs\u2019 men from removing the boom and so actually detained all of the logs of the plaintiffs above the dam for some days, and gave the plaintiffs notice that the defendants claimed the right to retain in their custody all of the logs of the plaintiffs so detained above the dam for a lien thereon under the statute; and we see further by the defendants\u2019 notice of the 3rd of July, 1896, that they then claimed to have in their custody certain of the plaintiffs\u2019 logs which had floated down the dam, and which were then said to be in the river between its mouth into Veuve River and the dam which they claimed to hold for a lien thereon under the statute. The learned trial judge found as a fact upon the material before him that the general detention and detention under alleged lien (of which the arbitrator in his evidence had spoken), were both during the months of April and May, and that what was done on the 1st of June was but a continuation of the assertion of the right of lien which the defendants had made, and that the arbitrator had acted clearly within the scope of a reference as provided for by the statute, and accordingly he rendered judgment for the plaintiffs for the amount of the award, with interest and costs. The Court of Appeal for Ontario reversed this judgment and dismissed the action upon the award with costs, from which judgment the plaintiffs have appealed to this court.\nNow it is to be observed that in the defendants\u2019 statement of defence, paragraph 15, and in all the courts below and in this court, the whole ground of defence to the action on the award relied on by the defendants was an allegation that the arbitrator in his award had allowed to the plaintiffs damages for delay in getting their logs down the stream, which delay was occasioned by the mere fact of defendants\u2019 logs being ahead of those of the plaintiffs, which latter were thus necessarily delayed. In my opinion the defendants have wholly failed to establish this their contention.\nAlthough we have not before us all the evidence which the arbitrator had before him, we have enough, I think, to show that all the claims, disputes and dif- ferences which appear to have been numerous between the parties while their logs were floating down the stream, and the claims made by the plaintiffs before the arbitrator, were in respect of damages suffered by the plaintiffs by reason of the manner in which the defendants assumed to act in their assertion of the authority of the statute, all of which claims, disputes and differences were claims, disputes and differences under the statute within the meaning of section 16, and so were recoverable by arbitration and an award under the statute. The arbitrator, in his evidence in the action, said that the plaintiffs had presented no claim before him for damages by delay occasioned by the cause as pleaded by the defendants, and as throughout the action was contended by them. The fact that the defendants never during the progress of the arbitration nor until an award was made against them claimed that any such or any claim outside of the scope of an arbitration under the statute was presented before the arbitrator by the plaintiffs, seems to afford confirmation of this evidence of the arbitrator if any confirmation was necessary, and the general detention spoken of by the arbitrator is susceptible of an intelligible meaning by reference to the numerous detentions claimed to have arisen during the progress of the logs down the stream from the manner in which the defendants assumed to act in assertion of authority under the statute, without attributing it to mere delay from the clause pleaded by the defendants and relied upon by them. I can see nothing in the evidence to support a contention that the arbitrator allowed, or that the plaintiffs claimed before him, damages for any delay so occasioned, and the defendants having failed to establish the only defence offered by them to the validity of the award the appeal must be allowed with costs and the judgment of the plaintiffs for the full amount of the award and interest and costs, be restored.\nKING J.\u2014The action was brought by the present appellants to recover a sum of $1,376 awarded in an arbitration under the provisions of the \u201cSaw-logs Driving Act\u201d (R.S.O. [1887], c. 121.) The appeal is from a judgment of the Court of Appeal reversing a judgment of Rose J. who had maintained the action. The substantial question arises upon the construction of the Act, the material clauses of which are the following:\nSec. 3. Any person putting or causing to be put into any water in this province logs for the purpose of floating the same in, upon or down such water, shall make adequate provisions and put on a sufficient force of men to break, and shall make all reasonable \u00e9ndavours to break, jams of such logs, and clear the same from the banks and shores of such waters with reasonable despatch, and run and drive the same so as not to unnecessarily delay or hinder the removal, floating, running or driving of other logs, or unnecessarily obstruct the floating or navigation of such water.\nSec. 4. In case of the neglect of any person to comply with the provisions of the preceding section, it shall be lawful for any other person or persons desiring to float, run or drive logs in, upon or down such water, and whose logs would be thereby obstructed, to cause such jams to be broken, and such logs to be cleared from the banks and shores of such water and to be floated, run and driven in, upon and down such water.\nSec. 5. The person or persons causing such jams to be broken, or such logs to be cleared, floated, run or driven pursuant to the last preceding section shall do the same with reasonable economy and despatch, and shall take reasonable care not to leave logs on the bank or shores, and shall have a lien upon the logs in the jam, or so cleared, floated, run or driven for the reasonable charges and expenses of breaking the jams, and the clearing, floating, running, driving, booming and keeping possession of such logs and may take and keep possession of such logs or so much thereof as may be reasonably necessary to satisfy the amount of such charges and expenses pending the decision by arbitration as hereinafter provided for. The person taking possession of logs under this section shall use all reasonable care not to take such logs beyond the place of their original desti- nation, if known, but may securely boom and keep possession of the same at or above such place. The owner or person controlling such logs, if known, shall be forthwith notified of their whereabouts and, if satisfactory security be given for the amount of such charges and expenses, possession of the logs shall be given up.\nThen follow analogous provisions for the driving in common of logs which have become so intermixed that they cannot be conveniently separated, and for the separation of intermixed logs which are capable of being so separated. (secs. 6-11.)\nSection 13 provides for the case where persons assuming to exercise the authority given by the Act, act irregularly or in excess of such authority. It provides that:\nIf it be determined by arbitration, as hereinafter provided for, that any person acting under the assumed authority of this Act has, without just cause, taken possession of, or detained, or caused to be taken possession of or detained, logs of another person, or has, after offer of security which the arbitrators may think should have been accepted, detained such logs, or has, through want of reasonable care, left logs of another person on the banks or shores, or has taken logs of another person beyond the place of their original destination contrary to the provisions of sections 5, 8 or 11, then such first mentioned person shall pay to such last mentioned person such damages as the arbitrators may determine.\nSec. 16 declares that:\nAll claims, disputes and differences arising under this Act shall be determined by arbitration as hereinafter provided, and not by action.\nAnd then sec. 17 provides that:\nThe person claiming that another person has not complied with the provisions of this Act, or claiming payment of any charges or expenses under this Act, or claiming a lien upon any logs, or claiming damages under section 13, shall give to such other person notice in writing stating the substance of the claims made and appointing an arbitrator and calling upon such other person to appoint an arbitrator within ten days after the service of the notice.\nProvision is then made for appointment of a second arbitrator in case the person notified does not appoint, and also, (in either event), for the appointment of a third arbitrator.\nSec. 19 provides that the parties may agree that a single arbitrator may determine the matter. And sec. 20 provides for a counterclaim by the person on whom the original claim was made.\nThe plaintiffs and defendants were the owners of timber limits on a stream called Deer Creek, in the District of Nipissing, and in the spring of 1896 were engaged in driving saw-logs down it. Disputes arose between them in carrying on their respective driving operations, and notices of claim and counterclaim were given under the arbitration provisions of the Act. The plaintiffs claimed $5,011.25 as being the amount of loss sustained in consequence of the detention by defendants of the logs in Deer Creek during the months of April and May, and notified defendants of the arbitrator appointed by them, and requested them to appoint an arbitrator. The defendants thereupon notified plaintiff that they had appointed a certain person to act as arbitrator in respect of the claim served by plaintiff, and gave notice of counterclaim under the three heads of proportion of expenses for driving intermixed logs\u2014damages for detention of defendants\u2019 logs by plaintiffs and damages sustained for carrying defendants\u2019 logs past their place of destination.\nA third arbitrator was appointed, but subsequently the parties agreed that Mr. Valin, the judge of the District Court of Nipissing, should be the sole arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator, after hearing the parties, adjudged that\nthe said Cockburn has sustained damages by reason of the detention of their logs in Deer Creek during the driving season of 1896 by the act and neglect of the Imperial Lumber Company to the extent of $1,376, and awarded that this sum be paid by defendants to the plaintiffs in respect thereof.\nThe arbitrator was examined at the trial and stated that, of the $1,376, the sum of $1,276 was for the unreasonable detention of plaintiff\u2019s logs, and the balance for their illegal detention under a claim of lien.\nThe question in the case arises upon the inclusion of the former sum. It is held by the Court of Appeal that the only consequence of a non-compliance with the provisions of sec. 3 of the Act is that the person injuriously affected may resort to the remedies given to him by the 4th and 5th sections and break the jam or obstruction at the ultimate expense of the neglecting or offending party.\nSection 3, already cited, imposes upon persons using streams for the purpose of floating logs a positive obligation (apart from any concurrence or mutual act of others using the water) to take reasonable steps to prevent an accumulation of his logs from unnecessarily delaying or hindering other persons in like use of the water. Unless an intention to the contrary appears it would prim\u00e2 facie follow that a legal right existed in one whose logs had been unnecessarily delayed or hindered to complain of breach of such obligation. It is said that the contrary intention appears in the provision of the next section (5), whereby \u201cin case of the neglect of any person to comply with the provisions of the preceding section\u201d it shall be lawful for such other person to break the jam himself, and charge the wrongdoer with the cost. But by section 17 (as we shall presently see) the like phraseology is employed to describe a ground of complaint giving a right to an arbitration under the Act:\nThe person claiming that another person had not complied with the provisions of this Act * * * shall give to such other person notice in writing stating the substance of the claims made and appointing an arbitrator, &c.\nSec. 16 declares that all claims, disputes, and differences arising under the Act shall be determined by arbitration, and not by action.\nA claim that a person has not complied with the provisions of the Act is a claim, dispute or difference arising under the Act within the meaning of sec. 16, because by sec. 17 this is explicitly and in terms made a ground for instituting arbitration proceedings.\nFour classes of claims are specified in sec. 17, as furnishing ground for instituting proceedings in arbitration. (1) That of a person claiming that another person has not complied with the provisions of the Act; (2) That of a person claiming payment of any charges or expenses under the Act; (3) That of a person claiming a lien upon any logs; (4) That of a person claiming damages under sec. 13.\nOf these, the second and third are in support and enforcement of the rights deprived from the exercise of the special remedial provisions of secs. 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11. The fourth is the relief of the person against whom the special remedial provisions have been used, and is directed against the abuse of an assumed authority under the Act, or its irregular exercise.\nThe second, third and fourth mentioned claims substantially cover all matters arising out of the exercise of the special powers, and the first mentioned claim, viz.: \u201cThat another person has not complied with the provisions of the Act\u201d is fairly to be held to refer to a non-compliance separate from the special remedial provisions. The most sensible and simplest construction is that they relate, at least, to non-compliance with the direct and positive obligation which is imposed, or declared, by section 3. The Court of Appeal was of opinion that from the fact that the right to recover damages is mentioned in sec. 13, and not mentioned in terms in sec. 3, it may reasonably be inferred that the intention of the Legislature was that the penalty for default should be solely the breaking of the jam at the cost of the person whose logs formed it.\nBut it does not seem reasonable thus to infer that what would obviously, under some circumstances likely to happen, be no adequate remedy, or no remedy at all, is to be assumed as intended by the Legislature to be the only remedy. The judgment appealed from gives no satisfactory meaning to the first clause of sec. 17.\nAs to the form of the notice, the substance being within the scope of the Act, it is sufficient if the parties have not been misled by any defect of form. This is not alleged, and that they have not been misled is manifest from what took place before the arbitrator where both parties were represented by counsel.

The contract of insurance entered into by the appellants is set forth in the body of the policy as follows:\nIn consideration of the written and printed application for this policy by Andrew Blackston Randall, of Grimsby, Province of Ontario, in the Dominion of Canada, and the answers and statements made by and on behalf of the applicant herein, which form a part of this contract, and the agreement on the part of the said applicant to accept the conditions and rules indorsed hereon and the conditions contained herein as a part of this contract between said association and himself, hereby constitutes the said applicant a benefit member of said association, and agrees in ninety days after there shall have been furnished to said association satisfactory proof of a valid claim under this contract, consequent upon the death of said member from any cause within the meaning of this contract, to pay out of the death fund of the association, and out of any money realised from premium calls to be made for that purpose, to Eleanor Marion Randall (wife) if living, otherwise to the executors or administrators of said member, the sum of two thousand dollars.\nA number of conditions were indorsed on the policy two of which must be specially referred to. The 13th condition was in these words.\nAn action to enforce the obligations of a policy may be validly taken in any court of competent jurisdiction in the province wherein the policy holder resides, or last resided before his decease, but no action, suit or claim shall be taken, brought or made upon any policy after the expiration of one year from the death of such member, without reference to the time of furnishing proofs of death, and such lapse of time shall be a conclusive bar to any recovery hereon, any statute to the contrary notwithstanding.\nThe 19th condition was as follows:\nDeath of the person insured from consumption, bronchitis, or any chronic pulmonary affection or from cancer, within one year from the date of the policy issued to the assured, or from the date of any revival of such policy, is a risk not contemplated or covered by the contract in such policy, and in such event the association shall have the right to cancel such policy and to return to the legal representative, or payee designated in such policy, the sum of all payments made thereon on account of Mortuary and Reserve Funds, which sum shall be accepted in full and complete settlement of all liability of said association under the contract contained in such policy.\nThe sum of $28.85 was duly paid by the assured to the appellants by way of premiums, or as it is called in the rules of the appellant association, on account of \u201cMortuary and Reserve Funds,\u201d being all that was due on that account according to the terms of the policy up to the date of the death of the assured.\nThe assured, Andrew Blackston Randall, died on the 16th of July, 1897.\nThe 14th condition indorsed on the policy embodies the requirements as to proofs of death and is thus expressed:\n14. (26) Before the payment of this policy, after the death of the member, proofs of death must be furnished, properly verified by statutory declaration on blanks furnished by the association for the purpose, and shall include: (1) A statement by the claimant or claimants. (2) A statement from each physician who attended deceased within three years before death. (3) A statement from a responsible householder who knew deceased. (4) A statement from the undertaker. (5) A statement from the clergyman where one officiates. (6) A copy of the verdict and of the evidence upon which it is based, duly certified wherever an inquest has been held. Also a certified copy, under seal of the proper court, of the letters of administration of the estate of the deceased, if he should die intestate, or of letters probate should he die leaving a will, or of letters of guardianship, or other instruments by virtue of or under which the claimant claims to be entitled, and such other reasonable proof as may be required by the association, and tender to the association of this policy at its head office with a proper release hereon indorsed of all claims hereunder, executed by the party entitled to receive the benefit thereof, or satisfactory proof of the loss or destruction of this policy, accompanied by a release duly executed by the person or persons entitled as aforesaid.\nOn the 7th of August, 1897, less than a month after the death of the assured, the respondent furnished and delivered to the appellants as proof of loss, five papers.\nThe first of these papers was a statutory declaration by the respondent herself made on the 4th of August, 1897, in which after describing herself as the widow of the assured and stating the death of her husband, she in the third paragaph thus states the cause of death: I was in constant attendance upon my said deceased husband, for several days before his death, and the said deceased did not die by his own hand but death was caused by phlebitis and tubercolosis caused by an attack of pneumonia as I am informed by his medical attendant and verily believe.\nThe second of these proofs was the statutory declaration of Dr. Milward, a physician and surgeon practising in the Village of Grimsby (where the assured lived and died) and who had been the medical attendant of the deceased in his last illness\u2014who declares as follows:\n(1) I was personally acquainted with the said Andrew Blackston Randall of the said Village of Grimsby, who was seen and attended in his last illness by me for the period of three and a half months preceding the sixteenth day of July, 1897, when he died at the said Village of Grimsby.\n(2) I saw the said deceased Andrew Blackston Randall after his death and he did not die by his own hands but that death was caused I have no doubt by tuberculosis caused by an attack of pneumonia, in January last, 1897, and death hastened by phlebitis the large veins of both lower limbs being badly affected.\nThere was also included in the proofs the declaration of Rev. John Muir, a minister of the Presbyterian Church of Canada, who assisted at the funeral of the deceased and who identified him as the person assured in the policy.\nJames C. Martell, the undertaker, who conducted the funeral of the deceased also makes a declaration in which he states the death and funeral, and that he had read the declarations of Mrs. Randall and Dr. Millward and believes them to \u201ccontain a true statement of the facts.\u201d\nSamuel E. Mabey, a householder in the Village of Grimsby, states in his declaration that he had known deceased for thirty years, and that he had read the declaration of Dr. Millward and believed the said declaration to contain a true statement of the facts and of the cause of the death of the assured, and that he had also read the declaration of the respondent which he believed also to contain a true statement of facts.\nNo proofs of loss other than those stated were ever presented to the appellants by the respondent or by any one on her behalf.\nThe appellants refusing to pay the amount of the insurance money and disputing their liability to do so, the respondent on the 11th of December, 1897, brought her action on the policy to recover the amount insured. In the statement of claim the respondent states the terms of the policy to have been to pay \u201cin ninety days after there should have been furnished to the defendants proof of a claim under the contract contained in such policy consequent upon the death of the said Andrew Blackston Randall.\u201d The statement of claim then proceeds to allege the death of the assured, at the date already mentioned, and then the fourth paragraph alleges compliance with all conditions as well that relating to proofs of loss as others in the following terms:\nThe plaintiff duly furnished the defendants proof of the death of her said husband and of a claim under the said contract and policy on the 7th day of August, 1897, and all conditions were performed, all things happened and all times elapsed necessary to entitle the plaintiff to a performance by the defendants of their said agreement and to be paid the said sum of $2,000, yet the defendants have not paid the same or any part thereof.\nBy the statement of defence the appellants in the second paragraph put the respondent to proof of the allegations of the statement of claim. This second paragraph is as follows:\nThe defendants admit the allegations contained in paragraph 1 of the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, but deny the allegations contained in the other paragraphs thereof and put the plaintiff to the strict proof thereof.\nThe defence further set up amongst other defences that the assured had died of consumption, and that therefore under the 19th condition no cause of action arose.\nIssue was joined by the respondent on this defence.\nA few days after the respondent\u2019s action was commenced the appellants instituted a cross action to have the policy delivered up to be cancelled, and had delivered their statement of claim when an order was made by the Master in Chambers consolidating the two actions.\nThe trial took place before the Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division at St. Catharines, on the 30th of May, 1898, without a jury, when judgment was pronounced for the respondent for the amount sued for, without costs.\nFrom this judgment there was an appeal to the Court of Appeal, by which court the judgment was affirmed, the learned judges all concurring in the decision.\nThe learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, who presided at the trial, seems to have considered that the burden of proof in respect of all the issues raised by the pleadings was on the appellants. This view appears also to have been taken by some of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal. The Chief Justice of Ontario, however, expressed a clear opinion that there was an issue raising the question as to the sufficiency of the proofs of loss but that the appellants have waived their defence under it. The learned Chief Justice in his judgment thus expresses himself:\nIt was not in my opinion a matter of defence that satisfactory proofs of a valid claim were not presented, but it was something to be proved by the plaintiff before any liability attached; but if the company were willing to waive that requirement, it was open, and I think creditable to them to do so, for it is a very harsh condition to insert in a policy of insurance intended as a provision for the family of the party assuring. If I could see that the defence referred to had been in fact waived I might agree to this, but as I shall more fully state hereafter I fail to see any waiver which would support the view of the Chief Justice.\nMr. Justice Maclennan\u2019s judgment proceeded upon the omission of the appellants to set up in their statement of defence any objection to the non-delivery of sufficient proofs of loss. In this I entirely differ from him. Mr. Justice Maclennan however did not think there was any waiver at the trial, for he distinctly says the contrary;\nIn this case the point was raised for the first time on the argument before the learned Chief Justice at the conclusion of the evidence, and I think he very properly gave no effect to it.\nMr. Justice Osler treats the case as though the only question raised at the trial was that upon the evidence as to the actual cause of death.\nUpon the record before the learned trial judge it was clearly an issue whether ninety days before the commencement of the action the respondent had furnished to the appellants \u201csatisfactory proof of a valid claim under the contract.\u201d\nThe course of pleading has now very much departed from the old forms of common law pleadings; substantially however the rules remain the same. Probata secundum allegata is just as much the rule as it ever was. There can be no doubt upon the plain words of the policy that delivery of proofs of a valid cause of death was an essential condition precedent which it was incumbent on the plaintiff in the action to establish both in pleading and in proof, and it was incumbent on her to shew that she had ninety days before action furnished the required proof. This requirement as to pleading was sufficiently complied with by the allegation contained in the 4th section of her pleading that she had duly furnished to the defendants proof of the death of her husband and of a claim under the contract and policy and by the further general allegation that all conditions were performed, all things happened and all times elapsed necessary to entitle the plaintiff to be paid the sum assured.\nIndeed without any reference at all to the furnishing of proofs of loss, the general mode of pleading would have been sufficient, and if it had been adopted the respondent would nevertheless have had to make out her case by proof of the performance of the conditions. Under the old rule of pleading which prevailed before the Common Law Procedure Act, specific allegations of performance of conditions precedent were required. This was altered by that Act which permitted a general allegation of performance to be substituted for the former more precise mode of pleading. And this, as I understand, must still remain the law for under the Ontario Judicature Act there has been no alteration in the rules of pleading as there has been in England where it is not now required to allege even in general terms any performance of conditions precedent, such an allegation being implied. English Order 19 Rule 14; Odgers on Pleading (3 ed.) p. 81; Bullen & Leake (5 ed.) p. 188. The rule however remains as it always was, that performance of conditions precedent to the defendants\u2019 liability must be proved by the plaintiff.\nThere is not now nor was there ever any rule requiring the defendant to set up a non-performance of conditions precedent.\nIt is plain, therefore, that at the trial supposing there to have been no consent or waiver or \u201cputting aside\u201d of a most substantial defence on the part of the appellants they were entitled to insist (as they did in fact insist) that the respondent should prove that ninety days before action brought she had delivered proofs of a valid claim under the policy. The appellants by their pleading in defence sufficiently put this question in issue by the second paragraph denying the allegations of the respondent and putting her to \u201cstrict proof thereof.\u201d Even if there had not been this denial but the appellant had allowed the averment to pass sub silentio the respondent would still have been obliged to establish that she duly furnished proofs of loss for the rules under the Ontario Judicature Act, in this respect again differing from the English Act (Order 19, Rule 13; Odgers on Pleading, (3 ed.) p. 131,) provide that all allegations not specifically admitted shall be taken as denied. (Con. Rule 272.)\nThen, how did the respondent perform this obligation which was thus cast upon her? She proved that she had furnished proofs of loss showing the death of the assured but proofs which upon their face necessarily defeated her action inasmuch as they showed that the deceased had died within nine months from the date of the policy from consumption, a case in which the 19th condition expressly provides the appellants shall not be liable, the words of that condition being that \u201cdeath from consumption within one year from the date of the policy * * is a risk not contemplated or covered by the contract in such policy.\u201d\nThe question of waiver is next to be considered. The improbability of any such concession to the respondent in an action so stoutly contested as this has been is very considerable when we recall a few dates which shew that this was not a mere dilatory defence which could have been avoided by dismissing the action, paying costs and delivering new proofs of loss. The assured died on the 16th of July, 1897, the trial took place on the 30th of May, 1898; had the action then been dismissed and new proof immediately furnished, no cause of action would have arisen until the 28th of August, 1898. Then an action brought at that date would have been too late for it would have been barred by the 13th condition which expressly provides\nthat no action, suit or claim shall be taken, brought or made upon any policy after the expiration of one year from the death of such member without reference to the time of furnishing proofs of death, and such lapse of time shall be conclusive to bar any recovery hereon.\nIt thus appears that the defence alleged to have been waived was one going to the root of the action, one which must have been conclusive if any conditions stipulated for by assurance companies can be binding on those who contract with them.\nThen if there was any effective waiver it must, in the face of the positive denials of the counsel for the appellants who at this bar most strenuously disclaimed ever having had any intention of abandoning the defence, be shewn from something appearing on the face of the printed record before us. It was manifestly not conceded by counsel for the appellants in the Court of Appeal that there had been any waiver or we should not find two of the learned judges there dealing with the point, whilst one of them (Mr. Justice Maclennan) expressly says the point was raised at the trial for the first time at the conclusion of the evidence. In order to ascertain the true state of facts as to the waiver we have most carefully scrutinised the report contained in the printed case of what took place at the trial, but we find nothing indicating that counsel for the appellants agreed to anything or said anything which could be considered as an abandonment of the defence in question.\nAt the conclusion of the evidence the learned Chief Justice addressing counsel said: \u201cWhat do you say as to the defence you have made out, Mr. Osler?\u201d The learned counsel answers: \u201cWe say, my lord, that under the terms of the policy it is not a covenant to pay at death but a covenant upon proof of a valid claim under this contract consequent upon death within the meaning of this contract.\u201d\nThis I construe as counsel before us contended it should be construed as expressly insisting upon the defence.\nThen again the counsel repeats: \u201cI say our contract is not at large, death and then a condition, but our contract is a payment under the circumstances covered by the contract.\u201d Further Mr. Osler is reported as again urging the same defence in these words; \u201cWe submit that everything shews that the suggested kick\u2014no such thing is proved\u2014is a mere afterthought, a mere method by which they seek to avoid the condition of the policy upon which we rest, made out in fact by their own proofs. They are bound to give us the proofs and bound to give us the true proofs; they cannot be heard to say \u2018These are not the true proofs,\u2019 so we submit our case under the policy and under the contract is made out.\u201d\nOn the whole it does not appear that there was any waiver but so far from it that the defence was insisted upon by counsel but overruled by the learned Chief Justice though for what reason does not distinctly appear. This seems to have been the view of Mr. Justice Maclennan and we think it entirely right.\nHad we been of a different opinion as regards the point already considered it is not probable that we could have affirmed the judgment under appeal. It is true that the question as to the cause of death is entirely one of fact and that there was contradictory expert evidence but having regard to the deliberate statement in the declaration of the medical attendant, the absence of any attempt to explain and correct this until the trial, and other surrounding circumstances, we are all of opinion that it would have been very difficult to come to any other conclusion than one at variance with the finding of the learned Chief Justice. And we should not have been precluded from entering upon an examination of the evidence upon this head by the rule that a second court of appeal will not interfere with the concurrent finding of two preceding courts on a question of fact, a rule well established and often acted upon here as well as in the Privy Council, and also in some late cases in the Supreme Court of the United States[1].\nIn order to apply the rule referred to it must appear however that the question of evidence has undergone consideration in both the court of first instance and the first court of appeal. That does not appear to have been the case since the learned judges of the Court of Appeal did not deal with the question of evidence but decided on other grounds. We are therefore in the position as regards this question of a first court of appeal and as the court was in the case of Jones v. Hough[2] which authority establishes generally the right of an appellant if the question is open to have the evidence taken on a trial without a jury reviewed on appeal.\nIf it all depended on the credit to be given to witnesses I should be of the same opinion as Mr. Justice Osler, but it is not a case altogether dependent on such consideration, but rather on the inferences to be drawn from surrounding facts not disputed and from documents, in other words a question of circum- stantial evidence complicated with the opinions of experts. Although all my learned brothers agree on this view, we decide the appeal upon the first point. The judgment must be reversed and the action dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed wilh costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hoskin, Ogden & Hoskin.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.A.

The Crown appealed on the ground that the damages were excessive.\nHeld, Gwynne and Girouard JJ. dissenting, that as it did not appear from the evidence that there was error in the judgment appealed from, the Supreme Court would not interfere with the decision of the Exchequer Court Judge.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada adjudging that the lands mentioned in the information were vested in Her Majesty The Queen, for the purposes of the Trent Valley Canal, and awarding $14,158 to the respondent, the Honourable John Douglas Armour, as compensation for the said lands with interest and costs, and $100 to the respondent Henry Cox, for damages in respect of his lease of said lands with costs. The questions at issue upon this appeal sufficiently appear from the judgments reported.\nThe judgment appealed from was delivered on the 12th of September, 1898, the learned judge of the Exchequer Court stating his reasons for judgment as follows:\nBURBIDGE J.\u2014The information is filed to obtain a declaration that certain lands situated in the County of Peterborough, taken for the Trent Canal, are vested in Her Majesty, and that a sum of six thousand eight hundred and sixty dollars tendered to the defendent, the Honourable John Douglas Armour is sufficient compensation for the lands so taken, and for damages to adjoining lands held therewith.\nThe question of compensation is the only matter in dispute. The amount tendered is made up of a sum of three thousand eight hundred and sixty dollars for the land taken and a sum of three thousand dollars for damages. The valuators, on whose report the tender was made, put the value of the land taken at two hundred dollars per acre, and I have no difficulty, in view of the evidence as a whole, in accepting that as a fair value.\nThere is, however, a slight discrepancy between the statements of the quantity of land taken, as given in the tender, on the one hand, and in the pleadings and proof in this case, on the other. In the former it is stated at nineteen acres and three-tenths of an acre; in the latter at nineteen acres and fifty-four-hundredths of an acre. I accept the latter as being correct, and allow three thousand nine hundred and eight dollars for the value of the lands so taken.\nWith reference to the damages, the evidence discloses a wide difference of opinion. That the amount tendered for damages was not sufficient, can, I think, admit of little doubt, but what that amount should be is a question not without its difficulties. I am of opinion, however, to allow in respect thereof, the sum of ten thousand two hundred and fifty dollars. That sum is less than the amount at which Mr. A. F. Wood and other witnesses, who in a general way agreed with him, estimated such damages, but it appears to me to be sufficiently liberal to cover and include all possible elements of damage presented by the case, excepting a sum of one hundred dollars, which, it was understood at the trial, the Crown was to pay to the tenant, Cox, for injury to his crops; the other damages sustained by the tenant being, it was agreed, settled for by the landlord, and included in the general damages awarded to him.\nThere will be a declaration that the lands mentioned in the information are vested in Her Majesty, and that the defendant, the Honourable John Douglas Armour, is, upon giving the Crown proper discharges or releases from the other defendants, entitled to be paid for compensation for the lands taken, and for damages, the sum of fourteen thousand one hundred and fifty-eight dollars with interest at six per centum per annum, from the eighth day of May, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-six, and that the defendant Henry Cox, is entitled to be paid the sum of one hundred dollars.\nThe defendants will also have their costs.\nS. H. Blake, K.C. and Edwards for the appellant. Osler,\nK.C. and Aylesworth, K.C for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The information was filed in the Exchequer Court to obtain a declaration that certain lands situate in the County of Peterboro, taken for the Trent Valley Canal, were vested in the Crown, and that the amount tendered therefor and for the injurious affection of adjoining lands, viz., six thousand eight hundred and sixty dollars, should be deemed sufficient compensation.\nThe case was tried before Mr. Justice Burbidge who awarded for the lands taken the sum of three thousand nine hundred and eight dollars, and for damages done to the adjoining lands the sum of ten thousand two hundred and fifty dollars. From that judgment the Crown has appealed to this court.\nAt the argument of the appeal I was strongly impressed with the view that these damages were excessive and I subsequently endeavoured to write a judgment giving effect to that view, but in this attempt I failed. After a repeated perusal of the evidence I found it impossible, if proper effect was to be given to it, to do otherwise than confirm the judgment. It seemed to me that it would be necessary to demonstrate in the clearest possible way by reference to the evidence in the case that there was error in the judgment. This was impossible. The learned trial judge who heard the evidence came to a conclusion upon it and the respondent is entitled to the benefit of that conclusion unless the Crown can present a clear case to show he was wrong.\nIn my view the appeal should be dismissed with costs. There should be amalgamated with the present judgment, if the Crown so desire, the undertaking of the Crown with respect to the subway referred to in the evidence.\nGWYNNE J. (dissenting.)\u2014I am compelled to dissent with great deference from the judgment in this case.\nThe question is as to the amount to be paid by the Dominion Government for nineteen and a half acres expropriated for the Trent Valley Canal out of a farm of two hundred and twenty acres of which the respondent Armour is seized in fee subject to a mortgage and to a lease for a term of years not yet expired, to one Cox, tenant of the whole farm. A portion of the farm is within the limits of the Village of Ashburnham and it is claimed by the respondent Armour that such part has a special value as village property and that the construction of the canal will depreciate the value as village lots of so much of the land within the limits of the village plot as is not expropriated.\nBut during the past thirty years there has been no demand for such land as village lots; all has been occupied and cultivated as farm land and there is not in the evidence any ground for entertaining any reasonable expectation that there shall be any greater demand for such land as village lots in the next thirty years than in the past. Every estimate both of the value of such land as village lots, and of the alleged depreciation in their value of the part not expropriated occasioned by the construction of the canal is purely speculative, conjectural, fanciful and illusory in the extreme. In fine, without entering into a detailed analysis of the evidence it is sufficient for me to say I am of opinion that the only conclusion warranted by a full, fair and reasonable appreciation of the evidence is that the sum tendered by the Government, namely six thousand eight hundred and sixty dollars ($6,860), which is over twenty per cent of the utmost value of the whole farm of two hundred and twenty acres, and all the buildings thereon, none of which are on the part expropriated as existing without the canal, is liberal and ample compensation for the nineteen and a half acres expropriated and for all damage by depreciation, severance or otherwise of the land not expropriated, consequent upon and attributable to the construction of the canal, and for which the Court of Exchequer has allowed fourteen thousand one hundred and fifty-eight dollars ($14,158), besides interest thereon, or upwards of forty per cent of the utmost value of the whole two hundred and twenty acres.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the appeal should be allowed.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting).\u2014In expropriation cases and generally in all matters where the valuation of land is involved, I have always been inclined to maintain the findings of experts acting officially, unless clearly wrong. As usual, the evidence in this instance is contradictory. Seven or eight practising attorneys at law, and a few others, have given testimony in favour of the respondent, but, in my humble opinion, it is not of sufficient weight to destroy the report of the experts, supported as it is by the witnesses of the appellant.\nAll the parties expropriated along the canal have declared themselves well satisfied with the valuation made, except the respondent; but, I see no reason why he should feel to have been unfairly treated.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the amount fixed by the valuators should be restored and the appeal allowed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor or the appellant: E. L. Newcombe.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Barwick, Ayelsworth & Wright.\n"}
