J. and Gwynne, Sedgewick, King and Girouard JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nNew trial\u2014Verdict\u2014Finding of jury\u2014Question of fact\u2014Misapprehension.\nWhere a case has been properly submitted to the jury and their findings upon the facts are such as might be the conclusions of reasonable men, a new trial will not be granted on the ground that the jury misapprehended or misunderstood the evidence, notwithstanding that the trial judge was dissatisfied with the verdict.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, en banc, which refused a motion for a new trial with costs.\nThe material circumstances of the case are sufficiently shewn by the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Henry in the court below, which are as follows:\n\"This is a motion for a new trial. The plaintiff is assignee of the goods and estate of I. N. Mack and I. N. Mack & Co., under an assignment for the benefit of creditors made by I. N. Mack, who carried on business under the above firm name. The defendant is the sheriff of Queen's County, who under an execution against the assignor seized certain of the goods and chattels covered by the assignment. The defence was that the deed was fraudulent, as having been made to hinder and delay the creditors. The jury found a verdict for defendant, and an order for judgment in accordance with the verdict was granted by the learned trial judge. Notice of appeal from this order was given, but nothing was brought forward in support of the appeal at the argument of the motion for a new trial. We have a very full report of the charge of the learned trial judge to the jury, and it appears that he submitted to them a number of unquestionably material and important considerations based upon the evidence, for the purpose of aiding them in the determination of the question whether the deed was or was not fraudulent. It was not pretended at the argument that the case should have been withdrawn from the jury, and I am of the opinion that it is one which, having regard to the evidence as a whole, a detailed discussion of which would now serve no useful purpose, must be treated as absolutely in the control of the jury. In saying this I do not forget that the learned judge has reported that a verdict for the plaintiff would have commended itself more to his judgment.\"\n\"It appears by the learned judge's report that the jury had some difficulty in applying the view they took as to the question of fraud to the project of announcing their conclusion in the shape of a verdict for the plaintiff or the defendant. The foreman at first said that they found for plaintiff, whereupon he was interrupted by the juryman standing next to him who immediately went on to confer in an undertone with other members of the jury. The learned judge then said: 'Mr. Foreman, you say you find for the plaintiff, which means that you find in favour of the deed.' The foreman replied, 'Oh, no, we find there was fraud.' The learned judge reports that he then again addressed them, explaining the relation of the parties. It appears that some of the jury on their way back to the jury room spoke to the sheriff. The learned judge told the sheriff he must not converse with them and asked him what they said. He replied in their hearing that they desired to know of him who was the defendant. The learned judge gave them no further instructions, but in a very few minutes they returned and said they found a verdict for the defendant.\"\n\"It is not necessary to determine accurately the extent of the intelligence of this jury. It seems sufficient to say that, notwithstanding the difficulty which some of them, possibly only the foreman and one or two others, had in seeing the relation of the parties, plaintiff and defendant, in the cause to the only question upon which they had to pass, they do not seem to have had any difficulty in finding upon that question. Their verdict being in accordance with that finding it cannot be disturbed upon any reason based upon the circumstances under which it was rendered. I am of the opinion that the motion for a new trial should be refused with costs.\"\nThe trial court judge in his report, after referring to the conduct of the jury, said: \"I concluded that all my efforts, as well as those of the counsel, to get them to understand the case intelligently, had been wasted, and that it was useless to say anything further to them. They returned in a very few minutes into court, and said they found for the defendant. A verdict for the plaintiff would have commended itself much more to my judgment.\"\nDrysdale Q.C. for the appellant. There was no evidence upon which the jury could find fraud, and even assuming that they understood the question submitted to them, it is not such a verdict as reasonable men could find. There was a mistrial, and the jury never understood the issue upon which they were to render a verdict. The trial judge disapproved of the verdict and, under the latest authorities, this is a material factor in determining whether a new trial ought to be granted or refused. See Aitkin v. McMeckan[1], at page 316.\nHarris Q.C. for the respondent. The jury entertained clear views as to the fraudulent character of the deed. That was the chief point, and their conclusions were reasonable and fully justified by the evidence. We rely upon Municipality of Brisbane v. Martin[2]; Phillips v. Martin[3]; Metropolitan Railway Co. v. Wright[4]; Solomon v. Bitton[5]; Australian Newspaper Co. v. Bennett[6]. While fraud cannot be presumed without evidence, yet there are circumstances in this case from which the jury might infer it; Riches v. Evans[7]; Winchester v. Charter[8].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014(Oral.) We are all of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed with costs. If some English decisions favour the appellant's case, the weight of Canadian and American decisions are the other way. We decide this appeal on the principle that the question of fact was left to and dealt with by the jury in such a manner that we cannot interfere with their findings. For precisely the same reasons as those given by Mr. Justice Henry, namely, that the finding of fraud by the jury was not an unreasonable finding upon the evidence, we think the verdict cannot be interfered with.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014(Oral.) I agree with the remarks of the learned Chief Justice. On the crucial point in issue the jury found fraud, and. I agree with their finding. SEDGEWICK, KING and GIROUARD JJ. concurred with His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Jason M. Mack.\nSolicitor for the respondent: David A.

But the easement must have been enjoyed by the former owner at the time of the sale. Therefore, one purchaser could not claim the right to use a dam on his land in such a way as to cause the water to flow back on the other property, where such right, if it had ever been enjoyed by the former owner, had been abandoned years before the sale.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, en banc[1], reversing the judgment of Townshend J. at the trial in favour of the plaintiff and dismissing the counter-claim filed by the judgment.\nA statement of the facts and of the questions at issue in the case appears in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Sedgewick, now reported. Borden Q.C. and Harris Q.C. for the appellant. The appellant relies on the reasons stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Townshend[2].\nThe easement was apparent and continuous. The alteration in the premises during unity of ownership was permanent in its character, consisting of the dam strongly constructed of permanent material and having annexed thereto and connected therewith permanent abutments and a waste-way, cut through the solid rock at great expense, which would be utterly useless unless the dam was to be used with the slanting top as now in use by the plaintiff. We refer to Watts v. Kelson[3]; Atrill v, Platt[4]; Polden v. Bastard[5]; Hall v. Lund[6]; Worthington v. Gimson[7]; Nicholas v. Chamberlain[8]; Brown v. Alabaster[9]; Thomas v Owen[10]; Culverwell v. Lockington[11]; Pearson v. Spencer[12]; Wheeldon v. Burrows[13]; Gale on Easements (7 ed.), pp. 21 and 96-121; Goddard on Easements (5 ed.), pp. 174-186; Leake on the Use and Profits of Land, p. 269; Jones on Easements, secs 139, 143, 145-150; Kerr on Injunctions (3 ed.) star page 197, and Ewart v. Cochrane[14], the leading case upon this branch of the law.\nAs to the result when the common owner conveys to different owners by simultaneous conveyances see Elphinstone on Deeds, rule 58, p. 202; Goddard on Easements (5 ed.), pp. 270 to 273, and Gale on Easements, pp. 100 to 104. Sec also Compton v. Richards[15]; Swansborough v. Coventry[16]; Allen v. Taylor[17]; Barnes v. Loach[18]; Rigby v. Bennet[19], at page 567;. Russell v Walts[20]; and Phillips v. Lowe[21].\nThe facts indicating intention to create a quasi-easement upon the property are (a) the construction of mills; (b) that the only power for operating those mills was created by this dam; (c) the construction of this dam of solid and permanent material; (d) the waste-way and (e) flumes, of no use except with the dam at its present height; (f) the construction and facing of abutments to a height only useful or necessary with the slanting-top.\nAlthough a portion of the slanting-top was carried away and not replaced from 1876 until 1895 the dam itself remained permanent and apparent, and the jury found thai the use and purpose of the slanting-top were also apparent in 1892. The non-existence of a portion of the slanting-top during this period is of no more importance than a hole in the dam or a break in the slanting-top. The apparent easement was the right to maintain the dam at the height indicated by its appearance and construction in 1892, when the old frames of the slanting-top still remained in position, and the flat logs and the mortices therein for the frames of the slanting-top were still visible. The right to light would not be lost because window panes were destroyed by accident. The existence of the window opening and of the dam indicates the extent of the easement. Calhoun v. Rourke[22]; Courtauld v. Legh[23]; Collis v. Laugher[24].\nThere was no abandonment of nor intention to abandon the use of the dam and the position of the flumes and waste-way, which never altered, made it necessary to use the slanting-top. The structure of the dam on both sides was of a height which indicated that the slanting-top must be used. The rebuilding of the mills in 1876 indicated an intention not to abandon, but to use the dam and operate the mills. But even if the owner had ceased operation because his capital could be more profitably employed, that would not be sufficient evidence of abandonment. By reason merely of non-user, an intention cannot be presumed to take from the quasi dominant tenement the qualities previously attached thereto by the common owner. Such intention should not be presumed from evidence less than would be necessary to establish abandonment of an easement on properties in possession of different owners. See Hale v. Oldroyd[25]; Stokoe v. Singers[26]; Ecclesiastical Commissioners v. Kino[27]; Seaman v. Vawdrey[28]; Bower v. Hill[29]; James v. Stevenson[30]; Ward v. Ward[31]; Crossley & Sons v. Lightowler[32]; Reg v. Chorley[33].\nIt was an easement of necessity incident to the act of the owner of the dominant and servient tenements and without which the intention of the parties to the severance could not be carried into effect. Morris v. Edgington[34]; Dand v. Kingscote[35]; Ewart v. Cochrane[36]; Brown v. Alabaster[37].\nThe conveyance expressly grants the quasi-easement in question. The words are:\u2014\"All dams, buildings, ways, waters, watercourses, easements, privileges, and appurtenances to the said lots of land belonging or in any wise appertaining, etc. To have and to hold the said lands and premises, appurtenances and hereditaments, together with all and singular the easements hereby conveyed.\" The words \"easements\" and \"dams\" are sufficient to pass this quasi-easement or privilege or quality annexed to the property. See notes on Pinnington v. Galland and Hall v. Lund[38]; Washburn on Easements, p. 58; Rackley v. Sprague[39], and cases there cited; Hathorn v. Stinson[40]; Baker v. Bessey[41]; Richardson v. Bigtlow[42]; Lammott v. Ewers[43]; Oakley v. Stanley[44]; Bayley v. Great Western Railway Co.[45]; Broomfield v. Williams[46]. The conveyance of the dam would be useless unless it included the right to use it effectively, and there could be no such user unless it were raised to its full apparent height as it existed in November, 1892.\nThe stringer on top of the dam had the effect of raising the water one foot above the block-dam both at the time of the plaintiff's purchase and up to the present time, and penned back the water from 1876 to the present time. The court below should not have granted an injunction in terms restraining the defendant from penning back water by the block-dam and stringer as the only question tried was with respect to the right to pen back water by the slanting top. No question was raised at the trial as to the right to use the block-dam with its stringer to the fullest extent, and, as to this, there is not any pretence of abandonment. We refer also to Birmingham, Dudley & District Banking Co. v. Ross[47], at pages 312, 314 and 315, and the cases collected in Dunklee v. Wilton Railroad Co.[48] at pages 500-501, and to Pickering v. Stapler[49]; Voorhees v. Burchard[50]; and New-Ispwich Factory v. Batchelder[51].\nDrysdale Q.C. and Layton for the respondent. We refer to the reasons for judgment by the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Ritchie in the court below[52] shewing that there has been a failure to establish a quasi-easement of the requisite open, apparent and continuous nature, and there can be no implied grant of an easement. Neither at the time of the severances nor for upwards of seventeen years prior thereto had there been any structure upon appellant's lands capable of backing water upon respondent's lands. The doctrine of implied grant as applied to quasi-easements refers to easements in use at the time of the severance. The owner, before the severance, had not made or used any improvement in one part for the benefit of another nor used appellant's lands so as to back water upon those now held by respondent. There is no evidence that such a right is reasonably necessary to the beneficial enjoyment of the property, nor of severance of common property, but only a distinct sale of independent lands.

The words quoted in appellant's deed convey only legal easements. Beddington v. Atlee[60]; Polden v. Bastard[61]; Birmingham Dudley & Dist. Banking Co. v. Ross[62]; Elphinstone on Deeds, rr. 54, 55, 59. Specific quasi-easements and privileges are mentioned so no construction can be had leaving anything implied; expressio unius exclusio alterius.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The plaintiff is the owner of a mill on the St. Croix River, in Hants County, Nova Scotia. The defendant owns a mill further up the stream, which is mainly supplied with water power from a storage-dam still further up stream. This dam broke, and the waters rushing down stream broke away the plaintiff\u2019s dam, and it was for the damage thus occasioned that this action was brought. In the action, however, the defendant counterclaimed, alleging that he was damaged by reason of the plaintiff's dam penning back water upon his land and obstructing the operations of his mill. The main action has been settled, and the only question before this court is as to whether the defendant is entitled to succeed upon the counterclaim.\nThe properties, both of the plaintiff and the defendant, were, in the year 1873, owned by one Francis Ellershausen, who conveyed to the Nova Scotia Land & Manufacturing Co., Limited. While Mr. Ellershausen owned the property, he operated a paper mill, and for the purpose of creating water-power, he built a portion of the dam which is in question, a structure, as originally built, of about one hundred and eighty feet in length on the top, and thirty-eight feet in height from the bed of the river. The main portion of the darn, called the block-dam, was a strong structure built of logs from the bed of the river, and that part of the dam remains to the present day. Upon the block-dam, however, Ellershausen constructed a small structure about eight feet in height, called a false-top, or slanting-top. The mill for the purposes of which this dam was constructed, was operated from the summer of 1873, to December, 1875, and from then was never operated until some time after the plaintiff purchased in 1892.\nThat portion of the dam called the false-top was swept away, and during the whole of the seventeen years following the original dam remained practically as if there had never been any structure on top of it, and not until 1895 was it rebuilt. During the time that Mr. Ellershausen operated this mill he also operated the mill up stream now owned by the defendant. In 1895 the plaintiff erected a new false-top upon the old structure, this false-top being no greater in height and no different in any way from the original structure. The result of this, however, was to flood back the water so that the wheel of the plaintiff\u2019s mill above was prevented from doing its proper work.\nIn 1892, all of these properties, then being still owned by the same parties, were put up for sale at public auction, the plaintiff buying his mill and the defendant buying his, thus severing the pre-existing unity of ownership. At this time, the block-dam existed and there were indications showing that some time before there had been a false-top built upon it.\nThe plaintiff's claim is that inasmuch as the owner of this property many years before had erected this dam with the false-top, and had used it for a few years, and he having purchased it, knowing the uses to which the previous owner had put it, had a right, notwithstanding that the false-top had been swept away and had not been operated or used for seventeen years, to replace it by a structure of the same character, creating no greater burden upon the upper property than the original dam had done, and the whole question turns upon that contention.\nWe are all of opinion that, under the circumstances of this case, the plaintiff's claim cannot be entertained. It is not disputed that if at the time of the plaintiff's purchase, a dam of the character originally there, or of the character now there had been in existence, the plaintiff upon acquiring title, would acquire a title also to an easement upon the upper land, inasmuch as it is clearly settled that where two properties belonging to the same owner are sold at the same time, and each purchaser has notice of the sale to the other, the right to any continuous and apparent quasi-easement passes with the sale. What was only a quasi-easement or user before, becomes after severance, an absolute legal right.\nBut the question here is: Must not the user of the original owner, which it is claimed becomes converted into a right by the purchaser, substantially exist at the time of the severance of the title? Can the purchaser after he has purchased, subject his neighbour, or can he, years after a particular user has ceased, after such a dam as is in question here has been destroyed, claim the right to re-erect the dam and impose upon a neighbour a servitude of which, when he purchased he had no notice except what might be afforded by a few planks and other decaying remains of what had once been there?\nI think the authorities shew that the quasi-easement must exist and be enjoyed at the time of the severance and that it is not sufficient if that use had ceased many years before. In the case of Suffield v. Brown[63], Lord Westbury's observations are to the effect that on a grant by an owner of an entire heritage, of part of that heritage as it is then used and enjoyed, there will pass to the grantee all those continuous and apparent easements which have been and are at the time of the grant used by the owner of the entirely for the benefit of the parcel granted. In the well known case of Wheeldon v. Burrows[64], Thesiger L. J. says that on the grant by the owner of a tenement, of part of that tenement as it is then used and enjoyed there wall pass to the grantee all those apparent and continuous easements, or, in other words, all those easements which are necessary to the reasonable enjoyment of the property granted, and which have been and are at the time of the grant used by the owner of the entirety for the benefit of the part granted.\nIn this case, at the time of the grant, or at the time of the severance, there was in fact no existing user, or no means of using the property to the detriment of the alleged servient tenement. There was only some indication that many years previously there had been such a user.\nI am of opinion, under the circumstances, that no easement such as is now claimed passed, and that the subsequent construction of the dam complained of, in so far as it in any way affected the operation of the defendant's mill up-stream, has no legal sanction.\nThis is not a case where there has been an accidental or temporary stoppage of an easement, as where a drain is blocked, or a way impeded, or a light obstructed. Accidental and temporary circumstances of this kind may not destroy the right to the easement, but where a way is absolutely destroyed, or a window boarded up for many years, we think, in that case, the fright is gone.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs, but there should be a variation of the decree restraining the plaintiff only from penning back the water otherwise than by the dam as existing at the time he purchased his mill.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: William A.

In an action against the Tramway Company for damages it appeared that the accident occurred on part of a down grade several hundred feet long, and that the motorman after seeing the cab tried to stop the car with the brakes, and that proving ineffectual reversed the power, being then about a car length from the cab. The jury found that the car was running at too high a rate of speed, and that there was also negligence in the failure to reverse the current in time to avert the accident; that the driver was negligent in not looking more sharply for the car; and that notwithstanding such negligence on the part of the driver the accident could have been averted by the exercise of reasonable care.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (32 N. S. Rep. 117) Gwynne J. dissenting, that the last finding neutralized the effect of that of contributory negligence; that as the car was on a down grade and going at an excessive rate of speed it was incumbent on the servants of the company to exercise a very high degree of skill and care in order to control it if danger was threatened to any one on the highway; and that from the evidence given it was impossible to say that everything was done that reasonably should have been done to prevent damage from the excessive speed at which the car was being run.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] sustaining the verdict for the plaintiff at the trial. The facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nHarrington Q.C. and Covert for the appellant.\nBorden Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nKING J.\u2014This is an appeal by the defendants in an action brought by a cab owner to recover damages caused by the alleged negligent running of the defendants' electric cars. The accident took place on the evening of the 20th November, 1897, while the plaintiffs vehicle was in the act of crossing the track on one of the public streets of Halifax. The jury, amongst other findings, found that there was negligence on the part of the Tramway Company in the running of their car at too high a rate of speed, and in the failure to apply the brakes and reverse the electric current in time to avert the accident, and in the opinion of the jury this could have been done had reasonable care been exercised by the motorman. They also found that there was negligence on the part of the plaintiff's driver contributing to the accident in not looking more sharply for the car. But they further found that notwithstanding such negligence of the plaintiff's driver, the defendants' servant could have averted the accident by the exercise of reasonable care. The trial took place before Mr. Justice Henry who, upon these findings, entered judgment for the plaintiff, and the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirmed the judgment.\nNo real question can arise as to there being evidence to warrant the finding that the rate of speed was excessive and unreasonable, nor (in view of the facts adduced on both sides) is there any doubt that if there was fault oil the part of defendants in the running of the car it was the cause of the accident, subject of course, to the effect of the finding as to contributory negligence.\nAs to the finding of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff's driver in not looking more sharply for the car before attempting to cross the track; supposing (as contended by Mr. Harrington) that according to the practice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia the respondent is prevented from urging the manifestly unsatisfactory character of this finding by reason of not having specially moved in that court to set it aside, the observations of this court in Rowan v. Toronto Railway Co.[2], and Toronto Railway Co. v. Gosnell[3] would preclude our doing more than sending the case for a new trial in view of the fact that the plaintiff's driver did not know, and even if he had looked could not have known, that the car coming towards him was travelling at an unreasonable rate of speed, and in view of it being most probable that he could have crossed the track in entire safety (as, in fact, he very nearly succeeded in doing) if the car had been travelling only at a reasonable rate of speed at the time when, according to the jury, he might and ought to have seen it.\nBut it is unnecessary to further consider this, because the jury have found, upon evidence appearing to us sufficient to warrant the finding, that notwithstanding such supposed negligence the defendants' servants could, in the result, have averted the accident by the exercise of reasonable care. If this was found upon evidence warranting it, i.e., upon evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find it, then of course the driver's act of negligence (if it existed at all) could no longer be considered as a contributing efficient cause, but would be reduced merely to a link in the chain of anterior circumstances without which the accident could not have happened.\nThe chief contention for the appellants upon this appeal was that there was an entire absence of evidence to warrant the finding that, notwithstanding negligence of the plaintiff's driver, the defendants could, in the result, by the exercise of reasonable care have avoided the accident. What is or is not reasonable care is a matter of degree and varies with circumstances. The control and management of an instrument of danger to life or limb has always been considered as calling for a higher degree of skill or care, as the measure of what is reasonable, than where no such serious consequence is to be apprehended.\nHere the defendants were running their car on a dark night, in what their servants say was a dangerous place, and upon a down grade of over eleven hundred feet in length at the point of accident, and at what the jury have found to be an excessive rate of speed; it was therefore incumbent upon them to exercise a very high degree of skill and care to control and stop the car in case of imminent danger to any one upon the highway. The evidence of Townshend, the motorman, shows that he saw the carriage attempting to cross the track when he got two car lengths from it. He had two means under his control for checking and stopping the car, the brakes, and the reversing of the electric current, the latter of which is allowed by the only company to be used in case of accident, presumably on account of its effect on the car or its machinery. The motorman first put the brakes on hard. Speaking of the time when he first saw the carriage attempting to cross the track, he says:\nI put on the brake on the car then, and as I saw that I was not going to be able to stop the car with the brake I released the brake and reversed the power on the car as the last resort. He was then, he says, about one car length from the cab. The reversing power at once checked the speed but not sufficiently to avoid the accident, and as the result one of the hind wheels of the cab was struck as it was on the point of quitting the track. Such, however, was the power of the reversing current that the car came to a standstill within a further distance of seven or eight feet.\nThe above quoted passage from the evidence of the motorman is open to the reasonable construction that he at first sought to avoid the collision by the use of the brakes only, and had recourse to what he styles \"the last resort\" only when he found that he was not going to be able to succeed by the mere use of the brake. A jury might reasonably and properly take such meaning out of the words,\nI put on the brake, and as I saw that I was not going to be able to stop the car with the brake I released the brake and reversed the power on the car as the last resort.\nThe jury may very properly have thought that, in the circumstances, the last resort ought not to have been deferred until it was evident that the use of the brake alone would not suffice; and considering that at the time of the collision the hind wheels of the cab were about quitting the track, and that in about a second it would have cleared it entirely, the jury were not restrained from drawing their own conclusions from the motorman's account of the occurrence by his subsequently expressed opinion that he thought it would have made no difference if he had reversed the power earlier.\nAnother motorman of the defendant company who was with Townshend, says that the only thing that can be done to avoid a collision is to reverse the current, and his evidence tends to support the conclusion that the reversing power ought to have been applied earlier.\nIt is impossible, we think, in view of Townshend's evidence to say that the defendants did all that they ought reasonably to have done to prevent damage happening from the unreasonable and excessive rate of speed at which they chose to run their car.\nIt is suggested that the defendants are not to be held to strict accountability for not taking the best means open to them by reason of the plaintiff having by his crossing the track put them under the necessity of acting promptly. This would be so if they had been going at a reasonable rate of speed, but it is entirely inapplicable to a case where they themselves were travelling at an unreasonable and excessive rate of speed. They deliberately tied their own hands and created for themselves the greatest difficulty they had to contend with. They ought, therefore, to have been prepared to act promptly and decisively upon an emergency such as that which arose. For these reasons we think that the appeal should be dismissed, and with costs.\nGWYNNE J. (dissenting).\u2014The plaintiff who is a cab owner doing business in the City of Halifax brings this action upon the ground as alleged in his statement of claim\nthat he has suffered damage caused by the servants of the defendant company on the 20th November, 1897, so negligently controlling or managing a train or car belonging to the defendant company that the said train or car ran into and collided with a cab or carriage drawn by two horses owned by the plaintiff and driven by plaintiff's servant.\nThe defendants besides a general denial of the cause of action as above stated pleaded specially sec. 5 of ch. 107 of the laws of Nova Scotia of 1895, by which the defendant company are reserved in the right of way in the streets where their tramways are laid, and that the plaintiff's said servant\nimproperly and negligently drove the plaintiff's said horses and cab or carriage across the track of the defendant company directly in front of the car or tram of the defendant company, which was at the time in motion and approaching said plaintiff's horses and cab or carriage; and so close in front of the defendant company's car that it was impossible to stop said car before the plaintiff's cab or carriage was struck.\nIf this plea was established to be true there cannot be entertained any doubt that the plaintiff's cause of action wholly failed, and the defendants were entitled to have had judgment rendered in their favour, and in the evidence material to the determination of the issue joined in this plea there is very little if any reliable contradiction whatever.\nAlfred Harvey, the driver of the plaintiff's cab, said that he left his home at 30 Grafton Street on the evening of the 20th November, 1897, at 6.30 o'clock, with the plaintiff's cab for the purpose of reaching the Intercolonial Railway Station which appeared to be on North Street, to meet a train which was due at 6.45. On his way along the Campbell road before reaching North Street which crossed the Campbell road he met or overtook a Mrs. Hines whom he took up for the purpose, as he said, of giving her a lift on her way home at a place called Richmond, which necessitated his pursuing a course different from his ordinary course to the station for he said that on his reaching North Street his horses tried to turn to go down North Street as he said they always do on reaching that street, but he drove straight on north along the Campbell road intending to take Mrs. Hines as far as the barrack gate (which by another of the plaintiff's witnesses, namely Mr. Doane, the city engineer, was proved to be 1,150 feet or about one-fifth of a mile distant from North Street), and to go round to the station by Water Street. He had made up his mind he said to take the lady as far as the barrack gate and to get round from thence to the station by turning across a bridge over the Intercolonial Railway, leading from the Campbell road at a point almost directly opposite the barrack gate, into Water Street, and so to get round to the station. He said that he passed North Street at twenty-three minutes to seven o'clock, as appeared by a clock which he saw in a grocery store at the corner of North Street, so that it must have been about 6.45 or the hour when the train he was to meet should be due at the station when he reached the barrack gate where, as he said, he had made up his mind to let down Mrs. Hines. He said further that he did stop and let her down just south of\u2014a few yards south of\u2014the barrack gates, there he bade a boy whom he had on the box with him to get down and let her out, that the boy did so, and got up on the box again after shutting the door of the cab, that as the boy got up he, Harvey, looked back south and saw no car, that he then turned his horses round to cross the bridge over the Intercolonial into Water Street, to do this he had to cross the tramway track; as he turned his horses he saw, he said, the shadow of a car right alongside, that he could not back his horses so he hit them with his whip and with that the car struck him. Upon the evidence of this witness it is established that the collision took place almost instantaneously upon Harvey turning his horses round after letting down Mrs. Hines and when he should have been already at the railway station to meet the train due at 6.45 which he had set out to meet.\nThis fact is also confirmed by the evidence of Mrs. Hines who was also one of the plaintiff's witnesses. She said that she got out of the cab just south of the barrack gate, that Harvey was just in the act of turning his cab when she bade him good night and started on her way home along the sidewalk northwards and that she had only got a few steps, just two or three steps past the barrack gate, when she heard some one hollering \"whoa\" whereupon she looked round and saw the car stop and the horses running down the street. Now this shout of \"whoa\" is shown by one of defendants' witnesses to have been uttered by Harvey himself after the accident had happened and after he had jumped or fallen down from the box and while he was following in pursuit of the horses running away. This witness was Joseph James Croft who was the conductor of the car who said that while the car was running on the down grade there under its own headway when just opposite the barrack gate he noticed the motorman twist his brake sharply and then release the brake and put on the reverse current that witness, as soon as he heard the brake released and felt the reverse current applied, knew that there must be something wrong ahead so he instantly jumped off the tram, and just as he jumped off the collision took place and he ran to the front of the car in time to see Harvey either jump or fall off and run in pursuit of the horses running away, shouting \"whoa back.\" He said also that from the barrack gate a car could be seen below North Street, coming up. James Whelan who was the boy with Harvey and who was also one of the plaintiff's witnesses, said that on the cab stopping at the barrack gate he got down to let the lady out and that upon letting her out he closed the door and got up on the box again with Harvey. He then said\nThe driver started to go to North Street station. Just as we were turning the car was right alongside of us. The car jumped into us.\nHe added that before the car struck them Harvey got out the whip and hit the horses.\nWitness did not know whether he himself had jumped off or was knocked off but he saw Harvey running down Lockman Street in pursuit of the horses running away and witness followed him. It was then he said a quarter to seven o'clock as he should judge.\nJames Pearce, another of the plaintiff's witnesses, said that on the evening of the accident he was walking on the western sidewalk of the Campbell road going south towards North Street, that is to say he was walking towards the cab which was coming from North Street. Witness saw the cab approaching, it passed him and stopped just south of the barrack gate, when the cab stopped witness was about four or five yards distant from the place where it stopped, he just then turned round and saw the lady getting out and as he turned round and looked at the cab he saw the tram-car coming up; it was lighted up with electric lights. Witness then turned again and proceeded on his way along the sidewalk south and, as he said, he had not got any distance at all when he heard the smash of the collision.\nMr. Doane, the city engineer, who was also a witness called by the plaintiff, testified that the width of the sidewalk on the Campbell road at the barrack gate was twelve feet six inches, and the distance from the outside line of that sidewalk to the nearest rail of the tramway is seventeen feet six inches, and that the width of the railway is five feet over all.\nThe above contains the whole of the substance of the evidence given by the plaintiff as affecting the conduct of the driver of the cab on the occasion of the accident. However the defendants who had by their statement of defence pleaded that the collision had been occasioned by the negligence and wrongful conduct of the plaintiff's servant the driver of his cab gave evidence as follows: Joseph James Croft, the conductor of the tram car, gave the evidence already mentioned as having been given by him.\nSamuel Townshend, the motorman on the tram car, which came into collision with the plaintiff's carriage, said that on the evening in question the car was going north on the Campbell road; that it was well lighted in the usual way with two side lights, head light, and four incandescent lights inside; that the lights could be seen at North Street from the barrack gate; that when it reached North Street it was 6.40 or 6.4S o'clock; that when he go opposite the nursery where the down grade increases he shut off the power as he said they always do there; that as the car proceeded he saw what, as he approached near to it and within about four car lengths (or 108 feet) of it, was a carriage on the left hand side of the road, going also north or standing he could not say which, however, just as the car got within about two lengths (or 54 feet) of it he saw the carriage instead of continuing north as its course had been start to turn round and make as it seemed to him a circle to come round and cross the track in front of the car; that was the first and only intimation the witness had of the intention of the driver to cross the track; witness immediately put on the brakes and reversed the current to check the speed of the car; that the power was reversed before the car got within a car's length (or twenty-seven feet) of the carriage, and that the speed was so effectually checked that it struck the carriage with such slight impact that the horses got away with the carriage and the car did not proceed after the collision more than seven or eight feet when it stopped wholly. Everything he said that could possibly have been done was done to stop the car after the witness had any intimation of the driver of the carriage having any intention to cross the track, but he admitted that if he had had sooner any intimation of such intention he could of course have stopped the car sooner.\nAlexander McQuinn, another motorman of the defendants, who was going home on the evening in question and was with Townshend in front upon the car confirmed Townshend's testimony in every particular, and added that when the hack turned round and proceeded to cross the track it was too late to avoid the collision, and further he said that from the road in front of the barrack gate a car could be plainly seen twenty yards south of North Street a distance of upwards of 600 feet.\nDaniel Adams on the evening in question was walking down the Campbell road on the sidewalk adjoining the barracks. He saw the hack stop and let somebody out. He saw the tram car coming along while the hack was standing at the barrack gate. He saw the boy shut the door and get up on the box again. The tram car was then so near that he did not think any body would go across the track. The hack driver then turned his horses across the track to go to the station or wherever he was going, when he turned his horses across the track of the car was not more than about fifteen feet from the hack. Witness was himself walking down to the station and when the hack turned it was so close to the car that it took the lights of the car from him. The car was making the usual noise and racket which it always makes coming down the grade there. From the front of the barrack gate he could see to the nursery which is quite a piece up towards North Street. The car was running at the usual rate at which it runs at that place and at other places in the city where there is a down grade.\nClarence Purcell was driving a parcel wagon down the Campbell road on the night in question. It was, he said, not very dark, it was just about dusk. He first saw the car coming up when he was about 200 yards from the barrack gate. He did not then notice the cab. He did not notice the cab until it turned round. He was then distant from it just the space between two telegraph poles, as soon as the cab turned across the track it got struck. Witness then drove up to the place of collision and jumped off his team when he saw Harvey, the driver, running after the horses. Witness said that he could see down to North Street all right. On cross-examination he repeated that his first sight of the cab was when it crossed in front of the car, crossing the track was the first he noticed of it. He did not see any delay about it.\nNow upon this evidence the first material question appears to have been whether or not the defendants had establised the defence pleaded in their statement of defence namely:\nThat the plaintiff's servant improperly and negligently drove said plaintiff's horses and cab or carriage across the track of the defendant company, directly in front of the car or tram of the defendant company which was at the time in motion approaching said plaintiff's horses and cab or carriage.\nUpon this question the evidence may be said to be wholly uncontradicted as to the fact of the cab having been driven across the track directly in front of an approaching car moved by electric power, and the only reasonable conclusion to be arrived at upon the evidence was, I think, that the driver of the cab being (by reason of his having gone out of his way for the purpose of giving, as he said, a lift to Mrs. Hines on her way home) late to reach the railway station so as to meet the train due at 6.40, which he set out to meet, rashly, recklessly, negligently and wrongfully drove across the track directly in front of the coming electric car, and so close to it that instantly the cab was struck by the car. The only excuse for this conduct which was attempted to be given was given by the driver himself who said that before turning the cab to cross the track he had looked up the road to see if there was a car coming, and that he saw no car and that he then turned. He was struck, however, almost immediately upon his getting on the track. Now the plaintiff had proved by a witness whose testimony was not questioned, that the distance from where the cab had stood to the nearest rail of the tramway was just seventeen feet six inches, so that the car was upon him as soon as he had proceeded that distance with his cab, and when he did see it then it was, as he said, lit up. Now the utter unreliability of this evidence, and the recklessness displayed by the witness in giving it, appeared upon his cross-examination, for he then said that when the boy was mounting up on the cab if the car had been within 100 yards of him he could have seen it, and he undertook to swear not only that he looked for the car, and did not see it, but that in point of fact it was not then within 100 yards of him, and that the car which struck him and which when he first saw it it was as he said about ten feet from him and must have run upwards of 100 yards while he was crossing the distance of seventeen feet six inches from the side wall to the tramway. Then as to the speed at which the car was running, he said on his examination in chief that\nhe guessed from the crash that he got that the car must have been going over fifteen miles an hour, from fifteen to twenty miles an hour\n(that was the only way by which he could speak of the speed of the car). Yet upon his cross-examination he admitted\nthat the cab might have been hit just as hard as it was if the car had been going only at eight miles or even less than eight miles an hour. The evidence of this witness cannot be said with any degree of reason to be entitled to any consideration whatever by reasonable men.\nNow the rule governing cases of this description is thus expressed by Lord Cairns in Slatterns Case[4], at page 1166.\nIf a train which ought to whistle when passing through a station were to pass without whistling, and a man were in broad daylight, and' without anything, either in the structure of the line or otherwise, to obstruct his view, to cross in front of an advancing train and to be killed, I think the judge ought to tell the jury that it was the folly and recklessness of the man, and not the carelessness of the company, which caused his death.\nIn the application of this rule there cannot in reason be said to be any difference between \"broad daylight\" and a dark but clear evening between six and seven o'clock, in November, as the night in question was indisputably established to be, and when by uncontradicted evidence, as was also the case here, the tram car could have been seen 400 yards away, and was in fact seen 200 yards away from the place where the collision occurred, and which the plaintiff's driver of the injured cab admitted could have been seen over 100 yards away. Then Lord Hatherly in Slattery's Case (1) was of opinion that it is negligence for a man to pass over a railway at all without looking to see whether or not a train is approaching. He said, at page 1171:\nI cannot consider it a proper question for a judge to ask a jury whether a man's walking of running across a line of railway on which a train is expected, without looking to see whether a train is in sight, be an act of negligence.\nAnd he cites with approbation the language of Willes J. pronouncing the judgment of the court in Ryder v. Wombwell[5], where he says at p. 39: It was formerly considered necessary in all cases to leave the question to the jury (whether goods furnished to an infant were necessaries), if there was any evidence, even a scintilla, in support of the case; but it is now settled that the question for the judge, (subject of course to review), is, as stated by Maule J. in Jewell v. Parr[6], not whether there is really no evidence, but whether there is some that ought reasonably to satisfy the jury that the fact sought to be proved is established.\nHe also cited with approbation the judgment of Mr. Justice Williams in Toomey v. London and Brighton Railway Co.[7], who enunciates the rule thus.\nIt is not enough to say that there was some evidence * * a scintilla of evidence * * clearly would not justify a judge in leaving the case to the jury. There must be evidence on which they might reasonably and properly conclude that there was negligence (which was the causa causans of the act complained of),\nand Lord Hatherley adds:\nIf it be said that the jurors must draw the inference of negligence from the facts, the same might be said as to their duty in drawing the inferences in an action for goods supplied to an infant, whether they are or are not necessaries regard being had to the infant's position in life, but this was not done in Ryder v. Wombwell[8].\nSo likewise upon the same principle it is for the court as matter of law to say whether there is or is not sufficient evidence to submit to the jury on a question of reasonable and probable cause in an action for malicious arrest.\nThen again in Slattery's Case [9] Lord Coleridge pronounced it to be the duty of the judge to withdraw a case from the jury if by the plaintiff's own evidence at the end of the plaintiff's case or by the unanswered and undisputed evidence on both sides at the end of the whole case it is proved either that there is no negligence of the defendants which caused the injury, or that there was negligence of the plaintiff which did, and he cites with approbation Skelton v. London & North Western Railway Co.[10]. In that cas.e the plaintiff in an action brought under Lord Campbell's Act for the death of a person killed when crossing the railway at a level crossing, was nonsuited, and the nonsuit was upheld by the Court of Exchequer upon the ground that the deceased when he reached the first line of rails could have seen up and down the line for 300 yards, but he did not look either to the right or left, but walked on and was killed crossing the second line of rails.\nLord Blackburn in Slattery's Case[11], at page 1216 made use of the following language, which seems to be exceedingly pertinent in the present case.\nMy Lords, it seems to me if we were to say that judges cannot know that it is rash to cross the railway on foot on which it was known that trains were running; without taking some precaution to ascertain that no train was coming, and therefore that a judge cannot rule that, in the absence of evidence of something to excuse it, the person so crossing cannot recover for a collision; we should in effect say that the question for the jury was whether it was not shabby in the Railway Company not to give something to the widow and orphans of the deceased. I fear too often that is the question really considered by the jury, but I think it clear it ought not to be so.\nLord Gordon in the same case (1), at page 1217 referred to The Metropolitan Railway v. Jackson [12] as settling the rule that it is for the court to determine whether there is or not reasonable evidence of negligence occasioning the injury to be submitted to the jury and that if there be not evidence from which such negligence can reasonably be inferred the case should be withdrawn from the jury, and to this effect is the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber in Siner v. Great Western Railway Co.[13]. In Davey v. London & South Western Railway Co.[14], Huddleston B. nonsuited a plaintiff who was injured by a train while crossing a railway of the defendants at a level crossing upon the ground that it appeared by the plaintiff's own evidence he crossed the line without looking to see whether there was a train approaching which he must have seen had he looked. This nonsuit was upheld by the Queen's Bench Division. Upon counsel for the plaintiff arguing that the defendants in the discharge of their duty to use ordinary and reasonable care were bound to give to the plaintiff warning of the approaching train which they did not do and by omitting to do so he was misled into a confidence that it was safe to cross, Lord Coleridge interposed the observation:\nIs it not using ordinary care to presume that where there is no obstacle to vision people will look to see if a train is coming?\nAnd in giving judgment he cited at length Lord Cairns's judgment in Slattery's case [15] at page 1166 terminating with the sentence \u2022\nthe jury could not be allowed to connect the carelessness in not whistling with the accident to a man who rushed with his eyes open on his own destruction\nand he held there was really no evidence proper to be submitted to the jury. Lord Dennan concurring with Lord Coleridge said:\nI think that the undisputed facts of this case shew that this accident was palpably and unquestionably due to the plaintiff's own folly and recklessness and nothing else.\nAnd again:\nIt seems to me that it is no answer to the contention that the accident resulted from his own folly, that there was no whistle for I do not see that the absence of a whistle played any material part in causing the accident:\nAnd again:\nIt appears to me that the plaintiff brought his injuries upon himself by his own act as much as if seeing the train coming he had tried to cross in front of it.\nOn appeal this judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal[16]. The Master of the Rolls pronouncing his judgment as to the contention that the plaintiff having been misled into a false confidence said that it was incumbent upon the plaintiff.\nto show that reasonable persons of ordinary care would have been misled under the same circumstances,\nand he held that there was no evidence proper to be submitted to a jury. Lord Justice Bowen held that there was nothing in the evidence from which any reasonable mind could draw the inference that the accident was caused by anything except the negligence of the plaintiff himself, and as to the suggestion that he had been misled by the defendants he said:\nNow what was there to mislead any reasonable person? Is there, in other words, any evidence from which the jury would have a right to consider that the plaintiff taking his own story to have been true ought to have been misled?\nAnd finally he was of opinion that the evidence did not leave open two views which could reasonably be taken of the plaintiff's conduct, and so the nonsuit was affirmed. It is true that in Wright v. The Midland Railway Co. [17]reported at the foot of Brown v. Great Western Railway Co. (1) the Master of the Rolls is reported to have said (at pages 409-410).\nIf it pleases any body to hear it I have doubted ever since I gave that judgment (re Davey v. London & South Western Railway Co. [18]whether my brother Baggallay and my brother Manisty were not more right than we were. I have doubted whether even in that case we ought to have taken it from the jury.\nBut his doubt did not detract from the rule of law as laid down in that case but in its application as to the facts of the case; his doubt being whether upon the evidence it was not open to the jury reasonably to hold that the conduct of the defendants excused the plaintiff \"from taking the precaution which he otherwise should and would have taken.\" He premises the above observation by saying:\u2014 There was no dispute about the law in the matter, the only difference being as to what was the conclusion of fact, and we thought the man ought to have seen. My brother Baggalay and my brother Manisty thought he should have been excused for not looking. By which I understand the learned Master of the Rolls that they thought it was a question proper to be submitted to the jury whether he was not to be so excused. It was upon this question of fact alone that the Master of the Rolls changed his mind as to the propriety of withdrawing the case from the jury, and that change of mind cannot I think in the slightest degree affect our minds in the present case. In the case of Wright v. The Midland Railway Co. [19]there did appear to be open upon the evidence the two views referred to by Lord Justice Bowen in Davey v London & South Western Railway Co. [20]as necessary to justify submission of the question to the jury. The Master of the Rolls on the appeal in Wright v. Midland Railway Co. (1) adopts the language of Field J. in that case when in the Queen's Bench Division[21]. The Master of the Rolls has no doubt as to the rule of law, giving judgment he says at page 407\nI am not going to attempt to lay down what the law on this matter is again because it seems to me to have been laid down in the clearest language many times and as Mr. Justice Lopes says (and I am sure I will not gainsay it) beautifully laid down by Mr. Justice Field in this case. All I can say is that I do not think Mr. Justice Field in this case has added one single word as a legal proposition to what everybody had agreed to years before. Let [me see what Mr. Justice Field's proposition is\u2014\"I say I may take it into my own hands when no reasonable jury acting fairly and impartially between the plaintiff and the defendant ought to draw or would draw any but one conclusion and that conclusion is conclusive against the plaintiff.\"\nIt is apparent then that upon the rule of law there was no difference of opinion whatever between the Master of the Rolls and Mr. Justice Field. They differed only as to the application of the rule to the facts in evidence in the case before them. Mr. Justice Field in a very full and exhaustive review of the evidence concludes by saying [22]\nNow I have not the faintest doubt in this case. I think that the case, at the end of the plaintiff's evidence, disclosed such a want of care on the part of the deceased as to disentitle the plaintiff to recover.\nMr. Justice Manisty who differed from the Master of the Rolls in Davey v. London & South Western Railway Co. [23]concurred with the judgment of Mr. Justice Field, he expressed himself of opinion that the evidence disclosed no evidence whatsoever of any negligence of the defendants which caused the death of Wright, the deceased. Lord Justice Lopes in the strongest terms expressed his concurrence in the judgment of Mr. Justice Field, and said [24]\nI doubt very much whether a more able and exhaustive judgment, with regard to what is \"contributory negligence\" and to the question when negligence or contributory negligence ought to be left to or withdrawn from the jury, exists in any of the books, than that which has just been delivered by my learned brother Field,\nand the rule was made absolute for judgment for the defendants although the trial judge had submitted the case to the jury who had rendered a verdict for the plaintiff. The Master of the Rolls then in his judgment in Wright v. The Midland Railway Co. [25]proceeded to point out several points in the evidence as to negligence both on the part of the defendants and of the deceased which appeared to him to present two views upon which reasonable men might, in his opinion, differ as to the cause of the accident which caused the death of the deceased. Lord Justice Baggalay concurred with the Master of the Rolls and so the appeal was allowed. Lord Justice Lindley who concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Field upon the facts dissenting. Brown v. Great Western Railway Co.[26], was a similar case and proceeded ultimately upon the authority of the above case of Wright v. The Midland Railway Co. [27]in appeal. Then there is the case of Coyle v. Great Northern Railway Co. [28]in the Irish Exchequer Court in 1887 which is very much in point and in which Chief Baron Pallas reviewed all of the above cases including the judgment of the Master of the Rolls in Wright v. The Midland Railway Co. (2). It was an action under Lord Campbell's Act for the death of a person killed when crossing the Great Northern Railway Company where carriages were at the time being shunted. It appears from the evidence of the plaintiff's witnesses that the view from the place where the deceased was standing to the point from which the carriages began to retrograde was unobstructed; that they were visible during the shunting to any person standing at the place where the deceased was; that they were retrograding in the direction of the deceased when he started to cross the line, and that he must have seen them moving had he looked towards them; and that there was nothing unusual in what took place that morning in the mode of shunting; and it was held that the judge at the trial ought to have directed a verdict for the defendants as he undisputed facts shewed that the deceased in crossing the track acted negligently and that his negligence if not the sole, was at least a contributory cause of the accident. Pallas C.B. delivering his judgment pointed out the unquestionable and apparent fact that the accident could not have happened but for the deceased being there, and that his negligence in being there was at least a causa sine qua non of his death. There was nothing he said amounting to a statement by the company that the deceased might safely cross; there was no evidence of any negligence of the defendants but for which the consequences to the deceased could have been obviated and that therefore the judge was bound to withdraw the case from the jury upon proof of the negligence of the deceased. Douse J. concurring with the Chief Baron's judgment said\nthere was no evidence from which a jury might or might not infer that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence\u2014the evidence was all one way\u2014the deceased could and should have seen the train and thus have escaped injury.\nThen there is the case of Allen v. The North Metropolitan Tramways Co.[29]. The material facts in that case as appearing in the plaintiff's evidence were that on a snowy night in December, about 11 o'clock, the plaintiff was on the Stratford highway on the Bow and Stratford bridge. He was about to cross the road and had gone about two and one half paces into the roadway when he was knocked down and run over by one of the defendants tram-cars proceeding from Stratford to London, his legs broken and he received other injuries and for these he brought his action for damages by negligence. At the trial before Mr. Baron Hudderston it appeared in the plaintiff's case that he was not looking in the direction from which the tram came, and if he had looked he must have seen it; the plaintiff however said that it was usual for the tram-car to stop on the bridge and that he expected this tram-car would do the same. Upon this evidence Mr. Baron Huddleston withdrew the case from the jury and nonsuited the plaintiff. The Divisional Court was of opinion that there was some evidence to go to the jury and set aside the nonsuit and made an order for a new trial. On an appeal to the Court of Appeal Lord Justice Lindley pronounced the unanimous judgment of the court and said that they had all come to the conclusion that the nonsuit was right.\nThere was, he said, some evidence that the car was going fast and there was evidence that the plaintiff did not hear the car coming owing perhaps to the ground being covered with snow. It was clear from these facts that the plaintiff had only himself to blame for the accident. In the first place the court could hardly go to the length of saying that there was no evidence of negligence in the driver of the car, though that evidence was of the slightest possible character. On the other hand there was clear evidence that the plaintiff's conduct caused the accident; he walked into the tram-car when if he had looked he must have seen it. Then even though the plaintiff was negligent could the driver have avoided the accident by the exercise of reasonable care. They could find no evidence that the driver could have avoided the accident.\nThe appeal was therefore allowed and judgment rendered for the defendants in the action. Then there is the case in the Privy Council, also in 1887, on appeal from the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Commissioner for Railways v. Brown[30]. I extract a portion of the judgment of the Privy Council which was pronounced by Lord Fitzgerald to shew the rationale upon which the judgment proceeded. He says at p. 135.\nWhat really took place seems to have probably been that the plaintiff was driving down Elizabeth street and his horse got into an excited state from the noise of children. One of the witnesses says that when the plaintiff could have seen the motor coming he rose in his seat and commenced slashing his horse. The object of that was that having a spirited horse he thought that spirited horse would have carried him clear of the motor by being a little accelerated and then he commenced accelerating the pace of the horse so as to rush past the motor. He had no business to do that. When he saw there was danger of collision his duty was at once to have held his horse in. It was a matter of seconds. The delay of a few seconds would have prevented the calamity, but he chose to make a rush across, and in fact instead of the motor running into him he ran into the motor.\nThis latter language is emphatically applicable to the evidence of what occurred in the present case The decisions in the Ontario courts proceed on the same principle; Danger v. London Street Railway Co.[31]; and I do not of course cite this case as an authority binding in any sense upon this court, but because I entirely concur in the judgment pronounced in it. The action was against a street railway company for negligence. It appeared that an electric car of the defendants was being run at a very rapid rate, and that the gong was not sounded as the car approached a certain street at the junction of which the plaintiff who was driving a horse along the same street and in the same direction in which the car was going, turned in front of the car to cross the rails when a wheel of the vehicle was struck by the car and he was injured. It also appeared that he did not before turning look or listen to ascertain the position of the car although he knew it was coming. The learned trial judge upon this evidence nonsuited the plaintiff. Upon a motion to set aside that nonsuit and for a new trial the Divisional Court affirmed the nonsuit.\nThen there is Follet v. The Toronto Street Railway Co.[32] which proceeded upon the express authority of Allen v. North Metropolitan Tramway Co.[33]. The case there was left to the jury who rendered a verdict for the plaintiff; a divisional court refused to set aside that verdict, but on appeal the majority of the court being of opinion that there was no evidence of the defendants' negligence which was proper to be left to the jury, that is to say, none from which a jury could reasonably find a verdict against the defendants for negligence, set aside the judgment and ordered judgment to be entered for the defendants, Osier J. dissenting upon the point only that he thought there was evidence from which a jury might fairly find a verdict against the defendants.\nNow upon the evidence as it stood at the close of the whole case I cannot entertain a doubt that the only conclusion which reasonable men could fairly deduce from the evidence was that the driver of the plaintiff's cab by his own rash, reckless and wrongful conduct into which he was not misled by any conduct of the defendants, was the sole cause of the accident which occurred, the case was one, to use the language of Lord Fitzgerald in 13 App. Cas. 135, of the cab driver running into the motor instead of the motor running into him. But we need not dwell upon this, for the learned trial judge submitted the case to the jury, who have expressly found that the cab driver, to say the least, did by negligent and improper conduct in attempting to cross the railway as he did just in front of the coming motor contribute to the causing of the accident and the injury suffered. That finding is conclusive, and upon it and upon the authority of all the cases upon the principle governing cases of this kind the learned trial judge should have entered judgment for the defendants, for there was not a shadow of evidence upon which reasonable men could fairly say that the motorman was guilty of negligence in omitting to do something which he could and should have done, and which, it done, would have obviated the consequences of the cab driver's wrongful conduct. Nothing of the kind was attempted to be proved at the trial; the only intimation which the motorman had of the cab driver having any intention to cross the track was his turning from the sidewalk where the cab had been standing and making straight for the railway. Now the evidence of the defendant's witnesses, and there was no contradiction whatever of that evidence, was that instantaneously upon the cab driver so exhibiting an intention to cross the track the motorman put on his brakes hard, and reversed the electric current, which latter was completely effected before the car got within a car's length, or twenty-seven feet of the place where the collision occurred. There was, I say, no contradiction whatever of these statements, but what counsel for the plaintiff attempted to do was to extract from the motorman on cross-examination whether, if he had applied the brakes and reversed the current sooner than he did, the car might not have been stopped before it reached the place where the collision took place. To this the motorman naturally replied that if he had any intimation of the intention of the cab driver to cross in front of him he could have stopped the car sooner than it was stopped, but there was not a particle of evidence that he did not do all that he possibly could do the moment he had any intimation of the cab driver's intention to cross the railway, that is to say the moment he turned from the sidewalk where he had been standing, just seventeen feet six inches distant from the rail upon which the cab was struck. Now it does not require the authority of any decided case to shew that the motorman having done nothing to stop the car before he had any intimation of the intention of the cab driver to cross the track, could not by any reasonable man or in law be held to be negligence contributing to an accident which could not have taken place if the plaintiff's driver had not negligently and wrongfully placed himself in a position to bring upon himself the danger of the collision which did take place.\nIt was argued before us that the speed at which it was suggested that the motor was running, namely at, as was suggested from fifteen to twenty miles an hour, excused the plaintiff's conduct If the motor was running at such a rate of speed the attempt of the cab driver to cross in front of it was only the more culpable and could not affect the question whether after the cab driver had wrongfully attempted to cross the track the motorman omitted to do something which he could and should have done, which if done would have avoided the consequences of the cab driver's wrongful act. But in truth there was not anything said at the trial as to the speed of the motor which reasonable men could fairly regard as entitled to any consideration whatever as contradictory of the evidence given by the defendants upon that point, that the motor was going at its ordinary rate not exceeding about eight miles an hour, and in fact at the particular place in question it was going down a descending grade under its own headway and at the ordinary rate it always runs there and at all other places in the city at similar down grades. I have shewn how utterly valueless was the opinion of Harvey, the cab driver on the question of speed; the only other witness who said anything upon the question of speed of the motor was Pearce, who ventured to say that he judged that the motor was going at the rate of from fifteen to twenty miles an hour, but on cross-examination he said that while he was walking along for a distance of about forty yards the motor had just moved the distance of what he called 100 yards, thus showing the rate of speed of the motor to be just about what the defendants' witness stated, whose testimony was confirmed by the rapidity with which the car was stopped, and the short distance it continued to run after the brakes were applied. But the speed at which the car was going being only an item of consideration upon the question of the defendants' negligence, and as it is quite immaterial whether the defendants had been guilty of any negligence prior to the wrongful conduct of the cab driver to cross in front of the car, it is unnecessary to dwell upon this point. The defendants were clearly entitled to judgment upon the finding of the jury as no reasonable men could find otherwise than that the wrongful conduct of the plaintiffs cab driver contributed at least to the accident, and there was not a particle of evidence that the defendants were guilty of any negligence in omitting to do anything which if done would have obviated the consequences of the defendant's misconduct. The answer of the jury to the third question submitted to them is utterly unsupported by any evidence, and can, I think, be attributed solely to some such motive as that suggested by Lord Blackburn in Slattery's Case[34] as too often influencing juries to render verdicts in cases of this kind against the evidence. I cannot entertain any doubt that the appeal should be allowed with costs and judgment be ordered to be entered for the defendants in the action with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

C.\u2014Employer's liability.\nTo permit an unnecessary quantity of dynamite to accumulate in dangerous proximity to employees of a mining company, in a situation where opportunity for damage might occur either from the nature of the substance or through carelessness or otherwise is such negligence on the part of a mining company as will render it liable in damages for the death of an employee from an explosion of the dynamite, though the direct cause of such explosion may be unknown. Gwynne J. dissenting.\nAt the doctrine of common employment does not prevail in the Province of Quebec acts or omissions by fellow servants of the deceased do not exonerate employers from liability for the negligence of a servant which may have led to injury.

S.C.R. 42) followed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada sitting in review at Montreal affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Saint Francis, which maintained the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe action was brought by the plaintiff for damages in her own behalf as widow of the late Theodore Rivard, deceased and also in her quality of tutrix on behalf of the minor children of the deceased in consequence of his death which occurred through an explosion of dynamite caused, as was alleged, by the fault of the defendant under the following circumstances:\nThe deceased was employed by the defendant as driver of a compressor engine used in working drills in a mine. The engine was in a wooden building contiguous to and connected with which was another wooden building in which there were four steam engines used to work the derricks. In the latter building, on the day of the accident, a quantity of dynamite had been placed which exploded during the dinner hour killing the deceased, who was then eating his dinner in the compressor building, and also two other employees who appeared to have been, at the time, in or about the adjoining engine house. The evidence shewed that the defendant used large quantities of dynamite or dualine, which is a high explosive, kept usually in a frozen state and requiring to be thawed out to fit it for use. It explodes at 360\u00b0 F. or through friction and in order to reduce the frozen sticks to pasty consistency for immediate use they were placed in the engine room near the steam pipe where the heat ranged between 90\u00b0 and 100\u00b0 F. The dynamite was stored in an isolated magazine about 1000 feet from the engine house, carried thence in wooden boxes and laid in a Specially constructed zinc case in quantities generally of two boxes at a time when being shewed out for use but at the time of the accident there were two unopened wooden boxes of dynamite in the engine room besides about the same quantity in the zinc case and no person had been placed particularly in charge of it or of the engine house during the dinner hour. This building was open on all sides and could be freely entered At the time of the accident, one of the victims who had been sent by the foreman into the building to get some of the dualine and fulminating caps was seen coming rapidly out of the engine house door and crying \"fire ! fire!\" and the explosion followed immediately with the fatal results already stated.\nThe actual cause of the explosion of the dynamite was not proved but theories were advanced of spontaneous explosion arising from proximity to the steam pipes, or fire set to rubbish by carelessness generating sufficient heat to explode the dynamite. The plaintiff charged the defendant with imprudence in allowing so large a quantity of dynamite to remain unguarded in such a dangerous place and for neglect to make proper arrangements and provide facilities to prepare it for use in some isolated situation\nThe trial court maintained the action and awarded $1,000 damages to the plaintiff personally and an additional $1,000 damages on behalf of the children and found that the deceased had not been guilty of contributory negligence, that the cause of the explosion was unknown and that imprudence and neglect on the part of the defendant had been established by the evidence.\nThe Court of Review affirmed the trial court judgment and considered that the defendant was in fault in imprudently placing so large a quantity of dynamite in the engine room without anyone to take charge of it, especially while the engineers had gone away for dinner. The defendant appealed from the latter judgment.\nLaflamme for the appellant cited Montreal Rolling Mills Co. V. Corcoran ([1]) ; Mercier V. Morin ([2]) ; Dominion Cartridge Co. v.

Connell ([16]).\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by :\nKING J.\u2014Assuming it to be reasonable as between\nthe mine owners and their servant that the dynamite needed for immediate use in the mines should be taken from the magazine to the hoisting engine house at the pit's mouth there to be thawed out in preparation for use the evidence still shows that an unnecessary large quantity was accumulated there at the time of the explosion.\nThe dynamite (or dualine as this preparation of it was called) as received from the manufacturers was contained in wooden boxes of from 18 to 20 inches in length by 15 by 9. The dynamite in each box weighed about 50 pounds, and was in the shape of sticks, of which there were sixty or seventy in each box. It was purchased by defendants in large quantities from the manufacturers, and was stored in a magazine constructed for the purpose upon defend ant's premises at a safe distance from the works having regard to the possibility of an explosion.\nIt appears from the evidence of \"Williams the superintendent of the mine, that the daily average use was about four boxes and that the course of business was that a person specially entrusted with the duty would, in the morning and again at noon, carry two of the boxes from the magazine to the hoisting engine room, were they would be deposited in a certain manner near a steam pipe for the purpose of being thawed, the temperature of the sticks being originally at about 40 Fahrenheit. This transfer of two boxes at each of these stated periods instead of the entire number for the day at one time, evidently points to this as being in the opinion and practice of the company a reasonable limit to the quantity to be accumulated in proximity to the works.\nThe like conclusion follows upon the fact that the company with a view to safety had prepared a specially constructed zinc box in which to place the dynamite brought from the magazine, and that the capacity of this was limited to that of two of the original boxes. It consisted of two zinc boxes placed one inside the other, with an air space of a couple of inches all around between the two and as thus constructed it is stated by the superintendent to be the best sort of a receptacle for the purpose. In ordinary course when the two original boxes were brought from the magazine their contents were transferred to the zinc box.\nThe following appears in the examination of the superintendent :\nQ. Did you ever have, to your knowledge, more dynamite in that building than you absolutely required for the daily use ?\nA. It has happened that there has been some left from the night that has not been used up that day.\nQ. As a rule there never was more than two or three boxes ?\nA. No sir.\nNow it appears that at the time of the explosion, although half the working day was over, there were nearly four boxes in the hoisting engine house. The zinc box capable of containing two of the original boxes, was nearly full, and there were also, upon the platform beside it two other of the original boxes which had not been opened at all, in all a quantity of between 150 and 200 pounds in weight.\nThe defendants produced an expert witness named Penhale, the manager of another asbestos mine. It appears that at his works the magazine was 1,500 feet distant from other buildings, and that the thawing out process was carried on in a small building separate from others which, when not in use, was kept locked. upon his direct examination the following occurs :\nQ. How many times a day or a week do you carry a certain quantity of dynamite from the magazine to the distributing point ? A. It is usually brought down a box at a time. Q. And when this box is used up ? A. More is brought down.\nThen on cross-examination :\nQ. What quantity at a time do you allow to be kept in the distributing building ?\nA. Only a box at a time, and, as it is used, it is replaced. Clearly, therefore, upon the evidence adduced by the defendants themselves there was, at the time of the explosion, an unnecessary and unreasonable quantity of this highly dangerous explosive in dangerous proximity to the workmen engaged in carrying on their work ; and no attempt is made to excuse or explain the circumstance.\nThe n\u00e9gligence involved in this was one of the efficient causes of Rivard's death which as admitted and as found, was caused by the explosion that in fact took place, and was not the conjectural consequence of a smaller explosion.\nThe peril to life from high explosives is so great and as shown by the evidence, the cause of their explosion frequently so obscure, that damage may fairly be anticipated as likely to ensue from the act of one who accumulates an unusual and unreasonable quantity in dangerous proximity to others. In placing it where an opportunity for damage may be created, either by the nature of the substance or by fortuitous circumstance or neglect of others or other cause, he takes the chance of the happening of such other event and cannot disconnect himself from the fairly to be anticipated consequences of his own negligence.\nIt hence becomes unnecessary to determine as to other agencies contributing to the result, provided it appears that neither the deceased (nor any one whose act or omission may prove a legal bar) had any connection with it and that he is not precluded from urging defendant's neglect.\nThen as to whether Rivard had any part in causing the explosion ; he was employed as engineer in a wholly distinct but contiguous building, and his body was found more remote from the point of explosion than the farthest limits of his engine house. Besides, the fact that victuals were found in his mouth shows (as stated by the superintendent) that he was eating his dinner when the explosion took place, and the court below naturally acquitted him of all participation in the cause of the explosion.\nThen as to the acts or omissions of fellow servants. According to the French law common employment is no defence, and does not exonerate the employer from liability for the negligence of a servant who may by his negligence have caused an accident from which another servant has suffered\u00bb This has been held more than once in this court. The Queen v. Filion ([17]) The Queen v. Grenier ([18]). Nor was the deceased a consenting party to the excessive quantity of dynamite being deposited near him, for the evidence shews that the deposit of such a quantity was contrary to the usual course of business.\nIn the declaration, (after averring that the explosion which caused the death was that of at least three boxes of dualine, in the building contiguous to that occupied by the deceased,) it is averred that\nit was an act of gross neglect on the part of the defendant to leave such a large quantity of explosive matter, such as dualine, m the said building, and the death of the said Theodore Rivard resulted from, and was due to the carelessness, gross neglect, and fault of the said defendant.\nIn what has been adduced there is proof of this allegation and hence the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J. (dissenting).\u2014If this case were not concluded by authority I must confess that I should have reason to distrust my own judgment in hesitating to concur in a judgment in which so many of my learned brothers as well in the courts of the Province of Quebec, as in this court, so unanimously concur. However, I am bound to say that in my opinion, the case is concluded by the authority of this court in Several cases, and by the authority of all the courts in England in very many cases wherein the principles governing the determination of cases of the nature of that now under consideration are clearly laid down, to all of which authorities the judgment in the present case is, in my opinion, directly adverse. That judgment appears to me to introduce a wholly new principle for the determination of actions like the present one, namely, that although the cause of the explosion which occasioned the injury complained of is admitted to be absolutely unknown, it is nevertheless to be presumed that the explosion was caused by some negligence of the defendant, that is to say, that some negligence of the defendant was the cause causans of the explosion and that the onus of removing this presumption is cast upon the defendant. This, with great deference, appears to me to amount to the proclamation of the doctrine that upon the defendant was cast the onus of showing the actual cause of the explosion which is admitted to be absolutely unknown.\nIt has been judicially declared over and over again that in actions of this nature the inquiry is whether the defendants were guilty of negligence which was the cause cousins of the accident which occasioned the injury complained of, that is to say, in the present case, was the cause cousins of the explosion which killed Rivard the deceased husband of the plaintiff. In the statement of claim the only matter which is charged as the negligence of the defendant, the now appellant, which was complained of, was the mere fact of having the explosive material which consisted of dynamite in the building where the explosion took place, which killed Rivard, and two other employees of the appellant, namely Pierre Ratt\u00e9 and Alphonse Morin. It was not contended that there was any positive provision of law which made it to be unlawful for the defendant to use the dynamite in the manner in which it was being used, or to have it in the building where it was when the explosion took place, but at the trial in the Superior Court several suggestions were made on behalf of the plaintiff as to the actual cause of the . explosion and, among them, that it had occurred in some unexplained manner by spontaneous combustion. If it had been so caused it did not clearly appear how such a cause of the explosion could be attributed as actionable negligence in the defendant, but this is unimportant now, for the evidence established sufficiently the absolute impossibility of dynamite being exploded by spontaneous combustion, and this suggestion as well as the others made on behalf of the plaintiff were rejected by the learned judge of the Superior Court as wholly inadmissible. The learned judge in pronouncing his judgment thus expresses himself :\nLa cause determinate de la mort a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'exposions de la dynamite mais comment cette explosion a eu lieu, personne ne peut le dire l'expert Brainerd n'a Pu l'expliquer, et sur ce sujet nous sommer absolument dans les t\u00e9n\u00e8bres.\nIn another place the learned judge says :\nWe have to occupy ourselves not so much with the direct cause of the explosion, as with its consequences ; it is of little consequent how the explosion had occurred or what was the cause of it.\nThe material question he thought was :\nWould it have taken place if the defendant had taken prudent measures and ordinary precautions ?\nBut with deference, the actual cause of the explosion is the very essential point with which we have to deal in the present action, the very gist of which is to establish that cause to be due to the negligence of the defendants as the cause cousins of the explosion and with the consequences of the explosion we cannot intelligently and judicially deal until we know its cause. Moreover, in order to determine whether prudent precautionary measures to prevent the explosion which occurred had been taken, it is necessary to know what it was that caused the explosion, for by that cause the nature, character and sufficiency of the precautionary measures that should have been taken to prevent the explosion must be tested. Otherwise the happening of the explosion must be taken as conclusive evidence of its having been caused by the negligence of the defendant.\nThe learned judire, while rejecting the suggestions made on behalf of the plaintiff as to the cause of the explosion came himself to the conclusion that the explosion was caused by fire kindled by the ashes of pipes, by matches or in some other way before the engineers had left off work at 12 o'clock. This fire, as he held had remained latent during some time and developed itself and produced the heat requisite to cause the explosion, that is to say 360\u00b0 F. for by the evidence it had appeared that for fire to cause the explosion of dynamite, it was necessary that a heat of 360\u00b0 F. should be attained. The sole evidence upon which this theory of the explosion having been caused by pre-existing fire was rested consisted of evidence which was given to the effect that Morin, one of the persons killed by the explosion, and who had just reached the door of the building and was about to enter therein when the explosion took place, cried out \"fire\" upon the instant of the explosion taking place, and was killed.\nNow, with the greatest deference, it appears to me that this theory of pre-existing fire, caused in the manner suggested, having been the cause cousins of the explosion belongs as much to the region of conjecture and surmise as did the theory of spontaneous combustion, and the other theories put forward on the part of the plaintiff and which were rejected by the learned judge as inadmissible. Moreover, the evidence had shown that when the engineers left oil working at 12 o'clock for their dinner everything was in a good and safe condition, and further assuming that a pre-existing fire caused in the manner suggested was the causa cousans of the explosion, it was as reasonable to conclude that such fire was caused by ashes from pipes or by matches in the hands of the deceased Rivard or of some other of the employees of the defendant who were in the buildings before the engineers stopped work at 12 o'clock, or in the hands of those who remain in the building after twelve o'clock. All however is mere conjecture and surmise. In the Dominion Cartridge Co. v. Cairns ([19]), this court was of opinion that for the determination of that case,\nit was sufficient to say that the evidence shews that the explosion originated at the press which was at the time being worked by Cairns, (the deceased,) and that the evidence not only does not warrant an adjudication that the explosion was not caused by any negligence on the part of Cairns, but on the contrary does warrant the fair pre sumption that it was caused by his negligence. if not caused by his negligence the evidence fails to shew what did in fact cause it, and it cannot therefore oeimputed to the defendants.\nThis contains the very gist and substance of that decision, and, if I am not mistaken, the Privy Council refused leave to appeal from that judgment ([20]).\nThe last sentence in the above judgment appears to describe precisely the condition of the present case in this, that the actual cause of the explosion is still a matter absolutely unknown and it cannot therefore be judicially pronounced that the explosion was caused by negligence of the defendant. So likewise, and for the same reason the judgment in the present case appears to me to be in direct conflict with the unani mous judgment of this court in the Canada Paint Co. v. Trainor ([21]) wherein the court said :\nThe utmost that the evidence warrants is that the cause of the accident still is as it was at the close of the plaintiff's case a matter merely sp\u00e9culative and conjectural\nand for that reason the appeal was allowed.\nSo likewise and for the same reason the \"judgment in the present case now before us in appeal appears to be directly at variance with the judgment of this court in The Montreal Rolling Mills Go. v. Corcoran ([22]) and the principle there enunciated as governing actions of like nature as the present and indeed at variance with all the judgments of this court and of the courts in England in cases like the present.\nIn Tooke v. Bergeron ([23]) an appeal was allowed by this court because it was not shewn sufficiently in the evidence that the cause of the accident was directly due to the negligence of the defendant, appellant. So likewise in Cowans v. Masshall ([24]), which was the case of injury caused by explosion, and wherein the principles governing cases of this nature as established in the English courts, were discussed, an appeal was allowed because the evidence failed to prove the cause of the explosion. So likewise in the Canada Coloured Cotton Mills Co. v. Kervin ([25]), the latest case in this court upon the question under consideration. The case was of a person employed in a cotton factory being caught by the machinery and killed. The case of the plaintiff, the personal representative and widow of the deceased, was that the deceased was caught by the machinery at the place where in the course of his duty he was engaged, and that he had been so caught by reason of the default and neglect of the appellants in not having the place where the deceased was engaged in the discharge of his duty sufficiently protected. The case of the appellants was that there was no evidence of the accident having been caused at the place suggested by the plaintiff, and that the accident might have occurred at a different part of the machinery where the deceased had no business to be, and the court allowed the appeal upon the ground that the evidence failed to establish the cause of the accident and how it had occurred. This is the latest case in this court and in it the principle is unequivocally affirmed that if the actual cause cousins of the catastrophe which causes injury to any one is unknown, judgment cannot be recovered against the defendant upon a charge of his negligence having caused the accident.\nIt is suggested that the quantity of dynamite which was in the building at the time of the explosion was greater than should have been allowed to be there, but there is nothing in the judgment asserting a contention, nor anything in the evidence to support a contention that the quantity of the dynamite in the building had, or could have had any effect in causing the explosion.\nIn fine the judgment of the Superior Court appears to me to amount to this, that although the actual cause of the explosion is absolutely unknown, and although no cause can be suggested for it which rests upon anything else than conjecture and surmise, still as the explosion could not have taken place in the building if the dynamite had not been there, this is sufficient to require the court to pronounce a judgment that the explosion was caused by negligence of the defendant. If the judgment of the Superior Court be maintained by this court it appears to me to be so in conflict with all the judgments heretofore rendered by this court in cases of a like nature with the present, as to cause the very greatest confusion in applying the judgments of this court to cases of a like nature in the future.\nI am therefore of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the action in the court below dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismised with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Greenshields Greenshields, Laflamme & Dickson.\nSolicitor for the respondent : L.

The assent of the donee or even his knowledge of the delivery is not requisite.\nDelivery of the keys of the desk containing the property to be donated constitutes an actual delivery of such property and transfers the possession of and dominion over the same.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment for the plaintiffs at the trial.\nThe action in this case was brought by the respondents as administrators of the estate of the late Archibald Walker to recover damages for the conversion and detention by defendant of certain promissory notes and other property alleged to belong to the estate.\nThe deceased Archibald Walker was endeavouring to dispose of his property after his death without making a will. To accomplish this he placed certain promissory notes in envelopes addressed to each of his five children. These envelopes with their contents he kept in a desk at his bedside for some years locked up and under his control. Shortly before his death, when he believed he would die, he had the envelopes in which the notes were, taken from the desk and handed to one Dodge, who was directed by him to seal up the envelopes and replace them in the desk and lock it. Then he delivered the keys to Dodge to retain until after his death when he instructed him to deliver to each of his children one of the envelopes so addressed. These envelopes in Dodge's presence as well as in deceased's presence were sealed up some time before his death, and afterwards Dodge delivered them to the respective donees as directed. The sole question is whether this was a donatio caus\u00e2 mortis good in law.\nThe court below and the trial judge held that Dodge was a mere agent of the deceased and that there was therefore no delivery of the property for defendant's benefit. Defendant then appealed to this court.\nRoscoe Q. C. for the appellant. The judgments below were wrong in holding that Dodge was the servant of deceased in accepting delivery of the donation. See Drury v. Smith[2]; Moore v. Darton[3]; Sessions v Moseley[4]. Dodge could be made the agent of the donee without the latter's assent and even without his knowledge. Drury v. Smith[5].\nAs a matter of fact the property itself was delivered to Dodge but it would have been sufficient if only the key of the desk containing it had been delivered. Jones v. Selby[6]; Murtapha v. Westlake[7]; Trimmer v. Danby[8]; Hall v. Hall[9].\nJ. J. Ritchie Q.C. for the respondents. The findings of fact by the trial judge will not be disturbed unless clearly wrong; Colonial Securities Trust Co. v. Massey[10]; and they are entirely supported by the evidence.\nDelivering is essential to gifts of this class; Irons v. Smallpiece[11]; Cochrane v. Moore[12]; and there was no sufficient delivery to Dodge; Powell v. Hellicar[13].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The sole question in this case is as to the sufficiency of the delivery of the notes in question by Archibald Walker to James S. Dodge, to constitute a good donatio mortis caus\u00e2. All the other requisites of such a gift are proved.\nIt is well established by authority that a delivery to a third person for the use of the beneficiary is sufficient. If, however, the third person is a mere trustee, agent or servant of the donor the delivery to him is insufficient.\nSuch a gift is always revocable by the donor and of course entirely fails if he recovers from the illness from which he is suffering at the time he makes the donation It is inaccurate to say that the delivery must be to an agent or trustee for the donee, No one can be an agent or trustee for another without that person's assent. Then the cases show that the delivery to the third person [is sufficient without the assent or even the knowledge of the donee provided it is for the use of the donee. Indeed the very sense and object of a delivery to a third person is in some cases because the donee is not at hand to give his assent. Therefore the assent of the donee or even his knowledge of a delivery to a third person for his behoof is not an essential requisite provided the donor parts with both the possession and dominion over the subject of the gift in order that the depositee may hold it for the use of the donee. Chief Justice Shaw in Sessions v. Moseley[14] in his definition of a donatio mortis caus\u00e2 is careful to avoid the loose and inaccurate language sometimes used by text writers and even in reported cases which requires that the third person must be an agent or trustee for the donee though the latter may know nothing of him. In the case referred to it is said \"there was an actual delivery to a person for the use of the donee\" thus treating such a delivery as sufficient in law without any requirement of agency or trusteeship for the donee at the time of delivery.\nThen the evidence here being not contradicted the question is entirely one of its sufficiency to show that the donor, Archibald Walker, transferred the possession of and dominion over the notes in question to Dodge. The delivery of possession does not depend on the handing over of the keys of the bureau or desk alone, for the notes were previously taken out of the box and replaced there by Dodge himself after the sealing of the envelopes. However had there been no delivery except that of the keys, that would by itself have constituted an actual and not a mere symbolical delivery and the possession and dominion over the securities contained in the desk would have been thus acquired by Dodge. A great number of cases may be cited in support of this view; it is sufficient however to refer to one or two. Sessions v. Moseley[15] already referred to, is exactly in point; Marshall v. Berry[16] is to the like effect. Indeed there is no dispute as to the delivery being sufficient if (to put in negatively) it is to the third person not as an agent or trustee for the donor but for the use of the donee. Moore v. Darton[17] is an English authority the principle of which applied to the undisputed facts in evidence here is conclusive against the judgment of the court below. Many other cases might be quoted but they do not affect the rule of law, but are only instances of the application of that rule to varying states of fact.\nMoreover, as in the case before us as the donee happened to be present and assented to the gift an actual trust in his favour was constituted.\nIt is out of the question to say that there was here any proof of agency or trusteeship for the donor, or of anything short of an actual delivery of the notes and a parting with the dominion over them to Dodge for the use of the donees after the testator's death.\nThe case in Beavan much relied on for the respondent, Powell v. Hellicar[18] as reported is so much at variance with other authorities that we must decline to follow it. Possibly it is not fully reported. We need not say more as Mr. Justice Townshend has written a very full and able judgment in which the case is discussed as regards both the facts and the law and with which we all agree.

Girouard J. dubitante.\nMOTION that the deposit of $500 made by the defendant be allowed as good and sufficient security for an. appeal asserted from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada affirming the judgment in favour of the plaintiff by the Superior Court, District of Montreal ([1]). The action was to recover one-half the amount of two endowment policies for $1,000 each, issued by the company on the life of Isadora Poirier, who was murdered, payable to him at the end of twenty years should he then be living, or to his wife should she survive him otherwise to his heirs. The plaintiff Poirier's mother, claimed as heir-at-law of one-half his estate, the wife, who was convicted and executed for the murder, having been deprived of her rights under the policies and in his estate. The company pleaded fraud ; asked that the policies should be set aside ; and also applied to have the other heirs of Poirier made parties to the suit in the Superior Court. The application to add parties was refused, and the company took an action in the Superior Court against all Poirier's heirs-at-law, including the respondent, to have the policies declared fraudulent and set aside. On the application of the company, the two cases were united for the purpose of trial only.\nThe plaintiff recovered the amount of her demand but the company's action for cancellation was dismissed. Both judgments were carried to the Court of Queen's Bench on appeal, where a further application for the consolidation of the two cases was refused and both appeals were, after hearing, dismissed. In the action to set aside the policies an appeal is pending in the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAn application to the Registrar of the Supreme Court, sitting as a judge in chambers, for approval of the security in the present case was refused, the registrar being of opinion that the amount involved in the action was under $2,000, and that the case did not fall within any of the exceptions mentioned in sec. 29 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act. In his decision the registrar followed Dominion Salvage Co. v. Brown ([2]) and other cases cited in Cassel's Supreme Court Practice (2 ed.), p. 40-46.\nFalconer for the motion cited Hunt v. Taplin ([3]) ; King v. Dupuis ([4]) ; Turcotte v. Dansereau ([5]).\nFitzpatrick Q.C. contra.\nThe Chief Justice : (Oral.) In actions where the demand does not bring the case within the appellate jurisdiction of this court it has frequently been decided, and it is the law and the practice of the court, that issues raised merely by the pleas cannot have the effect of increasing the amount in controversy so as to give the court jurisdiction although the questions raised by the pleas in defence to the action might affect amounts or controversies which, if originally demanded in the declaration or introduced by an incidental demand, would have been sufficient to warrant an appeal.\nThe motion to quash is granted with costs.\nTaschereau, Sedgewick and King JJ. concurred with His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nGirouard J: (Oral.) \u2014 I have not had time to examine the cases referred to by counsel and would not at present go to the same length as His Lordship the Chief Justice. Considering, however, that in this case all the beneficiaries have not been made parties to the action, I am clearly of opinion that there can be no appeal to this court.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Robertson.

J. and Taschereau, Sedgewick, King and Girouard JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA, APPEAL SIDE.\nSuretyship \u2014 Conditional warranty \u2014 Notice\u2014Possession of goods\u2014\u2014Art. 1959 C. C.\nT. wrote a letter agreeing to guarantee payment for goods consigned on del credere commission to R., on condition that he should be allowed, should occasion arise, to take over the goods consigned. Shortly afterwards the creditor, without giving any notice to T., closed the agency, withdrew some of the goods and permitted others to be seized in execution and removed beyond the reach of T. The creditor did not give T. any authority to take possession of the goods as stipulated in the letter of guarantee. In an action by the creditor to recover the amount of the guarantee:\nHeld, that the condition of the guarantee had not been complied with by the creditor and that he could not hold the warrantor responsible.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, appeal side, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, district of Montreal, which dismissed the action.\nThe plaintiff's claim was based on a letter of guarantee signed by the defendant, and sent to the plaintiff's firm, at Bradford, England, which was as follows :\u2014\nMONTREAL, December 29th, 1896.\nA S McLAURIN & Co.,\nDEAR SIRS,\u2014I hereby agree to continue the guarantee for \u00a3500 which you now hold against the indebtedness of W. E. Ross & Co for one year more, namely, until the 31st of December, 1897, on the condition that you allow me, should occasion arise, to take over the goods now held on consignment from you by W. E. Ross & Co., as a payment on your account for this guarantee, which also cancels all former guarantees.\nJOHN TORRANCE.\nThe guarantee which had been given previously read as follows:\u2014\nMontreal, December 31st, 1895.\nMessrs. A. S. McLaurin & Co.,\nDear Sirs,\u2014In consideration of your placing in my possession all the goods held on consignment from you by the firm of W. E. Ross & Co., of this city, I hereby guarantee to you payment of his account with you to the extent of five hundred pounds. This guarantee tobe null and void one year from this date.\nJOHN TORRANCE.\nThe plaintiff claimed $2,432.83, and alleged that his firm doing business under the name of \" A. S. McLaurin & Co.,\" in November, 1890, agreed with W. E. Ross, of Montreal, that Ross should sell goods for him as a del credere agent, and be responsible for all goods shipped by them to Montreal for customers whose names and orders for goods were given to the firm by Ross, and as security for payment of goods so shipped, and to he shipped Ross gave the firm from time to time a letter of guarantee by defendant, the last one being the letter of guarantee sued upon. Plaintiff closed the Ross agency summarily in January, 1897, without notice to Torrance withdrew all goods sent out which had been consigned to his own order and allowed those consigned to Ross to he seized in execution and removed from the warehouse, and about a year after wards he called upon the defendant to pay the amount of the guarantee.\nIn the trial court, Pagnuelo J., considering that the goods sold by plaintiff after June 1895 to Ross exceeded \u00a3500 sterling in value, rendered judgment in favour of the plaintiff for $2,433.33 with interest and costs.\nOn appeal to the Court' of Queen's Bench, the trial court judgment was set aside and plaintiff's action dismissed, (Blanchet J. dissenting), on the ground that the letter of guarantee was conditional in its terms, stipulating that in case of its being enforced by plain tiff he should give defendant possession of the goods consigned to his agent Ross at the date when the letter was given, and that the plaintiff did not comply with this condition but withdrew a part of the goods and allowed the remainder to be dispersed without notification or warning to the defendant, and that it had in consequence become impossible for the defendant to save the recourse stipulated for his own protection under the letter of guarantee.\nHutchison Q.C. for the appellant. No acceptance of the letter of guarantee was necessary, because the letters of guarantee, instead of being offers, were a compliance with a previous demand, and their delivery completed the contract between the creditor, who asked for the security, and the respondent who gave it, and must be presumed to have been given according to the terms of the demand made by the firm or previously agreed upon between the intended parties. The guarantee sued on is not for future liability but for an actually existing one, and covered the balance due at its date by Ross to appellant as well as at any time during the continuation of his agency.\nThe appellant was only bound to allow respondent to take possession should occasion arise, that is, if he chose to make the request, and as respondent was the only judge of the opportunity of making this demand, and neglected to do so, he cannot complain of want of notice, or pretend that appellant failed to fulfil an obligation which was not imposed upon him. Holt for the respondent. The conditional guarantee was not accepted, nor any act done to give notice of acceptance to the warrantor. Suretyship cannot be presumed; art. 1935 C. C.; Championni\u00e8re & Rigaud, t. 2, n. 1418; 4 Aubry & Rau, p. 630, \u00a7 426, 1o and p. 673, 1o; it is at an end when the surety can no longer be subrogated in the rights of the creditor, and here that has become impossible through the conduct of the plaintiff. There was no credit given upon faith of the security and no private of contract between the parties; Derouselle v. Baudet ([1]); nor was there any notice of the extent of the advances, or of the principal debtor's default; Holcombe Leading Cases, p. 176; Dorion v. Doutre ([2]); DeColyar's Law of Guarantees, p. 5; MclveT v. Richardson ([3]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE : (Oral.) We are all of the opinion that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench is perfectly correct for the reasons given by Chief Justice Sir Alexandre Lacoste and Mr.Justice Hall.\nI have carefully read the reasons given by Mr. Justice Blanchet for his dissent and I cannot agree with him. I concur with the learned Chief Justice in the court below in what he says about the condition of the guarantee. The evidence shows that the means the defendant required for his protection by his letter of guarantee were completely taken away by the plaintiff and the defendant was thus deprived of the benefit of the condition upon which he relied for indemnity in the event of his liability on the guarantee. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Hutchison & Ovghtred.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Morris & Holt.\n[1] 1 L. C.

S. C. c. 135, s. 24\u2014Art. 2267 C. C.\nA judgment affirming dismissal of a plea of prescription when other pleas remain on the record is not a final judgment from which' an appeal lies in the Supreme Court of Canada. Hamel v. Hamel (26 Can. S. C. R. 17), approved and followed.\nAn objection to the jurisdiction of the court should be taken at the earliest moment. If left until the case comes on for hearing and the appeal is quashed the respondent may be allowed costs of a motion only.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, appeal side, affirming a judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which maintained a demurrer and dismissed a plea of prescription filed as one of the defences to the action.\nOn the case coming on for hearing, the court of its own motion suggested that the judgment appealed from was not a final judgment, and that there was no jurisdiction in the court to hear such an appeal. Atwater Q.C. and Duclos for the appellant, urged that in so far as the issue raised upon the plea of prescription was concerned the judgment appealed from was final, and prohibited the defendant from availing himself of that defence which went to the root of the action. The following cases were cited in support of the view that the court had jurisdiction under the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, to entertain such an appeal, viz. : Chevalier v. Cuvillier ([1]); Shaw v. St. Louis ([2]); Shields v. Peak ([3]); Morris v. London & Canadian Loan Co. ([4]); Baptist v. Baptist ([5]); Powell v. Waters ([6]); Standard Discount Co. v. La Grange ([7]); Salaman v. Warner ([8]); Baptist v. Baptist ([9]); Eastern Townships Bank v. Swan ([10]), and art. 2267 C. C.\nRyan for the respondent was not called upon.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nThe Chief Justice: (Oral).\u2014The appeal must be quashed. There are decisions similar to the present in cases in the Privy Council and in this court governing the case. The recent case of Hamel v. Hamel (10) seems in point.\nAs regards costs, the respondent ought to have moved to quash instead of leaving the question of jurisdiction to be raised on the argument; the costs will therefore be only those of a motion to quash.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Atwater & Duclos.\nSolicitors for the respondent : McGibbon, Casgrain, Ryan & Mitchell.\n[1] 4 Can.

The action was for $12,188.00 and interest, and based on two promissory notes given in renewal of those mentioned in the evidence. The defendants were sued as executors under the will of the late Claude Melan\u00e7on, and pleaded that the notes were signed by them for the purpose of Obtaining a loan from the bank by discounting them, to pay the debts of Joseph Melan\u00e7on, who was a legatee under the will, by advancing his legacy to him; that the bank, before advancing the money, was informed of the purpose for which it was needed; that it was employed for that purpose, to the knowledge and under the control of the bank; that the bank knew the terms of the will and the powers which the defendants had under it; and that under the terms of the will the defendants had no power to sign notes for that purpose.\nThe executors named in the will were given directions as to the management, liquidation and division of the business and estate of the testator who was a merchant carrying on business in Montreal at the time of his death and, among other powers necessary for the purposes of the execution of the will the executors were given special powers by a clause therein, as follows:\nDe plus j'accorde \u00e0 mes dits ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires et adminis trateurs le droit de ne faire entrer dans l'inventaire qui sera fait des biens de ma succession que le r\u00e9sultat en bloc qui apparaitra me revenir d'apr\u00e8s l'inventaire commercial dans les biens et affaires de ma maison de commerce et dans toute maison de commerce ou association dans lesquelles je puisse \u00eatre int\u00e9ress\u00e9 sans requ\u00e9rir d'inventaire notaire pour constater tels dits biens, droits et actions, plus le droit de vendre, c\u00e9der ou transporter d'aspes l'usage commercial soit \u00e0 vente priv\u00e9e, en bloc ou autrement comme ils le jugeront \u00e0 propos et convenable et suivant et d'apr\u00e8s les termes et conditions et \u00e0 tels prix qu'il leur plaira tout mon fonds et roulant de commerce stock, de collecter mes cr\u00e9dits les Vend\u00e9e ou c\u00e9der a tant dans la piastre de compromettre et transiger avec les d\u00e9biteurs et en cas de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de r\u00e9gler, compromettre et transiger avec moi ou mes associ\u00e9s \u00e0 tant dans la piastre sur l'actif de ma dite succession et de ne faire entrer, tel que susdit, dans l'inventaire notari\u00e9 de mes dits biens que le r\u00e9sultat en bloc du produit de mon roulant stock, et de tous droits et int\u00e9r\u00eats que je poss\u00e8derai dans tout soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou association quelconque sans d\u00e9tail voulant que l'inventaire commercial remplace \u00e0 cet effet l'inventaire notari\u00e9, et je leur donne aussi le droit de transiger et compromettre avec les d\u00e9biteurs ou les cr\u00e9anciers sur tous les droits, r\u00e9clamations, dettes ou obligations g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques, ainsi que sur tons proc\u00e8s et litiges quelconques, de poursuivre en justice pendant leur saisine \u00e0 raison de tous droits mobiliers ou immobiliers, de m\u00eame que j'aurais Pu le faire moi-m\u00eame, de plus le droit d'em prunter et de donner toutes garanties sur mes biens, parts ou actions de banques ou autres compagnies ou institutions mon\u00e9taires et toute hypoth\u00e8que sur mes biens immeubles dans le cas o\u00f9 les affaires de ma succession le requerraient ainsi qu'ils croiront \u00e0 propos de le faire faire, signer et endosser tous biliets, suivant qu'il sera requis pour r\u00eagler et liquider les affaires do ma dite succession,\nOne of the subsequent clauses of the will was as follows:\nJe donne de plus \u00e0 mes dits ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires et adminis trateurs ou leurs rempla\u00e7ants tous les droits et pouvoirs n\u00e9cessaires de payer en aucun temps, \u00e0 aucun de mes dits enfants, soit gar\u00e7on ou fille, apr\u00e8s qu'il aura atteint l'\u00e2ge de trente ans, toute on aucune partie de sa part dans mes dits biens, aux fins de 1 aider, soit a s\u2019\u00e9tablir ou dans le cas qu'il en aurait besoin, le tout suivant la discr\u00e9tion, prudence et sagesse de mes dits ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires et adminis trateurs \u00e0 qui je m'en rapporte pour ce faire, les priant de faire en telles circonstances comme je ferais moi-m\u00eame aupr\u00e8s de tel ou tel de mes dits enfants si je vivais alors et voyais par moi-m\u00eame les circon stances dans lesquelles tel ou tel de mes dits enfants se trouvait alors place.\nThe trial court Pelletier J. dismissed the action with costs on the ground that the executors had no power to give notes for the purpose above mentioned and on an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench this judgment was affirmed, Hall and Ouimet JJ. dissenting.\nBrosseau for the appellant.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion for the respondents was not called upon.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by: THE CHIEF JUSTICE: (Oral.)\u2014The question is whether or not the two clauses of the will relied upon by the appellant can be construed together as giving power to the executors to raise the loan upon promissory notes as they have done for the purpose of advancing the share of one of the beneficiaries under the will. I consider that these two clauses are entirely separate and distinct and have no connection one with the other. The testator was a merchant and the pro vision in his will is evidently intended to assist the executors by giving them power to make promissory notes and endorsements of notes in connection with the winding up of his business for which purpose these powers were probably necessary and are not unusual, but this intention cannot be assumed to extend so far as to give that power to the executors to be used in the distribution of the estate among the beneficiaries or in order to raise money or loans for the purpose of advancing shares to any one of them. Further, it would be simply a wrong to permit money to be borrowed in such a manner for settlements ii advance with a legatee in a manner which would bind the other beneficiaries and make their shares charge able with the legacy advanced.\nI think the reasons for the judgment of the court below are clearly right and I am not at all impressed with the reasons given for the dissent from it.\nI should also mention that it is quite clear from the evidence of Mr. DeMartigny that the bank had notice of the nature of the powers of the executors under the terms of the will, for a copy of the will was deposited with the bank for its use and reference.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Brosseau, Lajoie & Lacoste.\nSolicitors for the respondents : Geoffrion, Geoffrion, Roy & Cusson.\n",

A County Court Judge was appointed arbitrator between the city and land owners, and by his award he allowed Leak over $8,000 for injury to his land, with interest from the date on which the by-law was passed. The city appealed to a judge in chambers who sent the award back to the arbitrator with a direction that it should state whether or not any land of Leak\u2019s had been taken, and if not that he was not entitled to interest. The arbitrator then amended his award by striking out the interest. The claimant appealed to the Chancellor who affirmed the amended award, and he then appealed to the Divisional Court which overruled the arbitrator\u2019s amendment and allowed interest. This judgment in its turn was reversed by the Court of Appeal and the Chancellor\u2019s judgment restored. The claimant then appealed to this court.\nDuVernet for the appellant. There is no statutory provision prohibiting the granting of interest in a case like this, and without it the appellant will not be fully compensated. See North Shore Railway Co. v. Pion[3]; Corporation of Parkdale v. West[4]; Bell v. Corporation of Quebec[5]; Lewis on Eminent Domain, sec. 499.\nFullerton Q.C. and Chisholm for the respondent, were not called upon.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE: (Oral).\u2014We need not call upon counsel for the respondents, as we are all of opinion that this claim for interest cannot be maintained. The question has been very ably and forcibly argued by the appellant\u2019s counsel, who has said everything which could possibly be said bearing on the point, but we think there is no ground whatever for the appeal. Interest is not given by any statute, and the whole analogy of the common law is against it. Nobody ever heard of a jury, in an action claiming damages for a tort, being told that after ascertaining the amount of the damages suffered they should calculate the interest thereon. Such a direction would be not only wrong but grossly wrong. The judges of the Court of Appeal have gone very fully into this question, and we agree with what they have said.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: DuVernet & Jones.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Thomas Caswell.\n[1] 26 Ont.

Lynn and the two appellants, and, upon the said firm ceasing to meet liabilities, the plain tiffs made a demand for a judicial abandonment for the benefit of creditors generally upon the members of the said firm. The appellants filed separate contestations of the demand denying that they were partners, and on the trial of the issues joined the Superior Court maintained both contestations and dismissed. the demand as unfounded in respect of the contestants. On appeals taken by the plaintiffs these judgments were reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench, and the demand for abandonment declared well founded inks much as it had been established by evidence that the contestants were partners in the firm.\nThe appellants then respectively filed judicial abandonments in each of which it was declared that exception was taken to the judgments rendered by the Court of Queen's Bench, in appeal, that an appeal there from to the Supreme Court of Canada was intended to be taken, recourse for which was reserved but that the abandonments were consented to under such reserves, \"in order to avoid a writ of copies,\" and other \" penalties trouble and costs.\" A curator was at once appointed to the abandonment who proceeded to the distribution of the estate according to law and subsequently, the appellants filed bonds for security for the appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAtwater Q.C. for the respondents, moved to quash both appeals on the grounds: 1st. That there was a want of jurisdiction under sec. 29, sub-secs. 1 and 4 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, because the demand was not of the amount of $2,000; and 2nd. That the appellants had voluntarily acquiesced in and S executed the judgments appealed from instead of applying for an extension of time under art. 859 C. P.Q.\nBelcourt Q.C. contra. The recourse for the appeal was specially reserved in each case, and in each the effect of the declaration of the existence of a partnership by the judgments appealed from will be to hold the appellants liable for many thousands of dollars of debt over and above the amount of $11,375.00 realised from the abandoned estate There never has been any acquiescement so far as this liability is concerned, and the consent to abandon was made under stress.\nThe Chief Justice: (Oral).\u2014Assuming that we have jurisdiction in this case (but without actually deciding that question), there cannot be any doubt that there has been acquiescement by the appellants in the judgments sought to be appealed from, for they have voluntarily made the abandonment and executed the orders made against them thus leaving the matter in a position where it is impossible they can get relief against their own deliberate and voluntary acts.\nThis is not exactly a case such as we have hitherto considered as a proper one for a motion to quash, but we are of opinion that in future this proceeding should be adopted in cases like the present, as it has the advantage of avoiding costs.\nThe court disposes of this appeal on the grounds alone that the appellants have acquiesced in the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench and abandoned their estate in conformity therewith and that there is now left nothing but a question of costs in respect of which the court always declines to entertain jurisdiction, though not incompetent to do so.\nThe appeal is quashed with costs of the motion to the respondent.\nTaschereau J.\u2014I agree with His Lordship the Chief Justice, and I think that in cases like the present where the appeal can only involve a question of costs the procedure of moving, when possible, to quash the appeal should in future be followed.\nGWYNNE. J.\u2014On the understanding that there is no res judicator in this case as to the question of partnership, I concur in this judgment.\nSedge wick J.\u2014.I am not quite sure that the abandonment was not made under stress and on account of what might be pressure. I enter a doubtful assent.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I agree with His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Carter & Goldstein.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Atwater & Duclos\n",

M. A. Noel deceased, and formally excluded the widow from the tutorship of her children, issue of her marriage with the deceased. On the report of the tutelle proceedings being presented for homologation, the Prothonotary of the Superior Court, District of Arthabasca, ignored the advice of the family council and assuming to act in conformity with the third subsection of article 282 of the Civil Code, named the widow as tutrix in place of the male relative recommended for the office by the family council. The appellant then petitioned the Superior Court for the cancellation of this nomination, and, after hearing the issues joined upon the contestation by the respondent, Choquette J. dismissed the petition with costs. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Review at Montreal, and the respondent dismissed from office, but on her appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, the judgment now appealed from was rendered reversing the judgment of the Court of Review and restoring that of the trial court in her favour.\nBisaillon Q.C. for the respondent moved to quash the appeal.\nFitzpatrick Q.C contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTaschereau J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench dismissing a petition of the appellant to set aside the appointment of the respondent as tutrix to her children. We have no jurisdiction in the matter. There is no pecuniary amount in dispute, and the matter in controversy does not\nrelate to' any feet Of office, duty, rent, revenue or any sum of money payable to Her Majesty, or to any title to lands or tenements, annual rents and other matters or things where future rights (of that nature) might be bound.\nAn affidavit is filed that the estate left by these children's father is worth over $2000. But that cannot give us jurisdiction. No part of the estate is in controversy in the case. The appellant, to support his right to appeal, relies upon the words of the statute, sec. 29 and (not \"or\") \u00f4ter matters or things where the rights in future might be bound.\nBut the case of O'Dell v. Gregory ([1]) is a binding authority that these words are not applicable to this case.\nIn the case of Mittchell v. Mitchell ([2]), relied upon by the appellant, upon an action to remove an executor this court entertained the appeal and the case might perhaps not be easily distinguished from this one. However, the court does not appear there to have passed upon the question of jurisdiction. The appeal being dismissed, it was unnecessary to determine that point as is often done in such a case.

The circumstances under which this appeal was taken are stated in the judgment of the court by His Lordship Mr. Justice Taschereau on the motion to quash.\nLajoie for the respondent referred to the question of jurisdiction raised in the respondent's factum and moyed to quash the appeal on the ground that the controversy did not relate to title to lands where rights in the future might be bound, the only question being the location of a servitude, not the right or title to it. The dispute as to that was settled in the first case; Macdonald v. Ferdais ([1]). That dispute is not of a matter where rights in future of the parties might be bound. That the judgment appealed from, although it decides finally that the new road cannot, in its present state, be substituted for the old road, does not deprive the appellant of his right, at any time in the future to offer another road, nor even of his right to offer the same road improved.\nLafleur Q.C. for the appellant cited Art. 557 C. C.; R. S. C. ch. 135, sec. 29 (b); Chamberland v Fortier ([2]) V; and McGoey v. Leamy ([3]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014An objection taken in the respondent's factum to the appellant's right of appeal has to be disposed of. In a former case between the parties, it was declared by the Superior Court's judgment, confirmed in this court on the first of May, 1893 ([4]), that the respondent had a certain right of way, therein described, over the appellant's land\nle tout n\u00e9anmoins sous 1ft condition que le d\u00e9fendeur (present appellant) ou tout autre propri\u00e9taire du fond servant pourra offrir et assigner un autre chemin de voiture ou passage pour l'exercice de la dite servitude, que le demandeur (present respondent) ou tout autre propri\u00e9taire du fonds dominant sera oblig\u00e9 d'accepter, pourvu qu'il ne soit pas plus incommode que celui que a exist\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 aujourd 'hui.\nThe respondent, in execution of that judgment issued a writ of possession ordering the sheriff to put him in possession of the road described in the said judgment. The appellant filed an opposition to that. writ of execution, alleging that he had duly offered and delivered to the respondent, present and accepting, a right of way upon his land (though not the one described in the judgment), in due compliance with and in execution of the judgment of the court, in virtue of the right to do so reserved to him in the said judgment. This opposition, upon contestation by respondent was maintained and the writ of possession set aside by the Superior Court. The Court of Appeal reversed that judgment and dismissed the opposition.\nThe controversy between the parties is consequently merely as to the localisation of the road in question. It is admitted, if that could possibly affect here the question of jurisdiction, that this road is not worth $2,000, and conceded on the part of the appellant, at the hearing, that the only ground upon which his Tight to appeal can at all be supported is that the controversy relates to a title to land and to a matter where the rights in future may be bound. But there is here no controversy of the title to the appellant's land or to any part of it; O'Dell y. Gregory ([5]); and the respondent's right of way over that land is not now in controversy. That controversy is at an end. It was settled in 1893 by the judgment of this court upon the action above referred to.\nThat case being an action confessoire was, as actions n\u00e9gatoires also are, appealable. Riou v. Riou ([6]); Chamberland v. Fortier ([7]); La commune de Berthier v. Denis ([8]).. But this is merely a contestation on the execution of that judgment. Rights in future may be bound by the judgment a quo, but they are not rights relating to a title to land.\nThe appellant would contend that as this is a contestation on the execution of a judgment which was appealable, and, in fact, appealed therefore the judgment upon this execution, or the contestation thereof is likewise appealable. But such a contention cannot prevail. It would be opening the door to a multiple city of appeals in the same case not intended by the statute.\nThe case of McGoey v. Leamy ([9]) has been relied upon to support the right to this appeal. But in that case the controversy between the parties exclusively and directly related to the title to a strip of land. Neither does the case of Chamberland v. Fortier ([10]) help the appellant. All that was determined in that case is that an action n\u00e9gatoire is appealable.\nThe case may not be free from doubt. As forcibly pointed out by Mr. Lafleur, the judgment a quo deter mines the precise spot where this right of way will be exercised on the appellant's land. However, the right to appeal is not clear, and the rule as to appeals is that the court cannot assume jurisdiction in a doubtful ease I refer to the cases cited on that point in Langevin v Les Commissaires d' \u00c9cole de St. Mare ([11]).\nThe appeal is quashed with costs of a motion.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Paradis & Pavadis.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Brosseau, Lajoie & Lacoste.\n[1] 22 Can.

H. failed to effect a sale.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from, that in an action by H. to recover expenses incurred in an endeavour to make a sale, and reasonable remuneration, parol evidence was admissible to show that the written instructions did not constitute the whole of the terms of the contract, but there had been a collateral oral agreement in respect to the expenses, and that the question as to whether or not there was an oral contract in addition to what appeared in the written instructions was a question that ought to have been submitted to the jury.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia en banc[1], which reversed the judgment at the trial and directed a new trial.\nAs the result of correspondence between the appellant and a member of the respondent's firm named Harris. the latter undertook to effect a sale, it possible, of a coal mine for the appellant, in consideration of a commission on the selling price of five per cent, which commission was to include all expenses. The attempts at sale proved abortive on account, as alleged, of interference by the appellant, and the respondents brought suit to recover remuneration for services rendered and reimbursement of expenses incurred, relying upon the correspondence which had taken place, and also upon an alleged verbal agreement for compensation for his services and outlay, contending that this verbal agreement was collateral to the main contract, inasmuch as the payment by commission was contingent upon a sale being made whereas the verbal agreement was to indemnify the agents in case of failure. The admission of evidence of such an arrangement was objected to as inconsistent with the contents of the writings which, it was contended, became a written agreement as soon as acted upon. At the trial a ruling was made against the admission of the evidence, and, the plaintiff having refused a non-suit, the jury, under the direction of the court, found a verdict for the defendant, and judgment was entered accordingly. The plaintiff moved against this judgment before the full court, and, on the ground that there was evidence upon which a jury might reasonably have found for the plaintiff, a new trial was ordered.\nAylesworth Q.C. for the appellant.\nS. H. Blake Q.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014After having heard the appellant's case very fully and ably argued, the court relieved the learned counsel for the respondents from answering it, for the reason that we were all of opinion that the appeal failed inasmuch as there was evidence which ought to have been left to the jury, and that therefore the order of the court below granting a new trial was not erroneous. In my opinion there was legal and admissible evidence in the deposition of the respondent Harris of a parol agreement supplemental to both the commissions to sell\u2014to that of the 18th of January, 1892, as well as that of the 18th of September, 1890\u2014making provision for a case which the written memoranda or letters signed by the appellant on the dates mentioned did not contemplate. Those letters only fixed the respondents' remuneration in the event of a sale being effected, in pursuance of the authority conferred upon Harris. Nothing is contained in them relating to the repayment for services and outlay for expenses in the event of a sale not being effected. It was not therefore in any way to vary or contradict the written evidence that there should have been a verbal agreement providing for indemnity to the respondents for the labour and disbursements of Harris in the event which has happened of failure to make a sale. The learned Chief Justice who presided at the trial seems to have considered that the terms of the letter from the respondent to the appellant of the 20th June, 1893, were so inconsistent with the existence of any claim of payment as a matter of right, that it neutralised the oral evidence given in the witness box and left nothing to be submitted to the jury. I cannot assent to this. The utmost that can be said is that the letter in question was a basis for contending before the jury, the proper tribunal, that they ought not to give credit to the testimony of the respondent Harris, but it was not a ground for withrawing the case altogether from the consideration of those who alone have the legal right to pass upon the credit of witnesses.\nThe appeal is brought before us without the amendment of the record ordered at the trial having been actually made. This ought to be done before the re-trial. There will then be presented by the plead- ings two alternative cases, that originally made and the additional case founded on the alleged verbal agreement to indemnify the respondent for his services and money expended.\nSpeaking only for myself, I am unable to agree that there was any evidence whatever of the original case made by the respondents that of undue interference with the respondents in their efforts to make a sale.\nThe order for a new trial in the court below proceeds upon this ground exclusively. Had there been nothing else in the case I should have thought the appeal ought to have succeeded ; as it is it must be dismissed and with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Davie, Pooley & Luxton.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Bodwell & Duff.\n[1] Sub.-nom.

Gwynne J. dissenting. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of Armour C.J., who had sustained the ruling of a referee ordered to settle the form of a lease to the Railway Company under the Vendor and Purchaser Act.\nThe material facts of the case were stated as follows in the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by Mr. Justice Maclennan.\n\u201cThe question in this appeal is whether, upon a reference to settle a lease pursuant to a contract between the parties, evidence is admissible to establish that the lease ought to contain a covenant on the part of the lessees, the Railway Company, to pay taxes. The learned referee decided that the evidence was admissible, and his ruling was affirmed by Armour C.J., on appeal.\u201d\n\u201cThere are two contracts between the parties, the first dated the 26th July, 1892, and the other the 4th February, 1895, and they deal with a great many different matters besides the lease in question. Among other things the Railway Company is to convey to the city absolutely all its interest in certain defined parcels of land, and the city is to demise to the Railway Company certain other lands, called the \u2018alternative site,\u2019 that is, a site in the City of Toronto \u2018for its station grounds, tracks and appurtenances.\u2019 The city\u2019s contract is in the following terms:\u2014The city \u2018covenants and agrees to demise and lease the alternative site to the Canadian Pacific for successive terms of fifty years each, during all time to come. The rental for the first term of fifty years shall be $11,000 per annum, and the rental for each subsequent terms of fifty years shall at each renewal be increased by $2,750 per annum, and all rent shall be payable on the 3rd days of July, October, January and April of each year, for the first quarter a proportionate amount to be paid, having regard to the time of possession under the said lease.\u201d\n\u201cThe second agreement, paragraph 2, provides that the first term of fifty years is to commence on the first day of January, 1895. Paragraph three defines more particularly what is to be included in the alternative site. Paragraph four provides for an adjustment of rents to the commencement of the lease. Paragraphs 11 and 13 provide for leases to the company by the city for successive terms of twenty-one years, in perpetuity, at the expiration of existing leases, of other parcels of land, at rents to be settled by arbitration; and paragraph 12 stipulates for the delivery of an abstract of title to the alternative site, and for its approval within a month after delivery. There seems to be nothing else in the agreements, material to the present question. There is a contract for a lease renewable in perpetuity in successive terms of fifty years, at an agreed rent, payable on named days; and the agreement is silent as to what, if any, covenants on the part of either lessors or lessees, are to be inserted therein.\u201d\nThe Railway Company appealed from this judgment to the Supreme Court.\nRobinson Q.C. and Fullerton Q.C. for the respondent moved to quash the appeal.\nThe appeal is not from a final judgment. After the case is decided by the Ontario courts on the merits there can be an appeal to this court in which the questions now raised will be open.\nMoreover, the matter is one of procedure only with which this court will not interfere.\nArmour Q.C. and Macmurchy for the appellant, contra.\nThe proceeding had in this case is identical with a suit for specific performance under the former law.

The respondents, who were engaged in the business of carrying goods through the territory, were required to pay a toll of 1\/2 cent per pound when using the appellants' tramway, and they brought an action for repayment of the sum so exacted, claiming the right to a free use of the road. Mr. Justice Dugas, before whom the action was tried, held that as the Department of the Interior, which has control over and management of Dominion lands, had not confirmed the franchise to the appellants, the latter had no right to exact tolls for the use of the lands in question. The appeal was from this decision.\nThis appeal was taken ex parte, the plaintiffs filing no factum, and not being represented by counsel at the hearing.\nAylesworth Q.C. and McGiverin appeared for the appellants.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSedgewick J.\u2014By an instrument dated November 3rd, 1898, the executive government of the Yukon Territory purported to grant to the appellants the privilege of constructing a toll tramway or waggon road, or partly both, from the towns of Dawson and Klondike to the mouth of Bonanza Creek and up to the head of Carmack's Fork, and purporting to fix a tariff of charges for the carriage of passengers and freight. In pursuance of this authority the appellants constructed, either in whole or in part, the tramway, at the expense of over $45,000, the road for the most part, if not altogether, going through Dominion lands.\nOn the 12th November, 1898, the respondents, who are publishers and proprietors of the Klondike Nugget, at Dawson, and carry on an express and carrying business as well, were engaged in carrying certain freight to Bonanza Creek, and found it necessary to use for that purpose the appellants' tramway, and were required to pay a charge or toll of 1\/2 a cent per pound on such freight, amounting to the sum of $1.25 on the whole. On the 18th November they brought this action for repayment of the amount alleged to have been exacted from them, claiming that they were lawfully using the roadway in question, and that the appellants had no right nor authority to levy the said toll or to make any charge against them for the carriage of freight along the trail, and in the alternative that, in any event, such charge or toll was excessive.\nThe case was tried before Mr. Justice Dugas, in January, 1899, and judgment was given in favour of the respondents, from which judgment this appeal is taken.\n\"We are of opinion that it should be allowed. The Yukon Territory Act ([1]) gives to the Commissioner in Council the same powers to make ordinances for the government of the territory as were at that time possessed by the Lieutenant Governor and Legislature of the North-west Territories, which powers are set out in c. 22 of 54 & 55 Vict. sec. 6, and are substantially the same as are given to provincial legislatures by sec. 92 of the British North America Act. It has never been doubted that the right of building highways, and of operating them, whether under the direct authority of the Government or by means of individuals, companies or municipalities, is wholly within the purview of the provincial legislatures, and it follows that whether they be free public highways or subject to a toll authorised by legislative enactment, they are none the less within the provincial power. In the present case the privilege granted the respondents was a matter purely territorial, and so the learned judge below seems to have held, but he gave judgment as he did because he was of opinion that in as much as the lands through which the roadway was built were Dominion lands, and the action of the Commissioner in Council had not been confirmed by the Department of the Interior, which department has under its control the management of Dominion lands, the appellants had no right of entry upon such lands, and that, therefore, the toll exacted was an illegal one. It seems to us that this view is an erroneous one. The question of the ownership of the soil is one with which the respondents have nothing whatever to do. Only the Crown, the owners of the roadway, could raise it, and the appellants being in possession and working their tramway in the same way as an ordinary railway company does, must be deemed to be rightfully in possession as against any one who can claim no title at all. The appeal should, therefore, be allowed with costs, and the action dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Tabor & Hulme.\n[1] 61 Vict c. 6 (D).\n",

The facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note and in the judgment of the court.\nGormully Q.C. and Orde for the appellant referred to the provisions of the British Columbia Statutes and argued that they made the certificate prim\u00e2 facie evidence of title and cast the burden of rebutting it on the plaintiff.\nJ. Travers Lewis for the respondent was not called upon.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by :\nGWYNNE J.\u2014 This case presents the most singular case of a claim to title to land alleged to have been acquired in virtue of a sale for alleged arrears of taxes which has ever, in my experience, come before the courts. The plaintiff resides in England and is the wife of one Robert Arthur Lawrence Kirk, who upon the 24th day of January, 1888, became seized in fee simple in possession of two town lots in the City of Vancouver, in the Province of British Columbia, one of which is situate on Hastings Street, and the other on Dupont Street, in the said city. His title to the former of the said lots was acquired by a deed executed by one John Callister whereby he granted and conveyed to the said Robert A. L. Kirk, his heirs and assigns,\nall that piece or parcel of land lying and being situate in the City of Vancouver, Province of British Columbia, and known and numbered as lot twenty-four, block eight, according to the subdivision of the west part of lot one hundred and ninety-six, group one, New Westminister District.\nThe title to the other of the said town lots the said Kirk acquired in virtue of a deed also executed upon the said 24th day of January, 1888, whereby one Southam A. Cash granted and conveyed to the said Kirk his heirs and assigns all that piece or parcel of land lying and being in the City of Vancouver, Province of British Columbia, and known and numbered as lot twenty, block thirteen, according to the subdivision of the west part of lot one hundred and ninety six, group one, New Westminster District.\nFrom the said 24th day of January, 1888, the said Robert A. L. Kirk remained seized in fee simple in possession of the said respective pieces of land so conveyed to him, until the 25th day of July, 1894, when by a deed executed by him he granted and conveyed unto the plaintiff, her heirs and assigns forever, the said respective pieces of land, and the plaintiff has ever since been and still is in possession of the said respective pieces of land by her agents and tenants holding under her. Both of these town lots have buildings erected thereon, and one is occupied by certain persons trading in the sale of wines and liquors under the name of Mynhart Brothers who have a stock in trade of the value of about three thousand dollars upon the premises, of which they are in occupation in virtue of a contract made with the plaintiff for the purchase thereof upon payment of a principal sum payable by annual instalments in lieu of rent. The other of the said lots is also occupied by persons doing business therein as proprietors of a Chinese store and restaurant. The plaintiff only learned in September, 1895, through her agents, that one E. J. Kirkland, assuming to act in the character of assessor of the District of New Westminster, had in the month of July, 1898, executed a deed whereby he purported to convey to the defendant in fee simple the said pieces of land so as aforesaid situate in the City of Vancouver, and thereupon, upon the 5th of October, 1888, she instituted the present action for the purpose of having the said deed produced and declared to be null and void, and in her statement of claim she alleged that since the commencement of her action the said deed had been registered and she claimed the right to have the said deed, or so much thereof as related to her said two town lots, set aside and declared to be null and void. The defendant in her statement of defence pleaded that\non the 15th day of July, 1896, the said lots were offered for sale by auction by E. L. Kirkland, assessor of the District of New Westminster, for arrears of taxes due thereon, with costs and expenses of sale, and that S. K. Twigge being the highest bidder became the purchaser thereof and had issued to him by said assessor under the provisions of said \" Assessment Act \" a certificate of such purchase. This certificate together with all the right, title and interest of S. K. Twigge in and to the said land was afterwards on or about the 18th day of July, 1898, for value received, assigned and transferred to the defendant. Taxes were due and in arrear upon the land so sold to S. K. Twigge and transferred to the defendant for a sufficient time to entitle the said assessor to sell the same, and all assessments, levies, notices (prior and subsequent) and advertisements required by the \"Assessment Act\" were made, given and published, and all other requirements of said Act necessary to the validity of said sale were fully complied with.\nAnd the defendant further admitted the execution of the deed of the 20th day of July, 1898, in the plaintiff's statement of claim mentioned, and pleaded that,\nthe said conveyance had been duly registered and a certificate of title issued to her in respect thereof under the provisions of the \" Land Registry Act.\"\nUpon the above matters pleaded by way of defence to the plaintiff's statement of claim the defendant claimed a right\nto have the plaintiff's action dismissed with costs and a declaration made that she (the defendant) is the owner in fee and entitled to the possession of the said lots.\nIssue having been joined upon the above defence the case was brought down for trial when the plaintiff proved that she was in possession of the said respective lots under and by virtue of the above several deeds executed as to one of the said lots by John Callister, and as to the other of the said lots by Southam A. Cash, both dated the 24th day of January, 1888, and the transfer deed above mentioned bearing date the 25th day of July, 1894, executed by Robert A. L. Kirk, the grantee in the said first mentioned deeds to the plaintiff in fee, and she also produced an instrument entituled \"certificate of title,\" dated the 28th day of August, 1894, signed \"J. O. Townley, District Register,\" certifying to the registration of a transfer deed or conveyance in fee of the said lots dated the 25th day of July, 1894, from Robert Arthur Lawrence Kirk to Evelyn Georgiana Kirk, his wife, in fee, and that the name of the said Evelyn Georgiana Kirk was entered in the absolute fee book as the owner in fee of the said lots.\nThe defendant by way of defence produced an instrument also entituled \" certificate of title,\" dated the 29th day of November, 1898, and signed \"J. O. Townley, District Registrar,\" certifying to the registration of a deed or conveyance in fee of the said two lots inter alia in pursuance of the provisions of the Assessment Act for taxes due to 31st December, 1896, from E. L. Kirkland, assessor of the District of New Westminster, to Mary M. Johnson, and that in virtue of such deeds of transfer the name of Mary M. Johnson was entered in the absolute fee book as the owner in fee of the said two town lots.\nThe defendant rested wholly upon this certificate and contended that it was prim\u00e2 facie evidence that the defendant was absolute owner in fee of the said two town lots, and that her said certificate being subsequent to that given to the plaintiff wholly displaced and neutralised the latter unless and until the plaintiff should prove the negative or non-existence of the conditions, the existence of which as pleaded in the defendant's statement of defence could alone give to the deed executed by Kirkland to the defendant whatever validity, if any, it had in law; notwithstanding her defence as above pleaded the defendant absolutely refused to produce the deed from Kirkland to her, and insisted upon resting her defence upon her certificate of title of the 29th November, 1898, issued as appears nearly two months after the commencement of this action. The plaintiff thereupon gave in evidence of that deed an examined copy of the deed in the registry office and we thus find the deed to be materially different from the title as pleaded by the defendant in her statement of defence.\nIt is in the words and figures following:\nTo all to whom these presents shall come. I, E. L. Kirkland, of the District of New Westminster, in the Province of British Columbia, send greeting: Whereas by virtue of the provisions of the \" Assessment Act\" the assessor of the said district did on the 15th day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and ninety-six, sell by public auction to Mary M. Johnson, of Skagway, in the District of Alaska, U. S. A., that certain parcel or tract of land or premises hereinafter mentioned at or for the price or sum of twenty dollars and eleven cents of lawful money of Canada on account of delinquent taxes and additions alleged to be due thereon up to the thirty first-day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-six, together with costs.\nNow know ye that I the said assessor as aforesaid, in pursuance of such sale and the \"Assessment Act\" and for the consideration aforesaid do hereby grant, bargain and sell unto the said Margaret M. Johnson, her heirs and assigns, all that certain parcel or tract of land and premises, containing\u2014being composed of lot twenty-four (24), block eight (8), and lot twenty (20), block thirteen (13), in the west eighty-five (85) acres of one hundred and ninety-six (196), group one (1) for taxes due to thirty-first December eighteen hundred and eighty-six (1886), also west half (1\/2), block thirteen (13), in the north-west quarter (1\/2), lot three hundred and thirty-six (336), group one, (1) for taxes due to thirty-first December eighteen hundred and eighty-six (1886), New Westminster District.\nThe instrument is then dated 20th July, 1898, and is signed with the name\nE. L. KIRKLAND,\nAssessor. The amount of taxes so alleged to have been due amounted in so far as the same was claimed to affect the said two town lots, the property of the plaintiff, was the small sum of twenty-two cents in respect of each of the said lots, which together were proved to be of the value of upwards of six thousand dollars, or say $3,000 each.\nThe learned trial judge rendered judgment for the plaintiff. His judgment has been confirmed by the Supreme Court of British Columbia. From the judgment of the latter court the present appeal is taken, and in the argument before us it was rested wholly upon the contention that the defendant's certificate of title of November, 1898, is prim\u00e2 facie evidence of the absolute title in fee being in the defendant in displacement of the plaintiff's title by deeds as relied upon by her, and of her certificate of title of August, 1894, unless and until, (as was contended at the trial), the plaintiff shall prove the non-existence of conditions, the existence of which could alone give to the deed from Kirkland to the defendant whatever validity, if any, it ever had.\nThe sole foundation upon which this contention is rested is contained in secs. 13, 19 and 23 of ch. III of the Revised Statutes of British Columbia which are but a transcript of secs. 13, 17 and 18 of ch. 67 of the Consolidated Acts of 1888. The Land Registry office, as the 3rd section of \" The Land Registry Act \" shews, was established \" for the record of instruments and the registration of titles,\" and it is apparent, I think, that the person placed in chief charge of the office under the title of \" Registrar General of Titles \" was intended to be a judicial officer, for in the discharge of the duties of his office he is required to exercise judicial functions. He is constituted both a judicial and a ministerial officer. Then by section 5 the like duties and powers, both judicial and ministerial, are imposed upon and vested in district registrars.\nSection 13 then purports to show how these respective functions are to be exercised. It enacts that:\nEvery person claiming to be the legal owner in fee simple of real estate may apply to the registrar for registration thereof in the form marked A in the first schedule hereunto annexed, and the registrar shall upon being satisfied after examination of the title deeds produced that a prim\u00e2 facie title has been established by the applicant register the title of such applicant in a book to be called \" the register of absolute fees \" in the form B, in the said first schedule, and shall also transcribe in another book to be called the absolute fees parcels book, a description of the lands to which the title relates.\nNow when a person claims the right to be registered in the absolute fee book as owner of the absolute fee in land, the title to which he claims in virtue of a deed in fee simple executed to him by a person already registered in the absolute fee book as the owner in fee, such a person may, under section 13, well be accepted by the registrar and be registered in the absolute fee book as prim\u00e2 facie owner of such land. It was, I think, in view of, and for the purpose of providing for such a case that section 13 was enacted. But where, as in the present case, the defendant was not claiming title in virtue of a deed executed by the plaintiff who was the last person appearing to have been registered in the absolute fee book as owner of the absolute fee (which term by the 2nd section of the Act is interpreted to mean the legal ownership of an estate in fee simple) it was impossible for the registrar, by mere examination of a deed which had no validity whatever in law unless the conditions precedent required by law to give it any validity had been fulfilled, to be judicially satisfied that the defendant had any right to be registered even as prim\u00e2 facie owner of the land mentioned in the deed from Kirkland to her. Kirkland appears in the transaction solely in the character of a person assuming to have a power vested in him, as assessor of the district of New Westminster, to realise by the sale of lot 24, block 8, the property of the plaintiff, the sum of twenty-two cents, alleged by Kirkland to have been in arrear and unpaid upon and ever since the 31st day of December, 1886, for a tax in respect of the said lot alleged to have been (but when is not stated), assessed upon and due by the then owner of the said lot, who now appears to have been one John Callister, and for securing payment of which sum with interest and costs the said Kirkland claims that a charge or lieu upon the said* lot became in 1886, and has ever since been until the alleged sale in 1896, vested in Her Majesty, and also to realise by sale of said lot 20, block 13, also the property of the plaintiff, payment of the like sum of twenty-two cents, also alleged by Kirkland to have been in arrear and unpaids upon and ever since the 31st day of December, 1886, for a tax in respect of the last mentioned lot alleged to have been (but when is not stated), assessed upon the then owner thereof who now appears to have been one Southam A. Cash, and for securing payment of which sum, interest and costs, the said Kirkland claims that a charge or lien upon the said last mentioned lot was vested in Her Majesty.\nNow the deed under which the defendant claims title contains nothing whatever to establish that there were such liens or charges upon the said respective lots of land vested in Her Majesty at the time of the alleged sale in 1896, or if there were, that Kirkland had any authority to realise such charges by sale of the lands.\nAt the time of the passing of the 43 Vict. ch. 36, on the 8th of May, 1880, sec. 66 of the Act of 1876, as amended by sec. 15, of the Assessment Amendment Act of 1878, was and continued to be in full force, and it enacted that:\nIf any of the taxes mentioned in the collector's roll in each year shall remain unpaid, and the collector be not able to collect the same he shall deliver to the officer in charge of the treasury an account of all the taxes remaining due on the roll and in such account the collector shall show opposite to each assessment the reason why he could not collect the same by inserting in each case the words \"non-resident\" or \" not sufficient property to destrain\" as the case may be.\nThen by sec. 14 of the Act of 1878 it was enacted that\nthe assessor or collector shall pay over monthly to the officer in charge of the treasury the monies from time to time received by him and shall forward to the officer in charge of the treasury on or before such day in the year 1878 as the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may appoint, and on or before the 30th day of November or such other day as may be appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council in each subsequent year, his roll together with a list of all arrears of taxes due, and in cases of taxes chargeable against land, with a description of the parcels, sections or lots and the amounts chargeable against the same.\nThen the Act of 1880 makes the person assessed not only personally liable for the taxes imposed both in respect of real and personal estate but also all his lands situate within the province and prescribes the proceedings to be taken in each year by the assessor or collector to levy the taxes.\nSec. 8 by distress of the goods and chattels of the person who ought to pay the same, or of any goods or chattels in his possession wherever the same may be found within the province, or of any goods and chattels found on the premises the property of, or in the possession of, any other occupant of the premises.\nAnd it is enacted in sec. 13 :\nIn default of sufficient distress or in case the collector shall deem it advisable to proceed for the recovery of the taxes due by levying the same in the first instance against the lands of the person owing such taxes he may levy the same together with all costs and charges including the costs of distress against goods and chattels, if any, by sale of so much of the lands of such person situate in his district as may be sufficient to pay the same.\nAnd by sec. 19 : In case the collector fails or omits to collect the taxes or any portion thereof the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may authorise the collector or some other person in his stead to continue the levy and collection of the unpaid taxes in the manner and with the powers provided by law for the general levy and collection of taxes, but no such authority shall alter or affect the duty of the collector to return his roll.\nUpon the return o the roll provision is made by the 21st section which enacts :\nIf any tax and additions remain unpaid after the return of the roll by the collector to the said officer in charge of the treasury, interest shall continue to attach thereon after the rate of twelve per cent per annum, and such tax, interest, and the cost of registration may on the application of the officer in charge of the treasury, be registered as a charge against the said land in respect of which such tax is payable, and the registrar general of titles is hereby required to register the same accordingly.\nThen sec. 23 prescribes the amount leviable as this land tax to be\none half of one per cent on the assessed value of real estate provided that the collector in lieu of the above rate shall receive one-third of one per cent on the assessed value of real estate if paid on or before the 30th day of June in each year.\nThen by sec. 40 of 42 Vict. ch. 36, A.D. 1878, as amended by the 22nd sec. of 43rd Vict. ch. 26, A.D. 1880, it was enacted that\non and after the 1st day of January, 1879, the provisions of \"the Assessment Act, 1876,\" as regards the tax on real estate shall not apply to, nor shall any taxes on real estate be assessed, levied or collected thereunder in any municipality.\nNow upon the 6th of April, 1886, the Act 49 Vict. ch. 32, to incorporate the City of Vancouver was passed, whereupon the above section of the Act of 1878 as amended by the Act of 1880 came into immediate operation, whereby the \"Assessment Act of 1876\" ceased to have any operation and which declared that no taxes should be collected or levied under it within the municipality, without any reservation whatever as to taxes if any there were due in virtue of any assessment made prior to the incorporation of the municipality ; but in point of fact there were not on the 6th of April, 1886, any taxes due in respect of assessments upon the lots in the City of Vancouver under consideration in the present case for by 42nd Vic. ch. 35, A.D. 1879, no taxes if any were assessed upon either of the lots in question in 1886 became delinquent until the 30th of June of that year. It is needless further to add that if any tax had been in arrear upon these lots respectively upon the 31st December, 1886, the collecting and levying of the same, if they could be collected and levied in despite of the 40th sec. of the Act of 1878 as amended by the 22nd sec. of the Act of 1880, could only be effected by order of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council after the return of the collector's roll of 1886 to the officer in charge of the treasury.\nBut it is useless to endeavour to enumerate all the objections to the validity of the sale attempted to have been made of the responden's property by a person not appearing to have had any authority whatever to interfere in the premises, but who has presumed to interfere not only in a matter in which he does not appear to have had any concern, but to have acted in direct defiance of the statute law governing the case. There is, however, one point which should be mentioned as absolutely fatal to the deed under which the applicant claims, if no other objection existed. One of the lots as already shown was professed to be liable to be sold for taxes alleged to have been due in December, 1886, by one John Callister, the then owner of the lot, and the other was professed to be liable to be sold for taxes alleged to have been due in December, 1886, by one Southam A. Cash, the then owner of this lot; but we must take it from the deed, of which proof was made as aforesaid, that the two lots and a third lot of whom somebody else was the owner in fee and which was in like manner alleged to be liable to be sold for taxes, but for what amount is not named, alleged to have been also due in December, 1886, by some person, (but who is not known) the then owner of, and assessed for this lot. Now the union of these three lots in one block and the sale of them as one, as appears by the deed executed by Mr. Kirkland to have been professed to be done for the sum of twenty dollars and eleven cents, was not authorised by any law and such a sale and the deed given thereon would be absolutely null and void even if no other objection to it existed. In fine the whole proceeding in the present case presents so many features of the utter absence of bona fides as to remove all prim\u00e2 facie evidence of title which the certificate given by the registrar afforded if it afforded any. The evidence which has appeared in the case is abundantly sufficient (by reference to the statutes bearing upon the subject) to call for a judgment pronouncing the deed under which the appellant claims and the registration thereof in the absolute fee book and the certificate of such registration to be absolutely null and void, and we are of opinion that to the judgment of the court below of the 11th of May, 1896, should be added a direction that the entries in the said registrar's department in relation to the said pretended sale and conveyance of the said lots to the appellant be expunged from the records in the said registrar's department. With this variation made in the judgment of the court below the appeal is dismissed with costs.\nIt is to be regretted that 'Mr. Kirkland is not before us in this appeal that he might be made responsible to the respondent for the costs of her action instituted to maintain her rights so wantonly and vexatiously interfered with by the defendant Kirkland in a matter in which he does not appear to have had any concern and wholly unauthorised in law.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Russell & Russell.\nSolicitor for the respondent: S.

The facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nRiddell Q.C. for the appellant.\nAylesworth Q.C. and Smith for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The appellants are lumber dealers doing business at Windsor, in the County of Essex, and the respondents are lumber dealers doing business in Detroit, Michigan. Early in May, 1897, the appellants sold, and the respondents purchased, a certain quantity of pine lumber at various prices according to the grade, and delivery at Windsor within a specified time. The contract was wholly by correspondence. The letter of the appellants of the 3rd May, 1897, completed the bargain between the parties, and contained the following clause:\nThe inspection of this lumber to be made after the same is landed here (Windsor), by a competent inspector to be agreed upon between buyer and seller, and his inspection to be final;\nand the only question in this case is as to whether the inspection thus provided for was in fact made by a person agreed upon between the parties. The action was tried before Mr. Justice Ferguson without a jury, and judgment was rendered for the appellants. Upon appeal to the Divisional Court the judgment was set aside and a new trial granted, which judgment was confirmed by the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Maclennan dissenting. The case now comes to this court in appeal from that decision.\nA majority of the judges of the appellate courts below seem to have considered that the inspector referred to in the letter, a part of which I have just set out, should have been agreed upon before he began to inspect at all. If they are correct in that view the appeal must be dismissed. We are of opinion, however, that is not the correct view, and the question is whether or not both parties, at any time before the inspection was completed, agreed upon Jubinville, who actually did inspect the lumber, and gave a certificate to that effect to the buyers. The learned trial judge, who heard the witnesses, found as a matter of fact that he was agreed upon by the parties as an inspector, while the lumber was being landed at Windsor.\nIt is not necessary to review the evidence, but in my view it fully justifies the finding of the learned trial judge. Mr. Justice Maclennan, in his dissenting judgment, has discussed the evidence and in a way which meets with my entire concurrence, and with him I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and that the judgment of the trial judge should be restored, the appellants having their costs in all the courts below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Clarke, Cowan, Bartlet & Bartlet.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Fleming, Wigle & Rodd.\n",

Shortly before a train had arrived from the west which had to be turned for a trip back in the same direction, and also to pick up a passenger car on a siding. After some switching the train was made up, and just before coming to the level crossing the engine and tender were uncoupled from the cars to proceed to the round house. B. saw the engine pass but apparently failed to perceive the cars, and started to cross, when he was struck by the latter and killed. There was no warning of the approach of the cars which struck him. In an action by his widow under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act the jury found that the railway company was guilty of negligence, and that a man should have been on the crossing when making the switch to warn the public. A verdict for the plaintiff was sustained by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Gwynne J. dissenting, that it was properly left to the jury to determine whether or not, under the special circumstances, it was necessary for the company to take greater precautions than it did and to be much more careful than in ordinary cases where these conditions did not exist; and that the case did not raise the question of the jury\u2019s right to determine whether or not a railway company could be compelled to place watchmen upon level highway crossings to warn persons about to cross the line.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff. The facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the above head-note, and more fully in the judgment of the majority of the court delivered by Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nRiddell Q.C. and Coburn for the appellant. The company cannot be compelled to place watchmen on the highway to warn the public; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Notre-Dame de Bonsecours[1]; Madden v.

Great Western Railway Co.[5]; Slattery v. Dublin, Wicklow & Wexford Railway Co.[6]; Blake v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[7]; Hollinger v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[8]\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The respondent is the widow and administratrix of David Barclay, late of Ridgetown, Ontario, and the appellants are a railway company operating a railway between Ridgetown and Walkerville. On the 9th of September,1898, Barclay was driving towards his home in Ridgetown, between nine and ten o\u2019clock in the evening. In order to reach his home he had to cross the appellant company\u2019s railway tracks by means of a level crossing on Victoria Avenue. As he was in the act of driving along the street his carriage collided with a moving passenger car and he was killed. His widow brought an action against the company under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act and recovered a verdict for $3,000, $2,000 of which was allotted to herself, and $500 to each of her minor children\nThe questions submitted to the jury and the answers thereto will indicate the nature of the issue in the present case:\n(1). Were the defendants guilty of any negligence which caused the accident? Yes.\n(2). If they were, in what did such negligence consist? We agree that a man should have been on the crossing when making that switch to warn the public.\n(3). Could the deceased have avoided the accident by the exercise of reasonable care? No.\n(4). If the plaintiff is entitled to damages, at what sum do you assess them? Divide the amount at which you assess them between the widow and children in such proportion as you think proper.\nTo the widow..........................................................................\n$2,000 00\nTo the boy Lawson, 9 years old............................................\n500 00\nTo the girl Jeannette, 7 years old.........................................\n500 00\nTotal damages assessed.....................................................\n$3,000 00\nJudgment was entered upon these findings, and an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed by a unanimous judgment, from which judgment an appeal is taken to this court.\nRidgetown is the eastern terminus of the railway and Victoria Avenue was east of the station. The evening train had arrived at Ridgetown a few minutes before the accident, and was composed of an engine and tender, a baggage and a passenger car. It was necessary to turn the train for the western trip, and also to pick up a passenger car which was standing upon the siding. After some switching the train was arranged with the engine and tender at the east, in the front, followed by the two passenger coaches and the baggage car. In this order it proceeded eastward on the main line to cross Victoria Avenue, as the engine and tender had to go to the round house and the cars to the main line north of the round house; the train was started, then the coupling between the tender and the cars being disconnected the engine proceeded at an increased speed, and the cars followed at the original speed, one brakesman going with the engine that he might turn the round house points to the main line for the cars after the engine had gone down the round-house switch, another brakesman remaining on the train in front, or east end of the front passenger car. The deceased, I gather from the evidence, must have seen, or at all events heard, the engine and train approaching before the cars were separated from the engine, but he did not in all probability see or notice the fact of such separation, and after the engine had passed the crossing, he was noticed driving his horse and carriage slowly across the track without noticing the cars coming on behind, and having no notice of the approaching cars, and it being impossible in the short time to stop the cars, the fatal accident occurred. There was some evidence to show that owing to piles of lumber on the company\u2019s lands at the point in question, his vision of the train was necessarily obstructed, and there was also evidence to show that the train was not sufficiently manned. There was, as the jury have found, no watchman at the crossing. The jury found that the appellants\u2019 negligence consisted in their failure to have a man on the crossing at the moment of the accident. The learned counsel for the appellants endeavoured at the argument to make it appear that the only question raised in this case was as to whether it is to be left to a jury to determine if a railway company can be compelled to place a watchman upon level highway crossings to warn persons about to cross the line and rail. I do not consider that any such broad ques- tion is raised here at all. The respondent\u2019s counsel do not make any such contention. It was, I think, properly left to the jury to determine whether or not in this particular case where, late on a dark night, at the terminus of a railway, shunting was being carried on, and that of an excessively dangerous character (the process being that of a running or flying switch), at a place in a town thickly populated, and over a much frequented avenue or highway, there being no engine connected with the train colliding with the carriage, and none of the usual signals such as the blowing of whistles or the ringing of bells to give warning to passers by, it was not necessary, at that particular time and under those particular circumstances, to take greater precautions than they really did take, and to be much more careful than in ordinary cases where these conditions did not exist. There was, in my view, a clear case to submit to the jury, and I entirely concur in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal in delivering the judgment of that court.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J. (dissenting.)\u2014The respondent brought an action as administratrix of her deceased husband, one David Barclay, against the appellants for damages occasioned by the death of her said husband who was killed by a train of carriages of the defendants upon a main line of the defendants, as it crosses Victoria Avenue in the town of Ridgetown, by reason as is alleged of the negligence of the defendants\u2019 servants in charge of the said train. The acts of negligence relied upon in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim as negligence which caused the death of the deceased are as follows: 1st. That the defendants negligently and carelessly allowed cars and obstructions to stand near to the crossing so as to obstruct the view of persons using the said highway and passing the said crossing.\n2nd. That they carelessly and negligently left the said crossing without fence or gates and without watchmen or signals.\n3rd. That they negligently used the said highway and crossing as a place for switching and shunting, handling and driving cars in a dangerous manner; and\n4th. That as the said David Barclay was approaching the defendants\u2019 said track, a steam engine of the defendants under the charge and control of defendants\u2019 servants was driven very rapidly and with a great deal of noise and commotion along the main track across said Victoria Avenue immediately in front of him and in such a manner as to attract his attention thereto, and when the said engine had crossed Victoria Avenue, and while the said David Barclay was crossing the main track of the defendants, in rear of the said engine, and before he could get clear of the said track, a number of coaches of the defendants under the charge and control of defendants\u2019 servants were negligently, suddenly, at a rapid and dangerous speed driven across the said Victoria Avenue,\nand the statement of claim concludes by alleging that by reason of such negligence the said David Barclay was struck by the buffer or platform of the forward car and was instantly killed. Issue having been joined upon a plea of not guilty the case was brought down to trial before a jury.\nUpon the main question essentially necessary to have been established, namely, whether the defendants were chargeable with any negligence to which the collision which caused the death of the deceased could fairly and reasonably be attributed, there was no contradiction whatever in the evidence which was as follows:\nAt about 9.30 o\u2019clock on the night of the 9th of September, 1898, a passenger train of the defendants arrived from the west at Ridgetown station and shortly afterwards proceeded eastwardly along the main line across Victoria Avenue to take the engine to an engine or round house which was situated at the distance of between 700 and 800 feet east of Victoria Avenue, and to leave three cars which were being hauled by the engine upon the main track to a point north and east of a switch situated east of Victoria Avenue, and which led down southeasterly from the main line to the engine house [Illegible text] as to place these three cars in proper order for the being taken on the passenger train going west on the following morning. The station house from which these carriages and engine proceeded is situated at a distance of over 600 feet west of Victoria Avenue. When the engine with the carriages had proceeded to a point distant about the length of three cars from the western limit of Victoria Avenue the engine was separated from the carriages and proceeded ahead at a somewhat increased speed so as to reach the switch leading down to the engine house in time to enable the engine to pass down and to have the switch placed so as to let the coaches following pass on to their destination on the main line. The evidence showed the length of the company\u2019s passenger coaches to be 57 feet, so that the point where the engine became separated from the coaches was, according to the only evidence upon the subject, situate just about 171 feet from the west limit of Victoria Avenue, and according to the like evidence the engine proceeded from thence, fully lighted as required by law, and ringing its bells and going at a speed not exceeding six miles an hour, while the carriages followed with the speed previously given at a rate of about four miles an hour. The evidence further showed that Victoria Avenue was 100 feet in width. Thus this evidence, which as I have said was the only evidence upon the subject, establishes as a fact that when the engine had reached the centre of Victoria Avenue, or the distance of 221 feet from the place where it had dropped the carriages, the carriages had proceeded the distance of nearly 150 feet and the front carriage had reached a point about 21 feet west of the avenue, and upon the same calculation, before the engine had completely crossed the avenue the front carriage had entered upon and traversed about eight feet of the avenue. Then the uncontradicted evidence also established that this front car and also the third were fully lighted throughout and that a man stood on the front of the first car as it proceeded east, with a lighted lamp, standing on the platform in front of the open door of the car throwing light all round, while he himself leaned over the front of the car on the lookout as they approached the crossing, and when about a car length or 57 feet from the crossing he by the light proceeding from the cars saw a horse and rig coming up in the darkness, for the night was dark, from the south, on the avenue towards the railway; and then he hallooed to the person in the rig whom he did not see, to look out, in a voice quite loud so that he could have been heard by the person in the rig if he was paying any attention. In expectation that the person in charge of the rig would stop his horse upon being so warned the cars proceeded. The horse however was not stopped, but proceeded walking up towards the railway and was not even stopped when it reached the south track of a siding which was situate about twelve feet south of the main track; upon reaching this siding the horse and rig were quite close to the carriages running on the main line, but proceeded across the siding and entered upon the main line directly in front of the carriages when the collision immediately occurred and the man in the rig was instantly killed. At what distance from the railway the horse and rig were when the man on the front carriage gave the alarm and hallooed to the occupant of the rig to look out did not appear, but it is obvious he was near enough to have heard the alarm as the only evidence upon the point states it to have been given, and it is absolutely inconceivable that he could have failed to see the approaching carriage which was fully lighted, and the light from which had enabled the man who gave the alarm upon the front carriage to see the horse coming up in the darkness; but when the horse and rig reached the siding south of the main line the south rail of which was about 12 feet south of the main line nothing short of the maddest recklessness of the man driving the horse and rig can account for his not having then stopped and so have prevented the happening of the collision, unless indeed he was asleep or otherwise incapable of taking care of himself, for the evidence shows him to have been in perfect health and having no defect either in his hearing or his eye-sight. Almost all the time occupied in the trial was naturally taken up in an attempt made on behalf of the plaintiff to explain this apparently very negligent and careless conduct of the deceased by an effort to establish that his apparent apathy was attributable to his not having seen the approaching carriages by reason of a car and other things standing, as was alleged, on the railway premises between the deceased in his rig and the approaching carriages; but assuming there to be any thing in the contention all its force, if any, became irrelevant for it was wholly vested upon the assumption of the deceased, (in order that he should have been so prevented from seeing the lighted, coaches) being at points on the avenue further south than the point where he was when the man in the first carriage saw the horse coming up in the darkness and gave the alarm as stated by him. From that point until the collision took place there was nothing whatever inter- vening which could have prevented the deceased seeing the lighted coaches if he had been using his faculties as it was his duty to do. The declaration admits that the engine was driven across the avenue \u201cwith a great deal of noise and commotion,\u201d and in a manner sufficient to have attracted the attention of the deceased, and there was not a particle of evidence reasonably to explain the apathetic conduct of the deceased. That this was the opinion entertained by the learned trial judge appears from his charge to the jury upon this branch of the case wherein, after referring to the evidence of the man on the first carriage as to his having seen the horse coming up and to his having shouted an alarm in the manner testified by him, the learned judge proceeded as follows:\nNow you know how quickly a horse can be stopped that is going two miles an hour\u2014that is walking at a slow walk. Why did not that man stop his horse? Was there anything on earth to prevent him if he had been looking out? Just think of that. You are bound by your oaths to determine this case by the evidence. Now, can you find any reason on earth why that man should not have stopped his horse ten feet away from the track before the train came along. If he might have done it, then you should answer the question that is put to you \u201cthat he could by reasonable care have avoided the accident.\u201d If you can find any reason in the world in order to account for his not having stopped it, consistently with the exercise of reasonable care under the circumstances, then of course you will consider it, but I myself cannot suggest to you any reason now for his not stopping, when you take (into consideration) his duty which is a duty to look out when he comes to a railway crossing.\nNow, the learned judge having entertained this opinion, I must say that I think he should not have submitted any question to the jury as to the deceased having been or not having been guilty of contributory negligence but should have told the jury that upon the evidence the only conclusion that reasonable men could arrive at was that the deceased by his own carelessness, indifference or recklessness had either wholly caused or had at least contributed to the causing of the collision which resulted in his death, in either of which cases the defendants were entitled to judgment in their favour. In the recent case of The Halifax Electric Railway Co. v. Inglis[9] I have cited several of the numerous cases which bear upon this point. The learned judge however submitted the following questions to the jury, namely:\n1st. Were the defendants guilty of any, and if any, what negligence which caused the accident?\n2nd. Could the deceased have avoided the accident by the exercise of reasonable care?\nThese questions the jury answered by saying that they found the defendants guilty of negligence in not having a watchman at the crossing to warn the public, and they answered the question as to contributory negligence of the deceased in the negative.\nThe answer of the jury to the first of these questions absolves the defendants from all charge of negligence which caused the collision, unless the not having had a watchman at the crossing constituted such negligence. Now there is no legislative provision requiring the defendants to have a watchman at the crossing. Parliament has, by the statute 51 Vict. ch. 29 sec. 187, vested in the Railway Committee of the Privy Council the power and duty to determine whether or not and when it shall be necessary for a railway company to maintain in the interest of the public safety a watchman where the railway crosses a public highway, and to make an order to that effect if they shall deem it to be expedient. Such order when made has statutory obligation. No such order has been deemed to be necessary or been made by the Committee of the Privy Council in relation to the crossing under consideration in the present case, and the defendants are under no obligation to maintain a watchman at such crossing unless the obligation is imposed by the common law. All that the common law requires is that the defendants should give such warning of approaching trains as should be reasonably sufficient to attract the attention of travellers on the highway so as to enable them to make use of their faculties to avoid all danger, and in view of the warning given, as appears in the uncontradicted evidence, both by the voice of the person standing for that purpose in front of the first carriage, and by the light proceeding from the lighted up carriages which was abundantly sufficient to attract the notice of the deceased, if he had been, as he ought to have been, paying attention, which warning appears to have been wholly disregarded by him, no jury acting as reasonable men who duly appreciated the nature of their duty as jurors can be justified in finding that the collision was caused by there not having been a watchman at the crossing, whose warning, if one had been there, might have been equally disregarded, as was the warning which was given. The fact of there not having been a watchman at the crossing cannot, notwithstanding the finding of the jury, be accepted in law under the circumstances as constituting negligence which caused the collision.\nThen as to the answer of the jury to the question relating to contributory negligence of the deceased it can only be attributed to sympathy with the plaintiff in her no doubt grievous loss, for there is not in the evidence anything to support it. The judgment in appeal appears to me to sanction the introduction of a new principle in the determination of actions of the nature of the present one, namely, that however sufficient to attract the attention of travellers upon a highway crossed by a railway upon the level the warning given by the railway company may be, and however recklessly and carelessly the traveller may disregard such warning, nevertheless if a collision should take place and the traveller should suffer, and if a jury should be of opinion that some other mode of warning might by possibility have been more effectual in arousing the traveller to the proper exercise of his faculties, it would be quite competent for the jury to pronounce the not giving of such possibly effective warning to be negligence in the company which caused the injury, and to acquit the injured person of having by negligence on his part contributed to the happening of his injury.\nThe appeal should in my opinion be allowed, and the action dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.H.

Millar for the appellant.\nNesbitt Q.C. for the respondents. The judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This appeal is from a judgment which relates only to the interests of defendant Campbell who formerly was a partner of the defendant Taggart, they having been in business together in partnership under the name of \u201cFrank S. Taggart and Company.\u201d The appeal must be dismissed with costs, and upon the grounds upon which the courts of Ontario have proceeded. There cannot be entertained a doubt that the proper construction to be put upon the subject matter involved in this appeal is that all the acts and undertakings of Mr. Moore, who was secretary treasurer and had sole management of all the affairs of the company with the exception of the manufacturing business which is under the management of the president, were the acts and undertakings of the plaintiff company. Upon Taggart and Company executing the assignment for the benefit of their creditors, Taggart went to the State of Ohio to see the plaintiff company who next to a firm of Buntin, Reid and Company (who had security by chattel mortgage upon the stock in trade of the insolvent firm) were the principal creditors of the latter. The insolvent firm had also several other creditors whose united claims amounted to a little over $30,000. Taggart\u2019s object in seeing the plaintiffs was to endeavour to get them to come to his assistance in getting him out of his difficulties, and to set him up again in business on his own account altogether apart from the defendant Campbell. He had on that occasion an interview with the president of the company and the secretary treasurer, Mr. Moore, and gave them to understand that if the plaintiff company would pay 25 cents on the dollar to the creditors, other than Buntin, Reid, and Company, and the plaintiffs themselves, he could get a discharge from all the other creditors, and that then his estate which he represented to be worth more than $40,000 would be amply sufficient to pay Buntin, Reid & Co., and the plaintiffs. He so far prevailed with the plaintiffs that Mr. Moore was sent to Toronto to investigate the matter with full authority to make any arrangement be should think fit upon behalf of the plaintiffs. The president of the company says that it was left to Moore to carry out the transaction and to do what he liked in the matter. Whatever Moore did, he said, \u201cwas us, was for us.\u201d\nMoore came to Toronto and saw the assignee in the insolvency, and adopted the valuation which the assignee had made of the insolvent estate and agreed to advance the sum of 25 cents on the dollar of the claims of the unsecured creditors, and did advance the sum necessary for that purpose, and thereupon the said creditors executed a deed of discharge of the said insolvent firm dated the 27th day of April, 1893.\nThe next step was the preparation of a deed in such form that it could be executed by Mr. Clarkson, the assignee of the insolvent firm, and for that purpose a deed was prepared and executed by the said assignee bearing date the 11th day of May, 1893, whereby in consideration of the sum of $8,637 therein alleged to be paid by Moore to the said assignee, the latter conveyed to Moore, his executors, administrators and assigns, all the estate and effects, real and personal, and all the right, title, interest, property, claim, demand, rights and credits of every nature whatsoever of the insolvent firm subject to the claims of the plaintiff company and of the Hampden Watch Company, and of Messrs. Buntin, Reid and Company.\nThe above sum of $8,637 was the 25 cents in the dollar advanced by the plaintiff company through Moore to pay the other creditors of the insolvent firm and a sum to cover costs of the proceedings taken on the consignment for the benefit of creditors, and the Hampden Watch Company was either a part of the plaintiff company or under its control\nThe deed contained a covenant executed by Moore, that he would duly settle with the said plaintiff company and with the Hampden Watch Company for their claims against the estate of the said firm of Taggart and Company, and would indemnify and save harmless the said assignee from all said claims.\nNow this deed, in which Moore is named to be the grantee, was in substance a deed conveying the estate of the insolvent firm to the plaintiff company, and that this is so plainly appears by an instrument bearing date the same day and expressed to be made between the plaintiff company of the first part, Buntin, Reid and Company of the second part, Moore of the third part, and Taggart of the fourth part, whereby it was declared that Moore should become the purchaser of the said estate of the said insolvent firm, and should hold the same upon trust to sell and to apply the proceeds after deducting necessary expenses, as follows: 1st. To pay Buntin, Reid & Co. the amount secured by the chattel mortgage with interest and costs. 2nd. To pay the said sum of $8,637 and interest and costs 3rd. To pay the plaintiff company the amount of their debt with interest at the rate of 7 per cent; and 4th. Upon trust to assign and set over unto Frank Stark Taggart aforesaid, his executors, administrators or assigns, or to whom he or they should appoint, all the rest, residue and remainder of the said estate and effects together with the right of successorship in the said business, and all the assets of the said business then subsisting. The agreement then provided that Moore might at his discretion buy such other stock as he might think fit, and that the cost of the purchase money of such goods, and the expenses attending the sale thereof should be added to the amount of $8,637 paid to Clarkson, and the proceeds arising from the sale thereof applied first in paying for the same and subject thereto in the same manner as the proceeds of the goods conveyed by Clarkson. Then the agreement contained a clause as follows:\nAnd the said Frank Stark Taggart having himself the sole and absolute right to the use of the firm name of \u201cFrank S. Taggart & Co.,\u201d hereby consents and agrees that the said business shall be carried on as aforesaid by the said Moore in the name of \u201cFrank S. Taggart & Co.\u201d\nThe business was then carried on by Moore on behalf of the plaintiffs, or I should rather say by the plaintiffs through the intervention of Moore, who placed Taggart and one Williams acting in the interest of Buntin, Reid & Co., in possession of the stock in trade conveyed by Clarkson, and of such other goods as the plaintiff through Moore supplied, and who sold them by retail under the name of \u201cFrank S. Taggart & Co.,\u201d as provided in the above recited agreement. Moore from time to time received the accounts of and proceeds of sales until the month of October, 1893, when Buntin, Reid & Co. having been paid the amount of their claim upon the 7th day of October, executed a release of such their claim, and thereupon Moore on behalf of the plaintiff, or rather the plaintiff through the intervention of Moore, transferred what remained of the estate and effects which had been conveyed to Moore as aforesaid by Clarkson, the value of which was then estimated at $30,000, to Taggart for the sum of $25,000 secured by Taggart\u2019s promissory notes and a chattel mortgage executed by him on the stock in trade, and thus as it appears to me was affected the arrangement as prepared by Taggart in his own private interest, to the utter exclusion of the defendant Campbell, when Taggart in April sought the assistance of the plaintiffs. There cannot, I think, be entertained a doubt that all the subsequent proceedings as above related were entered into and carried out for the purpose of setting Taggart up in business again, and that the plaintiffs are the parties who entered into the arrangements with Taggart in the name of Moore, who acted simply as the representative of the plaintiffs; and that the transactions as above narrated had the effect of absolutely discharging the defendant Campbell from all liability to the plaintiffs in respect of the debt of the old firm of which he was a member, cannot I think admit of a doubt.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Millar, Ferguson & Hughes.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Mills & Tennant.\n[1] 26 Ont.

S., telegraphed to C, a grain merchant in Toronto, \"Quote bottom prices 20 to 25 cars, thousand bushels each, white oats delivered, basis Truro freight, bagged in our bags even four bushels each\" C. replied next day, \"White oats 32 half, Truro, bags two cents bushel extra.\" S. wired same day, \"How much less can you do mixed oats for? Might work white at thirty-two, but not any more. Answer.\" C. answered, \"Mixed oats scarce but odd cars obtainable half cent less. Exporters bidding 23 for white. Highest freight, Truro freight two half over Halifax. Offer white 32 bulk, 34 half in four bushel bags, Truro.\" Next day S. wired, \"I confirm purchase 20,000 bushels oats, white, at thirty-two; mixed at thirty-one half, bagged even four bushels in my bags. Confirm May yet order five cars more in bulk,\" and he confirmed it also by letter. C. answered telegram at once, \"Cannot confirm bagged. Am asked half cent for bagging. Bags extra.\" S. replied, \"All right: Book order. Will have to pay for bagging.\" C. wired same day, \"Too late to-day. Made too many sales already. Will try confirm to-morrow.\" On receipt of this S. wrote urging action, and next day wired, \"Will you confirm oats? Completed sale receipt first telegram yesterday. Expect you to ship.\" C. answered next day, \"Market advanced two cents here since yesterday noon. Had oats under offer expecting your order until noon yesterday. When you accepted bagged parties demanded half cent for bagging. They sold before your second wire yesterday. This is why I could not confirm. Think advance too sudden to last.\" He wrote to S. to the same effect that day. The oats were never delivered and S. brought an action for damages.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, that there was no completed contract between the parties, as they did not come to an understanding in respect to some of the material terms, and S. could not recover. Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated above and in the judgment of the court.\nW. J. O'Connor for the appellant.\nBorden Q.C for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The appellant is a grain merchant carrying on business in Toronto, Ontario, and the respondent is also a grain merchant carrying on business in Truro, N.S., and the question in controversy is as to whether or not there was a completed bargain between them as to a quantity of oats. The negotiations commenced on December 6th, 1897, by the following telegram from the respondent to the appellant.\nF. F. Cole, Toronto, Ont.\nQuote bottom prices twenty to twenty-five cars, thousand bushels each, white oats, delivered, basis Truro freight, bagged in our bags, even four bushels each.\nWalter. C. Sumner.\nThe next day the following reply was sent: White oats, 32\u00bd, Truro, bags two cents bushel extra. F. F. Cole. On the same day the respondent telegraphed:\nF. F. Cole, Toronto, Ont.\nHow much less can you do mixed oats for. Might work white at thirty-two, but not any more. Answer.\nWalter C. Sumner.\nThe same day the appellant telegraphed back: Mixed oats scarce, but odd cars obtainable half cent less. Exporters bidding 23 for white. Highest freight, Truro freight two half over Halifax. Offer white 32 bulk, 34\u00bd in 4 bushel bags, Truro.\nThe respondent next day telegraphed the appellant:\nF. F. Cole, Toronto, Ont.\nI confirm purchase twenty thousand bushels oats, white at thirty-two, mixed at thirty-one half, bagged even four bushels in my bags. Confirm. May yet order five cars more in bulk.\nWalter S. Sumner. And on the same day the respondent confirmed by letter his proposal as just stated, adding:\nIf it is at all possible, would like to have 12,000 bushels of this order mixed oats. If cannot get that many, get what you can, but do not ship them to any other than the destinations we give you for mixed oats.\nOn receipt of respondent's telegram, the appellant telegraphed him:\nW. C. Sumner, Truro.\nCannot confirm bagged. Am asked half cent for bagging. Bags extra.\nAnd received in reply the following telegram: '\nF. F. Cole, Toronto, Ont.\nAll right. Book order. Will have to pay for bagging.\nWalter C. Sumner.\nOn the same day the following reply was sent:\nW. C. Sumner, Truro.\nToo late to-day. Made too many sales already. Will try confirm to-morrow.\nOn the receipt of this last telegram, the respondent wrote the appellant confirming previous telegrams and adding:\nYour message just to band saying, \"too late to-day. Made too many sales already. Will try confirm to-morrow.\" Want you to try hard to do this for we confirmed to our customers. After waiting over four hours for your answer concluded you had accepted.\nOn December 9th the respondent telegraphed appellant:\nWill you confirm oats? Completed sale receipt first telegram yesterday. Expect you to ship.\nOn December 10th the appellant telegraphed:\nMarket advanced two cents here since yesterday noon. Had oats under offer expecting your order until noon yesterday. When you accepted bagged parties demanded half cent for bagging. They sold before your second wire arrived yesterday. This is why I could not confirm. Think, advance too sudden to last.\nOn the same day in addition, the appellant wrote the respondent:\nThe lot of oats which I had under offer for you were sold for export the same day you wired accepting them in bags. And he added:\nIn regard to mixed oats, I do not know at this writing where I could get even one car load. When a car is offered it can be bought for half cent bushel less than white oats. If your wire which I received here at noon on the 8th had accepted 20,000 bushels of oats at 32 cents, you would have got them but you did not accept. You accepted white oats at 32 cents, mixed 31\u00bd bagged even four bushel bags, and you asked me to confirm. You will note that I did not confirm. Later that day, you subsequently confirmed, but it was too late for me to secure them, and I so advised you.\nThere was further correspondence which so far as I can see does not materially affect the case. The oats not having been delivered, an action was brought for damages. The case was tried before Mr. Justice Townshend, who awarded damages to the amount of $543.84. Upon appeal, his judgment was confirmed, Mr. Justice Meagher dissenting.\nI am of opinion that this correspondence does not contain a complete contract. The rule of law is that:\nAn acceptance of a proposition must be a simple and direct affirmative in order to constitute a contract, and if the party to whom the offer or proposition is made accepts it on any condition, or with any change of its terms or provisions which is not altogether immaterial, it is no contract until the party making the offer consents to the modification; that there can be no contract which the law will enforce until the parties to it have agreed upon the same thing in the same sense. Carter v. Bingham[1].\nNow it appears to me that the parties have never come to a common understanding upon more than one material term in respect to each of which there may be a difference of opinion, a difference which, from the correspondence, it is simply impossible to adjust. For instance, both the appellant and the respondent want to supply the bags. The bags cost the appellant 6\u00bd cents, while he is asking for them 8 cents. The telegram of December 8th, \"all right book order; will have to pay for bagging\" which the respondent contends was the final acceptance and completion of the contract, while it makes it clear that the \"bagging,\" that is the cost of placing the grain in bags, was provided for, there was no determination as to who was to provide the bags, or as to how much was to be paid for them if the respondent did provide them.\nAgain, there had been offers and replies as to mixed oats; no definite agreement has been come to as to those; and still again, there would be difficulty as to the quantity to be delivered; the appellant never assented to 20,000 bushels, but to twenty to twenty-five cars, thousand bushels each.\nThe court below appeared to think that a letter of the appellant written in January, 1897, ten months before, might be looked at in order to construe the alleged contract. In that letter the appellant made the respondent a standing offer as follows:\nI will bag oats for you at any time free of expense, you furnishing the bags.\nThis contract, however, if a contract at all, shows that the terms of that letter must not have been in contemplation by the parties, or at all events, that the contract was made irrespective of the letter, because it expressly provides that the respondent should pay for bagging.\nOn the whole, I am of opinion that no completed contract existed between the parties. The appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed, the whole with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Alex. McNeil.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H. A.

In 1897 the appellant telegraphed the respondent as follows:\u2014\"Windsor Electric Station completely burned. Fully insured. Send us quotations for new plant. Will look after your interest.\" The reply was:\u2014\"Can furnish Windsor 180 Killowatt Stanley two phase, complete exciter and switchboard, $4,900, including commission for you. Transformers, large sizes, 75 cents per light.\" * * * The manager of appellant company went to Windsor but could not effect a sale of this machinery. Shortly after a travelling agent of the Independent Company came to Halifax and saw the manager and they worked together for a time trying to make a sale but the agent finally sold a smaller plant to the Windsor Company for $ 1,800. The Starr Company claimed a commission on this sale and on its being refused brought an action therefor.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Gwynne J. dissenting, that the Starr Company was not employed to effect the sale actually made; that the Montreal Company offered the commission only on the sale of the specific plant mentioned in the answer to the request for quotations; and that there was no evidence of any course of dealing between the two companies which would entitle the Starr Company to such commission. Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick on this appeal.\nCahan for the appellant.\nBelcourt Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014In October, 1897, a fire occurred at Windsor, N.S., and the Windsor Electric Light Station was destroyed. On October 18th the appellant company, who carry on the business of dealers in electrical supplies, sent the following telegram to the respondent corporation, who are manufacturers of, and dealers in, electrical machinery in Montreal:\nWindsor Electric Station completely burned. Fully insured. Send us quotations for new plant. Will look after your interest.\n(Signed) JOHN STARR, SON & CO.\nTo this the respondent company replied by telegraph as follows:\nMontreal, October 18th, 1897.\nMessrs. John Starr, Son & Co.,\nHalifax, N.S.\nAnswering telegram. Can furnish Windsor one hundred and eighty Killowatt Stanley two phase, complete exciter and switchboard, forty-nine hundred dollars, including commission for you. Transformers, large sizes, seventy-five cents per light. Can make immediate shipment of generators and transformers. They can use generators for transmission scheme later.\n(Signed,) THE ROYAL ELECTRIC CO.\nThis, in my view, was a specific offer by the Royal Company of one large machine of 4,000 lights and upwards, for the sum of $4,900, including a commission for the Starr Company, and it was the only authority the Starr Company had from the Royal Company in connection with furnishing new machinery for the Windsor Electric Light Station. Mr. Starr went to Windsor to endeavour to make a sale of this machinery, but signally failed. Afterwards, Mr. Ross, a travelling agent of the respondents, sold to the Winds or Company another, and different machine, of a much smaller make, for $1,800, and under specific instructions as to price from the head office. This action was brought to recover $180 as commission upon the price of the machine thus sold.\nMuch stress was laid upon an alleged course of dealing which, previous to the correspondence above mentioned, had taken place by correspondence between the two companies, and it was sought to make this alleged course of dealing a part of the contract in respect of which commission was claimed. But although the trial judge found there was a course of dealing as alleged the evidence completely failed to establish it, and the court upon appeal so determined.\nThe Starr Company further contended that they were entitled to a commission in consequence of a contract which their travelling agent had made with them prior to the actual sale. But there was no evidence whatever given to prove any authority on the part of the travelling agent to make any bargain whatever with the Starr Company. That also the court below found. The judgment of the court below was therefore right. The right of the appellant company to a commission depended solely upon whether they had sold the specific machine described in the telegram of October 18th. They did not sell that machine, or anything in character like it, and therefore their right to commission failed.\nI need not discuss more fully the evidence, which has been fully dealt with in the judgment of Mr. Justice Townshend, a judgment in which I entirely concur. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J. (dissenting.)\u2014The judgments of the learned trial judge and of Mr. Justice Graham in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in affirmation thereof are, in my opinion, free from objection. The defendants are manufacturers at Montreal of electric plant designated by the term \"Stanley Apparatus.\" The plaintiffs are a company doing business at Halifax as agents or intermediate dealers in electric plant between the manufacturers and purchasers of such plant. In a letter dated the 8th May, 1895, the plaintiff\u2019s as such intermediate dealers applied to the defendants and asked for particulars and specifications of their \"Stanley apparatus\" electric plant, and tendered their services in effecting sales thereof for the defendants. In reply to this letter the defendants on the 13th of May, 1895, wrote a letter to the plaintiffs in which they express themselves ready to accept offers for their Stanley plant at prices named for several classes then manufactured by them at the respective prices in the letter attached to each class, and they assure the plaintiffs that in working for orders for them they should have the protection of the defendants upon the terms therein stated which were that the defendants should be informed of the parties with whom the plaintiffs should be in treaty and should be kept advised of the progress of the plaintiffs' negotiations. No direct traactions between the defendants and purchasers with whom the plaintiffs were in treaty took place, but many transactions took place of sales effected for defendants of their plant to divers parties by and through the plaintiffs, who out of the purchase monies passing from the purchasers, through their hands, to the defendants, the plaintiffs were authorized by the defendants to retain and did retain the sum of ten per centum on the amount of purchase money agreed upon by the defendants as remuneration to the plaintiffs for their services as intermediate dealers.\nIn October, 1897, the whole of the plant of a company doing business at Windsor, Nova Scotia, under the name of the Windsor Electric Co. was utterly destroyed by fire. In a telegram of the 18th October, 1897, the plaintiff communicate from Haliiax this fact to the defendants at Montreal, and say \"Send us quotations for new plant; will look after your interest.\"\nThe defendants reply by telegram on same day and furnish particulars of an improved plant of a higher class and cost than any of those already mentioned in defendants' letter to plaintiffs of 13th May, 1895.\nThereupon the plaintiffs immediately proceed to Windsor and enter into negotiations with the Windsor Electric Company for the defendants to supply all the electric plant they should require, and urged them to put up the defendants' \"Stanley apparatus,\" and particularly urged them to take that specified in the defendants' telegram of the 18th October. On the 20th of October, 1897, they communicated to defendants what they had done in the matter in their interest. Shortly afterwards the defendants sent their own foreman, one Ross, to Halifax to see the plaintiffs and to assist them in their negotiation with the Windsor Electric Company. Ross informed the plaintiffs of the purpose of his arrival being to assist the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs took him to the Windsor Electric Company to whom (being informed by the president of that company, that they did not wish to pay a price which should include commission to any one) Ross, in the plaintiffs' absence, stated that the plaintiffs had no authority to act as agents on behalf of the defendants and notwithstanding his assurance to the plaintiffs that he came to assist them in their negotiation, and that whatever he did would be in the interest of the plaintiffs, upon the faith of which assurance the plaintiff, John Starr, returned to Halifax, and in his absence Ross proceeded to carry on the negotiation initiated by the plaintiffs which terminated in the defendants closing the negotiation with the Windsor Electric Company for the sale to them not of plant of the class mentioned in the telegram of the 18th of October but of one of the smaller classes of the defendants' manufacture, and at the sum of eighteen hundred dollars. It is for commission upon this sale that the action is brought, and the defendants not disputing the reasonableness of the amount if they are liable, repudiate all liability. The learned trial judge has found the facts to be as above stated, and that it was not competent for the defendants so to interfere with the negotiations initiated by the plaintiffs, and he estimated the amount of the remuneration to which they are entitled at 10 per cent upon the amount of purchase money proceeding upon the basis of all the transactions which had taken place between the defendants and the plaintiffs since the letter of 13th May, 1895. In this judgment I can see nothing which can be objected to. There is no foundation I think for the contention that the plaintiffs' powers of negotiation and their right to be remunerated was limited to the sale of the particular plant mentioned in the telegram of October That plant being placed in the hands of the plaintiffs appears, to me to have been simply an addition to the plant named in the letter of the 13th May, 1895, and all were placed in the same position as to the plaintiffs negotiating for sales. No amount of commission was specified in respect of the plant named in the telegram of October, 1897, or in respect of that named in the letter of May, 1895, and the evidence being clear that the plaintiffs entered upon negotiations with the Windsor Electric Company upon behalf of the defendants, and with their authority had no right whatever to interfere in any manner to prevent the negotiations initiated by the plaintiffs being brought to a close by them without adequately remunerating the plaintiffs for their services, and as there is no dispute as to the amount of the remuneration to the plaintiffs if the defendants are liable for any amount, i am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Harris, Henry & Cahan.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Drysdale & McInnes.\n",

(1887) c. 193\u2014Construction of statute\u2014Arrears of taxes\u2014Distress.\nThe provisions of section 135 of the Ontario Assessment Act (R.S.O. (1887) ch. 193) in respect to taxes on the roll being uncollectable, providing for what the account of the collector in regard to the same shall shew on delivery of the roll to the treasurer, and requiring the collector to furnish the clerk of the municipality with a copy of the account, are imperative.\nTaxes on the roll not collected cannot be recovered by distress in a subsequent year unless such arrears have accrued while the land in respect of which they were imposed was unoccupied.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (26 Ont. App. R. 459) affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court (30 O.R. 16) affirmed. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of a Divisional Court[2] in favour of the plaintiff.\nIn 1891 the plaintiff was on the collector\u2019s roll for the taxes for that year in respect to lot 65 Huntley street, Toronto, and his sister for the adjoining lot 63. In January, 1892, plaintiff paid the collector $75, and at the trial there was a dispute about its appropriation, the collector swearing that he was instructed to pay off all the taxes on lot 63 and apply the balance towards payment of the sum due on the plaintiff\u2019s own lot. These instructions were denied by the plaintiff.\nIn 1895 a sum for arrears of taxes on lot 65 was placed on the collector\u2019s roll, though such arrears had never been demanded from the plaintiff. The roll for 1891 delivered to the treasurer in the following year did not show opposite the respective assessments remaining unpaid, the reason the same were not collected, nor was the city clerk furnished with a copy of the account as required by section 143 of the Assessment Act.\nIn 1896 the plaintiff\u2019s goods were distrained upon for the arrears and the action in this case was for damages caused by such alleged illegal distress. At the trial the action was dismissed, but the Divisional Court reversed the judgment of dismissal and gave judgment for the plaintiff with $100 damages, which the Court of Appeal affirmed. The city then appealed to this court.\nFullerton Q.C. and Chisholm for the appellant. The plaintiff had means of relief under the statute which should have been exhausted before he could bring an action. Cooley on Taxation, 2 ed. p. 283. Blackwell on Tax Titles, secs. 471 and 475. Stewart v. Taggart[3]. Failure of the collector to distrain in the first instance does not take away the remedy by Supreme Court of Canadadistress in the future. McDonell v. Mc\nDonald[4]; Allan v. Fisher[5].\nJ.W. McCullough for the respondent. The provisions of the Act as to the duties of officers of the municipality are imperative, and the city must show that they were strictly complied with. O\u2019Brien v. Cogswell[6]. And see Whelan v. Ryan[7]; Love v. Webster[8].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The respondent brought an action against the appellants alleging in his statement of claim that they had in 1896 caused a distress to be made upon his goods situate upon premises owned and occupied by him in the ward of St. Thomas, in the City of Toronto, for taxes assessed upon him in respect of the same premises in the year 1891 and which the respondent in his statement of claim alleged had been paid by him to the collector, having had the roll of that year for the collection of the taxes therein mentioned.\nThe premises in question consisted of a lot numbered 65 on the east side of Huntley street, in the City of Toronto, with a dwelling house thereon in which the respondent lived. He produced a receipt dated January 16th, 1892, signed by John Kidd, the collector of the taxes assessed in St. Thomas Ward, for the year 1891, as follows:\nReceived from F.A. Caston, on account of taxes on Huntley street, seventy-five dollars.\nAn extract from the collector\u2019s roll of the year 1891 was produced whereby it appeared that the respondent was assessed in that year as occupant and owner of said lot No. 65 in the sum of $48.24 taxes which the collector was authorised and directed to levy. And that immediately preceding this entry on the roll Mary L. Caston appeared to be assessed as occupant, and Richard T. Coady and Charlotte Coady as owners of lot 63 on the east side of said Huntley street, and adjoining said lot No. 65 in the sum of $46.31\u00be.\nIt appeared that the roll when returned by the collector to the treasurer did not comply with the provisions of section 135 R.S.O. 1887, but in lieu thereof there was an entry in pencil made in the column headed \u201cdate of demand of taxes\u201d as follows: \u201cJan. 16, \u201c \u201892, paid on account $75.\u201d This entry was placed opposite to both of lots Nos. 63 and 65, and no sum was appropriated to either lot. The respondent swore that the payment was made in respect of the taxes charged on the roll upon his lot No. 65, and not at all in respect of taxes charged on the lot No. 63. He also said that he never had any notice that the City of Toronto claimed that any arrears were due upon his said lot until the year 1895, when a sum of $69.27 arrears appeared in the collector\u2019s bill of taxes demanded of him in 1895, and served upon him. He said that upon receipt of this bill he made repeated efforts to have this corrected, but failed, and then he proved the distress complained of which was made in June, 1896, to collect said sum of $69.27 which with additional interest and charges then amounted to $73.43. On the defence the collector of the ward for the year 1891, who prior to that year and thenceforth until and in the year 1896 had been and still was collector of the ward, was called, and he testified that when the respondent paid the $75 mentioned in the receipt of 16th January, 1892 he gave express directions that the money should be applied first in payment of the taxes charged on lot 63, and the balance on his own lot 65. He said also that the respondent had paid the taxes on the lot 63 every year since 1885. In fine upon a lengthy examination and cross-examination of the collector, and upon a further examination and cross-examination of the respondent in reply, and upon an examination and cross-examination of Mr. Coady, who in 1891 was, and in 1897 still was treasurer of the city, was assessed as owner of lot 63, of which Mary L. Caston was assessed as occupant, in 1891. The learned trial judge came to the conclusion arrived at, as plainly appears by his judgment upon the estimate made by him of the weight and credibility of the evidence, that the respondent had instructed the collector to apply the $75 paid in January, 1892, in the manner the collector had stated, and he gave judgment dismissing the action with costs. From this judgment the respondent appealed to the Divisional Court of Queen\u2019s Bench. That court called for some further evidence to admit of proof of some by-laws and some other points, and while it declined to interfere in any respect with the judgment of the learned trial judge upon the question of fact so as aforesaid determined by him, namely that the taxes charged in respect of lot 65, in 1891, were not paid in full as was contended by the plaintiff in the action, still the court was of opinion that the distress made in 1896 for arrears of taxes in 1891 was unauthorised in law and could not be supported, and they therefore reversed the judgment of the learned trial judge and gave judgment for the plaintiff in the action with $100 damages.\nUpon an appeal from that judgment by the above appellants to the Court of Appeal in Toronto, that court affirmed the judgment of the Divisional Court of Queen\u2019s Bench and dismissed the appeal. The appellants now appeal from that judgment to this court. It has been held by both courts, and in this, I think, we must concur, whatever the result may be, that the duties prescribed in sec. 135 of ch. 193 R.S.O. 1887, are enacted as the basis and foundation of all subsequent proceedings which are authorised to be taken for the recovery of taxes not paid while the roll remains in the collector\u2019s hands unreturned; and that therefore the requirements prescribed in the section are imperative. That section enacts that:\nIf any of the taxes mentioned in the collector\u2019s roll remain unpaid and the collector is not able to collect the same, he shall deliver to the treasurer of his municipality an account of all the taxes remaining due on the roll, and in said account the collector shall show opposite to each assessment the reason why he could not collect the same by inserting in each case the words, non resident or not sufficient property to distrain, or instructed by council not to collect as the case may be, and such collector shall at the same time furnish the clerk of the municipality with a duplicate of such account, and the clerk shall upon receiving such account mail a notice to each person appearing on the roll with respect to whose land any taxes appear to be in arrear for that year.\nIt appeared in evidence that a return was made to the treasurer by the collector of his roll of 1891 professedly with intent to fulfil the obligations of sec. 135. Yet by an extract from the returned roll which, as affecting the lots 63 and 65 on Huntley street, was produced at the trial, it appeared that no entry was made showing what sum, if any, was paid in respect of the said lots respectively, nor of either of them, nor why the respective amounts directed by the roll to be levied in respect of the said lots were not levied, as, if not levied, was required by the section. All that was entered on the returned roll as appeared by the said extract as affecting these lots, was the entry already mentioned set opposite to both of them, \u201cJan 16, \u201992, paid on account $75.\u201d No duplicate return whatever as was required by the section was furnished by the collector to the clerk of the municipality. It appeared also in evidence that in levying the tax by distress the collector could not have had and had not any difficulty, for that the respondent resided upon the lot and had abundance of chattels on the lot for which he was assessed as occupant and owner by distress upon which the taxes due could have been collected.\nThe effect as it appears to me of this default of the collector in obedience to the requirements of the section was, not merely that notice was not, as indeed it could not have been given by the clerk to the respondent as required by the section (the importance of which notice being given to the respondent in the circumstances of the present case is referred to by Mr. Justice Moss, in the Court of Appeal), but the main effect of the collector\u2019s default appears to me to be that the treasurer could not from the collector\u2019s return on his roll say how much of the $75 appearing on the roll to have been paid in respect of both lots, should be applied to each, and could not therefore from the collector\u2019s return say to which of the lots the sum which the $75 were insufficient to pay could be charged as arrears still due. The return therefore which the treasurer appears to have furnished to the clerk in 1894 containing a list of all the lands in his municipality in respect of which any taxes have been in arrears for three years wherein the sum of $69.27 as set down as due by the respondent for arrears of taxes assessed upon him in the year 1891, as occupant and owner of the said lot 65, could not have been made out from entries made on the collector\u2019s returned roll of 1891, as required by section 135, but apparently from oral information given by the collector to the treasurer.\nIn the Court of Appeal for Ontario, Burton C.J. gives a reason for affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court not expressed in the judgment of that court which proceeds upon the ground that the default of the collector of 1891 in fulfilling the requirements of section 135 fatally effects all future proceedings to enforce payment of arrears, if any there be, of 1891 from the respondent, and confines the remedy of the appellants to a claim against the collector for the injury suffered by his default. In the opinion of the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal the law does not authorise any arrears of taxes of a previous year to be recovered by distress in a subsequent year except in the one case provided for in section 143 of the Act which, as the learned Chief Justice says in his judgment, is only where the \u201carrears\u201d have accrued while the land in respect of which they have accrued was unoccupied.\nIf the learned Chief Justice\u2019s construction of section 143 is correct it is admitted as beyond dispute that the levy by distress upon respondent\u2019s property in 1896 was illegal and cannot be justified.\nNow apart from all consideration of any question whether the return of the respondent\u2019s name on the list furnished by the treasurer to the clerk in 1894 can be used for any purpose affecting the respondent in view of the default as already referred to, of the collector to fulfil the requirements of section 135, let us for the present purpose look upon that return as quite valid. Section 141 requires the clerk to keep the list so furnished to him by the treasurer, and to give a copy of it to the assessor of the next year who is required to ascertain if the lots in such lists are occupied or incorrectly described, and if occupied to notify the occupants and also the owners, if known, whether resident in the municipality or not \u201cthat the lands are liable to be sold for arrears of taxes.\u201d Then the assessor is required to return the list to the clerk together with his assessment roll of the year and also a memorandum of any error discovered in the list. All this enactment points to the taking of a step preliminary to a sale of the land for the arrears of taxes.\nNow the clerk of the municipality who has charge of all the assessment rolls as returned in each year upon which are entered the names of all occupants of the lands therein assessed and who from these rolls makes out the collector\u2019s rolls in each year upon which are entered the names of all occupants as assessed in each year and who by section 135 is furnished with a duplicate of the collector\u2019s returned rolls every year would require to do no more than refer to these rolls upon receipt from the treasurer of a list of the lots upon which there is said to be an arrear of taxes for three years for the purpose of seeing whether the lands enumerated on that list are occupied or not, but he would require information otherwise to ascertain whether any of the lands on the list and which upon the rolls in his possession appear to have been assessed as unoccupied have since become occupied, and that this is the object for which the clerk is required to place in the hands of the assessors the list of lots in arrear furnished by the treasurer sufficiently appears, as was held by Burton C.J., from section 143 of the Act which enacts that the clerk shall examine the assessment roll when returned by the assessor to ascertain whether the lands on the list furnished by the treasurer are returned on the assessment roll as then occupied, and that he shall forthwith furnish the treasurer with a list of the several parcels which appear on the resident roll as having become occupied, and the treasurer thereupon, s. s. 2, shall render to the clerk an account of all arrears of taxes due on such occupied lands, and by s. s. 3, the clerk of the municipality is directed on making out the collector\u2019s roll of the current year to add such arrears of taxes to the taxes assessed against such occupied lands that is plainly as it appears to me such lands as since the last assessment roll have become occupied, in order that the taxes in arrear upon lands assessed as unoccupied may be collected by distress if necessary against the person who has become, and in the current year is assessed as the occupant. The construction put upon this section by Burton C.J. appears to me to be the true one.\nThe appeal therefore must, I think, be dismissed with costs, and as to the notice given to the appellants by the respondent that upon the argument of the appeal he would ask that the judgment in his favour should be varied by increasing the amount adjudged to him for damages, that application is refused. In view of the grounds upon which the learned trial judge determined the question of the fact as to payment of the tax of 1891, in full, as was insisted by the respondent, we are of opinion that the damages awarded by the Divisional Court judgment gave ample compensation to the respondent.\nAs the claim of the respondent for an increase of the amount adjudged does not appear to have increased the cost of the appeal it is unnecessary to say anything as to costs upon our refusal of the respondent\u2019s application.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Thomas Caswell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Caston & Co.\n[1] 26 Ont.

S. C. c. 135 s. 29 (a).\nTo an action claiming $325 as penalties for an offence against the Pharmacy Act, the pleas were : 1. General denial. 2. That the Act was ultra vires. In the courts below the action was dismissed. for want of proof of the alleged offence.\nHeld, Strong C. J. and Gwynne J. dissenting, that an appeal would lie to the Supreme Court that if the court should hold that there was error in the judgment which held the offence not proved the respondent be etitled to a decision on his plea of ultra vires and the appeal would therefore lie under sec. 29 (a) of the Supreme Court Act.\nMOTION to quash an appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court by \"which the action was dismissed.\nThe grounds for the motion to quash are stated in the above head-note.\nFitzpatrick Q.C. Solicitor General for Canada for the motion referred to City of Sherbrooke v. McManamy ([1]); Longueuil Navigation Go. v. City of Montreal ([2]).\nLajole, contra, cited Blachiford v. McBain ([3]). The judgment of the majority of the court, TASCHEREAU, SEDGEWICK and GIROUAED was delivered by :\nTaschereau J.\u2014This case comes up on a motion to quash the appeal. The appellant sued the respondent under the \" Quebec Pharmacy Act,\" 53 Vict. c. 46, for $325, amount of certain penalties for keeping open shops for retailing drugs without a license against the provisions of that Act. The respondent fyled a plea of general denial accompanied with a plea that the Act in question was ultra vires of the legislature of Quebec. In the Superior Court the action was dismissed for want of proof ([4]). That judgment was con firmed upon the same grounds by the Court of Appeal, neither court having to pass on the question of ultra vires. The appellant now claims the right to appeal to this court from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, on the ground that the matter in controversy involves the question of the validity of the said \" Quebec Pharmacy Act.\"\nI am of opinion that the appeal lies. The unconstitutionality of the Act having been pleaded by the respondent, if we should be of opinion that the appellant has proved its case and that there is error, on that point, in the judgment appealed from, the respondent would then have the right to argue the constitutional point before this court and ask that if the appellant's action be not dismissed for want of proof, as it was in the courts below, it be nevertheless dismissed on the ground that the statute upon which it is based was ultra vires of the Quebec legislature. Longueuil Navigation Co. v. City of Montreal ([5]). On the part of the respondent the case of The City of Sherbrooke v. McManamy ([6]) has been cited as supporting his contention that the present case is not appealable. But there the case settled by the judge of the Court of Queen's Bench for the appeal to this court, as I have ascertained by the printed record itself was confined exclusively to the question whether the by-law there in question was authorized by the statute upon which it assumed to be based. King v. Pinsoneault ([7]). Consequently, the constitutional question had been abandoned and could not under any circumstances be raised before this court. That case is therefore clearly distinguishable from the present one. It must be upon the appeal before this court that the constitutional question is in controversy upon the record to give us jurisdiction. The fact alone that it has been in controversy in the courts below cannot render the case appealable, if that controversy for some reason or another is at an end and cannot be re-opened before this court. In the case of City of Sherbrooke v. McManamy ([8]) it could not. Here it can. Bennett v. Missouri Pacific Railway Co. ([9]); The Slate of Louisiana v. Tsni Ho ([10]); The State, ex rel. Lamarque v. Burthe ([11]); City of New Orleans v. Hill ([12]) The State of Louisiana v. Deffes ([13]).\nIn Blachford v. McBain ([14]), the judgment appealed from had dismissed the action upon the ground of want of jurisdiction without passing upon a plea which involved a controversy as to a title to real property, the only ground upon which the case could be brought to this court. This court held that the plaintiff had the right to appeal from that judgment because the controversy as to the title to real property, though not adjudicated upon in the courts below, still appeared upon the pleadings. The fact that we may have to pass upon a point which the courts below overlooked, or which they had not to pass upon because they disposed of the case on other grounds, cannot affect our jurisdiction.\nIf the constitutional point is raised by the plead ings it does not lie in the power of the provincial courts to take away the right of appeal to this court by refraining to adjudicate upon it.\nThe judgment of the dissenting judges, the Chief Justice and Gwynne J., was delivered by :\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The appellants sued the defendant\nfor the sum of $325 claimed to be due to the appellants for certain penalties alleged to have been incurred by the defendant in virtue of the provisions of an Act of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec, 53 Vict. c. 46, for retailing, as was alleged, drugs without a license for that purpose. To that action the respondent pleaded, 1st. a plea of general denial, and kindly, that the Act m question was ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature. The court rendered judgment dismissing the action upon the ground that, without any reference to the plea of ultra vires, the plaintiffs failed to prove the acts complained of as having been committed by the defendant in contravention of the Act, thus deciding the action upon the plea of general denial only. Having disposed of the action upon this ground it became wholly unnecessary for the court to adjudicate, and they therefore did not adjudicate, upon the question of ultra vires. Upon that question the judgment dismissing the plaintiff's action has no effect what ever. And the question now as it appears to me simply is : Have the appellants a right to appeal from the judgment which dismissed their action on the above grounds, for the purpose of obtaining the judgment of this court upon the question of ultra Vires which Was\nnot adjudicated, upon or necessary to be adjudicated upon for the purpose of supporting the judgment which was pronounced in the action, and by this means open an appeal in respect of the matters upon which the court has adjudicated, which matters per se are not appealable? In my opinion the appellants have no such right. From the judgment as rendered there is no appeal. Neither the Longueuil Navigation Co. v. City of Montreal ([15]), nor City of Sherbrooke v. McManamy ([16]), nor Blachford v. McBain ([17]), has any application to the present case. In the two former cases the question of ultra vires was adjudicated upon in the court below, and such adjudication was the basis upon which the judgments rested, and in the latter the sole point was whether the facts of the cause of action being within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court although the action was instituted in the Superior Court, was sufficient cause for depriving the appellant of a right of appeal which otherwise existed.\nIf this court should now adjudicate upon the question of ultra vires upon the record in the present case it would not be acting as a Court of Appeal from a judgment affecting that question, but as a court of first instance. In my opinion the appeal should be quashed with costs.\nMotion refused with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Drouin, Pelletier & Belanger.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Robitaille & Roy.\n[1] 18 Can.

Il s'agit ici d'une de ces nombreuses poursuites en dommages intent\u00e9es contee la cite de Montr\u00e9al par suite de la confusion de sa legislation , sur l'\u00e9largissement de ses rues\nEn 1895, elle obtient de la legislature de Qu\u00e9bec l'autorisai ion de ne pas\nex\u00e9cuter les ameliorations dont le co\u00fbt \u00e0 Ia charge en tout ou en partie de la cite, excedera les limites du pouvoir d'emprunt, sans pr\u00e9judice des recours en loi pour les dommages, les pertes et les d\u00e9penses encourus r\u00e9ellement par suite de Ia non-ex\u00e9cution des dites ameliorations ([1]).\nArm\u00e9e de ce pouvoir, la cite abandonna l'\u00e9largissement de la rue St Antoine. De l\u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente action de Ia part d'un propri\u00e9taire riverain qui r\u00e9clame des dommages consid\u00e9rables pour d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, pertes de loyer, etc. La cour de premiere instance accorda onze mille cinq cent cinquante-neuf dollars de ces deux chefs savoir trois mille cinq cent cinquante-neuf dollars pour perte de loyer, et huit mille dollars pour dommages \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Ce jugement fut infirm\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel et l'action d\u00e9bout\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens les juges Blanchet et Ouimet dissidents qui \u00e9taient d'avis d'accorder deux mille dollars pour pertes de loyer. Il s'agit done d'une simple question de faits o\u00f9 les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs sont divis\u00e9s trois juges contre trois. Nous croyons que les juges dissidents avaient raison et nous sommes d'avis de maintenir l'action au montant de deux mille sept cent soixante et trois dollars et dix-neuf cents pour pertes de loyer, avec int\u00e9ret et les d\u00e9pens devant toutes les cours et nous croyons ne pouvoir mieux nous expliquer l\u00e0-dessus qu'en reproduisant les remarques de M. le juge Blanchet.\nQuels sont les dommages, les pertes et les d\u00e9penses \u00e9tablis par le present intim\u00e9 ?\nIl r\u00e9clame d'abord $4,085, pour pertes de loyer de 1892 \u00e0 1897.\nIl est \u00e9tabli par les t\u00e9moins Dugas, Harris, Savage, deMartigny, Manseau, que depuis 1892 la location des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qui devaient \u00eatre expropri\u00e9es sur la rue St. Antoine est devenue tr\u00e8s difficile, par\u00e9e que les propri\u00e9taires ne pouvaient plus donner de baux \u00e0 long terme, surtout pour des magasins comme ceux de l'intim\u00e9, et que ne voulant pas laisser leurs b\u00e2tisses inoccup\u00e9es ils \u00e9taient forc\u00e9s d'aceepter des locataires \u00e0 prix r\u00e9duits et qui tr\u00e8s souvent ne les payaient pas.\nHarris jure positivement qu'en 1892. les loyers des b\u00e2tisses de l'intim\u00e9 s'\u00e9levaient \u00e0 $226.80 par mois et qu'en 1894 et 1895,la diminution des loyers a \u00e9t\u00e9 de $90 jar mois, ce qui pour ces deux ann\u00e9es seulement, formerait un montant de $2,184, et ils ajoutent, avec un grand nombre d'antres t\u00e9moins que cette diminution de loyer a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par Ia perspective alors imminente de l'expropriation que la cite \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 faire\nMais cet' \u00e9tat de chose avait cesse au ler mai 1896 car l-i nouvelle loi \u00e9tait alors en force et l'intim\u00e9 ne peut riei r\u00e9clamer de ce chef au del\u00e0 de cette date car ii a pu alors donner des baux \u00e0 long terme et faire ses b\u00e2tisses toutes les r\u00e9parations n\u00e9cessaires\nLe jugement qui lui accorde $3,559 de dommages doit donc \u00eatre modifi\u00e9\nEn effet il est \u00e9tabli par ses propres t\u00e9moins que la diminution de ses loyers due \u00e0 l'expropriation annonc\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 de $36 pour l'ann\u00e9e 1893-1694 et de $638.72 pour chacune des ann\u00e9es 1894-1695 Ce qui forme une somme totale de $1313.44.\nD'une autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, il est aussi constat\u00e9 que pendant ces trois ann\u00e9es, l'intim\u00e9 a perdu $1,975,75 qu'il n'a Pu retirer des locataires pauvres qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 d'accepter pour ne pas laisser ses b\u00e2tisses inoccup\u00e9es.\nIl est vrai que les experts de la cite, Rielle, Resther et Chartrand, se basant sur les chiffres des cotiseurs et sur des rensigenements obtenus des locataires disent que les loyers au lieu de diminuer ont augment\u00e9 et qu'ils Ctaient de $17300 en 1892 et de $2,030 en 1896, tandis que D\u00f9gas et Harris affirment quills ont de fait diminu\u00e9 de $1,313444 de 1893 \u00e0 1896.\nIl y a l\u00e0 une contradiction manifeste, mais les experts de la cite ne s'appuient que sur des oui-dires, le rapport des cotiseurs et des d\u00e9clarations des locataires, tandis que Dugas et Harris parlent des faits arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 leur connaissance et n'avaient en outre aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 laisser \u00e9chapper leurs locataires sans les faire payer si la chose avait \u00e9t\u00e9 possible et leur t\u00e9moignage doit en consequence \u00eatre pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 sur ce point \u00e0 celui des t\u00e9moins de la cite.\nPour ces raisons nous sommes d'avis d'accorder le montant total de ces pertes savoir $1313.44 et $1,975 75 dont ii faut d\u00e9duire $526 pour les taxes ordinaires de 1895 et 1896 que l'appelant offre de payer, formant une somme totale de $2,763.19, que l'intrm\u00e9e doit payer \u00e0 l'appelant avec in\u00ee\u00e9r\u00e9t du jour de la signification de l'action et les d\u00e9pens.\nL'action est done maintenue pour autant et l'appel accord\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Archer & Perron.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Ethier & Archambault,\n[1] 59 Vict c 49 s. 17.\n",

C. P, (Old Text) Appeal\u2014Questions of procedure.\nThe right of action for damages for personal injuries sustained by a married woman, commune en biens, belongs exclusively to her-husband and she cannot sue for the recovery of such damages in her own name even with the authorization of her husband.\nWhere it appears upon the face of the writ of summons and statement of claim that the plaintiff has no right of action, it is not necessary that objection should be taken by exception \u00e0 la forme. Absolute want of legal right of action may be invoked by a~ defendant at any stage of a suit.\nJudgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, 3 Q. P. R. 1, over-ruled on. the motifs but affirmed in its result\nAppeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's-Bench for Lower Canada, appeal side ([1]), affirming the judgment of the Court of Review at Montreal ([2]) which reversed the judgment entered in the Superior' Court District of Montreal, upon a verdict in favour of the plaintiff and dismissed the action.\nThe plaintiff, a married woman, brought the action for the recovery of damages suffered by her through bodily injuries caused by a collision which was-alleged to have occurred in consequence of the defend- ant's negligence. Her husband was made a party to the action for the purpose only of authorizing her to sue. The defence raised no question as to the plaintiff's right of action and upon verdict by the jury judgment was entered in her favour in the Superior Court. The defendant then inscribed the cause for revision, and, for the first time, raised the question that the right of action belonged to the husband alone and could not be exercised by his wife even with his authorization. The Court of Review on this ground, reversed the judgment of the Superior Court, set aside the verdict and dismissed the action with costs.\nOn appeal, the Court of Queen's Bench was of opinion that, by pleading to the merits without contesting the plaintiff's right of action, the defendant had waived the right to invoke that ground, but held, (Hall J. dissenting), that the action had been properly dismissed on the merits.\nMacmaster Q C. and F S Maclennan Q. C. for the appellant. Decisions of provisional courts on questions of procedure should not be interfered with on an appeal to this court ; Ferrier v. Trepannier ([3]). It was too late by the inscription in review to raise questions as to form of action. The judgment now appealed from holds that the defendant could not raise that question after verdict and judgment. Gladwin v. Cummings ([4]) ; Dawson v. Union Bank ([5]) ; Mayor of Montreal v. Brown ([6]); Boston v. Leli\u00e8vre ([7]). All informalities and nullities in the writ of service are expressly waived by the appearance of the defendant and failure to take advantage of them ; Art. 119 C C. P. Exception \u00e0 la forme was compulsory Arts. 116-119 C. C. P. Art 1298 C.C. does not vest the husband with the exclusive power to exercise the wife's rights of action; it is permissive. He may \"stand by \" and allow his wife to exercise them with his assent or with the authorization of a judge. She is not ousted of the right of action merely because her husband may exercise it. When both join there can be no question. Art 1272 0 C does not include recovered damages for personal injuries, but only property reduced into possession. A married woman authorised by her husband may sue for damages for personal wrongs,'see Waldron v White ([8]) followed in Simmons v Elliott ([9]); Turcotte v. Nolet ([10]) Brisbois v. Simard ([11]). See also Ruckwart v. Bazin ([12]) ; Charest v. Tessier ([13]) ; Bonneau v. Laterreur ([14]), and Art. 1282 C. C.\nMany of the commentators and leading cases in France support this contention; Coutume d'Orl\u00e9ans, Art. 200 ; Pothier, Puissance du Mari, no. 6 ; 1 Baudry-Lacantinerie Coat. de Mar. p. 564, no. 734 p. 567 ; Dal. '58,2, 114; 86, 2, 38; '96, 2, 91; '98, 1, 121; S. V. '87, 2, 67.\nStuart Q.C. and Francis McLennan for the respondent. The right of action alleged belongs to the husband and under the regime de la communaut\u00e9 can be exercised by him alone. This defect is apparent upon the face of the summons and declaration and need not be pleaded by exception \u00e0 Ia forme. ; it can be invoked at any stage of the proceedings without special pleadings. Arts. 387, 1272, 1292, 1298 C. C. Pothier Com. nos. 72 77 497' 1 Guillouard, no. 863; Dal. Rep. vo. Con. de Mar. nos. 583, 596, Supp. nos. 194,196 200 202. The husband alone can bring an action for and on behalf of the community, the wife cannot do so ; C. C. 1292 ; C. N. 1421 ; Pand. Fr, vo. Mariage, nos. 5516 to 5520; Pand. Fr. Rec. '97, 1 382 ; Dal. Rep. vo. Con. de Mar. nos. 1111, 1120, 1124; Cooper V. Cappel ([15]).\nThe want of right of action has been properly raised without special pleadings and there can be no waiver ; the proceedings are null. Forbes v. Atkinson ([16]). The defect is not a mere informality within Art. 116 C. C. P., nor is it of the class of objections generally raised by preliminary exception ; Cole v. Cot\u00e9([17]) ; Thiviergev. Les Cur\u00e9, &c., de St. Vincent de Paul ([18]). The effect of the plaintiff s description is to deprive her of any right to her conclusions, a ground for a demurrer, or motion in arrest of judgment (Art. 431), or for judgment non obstante veredicto (Art. 433), to be urged before the Court of Review under the old procedure but now the trial judge must enter up judgment in accordance with the verdict (Art. 491), and such an objection is heard for the first time in the the Court of Review Arts. 492 to 508 C. P.Q.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by :\nTaschereau J.\u2014The appellant is a married woman, commune en biens, who brought this action for bodily injuries caused to her by the respondent, her husband being joined by the writ for the purpose of authorising her therein. The Court of Review (Taschereau, Gill and Doherty JJ.) dismissed her action on the ground that :\nConsid\u00e9rant que sous le r\u00e9gime de Ia communaut\u00e9 l'action en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 raison d'un d\u00e9lit ou d'un quasi d\u00e9lit dont la femme est victime, est une action mobili\u00e8re, et que Ia cr\u00e9ance n\u00e9e du fait' d\u00e9lictueux ou quasi-d\u00e9lictueux, tombe dans la communaut\u00e9 qu'en cons\u00e9quence la femme, m\u00eame autoris\u00e9e du mari, ne peut exercer cette action qui appartient au mari seul, et qui doit \u00eatre port\u00e9e eu son nom comme chef de la communaut\u00e9.\nThe Court of Appeal concurred with the Court of Review upon that point, but held that as the defendant had not taken the objection to the appellants right of action by exception to the form, it could not \u2022 avail itself of it. They, however, dismissed the action on the facts of the case, holding that the respondent was not guilty of negligence.\nWe are of opinion that the plaintiff's appeal from that judgment should be dismissed upon the ground that she had, as commune en biens, no right 01 action, and that the defendant was not obliged to plead it by exception to the form.\nUpon the first point, that a married woman, commune en biens, has no right to such an action even with the authorization of her husband, it is not necessary, as we adopt without reserve the ruling of the two courts below thereupon, to cite any authorities. Decisions to the contrary may be found, but o on cite de pareils arr\u00e9ts comme on signale des \u00e9cueils. They are illustrations of the saying \" toutes les erreurs peuvent trouver des arr\u00eats et tous les paradoxes des autorit\u00e9s. \"\nAn attempt has been made to distinguish between an ordinary debt and the damages resulting from a tort on the ground that the former exists before the judgement and the latter are created by the judgment. But that is a fallacy which has received no countenance in the\" courts below, and rightly so. The amount of the sum due for a tort under Art 1053 C. C. is only established by the judgment, but the liability for it exists from the date of the act that caused it ; so much so, that it is from that date that the prescription runs. it is a debt due from the date of the tortious act. Then even if it were the judgment that created the debt for a tort yet the action to have that debt determined would belong to the husband.\nOn the point of pleading we are of opinion with the Court of Review that if on the face of the writ and of the declaration, it appears that the plaintiff has no right of action, it is not necessary for the defendant to plead it by exception to the form. An absolute want of legal right to the action may be invoked by the defendant at any stage of a cause. The female plaintiff sues for a debt which, upon her own allegations, appears to be due to another. That cannot be called an informality, and Arts. 14, 116 and 119 of the old Code of Procedure referred to in the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal have no application. Her action could not be maintained even if the defendant had not appeared.\nI need hardly say that this is not, as contended for by the appellant, one of these questions of procedure upon which this court does not as a general rule interfere with the rulings of the Provincial courts.

III., c. 83 s. 10 (Imp.)\u2014 \u201441 Geo. III., c. 4 (L. C.)\nR. A. who died in Montreal in 1896 had, by his will made there in 1890, bequeathed to M. A. and her heirs, one-fourth of his residuary estate. M. A. died in 1895 leaving a will appointing five of her children her universal legatees. R. A. subsequently took communication of the will of the deceased M. A. and made a codicil to his own will in the terms following:\n\u201cWith respect to the share of the residue of my property which I bequeathed by my will to my sister, the late M. A. * * * my will and desire is that her said share of said residue shall go to her heirs.\u201d\nHeld, Gwynne and Girouard JJ. dissenting, that under the provisions of the Civil Code of Lower Canada, the words \u201c her heirs\u201d in the codicil must be construed as meaning the persons to whom the succession of M. A. devolved as universal legatees under her will.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Lower Canada, (appeal side), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which maintained the plaintiffs\u2019 action with costs.\nThe questions at issue on the appeal are stated in the judgment of the court by His Lordship Mr. Justice Taschereau. The action was brought by the representative of a child of the late Margaret Anderson who was not appointed a legatee under her will to recover a share of her estate, claimed as having passed to her natural heirs, and to compel an account of the administration by the defendants.\nThe trial court ordered judgment to be entered in favour of the plaintiffs and on appeal this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Sir Alexandre Lacoste C.J. and Boss\u00e9 J. dissenting.\nChase-Casgrain Q.C. and Fitzpatrick Q.C. for the appellants, (Travers Lewis with them). When the late Robert Anderson read his deceased sister\u2019s will he made his codicil and used the words \u201chis heirs\u201d to designate the particular persons who had become seized of her succession as universal legatees. The word \u201cheir\u201d in the law of the Province of Quebec has a distinct technical meaning which differs from that of the English law and even of the French modern law.

C. has no application in the construction of the codicil but is merely explanatory of the expression \u201c heirs\u201d when used in the Code. The intention of the testator must be gathered from what is said in the instrument itself, and the word is used there in its ordinary grammatical sense. The dispute here is not as to Margaret Anderson\u2019s estate but as to a portion of the estate of Robert Anderson disposed of in the codicil by giving it to the children, the natural heirs, of his sister, without any reference to any testamentary dispositions she may have made in regard to her own property. He selected his own beneficiaries and expressed his choice by an ordinary well understood expression.\nThe admission of evidence of extrinsic circumstances, such as -knowledge of the terms of his sister\u2019s will, is illegal and cannot, in any case, influence the interpretation of the codicil. Jarman on Wills (5 ed.) pp. 379 et seq., 1654 and Ruleviii.; De Salaberry v. Faribault ([4]), and authorities there cited; Art. 1234 0 0.; Grey v. Pearson, ([5]). The interpretation of a will is more the meaning of language than of law. In the construction of wills the law favours heirs-at-law who cannot be disinherited by conjecture but only by express words and necessary implications. According to the French and English jurisprudence, the word \u201cheir\u2019\u2019 is never construed to mean legatee. Dieu seul peut faire un h\u00e9ritier l\u2019homme ne le peut. 8 Laurent, nn. 469, 478, 479, 480.\nWe also refer to the remarks of Mr. Justice Hall in the court below and the following authorities cited by him: 8 Pothier (ed, Bugnet) \u201c Successions p. 27; 2 Mourlon, Droit Civil, (8 ed,), n. 836 p. 443; Clark v. Cordis ([6]); Re Newton\u2019s Trusts ([7]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTaschereau J.\u2014By his will dated the 20th December, 1890, Robert Anderson bequeathed to his sister Margaret Anderson and her heirs one-fourth of his residuary estate. The said Margaret Anderson died on the 19th of June, 1895, leaving a will, dated the 9th of February preceding, by which she had appointed her five surviving children her universal legatees. On the 17th of July following, Robert Anderson, after having taken communication of his deceased sister\u2019s will, made a codicil in the following terms:\nWith respect to the share of the residue of my property, which I bequeathed by my will to my sister, the late Margaret Anderson, widow of the late John Allan, now deceased, my will and desire is that her said share of the said residue shall go to her heirs.\nHe died in March, 1896.\nWhom did the testator mean by the aforesaid words \u201cher heirs\u201d in that codicil, is the question in controversy. Are these words to be construed as meaning exclusively Margaret\u2019s testamentary heirs, as contended for by the appellants, or as meaning all her heirs-at-law, as contended for by the respondents?\nUnder the Civil Code of the province it is, when there is a will, the person to whom the testamentary succession devolves, the universal legatee, if the testator has appointed one, that is called the heir, and is, in law, the only heir of the deceased. Art. 597 C. C. So that her universal legatees, and they alone, are in law the heirs of Margaret Anderson. Art. 864 C. C. No one else can be called her heir.\nIt cannot be said that one who does not, and cannot inherit is an heir, though, but for a will, he would have been one. He is disinherited. The testator has taken away from him, as he had the right to do, the very name of heir that he otherwise would have been entitled to. Such is the consequence of the unrestricted freedom of disposing by will given by the Acts, 14 G-eo. III. c. 83 (Imp.), and 41 G-eo. III. c. 4 (Lower Canada), re-enacted by Article 831 of the Civil Code.\nUnder the droit coutumier no other heir was known to the law but the natural or legitimate heir, and the word \u201csuccession\u201d applied more correctly to intestate successions, successions conferred by the law. But under the express terms of Article 596 of the Code, the word, in the Province of Quebec, now means a transmission by a will as well as a transmission by the law. And when there is a transmission by a will of the whole of the estate of the deceased, there is no transmission by the law; consequently, there is no heir but the one made such by the will. The universal legatee is the appointed heir, the h\u00e9ritier institu\u00e9. Merlin, Rep. vo. L\u00e9gataire, sec. 1, n. 3, and vo. Instit. d\u2019h\u00e9r., sec. 1, n. 2. Consequently, the words \u201cher heirs\u201d in Robert Anderson\u2019s codicil must be applied exclusively to Margaret\u2019s testamentary heirs.\nThe respondent\u2019s contention that when Robert Anderson made the bequest in question to his sister\u2019s heirs, he intended some one else than her testamentary heirs, imports the irrational consequence that he intended a person or some persons that had no possible existence, and could never have any. They would have us read it as made not to his sister\u2019s heirs but to those who would have been her heirs had she died intestate. We cannot do it. Her will must be read as if it said in express terms \u201cI appoint John, Robert * * * my heirs.\u201d It says nothing else though in different words The words \u201cheir\u201d and \u201cuniversal legatee\u201d are synonymous expressions. Art. 840 C. C.; 6 Huc , p. 404.\nNothing whatsoever of Margaret Anderson\u2019s estate passed to the respondents. In her testamentary heirs alone vested, the right to the action petitio hereditatis to revendicate it had it been in the possession of anyone else at her death. Merlin, Rep. v. H\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9. They alone were then seized of all her rights and of all her property, real and personal. Art, 891 C. C. They alone are liable for her debts and obligations.\nUnder the Coutume de Paris, as at one time in force in the province, it was the heir-at-law who was liable for the debts of the testator even in the case of a will appointing a universal legatee, saving his recourse against the latter for his share. That was the consequence of a system under which a universal legatee was not, and could not be, a legatee of the whole estate, the testator not being allowed to dispose of the reserves nor of the l\u00e9gitime; the droit coutumier then provided for the heirs-at-law, from whom the universal legatee had to get delivery, because said Pothier:\nThe universal legatee is not the heir; in this, the universal legacy differs from the appointment of an heir. Pothier, Donats. Test, vol. 6, p. 318.\nIn the Province of Quebec this difference has disappeared, and the universal legatee is now the heir, and the only heir. As under the Roman law, testamentary heredity and legitimate or natural heredity are incompatible: A testamentary heredity excludes the legitimate heredity. Simmonet, de la Saisine H\u00e9r\u00e9ditaire 13, 145.\nIt is undoubtedly true, as argued at Bar on the part of the respondents, that the heir-at-law has the right to contest the validity of the will, and, if he succeeds, he then is the heir. But he is the heir because there is then no will, because there is then no testamentary heir.\nThe question here, of course, is not what the word u \u201cheir\u201d means generally, or what it means in the Code, but what it means upon the true construction of this codicil, what the testator\u2019s intention was in using it. But it being an incontrovertible proposition that under the Code when there is a will appointing an heir, he is, in law, the only one who can be called heir, or who can assume that title, the onus was upon the respondents to establish beyond all doubt their contention that, in this codicil, the testator used it in a different sense. For it is a universally admitted rule in the construction of wills that when the law has affixed a certain meaning to an expression of this nature, that meaning must be given to it, unless the testator excluded beyond all doubt such construction. Towns v. Wentworth ([8]); De Beauvoir v. De Beauvoir ([9]); Dorin v. Dorin ([10]).\nIn considering the will before us * * * (said the court in the case of The Royal Institution v. Desrivi\u00e8res (4), in words that apply here) we are upon every fair principle led to adopt the legal import of the words therein used.\nThe principle of the English jurisprudence invoked by the respondents, that the law favours the heir-at-law, clearly has no application under a system that denies the very existence of an heir-at-law when there is a testamentary heir. Even the expression of the Code and of all the commentators of the French law, \u201ctestamentary heir\u201d is unknown to the English law. The droit coutumier also favoured the heir-at-law, but as the court said in The Royal Institution v. Desrivi\u00e8res ([11]),\nthe consideration for and favour shewn to the h\u00e9ritier du sang, by the ancient law, has ceased to prevail\nin the province.\nThe appellants\u2019 contention receives strong support from the case of Herse v. Dufaux ([12]), in the Privy Council (not cited at Bar) where their Lordships said upon the construction to be put upon that very same word in the Province of Quebec.\nThe contention of the appellants is that the term \u201cautres h\u00e9ritiers\u201d imports certain 'person\u0153 designat\u0153, viz., the legal heirs of the donor. * * It may be taken for granted that the term \u201cles autres h\u00e9ritiers\u201d if found in a French instrument would necessarily import the legal heirs. * * But it is to be observed that, owing probably in a great measure to the fact that the statute law of Lower Canada has engrafted on the old French law an unlimited power of disposition by will, the word \u201ch\u00e9ritiers\u201d has there acquired a signification wider than and differing from that it would obtain in France.\nAnd their Lordships, citing Article 597 of the Code, held that the word heirs in that case meant the testamentary heirs, and that it was competent to the testator there in question to deprive his grandchildren of the character of \u201cheirs-at-law\u201d that they would have been entitled to in the absence of a will.\nThe respondents\u2019 contentions imply that Article 318 of the Coutume de Paris:\nLe mort saisit le vif son hoir plus proche et habile \u00e0 lui succ\u00e9der\nis still the law of the Province of Quebec. Now that is not so when there is a will disposing of the whole succession, or more correctly speaking, the hoir in such a case, the hoir saisi, is the heir appointed by the will, the h\u00e9ritier institu\u00e9. This was, at one time, a controverted question, but it has been authoritatively settled by the case of Blanchet v. Blanchet ([13]), and since by Article 891 of the Code. Webb v. Hall ([14]); King v. Tunstall ([15]); Art. 831 C. C. The rule \u201cthe appointment of an heir is forbidden\u201d (institution d'h\u00e9ritier n'a pas lieu) is now superseded. The provincial law in the matter is assimilated to the law of the pays de droit\u00e9crit, where the rule was, not as under the coutumes that Dieu seul peut faire des h\u00e9ritiers, but that it is the will of man that makes an heir, the law only intervening by way of exception in default of a will. Merlin, Rep. vo. H\u00e9ritier, vol. v., p. 630; Ferri\u00e8re, Dict, de Dr. vo. H\u00e9ritier; 13 Demol. no. 80; 8 Laurent, nos. 477 et seq.; 5 Toullier, 486; The Royal Institution v. Desrivi\u00e8res ([16]), confirmed in the Privy Council in May, 1828.\nThe respondents\u2019 argument based upon the terminology of the Code and the fact that in many of its enactments the word \u201cheir\u201d means the heir-at-law does not help their contentions. Of course, where as in the chapter on successions for instance, intestate successions alone are in question, the word \u201cheir\u201d applies exclusively to the heir-at-law. In the chapter on wills likewise, when a distinction has to be made between a legatee and an heir-at-law, the word \u201cheir\u201d applies and could then apply only to the heir-at-law. But when no such distinction is necessary to render the enactment intelligible, the word \u201cheir\u201d applies, as the context requires, as well to the testamentary heir as to the heir-at-law. Then Article 597 already referred to, when it decrees in so many words that he who inherits under a will is called \u201cheir\u201d is by itself alone a complete answer to the respondents\u2019 argument on that ground.\nThe respondents further contended that in ordinary language the word \u201cheir\u201d means \u201cheir-at-law.\u201d No doubt that is so in England, and also in France, where the old rules of the droit coutumier on the subject have been in a great measure incorporated in the Code Napoleon. In the Province of Quebec, likewise, when speaking of an intestate succession, the word \u201cheir\u201d has that same meaning. But when speaking of the succession of any one who has bequeathed his estate to a universal legatee, the word \u201cheir\u201d in plain language means that legatee, the person made heir by the will of the testator.\nIf Robert Anderson on the day he made his codicil had been asked who were his deceased sister\u2019s heirs he would have answered that she had left John, Robert * * * as her heirs, that she had appointed them her heirs. The word \u201cheir\u201d in popular language is used as a word of succession, and, under a system and in a country where testamentary successions are the rule, and legitimate successions or successions conferred by law the exception, when used in relation to the succession of any one who by his will has appointed an heir, it means the testamentary heir. Herse v. Dufaux ([17]).\nConsiderable stress was laid by the respondents upon the terms of certain parts of the will of Robert Anderson, in which it may be that the word \u201cheir\u201d means \u201c heir-at-law \u201d; but in my view of the case the terms of the codicil are so clear, so free from doubt, that not to adhere strictly to what they say would be assuming the risk of making a bequest for the testator. It was for the very purpose of ascertaining whom Margaret Anderson had appointed her heirs that he asked to have communication of her will before making this codicil. He then knew that her only heirs were her universal legatees, and when he subsequently made a bequest to \u201cher heirs\u201d he must be taken to have meant what he said.\nMoreover, if in his will, Robert Anderson by the word \u201cand to her heirs\u201d meant his sister\u2019s heirs-at-law, it does not follow that when he made this codicil after her death, and because of her death, he meant to use the same words in the same sense. Quite the contrary. He made this codicil purposely, it is evident, not to leave anything of her share but to those whom she herself had since appointed her heirs, so that it should pass as it would have passed under her will had he died before her. He clearly intended to alter the bequest that he had made by his will to her heirs-at-law, as he altered by another clause of this same codicil the bequest he had made by the 39th clause of his will to his cousin Watson\u2019s heirs-at-law.\nIt was further argued on behalf of the respondents that Robert Anderson could not have meant the same persons in the first and third clauses of this codicil because he merely used the words \u201cher heirs,\u2019\u2019 heirs of Margaret, in the first clause, whilst in the third clause he mentioned the names of those to whom he bequeathed the lapsed share of his cousin Watson, though they are Margaret\u2019s only testamentary heirs. I do not see much weight in that argument. It certainly was not absolutely necessary so to describe them nominatively in the third clause, but he did so, it would appear, because they were not the heirs of Watson whose lapsed legacy he by this third clause desired to provide for as he had done for Margaret\u2019s share by the first clause. He could hardly have been expected in a bequest to them by a separate clause of Watson\u2019s share to describe them as Margaret\u2019s heirs. No doubt he might have made both bequests by one and the same clause. But the fact that he did not do it does not, under the circumstances, at all tend to prove that the two bequests were not intended for the same parties. In the will, each bequest is in a separate clause, and the codicil follows that course.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the action dismissed with costs.\nI deliberately refrain from referring to the English authorities quoted by the parties. Upon a branch of the provincial law so completely at variance with the English law as this one is, they could not, it is obvious, but mislead, though I am quite sure they were not quoted with the intention of misleading. The case is governed exclusively by the Civil Code of the province wherein the law which obtains on the subject is to be looked for. McGibbon v. Abbott ([18]); Herse v. Dufaux ([19]). And not only must also the French Code and its commentators be read with caution as the differences between it and the Quebec Code in the matter are very great, but in any reference to the droit coutumier itself, the changes introduced in the province by the statutes of 1774 and 1801 have to be constantly kept in mind.\nGWYNNE J. (dissenting).\u2014The only question in this case is as to the construction to be put upon the word \u201cheirs\u201d as used in a codicil to the will of the late Robert Anderson which is in the words following:\nWith respect to the share of the residue of my property which I bequeathed by my will to my sister the late Margaret Anderson widow of the late John Allan, now deceased, my will and desire is that her said share of the said residue shall go to her heirs.\nDuring the argument before us an emphatic opinion was expressed from the court that the rule governing the case is that the word \u201cheirs\u201d as here used must be construed in its ordinary and natural sense unless there be something in the will or codicil, the former of which contained 45, and the latter 4 clauses, which shews the intention of the testator to have been to use the word in a special, limited, peculiar sense.\nI so thoroughly agree with the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Hall, in the Court of Appeal, which in my opinion has in a most exhaustive manner treated the subject that I only think it necessary to add, with great deference, that in my opinion any other conclusion than that which that learned Judge has arrived at would operate as a distortion of the rule governing the case, which is that the intention of the testator to use the word in the special sense contended for by the appellants must be found in the instrument itself, that is to say in the will and codicil thereto, in which the word is used.\nI am of opinion therefore, that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting).\u2014The question is not whether testamentary heirs exclude heirs at law; it is whether or not the respondents are sole testamentary heirs, and I have no hesitation in saying that they are not. The late Mr. Robert Anderson did not declare that they were, and the will of his sister Margaret is insufficient to make them so. The testator simply provided in his codicil that her share should go to her \u201cheirs,\u201d which in law and in common parlance, and within the terms of his will, means all her \u201cchildren\u201d or natural heirs. I entirely concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Hall.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McGibbon, Casgrain, Ryan & Mitchell.\nSolicitor for the respondents: W. G.

Aylen Q.C. for the appellant. The transaction which served, as consideration for the notes sued on is prohibited by the policy of the law providing for equal distribution of assets amongst an insolvent's creditors and contrary to good morals and public order.

The transaction was merely a sale by the bank of its claim against the insolvent estate and, after being duly approved by the judge's order, the transfer was made accordingly. Subsequently, to simplify matters, the appellant consented to the respondent receiving from Greorge C. Wright on account of his promissory note, the 30 cents in the dollar which the latter had undertaken to pay, and credit was given in the usual manner Arts. 1715 1716 C. C.

V. \"74-1-127 ; and Beausoleil v. Normand ([17]). As there is no legislative prohibition nor an Insolvent Act whereby the majority of creditors could bind the remainder to conditions of composition and discharge, nothing, as between debtor and creditor could invalidate an agreement by the debtor undertaking to pay such creditor more than the amount of the composition and a promissory note given for such excess is valid.

Lemay ([22]), and authorities there cited.\nIn this instance, four inspectors advocated the transfer before the agreement was made and it did not affect the assets of the insolvents. The appellant's relationship to the insolvents and George C. Wright was sufficient consideration for the note The appellant cannot invoke his own fraud and perfidy.

B. Wright & Sons, other than the respondent.\nThe facts are not complicated, and may be concisely stated as follows : The firm of C. B. Wright & Sons having abandoned their property for the benefit of their, creditors under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure relating to cessions of property contained in Articles 853 to 892 inclusively, the defendant, Thomas George Brigham, Mr. Anderson of the Union Bank, Mr. Hector Mc Rae, Mr. Campbell and Mr. de Martigny, the general manager of the respondent's bank were appointed inspectors of the estate,. and Mr. Hyde was named as curator. Of the five inspectors, three were creditors in their own right, and. the other two Mr Anderson and Mr. de Martigny, were the officers and representatives of banks which. were large creditors. George C. Wright, a son of one-and a brother of the other partner in the insolvent firm, proposed to purchase the assets for an amount sufficient to pay privileged creditors in full, and the-unprivileged creditors a dividend of thirty cents in the dollar on the amount of their debts.\nThis proposition having been submitted to the inspectors, it was, on the 8th of November, 1894, at a meeting of those persons, accepted by all but de Martigny, the respondent's general manager, who expressly dissented. from the resolution in which the approval of the offer by the other inspectors was recorded. Subsequently,. by a secret arrangement between George C. Wright and Mr. de Martigny acting on behalf of the respondent bank, it was agreed that the respondent should be paid ten cents in the dollar more than the other creditors, that is to say, forty per cent of their debt, and. that in consideration of this arrangement which was-to be kept secret from the other creditors, and also in. consideration of $150 to be paid to Mr. de Martigny for his own personal use, he (de Martigny), should withdraw his objection as one of the inspectors, and the Banque Jacques-Cartier should accept the forty cents in satisfaction of their interest in the assets. This arrangement, as far as regards the acceptance of the forty cents was assented to by the directors of the respondent bank.\n. Mr. de Martigny having refused to accept the note of George 0. Wright for the additional ten per cent to be paid to the bank, the latter having no other means of paying the excess over the thirty per cent, applied to the present appellant who was his brother~in~law, to secure the payment of the additional amount to de Martigny's satisfaction, and also to pay de Martigny the $150 he was to receive as a bonus for his services in the matter.\nIn order to carry out this arrangement a meeting was held on the 27th of November, 1894, at the office of the solicitor of the bank in Hull where there appears to have been present besides Mr. McDougall (the solicitor and a\u00bb mis~en~cause in the present action), Mr. de Martigny, George C. Wright and the appellant. The latter then signed, a promissory note for the sum of $7,666.55, being forty per cent of the full amount of the respondent's claim against the estate according to the dividend sheet settled by the curator, also a cheque purporting to be dra\/wn by the appellant on the Quebec Bank of Ottawa in favour of Mr. de Martigny for $150.\nThese securities having been placed in the hands of Mr. McDougall, and Mr. de Martigny having also deposited with him all the notes and securities held by the bank for their debt to be delivered up to the respondent on payment of the respondent's claim as well as of the cheque a memorandum signed by Mr. McDougall, as trustee, which is set forth in the decla- ration, was drawn up and signed by him whereby the arrangement with Mr. de Martigny was described as a sale by the hank of its debt and claim to the appellant and whereby it was agreed that the documents mentioned as having been signed by the appellant should. be held by Mr. McDougall as a trustee until the sale of the estate to George C Wright and the transfer in pursuance of such sale should be completed by payment of the purchase money.\nOn the same day, Mr. Justice Malhiot, a judge of the Superior Court, authorised the proposed sale of the estate to George C. Wright at the price mentioned in the letter of the latter to the curator dated 30th October, 1894, therein referred to, namely, a sum sufficient to pay the privileged debts in full and thirty cents in the dollar on the unprivileged debts, and the learned judge signed an order accordingly. This order was made upon the withdrawal of all opposition by Mr. de Martigny and the respondent bank.\nThere was no communication either to the judge who so made the order, or to the inspectors other than de Martigny and the appellant, or to the curator, Hyde, or to any of the other creditors of the secret agreement of the 27th of November 1894 which had as before mentioned, been entered into between Mr. de Martigny on behalf of the respondent and the appellant.\nThe attempt to give this transaction the colour of a sale by the respondent of its debt or claim to the appellant was just one of those fraudulent contrivances which so often recoil against those who resort to them* So far from helping the respondent's case it assists to prove the fraudulent character of the transaction as regards the general body of the creditors.\nIn the divident sheet dated the 10th of July 1895 prepared and signed by John Hyde, the curator to the estate, the respondent is collocated as a creditor for the full amount of its claim $18953 55 and. the dividend to wlhich it was entitled therein at thirty cents in the dollar is put down at $5 685 91. This latter amount was, months after the bank had pretended to sell its debt to the appellant received by the bank itself and credited as a payment on the promissory note of the appellant for the balance of which alone, after deducting the payment, this action is brought.\nHow the respondent could have honestly and rightfully claimed and received payment of the thirty cents in the dollar out of the estate if it really had sold and transferred the debt to the appellant is not explained. The inference must be and is that the arrangement so carefully cloaked and concealed from all those who were interested in frustrating it was in substance and in reality nothing less than an agreement by which the bank was to receive ten per cent more than the other creditors, induced by a money payment of $150 secured to de Martigny by the cheque deposited with Mr. McDougall, and the concealment practised by the parties shews their consciousness of the fraudulent and illegal character of the arrangement they had entered into.\nThe law applicable to such an agreement cannot be and is not doubtful. Where the law carefully provides for the equal distribution of assets amongst creditors any arrangement concealed from the general body of creditors, whereby the policy of the law is defeated, and. a particular creditor having no legal right to preference or priority, is secured an advantage over the other creditors must, under every system of law be void as a fraud on those to whom another is so preferred in the distribution of assets. Cokshott v Bennett ([25]) Jackson v. Lomas ([26]); Eastabrook v. Scott ([27]); Jackman v. Mitchell ([28]); Mare v. Sandford ([29]). All the ground, of fairness, common honesty and public policy which have led to the establishment of the principle by the English courts that such an arrangement cannot stand are equally applicable under the Quebec Code.\nThat the additional amount which, under the secret agreement, was in the present case to be paid to the respondent, was guaranteed and to be paid in the first instance by a third person, the appellant, who was to take no direct interest in the purchased assets, can make no difference. Upon a principle well established by the English courts such a payment by a third person is just as much a fraud on the general body of creditors as a payment or an agreement to pay by the insolvent debtor himself. Wells v. Girling ([30]); Knight v. Hunt ([31]) Bradshaw v. Bradshaw ([32]) ; McKewan v. Sanderson ([33]); Re Milner ([34]).\nFor these reasons the promissory note sued upon must be considered as wholly void, as having been given in furtherance of a fraudulent and corrupt agreement, and the judgment recovered on it cannot stand. To decide otherwise would be to subvert all those principles of equality in the payment of creditors which the articles of the Code providing for abandonment were destined to secure.\nThere remains the question of. the $150 cheque payable to Mr. de Martigny and signed by the appellant That is not sued upon in this action, but it is material as shewing that for this personal advantage in addition to the extra ten cents on the dollar to be paid to the respondent de Martigny was induced to allow himself to be influenced to consent to a sale which as he says himself, was not for the general benefit of the creditors. This $150 cheque was therefore nothing less than an illegal advantage, and for this reason alone the transaction to induce which it was given must he adjudged corrupt, fraudulent and void. The appeal is allowed with costs, and the action must be dismissed without costs. The appellant was himself an inspector and should not have been a party to the agreement with de Martigny.\nGWYNne Sedgewick and King JJ. concurred in the judgment, allowing the appeal with costs in the Supreme Court and dismissing the action without costs. No costs to be allowed in the Court of Review or in the Court of Queen's Bench.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The question raised by the appeal is not whether pending the proceedings for the liquidation of an insolvent estate, a creditor can bona fide sell or transfer his claim to a third party whether a creditor or not, for a sum larger than the amount realised or received by the other creditors but whether one of the inspectors of an insolvent estate, without the knowledge of his Co-inspectors, or of the curator or judge and in violation of his duties as such inspector, can legally bargain for and secure an undue preference with a third party whether related or not to the insolvent in favour of a creditor who is a party to the transaction, fully aware of its nature and object. Is such a contract contrary to public order and public morals ?\nThe facts of the case are not disputed and in order to fully understand the point at issue it is sufficient to reproduce the following remarks of Acting Chief Justice Tait, speaking for the court appealed from :\u2014\nAs I have stated, Mr. de Martigny, general manager of the was appointed one of the inspectors of the estate. Under the law it is the duty of the judge, upon demand of a party interested, to appoint upon the advice of the creditors, inspectors or advisers. (Arts. 769 and 772 C. C. P. (old) ; Arts. 867 and 877 (new). Those gentlemen, in accepting that position, became officers of the court like the curator, and like him are subject to its order. It seems to me that an inspector is bound to act in absolute good faith towards the court. Now we have it established in this case that de Martigny first opposed the acceptance of George C Wrights proposition to purchase the balance of the assets although the other inspectors were in favour of that offer. He has stated in his evidence that the plaintiff at first wanted fifty cents on the dollar; that George C. Wright, the purchaser offered him his own note for an additional ten cents, which he refused; that afterwards the Board of Directors told him to accept forty cents on the dollar if he thought best, and that after it was arranged that the bank was to get forty cents, the method of carrying this out was being left to the solicitor. He admits that it was understood that the plaintiff should get the thirty cents-from ,the curator in the same manner as the ordinary creditors, but all he thought of was to settle his bank's claim and did not concern himself about the Union Bank. He admits that it is probable that the Union Bank would have asked for forty cents if they had known that the plaintiff was getting it. I now quote from his evidence at page 7, which is as follows :\nQ. You see this resolution of the inspectors of the 8th of November was not approved of by you. It says,u motion carried, Mr. de Martigny dissenting.\" Would you read the letter recited in that resolution and say if it is the offer of the purchase of this estate that you refer to ?\u2014 A. Yes.\nQ Why did you dissent from that?\u2014A. It was accepted.\nQ. It was accepted afterwards, but you voted against it ?\u2014A. I voted against it at the time because I had not .sold at the time.\nQ. Why did you vote against it ?\u2014A. Because we thought the estate would pay a great deal more than that. That was our impression, and that is my impression yet.\nQ. That has always been your impression ?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And has that always been the impression of the directors of your bank 1 A. Yes.\nAnd at page 11 his evidence is as follows:\nQ. You still were dissenting at this time, the 8th of November ?\u2014A. Yes always dissenting.\nQ. Did you notify your bank that a majority of the inspectors had passed a resolution accepting, as far as they could, the thirty cents ?\u2014 A. Yes.\nQ. What did they say ?\u2014A. They authorised me to refuse it. Q. What steps did they take to protect your refusal ?\u2014A. I left it completely to the lawyer.\nQ. Did you give him instructions to refuse the transfer for the thirty cents ? A. Until the sale was made to Mr. .Brigham, always.\nQ. So it was the intention of the bank to oppose the carrying out of the sale for thirty cents from the start ?\u2014A. Yes, they wanted to get fifty cents.\nQ. And then when this arrangement was made with Mr. Brigham, whatever it was, they withdrew their opposition ?\u2014A. Yes.\nHe states that his intention was to be paid by some one ten cents over the other creditors, and although he does not admit any agreement to keep the matter secret, still he intimates that the reason it was kept a secret was that they did not want the other parties to hear of it. as they might object.\nIt is clear from the proof of record that the other inspectors would not have allowed the sale of the estate to have been made had they known the plaintiff's real motive for withdrawing its opposition to it.\nThe learned Chief Justice could not however disturb the judgment of the Superior Court condemning the third party, that is the appellant, to pay the extra ten per cent, because\nthe proof seems to fall short of establishing conclusively that it was represented to the judge that Mr. de Martigny had withdrawn his opposition. If it had been established to my satisfaction, (continues the learned Chief Justice) that Mr. de Martigny had allowed it to be represented to the judge that he was in favour of this sale while at the same time he was under the belief that the assets were worth more than thirty cents on the dollar and in virtue of that belief had secured by secret arrangement ten cents more than any other creditor. I should have regarded such conduct as wilful deception practised towards the judge, and taken in conjunction with his conduct towards his co-inspectors I should have considered that there was ample ground for reversing this judgment. In such a case I think it should be our duty to see that inspectors act in good faith and above board in their transactions towards their co-inspectors and towards the court.\nAs we understand the case we believe it is of little importance whether the judge was actually deceived or not. We know for a certainty that an attempt was made to deceive him ; that he was not made aware of the transaction concluded with the appellant through one of the inspectors. We have also the evidence of some of the inspectors that, alter the compromise with the bank, Mr. de Martigny recommended v very strongly\" the acceptance of the offer of thirty cents, and that they were all deceived by him Finally we cannot forget that as such inspector, Mr. de Martigny was the \"adviser \" of both the curator and of the judge, and that his duty was clearly to communicate to them his honest opinion as to the value of the estate. He intentionally did not do so at the request of the respondents and for their benefit, because his sole object was to protect a large preference in favour of his bank and a remuneration of $150 for his alleged expanses and fees, or rather a promise from the appellant to \"oay both\nThe Superior court held that the cheque for the $150 was absolutely void and null, and dismissed de Martigny's action, but maintained the claim of the bank for the amount of the preference. We believe that the contract or note to obtain such a preference is likewise null and void and cannot be enforced as being contrary to public order and good morals. The whole transaction savours of a bribe made to a person in a position of trust to violate the duties of his trust To sanction especially such a partial and even corrupt conduct on the part of officers of a court of justice called upon to discharge quasi judicial functions, and to permit any party to it to benefit by the same, would be to destroy the machinery created by the legislature for the honest and equitable realisation and distribution of insolvent estates This court has recently laid down in Gastonguay v. Savoie ([35]) that\nno one having duties of a fiduciary character to discharge should be followed to put his duties in conflict with his interest, and in Lambe v. Armstrong (1), we said that to permit litigants in default\nto take advantage of the irregularities and misdoings of officers of the court would be simply to hinder the administration of justice and destroy the usefulness of courts of law.\nWe are therefore of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and that the action of the respondent should be dismissed without costs, as the appellant was himself one of the inspectors and participated in the fraud. No costs will be allowed in any of the courts below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant : Henry Aylen.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Thomas P. Foran\n[1] Q. R. 16 S.

S. C. R. 309. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, dismissing the appellant's interventions with costs.\nIn a former action by a firm trading under the style of Ayer & Co. against the respondent for the revendication of a quantity of cheese the plaintiffs, Ayer & Co., obtained possession of the cheese, upon the filing of \u00e0 security bond, and sold it. At the trial the action for revendication was dismissed and this judgment was affirmed upon appeal. The respondent then sued upon the bond for the value of the cheese and the appellant filed two interventions claiming, ownership of one-third of the cheese, as a partner, and also another share as assignee of another partner in a firm, alleged to be the owner thereof, and demanded a lien upon its price The interventions set up that appellant, as a partner along with Donald McBean and one Fraser, had been proprietors of the cheese ; that it was from them that Ayer & Co. had derived their title * that through the agency of Donald McBean they had placed the cheese in the hands of respondent to be stored for the partnership at Montreal l that, subsequently, McBean sold the cheese to Bell Simpson & Co, who sold to Ayer & Co. ; that the cheese had never been pledged for advances ; that respondent had no right to make advances thereon, nor had Donald McBean any authority to pledge it or to receive advances thereon and that if any advances had been made, they had been repaid in full and the security released by the dealings had therewith by the respondent Both interventions were dismissed by the Superior Court and, on appeal, this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench.\nA statement of the circumstances under which the action was taken and the questions at issue upon this appeal will be found in the judgment of His Lordship the Chief Justice\nLeet Q.C. for the appellant. Neither of the judgments below is based on the question of chose jug\u00e9e, but what is termed practically chose jug\u00e9e. This is not pretended to be law. There is no chose jug\u00e9e, because the former case did not decide the rights between respondent and intervenant, but only as between the respondent and Donald McBean. Art. .1241, C.C.; Rolland de Villargues, \"Chose jugee\" 36 ; Larombi\u00e8re . 1351, p. 18 ; Pand. Fr. Rep. \" Chose jug\u00e9e\" nn. 832, 446, 563, 637, 647 ; Cooper v. Molsons Bank, ([1]) ; Stuart v. Mlott, ([2]); Muir v. Carter, ([3]).\nAfter the appellant notified the pledge of the position of affairs, the relation bettween the pledge and appellant was that of a creditor and surety. Before notice the pledge might presume that all the produce belonged to Donald McBean and that he could deal with it as he liked, but after notice this could no longer be done. The moment the pledge became aware that the goods did not belong to the factor and that he had no right to pledge them for his personal debt, he could, obtain no lien thereon for any future advances. The goods must be regarded as the property of a third party held as security, and as soon as the advances were paid or the pledged released the principal or dealt with the principal, to the prejudice of the surety, the security would be released. The release of cheese worth $7530, held at the time of the seizure, with full knowledge of the circumstances, without payment, and without appellant's consent, was in bad faith and fraudulent, and the appellant is. entitled to an account of the securities held for the same debt for which this cheese was also pledged. The whole balance was for advances and credits after seizure and after knowledge that the cheese did not belong to the factor and that he had no right to pledge it.

C. and Dickson for the respondent. The seizure of the cheese had no more effect than to make the pledgee aware that the goods did not belong to the pledger. It did not notify him that Donald McBean had no authority to pledge, and could not, for, as a matter of fact, he had that authority. Arts. 1739 et seq. C. C. Such notice could not prevent a valid lien being created upon these goods, nor invalidate the lien previously created. No seizure could take the goods out of the running account in which they had been validly entered. Dalloz, Rep. \" Compee Courant,\" nos. 1, 6, 51, 55, 56. As there are no legal imputations of payments in respect to running accounts, the whole balance of $15,947.655 constitutes a proper lien upon all merchandise received from Donald. McBean and entered in the account and even if the delivery up of some of the cheese is to be considered there would still be a large balance. Moreover, this cheese was not delivered gratuitously, but only on receipt of its market value. We also refer to Roger v. Chapleau ([21]) and Marsolais v. Willett ([22]).\nThe Chief Justice. In 1885 Donald McBean a brother of the respondent, was in partnership with Alexander Dingwall, the present appellant, and one Fraser in a cheese factory near Charlottenburg, in the County of Glengarry, Ontario. Donald McBean, who carried on business near the same place as a factor and dealer in agricultural products was entrusted by his partners with the produce of the factory for the purpose of sale. Donald McBean dealt with the cheese from this factory as he did with all the produce which came from time to time into his hands either as the owner of it by purchase or as the agent or factor for others, that is to say, he consigned it to his brother, George McBean, a commission merchant in Montreal for sale George McBean made large advances on the security of the goods so consigned to him for which he always claimed as security the usual consignee's or factor's lien. Some short time subsequent to the first of August 1885 several lots of cheese, in all about 405 boxes, the product of the Glengarry factory, worth about $2,300, were included in consignments made by Donald McBean to his brother the respondent The partners of Donald McBean in the factory having received no returns for the cheese, the present appellant, Alexander Dingwall, proceeded to Montreal and having demanded the delivery of the cheese from George McBean the latter claimed a lien on it for his general balance for advances made on the security of various consignments of produce received by him.\nAt the time the cheese was so demanded there remained due to Greorge McBean on account of these advances, some $13,000 against and as security for which he held the cheese in question and a quantity of other produce, grain, peas and cheese, belonging either to Donald McBean or to those for whom he acted as a factor and in which Dingwall and fraser, his partners in the cheese factory, had no interest whatever.\nUpon the refusal of Greorge McBean to deliver up the 405 boxes of cheese, the appellant sold, or assumed to sell the same to a firm of Bell, Simpson & Co. who in turn re-sold it to Ayer & Co., the defendants in the present action. No money was paid on either of these sales and there is good ground for inferring from the intervention of the appellant and his claim in the present action that they were merely colourable, made for the purpose of apparently vesting the property in the ultimate transferees, in order that the appellant, Dingwall, might himself make the affidavit required to obtain an order for delivery in the action of revendication which he purposed to institute and did thereupon immediately institute in the name of Ayer & Co. for the specific delivery up of the cheese.\nThe action for r\u00e9vendication being thus pending the defendants Ayer & Co. on giving the required bond securing the re-delivery of the goods, or the payment of their value in case of failure in the action obtained an order of the court for the writ of saisie revendication and thus obtained delivery of the cheese to them through the sheriff. The action then proceeded and was dismissed at the hearing by Mr. Justice Cimon, whose judgment was, on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, affirmed by the latter court. Thereupon the respondent, George McBean, instituted the present action against Ayer & Co., upon the security given in the action for revendication (on the faith of which the goods had been delivered up ) to recover the value of the cheese which had been sold by Ayer & Co. or by. the appellant through them. Ayer & Co. pleaded to the action and the present appellant intervened filing a principal and subsequently an incidental intervention Although issue does not seem to have ever been regularly joined on the appellant's intervention, the parties by consent, as it appears from the judgment of Mr. Justice Grill who heard the cause went to enqu\u00eate and hearing, whereupon the pleas of the defendants and the interventions of the present appellant were all dismissed and judgment was given in favour of the respondent for the amount realised for the cheese sold less a certain proportion thereof which had been transferred by the respondent to one Alexander McBean. Upon appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench the judgment of Mr. Justice Grill was affirmed with costs. From this latter judgment the present appeal has been taken to this court.\nWe have in the notes of Mr. Justice Hall a very full clear and able statement of the grounds in law as well as in fact upon which the judgment now under appeal proceeded, and we entirely concur in the opinion thus expressed. There can be no doubt that Donald McBean either as a partner in the business of the cheese factory or as the factor of the firm or company which carried on the manufacture, had authority in law effectually to pledge the cheese in question with George McBean for advances made to him by the latter. The authority of Donald McBean to pledge the cheese as he did cannot be doubted in view of article 1740 of the Civil Code and the right of the respondent to retain the property so pledged for the general balance due to him by his principal is equally clear under the same article 1740, and article 1975 of the same code.\nThere exists no law \"warranting any such position as that assumed by the appellant who insists that it was the duty of the respondent so soon as he had notice from Dingwall that the cheese was the property of the firm and not of Donald McBean personally so to impute the credits for moneys received from the sales of other goods held in pledge by the respondent as to liberate this cheese from any lien or charge created by Donald McBean. Under the article 1740 which is a re-enactment of the law as embodied in the British Factors Acts the pledge or lien holder is, in all respects in the same position as if the factor or agent giving the security was himself the absolute owner of the property.\nEqually groundless is the contention of the intervenant that the respondent on receiving notice of the rights of the intervenant and Fraser was bound so to deal with the property held in security as not to prejudice their rights and that he therefore lost all claim to a lien on the cheese when he released other property deposited with him in security by Donald McBean. The answer to this is the same as that given to the former contention, namely, that the pledge holder can deal with the property as freely as if the factor or consignor creating the pledge were the absolute owner. Further there is a complete answer to this last point on the facts, since it clearly appears in the evidence that the property released was not given up gratuitously but only on payment of $8,000 which was its then market value.\nFor these reasons therefore, which are the same as those in the Court of Appeal, the judgment in first instance was properly affirmed. There is an additional ground for holding the appellant disentitled to maintain his intervention which is pointed out in the respondent's factum. It is proved that after the delivery up of the cheese taken under the saisie revendication, it was sold and the proceeds received by the defendants, Ayer & Co. The goods therefore no longer remained in specie and, if the sale to Ayer & Co. was genuine the recourse of the intervenant against them, supposing him to be still unpaid, would be a pure money demand\u2014an ordinary debt. How this can give the appellant any locus stanai to intervene in the present action it is hard to see. There is no allegation that the firm of Ayer & Jo. was a mere pr\u00eate-nom for the appellant or that they in any way re-transferred the property in the cheese to the intervenant. Therefore there is really no foundation for the claim set up by the intervention as the case is presented. If on the other hand, Ayer & Co. in any way represented the intervenant in the former action or if the case really is that they have ceded their rights to the intervenant, then the defence of chose jug\u00e9e maintained by the judgment of Mr Justice Grill must be conclusive against the intervention.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nGwynne, Sedgewick and King JJ. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014This case presents no difficulty. The question is simply whether or not a factor has a lien upon and can retain goods consigned to him and in his possession until the advance's in good faith made by him to the consignor in the ordinary course of business have been paid, notwithstanding his knowledge that the consignor was only an agent. An affirmative answer was given in a former suit practically between the same parties, (Ayer v. McBean), in a judgment rendered by the Superior Court and confirmed by the Court of Appeal which was accepted by them as chose Jug\u00e9e and also in the present case. Evidently no other conclusion can be arrived at under articles 1739, 1740, 1742 and 1975 of the Civil Code, and I have no hesitation in dismissing the present appeal for the reasons fully set forth by Mr. Justice Hall in his elaborate opinion.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Seth P.

There was no inventory or process-verlal de carence made and subsequently the survivor contracted a second marriage. In an action by a child of the first marriage claiming a share in continuation of community,\nHeld, that there was no necessity for an inventory of property of such insignificant value and that failure to make an inventory or proc\u00e8s-verbal de carence did not, under the circumstances, effect a continuation of community. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, appeal side ([1]), reversing the judgment of the Court of Review, at Montreal, and restoring the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal ([2]) which maintained the action with costs.\nThe female plaintiff's parents were married at Montreal in 1845 and resided there under the regime de Ia communaut\u00e9 until her father's death in 1846. The entire assess at the time of dissolution of this community consisted of bare necessaries of insignificant value within the class of chattels exempted from seizure under execution. ' The widow made no inventory or proc\u00e8s-verbal de carence, and subsequently, in 1848, married the defendant, Patrick King and they together continued the business of hucksters on the Montreal Market which had been previously carried on by the widow and her first husband. The second marriage was also subject to the regime de la communaut\u00e9 and was dissolved by the death of the wife in 1895, the property of the consorts being then of considerable value After receipt of a share of her mother's estate devised to her, the female plaintiff brought the present action, against her step-father and the children of the second marriage, asking for an account and demanding a share of the common property in virtue of a continuation of the community under the first marriage and consequent tripartite community between her, her deceased mother and the second husband The defences raised were (1) that there had been no continuation of community ; (2) that as continuation had not been demanded during the lifetime of the deceased consort there could be no tripartite community ; and (3) that the assets in possession of the consorts at the death of the first husband were insufficient to constitute an estate of which the law required an inventory to be made.\nThe action was maintained by the Superior Court, Doherty J., but on inscription in review this judgment was annulled Sir Melbourne Tait A. C. J. and Taschereau J., (Curran J. dissenting), on the ground that the demand for continuation of community ought to have been made during the lifetime of the consort who survived the first marriage and that the demand by the action came to late. On further appeal the Court of Queen's Bench reversed the judgment of the Court of Review and rendered the judgment from which the present appeal is asserted.\nMignault Q.C. and Beaudin Q.C. for the appellants. The plaintiff did not allege that her parents possessed assets which could have been comprised in legal community and the presumptions are that that community never possessed anything, that there was no community to be continued or of which it was possible for the surviving consort to make an inventory. It is impossible to infer from the want of such inventory, that the community continued. Lebrun Communaut\u00e9 ([3]) ; Pothier, Communaut\u00e9, nn. 778, 786, 787 ; Pearson v. Spooner ([4]) ; Dalloz Rep. vo. \"Scell\u00e9 et Inventaire,\" n. 1; art. 240 C. de P.; art. 1343 C. C. The surviving consort was not required by law to establish the absence of property by means of an official return proc\u00e8s-verbal de carence. The law imposing a penalty on the consort who neglects to make an inventory of the common property must be strictly construed. .As the first community possessed nothing the essential condition was wanting, and to require this to be shown by proc\u00e8s-verbal de carence would be to add to the law and impose a new obligation. The admission that there was no property-does away with the necessity of a proc\u00e8s-verbal de carence. Exacting a proc\u00e8s-verbal de carence where no property exists would be contrary to elementary principles of equity. See the Lurdonnois Case decided bv the Parlement de Paris, in 1731, Lebrun (2 ed.) 1754, p. 559, and recent decisions under art. 1442 C. N in the Cour d'Appel in France; S. V. '94, 2, 199; S. V. '95, 2, 30 ; Patrix v. Quesnel Jour, de P. '95 2 230. Compare also exceptions in cases of minors, (art. 311 C. C. and art. 472 C. N.) Dalloz, Rep. vo. \" Minorit\u00e9,\" no. 649 ; \" Cessante ratione, legis, cessai ipsa lex.\"\nThe continuation should have been demanded from the survivor and it is too late now after her death to make that demand upon her heirs. Continuation does not exist de plein droit, the demand to the survivor is essential consequently, during her life time. Arts. 240, 291 C. de P. ; art. 1323 C. C. (old text ; Pothier, Com. no. 800 ; Merlin, Rep. vo. \" Con. de Com.\" p. 177. The continuation is dissolved by death of the survivor ; art. 1335 C. C.; Morte socii solvitur societas. See also Bourassa v. Lacerte ([5]), per Sir L. N. Casault, C.J. at page 121 ; Beckett v. The Merchants Bank ([6]). Monk Q.C. and Pelletier for the respondents. The duty imposed upon the survivor existed from the time of the death of the deceased consort and corresponds to the right of the child to the continuation of community. Lamoignon, Arr\u00e9ts, lit, 33, art. 2 ; 2 Pr\u00e9vost de la Jann\u0141s, no. 374. To prevent the continuation of con munity, the survivor must make a formal inventory. 2 Argon Int. Liv. 3, chap. 5, pages 46, 47; Lebrun, Comm. Lib. 3, chap. 3, s. 1, n. 9, par. 1 .Pothier, Comm. nn. 772, 876 : art. 241 C. de P.; arts. 1323-11325 C. C. The law presumes the existence of common property in cases of community and it is consequently unnecessary to make proof of its existence, quantity or value. The omission to make the inventory leaves the survivor in reputed usurpation of the presumed property of the first community, small though it may be. She prevented dissolution taking effect, and voluntarily and deliberately submitted herself to the obligation as well as to the penalty of continuation of community. This presumption can be destroyed only by authentic proof in writing. Apart from that, property existed in a sufficiently appreciable proportion to give rise to the continuation. There was at the Lime of the marriage, a bed, bedding and some other small effects. The second husband admits having continued the business of the first husband, and no doubt made use of the instruments and tools of the first husband in his occupation as a gardener and dealer in garden produce. See Pothier, \"Comm.\" nn. 565, 771, 772, 784, 785, 800, 805, 876 ; Armour v Ramsay ([7]). The defence does not deny the existence of common property and the law can now only regard the confusion resulting from the omission of the inventory and apply the provisions of the Code. The cases cited by the appellants all involve special circumstances which distinguisi! them completely from the condition of facts in this action. See also Renusson, \" Communaut\u00e9,\" 3rd part., ch. 2, no. 42. The law regards the inventory as a quasi-judicial proceeding of the greatest importance and it cannot be omitted without incurring the penalty Art. 1323 et seq. C. C. (old text) ; arts. 1387 et seq. C. P. Q. The deceased consort and the defendant were defaulters and can claim no equitable rights in. face of their disregard of the law. This court should not disturb the findings of the courts below as to the fact of the existence of common property.\nThere has not been any decision in the Province of Quebec that a demand was necessary during the lifetime of the survivor the remarks of Sir L. N. Cassault in Bourassa v. Lacerte([8]) are merely obiter dicta. A valid demand can be made upon the survivor's representatives.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I entirely agree with Mr. Justice Girouard m the ground on which he places his judgment for the allowance of this appeal, namely, that it sufficiently appears that there was nothing to include in an inventory and, such being the case, the omission to make an inventory is not to be followed by the penal consequences imposed by the Code, viz., a continuation of community, but I think it right to say that I also agree with the reasons given by the majority of the Court of Review for their judgment. Those learned judges following the jurisprudence and especially the decision of Chief Justice Casault and the late Chief Justice Meredith in Bourassa v. Lacerte (1) held that the continuation of community must be demanded in the lifetime of the surviving spouse and that a demand of the heirs after the death of that survivor and at a time when a continued community would by the express provision of article 1335 C. C, if one had existed have been dissolved, is too late.\nThe appeal must he allowed with costs and the action dismissed with costs to the appellant in all the courts below.\nGwynne Sedgewick and King JJ. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal and dismissing the action. GIROUARD J. \u2014De droit commun, la continuation de\ncommunaut\u00e9 n'existe pas. Elle fut introduite en France en 1510 par l'article 118 de l'ancienne coutume de Paris et puis continu\u00e9e en 1580 par les articles 240 et 241 de la nouvelle coutume, qui devinrent le droit commun de la province de Quebec, reproduite au Code Civil art. 1323 et 1324. Il faut done l'entendre conform\u00e9ment aux termes de ces lois, sans en \u00e9tendre les dispositions \u00e0 ce qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu. Or le Code, comme la coutume, d\u00e9cr\u00e8te que, si le survivant des epoux\nmanque de faire proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'inventaire des biens communs, la communaut\u00e9 se continue, etc.\nIl faut done qu'il ait des biens communs et c'est aux parties qui invoquent la continuation . de communaut\u00e9 \u00e0 all\u00e9guer et prouver ce fait. C'est ce que les intim\u00e9s n'ont pas fait. Ils out cependant examine l'appelant qui a repondu que lors de son marriage ii n'avait rien,\nni elle non plus, seulement un lit, une couchette et quelques petites affaires.\nLes intim\u00e9s savaient si bien que telle \u00e9tait la situation de fait de la premiere communaut\u00e9 qu\u2019ils n'ont pas m\u00eame tent\u00e9 de faire la preuve par commune renomm\u00e9e.\nBien peu de commentateurs ont examine la question de savoir s'il fallait un proc\u00e8s-verbal de carence, lorsque la communaut\u00e9 n'avait rien on presque rien \u00e0 inventorier. Le Brun fut le premier \u00e0 l'exiger dans son Trait\u00e9 de la Communaut\u00e9, qui fut publi\u00e9 la premi\u0141re fois un an apr\u00e8s sa mort en 1709. La seconde edition parut en 1734 avec des additions, une, entr'autres, o\u00f9 est rapport\u00e9 un arr\u00eat du Parlement de Paris du 4 septembre, 1731, qui, sur un appel du Chatelet de Paris d\u00e9cida tout le contraire de la doctrine de LeBrun. L'annotateur observe Le Parlement de Paris a jug\u00e9 le contraire de la d\u00e9cision de M. LeBrun par arr\u00eat renduen la quatri\u00e8me chambre des Enqu\u00eates, le 4 septembre 1731. Quand on supposerait que les deux conjoints auraient eu quelque peu de meubles, c'est-\u00e0-dire, leurs hardes, cela ne pouvait valoir la peine, ni les frais d'un inventaire, ni payer le co\u00fbt d'un proc\u00e8s-verbal de carence, qui d'ailleurs n'est prescrit par aucune Ordonnance, ni par un arr\u00eat de r\u00e9glement.\nRenusson, un contemporain de LeBrun, adopee son sentiment dans son Trait\u00e9 de la Communaut\u00e9 se contentant d'observer que c'est l'opinion de LeBrun. Les derni\u00e8res editions de ses \u0153uvres constatent cependant qu'elle fut rejet\u00e9e par le Parlement de Paris par l'arr\u00eat de 1731, et que c'est le dernier mot de la jurisprudence. Egalement, Mesl\u00e9, un autre autorit\u00e9 sur Ia mati\u0141re, rapporte cette decision avec approbation sur le fondement de la notori\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vidente de la pauvrete de la communaut\u00e9\ncar, dit-il, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il n'y a point de bien, il ne peut y avoir ni communaut\u00e9 ni continuation de communaut\u00e9 (p. 645.)\nMais, disent les intim\u00e9s, ii r\u00e9sulte du t\u00e9moignage memo do l'appelant qu'il y avait des biens communs peu de choses, il est vrai, mais enfin quelque chose. Oui, quelques choses non appr\u00e9ciables \u00e0 prix d'arget un lit, des hardes de corps, et probablement quelques petits meubles de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 premi\u00e8re et exempts de saisie. L'inventaire de tels biens \u00e9chappe \u00e0 l'attention de la loi. De minimis non curat lex. Aussi Denizart vo. \"Carence,\" d\u00e9finit-il le proc\u00e8s-verbal de carence\nun acte qui se fait pour constater qu'un d\u00e9funt n'a rien laiss\u00e9 dans sa succession, ou n'a laiss\u00e9 que tr\u00e8s peu de choses.\nLos intim\u00e9s ont invoqu\u00e9 l'autorit\u00e9 de Pothier, \" Communaut\u00e9 \" n. 565 mais cet eminent jurisconsulte n'y entend pas parlor de la continuation de communaut\u00e9 mais simplement de la renonciation \u00e0 la com-muanut\u00e9 de Ia part de la femme qui n'a pas fait inventaire. Pothier ajoute qu'un acte de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 du 23 f\u00e9vrier 1708, atteste que dans ce cas ii ne suffit pas \u00e0 la veuve, pour se dispenser de rapporter un inventaire, de dire que son mani n'a laiss\u00e9, \u00e0 sa mort, aucuns effets, mais quelle dolt le justifier par un proc\u00e8s-Verbal de carence. L'on trouve cet acte de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 rapporte an long par Denizart, \" Actes de Notori\u00e9t\u00e9 \" p. 331 ; mais nulle part, Pothier enseigne que cette r\u00e9gle doit \u00e9galement \u00eatre suivie s'il s'agit de la continuation de communaut\u00e9. A ce sujet, ii garde le silence il ne cite ni LeBrun, ni l'arr\u00eat en 1731. Pas un arr\u00e9tiste, pas un commentateur n'enseigne que cet arr\u00eat ne fit pas autonite ; bien au contraire, ii est cite comme \u00e9tant la derni\u00e8re expression de l'ancienne jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise.\nEnfin la r\u00e8gle qu'il consacre a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e par les tribunaux et les jurisconsultes modernes dans des cas analogues ([9]).

After the seven years had expired the partners continued the business by verbal agreement for an indefinite period and while it so continued K. died.\nHeld, varying the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, that even if the parties had not admitted that the business was continued under the terms of the partnership deed such terms would still govern as there was nothing in the deed repugnant to a partnership at will; that the surviving partners had, therefore, a right to purchase the share of K. and to be allowed the deduction of 20 per cent therefrom as the deed provided ; and that in the absence of any stipulation in the deed to the contrary the goodwill of the business and K's interest therein should be taken into account in the valuation to be made for such purpose.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe appeal was brought on a special case agreed to by the parties which, omitting immaterial portions, was as follows : SPECIAL CASE STATED BY CONSENT FOR THE OPINION OF THE COURT, PURSUANT TO THE RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT, ORDER XXXIV.\n1. This action was commenced on the 13th day of December, 1898, by the plaintiff as executrix of Christian William August Kammerer, deceased, against Janet Parker Hibben, as executrix of Thomas Napier Hibben, deceased, and William Henry Bone, to have an account taken of the partnership dealings of the firm of T. N. Hibben & Co, and to have the affairs of the partnership wound up and for a receiver, and for a declaration that the proceedings purported to have been taken by the defendants under the deed of 1st August, 1884, for the purpose of determining the disputes between the parties are void as against the plaintiff, to the writ in which action the defendants appeared on the 15th December, 1898.\n2. By a deed of partnership dated the 1st day of August, 1884, Thomas Napier Hibben, the said Christian William August Kammerer (therein called Christian William Kammerer) and the said William Henry Bone agreed to become and remain partners in the business of wholesale and retail booksellers and stationers for the term of seven years from the date of the deed, if they should so long live, upon the terms set out in the deed.\n3. The deed is in the following terms :\n\"THIS INDENTURE made the first day of August, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-four, between Thomas Napier Hibben, of the City of Victoria, British Columbia, of the first part, Christian William Kammerer, of the same place, of the second part, and William Henry Bone, of the same place, of the third part: \" Whereas the said Thomas Napier Hibben has been carrying on business in the City of Victoria aforesaid under the style or firm name of \"T. N. Hibben & Co.\" as wholesale and retail bookseller and stationer up to the date hereof:\n\" And Whereas, the said Thomas Napier Hibben is (among other liabilities) indebted to the said Christian William Kammerer in the sum of $10,400.00, and is also indebted on the security of his stock in trade to the Needham Estate in the sum of $5,000.00, and is also indebted to one Thomas Sawdy Bone, on a certain promissory note dated the fifteenth day of July, 1884, in the sum of $1,500.00.\n\" And Whereas, it has been agreed between the parties hereto that in consideration of the said Christian William Kammerer releasing the said Thomas Napier Hibben from the said debt of $10,400.00, and in consideration of the said William Henry Bone paying off and discharging the said sum of $5,000.00 due on the said stock and taking up and cancelling the said note of $1,500.00, and paying in cash to the credit of the partnership intended to be hereby created the sum of $1,750.00, that the said Christian William Kammerer and William Henry Bone shall become and be partners and owners with the said Thomas Napier Hibben in the said business and in the lease or leases or tenancy of premises, stock, chattels and effects whatsoever now belonging to the said business or used and enjoyed in connection therewith, upon and subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter contained, the shares or interests of the parties to be in the proportions following, that is to say: The share of the said Thomas Napier Hibben to be 165\/538. The share of the said Christian William Kammerer to be 208\/538. The share of the said William Henry Bone to be 165\/538. The profits and losses to be received and paid in equal shares, and all liabilities of the said business to the date hereof (except those to be paid as aforesaid) to be paid by the parties in equal shares.\nNOW THIS INDENTURE WITNESSETH :\n\"1. That the said Thomas Napier Hibben, Christian William Kammerer and William Henry Bone will become and remain partners in the business aforesaid for the term of seven years from the date of these presents if they shall so long live.\n\"2. Nevertheless the partnership may be determined at any time during the term aforesaid by any of the partners who shall give to each of the others six months' notice in writing expiring on the last day of some month of the said term of his intention so to determine the said partnership. Any such notice shall be taken to be properly and personally served when the same shall be mailed within three days after the date thereof in a registered letter addressed to each of the partners at Victoria aforesaid in the post office at the said City of Victoria, and at the end of the six months mentioned in any such notice the said partnership and business shall be wound up as hereinafter mentioned.\n23. Within three months after the expiration of the partnership or at the expiration of any notice to be given as aforesaid (except in case of death of one of the partners) a general account shall be taken by the partners of all the capital, property, engagements and liabilities of the partnership, and immediately after such last mentioned account shall have been so taken and settled the partners then concerned shall make due provision for the payment of the debts and all other liabilities of the partnership and subject thereto all the property of the partnership shall be divided between the partners in the shares aforesaid and more particularly mentioned in clause eight hereof, and such instruments in writing shall be executed by the partners respectively for facilitating the getting in of the debts due to the partnership and for vesting the whole right in the said respective shares of the said property in the partner to whom the same shall respectively upon such division belong, and for releasing each to the others or other all claims on account of the partnership and otherwise as are usual in cases of a like nature: Provided always that any partner giving such notice as aforesaid shall before taking or disposing of his share in the partnership when ascertained as aforesaid to any other person or persons offer the same during the space of fourteen days for sale to the partner or partners not giving such notice the price to be paid for the share of any partner giving the notice aforesaid to be the ascertained value of his share at the time of taking such general account after deducting the proportion of liabilities, and if the said Christian William Kammerer shall give such notice he shall allow off the ascertained value of his shares after deduction of liabilities as aforesaid a discount of twenty per cent to the partner or partners desiring to purchase.\n\"24. If any partner shall die during the term of the partnership the survivors shall within six months after such death cause a general account to be taken in manner aforesaid and shall pay to the executors or administrators of the deceased partner the ascertained value subject to the terms and conditions of these presents of the share of the partner so dying. And if the said Christian William Kammerer shall die then the value of his share subject to the discount aforesaid, and the partnership hereby created shall cease and determine, or it shall be lawful for the survivors and the executors and administrators of any deceased partner or partners to carry on the partnership business subject to the terms and conditions hereof as if such death had not taken place, and the account of the deceased partner or partners shall be charged with the salary of a suitable person or persons to be selected by the survivor or survivors to perform the physical work which the deceased partner or partners should have performed if he or they had not so died, and if the business shall not be so carried on by the survivor or survivors and the respective executors or administrators of the deceased partner or partners, the survivor or survivors shall execute to the respective executors or administrators of the deceased partner or partners a good and sufficient bond or bonds of indemnity against all claims and demands whatsoever on account of the business of the debts, liabilities or engagements thereof. And further, it shall be lawful for the survivors of the partners, if the executors or administrators of a deceased partner shall not wish to carry on the business as aforesaid, or for the remaining partners after notice as aforesaid, if they or either of them purchase the interest of any deceased or retiring partner, to carry on the business under the like terms and conditions as herein contained to the end of the term hereinbefore mentioned, such intention to carry on the business to be signified by writing indorsed on these presents, and to be for the term aforesaid or for any extension thereof as may be mentioned in such indorsement. And the interests or shares of the partners so carrying on shall be the respective shares for the time being owned by the partners at the time of such death or withdrawal added to the interest or share or part thereof acquired by purchase from the executors or administrators of any deceased partner, or by purchase as aforesaid from any retiring partner.\"\n4. Prior to the execution of the said deed the said C. W. Kammerer and W. H. Bone had been for some years in the employ of the said T. N. Hibben, who had theretofore for many years carried on the business of a wholesale and retail bookseller and stationer, under the name and style of T. N. Hibben & Co.\n5. The shares of the respective partners in the property of the partnership were arrived at upon the basis of the value of the stock in trade and book debts belonging to the said business as compared with the amounts contributed by the said C. W. Kammerer and W. H. Bone, as recited in the said deed.\n6. In valuing the said stock in trade and book debts no allowance was made for the value of the good will.\n7. The said Thomas Napier Hibben died on the 12th January, 1890, having duly made his will whereof he appointed the said Janet Parker Hibben sole executrix, who duly proved the same in the Supreme Court of British Columbia on the 27th January, 1890.\n8. The said Thomas Napier Hibben, C. W. A. Kammerer and William Henry Bone carried on the business under the said partnership deed until the death of the said Thomas Napier Hibben, and thereafter the said Janet Parker Hibben and Christian William August Kammerer and William Henry Bone carried on the said business under the said partnership deed until the end of the said term.\n8a. After the expiration of the partnership term the said C. W. Kammerer, Janet Parker Hibben and W. H. Bone entered into a verbal agreement that the said partnership should continue on under the terms of the said deed, but the period of time during which the said partnership should continue was not fixed by the said agreement, and the said partnership was so carried on by the said persons until the death of the said C. W. Kammerer.\n9. From time to time during the continuance of the partnership a general account was taken under Article 19 of the said deed of all the capital, property, engagements and liabilities of the said partnership, and in taking the said accounts no regard was paid to the value of goodwill.\n10. The said Christian William August Kammerer duly made his will, and thereof appointed the plaintiff and James Kammerer Lewis executors, and thereby devised and bequeathed all his property, real and personal, to the plaintiff and the said James Kammerer Lewis absolutely, and the said James Kammerer Lewis in 1898 sold and assigned his interest in the said business of T. N. Hibben & Co., to the plaintiff absolutely.\nTHE QUESTIONS FOR THE OPINION OF THE COURT ARE:\n1. Whether the said Janet Parker Hibben and William Henry Bone are entitled as of right to buy the share of the said C. W. Kammerer under section 24 of the said deed.\n2. If the said Janet Parker Hibben and William Henry Bone have such right, whether they have the right to buy the said share by paying to the plaintiffs the value of that share in the said business (ascertained by an account as provided in the partnership deed) less a discount of twenty per cent, or in other woids, whether, if the said Janet Parker Hibben and William Henry Bone are entitled as of right to buy the share of the said Christian William August Kammerer in the said business, the plaintiff is not entitled to be paid the sum equal to 208\/538 of the value of the partnership property without any discount. 3. Whether the defendants are entitled to buy the share of the said Christian William August Kammerer, the plaintiff is entitled in valuing the share of the said Christian William August Kammerer to anything in respect to the goodwill of the said business.\nThe courts below decided, in favour of the plaintiffs, that defendants were not entitled to buy the share of the deceased partner, Kammerer, and that the plaintiffs were entitled to value the goodwill. The defendants appealed to this court.\nAylesworth Q.C. for the appellants.\nRiddell Q.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is a special case stated for the opinion of the Supreme Court of British Columbia pursuant to order 34 of the rules of that court. The opinion of the original court is by the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act expressly made the subject of appeal to this court.\nThe case was originally argued before Mr. Justice Drake, whose judgment was carried by way of appeal to the full court, which, after argument, expressed its opinion in favour of the present respondents. The facts which are fully set forth in the special case may be concisely stated as follows:\nBy deed dated the 1st of August, 1884, and made between Thomas Napier Hibben of the first part, Christian William Kammerer of the second part, and William Henry Bone of the third part, the same parties agreed to become partners in the business up to that time carried on by Mr. Hibben alone at Victoria, in British Columbia, of a wholesale and retail bookseller and stationer, and it was thereby agreed that the shares and interests of the parties were to be in the proportions following, namely, the share of Thomas Napier Hibben was to be 165\/538ths; the share of C. W. Kammerer was to be 208\/538ths, and the share of Bone was to 165\/538ths. The partnership was to be for the term of seven years determinable by six months notice during the term. The deed which is set forth in extenso contains minute recitals as to contributions of capital and other matters and precise and somewhat intricate covenants as to the carrying on of the business, and regarding the dissolution of the partnership and the division of the assets. Amongst other clauses it contained two, numbered respectively, 23 and 24, a difference of opinion as to the construction of which and their application in the events which have happened, has led to the present action. These clauses 23 and 24 are as follows :\n23. Within three months after the expiration of the partnership, or at the expiration of any notice to be given as aforesaid (except in case of death of one of the partners) a general account shall be taken by the partners of all the capital, property, engagements and liabilities of the partnership, and immediately after such last mentioned account shall have been so taken and settled the partners then concerned shall make due provision for the payment of the debts and all other liabilities of the partnership and subject thereto all the property of the partnership shall be divided between the partners in the shares aforesaid and more particularly mentioned in clause eight thereof, and such instruments in writing shall be executed by the partners respectively for facilitating the getting in of the debts due to the partnership, and for vesting the whole right in the said respective shares of the said property in the partner to whom the same shall respectively upon such division belong, and for releasing each to the others or other all claims on account of the partnership and otherwise as are usual in cases of a like nature : Provided always that any partner giving such notice as aforesaid shall before taking or disposing of his share in the partnership when ascertained as aforesaid to any other person or persons offer the same during the space of fourteen days for sale to the partner or partners not giving such notice, the price to be paid for the share of any partner giving the notice aforesaid to be the ascertained value of his share at the time of taking such general account after deducting the proportion of liabilities, and if the said Christian William Kammerer shall give such notice he shall allow off the ascertained value of his shares after deduction of liabilities as aforesaid a discount of twenty per cent to the partner or partners desiring to purchase.\n24. If any partner shall die during the term of the partnership the survivors shall within six months after such death cause a general account to be taken in manner aforesaid and shall pay to the executors or administrators of the deceased partner the ascertained value subject to the terms and conditions of these presents of the share of the partner so dying. And if the said Christian William Kammerer shall die then the value of his share subject to the discount aforesaid, and the partnership hereby created shall cease and determine, or it shall be lawful for the survivors and the executors or administrators of any deceased partner or partners to carry on the partnership business subject to the terms and conditions hereof as if such death had not taken place, and the account of the deceased partner or partners shall be charged with the salary of a suitable person or persons to be selected by the survivor or survivors to perform the physical work which the deceased partner or partners would have performed if he or they had not so died, and if the business shall not be so carried on by the survivor or survivors and the respective executors or administrators of the deceased partner or partners, the survivor or survivors shall execute to the respective executors or administrators of the deceased partner or partners a good and sufficient bond or bonds of indemnity against all claims and demands whatsoever on account of the business of the debts, liabilities or engagements thereof. And further, it shall be lawful for the survivors of the partners, if the executors or administrators of a deceased partner shall not wish to carry on the business as aforesaid, or for the remaining partners after notice as aforesaid, if they or either of them purchase the interest of any deceased or retiring partner to carry on the business under the like terms and conditions as herein contained to the end of the term hereinbefore mentioned, such intention to carry on the business to be signified by writing indorsed on these presents, and to be for the term aforesaid or for any extension thereof as may be mentioned in such indorsement. And the interests or shares of the partners so carrying on shall be the respective shares for the time being owned by the partners at the time of such death or withdrawal added to the interest, or share or part thereof acquired by purchase from the executors or administrators of any deceased partner, or by purchase as aforesaid from any retiring partner.\nThe partners, Hibben, Kammerer and Bone carried on the business under the articles of partnership until the death of Hibben, on the 12th of January, 1890. Thenceforward the business was carried on under the articles by the executrix of Hibben, the present appellant, Janet Parker Hibben and the surviving partners Kammerer and Bone up to the expiration of the term of seven years.\nSubsequently to the expiration of the original partnership term the business was carried on by Mrs. Hibben, Kammerer and Bone up to the death of Kammerer, at a date not specified in the case, as a partnership at will.\nThe special case contains the following paragraph relative to the terms on which this last mentioned partnership business was carried on, viz. :\n8a. After the expiration of the partnership term the said C. W. Kammerer, Janet Parker Hibben and W. H. Bone entered into a verbal agreement that the said partnership should continue on under the terms of the said deed, but the period of the time during which the said partnership should continue was not fixed by the said agreement, and the said partnership was so carried on by the said persons until the death of the said C. W. Kammerer.\nUpon the death of Kammerer the other partners Mrs. Hibben and Bone resolved to continue the business exercising the power conferred upon them by section 24, that is, they gave to Kammerer's executors the notice provided for by section 24 (called therein the notice under clause two) that they would purchase Kammerer's share. Their right to do so having been contested by Kammerer's representatives, the question submitted by the special case as to the proper construction of clause 24 and its applicability under the circumstances stated was raised.\nThat clause 24 was applicable the parties themselves expressly admit when they say in the words of paragraph 8a. of the special case that the partnership at will was carried on under the \" terms of the said deed.\" Without this admission however the result would have been the same, since there was nothing repugnant to a partnership at will in the provision as to the purchase of Kammerer's share in case of his death, and a prolongation of a partnership business at will by surviving partners and representatives of a deceased partner is in the absence of express agreement always presumed to be in the terms of the original partnership so long as these terms are not inconsistent with a partnership at will. Authorities need not be cited for so plain a proposition of law.\nThen the question arises whether the deduction of twenty per cent is to be made from the valuation of Kammerer's share. I see no reason why the appellants should not have the benefit of that reduction. According to the plain meaning of paragraph 8a it must be now assumed by the court that the last partnership was expressly carried on on these terms, and I am at a loss to find ground for refusing to give effect to it. I have heard no good ground assigned in argument and I am of opinion that none can be propounded.\nLastly the respondents who are the executors of Kammerer insist that they are entitled to have the goodwill of the business and Kammerer's interest in it taken into account in the valuation to be made for the purposes of the purchase of Kammerer's share. The goodwill is one of the partnership assets and most certainly ought to be taken into account in valuing the business and assets. The case of Steuart v. Gladstone[1] relied on as an authority for the appellants is clearly not applicable ; in that case there was an agreement to pay a retiring partner the value of his share as shown by the last annual account. It was held that this did not entitle the partner retiring to have the goodwill included as it was not included in but rightly omitted from the last annual account. Thus by the clearly expressed terms of the agreement it was excluded. There is nothing of this kind in the present case.\nThe questions submitted for the opinion of the court in the special case are as follows, viz. :\n1. Whether the said Janet Parker Hibben and William Henry Bone are entitled as of right to buy the share of the said C. W. Kammerer under section 24 of the said deed.\n2. If the said Janet Parker Hibben and William Henry Bone have such right, whether they have the right to buy the said share by paying to the plaintiffs the value of that share in the said business (ascertained by an account as provided in the partnership deed) less a discount of twenty per cent, or in other words, whether, if the said Janet Parker Hibben and William Henry Bone are entitled as of right to buy the share of the said Christian William August Kammerer in the said business, the plaintiff is not entitled to be paid a sum equal to 208\/538ths of the value of the partnership property without any discount.\n3. Whether if the defendants are enitled to buy the share of the said Christian William August Kammerer, the plaintiff is entitled in valuing the share of the said Christian William August Kammerer to anything in respect to the goodwill of the said business.\nThese questions must in accordance with the foregoing opinion be formally answered as follows :\n(1) The said Janet Parker Hibben and William Henry Bone are entitled as of right to buy the share of the said C. W. A. Kammerer under clause 24 of the said deed.\n(2) The said Janet Parker Hibben and William Henry Bone having the right to buy the share of O. W. A. Kammerer, the value of that share is to be ascertained by an account as provided in the partnership deed, and the said parties so purchasing the share are entitled to a deduction or discount of twenty per cent from the value of the share so ascertained.\n(3) If the appellants (defendants below) elect to exercise their right of purchasing Kammerer's share the respondents are entitled to have allowed to them in taking the accounts for ascertaining the value of the share, his proportion or share of the goodwill of the business, to be valued as a partnership asset.\nThere must be no costs of this appeal. The appellants succeed on the two first questions submitted, but they fail on the third the important question as to the goodwill.\nAn order is to be drawn up stating the formal answers as above which with the record is to be transmitted to the Supreme Court of British Columbia.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: James H. Lawson, Jr.\nSolicitor for the respondents: A. P. Luxton.\n[1] 10 Ch. D. 626.\n",

The consignee failed to take delivery in accordance with the specific terms of the bills of lading and was in default. Arts. 1067, 1069 C. C. When the goods were delivered over the rail from the ship's deck and placed upon the dock the ship was discharged under the bills of lading and the goods remained there at the risk of the consignee. R. S. C. chap. 90 ; art. 2430 C. C. There is no proof of a prevailing custom supported by the general practice of the port Cunningham v Fonbianque ([1]) ; Svendson v. Wallace ([2]). Custom cannot be read into the contract if it be inconsistent with or repugnant to the terms of the bills of lading. Humphrey v. Dale ([3]), remarks of Lord Campbell at page 141 ; Yates v. Pym. ([4]) ; Hutchinson v. Tatham ([5]) ; Tucker v. Linger ([6]) ; Perry v. Barnett ([7]). Here there is nothing doubtful as to the terms of the contract and it must prevail; Bowes v. Shand ([8]); Petrocochino v. Bolt ([9]) The ship delivered all the cargo called for by the bills of lading according to the terms and conditions thereof ; there is no evidence of shortage, loss or damage to that portion of the cargo which belonged to the plaintiff, and if he suffered it was through his own fault in his breach of the terms of the contract of carriage.\nMacmaster Q.C. and F. S. Maclennan Q.C, for the respondent. The pleadings admit the shortages established by the evidence and correspondence filed; on this the courts below based their findings of fact which should not now be interfered with.

The Queen ([14]); Bickford v. Hawkins ([15]); Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Rainville ([16]).\nThe respondent was not notified to be ready to receive the goods from the ship's side, nor did the defendants expect or intend to make delivery from the ship's side on the wharf. They have not so pleaded, nor proved that they so notified plaintiff. Plaintiff was not bound to be ready to receive the goods nor: in default until after notice, and the provisions in the bill of lading authorizing entry at the Custom House, landing and warehousing at the risk of the consignee can not be invoked Bourne v Gatliffe ([17]) ; Golden v. Manning ([18]); Duff v: Budd ([19]) ; Garnett v. Willan ([20]); arts. 2429 2430 C. C. Juson v. Aylward ([21]); Richardson v. Goddard ([22]); The Eddy ([23]). Delivery according to the custom of the port was contemplated when the bills of lading were issued and must be implied though not expressed in terms. The stipulations as to mode of delivery must be construed as made with reference to the custom of the port of discharge and the usage governing the particular trade. Postlethwaite v. FreeIand ([24]) per Blackburn L. J. at p. 613; 1 Pritchard's Adm. Dig. (3 ed.) p. 477, no. 36 ; McLaughlin's Merchant Shipping; (3 ed.) p. 384; Meyerstein v. Barber ([25]). The manner of delivery and period at which the responsibility of the ship ceases depends upon the custom of particular places and the usage of particular trades. In Petrocochino v. Bott ([26]) deliveiy was not direct from the ship. See Cairns v. Robins ([27]) per Abinger, 0, B. at p. 262; Wright v. London & North Western Railway Co, ([28]) The bills of lading did not exempt from liability for deficiencies in the packages. We refer to arts. 1674 1675 1676 C. C. as to carriers' liability.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting.)\u2014I am unable to agree with the conclusion at which the other members of the court have arrived.\nIt appears to me that there is no error in the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench and adhering to the reasons given in the judgment of Mr. Justice Blanchet, I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nSedgewick J. The appellants are the owners of\nthe steamship Ph\u0153nix. In April 1894, this vessel made a voyage from two Mediterranean ports Cat\u00e9nia and Messina, to Montreal, with a cargo of fruit. Bills of lading were issued in the regular course and the plaintiff was the holder of the great majority of them, representing 29,359 boxes of lemons and oranges.\nThe Phoenix arrived in Montreal on the 27th of April, 1894, and immediately commenced to discharge her cargo, by landing the fruit upon the wharf. These goods were not immediately taken away by the consignees but were allowed to remain upon the wharf or in sheds by Carbray, Routh & Co., the ship's agents, until they were sold on the 2nd of May following at public auction. The delivery to the auction purchasers occupied several days. After these auction purchasers had claimed their goods the respondent complained that there was a large shortage in the quantities to which he was entitled and that the ship-owners, their officers and servants, had allowed a large number of boxes while on the wharf or in the shed to be broken and their contents abstracted, and also that there was a failure to deliver certain other boxes according to their marks and numbers and this action was brought to recover the amount of these damages.\nThe only authority which Messrs. Carbray, Routh & Co. had to act as ship's agents upon the arrival of the Ph\u0153nix is contained in the following letter written by the appellants :\nDear Sirs,\u2014We beg to advise you that our SS. Phoenix left Messina on the 31st ult. with a cargo of fruit for Montreal consigned to your address. The object of the present is to say, will you kindly render Captain Pick all necessary assistance he may require. We hope the cargo will be delivered in first class order and that no claim may arise. We rely upon your goodselves to keep down expenses to the lowest possible point in these very bad times, as well you know. We have about \u00a31,166 balance of freight to receive, will you please therefore disburse the ship inward and outward of it and let us have the balance and accounts as early as you can.\nThe Ph\u0153nix is chartered with Messrs. Richard R. Dobell & Co. at Londnn, from Montreal to Dundee and, as we are quite free for stevedoring outward please get this done at the lowest current price consistent with good reliable stevedore Messrs Peter Ferns & Son have been named to us as good people in this department We trust the Ph\u0153nix will receive good despatch on both cargoes ; in the meantime we shall be pleased to hear from you.\nWe are, dear sirs, yours faithfully,\nPARSONS & LINTON.\nWe are writing Captain Pick to your address.\nNinety-four bills of lading were given by the master all of which, were in the same terms. Among other stipulations therein were the following :\nShipped\u2014(148) one hundred and forty-eight boxes lemons said to be marked and numbered as per margin and to be delivered from the ship's deck, where the ship's responsibility shall cease.\nSimultaneously with the ship being ready to unload the above mentioned goods, or any part thereof, the consignee of the said goods is hereby bound to be ready to receive the same from the ship's side, either on the wharf or quay at which the ship may lie for discharge or into lighters provided with a sufficient number of men to receive and stow the said goods therein and in default thereof, the master or agent of the ship and the collector of the port of discharge are hereby authorised to enter the said goods at the Custom House and land, warehouse or place them in lighter without notice to and at the risk and expense of the said consignee of the goods after they leave the deck of the ship.\nWILLIAM A. PICK,\nMaster.\nThe declaration of the respondent contained the following statements :\n4. The said steamer Ph\u0153nix during the said voyage had on board as part of her cargo 25,259 boxes of lemons and oranges and 4,100 half-boxes of oranges and lemons consigned to and the property of the said plaintiff which the master of the said steamer acknowledged to have received in food order and condition at Messina and Catania aforesaid and for which the said master issued bills of lading which were duly indorsed and delivered to the said plaintiff.\n5. On the arrival of the said steamer Ph\u0153nix in Montreal the said cargo was discharged and unloaded from the steamer by the defendants and their agents in Montreal, Messrs. Carbray, Routh & Co., and placed upon the wharf and dock alongside the said steamer, and the defendants through their agents, took full charge and control of the said cargo during its discharge and after it had been placed upon the wharf as aforesaid It was proved at the trial that all the goods which had been taken on board the ship in the Mediterranean ports were delivered at the wharf at Montreal and I think, these two paragraphs of the declaration show that the claim is not for any loss occurring during the voyage, but for loss wholly occurring subsequent thereto, and the evidence was altogether with a view of proving that damage, and the principal question in issue, in this case is as to whether or not the ship-owners are liable therefor. I am opinion that they are not, for the following reasons :\nPrim\u00e2 facie, the responsibility of the owner to the consignee of the goods shipped depends upon the terms of the bill of lading. The bills of lading in this case provide that when the goods are delivered from the ship's deck the ship's responsibility shall cease, and further that, simultaneously with the ship being ready to unload, the consignee is bound to be ready to receive the same from the ship's side either on the wharf or quay at which the ship may lie for discharge.\nThese goods were delivered from the ship's deck. They were unloaded on the wharf and thereupon the consignees were bound to be ready to receive them. The shipper's responsibility wholly ceased ; they were from that moment at the risk wholly of the consignees. Any arrangements for the disposal or warehousing or holding of the cargo after delivery in order to bind the appellants, must be made either with them personally or with agents authorised by them specially for that purpose. The appellants themselves made no such arrangement and, as the power of the ship's agents was set out in the letter to Carbray Routh & Co; above set out and did not either directly or indirectly authorise them to constitute the ship-owners warehousemen on behalf of the consignees there was no authority anywhere on the part of the ship's agents to deviate in the slightest degree from the terms of the bills of lading. If they did make arrangements in regard to the custody of the goods after delivery on the wharf, they and not the ship-owners must be responsible for any loss subsequently occurring.\nIt was argued by counsel for the respondent that the parties here did not intend to make a delivery in accordance with the bills of lading, and that it was competent for them to adopt a delivery in accordance with an alleged custom prevailing at the port of Montreal in respect to fruit charges. There is no evidence to show that the ship-owners at least, had any intention of departing in the manner of delivery from the delivery mentioned in the bills of lading nor do I think that any custom was proved. It doubtless is true that in the case of a few vessels previously arriving in Montreal laden with fruit, the fruit was disposed of precisely as in the present case, but, for all we know, the course adopted in those cases may have been the result of special arrangements made in respect to each particular case. But there is no complete or satisfactory evidence that such a custom existed in such a manner as to be known to the trade generally and known to foreign ship-owners. The evidence must be such as to lead to the conviction that a custom in order to be binding upon the whole world, must be known, speaking largely, to all persons whose interest it would be to know of its existence.\nBut even supposing there was a custom, the terms of the bills of lading being inconsistent with and repugnant to the custom they must prevail against the custom. The contention of the respondent is that in order to know the full and complete contract between the parties there should be added to the bills of lading the following words, as suggested by the appellant's factum :\nThe ship agrees, after discharging the goods, to check and sort them upon the dock or wharf, to appoint a sufficient number of men day and night to care for them and to protect them from deterioration loss or theft until the consignee shall have been able to sell the said goods and then make delivery to the different purchasers upon the orders of the consignees after the said purchasers have had an opportunity of inspecting the said goods upon the wharf or quay.\nI do not think it possible that such an agreement was ever contemplated by the parties. The very fact, as Mr. Justice Lynch in his judgment in the Superior Court suggests, that such a custom would be most unjust leads to the conclusion that it was no custom at all or at all events a custom not binding upon the world.\nIt is not necessary, taking this view of the case, that we should place liability anywhere. Our duty is done when we have determined that in the present case, it does not rest upon the owners of the ship\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the action dismissed, the appellants having their costs in all the courts below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants Atwater & Duclos.\nSolicitor for the respondent : Macmaster, Maclennan & Hichkson.\n[1] 6 C. & P. 44.\n[2] 46 L.

Gregory (24 Can. S. C. R. 661) followed; and the money demand in the declaration being only incidental to the main cause of action could not give the court jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\nMOTION to quash an appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe grounds on which the motion was based are sufficiently indicated in the above head-note and in the judgment of the court.\nStuart Q.C. for the motion. There can be no appeal to this court from the judgment in an action en s\u00e9paration de corps; O'Dell v. Gregory ([1]); and the money demand, the granting of which is a necessary consequence of the decree for separation; Art. 208 et seo. C. C.; cannot confer jurisdiction. See also Ontario & Quebec Railway Co. v. Marcheterre ([2]) ; McDonald v. Galivan ([3]) ; 5 Aubry et Ran p. 282.\nFitzpatrick Q. C. Sol. Gen. of Canada, contra. The plaintiff demands by her declaration a sum of $18,000 which, by sec. 29, subsec. 4 of the Supreme Court Act fixes the amount in dispute on this appeal at that sum and gives jurisdiction to the court to hear it. Laberge v. Equitable Life Assurance Society. ([4]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is a motion to quash an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench affirming a judgment of the Superior Court, whereby in an action for s\u00e9paration de corps instituted by the present respondent against her husband, the present appellant, the latter court decreed separation.\nThe action of the respondent is founded on allegations of cruel and unlawful treatment and the conclusion taken is in the usual form for separation from bed and board which of course is the principal relief sought the other heads which include amongst several others a condemnation to pay $18,000 money of the respondent alleged to have come to the hands of the appellant, all being dependent upon and subordinate and incidental to the principal head, the separation from bed and board. The appeal therefore, if admitted, would necessarily involve a discussion as to the sufficiency of the evidence and the grounds for the adjudication on the question of separation. The judgment as to the incidental matters would follow as of course the decision of the court upon the main question involved in the action which this court would therefore be compelled to deal with primarily, irrespective altogether of any matters in dispute as to the pecuniary or other consequential rights between the parties.\nIn the case of (O'Dell v. Gregory ([5]) this court has already determined that an action for separation is not within its competence, the statute to which the jurisdiction here must always be referred not having provided for an appeal in this class of cases. If we were to hold that the mere addition to the conclusion of a claim for relief, in respect of a money demand consequent upon and incidental to a judgment for the plaintiff, could give this court jurisdiction, the want of jurisdiction which we must presume was withheld by the legislature for some good reason, would be rendered illusory and the rule formulated in O'Dell v. Gregory (1) would be evaded.\nWe are all of opinion that the motion to quash must be granted.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fitzpatrick, Parent, Taschereau & Roy.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Caron, Pentland & Stuart.\n[1] 24 Can.

The Midland Railway Co, v. Gribble ([\"1895] 2 Ch. 827) and The Canada Southern Railway Go. v. Clouse (13 Can. S. C. R. 139) referred to.\nThe provincial legislatures in Canada have no jurisdiction to make regulations in respect to crossings or the structural condition of the roadbed of railways subject to the provisions of \"The Railway Act\" of Canada. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. The Corporation of the Parish of Notre-Dame de Bonsecour's ( [1899] A. C. 367), followed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at the City of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec which maintained the plaintiff's action with costs. A statement of the case and of the questions at issue upon this appeal appears in the judgments reported.\nStuart Q.C. for the appellant. The plaintiff's land is not crossed by the railway, but merely adjoins the railway lands which form its southern boundary; therefore sec. 191 of \"The Railway Act\" of Canada does not apply.\nThe special acts in respect to the incorporation of the Grand Trunk Railway Company and its powers give no greater rights to crossings than the general Act of the Dominion Parliament, and even if the Provincial Act in Quebec can be said to be more favourable to the plaintiff's pretentions, it cannot affect questions in respect to the road-bed or construction of any railway subject to the Dominion Act.\nThis action is not based upon articles 540, 541 C.C., but claims, without offering indemnity, a right of a statutory nature, and we contend that no such right exists. We rely also upon our deed of the lands and the release therein by Ross who was fully indemnified and made no reservations when the right of way was originally conveyed to the company.\nWe also cite the following cases: The Grand Trunk Railway Go. v. Campbell ([1]); The Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Vogel ([2]), which has not been impugned on the point now in question; The Grand Trunk Railway Ca. v. Huard ([3]); The Canada Southern Railway Co. v. Clouse ([4]); Roy v Beaulieu ([5]); Veina v. The Queen-([6]) and R. S. C ch. 1, and sec. 7, sub-sec. 51.\nFitzpatrick Q.C, (Solicitor-General), and L. A. Taschereau for the respondent. The Railway Acts must be read as aided by Articles 540-5 44 C. C., and give respondent the necessary right of way from his lands across the railway as the only direct means of ' reaching the nearest and only public road which lies on the other side of the railway and runs parallel to it. This is his only exit to his only highway and refusal of the necessary servitude is a hardship for which both the general statutes and the Civil Code provide a remedy.\nThe appellant company is governed also by 16 Vict. ch 37 which by its second section incorporates the clauses of the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act (14 & 15 Vict. ch. 51) with respect to the first, second, third and fourth clauses thereof and also with respect to interpretation, highways, bridges, fences and general provisions. Section 13 of that Act provides that \"fences shall be erected and maintained on each side of the railway * * * with openings, or gates, or bars therein, and farm crossings on the road, for the use of the proprietors of the lands adjoining the railway.\" It is clear that crossings are too he provided and maintained not only for the use of the proprietors whose lands are cut or separated in two by the railway but also for the use of all lands adjoining railways.\nArt. 5171 clauses 1 and 2 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, by similar provisions, requires farm crossings to be made and maintained by the company, upon the application of any proprietor of such land, present or future. This provision of the provincial statute is quite intra vires, and applicable notwithstanding that the Grand Trunk is a federal railway See remarks by Mr. Justice Plamandon ([7]) in reference to the case of Gagn\u00e9 v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.; Art. 6 C. C.; C. S. C. ch. 66 sec. 13; R. S. C. ch. 109, sec 54. In this instance the appellant is clearly bound by its special Act to furnish the respondent with the required crossing. The Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Huard ([8]), per Plamondon J. in the Superior Court and Boss\u00e9 J. in Appeal.\nThe respondent has priority by Art. 2085 C. C. over the conveyance and release by Ross to the company which, although executed in the year 1856, was not registered until 13th June, 1899, and the respondent had no notice of the deed or its contents when he obtained and registered his title.\nTASCHEREAU J in 1856, the Grand Trunk Railway Company, present appellants, purchased from Arthur Ross the strip of land, many miles in length, required for their road across the Seignior of Beau-rivage then in a state of wilderness, for 'the sum of two hundred and fifty pounds,\nbeing in full for the price and value of the said piece or parcel of ground as well as the amount of th\u00e8 compensation allowed to the said party of the first part for damages suffered by him by reason of the taking of the said piece or parcel of ground, cutting his property, and all other damages generally whatsoever.\nThe company then, or very soon after, built their line on the land they had so acquired.\nSubsequently, Ross got his Seigniory surveyed and subdivided into concessions and lots; and in 1885, one O'Brien whose title from Ross is not in evidence, sold two lots thereof, Nos. 74 and 75, in the first concession of the then newly erected Parish of St. Agapit, in the said Seigniory, containing three arpents each by thirty, bounded in front on the south by the said railway to one Sifroid Therrien, who, soon thereafter, entered into possession and built a house on lot 74. A public road was then in existence parallel to the rail-way line south of it and immediately adjoining it, the railway line thus separating the two lots in question from the said public road. The company, however, gave to Sifroid Therrien a crossing over their line on lot 74 to give him access to the road. Later Sifroid Therrien assigned lot 74 to one of his sons, named Telephone, and subsequently, in 1898, lot 75 to another one of his sons named Joseph, the present respondent, who by this action claims the right to have! a crossing on the company's line so as to have access to the public road, as his brother has on lot 74. His claim is not for a right of way at common law (Art. 540 C.C.) but for a statutory crossing.\nI do not see how his claim can be supported. The railway is not built across his land. He has no land on the south of the railway line. It is the railway property that is his boundary, and the statute which provides that every company shall make crossings for persons across whose land the railway is carried, has no application. 51 Vict. ch. 29, sec. 191. The Canada Southern Railway Co. v. Clouse ([9]). Then Ross has received compensation from the company for the severance of his property and all damages resulting from the construction of the railway. He sold this land without reserving a right of way across the company's road. Those who hold under him, as the respondent does cannot have more rights than Ross would have under the same circumstances were that lot 75 still in his hands.\nBefore the public road was located, the owner of this lot 75, having no land on the other side of the railway, had no right of exit across the railway line. I do not see that the location of the road has given him any rights that he did not have previously, any more than the building of a church, or of a store, or of a public building of any kind, would have done. The respondent may or may not have the right at common law to get an access to the public road over the company's line at his own cost but he certainly has not got the statutory right at the company's cost that he claims by his action.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs and the action dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J. - The plaintiff claims that he is entitled by law to a crossing over the railway of the defendant company, not because of any grant from the company to him or his predecessors in title, but on the ground that the statute imposes such an obligation on the company.\nThe plaintiff owns a parcel of land known as lot 75 on one side of and adjoining the strip of land used by the defendant company for its tracks and right of way, but he owns no land on the other side. If the rights of the parties are governed by the general railway law of Canada, the fact that the plaintiff owns land only on one side of the railway is fatal to his claim.\nThe company obtained title to this strip of land on which its railway is now constructed and operated, by a conveyance from one Arthur Ross, more than forty years ago. This conveyance recites that the company\nhaving followed and complied with all the provisions of the statutes in force in the Province of Canada relating to railways are entitled to take possession of the land described in the conveyance.\nThe plaintiff's father owned the land now in question, and other land, all adjoining the railway on the north side and for some years before the grant to his son used a crossing of the railway tracks starting from the portion of his land which has not been conveyed to the plaintiff, thence across the railway tracks to a public highway. The portion conveyed to and now owned by the son never had from it any crossing over the railway. '\nThere is no evidence as to how the plaintiffs father got the right to use his crossing, and it is not material to the consideration of this case because it is not argued that the plaintiff's right depends in any way upon the right of the father to cross the railway tracks at the old crossing; the plaintiff's right is admitted to depend on the liability of the railway company to make a farm crossing under some statute law.\nThe present general railway Act passed in 1888 enacts in section 191:\nEvery company shall make crossings for persons across whose lands the railway is carried, convenient and proper for the crossing of the railway by farmers' implements carts and other vehicles.\nThe plaintiff became the owner of the land in question on the 27th of September 1898, subsequent to the passing of the Railway Act of 1888.\nThis enactment in the Railway Act declares the liability of the railway company to make crossings for parties across whose land the railway is carried, and therefore it does not apply to any one whose land is not crossed by the railway.\nThe English Railways Clauses Consolidation Act of 1845 contains a similar provision; the language is:\nThe company shall make and at all times thereafter maintain the following works for the accommodation of the owners and occupiers of land adjoining the railway that is to say such convenient gates and passages over the railway as shall be necessary for the purpose of making good any interruptions caused by the railway to the use of the lands through which the railway shall be made ; and such works shall be made forthwith after the part of the railway passing over such lands shall have been laid out or formed, or during the formation thereof.\nThat this provision is intended to apply only to a person who owns parcels of land on opposite sides of and adjoining each side of the railway, is shown in the case of The Midland Railway Co. v. Gribble ([10]). In that case the judgment of the court was in effect that a crossing of a railway reserved for a person through those land the railway had been constructed was an easement enjoyable only so long as that person owned land on both sides of the railway, and goes so far as to declare that this easement would be lost as soon as he parted with his land on either side of the railway and would not be restored even if he should repurchase that parcel so as to become again an owner of land on both sides of the railway y in other words, it is confined to the person across whose land the rail-way is carried in the first place and under certain circumstances to his heirs and assigns, and continues only so long as he or they own land on both sides of the railway.\nThere has been some \u00a1argument on the part of the plaintiff based on the theory that the Provincial Act of the Province of Quebec governs the rights of the parties in this case. That theory is no longer arguable. In the case of The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. The Corporation of the Parish of Notre-Dame de Bonse-cours ([11]) the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, while deciding that a Dominion railway company might be under the jurisdiction of the provincial legislature so far as to require it to clean out the silt which accumulated in one of the existing ditches and which caused water to flow back upon the lands of adjoining owners, declared in effect that provincial legislation would be ultra vires if it directed the structural condition of the road bed or crossing of its tracks to be altered.\nThe plaintiff also argues that even if the \u201cRailway Act\" of Canada compelled a railway company to build crossings only for the use of those whose farms are cut in two, still the Grand Trunk Railway Company is governed by a special Act which provides for this particular case and makes the general Act inapplicable.\nThis defendant company was incorporated by 16 Vict. ch. 37. Section 2 of that Act declares that the several clauses of the Railway Consolidation Act shall be incorporated in that Act of incorporation, and a later Act namely 18 Vict. ch. 33 in its fourth section declares that the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act shall extend and be applicable to the Grand Trunk Railway Company.\nThe Railway Clauses Consolidation Act 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 51, deals with fences etc in its thirteenth clause which enacts that fences should be erected and maintained on each side of the railway with openings, or gates or bars and farm crossings of the road for the use of the proprietors of the lands adjoining the railway. In a subsequent Consolidated Railway Act, after Confederation, namely, 42 Vict. ch. 9, (D.) section 16 deals with this same subject enacting in effect that a railway company (if so required) should erect and maintain, on each side of the railway fences of the strength and height of an ordinary division fence with sliding gates, commonly called hurdle gates, with proper fastenings at farm crossings of the road for the use of the proprietors of the land adjoining the railway.\nIt was held in The, Canada Southern Railway Co v Clouse ([12]) that the substitution of the word \" at\" in the later Act was merely the correction of an error and was made to render more apparent the meaning of The Railway Clauses Consolidation Act and there* fore it is to be now interpreted as if the railway company was liable to erect and maintain fences with openings, or gates, or bars therein at farm crossings of the road, without attempting to describe when, or where, or upon what occasion the railway company should be obliged to provide a farm crossing ; consequently there is no statutory direction prescribing a liability of the railway company to make a farm crossing under the circumstance contended for now by the plaintiff ; in other words, there is no difference in the effect of the statute known as \" The Railway Clauses Consolidation Act and the general Railway Act of 1888 now in force.\nThe result is that there is no statutory liability on the part of the appellant to supply such a crossing as the plaintiff desires, he having land only on one side of the railway.\nIt is not necessary in this case to discuss the question as to how far or under what circumstances the person whose land was originally crossed by the railway can transfer his rights to a third party.\nKing and Girouard JJ.

In every case there must be apparent water which is caused to flow by an artificial channel from the lands to be assessed into the drainage work or upon other lands to their injury which water is to be carried off by the proposed drainage work.\nAssessment for \u201cbenefit\u201d under the Act must have reference to the additional facilities afforded by the proposed drainage work for the drainage of all lands within the area of the proposed work, and may vary according to difference of elevation of the respective lots, the quantity of water to be drained from each, their distances from the work and other like circumstances.\nSection 75 of that Act only authorises an assessment for repair and maintenance of an artificially constructed drain. The cost of widening and deepening a natural watercourse for the purpose of draining lands is not assessable upon particular lands under said section 75 but must constitute a charge upon the general funds of the municipality.\nIn the present case, the scheme proposed was mainly for the reclamation of drowned lands in a township on a lower level than that of the initiating municipality, and such works are not drainage works within the meaning of said section 75 for which assessments can be levied thereunder, nor are they works by which the lands in the higher township can be said to have been benefited.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson at the trial which dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs.\nThe action was to set aside a by-law, (no. 601,) of the Township of Romney, and the report and proceedings on which it was based whereby certain wild lands, situate in that township, were assessed for \u201coutlet\u201d and \u201cinjuring\u201d liability in respect to lands in the adjoining Township of Tilbury North, and for repairs to certain drainage works and improvement of streams and dykes constructed in connection therewith in the Township of Tilbury North; and also to set aside another by-law, (no. 602,) of the Township of Romney, assessing said lands for outlet charges and maintenance of other drains in the Township of Romney, and to have both by\u2011laws declared ultra vires of the Corporation of the Township of Romney.\nA statement of the circumstances under which the action was taken and the questions at issue upon this appeal will be found in the judgment of the court delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Gwynne. Atkinson Q.C. and M. Wilson Q.C. for the appellant. Actions similar to this have frequently been before the Ontario courts. See Sweeney v. The Corporation of Smith\u2019s Falls[2]; Broughton v. Townships of Grey and Elma[3].\nWest Tilbury was not bound to keep these drains in repair and lands in Romney could not therefore be assessed for the cost of repairs. Re Township of Mersea and Township of Rochester[4].\nAs to the powers of the municipality under sec. 75 of 57 Vict. ch. 56, see In re Stonehouse and Plympton[5], and as to \u201cinjuring liability\u201d, Scott v. Town of Peterborough[6].\nAylesworth Q.C. and Rankin Q.C. for the respondent. That improvement work can be done without a petition, see Re Townships of Caradoc and Ekfrid[7]; Re Stonehouse and Plympton5; and see also Bickford v. Corporation of Chatham[8].\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming a judgment of the High Court dismissing an action instituted by the appellants to restrain the respondents, the Municipality of Romney (for reasons stated in the statement of claim), from enforcing two certain by-laws numbered respectively 601 and 602, passed by the Municipal Council of the Township of Romney against the lands of the appellants in the pleadings mentioned, situate in the Township of Romney, and for other relief. These by-laws profess to have been passed by virtue of authority claimed to have been conferred by an Act of the Legislature of Ontario, 57 Vict. ch. 56, intituled \u201cAn Act to consolidate and amend the drainage laws,\u201d whereas the contention of the appellants is that, upon the facts appearing in evidence, the said consolidated Act did not confer any authority to affect the lands of the appellants with the burden purported to be imposed upon them by the said by-laws. The objections to these by-laws, relied upon by the appellants, rest upon different considerations, and so they must be dealt with separately.\nThe by-law 601 purports to be a by-law passed by the Municipal Council of Romney for the purpose of giving effect to a by-law of the Municipality of the Township of Tilbury West, assuming to impose a burthen upon the lands of the appellants situate in Romney to bear a part of the cost of certain works mentioned in a by-law No. 45 of the Township of Tilbury West passed in 1897 under the title of \u201cA by-law to provide for extending and otherwise improving Big Creek, in the Townships of Tilbury North and Tilbury West.\u201d\nThe questions arising in this appeal necessitate a review of the several Acts of the province relating to drainage works, but it will not be necessary to go further back than the year 1873, upon the 29th of March in which year two Acts of the Legislature of Ontario were passed, the one being 36 Vict. c. 38, intituled \u201cAn Act to authorise a further expenditure of public money for drainage works,\u201d to which by the Act is given the short title of \u201cThe Ontario Drainage Act, 1873\u201d; and the other being 36 Vict. c. 39, intituled \u201cAn Act to authorise the investment of certain monies in debentures to be issued for the construction of drainage works by municipalities.\u201d This Act by sec. 29 is given the short title of the \u201cMunicipal Drainage Aid Act.\u201d\nThe first section of this Act repealed a former Act 35 Vict. c. 26 and substituted therefor, in the precise language of the repealed Act, the provisions following, among others:\n2. In case the majority in number of the owners as shewn by the last revised assessment roll to be resident on the property to be benefited in any part of any municipality, do petition the council for the deepening of any stream, creek or water course or for the draining of the property (describing it) the council may procure an examination to be made by an engineer or provincial land surveyor, of the stream, creek or watercourse proposed to be deepened, or of the locality proposed to be drained, and may procure plans and estimates to be made of the work by such engineer or provincial land surveyor and an assessment to be made by such engineer or surveyor of the real property to be benefited by such deepening or drainage stating as nearly as may be in the opinion of such engineer or provincial land surveyor, the proportion of benefit to be derived by such deepening or drainage by every road and lot or portion of a lot, and if the council be of opinion that the deepening of such stream, creek or water course, or the draining of the locality described or a portion thereof would be desirable the council may pass by-laws; * * *\n1. For providing for the deepening of the stream, creek or watercourse or the draining of the locality;\n2. For borrowing on the credit of the municipality the funds necessary for the work and for issuing the debentures of the municipality therefor;\n3. For assessing and levying in the same manner as taxes are levied, upon the real property to be benefited by the deepening or draining, a special rate sufficient for the payment of the principal and interest of the debentures, and for so assessing and levying the same * * * by an assessment and rate on the real property so benefited * * * as nearly as may be to the benefit derived by each lot or portion of lot and road in the locality; * * * *\n4. For regulating the times and manner in which the assessment shall be paid; * * * *\n5. For determining what real property will be benefited by the deepening or draining and the proportion in which the assessment should be made on the various portions of lands so benefited; * * * *\nsubject, however, to appeal before the Court of Revi- sion, and from thence to the Judge of the County Court as in the case of ordinary assessments.\nThe above provisions relate to works constructed wholly within the limits of the municipality passing the by-law for its construction and which works confer benefit only on lands situate within the limits of such municipality.\nThen section 6 of the Act enacted that:\n6. Whenever it is necessary to continue the deepening or drainage aforesaid beyond the limits of any municipality, the engineer or surveyor employed by the council of such municipality may continue the survey and levels into the adjoining municipality until he finds fall enough to carry the water beyond the limits of the municipality in which the deepening or drainage was commenced.\nThen section 7 provides for the case of lands outside of the municipality in which such work of deepening or draining is constructed being benefited by such work in an adjoining municipality as follows:\n7. When the deepening and drainage do not extend beyond the limits of the municipality in which they are commenced, but in the opinion of the engineer or surveyor aforesaid benefit lands in an adjoining municipality, or greatly improve any road lying within any municipality or between two or more municipalities then the engineer or surveyor aforesaid shall charge the lands to be so benefited * * * * with such proportion of the cost of the work as he may deem just.\nThen by section 8 it is enacted that\nthe engineer or surveyor aforesaid shall determine and report to the council by which he was employed whether the deepening or drainage shall be constructed and maintained solely at the expense of such municipality or whether it shall be constructed and maintained at the expense of both municipalities, and in what proportion.\nProvision then is made for service, by the council of the municipality undertaking such work, upon the head of the council of an adjoining municipality the lands in which are so benefited, of a copy of the report, plans and specifications of the engineer so far as they affect such last mentioned municipality. And in section 10 it is enacted that unless the same is appealed from as hereinbefore provided it shall be binding on the council of such municipality,\nwhich council is required in such case by section eleven to\npass a by-law in the same manner as if a majority of the owners resident on the lands to be taxed had petitioned as provided in the first section of this Act to raise such sum as may be named in the report, or in case of an appeal, for such sum as may be determined by the arbitrators.\nProvision is then made for an appeal by the council of the adjoining municipality whose lands or roads are to be benefited as aforesaid to arbitrators to be appointed, one by the council of each of the said municipalities and a third by the two so chosen, whose award is, by section 15, declared to be binding upon all parties, and that a copy shall be registered with the registrar of deeds for the county in which either of the municipalities is situate.\nThen by section 17 it was enacted that\nafter such deepening or drainage is fully made and completed, it shall be the duty of each municipality in the proportion determined by the engineer or arbitrators, as the case may be, or until otherwise determined by the engineer or arbitrators, under the same formalities as near as may be as provided in the preceding sections, to preserve, maintain and keep in repair the same within its own limits either at the expense of the municipality or parties more immediately interested, or at the joint expense of such parties and the municipality, as to the council, upon the report of the engineer or surveyor may seem just, and any such municipality neglecting or refusing so to do upon reasonable notice being given by any party interested therein shall be compelled by mandamus to be issued from any court of competent jurisdiction to make from time to time the necessary repairs to preserve and maintain the same, and shall be liable to pecuniary damage to any person whose property shall be injuriously affected by reason of such neglect or refusal.\nThen by sec. 18 it was enacted that\nshould a drain already constructed or hereafter constructed by a municipality be used as an outlet or otherwise by another municipality, company or individual, such municipality, company or individual using the same as an outlet or otherwise may be assessed for the construction and maintenance thereof in such proportion and amount as shall be ascertained by the engineer, surveyor or arbitrators under the formalities provided in the preceding sections.\nThen by sec. 27 it was enacted that all disputes as to damages alleged to have been done to any property in the construction of drainage works or consequent thereon should be referred to arbitration in the manner provided in the Act and that the award made thereon should be binding upon all parties.\nAll of the above provisions were repeated in the Municipal Institutions Act, [36 Vict. c. 48,] passed in the same session of the Legislature of Ontario by which Act it was further among other things enacted, s. 372, s. s. 10 that the council of every municipality may pass by-laws\nfor opening, making, preserving, improving, repairing, widening, altering, diverting, stopping up and pulling down drains, sewers or watercourses within the jurisdiction of the council.\nthis enactment plainly related to the general powers of municipal councils over property within the municipality and had no reference to any drainage work of the character of drains constructed or to be constructed by a municipality under the provisions of the special local acts relating to drains constructed at the cost of the parties whose lands should be specially benefited by such works.\nPrior to the month of February, 1875, two drains had been constructed in the Township of Romney and wholly at the cost of that township, and the lands therein benefited thereby, under the provisions of the Act above set out; one of these drains, called the Campbell Drain, commenced at a point in the westerly end of the third concession of the township and extended from thence northerly along the line between lots numbers eighteen and nineteen to the town line constituting the northern limit of the Township of Romney and the southern limit of the Township of East Tilbury. From this point the drain was continued westerly along the Romney side of the said town line to the north-west angle of Romney from which point it was continued into and across two lots in the ninth concession of Tilbury West for the distance of about 196 rods where it was connected with a natural stream or watercourse, called the East Branch of Big Creek, which rising close by that spot flows down a natural descent of fifteen feet in three miles to a point in lot fifteen, in the seventh concession of Tilbury West called \u201cThe Forks,\u201d where its waters flow into another natural stream or watercourse called \u201cBig Creek,\u201d which rises in the westerly end of the eighth concession of the Township of Mersea (which lies west of Romney and south of Tilbury West,) and after crossing several concessions in Mersea and in Tilbury West, its waters become united with the waters of the stream called the East Branch at the place called the \u201cForks,\u201d from which point the waters of the two streams flow as one stream to its outlet into the River Thames about half a mile east of where the Thames falls into Lake St. Clair. The other of these drains in Romney is called \u201cDrain No. 4\u201d which commencing at a point in the easterly end of the third concession in Romney runs northerly to the northerly limit of the said township opposite to the Township of East Tilbury at a point where the line between the fourth and fifth concessions of Romney intersects the north town line of Romney from which point it extends westerly along the Romney side of the said town line until it reaches the point where the Campbell Drain reached the same town line; from that point the Campbell Drain was deepened and widened to the north-west angle of Romney and thence for the aforesaid distance of 196 rods into Tilbury West where connection was made as aforesaid with the said stream called the East Branch, which thus became the outlet of these two drains.\nThe extension of these two Romney drains into Tilbury West until fall enough was found to carry the waters coming down the drains beyond the limits of the Township of Romney was in perfect accordance with the provisions of 36 Vict. c. 39, sec. 6 (above extracted), and the outlet so reached being a natural stream or watercourse, the Romney drains so conducted into it had as perfect a right to the use of it as such outlet as if the stream where the combined drains reached it had been, and for some distance had continued to be, within the Township of Romney.\nAt this same time the Council of the Township of Tilbury West had procured two land surveyors, Mr. Augustine McDonnell and a Mr. J.S. Holwell, to design and make plans of several drainage works within the township. The council of the township declined to undertake themselves the construction of the works or any of the works which were by these gentlemen respectively designed and suggested upon the ground, as is said, that they were too expensive for construction under 36 Vict. c. 39, but they made application to the Provincial Government to construct them under the provisions of 36 Vict. c. 38.\nUpon the 3rd June, 1875, the township clerk of the township addressed a letter to the Chief Engineer of Public Works in the Province in the terms following:\nTOWNSHIP CLERK\u2019S OFFICE,\nTilbury West, 3rd June, 1875.\nSIR,\u2014In reply to your letter of the 26th April now last past addressed to Pierre Tremblay, Esq., Reeve of Tilbury West, respecting drainage works in Tilbury West which have been surveyed by Messrs. Holwell and McDonell, Civil Engineers, I am directed by the Council of Tilbury West to inform you that the said municipal council are very desirous for the Government to undertake the construction of all the drainage works embraced in both the said surveys. You will see by turning over this leaf that the council laid this matter before the ratepayers in open meetings of the council, and there was not one word said against the council applying to the Government to undertake the construction of the said drainage works.\nAnd upon the 3rd July, 1875, Mr. Pierre Tremblay, Reeve of the Township, addressed a letter to the Hon. C.F. Fraser, Commissioner of Public Works for the Province of Ontario, in the terms following:\nSIR,\u2014The Municipal Council of Tilbury West, county of Essex, desire the following drainage works constructed under the provisions of the Ontario Drainage Act, 36 Vict. c. 38, viz.: \u201cThe Tremblay Creek Drain,\u201d \u201cBig Creek Outlet,\u201d and the two branches thereof; also the creek known as \u201cLittle Creek\u201d from the lake southerly as far as necessary, and the drains called Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 of Mr. Holwell\u2019s survey.\nBy this statute, 36 Vict. c. 38, it was enacted that the Commissioner of Public Works on the written application of the council of any municipality, or on the petition of a majority of the owners, as shewn on the last revised assessment roll resident on the property to be described in the petition, the whole or any portion of which is to be benefited by the drainage, may undertake and complete the same as if the council had applied for the drainage. Then it was enacted that the Commissioner of Public Works should notify the council of any municipality in which drainage works had been executed under the provisions of the Act requesting them to appoint three assessors who should assess all lands and roads benefited by such drainage. The Act then, in the 14th section, enacted that as soon as conveniently might be after any works for the drainage or improvement of any land authorised to be executed under the Act should have been completed, the commissioner should furnish the assessors with a map of the municipality with the drain or drains marked upon it, and a statement of the sums expended in and about the works so executed, upon receipt of which, assessors should inspect the lands and assess them setting opposite each parcel of land the proportion which ought to be payable in respect of the several parcels.\nThen in sec. 16 provision was made to the like effect as in sec. 7 of 36 Vict. c. 39, that when the drainage works do not extend beyond the limits of the municipality in which they were commenced, but in the opinion of the assessors benefit lands in an adjoining municipality, then that the assessors should charge the lands so benefited with such proportion of the cost of the works as they might deem just; like provision then was made for an appeal by the council of the municipality whose lands are benefited without the drainage works being continued thereinto, to arbitrators whose award, as provided in simile casu in 36 Vict. ch. 39, should be final upon all parties. Then in sec. 25, provision was made for the maintenance and keeping in repair of the drainage works executed under the Act at the expense of the parties whose lands respectively are benefited by the works to the like effect as is provided in sec. 17 of 36 Vict. c. 39. Then sec. 26 enacted that should any drain constructed under the provisions of that Act, 36 Vict. c. 38, be used as an outlet or otherwise by any other municipality, company or individual, such municipality, company or individual might be assessed for the construction and maintenance of the drain so used as an outlet in such proportion and amount as should be ascertained by the assessors or arbitrators under the formalities provided in the preceding sections.\nWe have seen by the above letter of the 3rd July, 1875, that the works which the Commissioner of Public Works was requested to execute under the provisions of 36 Vict. c. 38, consisted of nine several separate and distinct works, and as such when all were completed they were, in the year 1878, returned for the purpose of assessment of the lands benefited by the said several works respectively under the provisions of the said Act then consolidated as chapter 33 in the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1877. The drain called Tremblay Creek Drain is a natural stream or watercourse called \u201cTremblay Creek,\u201d which rises in Tilbury East, which several artificially constructed drains, constructed under the provisions of \u201cThe Municipal Drainage Acts,\u201d now use as their outlet. This stream enters Tilbury West in lot 22, in the 6th concession of that township, and after crossing the line between the townships Tilbury East and Tilbury West, and running by a devious course across the 6th, 5th, 4th, 3rd and 2nd concessions (in which latter concession it passes under the Canadian Pacific Railway on lot No. 20) and after crossing said lot No. 20 enters Big Creek proper at or about the centre line of the south half of lot No. 19 in the first concession. The cost of this work as returned for assessment of the several parcels of land benefited by it is $4,156.79.\nThe drain called \u201cLittle Creek\u201d drain is a small natural watercourse which rises in or about lot No. 10 in the seventh concession of Tilbury West, runs into and through the lots numbered 11 in the several concessions in a northerly course to the second concession in which it enters lot No. 10, and thence enters lot No. 10 in the first concession, an angle of which it crosses into lot No. 11 in the first concession and flows through the last mentioned lot northerly and lot No. 11 in the broken front concession in which lot, passing under the Grand Trunk Railway, it empties its waters directly into Lake St. Clair. The cost of this work as returned for assessment of the several parcels of land benefited by it is $6,095.96. The course of this work is distant from and lying to the west of Big Creek proper by from 1\u00bd to 2\u00bd miles. The work called the West Branch Drain was work done also in a natural stream or watercourse, namely that part of the stream called Big Creek which rising, as already said, in the Township of Mersea flows across Mersea and Tilbury West, until, under the name of \u201cThe West Branch\u201d it reaches the point called the \u201cForks\u201d on lot 15 in the seventh concession. From this point to its mouth the stream is called Big Creek proper. The cost of the work done in this West Branch as returned for assessment of the several parcels of land benefited by that work was $5,305.26.\nThe drains designated by numbers \u201c1, 2, 3 and 4 of Mr. Holwell\u2019s survey,\u201d were wholly artificially constructed drains situate respectively in the 7th, 9th, 10th and 11th concessions of Tilbury West, west of the West Branch, into which as their outlets they respectively debouch in those respective concessions, and the cost of the construction of each, as returned for assessment of the several parcels of land benefited by each of these respective works, was as follows:\nNo. 1 Drain in 7th concession................... $2,836.99\nNo. 2 \u201c 9th \u201c ..................... 2,348.93\nNo. 3 \u201c 10th \u201c .. 2,545.51\nNo. 4 \u201c 11th \u201c .. 2,018.74\nThe work done upon the Big Creek proper extended from the Forks in lot 15, in the seventh concession, to the concession line between the third and fourth concessions at lot No. 18. The distance of this point from the shore of the Lake St. Clair, in the broken front concession, is fully 4\u00bd miles in about a due north direction, while the distance along the stream which here takes a more north-easterly and easterly direction to its mouth in the River Thames, east of Lake St. Clair, is between six and seven miles. The greatest height of any land between this concession line and the lake in this neighbourhood is said to be three feet. All the evidence concurred in saying that the height varied from one to three feet. A witness who had been employed on this work, which was executed by the Ontario Government in 1878, says that the work was carried as far as it could be because of the waters of the lake, which were so very high then. The cost of this work, as returned for assessment of the several parcels of land benefited by it, was $5,983.32.\nThe only other work comprehended in the works thus undertaken by the Provincial Government was done upon the East Branch stream which also is a natural stream or watercourse, and the work done upon this stream, which as already mentioned had a fall of fifteen feet to its mouth at the Forks, a distance of three miles, and in which the two drains in Romney had their outlet, extended from about the point where the Romney drains in one channel debouched into the said East Branch about half a mile or three quarters of a mile distant from the north-west angle of Romney to the mouth of the said East Branch Stream at the Forks. The cost of the work done on this stream, as returned for assessment of the several parcels of land benefited by this work, was $3,570.34.\nNow it appears to be clear beyond all controversy that no lands in Romney derived or could by possibility be supposed to derive any benefit whatever from the work done on the Little Creek which debouched into Lake St. Clair at a point in the broken front concession of Tilbury West about three miles west of the mouth of Big Creek. So neither could any lands in Romney be supposed to derive any benefit from the work done upon Tremblay Creek, which emptied into Big Creek in the first concession of Tilbury West about two miles from its mouth, but where its waters in their natural state were almost, if not actually, upon a level with the waters of Lake St. Clair; nor from the work done in any of the drains numbered \u201c1, 2, 3 and 4 of Mr. Holwell\u2019s survey\u201d as above described; nor from the work done on Big Creek proper itself\u2014that is to say, between the place called \u201cThe Forks\u201d and the termination of the work at or about the line between the third and fourth concessions.\nThe only work by which the lands in Romney could have been supposed to have been benefited was the work done on the East Branch Stream by deepening and it may be widening that stream where it had been so as aforesaid made the outlet of the Romney drains above mentioned. The improvement of this outlet constituted the sole benefit conferred upon lands in Romney. The cost of this work as we have seen was $3,570.34.\nNow I think it may fairly be assumed that the assessors to whom was entrusted the duty to determine the amount chargeable to lands in Romney for such benefit, did as I think they should have done, that is to say, did according to the best of their judgment, charge all the Romney lands benefited by apportioning to those lands such proportion of the cost of that work as they considered fair and just having regard to the value to those lands of the improvement to the outlet of the Romney drains so as aforesaid made into the said East Branch Stream. The assessors determined all the lands in Romney which were so benefited and upon a roll they set opposite to each lot the amount chargeble to each; and here it may incidentally be remarked that lots Nos. 21, 22 and 23, in the third concession, (450 acres of which are now owned by the appellants and have been charged by the by-law of Tilbury West which the by-law 601 of Romney has been passed to give effect unto, with the sum of $414.42, notwithstanding that some time since 1878 the council of the Township of Romney have, under the provisions of 36 Vict. ch. 39, constructed a drain along the front of said lots in the 3rd concession, which by a tunnel through a ridge of high land which separates the water flowing into Lake St. Clair from those flowing into Lake Erie, whereby means of drainage of the said lots in the 3rd concession into Lake Erie is supplied in relief of the No. 4 drain in Romney) were not entered as lands benefited and were not charged with any sum. The total amount chargeable to lands in Romney, as adjudged by the assessors, was $2,127 or about two-thirds of the cost of the work done in the East Branch; of this amount the sum charged to lands in the fourth and fifth concessions now owned by the appellants containing in the whole 1,000 acres, was $120. Upon appeal by the council of Romney from this assessment it was reduced by an award made by arbitrators under the provisions of the statute in that behalf who adjudged and awarded as follows:\nThat the said assessment be reduced from the said sum of two thousand one hundred and twenty-seven dollars to the sum of twelve hundred dollars, said sum to be distributed and apportioned over and upon the said lands and highways particularly specified in the said assessment roll in the same relative proportion that they bear one to the other at present, in and by the said roll, the said reduction being equal to about forty-three per cent and three-fifths of one per cent upon each of the respective assessments.\nThe effect of this award was to reduce the sum total of the charge upon the lands now owned by the appellants as aforesaid from $120 to $67.70.\nNow that award so made operated as a conclusive adjudication of what lands in Romney were benefited by the works constructed, and it operated as I think further, by force of the statutory provisions in that behalf, as determining conclusively and judicially the utmost extent to which the lands so benefited in Romney and so assessed for cost of construction, could be charged for the cost of the repair and maintenance of the work from time to time when necessary.\nAll of the above provisions of 36 Vict. c. 39 so incorporated into the Municipal Institutions Act of the same year, 36 Vict ch. 48, with certain alterations and additions from time to time subsequently made, have been retained in the several sections relating to drainage works, inserted in the several Municipal Institutions Acts passed from thence until the year 1894, when the Drainage Act of 1894, 57 Vict. ch. 56 was passed, in which are consolidated all the provisions of the Municipal Institutions Act of 1892 relating to drainage works constructed upon the local improvement principle, namely, that the cost of the construction and of the repair and maintenance thereof should be chargeable and charged wholly upon the lands benefited thereby and the owners of such lands. Although the point now immediately under consideration relates solely to the liability of lands of the appellants, situate in the Township of Romney, to contribute to payment of the cost of works which by the by-law of Tilbury West (which the by-law 601 of Romney is passed to give effect unto) were proposed to be executed chiefly within the Township of Tilbury North, and the residue within the Township of Tilbury West, still as the contention of the respondents is that the fundamental principle of the statutes relating to works of local improvement (which these clauses affecting drainage works are) has been wholly subverted by 57 Vict. c. 56, I shall take occasion to refer briefly to the main provisions of that statute before dwelling upon those which bear specially upon the question raised in this appeal, which is as to the jurisdiction of the council of Tilbury West to charge the lands of the appellants situate in the Township of Romney for the cost of the works as proposed to be executed under the by-law of Tilbury West which the by\u2011law 601 of Romney was passed to give effect unto.\nBy sec. 3, s. s. 1, the petition for the construction of any drain, or the deepening, widening, clearing of obstructions or otherwise improving any stream, creek or watercourse, &c., &c., must be in the form formerly prescribed and in it must be described, as formerly, the area proposed to be drained by the particular species of work mentioned in the petition, and it is the area so proposed to be drained, or the stream or watercourse proposed to be deepened, straightened, widened, cleared of obstructions, or otherwise improved according to the prayer of the petition that the engineer is authorised to make an examination of\nand to prepare a report, plans, specifications and estimates of the drainage work, and to make an assessment of the lands and roads within said area to be benefited, and of any other lands and roads liable to be assessed as hereinafter provided, stating, as nearly as may be, in his opinion the proportion of the cost of the work to be paid by every road and lot or portion of lot, for benefit and for outlet and relief from injuring liability as hereinafter defined.\nThen sub-sec. 2 enacts that the provisions of the preceding sub-section shall apply in every case where the drainage work can only be effectually executed by embanking, pumping or other mechanical operations, but in every such case the municipal council shall not proceed except upon the petition of at least two-thirds of the owners of lands within the area described according to said sub-section.\nThen the definition of the term \u201cinjuring liability\u201d as used in the Act is given in sub-sec. 3:\nIf from the lands or roads of any municipality, company or individual, water is by any means caused to flow upon and injure the lands and roads of any other municipality, company or individual, the lands and roads from which the water is so caused to flow may under all the formalities and powers contained herein, except the petition, be assessed and charged for the construction and maintenance of the drainage work required for relieving the injured lands or roads from such water and to the extent of the cost of the work necessary for their relief as may be determined by the engineer or surveyor, Court of Revision, county judge, or referee, and such assessment may be termed \u201cinjuring liability.\u201d\nThen the definition of the term \u201coutlet liability,\u201d as used in the Act, is given in sub-sec. 4.\nThe lands and roads of any municipality, company or individual using any drainage work as an outlet, or for which when the work is constructed an improved outlet is thereby provided either directly or through the medium of any other drainage work or of a swale, ravine, creek or watercourse, may, under all the formalities and powers contained herein, except the petition, be assessed and charged for the construction and maintenance of the drainage work so used as an outlet, or providing an improved outlet and to the extent of the cost of the work necessary for any such outlet as may be determined by the engineer or surveyor, court of revision, county judge or referee, and such assessment may be termed \u201coutlet liability.\u201d\nThen precise directions for determining in every case what lands shall be chargeable with \u201cinjuring liability\u201d and also with \u201coutlet liability,\u201d as those terms are used in the Act, and how the amounts chargeable to each lot in respect of each of those liabilities shall be determined is given in s. s. 5 of this third section.\nSub-section 5: The assessment for injuring liability and outlet liability provided for in the two next preceding sub-sections shall be based upon the volume and shall also have regard to the speed of the water artificially caused to flow upon the injured lands, or into the drainage work from the lands and roads liable for such assessments.\nThen by section 57 provision is made for the assessment of lands \u201cbenefited\u201d by any drainage work, as this term \u201cbenefited\u201d had always been used in all previous statutes relating to drainage works constructed under municipal by-laws, in precisely the same circumstances in which \u201clands using any drainage works as an outlet\u201d are authorised to be assessed by sec. 3 s. s. 3 and 4. Sec. 57: Where any drainage work is not continued into any other than the initiating municipality any lands or roads in the initiating municipality or in any other municipality or roads between two or more municipalities which will in the opinion of the engineer or surveyor be benefited by such work or furnished with an improved outlet or relieved from liability for causing water to flow upon and injure lands or roads may be assessed for such proportion of the cost of the work as to the engineer or surveyor seems just.\nThen the Act prescribed that in the by-law \u201cshall be\u201d set out \u201cthe purport of the petition describing generally the lands and roads to be benefited.\u201d\nNow whatever may have been the reason (for none appears in the statute) for this alteration in the language of the provisions contained in the third section which, read literally, purports to authorise the engineer to make an assessment not only on the lands and roads to be benefited within the area of the proposed work, but also of \u201cany other lands and roads liable to be assessed as hereinafter provided,\u201d I find an insuperable difficulty in construing them as having the intent and effect contended for by the respondents, namely, of abrogating the fundamental, essential, principle upon which rest these clauses in the Municipal Institutions Acts for constructing local works for the improvement of particular lands at the cost of the owners of the lands which are benefited thereby, expressed in the maxim qui sentit commodum sentire debet et onus, and substituting therefor a provision which subjects persons who derive no benefit whatever from the work to contribute to the payment of its cost. There is nothing new in the substantial elements of the ideas expressed by the terms \u201cinjuring liability,\u201d and \u201coutlet liability.\u201d These were matters which had always to be taken into consideration as part of the cost of the work to be constructed under all previous municipal by-laws passed for the construction of drainage works. As to \u201cinjuring liability\u201d under a clause in the Municipal Institutions Act which subjected all persons whose lands were benefited by the proposed work to assessment to bear and pay for (as part of the cost of the work) any damage done in the construction of or consequent upon the construction of the work, and if a sufficient sum was not included in the assessment (of the lands benefited), for the cost of construction to compensate for all damages subsequently appearing to have been occasioned as consequential upon the construction, relief for such damage (how great soever it might be) could be obtained by, and only by, an award made under the provisions of the Acts in that behalf, though the damage occasioned could not have been foreseen and became developed only many years after the construction of the works to which the damage was attributed and arose directly by reason of non repair of the works. This appears to be the effect of the judgment of the Privy Council in Williams v. Corporation of Raleigh[9].\nIt can scarcely be contended that the legislature had any intention, in passing 57 Vic. c. 56, to exempt the owners of land benefited by a drainage work constructed under the Act from injuring liability of this nature, and yet the Act in its terms only authorises an assessment to be made for \u201cinjuring liability,\u201d when the injury and its cause are apparent and are of the precise nature of that described in sec. 3, s. s. 3; and surely there cannot be entertained a doubt that, if water, which, (to use the language of the subsection) had been caused to flow from any lands, the property of one person, upon other lands so as to injure such other lands, is so cut off and carried away by any drainage work constructed under sec. 3 as to relieve the injured lands from the injury so caused, and to relieve the owners of the land from which the waters so flowed from liability, that constitutes undoubtedly a most material benefit conferred by the said drainage work upon the owner of the land from which the water was so caused to flow for which his land so benefited is justly chargeable in the mode prescribed in the Act in its definition of \u201cinjuring liability,\u201d with an assessment for the benefit so conferred. The Act, however, in some degree sets a limit to the arbitrary discretion of the engineer or land surveyor in determining the amount chargeable for such benefit by prescribing that the amount to be charged shall be based upon a calculation of the volume in which and the speed at which, the water is artificially caused to flow from the lands from which they do flow to and upon the injured lands, or into the drainage work which cut this water off.\nThis provision seems to be calculated, if not intended, to afford some protection to the parties assessed against the uncontrolled discretion of the engineer or land surveyor initiating the scheme of drainage work, first, by providing that before any authority is vested in the engineer or land surveyor to make any assessment for \u201cinjuring liability,\u201d there must, in each particular case, be a \u201ccorpus delicti,\u201d so to speak, that is to say, there must be apparent, water which is caused to flow by an artificial channel from the lands to be assessed into the drainage work or upon other lands to their injury, which water is to be carried off by the proposed drainage work, and each assessment must be made upon the circumstances of each particular case upon the basis prescribed in the subsection 5; and, secondly, as supplying some mode, though not a very perfect one, of testing the value of the calculations as made by the engineer.\nThat this is well calculated to be of some benefit to the parties assessed is apparent from the present case, in which the engineer (apparently in the mere exercise of an uncontrolled discretion) has assessed all of the lands of the appellants in Romney at 30 cents per acre for injuring liability, whereas another engineer, one of the respondent\u2019s own witnesses, of upwards of twenty years practice of his profession in the immediate neighbourhood of the lands in question, said that he could not see any foundation whatever for any charge for \u201cinjuring liability,\u201d and, in point of fact, not a single case appeared of any injury whatever of the nature of that which is defined in the Act as \u201cinjuring liability\u201d; no case whatever of water caused to flow artificially from any lands into the Romney drains having their outlet as aforesaid in said East Branch Stream or indeed into any drainage work or upon any lands.\nThen as to \u201coutlet liability\u201d nothing can be more mistaken than the idea that an assessment by way of enforcing contribution to the payment of the cost of a drainage work constructed under the provisions of the Act, can under the term \u201coutlet liability\u201d be made upon lands not benefited by the work. The idea of \u201coutlet liability\u201d apart from benefit is inconceivable; but the language of the Act upon this subject is, I think, sufficiently clear, upon the question when, and when only, an assessment may be made for \u201coutlet liability.\u201d Section 59 enacts, as had been enacted by all the drainage work clauses in the several Municipal Institutions Acts from time to time in force, that a drainage work commenced in one municipality \u201cmay be continued into another municipality until a sufficient outlet is reached,\u201d and this term \u201csufficient outlet\u201d is, by the interpretation section of the present Act, defined to mean \u201cthe safe discharge of water at a point where it will do no injury to lands or roads.\u201d In every such case the engineer may assess all lands and roads to be \u201caffected by benefit, outlet or relief.\u201d\nThen the Act in sufficiently plain terms defines what it means by this term \u201coutlet,\u201d and prescribes the only occasion when liability to assessment for \u201coutlet liability\u201d shall arise.\nSec. 3, s.s. 4. The lands and roads of any municipality, company, or individual using any drainage work as an outlet or for which, when the work is constructed, an improved outlet is thereby provided, * * * * may * * * * be assessed and charged for the construction and maintenance of the drainage work so used as an outlet,\nbut only \u201cto the extent of the cost of the work necessary for any such \u201coutlet.\u201d Then in sub\u2011section 5, is enacted the mode by which the amount to be charged to each particular lot to be assessed is to be determined.\nA careful consideration of the Act therefore condemns, in my judgment, as wholly inadmissible, a construction which should hold that lands not benefited by a drainage work constructed under the provisions of the Act are nevertheless made liable to assessment for \u201cinjuring liability\u201d or \u201coutlet liability,\u201d notwithstanding the words in the third section purporting to authorise the engineer \u201cto make an assessment of the lands and roads within said area to be benefited and of any other lands and roads liable to assessment as hereinafter provided.\u201d\nThe provisions coming under the terms \u201cas hereinafter provided\u201d seem I think to favour rather the construction that what the legislature intended was, to provide, in the interest of the persons to be assessed, that the sums to be assessed upon all lands benefited by the work should shew the nature of each item charged separately as follows: 1. For \u201cbenefit,\u201d meaning, I apprehend thereby (for no definition is given of this work in the Act), the benefit conferred by the facility for the drainage of all lands within the area of the drainage work, which benefit would vary according to the difference of elevation of the respective lots\u2014the quantity of water to be drained from each\u2014the distance of the several lots from the drainage work\u2014and the like. 2. For \u201cinjuring liability,\u201d i.e. for the special charge to each lot from which water is caused to flow to the injury of other lands in the manner described in the Act under the definition of \u201cinjuring liability\u201d; the whole of the cost of this work in so far as it relates to the removal of this water is to be borne specially by an assessment upon the lot from which the water doing the injury is so caused to flow. 3. For \u201coutlet liability\u201d\u2014which is only authorised to be assessed for in the one particular case of a drain constructed in one township being continued into another until a \u201csufficient outlet\u201d for the waters coming down such drain is reached.\nThe application of the same precise mode for determining the amounts chargeable for \u201cinjuring liability\u201d and for \u201coutlet liability\u201d does not appear to be, I think, quite felicitous. The just mode of applying that subsection to \u201coutlet liability\u201d would seem to be; first, to determine the total amount chargeable for \u201coutlet liability\u201d by a calculation based upon the volume in which and the speed at which this water comes down the drain to its outlet in another municipality than that in which the drain is initiated; and secondly, to apportion that sum among the several lots from which the water is caused to flow by artificial means from the lands assessable into the drains upon a calculation based upon the volume in which and the speed at which such waters are respectively so caused to flow into the drain. In any case all lands from which no water is so caused to flow into a drain having its outlet in another municipality than that in which the drain was initiated would be exempt from assessment, and this is the condition of all of the lands of the appellants in Romney assessed for \u201coutlet liability\u201d in the present case.\nTwo sections still remain, to which alone it seems to be necessary to refer, viz., sections 70 and 75, upon the latter of which the main contention of the respondents has been rested.\nSection 70 is the only section of the Act which in terms is made applicable to a work constructed under the Ontario Drainage Act, 36 Vict. c. 38. The section simply enacts that the same provisions as to the repair and maintenance of a work constructed under the Ontario Drainage Act, and initiated in one municipality but continued into another to a \u201csufficient outlet,\u201d there reached as in sec. 69, are made applicable in similar circumstances in the case of a work constructed under a municipal by-law. The provisions of sec. 70 had their origin in the Municipal Amendment Act, 48 Vict c. 39, sec. 26, which made the sections of the Municipal Institutions Act of 1883, 46 Vict. c. 18, as to the maintenance and repair of a work initiated in one municipality and continued into another until an outlet is reached, and constructed under a municipal by-law, applicable to the case of a work initiated in one municipality and in like circumstances continued into another, and constructed under the Ontario Drainage Act. The utility of this enactment is not apparent for precisely similar provisions as those contained in the Municipal Acts in relation to works constructed under municipal by-laws, were contained in the Ontario Drainage Act, 36 Vict. c. 38 in relation to like works constructed under that Act; and as an award was made in 1878, under the provisions of that statute, which determined the extent of the liability of lands in Romney for the construction, maintenance and repair of the work executed by the Ontario Government in the East Branch stream at the point where the Romney drains continued into the Township of Tilbury West reached their sufficient outlet the necessity of section 70 is not apparent.\nHowever, this is by the way at present, for we are not now dealing with a by-law passed for maintenance and repair of the work for which the lands in Romney were assessed in 1878 and done by the Ontario Government in the outlet of the Romney drains. When the question of the liability of lands in Romney to contribute to the cost of repair and maintenance of that work shall arise, it will be time enough to consider whether they can be rated for the cost of maintenance and repair in any greater proportion than that in which they were, by the award of 1878, rated for the cost of construction.\nHowever the language of this section 70 has, I think, some considerable bearing upon the construction of section 75 upon which the respondents so much rely. The legislature, by the language used in section 70, seems to shew a plain intention of limiting the application of the Act to works constructed under the Ontario Drainage Act, to the provisions of that section, namely, to cases of repair and maintenance alone.\nThen it is enacted by section 75 that wherever it shall be deemed expedient to change the course of any \u201cdrainage work\u201d\nconstructed under the provisions of this Act or any Act respecting drainage by local assessment, * * * * or to make a new outlet for the whole or any part of the work, or otherwise improve, extend or alter the work, or to cover the whole or any part of it, the council of the municipality or any of the municipalities whose duty it is to maintain the said drainage work may, without the petition required by section 3 of this Act, but on the report of an engineer, * * * * undertake and complete the change of course, new outlet, improvement, extension, alteration or covering specified in the report and the engineer or surveyor shall, for such change of course, new outlet, improvement, extension, alteration or covering, have all the powers to assess and charge lands and roads in any way liable to assessment under this Act for the expense thereof in the same manner and to the same extent * * * * as are provided with regard to any drainage work constructed under the provisions of this Act.\nNow while the language of this section is most apt when construed as applying only to a \u201cdrain,\u201d that is a wholly artificial work having a course capable of being altered, extended and improved, and having an \u201coutlet\u201d for which a new outlet is capable of being substituted, the language appears to be quite inapt to be applied to a work such as that done by the Ontario Government in Big Creek in 1878 terminating at the line between the third and fourth concessions of Tilbury West, which work consisted merely in the straightening and deepening the natural stream by dredging. Work of that character so terminating and done wholly in the bed of the running stream cannot be said to have there an outlet capable of being altered and to have another substituted therefor. The stream in which the work of dredging was done, flowed on in its natural course to its outlet (but that is quite a different thing), about seven miles further down, but the work done in that stream which consisted of deepening by dredging, and straightening, could not be said to have an outlet, to which section 75 could apply.\nThen again, this section 75 is enacted in lieu of section 585 of The Consolidated Municipal Act of 1892 which is repealed by section 114 of 57 Vict. c. 56. Now that section 585 so repealed was a clause in consolidation of section 585 of The Municipal Act, ch. 184, R.S.O. of 1887, which again was in consolidation of section 586 of The Municipal Institutions Act of 1883, [46 Vict. c. 18,] which again was but in consolidation of section 17 of 45 Vict. c. 26, an Act intituled \u201cAn Act to make further provision for the construction of Drainage Works by Municipalities,\u201d where the clause originated, and in each of these sections the word \u201cdrain\u201d was used in every place where the words \u201cdrainage works\u201d or \u201cwork\u201d (simply) occur in this section 75, so that the fair and reasonable construction of this section, I think, is that the words \u201cdrainage work\u201d and \u201cwork\u201d as used in it mean precisely the same thing as the word \u201cdrain\u201d as used in section 585 of the Act of 1892, and in all the other sections of the above mentioned Acts of which that section was but a consolidation, and nothing more. When then we find the legislature in section 70 applying in express terms the provisions of that section (as to repair and maintenance) to a work constructed under the \u201cOntario Drainage Act\u201d and in section 75 re-enacting all the provisions of the repealed section 585 of the Consolidated Municipal Act of 1892 except the words comprehending \u201ca work constructed under the Ontario Drainage Act\u201d the natural and reasonable conclusion would seem to be that the section could not be construed to have any application to such a work, and if all works constructed under the Ontario Drainage Act were of the character of the works appearing in this case as having been executed by the Ontario Government in 1878, with the exception of the drains 1, 2, 3 and 4 of Mr. Holwell\u2019s survey, the omission of those words of section 585 from this section 75 would appear to have been most wise, because of the inaptitude of the words used in the section to works of the character of those done in the beds of Big Creek and of Tremblay Creek and of the East and West Branches by the Ontario Government in 1878.\nThe language used in the section is apt enough to include works of the nature of the \u201cdrains Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 of Mr. Holwell\u2019s survey,\u201d if the words of the repealed section 585, comprehending works \u201ccon- structed under the Ontario Drainage Act\u201d had been re-enacted, but quite inapt by way of application to a work of straightening a running stream, or of deepening it by dredging. The effect of the omission of the above words from section 75 would seem to be, to exclude even the \u201cdrains Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 of Mr. Holwell\u2019s survey\u201d from the operation of the section which works, if the omitted words had been re-enacted, would have been within it; but assuming the words in the section, \u201cany drainage work constructed under the provisions of this Act or any Act respecting drainage by local assessment\u201d to be sufficient, by reason of these latter words, notwithstanding the omission of the omitted words, to include a work constructed under the Ontario Drainage Act, such work must be one constructed, that is to say, as it appears to me, must be an artificial drain just such as is mentioned in section 585 of the Act of 1892, and in all the previous Acts above mentioned since, and inclusive of 45 Vict. c. 26. The reasonable and natural construction of the section, by reason of the omission of the omitted words of section 585 appears to me to be that section 75, like all the other sections, except section 70, applies only to case of drainage works constructed, that is to artificial drains constructed, under municipal by-laws, and the exception made that the works contemplated by the section to be undertaken and completed by the council of the municipality whose duty it is to maintain such work \u201cwithout the petition\u201d required by section 3 of this Act seems to me to afford corroboration of that view. Why without such petition? Why should a work of the character referred to in the section, to be paid for by special local assessments under section 3, be constructed without the petition required in section 3, when such a projected work could not be entertained by a municipal council without such petition? The legislature must have had some reason for this distinction, and the only one which presents itself would seem to be, that, in the case of a drainage work constructed under a municipal by-law which only could be undertaken and constructed originally under such a petition as is provided in section 3, it was thought that power might be given to a municipal council which had authorised the construction of the work originally, or which had imposed upon it the duty to maintain such a work, to change the course of such work, or to make a new outlet for it, &c., &c., as mentioned in the section without the necessity of any further petition.\nThe by-law No. 45 of Tilbury West was, as we have seen, expressed to be passed\nto provide for extending and otherwise improving Big Creek, in the Townships of Tilbury North and Tilbury West.\nIn point of fact no such project was or could have been in contemplation; it would have been practically impossible. That the council of Tilbury West under R.S.O. of 1887 ch. 184 s. 479, s s. 15, which was the section in 1897 in force in consolidation of 36 Vict. c. 48 s. 372, s s. 10, above extracted, had power to widen, alter the course of, or even to extend (if that were possible) Big Creek, may be admitted, but such work performed under that section must needs have been performed at the charge of the general funds of the municipality. That such was not the intention of the council of Tilbury West can confidently be asserted. The council of Tilbury North appears to have entertained the idea that (under the provisions of section 7 of 54 Vict. c. 81, which was \u201cAn Act passed for the purpose of dividing Tilbury West into two townships, Tilbury North and Tilbury West\u201d) the council of Tilbury West had power, which the council of Tilbury North had not, to initiate and complete under the provisions of section 75 of 57 Vict. c. 56, a work of a purely local character by the construction of which the council of Tilbury North and the owners of certain lands therein situate would alone be benefited; the procuring the construction of which work unless it could be so procured to be undertaken was hopeless. It appears incontestible, upon the evidence, that this by-law 45 of Tilbury West was passed, and the works therein mentioned were undertaken, by the council of Tilbury West at the earnest instance and pressing solicitation of the council of Tilbury North. It is true that at the trial it was said that some individuals had made some applications by letter to the council of Tilbury West, but the nature of those applications did not appear, for upon counsel for the appellants insisting that they should not be spoken of unless produced the defendants in the action refused to produce them, and so the case was left to stand upon the evidence which was unequivocal, that the engineer was employed to make a report, but upon what particular matter did not appear, and that upon his report the by-law was passed and the work therein mentioned was undertaken at the special instance of the council of Tilbury North. This is an incontestible fact established by the evidence whatever may be the effect of the established fact. Whether the municipality of Tilbury West fulfil the condition precedent necessary to give them the right to act in the circumstances of the present case under section 75 of 57 Vict. ch. 56, may perhaps be open to some doubt, that is to say, whether the municipality had a duty imposed upon it to maintain the drainage works which, done by the Ontario Government in 1878, at the cost wholly, both as to construction and maintenance, of the owners of lands particularly benefited thereby, may perhaps be open to question. But no such point was made in the argument before us and I do not think that it is necessary that it should be decided on this appeal.\nNow by the Act 54 Vict. c. 81, Tilbury North was made to consist of\nall that portion of the former Township of Tilbury West which lies north of the centre of the road allowance between the ninth and tenth concessions, and east of the line between lots 15 and 16, and north of the centre of the road allowance between the range of lots north of the middle road and fourth concession, and north of the centre of the road allowance between the fourth and fifth concessions of said Township of Tilbury West.\nBy this description the whole of the land lying between Lake St. Clair, the extreme northern boundary of the township, and the line between the fourth and fifth concessions was situate in Tilbury North, and Big Creek proper also which extended from the Forks to its mouth at the River Thames with the exception of about three quarters of a mile measured from the Forks, was in Tilbury North. The only apparent interest which the Council of Tilbury North had which could explain their earnest solicitation of the Council of Tilbury West, to pass the by-law, and undertake the work therein mentioned, consisted in this, that all the lands in Tilbury North lying north of the line between the third and fourth concessions are low, wet, marsh lands called \u201cThe Plains,\u201d no part of which is anywhere more than three feet above the ordinary level of the Lake St. Clair. The waters of this lake rise gradually and periodically (and some times to a very great height) and again in like manner subside and rise again in such a manner that this rising and subsiding of the waters is in common language (although inaccurately) spoken of as a tide The broken front concession and the three adjoining concessions have always in every year been overflowed more or less by this rising of the waters of the lake, and in some years so as to leave only a mound of earth here and there visible. The ordinary level of Big Creek at a place called The Narrows in the centre of the third concession, and thence to its mouth, a distance of over three miles, is the same as the ordinary level of the lake. These low, wet, marsh lands, besides being exposed to being overflowed and drowned from this cause are also, in all times of freshets, exposed every year to further overflow from the waters of the River Thames, a large navigable river rushing down with great force and in large volume directly opposite to the mouth of Big Creek, thereby forcing the waters of the Thames up the Big Creek and up a large stream called Baptiste Creek, and up Tremblay Creek, and up another stream called Bruley Creek which three latter streams flow into Big Creek as it flows through those low, wet lands called \u201cThe Plains,\u201d and so also the waters flowing down all of those streams are penned back and made to spread over \u201cThe Plains\u201d where, uniting with the waters of the lake so as aforesaid overflowing the Plains, the combined waters keep the Plains continually flooded to a greater or less height until the waters of the lake subside and the force of the freshets have ceased. There is not, nor does there appear to have been supposed to be any possible mode of draining those lands either into Big Creek or otherwise, and there is said to be no possible mode of reclaiming them except by embankments made so as to enclose the parts to be reclaimed, and thus keep out the flood waters.\nWithin the last ten years many pieces of those lands have been reclaimed in this manner in Tilbury East along Baptiste Creek. Pumping has been used in some cases to get the water out of the parts enclosed by the embankments, but this is not essentially necessary. Since the Grand Trunk Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway have been con- structed across these \u201cPlains,\u201d the former in the broken front concession, and the latter in the second concession, their embankments which it has been necessary to construct to a height sufficient to enable the railway tracks to be laid above the flood waters, have served to be used as embankments in this reclaiming process. This is the unquestioned evidence as given by engineers who have been familiar with the condition of these \u201cPlains,\u201d for very many years. Mr. McDonald, an engineer, who designed some of the works completed by the Ontario Government in 1878, says that these embankments, together with the embankments constructed in the present scheme would afford perfect means of reclaiming all of the lands in the Plains if the railway companies would close the many passages kept open under the railways by which the flood waters pass up from the lake on to the \u201cPlains\u201d and back again when the lake subsides. He suggested this to the Grand Trunk Railway Company some years ago, but that company refused to concur in his suggestion through apprehension, as it would seem, that if the flood waters from the lake were prevented from passing under the railway, their force might destroy the railway embankment. A Mr. Holland has reclaimed a farm upon lot 16, in the first concession, about 1\u00bd miles west of Big Creek. He used the process of pumping to clear the water from his enclosure, but that is not requisite in all cases A Mr. Morris has reclaimed a farm in the third concession about half a mile east of Little Creek, and over a mile west of Big Creek. He has not made use of the pumping process but has availed himself of a railway embankment upon one side of his enclosure.\nNow the work designed by the said by-law no. 45 of Tilbury West to be done here, as appears by the engineer\u2019s report, which was made part of the by-law, was of the following description, namely:\nThat embankments should be made on each side of Big Creek proper from the Canada Southern Railway, that is to say, from where it crosses the line between the fourth and fifth concessions to the Grand Trunk Railway which crosses Big Creek about half a mile from its mouth, a distance of over six miles, and like embankments along Tremblay Creek from its junction with Big Creek on lot 19, in the first concession, to where the Canadian Pacific Railway crosses Tremblay Creek on lot 20, in the fourth concession. These embankments were to be made according to plans and specifications referred to in the report which was made part of the by-law and were to be of prescribed dimensions in height and width and of sufficient strength to prevent the waters of these two streams Big Creek and Tremblay Creek expanding over these low, wet lands called the Plains, of which, as the report says, there are 4,500 acres in Tilbury North which, as the report also says, will be greatly benefited by the embankments which were designed to prevent the overflow of water upon them from Big Creek and Tremblay Creek. That these lands would not only be greatly benefited, but that they would be the only lands deriving any benefit from this work which was designed to be constructed at a cost of $31,000 is the only conclusion reasonably to be deduced from the evidence. Now such a work, constructed along Big Creek and its affluent Tremblay Creek where the ordinary level of these streams is the same as the level of Lake St. Clair, cannot, in my opinion, be said with any propriety to be a drainage work at all or to be in any respect connected with the work done in Big Creek proper in 1878 between the Forks and the line between the third and fourth concessions at a cost as already stated of $5,983.32, nor can it be said, in my opinion, to come within the provisions of sec. 75 of 57 Vict. c. 56. The work so designed at a cost of $31,000 is nothing but a scheme for reclamation of drowned lands situate in such a low position as to be incapable of being drained, a work in fact of a character that has been in much use as a reclamation scheme on these plains within the last ten years, since the railway embankments were made across the plains. There is no novelty in the scheme, save only in attributing to it the character of a drainage work; that it does not come within the scope and intent of the section 75 appears to me to be clear for the reasons already given, and that it does not appears to be concluded by s.s. 2 of sec. 3 of 57 Vict. c. 56. It is said that the embankments under consideration here are not such embankments as that sub-section refers to, but no reason is suggested that I can see in support of such a contention. It is perfectly obvious that without the embankments the purpose for which they were designed, namely, of preventing the waters in the streams expanding over those low lands, could not be obtained. If the work can be considered to be a drainage work at all the embankments are essentially necessary to such work.\nThen the by-law wholly ignores the condition of the lands in Romney and the clauses of the Act in virtue of which the council of Tilbury West claims to have jurisdiction to affect those lands.\nThe lands in Romney are subject to whatever obligation has been imposed upon them, by 36 Vict. c, 38 and the award made thereunder in 1878, to maintain in repair the work done by the Ontario Government on the outlet of the drains in Romney into the natural watercourse of the East Branch stream, that is to say at the point where the Romney drains reached a sufficient fall to prevent injury to lands and roads. Whatever may be the extent of this obligation, the lands in Romney assessed in 1878 by the award then made are subject to it; but that obligation gives no jurisdiction whatever to the council of any of the townships through which Big Creek flows to charge lands in Romney for contribution to the cost of every work any one or more of such townships might undertake to construct anywhere along the course of Big Creek from its source in the township of Mersea to its mouth, a distance of eighteen or twenty miles. The obligation to maintain the work at the outlet of the Romney drains for which the lands in Romney were assessed by the award in 1878 can, I apprehend, be enforced against the council of Romney, and the owners of such lands, by any person claiming to suffer injury by neglect to repair and maintain. Whether the council of Tilbury West has jurisdiction suo motu, to determine when the work has fallen into such a condition as to require repair and to enforce the obligation upon the lands in Romney, cannot be judicially determined until such jurisdiction shall be asserted. It is sufficient at present to say that this is not a case of that description. When the case shall arise it will be time enough to determine what is the extent of the liability of the lands in Romney in view of the award made in 1878 under the provisions of 36 Vict. c. 38.\nThe engineer who made the report which is made part of the by-law has said in his evidence that the charges for \u201cinjuring liability\u201d and \u201coutlet liability\u201d which he has made upon the lands in Romney were made upon the principle of preventing injury to the low, wet lands above referred to; this was the only explanation he could, or at least did, offer for making those charges. He was asked to explain upon what principle he had proceeded in charging the lands in Romney thirty cents per acre as for \u201coutlet liability.\u201d To this inquiry he could not or, at least, did not give an answer save as above. It is not strange then, I think, that two engineers of considerable experience, one called as a witness for the plaintiff, and the other for the defendant in the action, Mr. McGeorge and Mr. Laird, should have said in their evidence that they could not see any ground whatever for any charge for \u201cinjuring liability\u201d in the present case. Referring to the definition of those terms, \u201cinjuring liability\u201d and \u201coutlet liability\u201d as given in the Act, and to the only obligation to which the lands in Romney were made liable by 36 Vict. c. 38, and the award thereunder, the council of Tilbury West had, I think, no more jurisdiction to charge lands in Romney for the work mentioned in the by-law, either for \u201cbenefit,\u201d or \u201cinjuring liability,\u201d or \u201coutlet liability\u201d than they had to charge lands in the Township of Dover at the opposite side of the River Thames.\nFor the reasons above given, I am of opinion that the appeal, in so far as it relates to the by\u2011law 601 of Romney, must be allowed with costs, and that judgment in the action must be ordered to be entered for the plaintiff with costs in so far as relates to the said by-law 601. The form of the judgment (being limited as was the action to the interests of the plaintiff, the now appellant) should be to the following effect:\nDeclare that the council of the municipality of Tilbury West had no jurisdiction to attempt to impose any charge, as they have assumed to do by the by-law 45, upon the lands in the pleadings mentioned, the property now of the appellant, viz., lots Nos. 21, 22 and 23 in the 5th concession, the South \u00bd of lot 21, lots 22, 23 and 26 in the 4th concession, and the North \u00bd, and the West \u00bd of the South \u00bd of lot 21, and the North \u00bd of lot 22, and the North \u00bd and the West \u00bd of the South \u00bd of lot 23 in the 3rd concession of the Township of Romney, in the County of Kent:\nRestrain the council of the Township of Romney from taking any steps or proceedings to enforce the by-law No. 601 of the Township of Romney against the said lands:\nDeclare that the registration of the said by-law is ineffectual and void and has imposed no lien upon the said lands in respect of the assessments in the said by-law assumed to be imposed.\nAS TO BY-LAW NO. 602.\nThere can be no doubt that the Council of the Township of Romney had jurisdiction to pass this by-law. It is nothing but a by-law to repair and maintain a drain constructed under the provisions of 36 Vict. ch. 39. Whether or not there has been any miscarriage in the proceedings taken under the provisions of the statute as regards such a by-law is not a matter open to inquiry in this action.\nIn so far, therefore, as relates to by-law no. 602, the appeal must be dismissed, but as the main, and indeed almost the whole contention in the appeal related to the by-law no. 601, and the costs of the appeal do not appear to have been increased by the contention as to the by\u2011law no. 602, the appeal, in so far as it relates to that by-law, is dismissed without costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs as to by-law 601; dismissed without costs as to by-law 602.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Geo.

Subsequently the St. Francis Mill Company recovered a judgment against the purchaser in an action in which the vendor was made a party whereby the purchaser was evicted from the dam property and the said company declared to be owner thereof.\nThe present action was then brought by the plaintiff to recover $20,000 damages on account of his eviction and the defendant's default to make good the title \u2022 and place him in possession of the dam property. The defendant denied any special agreement of warranty in regard to the dam property, alleged that the plaintiff was aware at the time of the sale of the causes which led to his eviction therefrom and tendered into court the full amount paid to him by the purchaser with costs as a sufficient indemnity under the provisions of Article 1512 of the Civil Code. It appeared that the sale had been made by the vendor in good faith believing himself to be the owner of all the property sold including the dam property, and that he had paid the costs in the action whereby the purchaser was evicted in addition to the amounts tendered by his plea.\nThe jugement of the trial court declared the tender sufficient and dismissed the action and the appeal is from the decision of the Court of Review affirming that judgment. The questions at issue on the present appeal sufficiently appear in the judgment reported.\nLafleur Q.C. and Cate for the appellant.\nPentland Q.C, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by;\nGIROUARD J.\u2014This is an action in damages resulting from the eviction of part of an immovable property which was sold by the respondent to the appellant \u201cwith warranty against all hindrances whatsoever.\"\nThe respondent met this action by alleging that at the time of the sale the appellant knew of the causes of the eviction but that there was no special agreement with regard to the same and that consequently he had a right to recover only the price of the thing sold, in accordance with Article 1522 of the Civil Code and he tendered him not only the vaine of the part he was evicted from font the total amount of the Price of the whole property sold with costs. Both the Superior Court and the Court of Review maintained this plea.\nThe appellant before this court contends for the first time that the above expressed warranty amounts to the \"special agreement\" mentioned in Article 1512 C. C. He quotes several French authorities to establish that when a warranty is stipulated, the vendor is bound to return the price and also to pay damages, but he admits that the French Code has no enactment corresponding to Article 1512 of the Quebec Code. We have no hesitation in holding that the \" special agreement \" referred to in Article 1512 is more than the conv\u00e9ntional warranty ; it is an agreement made with reference to the very cause or causes of the eviction which are known to the buyer The French version of Article 1512 of the code is perhaps more explicit than the English one.\nDans le cas de garantie (and this undoubtedly means conventional warranty) si l'acheteur avait connaissance, lors du contrat des causes d viction, et qu'il n'y ait eu aucune stipulation \u00e0 il ne peut alors r\u00e9clamer que le pix de la chose vendue.\nThe words \"\u00e0 cet \u00e9gard\" are not to foe found in the English version, but they are clearly understood.\nAs to the question of fact as to whether the appellant knew the causes of this eviction two courts have unanimously found against him and there is ample evidence to support that finding.\nThe appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cate Wells & White.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Caron, Pentland & Stuart.\n",

The pleas, in themselves also cumulative, alleged a title in the defendant, denied any title in the plaintiff, and, alleging that the plaintiff was merely a tenant, contended that he had no right to bring his action as proprietor of the lands.\nThe trial court, District of Kamouraska, decided that the plaintiff had failed in makings out title as owner of the lands, and, treating the action as petitory, dismissed it and vacated the interim injunction issued therein against the defendant. On appeal the Court of Review, at Quebec, affirmed the judgment of the trial court on the ground that the instrument on which the plaintiff based his title was not a conveyance of the lands which gave him the right to institute the action as owner, but merely an ordinary lease under which he held as tenant only and without having acquired any real rights therein.\nStuart Q.C for the appellants. The terms of the original lease operate as a conveyance or alienation for rent (Art. 1593 C. C.); the parties intended thereby to convey ownership as well as possession during the term and the instrument transferred tous les droits do jjouissance of the lesser who was thereby \" dessaisit \" of all ownership and possession, and the lessee \"saisit\" with both; 4 Aubry & Rau, no. 363, 365 (3); 2 Aubry & Ran, n. 189; Pothier, \" Louage,\" no. 3, 285; Bail \u00e0 Rente \" no. 3 14 35. 25 Demolombe n. 36; 6 Toullier, n. 320; Gity of Quebec v. North Shore Rail\" way Go. ([1]) at page 123.\nThe immediate title to the plaintiff, executed in 1885, is not an assignment of a lease, but actually a deed of sale of the property which constitutes a separate title under this conveyance by the executors of the former lessee to him \u201cof all the dams built on both sides of the river.\" At the time of this sale, the executors were in possession. The respondent never had any possession, and is himself without title, while plaintiff has a title under which he has had bond fide possession and public enjoyment from 1885 till the trespass complained of in 1899, and has acquired prescriptive rights. See Pothier, \u201cDomaine de Propri\u00e9t\u00e9,\" nn. 292, 293 322 324 325; Lep\u00e8re v. Leprovost ([2]); Commune de Lally v. Commune de Preboss ([3]).\nThe Court of Review held that the right to a special action even as tenants belonged to the plaintiff by reason of his dispossession by the defendant, and that such right could not be enforced because the plaintiff had sued as proprietor and not as a tenant. But the rule is that misdescription, either of the remedy or of right claimed, cannot vitiate proceedings, provided no substantial injustice be done. None could be done in this case because the title was fully set out and the plaintiff was entitled to such remedy as the title disclosed. The granting of the injunction and the order for restorations of possession were rights which belonged to the plaintiff, whichever way his title be interpreted. Art. 567 C. C; Cossit v. Lemieux ([4]). The defence waived any objections to the cumulative form of the action by filing cumulative pleas; (Art. 177, (6) C.P.Q.), and we are entitled to have the \"Possessory conclusions in case our petitory claim should be rejected. Gerbeau v. Blais ([5]) ; McGee v. Larochells ([6]).\nL. A. Taschereau for the appellant. As to prescription, it has not been pleaded and cannot now be invoked even if there was such a title in the plaintiff as might support such a contention. Arts. 2208, 2244 C C, Gibson v. Wear ([7]). The plaintiff's auteurs held only under an ordinary lease of lands for an extended term without any clause conveying real rights therein, and they could not transfer more than the rights they possessed as tenants. The plaintiff became merely a sub-tenant under the deed of 1885. Although called a bail emphyt\u00e9otique, this original instrument does not affect the land, it merely hypothecates improvements, and has none of the characteristics either of empty\u2014 teusis or of a bail \u00e0 rente or bail d Iongues ann\u00e9es. 4 Pothier (ed.

Par sa d\u00e9claration, le demandeur appelant all\u00e9guant et titres et possession, et concluant et au p\u00e9titoire et au possessoire, r\u00e9clame la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et la possession d'un certain lopin de terre situ\u00e9 en la Paroisse des Trois-Pistoles.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur intim\u00e9, loin de prendre objection au cumul \u00e9vident de l'action du demandeur \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame cumul\u00e9 par sa defense et a plaid\u00e9 lui aussi et titres et possession. Les parties ont r\u00e9ciproquement produit leurs titres et fait une longue enqu\u00eate sur la question de possession.\nL'appelant ne pout r\u00e9ussir.

Il ne peut donc en \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire, et le jugement qui le d\u00e9boute de ses conclusions au p\u00e9titoire est inattaquable. Il a \u00e9mis devant cette cour la proposition que le bail originaire sur lequel il appuie ses pr\u00e9tendions est un bail \u00e0 rente transmissible de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais cette proposition n'est pas fond\u00e9e. Cee bail n'est que pour seize ans, et il n'y a que le bail \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 et le bail emphyt\u00e9otique qui soient \u00e9quivalents \u00e0 la vente. Arts. 567 572 1593 C. C.\nL'appelant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 un acte de vente du 17 novembre 1885 par lequel il appert avoir achet\u00e9 un terrain qui, d'apr\u00e8s lui couvre la localit\u00e9 en litige mais ce document ne peut supporter son action p\u00e9titoire, vu qu'\u00e0 sa face m\u00eame, les vendeurs n'avaient d'autre titre a la possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que le bail originaire. Cet acte a constitue l'appelant sous-locataire, et voil\u00e0 tout. Ses vendeurs n'ont Pu lui transf\u00e9rer un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 quillas n'avaient pas. Et ii s'est d'ailleurs reconnu n'\u00eatre que locataire en payant depuis le loyer annuel convenu par le bail.\nMais, nous a dit l'appelant, si je ne puis r\u00e9ussir an p\u00e9titoire, je dois du moins r\u00e9ussir au possessive, et obtenir, m\u00eame si je ne suis que locataire, un jugement en r\u00e9int\u00e9grande, sans adjuger sur le p\u00e9titoire.

The provisions of the Married Woman's Property Acts affecting the question as set out in the judgment.\nMellish for the appellant. The note is not a contract between the parties such as is prohibited by the statute. It is in the hands of the plaintiff a chose in action. Independent of the statutes relating to the property of married women, a married woman was capable of having a chose in action conferred on her. The indorsement of the note was an assignment of a chose in action and it belonged to the wife so long as the husband did not reduce it into possession. See Williams on Executors (9 ed.) pp. 739 and 798; also Fleet v. Perrins[1], per Blackburn J. at p. 541-2,(1868), decided before the earliest Married Woman's Property Act; Datton y. Midland Counties Railway Co.[2]; Gates v. Madeley[3], per Parke B. at page 427; Richards v. Richards[4]; Sherrington v. Yates[5]; Anson on Contracts (7 ed,) p. 120; Eversley on Domestic Relations, p. 198.\nThis is property within the meaning of sec. 3 of ch. 94 R. S. N. S. (5 ser.) acquired when that statute was in force. The effect of the Act of 1898 was to make the plaintiff discovert, and enable her to sue her husband notwithstanding the note was indorsed to her long before its passage. Eversley 334, 424; Weldon v. Winslow[6]; Woodward v. Woodward[7]; Lowe v. Fox[8]; Lush, Husband and Wife at p. 463; Weldon v. Neat[9]; Weldon v. DeBathe[10]; Severance v. Civil Service Supply Association[11]; James v. Barraud[12]; Butler v. Butler[13]; Spooner v. Spooner[14]; Buss v. George[15].\nBorden Q. C. for the respondent. The plaintiff claims as indorsee against the maker. The action is ex contractu upon an implied promise arising from the fact of the plaintiff being the holder of a promissory note made by defendant. Stephens on Pleading (7 ed.) p. 11; 1 Comyns Digest, p. 284, 290; 1 Saunders on Pleading & Evidence (2 ed.) pp. 162, 447; Bullen & Leak's Precedents on Pleading (3 ed.) p. 94.\nBy the statute 3 & 4 Anne ch. 9, the indorsee is given the same right of action against the maker as the indorsee of a bill of exchange had by the custom of merchants against the acceptor and the same implied promise exists between indorsee and maker of a promissory note as between indorsee and acceptor of a bill of exchange. Welsh v. Craig[16]; Bishop v. Young[17]; Powell v. Ancell[18].\nBetween husband and wife at common law there could be no contract express or implied because they are one person. 1 Chit. Black, p. 442; Crawley on Husband and Wife, pp. 28, 29; Phillips v. Barnet[19]; Cahill v. Cahill[20]. This is the principle upon which conveyances from husband to wife are held to be void. Co. Litt. 112 a.; Re Breton[21]; Bliss v. Aetna Life Ins. Co.[22]. The result is that at common law the indorsement gave the plaintiff no cause of action against her husband, but the note when indorsed to her became extinguished. Haley v. Lane[23]; In re Price[24]; Jackson v. Parks[25]; Gay v. Kingsley[26]; Chapman v. Kellogg[27]; Abbott v. Winchester[28]; Roby v. Phelon[29].\nBoth the Nova Scotia and Ontario Acts are like the English Married Woman's Property Act, 1882, and the Massachusetts Act; they do not do away with the unity of husband and wife but only remove certain specific disabilities of the wife leaving all others untouched. Butler v. Butler[30], per Willes J. at page 835; Lord v. Parker[31]; Edwards v. Stevens[32]; Ingham v. White[33].\nThe Ontario and Nova Scotia Acts referred to created in married women no contractual capacity whatever. Moore v. Jackson[34]; Foster v. Hartlen[35]; Neither does the New Brunswick Act. Wallace v. Lea[36].\nThere is a further ground as to the claim for interest, that inasmuch as plaintiff and defendant were living together as man and wife during all the time for which interest is claimed and plaintiff was receiving money from defendant from time to time, their transactions are of a character that it is impossible to go into to find out how much of the interest he has paid, and therefore none should be allowed.\nWe refer also to Fitzgerald v. Fitzgerald[37]; Turnbull v. Foram[38]; Conolan v. Ley land[39]; In re Roper Roper v. Doncaster[40]; Weldonv. DeBathe[41].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The plaintiff, appellant, is the wife of the defendant, respondent, and sues her husband upon a promissory note, dated 6th June, 1892, for $1,000, made by the husband and payable on demand to the order of one Jenny Levi, who gave valuable consideration therefor. Jenny Levi subsequently indorsed the note to her sister, the plaintiff, as a present. It is admitted that the whole transaction as between all parties was a perfectly bond fide one, and the only question in controversy in this suit is whether or not the plaintiff, being the defendant's wife, can recover on the note in question.\nAt the time of the making of the note section three of chapter 94 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 5th series, was in force. It is as follows:\u2014\nEvery married woman who shall have married before the nineteenth day of April, 1884, without any marriage contract or settlement, shall and may, from and after the said date, notwithstanding her coverture, have, hold and enjoy all her real estate, not on or before such date taken possession of by her husband, by himself or his tenants, and all her personal property, not on or before such date reduced into possession of her husband, whether such real estate or personal property shall have belonged to her before marriage or shall have been in any way acquired by her after marriage, otherwise than from her husband, free from his debts and obligations contracted after such date, and from his control or disposition without her consent, in as full and ample a manner as if she were sole and unmarried.\nSection 81. Nothing herein contained shall authorise any married woman to make a contract with her husband otherwise than in this chapter expressly mentioned. * * *\nThis chapter 94 and subsequent Acts on the subject of married women's property were by chapter 22 of the Acts of 1898 consolidated and amended; secs. 12 and 23 being as follows:\n12. Every woman, whether married before or after this Act, shall have, in her own name, against all persons whomsoever, including her husband, the same civil remedies, and also (subject as regards her husband to the proviso hereinafter contained,) the same remedies and redress by way of criminal proceedings, for the protection and security of her own separate property, as if such property belonged to her as a feme sole, but, except as aforesaid, no husband or wife shall be entitled to sue the other for a tort. * * *\n23. The Married Woman's Property Act, 1884, and the Acts in amendment thereof are hereby repealed; provided that such repeal shall not affect any act done or right acquired while such acts were in force, or any right or liability of any husband or wife, married before the commencement of this Act, to sue, or be sued under the provisions of the said repealed Acts or either of them, for or in respect of any debt, contract, wrong or other matter or thing whatsoever, for or in respect of which any such right or liability shall have accrued to or against such husband or wife before the commencement of this Act.\nThe case was tried before Mr. Justice Ritchie, who gave judgment for the husband, and his judgment was sustained by an equally divided court, the Chief Justice and Weatherbe J. dissenting.\nTwo questions arise, first, whether section 81 of ch. 94, above quoted applies to the case in question; and secondly, if it does not whether section twelve of the Act of 1898, can be taken advantage of in order to sustain the action.\nUpon the first point Mr; Justice Ritchie held, as I understand him, that the plaintiff could not succeed, inasmuch as her claim was based entirely upon the contract specified in the promissory note or, in other words, that there was some contractual obligation between the wife and the husband in respect of it, and that in consequence her right to succeed was shut out by her incapacity to make a contract with her husband as provided in section eighty-one, above referred to.\nThis, I respectfully submit, is a fundamental error in the judgment appealed from. Section three gave her a right to hold and enjoy all her personal property, whether acquired before marriage or after marriage otherwise than from her husband. There can be no doubt but that the note in question is property, and that it had not been reduced into possession by the husband. It was, therefore, as much hers as if it had been a chattel, and she had a right to deal with it as the statute says \"in as full and ample a manner as if she were sole and unmarried.\" Is she prevented from enforcing it because at common law she could not enforce it against her husband? Or because she is prohibited by chapter 94 from making a contract with her husband?\nIn my judgment, she is not. There is not here, in my view, any contractual relationship between the husband and the wife. The contract is between the maker and the payee only and the wife's right depends, not upon any promise made to her or on her behalf by the husband, or upon any contractual relationship between the two, but upon other principles altogether.\nNow, it is elementary that as a general rule no one can recover in an action ex contractu except a person who is a party to the contract or his representative. There must in every case be privity of contract, a promise made by the defendant to the plaintiff. Even if that promise is to pay money to a third person or to do something for the benefit of that third person, it is settled that that third person cannot sue on the contract, he not being the promisee See Tweedle v. Atkinson[42].\nAnd this principle has been laid down over and over again in this court as well as in England. Cleaver v. Mutual Reserve Fund[43]; Guerin v. Manchester Fire Assurance Co.[44] at page 150.\nThere are, of course, exceptions to the rule, the most important exception being the case of Bills of Exchange, which, by the law merchant, were excluded from the operation of the principle. Promissory notes, as everybody knows, did not come within the operation of the law merchant, and the statute 3 & 4 Anne, ch. 9, was passed for that purpose. Covenants running with the land may be considered as forming another exception, and now, in most of the provinces of Canada as well as in England, all contracts are assignable and the assignee may sue thereon in his own name. But the maker of a promissory note makes his contract with the payee alone. It is by virtue of the statute of Anne, and subsequent legislation, and not by virtue of the contract, that a holder other than the payee is entitled to sue upon it. Although the action is an action ex contractu, the plaintiff obtains his title to sue upon the contract, not by virtue of a promise made to him, but of a promise made to the payee, which promise enures to his benefit as a legal consequence of the indorsation of the instrument to him by the payee or by any other indorser. It seems to me then clear that section 81 of chapter 94. does not apply to the present case. Upon the other ground Mr. Justice Ritchie stated that:\nIf the Married Woman's Property Act, 1898, were in force, it would probably remove all the plaintiff's difficulties; but it has no application to this promissory note, the title to which accrued to the plaintiff, if at all, long before the commencement of that Act.\nThe Act referred to was passed before the institution of this action and, in my judgment, the plaintiff could avail herself of its provisions, notwithstanding that it was passed after the making of the note. Section 12 gives her, in express terms, in her own name, the right to sue her husband, and section 23 would seem to admit that even previously she had that right under the original Act.

P. R. Co. from \u201call municipal taxes, rates and levies and assessments of every nature and kind.\u201d\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Queers Bench, (12 Man. L. R. 581), that the exemption included school taxes.\nThe by-law also provided for the issue of debentures to the company, and by an Act of the Legislature, 46 & 47 Vict. ch. 64, it was provided that by-law 148 authorising the issue of debentures granting by way of bonus to the C. P. R. Co. the sum of $200,000 in consideration of certain undertakings on the part of the said company; and by-law 195 amending by-law No. 148 and extending the time for the completion of the undertaking * * * be and the same are hereby declared legal, binding and valid. * * *\nHeld, that notwithstanding the description of the by-law in the Act was confined to the portion relating to the issue of debentures the whole by-law including the exemption from taxation, was validated. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Manitoba ([1]) affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe question for decision on the appeal was whether or not the railway company was liable to be assessed for school rates by the city. The company claimed to be exempt under a by-law of the city validated by an Act of the legislature. The city claimed that the exemption in the by-law did not cover school taxes, and also that the portion of the by-law creating the exemption was not validated.\nThe material parts of the by-law and of the validating Act are set out in the above head-note, and in the judgment of the court.\nAylesworth Q.C. and Atkins Q.C. for the appellant.\nHowell Q.C. and Chrysler Q.C for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The original design of the Canadian Government in fulfilment of its obligations with British Columbia and of its successor in the enterprise, the present appellant company, contemplated the crossing of the Red River by the railway at Selkirk, some thirty miles down the river from the City of Winnipeg, thence westerly by the North Saskatchewan Valley, through the Yellow Head Pass of the Rocky Mountains and on to the Pacific Ocean. The City of Winnipeg, a few years before created by the legislature of the province a municipality, was anxious that the main line of the railway should pass through the city limits, and was prepared to offer very great inducements to secure that end. An agreement was consequently entered into between the city and the company, which was afterwards embodied in a by-law passed by the city council on the 5th of September, 1881. This by-law, after various recitals, wherein it was declared that a line of railway south westerly from Winnipeg towards the westerly limit of Manitoba, through the Pembina Mountain district, should be built; that it was desirable to secure the location of the workshops and stock-yards of the company at Winnipeg as a central point on the main line of the railway; that the company had agreed to construct such railway and to establish and continue their principal shops and stock-yards for the Province in Winnipeg; and further, that it was expedient for the city, in consideration of the premises to grant to the company, by way of bonus, debentures to the amount of two hundred thousand dollars with interest\nand to exempt the property now owned or hereafter to be owned by the said Tail way company for railway purposes within the City of Winnipeg from taxation for ever,\nenacted as follows:\nUpon the fulfilment by the said company of the conditions and stipulations herein mentioned by the said Canadian Pacific Railway Company, all property now owned or that hereafter may be owned by them within the limits of the City of Winnipeg for railway purposes, or in connection therewith, shall be forever free and exempt from all municipal taxes, rates and levies and assessments of every nature and kind.\nThe company, within the proper time, carried out its part of the contract, the city doing the same, but inasmuch as there was a grave question as to whether the by-law above recited and a subsequent by-law, No. 195, slightly amending it, were intra vires of the city corporation, the Legislature of Manitoba, by chapter 64 of the Acts of 1883, passed an Act validating these by-laws, the enacting, words being in part:\nBy-law No. 148 * * * and by-law No. 195, amending it, * * * are hereby declared legal, binding and valid. The chief question arising upon this appeal is as to the extent of the exempting privileges created by the by-law as confirmed by the Act of 1883. In other words, is the exemption sufficiently wide to embrace the moneys raised by the City of Winnipeg for public school purposes ? Are school taxes included in the phrase \u201c municipal taxes, rates and levies and assessments of every nature and kind ?\u201d\nA question was discusssd at the argument as to whether the Act validating the by-law in question really made valid the exemption clause. I entertain no doubt upon this point. The whole and every part of the by-law was in express words confirmed, and it would be in violation of the plain meaning and express words of the enactment to hold otherwise. Exemption from taxation was as much a bonus to the company, as perhaps a larger one than, the two hundred thousand dollars issue of debentures, and it might just as well be argued that the Act, while validating the exemption, did not validate the debenture issue.\nThe main question, therefore, is this: Does the exemption include school taxes ?\nIn order to reach a conclusion on the point in question, it will be well shortly to state the statute law in force in relation to common schools and to the authority of the municipal council in respect to taxation for public schools at the date of the passing of the bylaw, inasmuch as the contracting parties must have had before their minds the then existing state of the law applicable both to the school corporation and to the city. The school trustees of the City of Winnipeg were incorporated before the incorporation of the city, and at first they were given statutory authority not only to impose school taxes but also to collect them. See the Act of 1876, (39 Vict. ch. 1, secs. 11 and 15).\nThis latter section (sec. 15), however provided as follows: In case the boards of school trustees of cities and towns deem it advisable so to do, they may make out an estimate of the sum required in any year for educational purposes, and on or before the first day of March in each and every year, they shall provide the clerk of the city or town with such estimate accompanied with a list of the names of the persons liable to be assessed for the support of the public school or schools of which the board applying are the trustees, and it shall be the duty of the council of such city or town to levy and collect the amount demanded with the corporation taxes and to pay over the same to the boards of school trustees when collected, or the council may from time to time advance to the boards of school trustees within their municipalities, any sum or sums which they may think proper, pending the collection of the school taxes; provided that nothing in this Act shall prevent the boards of school trustees from levying and collecting the school rates and taxes themselves, if they should think proper so to do.\nThat section was re-enacted in the school Act in force when the by-law was passed, (44 Vict. ch. 44, sec. 51), except in regard to the proviso at the end, which was eliminated, so that when the by-law was passed the school trustees of the city had no power to tax for school purposes. That duty was imposed, and wholly imposed, upon the municipal authorities. There were still left in the statute traces and indications that at a previous period the collection of school taxes was with the school trustees, and section fifty-one of the Act just referred to would seem to indicate that it was a matter of choice with the trustees whether they should collect the taxes or employ the civic machinery for that purpose, but their power of collection was gone, and in the case of the Winnipeg School Trustees v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. ([2]), Chief Justice Sir Thomas Taylor says, at page 166:\nIt is true that the fifty-first section of the Act now in force only says that an estimate is to be made out and sent to the council \u201cif the board of trustees deem it advisable so to do,\u201d but practically the Legislature has given them Hobson\u2019s choice in the matter. If they do not deem it advisable so to do, the statutes do not, so far as I can find, confer upon them any power to assess, levy or collect taxes themselves, and they must go without a revenue.\nThe law, therefore, at the date of the by-law, would seem to be this: The school trustees had the right of determining without question the amount which was to be raised for public school purposes within the city limits and of authoritatively calling upon the city authorities to collect and hand over that amount, while, the latter authorities were under an absolute obligation to obey the behests, in that regard, of the school trustees.\nIt may be well, too, here to state that the municipal council had legislative authority to pass by-laws\nfor encouraging manufactures within the limits of the city, by exempting from taxation, in the whole or in part, for a period of one or more years, such industrial establishments as are now or may hereafter be carried on in said city, and which, in the public interests, may by said council seem advisable. (38 Vict. ch. 50, sec. 107, as amended by 42 Vict. ch. 4, sec. 20.)\nAlso for granting bonuses to any railway or bridge company (sec. 4, ch. 42); 44 Vict. ch. 21 (1881) enacted that it should be lawful for any incorporated city\nto exempt from all taxes assessments and Municipal imposts whatsoever for a period not exceeding twenty years any manufactory. * * *\nIt is evident from these statutes that the city had, at the time of the passing of the by-law, the power to exempt property from taxation for certain purposes, and I do not doubt but that these powers were before the minds of the contracting parties at the time the by-law was passed, as well as the general law in regard to the collection of school taxes.\nThe question then is: Are schools taxes exempt under this phrase \u201c exempt from all municipal taxes, rates and levies and assessments of every nature and kind?\u201d\nApart from the main inquiry, the words themselves are not altogether free from ambiguity. I think, according to the rules of grammatical expression, the adjective \u201cmunicipal\u201d applies only to \u201ctaxes, rates and levies,\u201d and does not qualify \u201cassessments.\u201d If the first conjunction \u201cand\u201d were not there, the adjective would qualify \u201c assessments,\u201d but it is there, and, according to the literal construction of the sentence the property is exempt not only from all \u201cmunicipal taxes, rates and levies.\u201d but also from \u201cassessments of every nature and kind.\u201d If this literal construction is to be given, and I think it should be given, the case is at an end.\nBut we much prefer to rest our judgment upon the main ground that municipal taxes include school taxes, and that the property of the company is exempt from any liability to contribute towards the support of the city schools.\nMr. Justice Bain, in his judgment in this case, states as follows \u0e30\nThe widest definition I could give to the expression \u201c municipal taxes \u201d would be that they are taxes imposed by the governing body of a municipality for the purposes of the municipality.\nAnd this definition is approved of by Killam C.J.\nI accept this definition. Taxes imposed for the support of schools in a municipality, in my view, are taxes for the purposes of the municipality. The promotion of education in a community is as much a municipal purpose as the promotion of health in a community, or of physical training, or of any other object having in view the well being of the citizens. Many cities have statutory authority to impose taxes for the support of hospitals, or public libraries, gymnasiums and athletic associations of all kinds. Are these any more municipal purposes than education? There is not, in my view, any difference in principle between them.\nThere is another view, however, which so far has not been put forward. I submit that any taxation by a municipal body for the purpose of raising money to relieve itself from a municipal obligation, is taxation for a municipal purpose. The obligation of imposing this tax and of collecting it was one of the city\u2019s legislative burdens. Relief from that burden must therefore necessarily be a municipal purpose, and the moneys raised therefor a municipal tax.\nWith the greatest possible deference, we have come to the conclusion that the judgment appealed from is wrong.\nThe appeal will be allowed with costs in all the courts and the action dismissed.\nOwing to illness, the Chief Justice was prevented taking part in the judgment of the court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J. A. M. Aikins.\nSolicitor for the respondent: John Stanley Hough.\n[1] 12 Man. L. R. 581.\n[2] 2 Man. L. R. 163.\n",

They then brought action against G. in which evidence was given, not produced in the former case that the shares once held by G. had been transferred to H., but were not registered in the company's books. On this evidence the court below gave judgment in favour of G.\nHeld, affirming such judgment, that the shares were duly transferred to H. though not registered, as it appeared that H. had acted for some time as president of, and executed documents for the company, and the only way he could have held shares entitling him to do so was by transfer from G.\nHeld, also, that although there appeared to be a failure of justice from the result of the two actions, the inability of the plaintiffs to prove their case against H. in the first could not affect the rights of G. in the subsequent suit.\nThe company in which G. held stock was incorporated in 1886 and empowered to build a certain line of railway. In 1890 an Act was passed intituled \"An Act to consolidate and amend\" the former company, but authorising additional works to be constructed, increasing the capital stock, appointing an entirely different set of directors, and giving the company larger powers. One clause repealed all Acts and parts of Acts inconsistent therewith. G. had transferred his shares before the later Act came into force. The judgment against the company was recovered in 1895.\nHeld, that G. was never a shareholder of the company against whom such judgment was obtained.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the above head-note.\nCahan for the appellants. The evidence fully supports the finding of the trial judge that J. E. Dickie was an original shareholder for five hundred shares in the Stewiacke Valley & Lansdowne Railway Co. which were validly transferred to Donald Grant in September, 1887, in the form required by R. S. N. S. (5 ser.) ch. 53, sec. 22, and, though no entry thereof was made in the transfer-book Grant became the legal owner and holder of the shares; Spackman v. Evans[1] at page 238; Nanney v. Morgan[2]; because all necessary conditions had been fulfilled to give him an absolute and unconditional right to have the transfer entered in the books of the company. Roots v. Williamson[3]; Moore v. Northwestern Bank[4]; Powell v. London and Provincial Bank[5], at page 799; and further, the resolution by the directors in September, 1887, approving and accepting the transfer to Grant is a sufficient entry on the books of the company.\nIf Grant did not become a legal shareholder, the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment against the estate of Dickie, as holder of the shares. Even admitting Holmes had an agreement or transfer from Grant, giving him an equitable right to the shares, nevertheless such equitable right did not constitute Holmes a legal shareholder as the company did not approve and accept him as a shareholder or, if in this company shareholders may transfer shares at will, unless and until such transfer had been brought to the notice of the company, as provided by secs. 22, 23, ch. 53, R. S. N. S. (5 ser.) by being filed with the directors. Copeland v. North Eastern Railway Co.[6]; The Queen v. General Cemetery Co.[7].\nThis company created by statute is not a corporation at common law, and common law rules as to transfers of shares do not apply; see remarks by Bowen L.J. in Baroness Wenlock v. River Dee Co.[8], in the note at page 684. The statutory provisions with respect to sales and transfers of shares must be complied with in order to make an effectual transfer as against creditors. In re Wrysgan Slate Quarrying Co., Humby's Case[9]. A person once a shareholder remains so unless he has in some lawful way got rid of his liability. See remarks by Gifford L. J. in Re Patent Paper Mfg. Co., Addison's Case[10], at p. 297; Buckley on Companies (7 ed.) at pp. 44, 148. There is no evidence that the alleged transfer from Grant to Holmes was accepted or received by the transferees or either of them, or filed with the directors, or even brought to their notice.\nThe contention that the company sued is not the company organized by ch. 155 of 1886, in which Grant and Dickie were shareholders, but another company incorporated by ch. 63, of 1890, is not open to the respondents, because the 1st and 2nd paragraphs of the claim are not specifically denied in the defence, and must be taken as admitted. It has no foundation, in fact, inasmuch as both statutes apply to one and the same company:\u2014the Stewiacke Valley and Lansdowne Ry. Co., incorporating Act, ch. 155 of 1886, was amended by ch. 84 of 1888, authorized by the company, and the Act, ch. 63 of 1890, was a consolidation of the original Act, and amendments. The contention that the plaintiffs have recovered no judgment against the S. V. and L. Ry. Co., because it had ceased to exist when the judgment was recovered is not now open to the defendants as the 1st paragraph of the claim is admitted. The defendants are estopped from raising any question in this action as to the validity of the judgment or the existence of the corporation. Lindley on Companies (5 ed.) pp. 283, 284; Ray v. Blair[11]; Casey v. Galli[12].\nAs to the contention that ten per cent on the capital was not expended within three years, and that the corporate existence ceased under R. S. N. S. (5 ser.), ch. 53, s. 27 s.s. 6, \"ten per cent on the capital\" does not mean ten per cent of the capital. By sec. 2, ch. 155 of 1886, the capital was fixed at $160,000; by sec. 6, ch. 84 of 1888, the capital was increased to $400,000; by sec. 6, ch. 63 of 1890, the capital of $400,000 was confirmed, and the evidence is that $40,000 and over was expended before 31st, December 1889. Chapter 53 does not apply to this company when inconsistent with the special act; and sub-sec. 6 of sec. 27 is expressly varied by sec. 16 of ch. 155 of 1886. The words \"null and void\" there should be construed as \"voidable;\" and the charter could only be annulled in a direct proceeding by the Attorney-General. New York and Long Island Bridge Co. v. Smith[13]; Hardy Lumber Co. v. Pickerel River Improvement Co.,[14]. The corporate existence was recognized after the alleged expiration of the charter by ch. 63 of 1890; ch. 87 of 1892; and even if the charter had expired it is no defence to a creditor's action such as this. Ray v. Blair[15]; Edwards v. Kilkenney and G. S. & W. Railway Co.[16]; City of Toronto & Lake Huron Railroad Co. v. Crookshank[17], at p. 317.\nThe appellants are entitled to recover from the estate of Grant, or in the alternative from the estate of Dickie.\nMellish for the respondents, Grants. Grant's name was never entered in the books as shareholder, and the pretended transfer to him was void because a previous call had not been paid at the time. If he ever could be considered a shareholder, he ceased to be so in 1887, when he transferred to Holmes, who was then president of the company, received the transfer and handed it to the secretary whose duty it was to keep the records and make the proper entries. Holmes qualified upon these shares, and Grant is not shewn to have been at a meeting or taken any interest in the company. See Page v. Austen[18].\nIf Grant was a shareholder it was in the company incorporated by the Act of 1886, which for the reasons given by Townshend J. ceased to exist when the Act of 1890 was passed. The judgment was null and void, because that company had ceased to exist under sec. 27 (R. S. N S., 5 ser., ch. 53) of the Railway Act, not having expended 10 per cent of its capital stock on the construction of the railway, (a) within three years after the passing of the Act of 1.886, or (b) within three years after the passing of the Act of 1890. Sturges v. Vanderbilt[19]; In re Brooklyn, W. & N. R. Co.[20]; In re Brooklyn, W. & N. R. Co.[21].\nNew combe Q.C. for the other respondents, executors of J. E. Dickie. Mr. Justice Ritchie, at the trial, found that in September, 1887, the late James E. Dickie made a valid and effectual transfer to Grant. The executors of Dickie rely upon the reasons of Townshend J. for the holding that Grant made a valid transfer in which Meagher J. concurred. If Grant made a valid transfer, a fortiori, Dickie did. We further rely upon the argument of Weatherbe J. that he who can be said to be \"the holder of the said stock\" is the person liable. Under the words of the statute the holder is liable for \"the stock held by him.\" The question is not who has registered or delivered or of filing and registration but who holds the stock or in other words owns it. Dickie ceased to be the \"holder of the stock\" when he executed a transfer and delivered it both to Grant and to the company to be registered. He did everything in his power to divest himself of the stock. The minute of the resolution accepting Grant as a shareholder was a literal compliance with sec. 155. At the time of the transfer there was no legal call outstanding, all calls were satisfied, and sec. 20 of the N. S. Ry., Act, under which an alleged call was made, has no application between shareholders and creditors, but only as between shareholders and the company. The call in question was not legal because thirty days' notice was not given by publication, and the resolution did not appoint a place and time for payment as required by R. S. N. S. (5 ser.) ch. 53, sec. 20.\nIt is not open to the appellants as creditors of the company to take the objection that a call was unpaid at the time of the transfer from Dickie to Grant, the directors accepted Grant as a shareholder in place of Dickie; that ended the matter; the creditors cannot complain. Ex parte Littledale[22]. Any irregularity was waived by the company and the transferee; the transferee was recognized and treated by the company as the holder of the shares; and both company and transferee acted upon the transfer as valid and effectual. The non-entry was only an irregularity and was waived. Straffon's Executors' Case[23]; Murray v. Bush[24]; In re Manchester and Oldham Bank[25]; Royal Bank of Indian Case[26];Sheffield, etc. Railway Co., v. Woodcock[27].\nFor the reasons given by Townshend J. in the court below we contend that the company in which Dickie took stock ceased to exist and a new company was incorporated with the same name. It is against the new company and not the company of which Dickie was a member that the appellants recovered the judgment upon which this action was founded. The charter expired under sec. 9, ch. 78, R. S. N. S. (5 ser.), and nothing has been done under secs. 10 and 11 to revive it.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Townshend in so far as they relate to the ownership of the shares in question. It appears to me that the evidence conclusively establishes that Mr. Holmes and his associates, and not the defendants Grant, were owners of the shares, the calls upon which this action seeks to enforce. It would seem that an action had been brought against him which failed in consequence of what the court thought to be insufficient proof of a transfer to him of the shares, but that defect in the present case was fully removed by the evidence of Mr. McGillivray, evidence upon which the trial judge acted and which the appellate court accepted to the fullest possible extent. At first blush it would seem that in this case there is a failure of justice inasmuch as both the original shareholders, and the two subsequent transferees have escaped liability. It is rather, however, a failure of evidence to meet the exigencies of a particular case, a failure for which the plaintiff himself must, in the present case, be held responsible. His misfortune in not being able to prove his case in the first action must not affect the rights of the defendants in the second, or tempt a court of justice to sacrifice them on that account.\nOne other observation may be made. There was no express evidence that the transfer from Grant to Holmes was approved by the company, or that the latter's name was ever upon any list of shareholders. In my view, we must assume, under the special circumstances of this case that the transfer was approved, and that the list existed. Almost all the immediate parties connected with the transaction are dead, except Mr. Holmes, who appears to possess a very defective, if also a very convenient memory, but Mr. Holmes was the principal officer of the company; general meetings of the company without number were presided over by him as president of the company; for several years he was its principal executive officer, and is still, so far as I know. The only title which he had to interest himself in the affairs of the company or to act as director or president, or to execute the mortgages and bonds referred to in the evidence, was based and depended upon the transfer of Grant to him. In fact the plaintiff's rights to obtain his original judgment against the company were in effect based upon the assumption that Mr. Holmes was a shareholder, because it was by virtue of the company's contracts executed by him that their rights arose. Under the circumstances the maxim omnia pr\u0153sumuntur rite esse acta applies. I have also considered Mr. Justice Townshend's view in regard to the identity of the defendant company in the plaintiff's original action against it, and entirely agree with it. Neither Dickie nor Grant was ever a shareholder in the new company.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Harris, Henry & Cahan.\nSolicitor for the respondents, the Grants: John McGillivray.\nSolicitors for the respondents, the Dickies: Drysdale & McInnis\n[1] L.

R. 9 Q. B. 142) reversed \"judgment of the Superior Court, (Q. R. 15 S. C. 43) restored; Gwynne J. dissenting. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Province of Quebec, appeal side ([1]), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal ([2]), which dismissed the respondent's petition to -set aside an assessment roll for the cost of widening a street in the City of Montreal.\nUnder the provisions of \"The Charter of the City Montreal l the commissioners named in 1891 for the purposes of expropriations and assessments necessary for the widening of a portion of Notre-Dame Street reported, in April, 1892, as to expenses in connection with the works and their report was duly homologated by the court. In June, 1893, their assessment roll apportioning the cost of the improvement between the city and riparian proprietors was confirmed and deposited in the City Treasurer's Office for collection all in conformity with 55 & 56 Vict. chap. 49, s. 22. In January, 1894, the Act 57 Vict. chap. 57 came into force providing that five-eights of the cost of this work should be borne by the city and the remaining three-eights by riparian owners to a depth of fifty feet. The commissioners, on a consideration of the special advantages accruing to and consequent increased values of the several properties in the area affected by the statute, made a new roll and imposed a larger portion of the three-eights of the cost, chargeable to owners, upon the properties on the north side of the street than was imposed upon assessable properties situate on the south side which they considered to derive less benefit from the works.\nThe respondents, by petition to quash the assessment roll contended that the commissioners had no right to impose a larger proportion of the cost on the north side and that they had unjustly assessed B\u00e9langer's property partly as an intermediate and partly as a corner lot on account of the opening of Beaudry Street since the widening of Notre-Dame Street, thereby increasing the portion of the cost of the expropriation ' chargeable to his property under the new valuation by several hundred dollars.\nThe Superior Court, Grill J., dismissed the petition and this decisi\u00f3n was reversed by the judgment appealed from.\nAtwater Q.C. and Ethier Q.C. for the appellant. The fullest weight and importance must be given to the report of the commissioners in preference to the opinions of witnesses chosen by parties interested in matters of expropriation. The award of commissioners chosen on account of their fitness and integrity and given discretion as a statutory tribunal should receive the same favour as the verdict of a jury, which has viewed the locality and adjudged personally as to benefits accruing.\nAs to the objection of excessive assessment, the amount is only of a few hundred dollars on a roll covering over half a million dollars and too trivial to be noticed. At any rate the objection ought to have been taken on a contestation of the roll at the time it was under revision and comes too late on an application to quash. The following authorities are cited: \u2014 Angell on Highways (2 ed.) pp. 215-226; In re William and Anthony Streets ([3]); in re John and Cherry Streets ([4]); In re Pearl Street ([5]); Morrison v. Mayor of Montreal ([6]); Lemoine v. City of Montreal ([7]); Benning v. Atlantic & Northwest Railway Col ([8]); Atlantic & Northwest Railway Co. v Wood ([9]).\nB\u00e9qu\u00e9 Q.C. for the respondents. The respondents object to the present roll, first, on the ground that both sides of the street should have been treated as one single territory, and each property taxed according to its proportionate assessed value; as was done by the first roll and for the further reason, peculiar to B\u00e9langer, that the value put upon his property for the purposes of the assessment should have been its value when the expropriation was made, unaffected by subsequent improvements such as the extension of Beau dry Street. . The increase is illegal and unjust. The proceedings in connection with the improvement constitute one single operation, and it required but one single valuation. The change in the situation of the property had nothing to do with the improvement to which the roll related and was due to another improvement, to the cost of which B\u00e9langer contributed; so that he is made to pay twice for the same thing. The valuation made for the first roll should not have been changed; it was not necessary to re-value the proper-ties on which the assessment was to be levied.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTASCHEREAU J. This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench granting the respondents 1 petition to quash an assessment roll relating to the expropriation required for the widening of Notre-Dame Street east in Montreal. The Supreme Court had dismissed it. The respondents' main ground of complaint against the said assessment roll is that it puts on the north side of the street upon which their lots are situated a larger proportion of the cost of this local improvement than on the south side of it.\nAfter a minute consideration of the divers and much confused statutory enactments bearing on the question I have come to the conclusion that the Superior Court was right in holding that the respondents' claim is unfounded and that the proprietors on the south side should not be taxed, for this improvement at the same rate as those on the north side when it is not denied, they do not benefit from it at the same rate. The policy of taxation of this nature rests upon the enhancement of the value of the properties resulting ' from the local improvement that necessitated it, and there is nothing in this case to justify a departure from that fair and equitable policy. Cooley, on Taxation 448-459.\nThe widening in question of Notre-Dame Street East was authorised in 1890 by 54 Vict. ch. 78 sec. 2, and the cost of it was by that Act to be levied and paid by the proprietors on each side of the street to a depth of fifty feet, one half by the city and one half by the said proprietors in accordance with sec. 243 of the charter of the city, 52 Vict. ch. 79. An amendment passed in 1892, 55 & 56 Vict. ch. 49 sec. 22 restricts that division of the cost of the improvement to a certain part of the street without otherwise alerting it, and authorises new assessment rolls to give effect to the said amendment. But by 57 Vict, ch 57 the apportionment of the cost thereof was altered, and five-eighths are now to be paid by the city and the other three-eights by the proprietors on each side of the street. It is on this last enactment that the respondents base their contention that both sides of the street have to pay in the same proportion the cost of the improvement, though both sides are not improved in the same proportion.\nI fail to see any foundation whatever to support the proposition that this last statute can be so construed\u00bb All that it does, and all that it purports to do, is to make the city pay five-eights instead of one half, without altering in any way the usual mode of assessing amongst the proprietors the three-eighths that are left to be paid by them, and to use the very words of sec. 243 of the charter expressly extended to this work by the Act of 1890 \"the rules regulating assessments in general.\" Now these rules are (by sec. 209 of the charter) that the city when it orders that the cost of a local improvement shall be paid in whole or in part by the parties interested shall be assessed upon their pro-parties proportionately to the benefit that the improvement brings to them ; secs. 209, 213. And says sec. 228:\nIt shall be the duty of the commissioners to determine the proportion in which the proprietors shall be respectively assessed, and to assess and apportion, in such manner as to them may appear most reasonable and just the compensation accorded by them for the land taken and the costs and expenses incurred in and about such expropriation upon all the immoveable properties declared to be benefited by such improvement taking into account the benefit to be derived from the improvement in the proportions so determined by the commissioners.\nNow why the benefit to be derived from the widening; of Notre-Dame Street should not likewise be taken into account and the north side be made to puy more than the south side if it benefits more from it, is what I entirely fail to see In the absence of a clear and express enactment to support it, the respondents' proposition to the contrary cannot be countenanced. What has been declared by the legislature and all that has been so declared in the matter is that 50 feet of the properties on each side of the street are specially benefitted by this widening of the street, and that three-eighths of the cost thereof should be borne by the owners of the said properties but there is nowhere to be found the enactment that the assessment of these three-eighths should be made regardless of the benefit that accrues to each of these properties from this improvement, or, what the respondents' contention amounts to, that the south side proprietors should pay more than the north side ones for as they benefit less than the north side it is obvious that to make them pay at the same rate would be to make them pay more. Special benefits to the property assessed, that is benefits received by it in addition to those received by other properties liable to the assessment, is the true foundation upon which these local assessments rest; Dillon Mun. Corp. 761. Here, the legislature has declared what are the properties generally benefited by the widening of this street and to what extent as between them and the corporation of the city the cost of it should be borne but it has left with the assessors as usual in such cases to apportion the burden according to the benefit and to determine what part of that benefit each parcel of these properties actually and separately receives, and for that purpose, by sec. 3 of 57 Vict. ch. 57, the assessors are specially empowered to give effect to the alterations introduced by the Act, The fact that by the previous roll both sides of the street had been assessed at the same rate cannot affect the case. That roll having, been set aside the assessors had the right by the new roll to act as they did, if, as a fact, not open to review here they found that the north side had benefited more than the south side from this improvement.\nAnother ground of complaint against this assessment roll is made by one of the respondents, B\u00e9langer, based upon the fact that he is charged $381600 more by this roll than he was by the preceding roll which was set aside by the legislature. He contends that the subsequent increase in value of his property should not have been taken into account by the new roll. The cofisiderants of the judgement of the Court of Appeal do not notice this objection, and there is nothing in it. There is no evidence that the respondent urged this ground of complaint before the Board of Revisers; the assessment was duly confirmed by the statutory tribunal; and for him now to ask that a roll on a valuation of over half a million dollars should, be set aside because he is assessed $381 more than he thinks he ought to have been, seems to me a preposterous demand.\nThe appeal is allowed with costs and the judgment of the superior Court restored.\nGWYNNE J. (dissenting).\u2014I entirely concur in the judgment of the court below to which I cannot usefully add anything. I must therefore dissent from the present judgment.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE was prevented by illness from taking part in the judgment.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant Ethier & Archambault.\nSolicitors for the respondents : B\u00e9\u00efque, Lafontaine, Turgeon & Roberston.\n[1] Q R. 9 Q.

On 3rd December, 1897, she brought a second action for further damages said to have been ascertained since the institution of her first action and recovered $5,000 additional damages. The appeal is from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench at Montreal affirming this decision. The questions at issue on this appeal are stated in the judgments reported.\nAtwater Q.C. and Ethier Q.C. for the appellant. This action is for bodily injuries, and was prescribed by the lapse of one year, Art. 2262 C.C., at the time of its institution, and falls within Art. 2267 C. C. The right of action is denied, and under Art. 2188 C. C. the court must of its own motion, supply the defence. Breakey. v. Carter ([1]); Dorion v. Crowley ([2]). It becomes a question of costs if judgment turns upon this point. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Robin son ([3]).\nThe first action did not interrupt prescription of the damages now claimed. There was no continuing cause of damage, although the effect of the accident might have been continuing. St. Marie v. City of Mont real ([4]).\nFor all over the $1,000 awarded by the first judgment the limitation has operated. Art. 2262 C. C.

On si l'amputation n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e n\u00e9cessaire qu'apr\u00e8s l'ann\u00e9e expir\u00e9e, ii pourrait poursuivre pendant l'ann\u00e9e subs\u00e9 quente quoiqu'il n'eut fait aucune r\u00e9clamation du rant l'ann\u00e9e qui a suivi l'accident.\nMistelle n'est pas la loi. \" Their Lordships\" dit Lord Watson, en d\u00e9livrant le jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9, dans la cause de Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Robinson ([9]),\nsee no reason to doubt that \\any claim competent to him, (the injured party), against the respondents, had been cut off by prescription, (of one year since the date of the accident.) C'est sur ce principe, qui domine le sujet dans le droit fran\u00e7ais comme dans le droit anglais, qu' Holroyd J. disait dan weil v. Young ([10]).\nThe statut of limitations is \u00e0 bar to the original cause of action and to all consequential damages resulting from it. Subs\u00e9quent damages do not constitute a fresh ground of action.\nMais nous a dit l'intim\u00e9e, ma seconde action peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une continuation de Ia pre mir\u00e9. Je n'ai pu saisir sur quoi elle atent\u00e9 d'appuyer cette pr\u00e9tention. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tait bien et d\u00fbment termin\u00e9e \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit quand cette seconde a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise. Le jugement et le paiement par l'appel ante du montant de A condamnation contre elle avait mis fin compl\u00e8te au litige. Si A premi\u00e8re eut \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e devant la Cour de Circuit et la seconde devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, l'intim\u00e9e ne pr\u00e9tendrait pas qu\u2019\u00c0 derni\u00e8re est la continuation de la premi\u00e8re. Il dolt en \u00eatre ainsi quoique les deux aient \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es devant la m\u00eame cour. La derni\u00e8re est une demande nouvelle et enti\u00e8rement distincte de la premi\u00e8re.\nEt la premi\u00e8re n'a interrompu civilement la prescription que pour les mille piastres que le jugement lui a accord\u00e9es. Il ne peut pas \u00eatre question d'interruption de prescription de ce qui ne forme pas partie de l'acte interruption.\nLe jugement sur la premi\u00e8re poursuite n'a Pu pro duire novation comme l'intim\u00e9e l'a soutenu \u00e0 l'audience, pour ce qui n'en formait pas partie. La novation suppose une dette pr\u00e9existante, une prescription commenc\u00e9e qui recommence \u00e0 courir. Or Si sa cran\u00e9e \u00e9tait pr\u00e9existante elle \u00e9tait incluse dans la premi\u00e8re action, et dans ce cas, cadit questio; l'intim\u00e9e eat hors de cour, et par la loi, et par los termes m\u00eames de A r\u00e9serve que fait le premier jugement qui est express\u00e9ment limit\u00e9e aux dommages non compris dans la premi\u00e8re action. Et si sa cran\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas in cluse dans la premi\u00e8re action, alors elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 annihil\u00e9e par le laps d'une ann\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l'accident.\nD'ailleurs, y eut-il interruption mais pas de novation, la prescription aurait recommence \u00e0 courir par le m\u00eame temps qu'auparavant, (art. 2264 C. C.) et l'action de l'intim\u00e9e n'en serait pas moins prescrite car elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e plus d'un an apr\u00e8s ce jugement. Taut qu'\u00e0 la partie de la premi\u00e8re action dont l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9boute, ii n'y a pas eu en loi d'interruption civile. Et ii n'\u00e9tait pas au pouvoir du juge de d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter qu'il en serait autrement. L'effet du renvoi d'une action est que la prescription a con tine \u00e0 courir comme sil n'y avait pas eu d'interruption.\nPuis l'article 2265 C. C., cite par l'intim\u00e9e, qui d\u00e9cr\u00e8te qu'une poursuite forme un titre qui ne Se prescrit que par trente ans, ne peut venir \u00e0 son aide, Il n'a d'application, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, qu'\u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet du jugement, aux mille piastres que ce juge ment lui a allou\u00e9es.\nL'intim\u00e9e a avanc\u00e9 la proposition que l'appelante \u00e9tait li\u00e9e par la r\u00e9serve faite dans le jugement sur la premi\u00e8re poursuite, parce qu\u2019elle n'en avait pas appel\u00e9. Mais je ne vois l\u00e0 rien qui justifie ses conclusions. D'abord, comment un d\u00e9fendeur pourrait-il appeler d'une telle r\u00e9serve, lorsqu'il se soumet au jugement et en paie le montant ?\nPuis, pourquoi en appeler ? Elle est inefficace et impuissante \u00e0 faire revivre un droit d'action que la loi d\u00e9clare absolument p\u00e9rimer, et une cran\u00e9e pr\u00e9 su\u00e9e juris et de jure avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement pay\u00e9e, m\u00eame \u00e0 l'encontre des mineurs et autres incapables en loi contre qui par exception, curait prescription d'une telle action, quoique non valentem agr\u00e9e. Pour ces raisons, j'opine avec Monsieur le Juge Grouard que l'action de l'intim\u00e9e doit \u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9e.\nMais j'irais plus loin. Je ne crois pas qu'elle eut droit \u00e0 une seconde action, quand bien m\u00eame elle n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prescrite, et c'est peut-\u00eatre sur Ce motif que devraient \u00eatre bas\u00e9es nos conclusions. Elle a exerc\u00e9 la seule r\u00e9clamation qu'elle e\u00fbt en loi contre l'appelante. Sa pr\u00e9sente action, bas\u00e9e comme elle l'est sur la premi\u00e8re, aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9fense en droit Elle est cens\u00e9e avoir d\u00e9i\u00e0 demand\u00e9 et avoir obtenu tous les dommages auxquels cet accident lui a donn\u00e9 droit.\nDans une cause de Fetter v. Beat ([11]) le demandeur all\u00e9guait que sur une action pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente il avait recouvr\u00e9e certains dommages pour un assaut commis sur sa personne par le d\u00e9tendeur, mais que depuis, une fracture du cr\u00e2ne des suites de cet accident s'\u00e9tant d\u00e9clare, ii r\u00e9clamait les dommages additionnels qu'il ignorait lors de sa premi\u00e8re demande. Mais ut d\u00e9bout\u00e9 de sa demande,\nfor there was but one blow and that was the canse of action in both suits.\nCette d\u00e9cision date de loin, mais elle fait encore autorit\u00e9 dans la jurisprudence anglaise.\nDans une cause de Hodsoll v. Stallebrass ([12]); Little dale J., dit;\nA fresh action could not be brought unless there were both a new unlawful act and. fresh damage.\nDans Serrao v. Noel ([13]); Bowen L. J. dit;\nThe principle is that where there is but one cause of action, damages must be assessed once for all.\nEt dans une cause comparativement r\u00e9cente The Darley Main Colliery Company v. Mitchell ([14]). Lord Halsbury disait dans la Chambre des Lords: No one will think of disputing the proposition that for one cause of action you must recover all damages incident to it by law once and forever.\nLord Bram well ajoutait:\nIt is a rule that when a thing directly wrongful in itself is done to a man, in itself a cause of action, he must if he suss in respect of it do so once and for all. As, if he is bitten or wounded, if he sues, he must sue for all his damage, past, present and future, certain and contingent. He cannot maintain an action for a broken arm and subsequently for a broken rib, though he did not know of it when he commenced his first action.\nVide Pollock on Torts, .5 ed.) 184; Mayne on Damages, (5 ed.) 102; Sutherland on Damages, vol. 1, par. 106; vol. 3, par. 1251; Clegg v. Dearden ([15]).\nAux Etats Unis la jurisprudence est unanime dans le m\u00eame sens.\nIn actions for injury to the person by accident on a highway or railroad, \u2014dit Metcalf J., dans Warner v. Bacon ([16]) \u2014; it is settled law that when damages have been once recovered, no new action can be maintained for sufferings afterwards endured from the unforeseen effect of the original injury.\nVide Curliss v. Rochester & Syracuse R. R. Co. (1); Filer v. New York Central Railroad Company (2); City of North Vernon v. Voegler ([17]).\nFresh damages merely will not give a fresh action and a judgment in a suit founded on a single act of tort will be a conclusive bar to a second suit for the same injury, although harmful consequences may have made themselves apparent subsequent to the first suit; as it will be held that in the first verdict the plaintiff recovered all that he was entitled to claim. Henee the statute of limitations runs from the time of the breach. Sedgwick on Damages, vol. 1, par. 84.\nA la Louisiane, sous un Code calqu\u00e9 sur le droid fran\u00e7ais, on n\u00e8pes trouver un seul cas parmi le grand nombre de causes identiques que les rapports judiciaires contiennent, o\u00f9 un m\u00eame accident ait donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 deux ou plusieurs actions successives par la m\u00eame personne.

Et je puis en dire autant de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec, si j'en juge par le factum de l'intim\u00e9e.\nEn Ecosse, o\u00f9 le droit romain guide directement la jurisprudence, ii est aussi de r\u00e8gle qu'une seule action sous ces circonstances, pent \u00eatre port\u00e9e.\n\u201cI am of opinion,\" dit le Lord President Inglis sur un appel dans la cause de Stevenson v. Pontifex & Wood ([20]),\nthat a single act cannot be made the ground of two or more actions for the purpose of recovering damages arising within different periods but caused by the same act.\nEt Lord Adam ajoutait;\nThere was only one wrongful act on the part of the defenders, and in my opinion, as soon as the act was committed, the right of action to recover all damages arising from it arose. It is always impossible to ascertain accurately what sum of damage will cover the injury, but although the amount of damages awarded may be to some extent speculative yet the evil thus resulting is far less than would be the evil of allowing successive actions of damages from time to time arising from the same originating cause.\nEt le jugement de la cour inf\u00e9rieure par lequel les d\u00e9fendeurs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 a assoilzied from the action, \" fut confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9.\nCette jurisprudence est bas\u00e9e sur la maxime \u201c Nemo his vex\u00e2ri debet pro eddem causa,\" Wood v. Gray & Sons ([21])\nqui pr\u00e9vaut dans le droit fran\u00e7ais comme dans le droit anglais, et n'est d'ailleurs que la cons\u00e9quence logique de l'extension lib\u00e9rale adopt\u00e9e par nos tribunaux \u00e0 l'instar de ceux d'Angleterre et des Etats Unis des r\u00e8gles dominantes sur 1 appr\u00e9ciation et la mesure des dommages r\u00e9sultants d'injures corporelles.\nL'on rencontre en France des d\u00e9cisions dans le sens contraire, Dal. 62, 1, 123; Dal. 71, 2, 241; (voir 20 Laurent 527 et Fuzier-Hermann, Rep. vo. \u201c Chose jug\u00e9e.\" nos. 439 et seq.) mais \u00e0 mon avis, elles s'\u00e9car tent des vrais principes. Un dommage seul ne peut \u00eatre la base d'une action. Il faut une faute, sans cela pas d'action possible; or, si cette faute a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 la base l\u00e9gale, la cause juridique d'une action en r\u00e9paration, elle ne pent \u00eatre la base, A cause d'un nombre illimit\u00e9 d'actions du m\u00eame genre contre le m\u00eame d\u00e9fendeur.\nD'ailleurs ces decisions fussent-elles correctes en France, (elles n'y sont pas re\u00e7ues sans h\u00e9sitations, Dal. Rep. supp. vo. C Chose jug\u00e9e,\" n. 122), seraient inadmissibles ici non seulement parce que la mesure des dommages en pareils cas est, dans l'application, \u00abplus large ici qu'en France, mais encore par\u00e9e que, en d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant A prescription absolue d'une seule ann\u00e9e et en autorisant les tribunaux \u00e0 la suppl\u00e9er d'office, notre Code s'est tellement \u00e9cart\u00e9 de la loi fran\u00e7aise sur la mati\u00e8re que le but \u00e9vident du l\u00e9gislateur a \u00e9t\u00e9 de restreindre ici \u00e0 des limites plus \u00e9troites le recours aux tribunaux sur cc genre de r\u00e9clamations et de rendre dor\u00e9navant impossible la multiplicit\u00e9 d'actions successives bas\u00e9es sur une seule et m\u00eame faute, si toutefois elle a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 permise.\nSEDGEWICK and KING J. J. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal without costs, for the reasons stated by Taschereau and Gironard JJ.\nGIIROUARD J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec rendered on the 30th of September, 1899, which confirmed a judgment of the Superior Court rendered on the 23rd of December, 1898, and which con demined the present appellant to pay to the respond ent the sum of $5000 with interest and costs, as damages for bodily injuries sustained by her on the 9th of August, 1895, owing to the alleged bad con diction of a sidewalk in the City of Montreal.\nOn the 2nd of December, 1895, the respondent instituted a first action in damages against the appellant by which she demanded that the city be con demned to pay her the sum of $2,000 at which amount she assessed all her damages past and future. She alleged in her declaration:\nQue la demanderesse, \u00e0 raison des faits ci-dessus, a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 et \u00e9prouvera des dommages s'levant \u00e0 au moins deux mule piastres.\nOn the 12th of June 1896, the Superior Court having heard the parties and their witnesses, condemned the appellant to pay $1,000:\nConsid\u00e9rant que, pour ces raisons, ii nous parait qu'une somme de mille dollars est suffisante pour indemniser A demanderesse des suites de cet accident qui est du \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence des employ\u00e9s de A d\u00e9fende ressue;\nA maintenu et maintient l'action de la demanderesse \"pour la dite somme de mille dollars, et condamne A d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 payer \u00e0 la demanderesse A dite some de mulle dollars avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 compter du 4 d\u00e9cembre dernier, date de la signification du bref et de la d\u00e9claration, et les d\u00e9pens distraits \u00e0 Mm. Bisaillon, Brousseau et Lajoie, avocats de A demanderesse. La demanderesse ayant demand\u00e9 de lui r\u00e9server son\nrecours pour les damages futurs qui peuven lui r\u00e9sulter de cet accident, la\ncourt r\u00e9serve ce recours si toutefois ces dommages ne sont pas inclus dans sa fr\u00e9sente demands, ce que le tribunal n'entend pas pr\u00e9fuger.\nOn the 3rd of December, 1897, the respondent instituted a second action against the city by which after setting up her previous action and the judgment thereon she states that she has ascertained since the said judgment that her injuries were far more serious than she then realised, and, in cons\u00e9quence of the same accident, she claims additional damages of $10,000.\nShe alleges:\n7. Qu'a la suite de cet accident A maladie qui l'accable et les soins assidus que son \u00e9tat exige de sa soeur, seule, l'acad\u00e9mie que toutes deux t enaient \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al est d\u00e9sert\u00e9e et la demanderesse est r\u00e9duite \u00e0 1st plus profonde mis\u00e8re;\n8. Que le dit accident les l\u00e9sions les douleurs et l'\u00e9tat d\u00e9labr\u00e9 de sant\u00e9 qui s'en est suivi et se continue et a compromis les jours de la demanderesse sont dus exclusivement \u00e0 A n\u00e9gligence, l'incurie et la faute de A d\u00e9fenderesse et \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s, et out caus\u00e9 des dommages irr\u00e9parables ala demanderesse, qu'elle r\u00e9duit \u00e0 A somme de $10,000.\nIt does seem that by this second action, the re spondent demands damages accrued both after and before the rendering of the first judgment. It is not surprising therefore that the appellant met this second action by pleading that the damages claimed by the second suit were covered by the first judgment, and at all events that the $1,000, which the city was con demined to pay and did pay was a sufficient com sensation for any damages resulting from the same accident;\nune compensation suffisante et une indemnit\u00e9 raisonnable pour tous les dommages que la demanderesse pr\u00e9tend avoir soufferts \u00e0 raison du susdit accident, et qu'elle n'a pas droit \u00e0 aucune autre somme de deniers tel et suivant que r\u00e9clam\u00e9 en son action.\nA copy of the evidence adduced in the first case was filed by consent in support of the second demand, and some six or seven fresh witnesses were also heard viva voce, before Mr. Justice Charland, who on the 23rd of December, 1898, condemned the appellant to pay to the respondent the further sum of $5,000 and costs of suit. In appeal this judgment was confirmed purely and simply with costs.\nThe city appeals to this court and for the first time urges prescription of the second action under Arts. 2261, 2262, 2267, 2183, 2188 C. C\nArt. 2261. The following actions are prescribed by two years:\n2. For damages resulting from offenses or quasi-offenses, whenever other provisions do not apply; Art. 2262. The following actions are prescribed by one year:\n2. For bodily injuries, saving the special provisions contained in article 1056 and cases regulated by sp\u00e9cial law; Art. 2267. In all cases mentioned in articles 2250, 2260, 2261 and 2262, the debt is absolutely extinguished and no action can be maintained after the delay, for prescription has expired.\nArt. 2183. Extinctive or negative prescription is a bar to and in some cases precludes any action.\nArt. 218K. The court cannot of its own motion supply the defence resulting from prescription, except in cases where the right of action -is denied.\nIt is conceded that the exception contained in the last paragraph of Art. 2262 does not apply to the present case.\nIt is clear that the present action is one for bodily injuries and comes within the provisions of article 2262 This court has held on several occasions that short prescriptions can be applied even in appeal, although not pleaded and set up for the first time in the factum or at the hearing. Breakey v. Carter ([22]); Dorion v. Crowley ([23]). In the case of The Ganadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Robinson ([24]) the court added that\nby article 2188 the courts are bound of their own motion, to dismiss any action brought after the expiration of one year, if limitation is not specially pleaded.\nTrue, the decision of the Supreme Court was reversed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ([25]) but upon another ground and the above doctrine was not disturbed.\nThe respondent raised several objections to the contention that the second suit is prescribed. In the first place she contends that not being able to ascertain exactly the extent of her injuries, she could not proceed sooner, and claims the application of the maxim laid down in Art. 2232 C. C. C Contra non valentem agree nulla currit prescription.\" But can this excuse apply to the first action ? And, if no answer to that action can it be to a second, third and possibly, I pre sume, to a fourth one? Can the plaintiff say that, because she could not ascertain the extent of her injury within the year she can take it after? Evidently not. But there is another answer to this contention. What prevented her from demanding by or in the first action a first condamnation par provision for the damages so far liquidated, and as many other interlocutory judgments in the same suit as circum stances would permit and a final condemnation when plaintiff would be satisfied that all the damages suffered have been ascertained, a course which seems to have been followed in the array of the court of Brussels of the 23rd July 1885 referred to by the respondent? Why did she not take her second action between the 12th of June, 1896, and the 9th of August, 1896, that is, within the year after the accident, and, if the full measure of damages could not then be ascertained, make a reservation of any further con collusions which might have been necessary, as above suggested?\nIn the second place the respondent submits that under Art. \u00a3264 C. C. the prescription invoked against her has been interrupted. Art. 2264 lays down the rule that after interruption, except as to prescription by ten years, prescription recommences to run for the same time as before, if there be no notation. Taking for granted that interruption would apply to a case like the present one\u2014a point open to much doubt, as the first action was dismissed for everything exceeding the $1,000 (C. C. 2226),\u2014it seems plain to us that at least the second action was taken six months too late, that is nearly eighteen months after the rendering of the first judgment. In fact the Superior Court could not reserve an action which is absolutely denied by the legislature. The reservation evidently could not have any effect after the expiration of one year.\nThe respondent also contends that the appellant has tacitly renounced the benefit of prescription by not pleading the same, and she quotes Arts. 2184 and 2185 G. C. as supporting that contention. But as the well settled jurisprudence of this court is to maintain short prescriptions when not pleaded, even of its own motion when not even suggested no such tacit renunciation can be presumed from the mere silence of the defendant.\nFinally the respondent lays down the proposition that under article 2265 C. C. the effect of the first judgment was to furnish her a new title, prescriptible by thirty years. Art. 2265 says that\nany judicial condemnation constitutes a title which is only prescribed by thirty years.\nAs we read the first judgment, nothing was settled in her favour as to future damages; there is no \"judicial condemnation \u201c or adjudication of that matter within the meaning of Art 2265; there was a mere reservation claimed by the plaintiff but not adjudicated upon and forming no part of the con damnation The reservation means that if a second action be properly taken, the defendant cannot plead chose jug\u00e9e, and that was all the effect of the reservation. The recourse for future damages is not recognised; reservation is simply made of the plaintiff's declaration that she is entitled to such remedy not purely and simply, but provided the future damages are not included in the first demand which the court did not intend to decide, n'entend pas pr\u00e9juger.\nFor all these reasons we have come to the conclusion that the appeal must be allowed and the action of the respondent dismissed without costs in all the courts, as the point of prescription was only raised before the court.\nHis Lordship the Chief Justice was on account of illness, unable to take part in the judgment.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Ethier & Archcambault.\nSolicitor for respondent: F.

The illegality which vitiates such a contract cannot be waived or condoned by the conduct or pleas of the party against whom it is asserted and it is the duty of the courts, ex mero mot\u00fb, to notice the nullity of such contracts at any stage of the case and without pleading. Judgment appealed from reversed, Girouard J. dissenting.\nPer Girouard J. (dissenting).\u2014In Canada, before the Criminal Code, 1892, lotteries were mere offences or contraventions and not crimes and consequently the Act of the Quebec Legislature was constitutional. APPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, maintaining the plaintiffs action with costs.\nThe respondent and his partner, (whose interests he subsequently acquired), entered into a written agreement in 1890, with the appellant for the operation of a lottery scheme authorized to be carried on by the appellant under the provisions of a statute of the Legislature of Quebec (53rd Vict ch. 36), and an order of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, passed in conformity therewith, and deposited $30,000 in a chartered bank as a continuing security for the operation of the lottery according to the terms of the agreement. The object of the scheme was to secure funds for the erection by the appellant of a national building, now known as the \"Monument National, l in Montreal, for the establishment of a public library and the organization of courses of lectures aid practical instruction in the edifice to be constructed upon lands belonging to the appellant. The lottery was carried on under the conditions stated in the agreement and in 1892, another agreement was entered into by the same parties whereby the $30,000, which had been so deposited, was to be utilized by the appellants to facilitate the continuation of the construction of the building, above referred to which had already been commenced.\nThis second agreement referred to the agreement of 1890 and provided that, notwithstanding such use of the money, appellant would be deemed to continue to hold the same and to be the depositary thereof to secure the execution of the obligations undertaken in the first agreement. It also provided:\u2014That if Brault should carry out the lottery operations during the whole term of the first agreement, appellants might apply the $30,000 on account of the last of the annual payment due them under its conditions * that appellant might also (should occasion arise) apply all or any part of said sum, in accordance with the provisions of agreement of 1890, to extinguish obligations towards appellant or holders of lottery tickets ; that if the government withdrew the permit appellant was to repay said $30,000 or any part of it that might remain due in five years from the date of such revocation, or at the end of the time when the agreement was to run in the event of such time being not more than five years from such revocation ; that so long as respondent should carry on the lottery operations, appellant was to pay them four per cent interest on the $30,000 ; that should he discontinue the lottery operations, appellant was thereafter to pay him five per cent instead of four, and that each interest instalment was to bear interest from its due date till paid; and, as security for the repayment of said deposit, appellant mortgaged certain property described in the deed. It was further provided that nothing in the second agreement should be construed as in derogation or novation of the conditions or obligations of the first agreement.\nSubsequently in 1892, the Government of Quebec revoked the permit by Order-in-Council and conferred the right to hold the lottery on other persons for the benefit of the appellant and the respondent brought his action for $2306.55 for instalments of interest at 5 per cent on the deposit of $30,000. The Superior Court maintained the plaintiff's action and the present appeal is asserted from the judgment of the Court of Review affirming that decision.\nFitzpat\u00efick Q.C. (Solicitor-General), and Beique Q.C. for the appellant. The action is an attempt to enforce a contract which appears from respondent's own declaration to be not only illegal, but an offence against the criminal law ; arts. 989, 990, 1062 C. C. The Quebec Act 53 Vict. ch. 36 and the Orders-in-Council passed there under, cannot afford any justification. The holding of lotteries was made penal before Confederation, and these penal statutes remained in force till repealed or modified by parliament. Sec.129 B. N. A. Act; Dobie v. Temporalities Board ([1]). The Dominion Acts, since Confederation, have re-enacted and extended the old law, and any Quebec statute, purporting to authorize a lottery such as here in question, was an attempt to repeal or suspend the operation of legislation upon criminal law by the Parliament of Canada or its predecessors and therefore ultra vires.\nThe deeds of 1890 and 1892 cannot be separated from the rest of the subject matter and treated as distinct contracts. The covenants in the deeds have but one object and form but one contract which, if illegal in one part, is wholly illegal. This constitutes absolute nullity which should be judicially noticed even in the absence of any plea to that effect. The principal covenants are null because they relate to operations opposed to public order and forbidden by the criminal law and the accessory obligations must be equally null. Pal. '63, 2, 113; Pal.

C. for the respondent. The second agreement is separate and distinct from the agreement as to the operation of the lottery and is a mere contract of loan. The rate of interest is dependent on conditions mentioned, by reference, only as a matter of convenience.\nThe rate of five per cent per annum prevails on account of the Order-in-Council having been made for the cancellation of the permit according to the terms provided in that event, by the agreement for the loan of the capital. The association, which procured the annulment of the permit and the substitution of other persons for respondent in the operation of the scheme cannot be allowed to disregard the contract and retain the principal loaned without payment of any interest for the use of the money. These funds were not used for an illegal purpose, but for the erection of a national educational institution. The respondent would be, in any case, entitled to the legal rate of interest. Art.1785 C.C.\nThe Quebec Acts in question are police regulations, properly within the legislative jurisdiction of the province and caused no interference with Dominion Criminal Legislation at the time they were passed. The contracts are both anterior to the Criminal Code 1892 and at their date the operation of such a lottery, under the control and permission of the provincial authorities was not in any sense, criminal, nor against good morals or public policy. Even therefore if the agreement for the loan be held to have been based upon any such consideration and that the contracts are co-relative, there cannot be any ground for nullity.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Taschereau. TASCHEREAU J.\u2014The respondent claims from the appellant by this action divers sums due to him, as he contends in virtue of two deeds passed between them in 1800 and 1892 for the carrying on of certain lottery operations in the Province of Quebec purported to have been authorised by a statute of the provincial legislature. Had the provincial legislature the power under the British North America Act to so authorise a lottery which was then made an offence by chapter 159 of the Revised Statutes of the Dominion as it is now likewise by the Criminal Code ? There is in my opinion, no room whatever to doubt that the legisla true had no such power. The legislation in question was ultra vires and void and an undue interference with the criminal law of the Dominion over which the federal legislature has exclusive authority under the Constitutional Act\nBy the criminal law of England, as introduced in the Province of Quebec by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and the Act 14 Geo. III. c. 83, all lotteries were prohibited and punishable as public nuisances s 10 & 11 Wm. III. c. 17; 8 Geo. I. c. 2 sec. 36; and 12 Geo. II. c. 28; Ex parte Rousse ([11]); Cronyn v. Widder ([12]). Under the French law previously in force in the province, though this is immaterial, they were likewise illegal. 4 Brillion, Dict. des Arr. vo. \u201cLotterie \u201c; Fr\u00e8re-Jouan du Saint. Jeu et Pari, n. 185. In 1856 the legislature of the Province of Canada passed a statute (19 Vict ch. 49; C. S. C., ch. 95), also pro habiting them under pain of penalties recoverable by summary conviction. That statute was in force as ch. 159 R. S. C. till it was superseded by sec. 205 of the Criminal Code. But the offence remained a misdemeanour as it previously was, and probably still continued to be an indictable one as this statute did not create a new offence, though, whether it did or not, would not make any difference in this case. Sec 933 Criminal Code; 1st Russell Crimes and Misdemeanors (6 ed.) 200 et seq. ; Rex. v. Gregory ([13]); Reg. v. Crashaw ([14]); Reg. v. Hall ([15]); Hamilton v. Massie ([16]); Bishop Stat. Cr. 250 et seq. By altering the punishment the nature of the offence was not altered. If it was a misdemeanor previously as it certainly was (Burbidge, Criminal Law p. 181) it was not less a misdemeanor afterwards which passed at Confederation under the exclusive control of the Federal Legislative authority. The provincial legislature therefore had not the power to authorise the lottery in question, and its legislation on the subject is null of a nullity de non sees.\nThe respondent, however, claims the right at common law, to recover back from the appellants what he has paid or loaned to them or deposited with them, notwithstanding the illegality of his contract. But that is a matter which cannot be determined here. His action is upon a contract; that contract is illegal and void, and his action must consequently he dismissed. Arts. 13, 14, 989, 990 C. C. He also in his factum invokes res judicata. But there is no such issue raised by the pleadings could it affect the result of our decision upon the constitutional question.\nHis further contentions as to his good faith and the bad faith of the appellants are based upon a total misapprehension of the nature of the objection upon which his action must fail. Upon his own allegations, he has entered with the appellants into a con spiracy to commit an unlawful act. It is hardly necessary to say that courts of justice cannot sanction such dealings or give them any countenance what so ever. It is on the contrary their duty to notice illegal ties of this nature ex officio and allow them to be suggested without any plea at any stage of the case. Nor could the illegality of the respondent's claim be waived or cured by his adversary's pleas or conduct. And the fact that he may have believed that the Quebec legislature had the power to authorise this lottery is, in law, no ground to support his action. Sec.14 Crim. Code.\nLes nullit\u00e9s de droit public c'est a dire celles qui ont pour cause principale et premi\u00e8re, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de tous (says Solon, 2 Nullit\u00e9s no. 345) ne se couvrent point par le consentement des parties directement int\u00e9ress\u00e9es \u00e0 l'acte ; en pareil cas Ia loi r\u00e9siste continuellement, et par elle-m\u00eame \u00e0 l'acte qu'elle d\u00e9fend ; elle le r\u00e9duit \u00e0 un pur fait qui ne peut \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 ni ratifi\u00e9. Pirivatorum conventio juri publico non deroget.\nCompare The Manufacturers Life Ins. Co. v. Anctil ([17]).\nLa loi qui interdit les loteries est une loi d'ordre public (says Fr\u00e8rejouan du Saint, Jeu et Pari, No. 211), et elle frappe d'une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 ceux qui y contreviennent. La nullit\u00e9 des conventions qui ont la loterie pour base est donc une nullit\u00e9 radicale et absolute que peuvent invoquer toutes les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es indistinctement. Le promoteur de l'op\u00e9ration lui-m\u00eame peut se retrancher derri\u00e8re la prohibition l\u00e9gale pour se dispenser d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter ses engagements, car nul ne peut \u00eatre contraint de violer une loi p\u00e9nale, sous pr\u00e9texte qu'il s'y est oblig\u00e9 par contrat.\nLa loi ne peut admettre, (says B\u00e9darrides, Dol et Fraude, Nos. 1291, 1295), que ce qui a pour objet d'\u00e9luder les pr\u00e9ceptes de la morale, l'exigence des bonnes moeurs ou les dispositions d'ordre public puisse jamais produire aucun effet. Tout ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en sens contraire doit donc s'effacer et dispara\u00eetre.\nUpon that principle, it was held in a case cited in Sirey, 69, 2, 53, that\nles loteries \u00e9tant prohib\u00e9es par Ia loi fran\u00e7aise toutes conventions ou obligations relatives a leur organisation sent nulles comme ayant une cause illicite et ne peuvent donner lieu \u00e0 une action devant les tribunaux. Other cases to the same effect are reported in Sirey 67, 2, 86; 67, 2, 87; 65, 1, 77; 70, 1, 357; and Dalloz, 46, 2, 195.\nIn a Louisiana case, Davis v. Caldwell, et al. ([18]), the plaintiff claimed from the defendants a certain sum as remuneration for services rendered by him in aid of their project to organise a lottery. But his action was dismissed on the ground that\nthe contract sued upon being intimately connected with a speculation reprobarte and forbidden by law could not be enforced in a court of justice.\nThe respondent s attempt to separate the agreement. of 1892 from that of 1890 cannot succeed. They are both in furtherance of an unlawful scheme, and the invalidity of the first vitiates the other collateral or auxiliary agreement springing from it. Davis v. Holbrook ([19]): Fox v. New Orleans ([20]); Cummings v. Saux ([21]); Armstrong v. Toller ([22]). Fisher v. Bridges ([23]), to which His Lordship the Chief Justice has called my attention, is a case in point.\nAppeal allowed, and action dismissed. No costs in the three courts.\nGWYNNE and SEDGEWICK JJ. concurred in the reasons given by Taschereau J.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting).\u2014We have not to inquire whether or not a contract prohibited by law can have any effect; that point is formally settled by Arts. 989 and 990 of the Civil Code. On the other hand it would not be sufficient to content ourselves with an inquiry as to whether lotteries are prohibited under the criminal laws of England. As a matter of fact, when in 1774, the latter were introduced into Canada lotteries were forbidden in England as crimes or misdemeanours. Since the end of the 17th century, the British Parliament has declared that all lotteries which until then had been permitted by the common law, should be common and public nuisances, that is to say, indictable offences (10 & 11 Wm. Ill ch. 17). This statute was still in force at the time of the passing of the Quebec Act, which introduced the criminal laws of England as part of the law of Canada. Exparte Rousse ([24]). This statute was subsequently modified in England by several Acts of Parliament, (19 Geo. IIl, ch. 21; 22 Geo. IlI, ch. 47; 27 Geo. III, ch. 1; 42 Geo. Ill, ch. 57 and ch. 119, sec. 27; 46 Geo. II, I ch. 148; 6 Geo. IV, ch. 60).\nAll these statutes continued to define lotteries as being public nuisances and finally by 46 Geo. Ill, ch. 148, the penalties imposed could not be demanded except in the name of the Attorney-General before the Court of Exchequer, instead of before ordinary justices of the peace. Reg. v. Tuddenham (1).\nOur ancestors considered that these provisions were not suitable to a new country, and they mitigated their rigour considerably by several statutes passed as well before as since confederation of the provinces in 1867, (19 & 20 Vict. ch. 49; C. S. C. ch. 95 ; 23 Vict. ch. 36 ; 46 Vict. ch. 36 ; E. S. C. ch. 159 ; 32 Vict. ch. 36 (Que.) ; R. S. Q. Arts. 2911-2920 ; 53 Vict. ch. 36 (Queue... Not one of these statutes declares lotteries to be crimes or public nuisances; all of them prohibit lotteries, it is true, except in certain cases but an offender incurs simply a fine of twenty dollars to be recovered in a summary manner upon the suit of any person brought before a mayor, alderman or other justice of the peace, one-half of the fine being payable to the prosecutor and\n(2) 5 Jur. 871. the other half to the municipality. (C. S. C. 1859, ch. 95 sec. 1). If the intention of the Canadian Legislature had been to make them crimes it would have made use of the language of the section following for the punishment of \" betting and pool selling,\" in which it is declared that the offender shall be guilty of a mis demeanour and liable to fine and imprisonment (R. S. C. oh. 159, sec. 9).\nIt is so clear that, up to that time, the Canadian legislature intended to consider lotteries merely as being of a purely local or municipal character, that several exceptions were made in the first place in favour of bazaars for charitable purposes approved by municipal authority, and then in favour of art societies. The first time that lotteries were prohibited as crimes in Canada was when the Criminal Code of 1892 was brought into force in 1893 and at the same time an end put to the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures, for the Parliament of Canada may validly declare anything, even the most innocent local or private matter, to be a crime. But in this case the contracts which are attacked were signed before the coming into force of the Criminal Code, under the authority of a provincial law adopted with that precise object. In 1890 the legislature of Quebec passed a statute (53 Vict. oh. 36), which permitted the operation of a lottery for the purpose of establishing any institution of public interest, or for instruction, on the condition, however, that, if it should be of a permanent character, the sanction of the Lieutenant Governor in Council should first be obtained This sanction was duly granted to the appellant on the 30th of June, 1890, modified of the 24th of September, 1892, and finally revoked on the 15th of October of the same year.\nThe contention of the appellant is that the legislation of the Province of Quebec is ultra vires, because, It is said, before Confederation, the laws concerning lotteries were part of the body of the criminal law of Canada, which, by the Confederation Act of 1867, became subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. I cannot accept the first part of this proposition. The law, prior to the Criminal Code 1892 forbids lotteries, it is true, but not as a crime, either expressly or impliedly, by declaring, as did the Imperial Parliament and the legislatures of almost all the States of the American Union and also the Penal Code of France that all lotteries were public nuisances or misdemeanours or d\u00e9lits (Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 1 ed. vo. l lottery,\" p. 1172; Gilbert sur Sirey, Code Penal, Arts. 410, 464,475 and notes). They are simply prohibited and punishable in a summary manner in the same way as an infinity of other offences or breaches of regulations which are undoubtedly under provincial jurisdiction, for example, offences against municipal by-laws, against good order, public health and safety of the province, respecting constables, bailiffs and public officers in the province, and the laws relating to hunting and fishing, asylums for the insane, licenses, manufactures, mines, the practice of pharmacy, provincial and municipal elections and so forth, which are always punishable in a summary manner before justices of the peace. Reg. v. Wason ([25]).\nIn my humble opinion the distinction between penal offences or simple contraventions and crimes or indict able offences presents itself as a condition of our federal system and from this point of view the promulgation of our criminal code was no doubt a national benefit Before the code the criminal law recognises three kinds of crimes, treason, felony and misdemeanour but all were indictable. Owing to this, the code did not preserve the former distinction; to-day all crimes in Canada are indictable offences, even although a certain number may be prosecuted in a summary manner before justices of the peace. But, before the code lotteries were not indictable and consequently, in view of the codifier, were not crimes. It was necessary to have a special enactment to render them criminal.\nA great number of English precedents have been cited to establish that, under the common law all infractions of laws of public order were misdemeanours. As many can be cited to the contrary effect. Chief Justice Harrison has carefully analysed them all in Beg v. Roddy ([26]). The learned Chief Justice concludes that they cannot possibly be reconciled. It must be admitted that the English jurisprudence upon this point is in a deplorable state of confusion which cannot be overcome save by codification of the criminal law.\nThe tendency of the more recent decisions is that the old definition of crime by Blackstone is too large and that a crime\nis more accurately characterised as a wrong, directly or indirectly affecting the public to the commission of which the state has annexed certain punishments and penalties and which it prosecutes in its own name in what is called a criminal proceeding. (Am. & Eng. Encycl. of Law, (2nd ed.) 1898, vo. \"Crime,\" pages 248 et seq.)\nOne of the last commentators of Blackstone adds that a misdemeanour does not include\na multitude of unclassified offences of which inferior magistrates such as justices of the peace, police magistrates and the like, have exclusive jurisdiction. (Lewis on Blackstone ed. 1897, pages 4 and 5 where a number of authorities are collected.)\nIn Attorney-General v. Radloff ([27]) Baron Martin said:\nThere are many crimes properly so called which are liable to be punished on summary conviction. But there are a vast number of acts which in no sense are crimes, which are also so punishable; such for instance as keeping open public houses after certain hours, and a variety of breaches of police regulations which will readily occur to the mind of any one. The bringing tobacco into this kingdom is of itself a perfectly innocent act, but the requirements of the public revenue, which induce the legislature to impose a very high duty upon the article, probably render it a matter of necessity that the bringing it into the kingdom without payment of the duty should be subjected to a penalty But this cannot affect or alter the intrinsic and essential nature of the act itself and it seems to me that it cannot be denominated a \u2018 crime,' according to the ordinary and common usage of language and the understanding of mankind. The proper meaning of 'crime' is an indictable offence.\nIt is true that the opinion of Baron Martin did not prevail, the judges being equally divided. But it was recently approved by the English Court of Appeal in the celebrated case of the Attorney-General v. Brad laugh ([28]). Lord Justice Brett said at page 688:\nIf I had been a member of the court at that time I should have-seen no answer to the reasoning of Martin B. in that case and I should have been of opinion in that case that an information for a penalty on the revenue side of the Court of Exchequer could not at any time, unless there were special and clear words in an Act of Parliament saying it was so, be considered as a criminal proceeding.\nAt page 686 His Lordship also says:\nIt has been at different times during this argument contended before us on both sides for different purposes, that the third section of the Parliamentary Oaths Act, 1866, imposes on every member a legal obligation to take and subscribe the oath and that if a member does not take and subscribe the oath in the manner therein set forth an indictment will lie against him on that section alone as for a misdemeanour and that the penalty in the fifth section is cumulative Wherever an Act of Parliament imposes a new obligation, and in the same Act imposes a consequence upon the non fulfilment of that obligation, that is the only consequence. Therefore, it seems to me that the only consequence of voting as a member, without having taken the oath in the manner appointed, is that the member becomes liable to a penalty. If that be so no indictment will lie, and, as far as my judgment goes, nothing in the nature of a criminal proceeding can be taken upon this statute. The recovery of a penalty, if that is the only consequence, does not make the prohibited. act a crime. If it did it seems to me that that distinction which has been well known and established in law for many years between a penal statute and a criminal enactment, would fall to the ground, for every penal statute would involve a crime, and would be a criminal enactment. In construing this Act of Parliament, I should on that ground alone say that no crime is enacted by this Act.\nThe head-note dealing with this part of the judgment is as follows:\nAn information at the suit of the Attorney-General to recover penalties under sec. 5 of the Parliamentary Oaths Act, 1866, from a member of parliament, for voting without having taken the oath of allegiance required by that statute, as amended by the Promissory Oaths Act, 1868, is not a 'criminal cause or matter' within the meaning of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, sec. 47.\nIt is contended that the mere fact of having inserted in the Consolidated Statutes of 1859 the Act concerning lotteries under the title \u201cCriminal law,\" in effect constitutes it a crime. Text writers have often said that the preamble of a statute may remove certain doubts as to the text but this is the first time that it has been pretended that the title or classification of a statute is to be construed as part of it Who would contend seriously that a public statute included by error or otherwise among the private statutes bound separately at the end of each volume of the statutes of each session of parliament could become, merely on this account, a private statute. For a similar reason, the insertion of statutes actually in force in a schedule of repealed Acts is of no consequence. (22 Vict. ch. 29, sec. 11, 1859; 49 Vict. ch. 4 sec. 10, 1886). Classifications are never absolute any more than marginal notes or references to formerly existing laws. Notwithstanding classification, we and an infinity of criminal offences outside the chap ter relating to criminal law, and in them we find a great number of simple breaches of municipal and police regulations, and even provisions in respect to civil and municipal law. See C. S. C. 1859, ch. 6 ss. 85, 86, 88 ; ch. 17, s. 55 ; ch. 29, s. 8; ch. 31, s. 55 : ch. 92, s. 80 ; ch. 93, ss. 25, 26, 27, 28 ; ch. 95, s. 3 : ch. 96, ss. 1, 13, 14.\nA statute must be construed by considering the import of the context. 22 Vict. ch. 29, ss. 8 and 9. In the present case, at least, the classification is a mere matter of form, a work of secondary consideration and simple convenience.\nBut even if the classification of the Consolidated Statutes of 1859 could have the effect which is claimed for it, it has not been continued in those of 1886 and it is under these latter that the nature of the offence of operating a lottery must be determined.\nIt has further been objected that the Interpretation Act of Canada, 1867, 31 Vict. ch. 1, s. 7, par. 20, has the effect of completing the statutory provisions relating to lotteries by declaring that the breach of any statute which does not constitute an offence of any other nature shall be a misdemeanour and punishable as such:\nAny wilful contravention of any Act, which is not made any offence of another kind shall be a misdemeanour and punishable accordingly.\nThis provision refers only to legislative acts of the Dominion of Canada (s. 3), and consequently cannot apply either to the statutes of the late Parliament of United Canada, nor to those of the provincial legislatures. It does not even effect ch. 159 of the Revised Statutes of Canada of 1886, which practically reproduces ch. 95 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada 1859, because it was not reproduced in the Interpretation Act of the Revised Statutes.\nBut, supposing that this provision is still in force, does it apply to a lottery? Is the offence of operating a lottery an undefined and unknown one? If the Revised Statutes had simply prohibited lotteries, if they had said nothing more, it might perhaps be contended that this simple prohibition made it a misdemeanour. But it is provided that the offended will incur a fine of $20 to be recovered in a summary manner before a justice of the peace, and this, in effect, defines the offence as being a simple contra vention. If the fine is paid there cannot even be imprisonment.\nFinally, by paragraph 21, the. Interpretation Act of 1867 declares that offences exist that are not misdemeanours.\nWhenever any wilful contravention of any Act is made an offence of any particular kind or name, the person guilty of such contravention shall on conviction thereof be punishable in the manner in which such offence is by law punishable.\nThe offence of holding a lottery has not perhaps any particular designation or name, but it is of a special nature or kind and is known under the general name of a simple penal offence or contravention.\nIt appears to me evident that the offence of operating a lottery was not a crime before the criminal code neither under the old statutes of Canada, nor in virtue of the laws enacted after Confederation, and that consequently it was a subject matter in respect to which the Provincial Legislature had authority to legislate.\nI cannot discover in it any of the characteristics of crime. I cannot see that a lottery in a municipality or even within a province can affect or be of interest to the whole country. Neither can I see any necessity for intervention by public authority for its prosecution and punishment. No infamy is attached to conviction, not even simple incarceration, much less imprisonment with hard labour. It is a matter, in my humble opinion, of a simple breach of regulations of a police or local nature, punishable by a light fine\u2014like an infinity of other offences within the jurisdiction of the province\u2014before local magistrates, for the advantage of the prosecutor who alone undertakes the responsibility of the prosecution, and who might even abandon it or make a compromise. I cannot conceive how I can declare criminal the commission of an act per mitted by the common law at least until constrained to do so by precise and positive statutory enactments. Crimes cannot be presumed; it is necessary to have a clear text of law to create them, and particularly so when in derogation of the common law.\nI am therefore of opinion that the legislation of the Province of Quebec concerning lotteries is constitutional, and consequently that the contract upon which the respondent bases his action is valid. I find less difficulty m arriving at this conclusion inasmuch as the appellant has Hot thought proper to question the legality of that contract in his defence. Judging from the record it is only before this court that the appellant has seen fit to raise the question for the first time. And if it is true that a defence of this nature ought not to be received with favour, as the courts have declared upon many occasions, much more ought it to be so in a matter in which it has never been pleaded. Wallbridge v. Becket ([29]): Evans v. Moviey ([30]).\nThe appellant's only serious plea is an exception of compensation which very properly was rejected; but the mere production of such an exception constitutes an admission on the part of the defendants that the action and the contract upon which it is based are well founded.\nAnd further still, the appellant's claim for compensation is based upon the very deeds and contracts which are now complained of as illegal in the factum and oral pleadings before this court. The appellant actually alleges:\n17. Que les dits Brault et Labrecque, a partir du deux de novembre mil huit cent quatre-vingt-douze (1892) jusqu'au premier juillet mil huit cent quatre-vingt-treize (1893), exploit\u00e9 la dite loterie appel\u00e9e \" La loterie Mont-Royal,' comme agents et mandataires de la dite d\u00e9fenderesse et notamment le dit demandeur, tant en vertu du dit acte de conventions, en date du vingt sept (27) d\u00e9cembre mil huit cent quatre-vingt-dix (1890) et du dit acte de conventions en date du dix-neuf mars (19) mil huit cent quatre-vingt-douze (1892), qu'a l'occasion de ces actes et en continuation de leur mandat r\u00e9sultant de ces dits deux actes, pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice et avantage de la dite d\u00e9fenderesse.\nThen the appellant prays that the court may declare the demand of the respondent more then compensated, reserving for the surplus, still in virtue of the same deeds and contracts, the right of taking such further action as may be deemed proper.\nFinally, even supposing that the lottery m question was not authorised by competent authority, I am far from entertaining the opinion that the deed of the 19th March 1892 which formed the basis of the pre sent action, is affected. by the illegality of the lottery. It is not this deed which provides for its organization or for its operation, but the other deed of the 27th December, 1890, which is not mentioned in the latter, except in an incidental manner. The deed of 1892 is an ordinary contract of loan, distinct from the first agreement, the duration of the lottery organised by virtue of the first deed being merely mentioned for the purpose of fixing the date for the repayment of the loan and the rate of interest. There is no question of a loan \"by any lottery, ticket, card or other mode of chance whatsoever,\" which the laws of Canada have in view. (0. S. C. 1859, ch. 95, s. 3; R. S. C. 1886, ch. 159, s. 4). The appellant received from the respondent $30,000 in one sum in current money which was the property of the respondent and his partner, before the commencement of the lottery operations, and simply promised to return this sum with a rate of interest varying from four to five per cent, according to the duration of the lottery. That is all. Before the loan. this sum was on deposit at interest in a bank to the credit of the respondent and Labrecque, his partner, (from whom he subsequently acquired all rights) as a guarantee for the due execution of the obligations stipulated in favour of the appellant. It is to-day contended that the appellant should keep this sum during a term of years without interest. It is even suggested in the factum that perhaps the appellant need not return the capital, except on the principle of the moral obligation\u2014which is not always true in law\u2014 \u201cthat no one may enrich himself at another's expense.'\u2018 Common honesty should at least require the appellant to offer to the respondent the interest that he and his partner were receiving from the bank upon these same funds at the time they were borrowed by the appellant, not for the purpose of operating a lottery, but to complete the construction of the \u201cMonument National.\"\nIt matters not whether the appellant and the respondent have or have not operated an illegal lottery; that could not prevent one of the parties from lending his own monies to the other at any legal rate of interest which might be. stipulated. Clark v. Hagar ([31]); 15 Am. & Eng. Encycl. of Law, (2 ed.) p. 912, vo. \u201cIllegal contract.\"\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: B\u00e9qu\u00e9, Lafontaine, Turgeon & Robertson\nSolicitors for the respondent: LaMotte & Trudel.\n[1] 7 App. Cas. 136.\n[2] Q.

J. and Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick and Girouard JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH PROVINCE OF QUEBEC, APPEAL SIDE.\nPractice on appeal\u2014Supplementary evidence\u2014Objections not taken at trial\u2014Amendment of pleadings\u2014Abandonment of expropriation\u2014Measure of damages\u2014Costs.\nOn the hearing of the appeal, objection was taken for the first time to the sufficiency of plaintiff's title, whereupon he tendered a supplementary deed to him of the lands in question.\nHeld, following The Exchange Bank of Canada v. Gilman (17 Can. S. C. R. 108) that the court must refuse to receive the document as fresh evidence cannot be admitted upon anneal\nHeld, also, that the defendant could not raise the question as to the sufficiency of the plaintiff's title, for the first time, on appeal.\nIn this care it appeared that the allegations and conclusions of the plaintiff's declaration were deficient and the court, under sec. 63 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, ordered all necessary amendments to be made thereto for the purpose of determining the real controversy between the parties as disclosed by the pleadings and evidence. Piche v. City of Quebec (Cass. Dig. (2 ed.) 497); Gorman v. Dixon (26 Can. S. C. R. 87) followed.\nThe city commenced expropriation proceedings and forthwith took possession of plaintiff's constructed works thereon and incorporated it with a public street. Subsequently, in virtue of a statute granting permission to do so, the city abandoned the expropriation proceedings without paying indemnity or returning the lands so occupied and used.\nHeld, that the plaintiff had been illegally dispossessed of his property and was entitled to have it returned to him in the state in which it was at the time it had been so taken possession of and also to recover compensation for the illegal detention.\nHeld further, that, in the present case, the measure of damages, as representing the rents, issues and profits of the lands usurped by the city should be the interest upon the value of the property during the period of its illegal detention.\nAPPEAL from the \"judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench Province of Quebec, appeal side ([1]), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe plaintiff is the owner of the lands abutting upon Notre-Dame Street, in the City of Montreal. The city, pursuant to powers under 52 Vict. ch. 79, (Que.) for widening the street in front of the plaintiff's land, prepared a plan showing the lands required according to sec. 207 of the Act, which was confirmed by the court, and the corporation thereupon became entitled upon compliance with the provisions of sec. 213 and paying indemnity, to obtain possession of the property and have it vested in the city without observing the formalities provided by the statute. The officers of the corporation forthwith took possession of the land, made a macadamized roadway over it, removed sidewalks, electric light poles, etc., back to the new line of the street, and Opened it to public traffic and since then, 1894; retained possession of the property, but the city abandoned the expropriation proceedings, which had been instituted, upon the passing of the Act, 59 Vict. ch. 49, s. 17 and offered to return the property to the plaintiff in the condition in which it then existed.\nThe plaintiff then instituted this action to recover the value of his property as having been illegally usurped by the city and for damages and obtained judgment in the Superior Court District of Montreal for $3,436.00 with interest and costs. The appeal is from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench appeal side, by which the trial court judgment was affirmed; Hall and Gourmet JJ.dissenting.\nAtwater Q.C. and J. L. Archambault Q.C. for the appellant. The city is not responsible for acts of its officers prematurely done pending expropriation. The abandonment of the proceedings was not the voluntary act of the appellant; it was done in obedience to the directions of an Act of the legislature and plaintiff is entitled to no damages, but only to have his property returned to him. See Dillon, Municipal Corporations, par. 474. This has been tendered by the city. In any case the plaintiff has not proved title to the sole ownership of the land and his proceedings and proof of title are insufficient to entitle him alone to maintain the action. He is not entitled to damages as his land was subject to the servitude exercised as a matter of public utility; he has not suffered in any greater degree than other owners affected by the improvements and cannot complain.\nFitzpatrick Q.C. (Solicitor-General), Archer with him, for the respondent. Our claims rest on arts. 407 and 1053 C. C. We refer also to the discussion of the question of liability of corporations in Mignault's Droit Civil Canadien, vol. 2, pp. 343 et seq. and to Doyon v. La Paroisse de St. Joseph ([2]) ; Soulard v. City of St. Louis ([3]) ; Watson v. Bennett ([4]). The proper measure of damages is the value of the land taken; Mueller v. St. Louis and Iron Mountain Rd. Co. ([5]); Jones v. Gooday ([6]); Thayer v. City of Boston ([7]).\nAs to the question of title the respondent now tenders an absolute deed of the interest of the other grantee (Beaufort) to him which was not put in at the trial the defendant having admitted the title by the pleas offering to give back the lands to plaintiff, Chavigny de La Chevroti\u00e8re v. City of Montreal ([8]); Childs v. City of Montreal ([9]); Leveill\u00e9 v. City of Montreal ([10]).\nThe jugement of the court was delivered by:\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The contention was put forward by the appellants at the hearing of this appeal that as by the deed of ownership of the property in question filed at the trial by the respondent as his title thereto, the sale thereof appears to have been made not to him alone but to him and one Beaufort jointly, he, the respondent, could not alone bring this action as he has done. To meet this objection, the respondent thereupon tendered a deed of assignment by Beaufort to him of all his rights in the property. We could not, however allow the production of this document, as it has been the constant jurisprudence of this court not to receive here any new evidence whatever. Exchange Bank of Canada v. Gilman ([11]). But the appellants cannot now avail themselves of an objection of this nature that was not taken at the trial where, upon the necessary amendment of the declaration, the evidence to meet such objection could have been brought. They by their pleas, acknowledge the respondent's title to the property by offering to return it to him. And for them at this stage of the case to turn round and ask for the first time the dismissal of his action on the round that he has not proved his title is what cannot be allowed.\nNow as to the merits of the appeal\nThat the respondent has been illegally dispossessed of this property and that he is entitled to revendicete it cannot now be controverter by the appellants. A municipal corporation, it is needless to say, has no right to acquire real property except in the cases and in the manner provided by the statute from which it derives it powers. The allegations and conclusions of the declaration, as it reads now, are undoubtedly deficient but we order such amendments to be made thereto \" as are necessary\" (to use the express words of sec. 63 of the Supreme Court Act) \" for the purpose of determining the real controversy between the parties as disclosed by the pleadings and evidence. \" Pich\u00e9 v. City of Quebec ([12]); F\u00e9rrier v. Tr\u00e9pannier ([13]); Gorman v Dixon ([14]); Williams v. Leonard & Sons ([15]) ; Lumbers v. Gold Medal Furniture Manufacturing Co. ([16]).\nAnd upon such amendments being now considered as having been made we order judgment to be entered declaring the respondent proprietor of the property in question, and ordering the appellants to put him, the respondent, in due possession thereof in the same state as it was when they took possession of it, within fifteen days after the signification of this judgment.\nThis aforesaid part of the judgment may be unnecessary, as it appears that since the case was heard the appellants, upon the suggestion of the majority of the court, have, on the 21st day of September last, put the respondent in possession. However, there can be no objection to its being entered.\nThere remains the question of the amount which the respondent is entitled to as compensation for the illegal detention of his property. Upon the amendment made and on the evidence of record we think that interest on the uncontradicted value of the property, $3,436, from the time the appellants illegally entered into possession thereof, 1st September, 1894, to the 21st September last, if they then did give it up to the respondent, or to the date when they will give it up, if that has not yet been done is under the circumstances, the proper measure of damages, as representing the fruits et revenus thereof, the appellants having detained it in bad faith with interest on the amount of the aforesaid interest now accrued from this date till payment.\nAs to costs, considering the tyrannical conduct of the appellants and the flagrant illegality of their doings in the matter, we order that all the costs in all the courts be paid by them to the said respondent.\nJudgment reformed, with costs against appellants.\nThe Chief Justice was prevented by illness from taking part in the judgment.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ethier & Archambault.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Charles Archer.\n[1] Q.

S. Rep. 549) affirmed. Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nThe material facts are stated in the judgments published herewith. The main question raised on the appeal was whether or not the defendant could without having pleaded it claim the benefit of the Statute of Frauds as avoiding the contract under which plaintiff claimed title to the goods for conversion of which the action was brought to which contract the defendant was not a party.\nThe trial judge gave judgment for defendant which was affirmed by the court en banc. The plaintiff appealed to this court.\nNewcombe Q.C. and Sedgewick for the appellant. The statute must be pleaded. Clarke v. Callow[2]; Olley v. Fisher[3]; Morgan v. Worthington[4]; James v. Smith[5]. Nor will the defence of the statute be allowed at the trial unless the plaintiff to a material extent changes front. Brunning v. Odhams Brothers[6]. Even if pleaded, the respondent being a stranger could not avail himself of the statute. Waters v. Towers[7]; Maddison v. Alderson[8], at p. 488, per Blackburn L.J.\nIn reference to the sufficiency of the contract at common law, delivery is not necessary to pass the title. As soon as a bargain and sale of specific personal property are concluded the contract becomes absolute without actual payment or delivery. Tarling v. Baxter[9]; Hinde v Whitehouse[10]; Clarke v. Spence[11]; Bentall v. Burn[12]. R. G. Code for the respondent. This court will not interfere with a decision such as is now appealed from as it is upon a mere question of procedure; Dawson v. Union Bank[13]; Gladwin v. Cummings[14]; Ferrier v. Tr\u00e9pannier[15]; Scammell v. James[16]; Williams v. Leonard & Sons[17].\nThe failure to plead the Statute of Frauds was not invoked at the trial and it is too late now to claim any benefit from it. Hart v. McDougall[18]; Horlor v. Carpenter[19]; Bauld v. Challoner[20]. The trial judge had power to amend for the purpose of determining the real question or issue raised by or depending on the proceedings; Order XXVIII, rule 12; and he would undoubtedly have ordered such amendment if objection had been raised at the trial to the pleadings. Dempster v. Fairbanks[21]; Power v. Pringle[22]; James v. Smith[23]. The plaintiff has no title to the goods, which were above the value of $40.00 and were not delivered to him, nor did he make payment, nor was there any memorandum in writing as required by the Statute of Frauds. Waters v. Towers[24]; is distinguishable, and in Smeed v. Ford[25] Crompton J. said: \"Waters v. Towers (12) seems to be treated as overruled in Hadley v. Baxendale\"[26].\nThis is not an action on contract and we are not properly speaking setting up the Statute of Frauds. Our contention is that every link in the plaintiff's title should be a good valid link, and that if the link in question is dependent on a contract which cannot be enforced, it is not a valid link. Britain v. Rossitter[27]; Sykes v. Dixon[28]; Benbow v. Low[29].\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Who owns the old sleigh and carriage in question, worth, at most, eighty dollars, which the appellant, who claims them, bought for fifty dollars, is the important question to be determined by the Supreme Court of Canada upon this appeal.\nWe hold with the two courts below that the appellant purchased the articles from one who had no right to sell them and the appeal is dismissed with costs.\nThe Maritime Provinces enjoy the costly privilege of bringing appeals to this court upon such paltry amounts. In a case from Prince Edward Island of Gorman v. Dixon[30], where one hundred and sixty dollars was the amount in controversy, the Chief Justice, speaking for the court, said:\u2014\nIt is to be hoped that some statutory amendment of the law may in the future prevent appeals to this court in cases of such very minor importance as the present in which the amount in controversy is so greatly disproportioned to the expense of the appeal.\nThese remarks have their full application in this case.\nThat such appeals should be possible is a blot upon the administration of justice. I hope the bar from the Maritime Provinces will assist in obtaining the necessary legislation to put an end to that state of things.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The plaintiff in his statement of claim alleges that he has suffered damage by the defendant wrongfully depriving the plaintiff of his goods and chattels, to wit: one double-seated sleigh and one light riding carriage, which the defendant wrongfully took and carried away and converted to his own use. The defendant in his statement of defence, pleads; first, that the said goods were not, nor was any of them, the plaintiff's; secondly, that the defendant did not at any time deprive the plaintiff of the said goods; and, thirdly, that at the time the defendant took the said goods, they were the property of one Arthur A. Archibald and not of the plaintiff and that in taking the goods the defendant acted by the authority and as the servant or agent of the said Archibald.\nThe plaintiff replied by joining issue to this defence and he also pleaded a special replication to the defendant's third plea.\nThis replication, Mr. Justice Ritchie was of opinion, was wholly unnecessary and irregular. It may not have been necessary for there is little or no difference between the modern and the former mode of pleading in actions for the conversion of goods. The first two paragraphs or pleas in the defendant's statement of defence are precisely similar in substance to the old pleas of \"not guilty\" and that the property was not the property of the plaintiff; and, under those pleas, all matters in difference of title could be given in evidence. It may, therefore, be that the special replication in the present case was unnecessary, but inasmuch as the plaintiff's title, if any he had, was acquired from a person, not the absolute owner of the goods but having only a qualified title to them under the true owner, and so that his title, if any, was derived under and in virtue of ch. 92, R. S. N. S. (5 ser.), I cannot say that it was improper for the plaintiff to plead a title under that statute as a purchaser for valuable consideration without notice.\nThe special replication is pleaded to the defendant's third plea and, in short substance, is that Arthur A. Archibald's sole title to the goods in question was by virtue of an unfiled and secret bill of sale thereof and that the same was and is under chapter 92, R. S. N. S., void against the plaintiff for that Lindsay as administrator of Nelson, without any notice or knowledge of the claim or title of Archibald, sold the goods for good and valuable consideration to the plaintiff, who likewise had no notice or knowledge of such claim.\nI concur, however, with the learned judge that the rejoinder filed by the defendant to this replication served no useful purpose, for all the matters therein alleged otherwise than by way of repetition of his denial of the plaintiff's title to the goods, were matters of evidence in support of the defendant's plea of title in Archibald.\nNow, at the trial, it appeared that within four days after Nelson's decease, one Lindsay and the plaintiff, who lived about sixteen miles from where Nelson had lived and died, came out together to the deceased's place claiming to be creditors of the deceased and wanting to see about his property, and they found one Chisholm Nelson, a cousin and brother-in-law of the deceased, in possession of his effects.\nThe plaintiff on that occasion went into the barns where the carriage and sleigh in question were and saw them there. Lindsay entered into conversation with Chisholm and asked him if he would administer to the deceased's estate, saying that if he, Chisholm, would not, he would. Chisholm replied that he would Jet him know in a few days, which he did, and within two or three days executed some papers renouncing administration.\nChisholm said that he told Lindsay that he thought the defendant had a claim against the carriage and sleigh. Lindsay replied that it was hard to tell whether he had or not; that he, Chisholm, told him that he thought there was an agreement; that Lindsay said, \"some people would do most anything.\" Chisholm also said that as soon as deceased was buried he had locked up the deceased's goods in the barn and kept it locked until the defendant got possession of the carriage and sleigh, which he did, as also appears in the evidence, from Chisholm himself, on production of the paper showing Archibald's title to the goods. And he said further that Lindsay had told him not to let the defendant have the property unless he had a written agreement.\nLindsay, who besides the plaintiff himself was the plaintiff's sole witness, said that he had made no inventory of the deceased's effects before receiving the letters of administration and that the carriage and sleigh in question were not included in an inventory made after receiving the letters of administration, which he received by mail on the 17th of March, 1899.\nHe admitted also that he had heard that the deceased had got the carriage and sleigh from the defendant whom he knew to be a person employed in selling carriages and sleighs; that he did not know how the deceased had bought these; he said further that he himself had never seen the carriage before he sold it and the sleigh as he said he did to the plaintiff on the 17th of March. He had seen the sleigh on the day when he went out with the plaintiff before receiving the letters of administration.\nNow the facts of what he calls a sale to the plaintiff are these. He says that the plaintiff never got possession of the goods; that the defendant had taken them away before he could do so; that plaintiff did not pay anything for them nor did he give any note for the price; that he took the plaintiff's word that he would pay fifty dollars at the expiration of nine months: that he sold on the seventeenth of March, because he thought that he had got a good chance to do so; that he had not seen the goods after receiving the letters of administration before this sale to the plaintiff; that he told the plaintiff that the goods were locked up in a building owned by the deceased; the key, he said, was at the house of the deceased's brother-in-law, (Chisholm Nelson); that a few days after this sale he and the plaintiff went out together to this brother-in-law's house, which was seven miles from where the goods were, for the purpose of getting the key, but did not get it, and that, in consequence thereof the plaintiff did not get the goods.\nBut at this time the goods were restored by Chisholm Nelson to the defendant's possession, for Lindsay said that not having got the key they did go on to where the goods were but that he and the plaintiff returning home met the defendant on the road driving the carriage; that neither he nor the plaintiff then made any claim to the carriage; that although he, Lindsay, had some conversation with the defendant who told them that he had received the sleigh also and was about to sell it, yet that he cannot say that the plaintiff said anything at all.\nThe plaintiff having been called in his own behalf, said, that Lindsay, after he was appointed administrator, sold him the carriage and sleigh in his, Lindsay's, own store at Middle Musquodoboit on the seventeenth of March, 1899, for fifty dollars, payable in nine months; that the carriage and sleigh were then at Moore River; that Lindsay asked him if he would go out to Moore River and get them; that he, plaintiff, asked if they were all right there, to which Lindsay replied that the barn was locked and that nobody could get them; that plaintiff said he would go out and get them the first of the week. Then he added. \"I heard that the defendant was going to take the carriage and sleigh and I started out with Lindsay to get ahead of him but we were too late; on the road we met the defendant.\"\nThen, as to what took place on that occasion, he said:\nLindsay and the defendant were talking about the property. The defendant said that he had taken them away, I understood, before that. I said nothing to the defendant about the property; he, Lindsay, did not speak to the defendant of the carriage being his or mine.\nThe plaintiff denied that he had any notice of Archibald or anyone having a claim on the carriage or sleigh.\nThe defendant shewed Archibald's title to the goods and produced the leases or bills of sale in virtue of which Nelson had held them in his lifetime, which reserved the property in Archibald until payment in full, and he proved that upon the sleigh no payments had been made and that nearly half of the rental of the carriage remained unpaid. He also proved the authority of Archibald for him to do all that he had done in the premises, and he testified that he, as agent for Archibald, took from Nelson his signature to the papers, and that he re-took possession. He found them, he said, in deceased's barn when he went for them; that he found Chisholm Nelson in charge of the building; that he had the key and that he showed the papers, (of title), to Chisholm Nelson, who at defendant's request came and opened the door and allowed the defendant to take the carriage and sleigh away.\nHe said that the second day after he had taken them away he met the plaintiff and Lindsay on the road; that Lindsay asked him by what authority he had taken the goods, to which the defendant replied, that if he, Lindsay, would come to town, Mr. Archibald would shew his authority; that Lindsay said: \"I will find out what authority he had for taking them, if you are without it;\" that plaintiff was sitting in the same waggon with Lindsay during this conversation but said nothing at all, and the witness finally told them that, if they would pay what was against the goods, they could have them.\nAt the close of the plaintiff's case, before the defendant entered upon his defence, defendant's counsel moved for judgment for the following reasons:\n1. That the sale was void under the statute of frauds;\n2. No delivery;\n3. No payment; no writing;\n4. No delivery before or after Lindsay appointed administrator.\nThe contention of the plaintiff's counsel as to the objection of the statute of frauds, was that no person but a party to the contract could raise that objection.\nThe learned trial judge after the close of the defendant's evidence and arguments of counsel rendered judgment for the defendant, holding that it was competent in the present action for the objection to be taken by the defendant, and he held that the plaintiff never having had any possession, and not having title in writing, under the statute of frauds, could not recover in this action.\nFrom this judgment the plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and there changed the frame of his contentions, which then, was not that a stranger to a contract could not raise any objection to the plaintiff's title as being defective for non-compliance with the statute of frauds, but that he was bound to plead the statute, and that the defendant, not having done so, could not object to any defect appearing in the plaintiff's title by reason of non-compliance with the statute.\nThis alteration in the plaintiff's contention never should have been entertained, for, if the plaintiff's objection had assumed that shape at the trial, the learned judge should have, and undoubtedly would have, under the circumstances appearing at the trial, intervened by allowing the plea to have been then pleaded, whether necessary or not, and so have avoided the scandal of an appeal in a case like the present, involving a claim by the plaintiff to the amount of fifty dollars, in a case where he had not paid a cent nor bound himself by any note or other instrument to pay a cent for the property in question in the event which has happened of his never having had the property delivered to him.\nThe ends of justice will, I think, be attained, if we dismiss the present appeal upon this ground alone, although, as the case has been argued both in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and before us, I must say, that in my opinion, there is really no material difference between the present and the former mode of pleading, or in the evidence necessary to support such pleading, or in the practice on the trial of a case of conversion.\nWhen defendant denies the actual taking of the goods from the plaintiff, and also the plaintiff's property in the goods, the case is wholly at issue, and nothing remains but evidence of title which the plaintiff in order to recover must prove to be in himself by an unquestionable title, and if an instrument in writing is necessary, under the circumstances appearing in evidence to make his title perfect as against the defendant, he must prove such instrument or fail, and, if he should make default in showing a perfect title, it is quite competent for the defendant still, as it always was, to point to such defect in the plaintiff's title, and to insist upon it.\nUntil the defect became apparent, he could not have been required by a plea to point out a defect of which he cannot be assumed to have been aware. The defendant had only to support his own title, and anticipation of defects in the plaintiff's evidence produced by him of his title, constituted no part of the defendant's case or of the duty cast upon him.\nAll the cases which have been cited before us show that where the defendant was bound to plead the statute of frauds was in cases between the parties to the contract, where one of the parties was seeking to enforce the contract against the other, and the language of Lord Blackburn in Maddison v. Alder son[31], shows that it is in relation to a case instituted by one of the parties to a contract against the other to enforce the contract, he is speaking, when he says that a defendant must plead the statute. And Chief Baron Kelly, in Clarke v. Callow[32], and Lord Cairns in Hawkins v. Lord Penrhyn[33], explain why a party to a contract who is sued by the other party to enforce it must plead the statute of frauds, if he intends to rely upon it, because otherwise it could not be known whether or not he intended to shelter himself under the statute, or to waive his right to shelter himself under it.\nThis cannot apply to the case of a defendant in an action for the conversion of goods where title to the goods is the point in issue, in which action the defendant has nothing to do but to insist upon the plaintiff showing a title good in omnibus as against the defendant.\nIn a case like the present where the plaintiff had no title whatever to the goods in question unless he should prove, as he had undertaken to do upon the record, a good title under the provision of chapter 92 E. S. N. S. (5 ser.) he could not defeat Archibald's title unless he should establish beyond all reasonable doubt, a bona fide purchase for valuable consideration without notice, and I must say, that the evidence in the present case is in my opinion pregnant with doubts as to the bona fides of the transaction and as to what was the real bargain between the parties.\nThe non-insertion by Lindsay in any inventory of the deceased's effects; the time selected for the alleged sale to the plaintiff, immediately after the receipt by Lindsay of the letters of administration; the price fixed which was just about two-thirds of the amount due to Archibald and less than half the value set by the plaintiff upon the goods in this action; the deferring of the payment of that small sum for nine months, without even the security of a promissory note; the non-explanation of any reason for the hasty sale; the knowledge that Lindsay had not possession of the goods, not even possession of the key of the building in which Chisholm Nelson had them locked up ever since Nelson's death; the admission by the plaintiff that it was because he had heard of the defendant's intention to take possession of the goods that he and Lindsay hurried away to get the key with the intention of endeavouring to get ahead of the defendant; and the non-assertion by the plaintiff of any claim whatever to the goods when he and Lindsay met the defendant driving the carriage and when he said he had got the sleigh also and was about to sell it; all these things appear to me to point to the conclusion that the bargain between the plaintiff and Lindsay was an imperfect one and was not intended to be complete unless they should succeed in getting possession of the goods so as to enable delivery to be made of them to the plaintiff.\nThis question of getting possession and of delivery to the plaintiff had surely something to say to the postponement for nine months; that sum surely never could become payable in the event which has happened of the plaintiff never getting possession of the goods.\nOf the mala fides of Lindsay there can be no doubt. And I must say that the evidence affects my mind with the very gravest suspicions that the plaintiff was combining with Lindsay in an attempt to defeat the claim of Archibald or of some person known or believed to be the owner of the goods. Upon the plaintiff was cast the burthen of clearing up these doubts and suspicions and in my opinion he has failed to do so.\nThen there is another point. When Chisholm Nelson restored the goods to the defendant upon production of the papers under which alone the deceased had held them he acted either in the character of an executor de son tort or as agent of Lindsay, the administrator and by his authority, for Chisholm said that Lindsay told him not to give up the goods to the defendant unless he should produce a written agreement. That direction implied authority for Chisholm to give them up upon production of the written agreement. This Chisholm did, and thereby the uninterrupted possession of the goods got back to the owner in the terms of the agreement under which the deceased had held them. This restoration of the actual possession of the goods to the person having the property in them must supersede the agreement between Lindsay and the plaintiff as it appears in the evidence.\nFor the above reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. I will however add a few words in relation to actions of this description. When a plaintiff can only claim a title to goods under the provisions of chapter 92, R. S. N. S., or such like statute, by showing a bond fide purchase for valuable consideration without notice, I think that as equitable principles are now to govern in all actions of whatever form and as the plea of purchase for valuable consideration without notice owes its origin to courts of equity the least that should be required of a plaintiff should be conformity with the principles prevailing in equity, by his shewing that before he had notice of any adverse claim he had actually paid his purchase or such portion of it as would afford some guarantee of the bona fides of the transaction and that as in courts of equity upon such a plea he should have protection only as to the extent of the amount of his purchase money actually paid.

S. C. c. 135, s. 29 (b).\nIn an action by the lessee of lands leased for 4 years and 9 months at a rental of $250 per annum to have the lease cancelled as being simulated as he was at the time of the lease owner of the property leased:\nHeld, that no amount of $2,000 or upwards was in dispute, and that as the appeal did not relate to any title to land or tenements nor to annual rents within the meaning of sec 29 (b) of R. S. C. c. 135, it could not be entertained by the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Province of Quebec, appeal side, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, which maintained the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe nature of the action is stated in the judgment of the court delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Taschereau. On the hearing of the appeal:\u2014\nL. P. Pelletier Q.C. for the respondents, moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the action did not involve a sufficient amount nor raise questions of a nature to give the Supreme Court of Canada jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\nFilzpatrick Q. C. (Solicitor-General), and L. A. Taschereau for the appellants contra, contended that the action affected the title to the lands leased which the lessee, now appellant, claimed as purchaser.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTASCHERAU J.\u2014The plaintiff, appellant, is the lessee, and the respondent is the lessor in an authentic deed of lease, dated the 14th of October 1895, for four years and nine months at $250 a year. This action is to set aside that lease on the ground that it was a simulated deed and that the appellant was then and is now, the owner of the property mentioned in that deed. The Superior Court granted his conclusions, and annulled the lease. The Court of Appeal reversed that judgment, and dismissed the action. The plaintiff now appeals.\nThe respondent moves to quash for want of jurisdiction. It is on the appellant to shew that the Court has jurisdiction; Bugger v. Bocock ([1]); and he has failed to do so. The motion must be granted with costs as if made on the first day of this term.\nThere is no pecuniary amount in controversy between the parties amounting to the sum or value of two thousand dollars. There is no constitutional point involved, and the matter in controversy does not relate to any feet of office, duty, rent, revenue or any sum of money payable to Her Majesty, or to any title to lands or tenements annual rents or other matters or things where the rights in future might be bound. The word a annual rents\u201d we have held to mean \u201crentes fonci\u00e8res.\" And the title to the ownership of the property leased is not the matter directly in controversy; there is no res judicator thereupon by the judgment of the Court of Appeal; the matter actually in dispute governs; the collateral effect of the judg- ment is not to be taken into account.

We refer to Gingras v. Desilets ([1]) ; North British and Mercantile Insurance Jo. v. Tourvilie ([2]); Lefeunt\u00e9um v. Beaudoin ([3]); City of Montreal v. Cadieux ([4]); Home Life Insurance Co. v. Randall ([5]); Ph\u00e6nix Insurance Co. v. McGhee ([6]); arts. 498, 501, C. P. Q.\nLafleur Q.C. and Giroux for the respondent. The unanimous opinions of both the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Review (eight judges), are with us as against the trial judge and their views are amply supported by the weight of evidence of record and their concurrent findings ought to stand in this court See Montreal Gas Co. v. St. Laurent ([7]); S\u00e9n\u00e9sac v Central Vermont Railway Co. ([8]); Demers v. Montreal Steam Laundry Co. ([9]); George Matthews Co. v. Bouchard ([10]); Paradis v. Municipality of Limoilou ([11]). TASCHEREAU J.\u2014The appeal is allowed with costs and the action dismissed with costs for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard in the judgment of the court tobe delivered by him in which I concur.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014While I concur in the judgment of my brother Girouard, I desire to add a few words.\nIn a case like the present where the trial judge, who has heard all the witnesses give their evidence before him and who has thus had an opportunity which no court of appeal can have of estimating the credibility of the several witnesses and the value of all their evidence, has rendered his judgment, no judge sitting in review of, or in appeal from that judgment, upon matters of fact, ought to reverse that judgment, unless it is shown to be clearly wrong upon the evidence so taken ; and when an appeal is taken to this court from a judgment reversing such judgment of the trial judge (as in the present case), I must repeat an opinion I have expressed upon other occasions, that inasmuch as the statute which gives to this court its jurisdiction prescribes in express terms that this court shall hear the appeal and pronounce the judgment which, in our opinion, the court whose judgment is appealed from should have given it seems to me that in order to do so a duty is imposed upon us to exercise our judgment upon the evidence aid, upon this question, namely, whether it discloses sufficient to show that the Court of Review was justified in pronouncing the judgment of the trial judge, upon the facts in issue to be wrong and in substituting in its stead the judgment pronounced by them. And, in the best exercise of my judgment, I must say, upon the evidence, that I think they were not. Had I been sitting in review, I could not have concurred in that Judgment and I am bound by the statute to give here the judgment which, in my opinion, that court should have given.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal and dismissing the action with costs, for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014This is an action of damages brought by the respondents, the widow and children of the late Joseph Cot\u00e9, who met his death while engaged by the appellant as a common labourer in the excavation of a drain, in the Village of Granby, by the fault and negligence, it is alleged, of the appellant, in not using the necessary means to brace the trench where Cot\u00e9 was working. The corporation pleaded, among other things, that every precaution was taken to secure the safety of the workmen, and that the death of Cot\u00e9 was purely accidental, a fortuitous event which could not have been, and was not foreseen, inasmuch as at the spot where Cot\u00e9 was killed, the soil was hard-pan and did not require bracing.\nIt is admitted that the evidence is contradictory, four or five witnesses, principally co-workmen of Cot\u00e9, testifying one way, and as many, chiefly the officers in charge and expects, flatly contradicting them. The trial was held before a judge without a jury, the parties not having exercised the option both had for a trial by jury. The learned judge saw and heard all the witnesses. True, he throws no suspicion, in words, upon the character or credibility of either of them in particular; in fact he makes no remark upon their competency, manner or demeanour, although his formal judgment is accompanied by a full and elaborate opinion. He finally comes to the conclusion that the Witnesses for the defendant must be believed rather than those for the plaintiff and dismissed the latter's action wit costs:\nConsidering that it is established that the men employed by the defendant to direct and superintend said work were well trained, experienced and competent, and that they were provided with the requisite materials to brace said walls of the trench had they deemed it necessary to have done so.\nConsidering that it is established that bracing is the usual and the ordinary means employed to prevent the caving in of the side of such trenches, and that it is not usual or necessary to resort to bracing when the soil of the sides of the trench is composed of hard-pan.\nConsidering that it is established that bracing was not used in the trench, at the place where Cot\u00e9 was killed, because in the opinion of the directors and superintendents of said work it was not necessary to do so owing to the nature of the soil.\nConsidering that it is established that the cause of said accident was unexpected, unforeseen and extraordinary.\nConsidering that the defendant took all reasonable precautions and such as are usually employed on work of that kind, to prevent the occurrence of accidents, and that in consequence the death of Cot\u00e9 was due to causes which it could not reasonably be expected to foresee and provide against, doth, in consequence, dismiss plaintiff's action with costs\nAnd in his notes, the learned judge remarks:\nWere they, (the sides of the trench) reasonably, and according to the judgment and experience of men competent to judge, likely to cave in? For if they were, and then the defendant was bound to take the usual precaution to prevent such an occurrence, which it is admitted was bracing. That such an eventuality was contemplated is apparent; the engineer in charge was informed by the consulting engineers that the foreman who had charge of the pipe laying would, among other things, have the direction of the bracing; and it is explained that this refers to bracing whenever it was thought necessary in the opinion of the foreman. The defendant had provided within easy reach the requisite material for bracing; and bracing had already been resorted to in a place where, from the nature of the soil, it had been judged necessary. The foreman says he did not brace at the place where the accident occurred because the soil there was what is known as hard-pan,\" and that it is not necessary to brace in such soil, because from his experience hard-pan doss not cave in. He is supported in this view by Mr. Horner, who lives nearby, and who dug a well through the same kind of soil, and by Mr. Robertson, superintendent of municipal works of the Town of Westmount, who has had a large experience in connection with such work, who speaks very highly of the quali- fictions of the foreman, and who says he never does any bracing in a soil composed of hard-pan. With this evidence, and it has not been contradicted by plaintiff, can I say that defendant did not make use of the precautions ordinarily employed in such work? If, while working such soil, science, experience and judgment unite in saying that bracing is not necessary, can I say and ought I to say that defendant was imprudent and neglectful of its duty because it did not brace and therefore responsible for the death of the unfortunate Cote ? I cannot say so.\nThe respondent having appealed to the Court of Review these findings were set aside, and new ones, based upon the evidence of her witnesses were entered against the appellants, who were condemned to pay $3,200 and all costs:\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'il ressort de la preuve que la tranch\u00e9e dans laquelle le dit Cot\u00e9 travaillait au moment de l'accident, avait une profondeur de plus de 15 pieds ; que bien que cette tranch\u00e9e e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 ouvr\u00e9e \u00e0 travers un soi durci, on avait jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire d'en boiser les parois \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents endroits ; que cependant l'endroit o\u00f9 le dit Cot\u00e9 travaillait avait \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9 sans boisage sur une distance 70 pieds ; que Ia veille de l'accident (un dimanche) il \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9 une pluie abondante et la terre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tremp\u00e9e, ce qui d\u00e9termina la chute de quelques morceaux de terre durant l'avant-midi du lundi ; que le dit Cot\u00e9 a averti le contre-ma\u00eetre de la d\u00e9fenderesse de ce fait en lui exprimant des craintes pour sa propre s\u00fbret\u00e9, et celui-ci ne prit aucun souci de ces observations.\nConsid\u00e9rant que durant l'apr\u00e8s midi du m\u00eame jour, un morceau de terre dans lequel se trouvait une lourde roche se d\u00e9tacha de l'ouverture de la tranch\u00e9e et tomba sur le dit Cot\u00e9 dont la t\u00eate fut broy\u00e9e renversant en outre le nomm\u00e9 Couteux qui travaillait \u00e0 ses c\u00f4t\u00e9s et qui perdit pendant quelques temps l'usage de ses sens.\nConsid\u00e9rant que le dit accident est d\u00fb au fait que Ia d\u00e9fenderesse n'a pas suffisamment prot\u00e9g\u00e9 le dit Cot\u00e9 et ses autres employ\u00e9s dans i\u2019 ex\u00e9cution des travaux qu'elle leur avait confi\u00e9s etc\nThe appellant then appealed to the Court of Appeal, but without success; the judgment of the Court of Review was unanimously maintained. Mr. Justice White, speaking for the whole court, observed in conclusion: We must hold that the evidence of these disinterested witnesses (for plaintiffs) must outweigh, upon that point, any evidence coming from either Greco or Bradford, (witnesses for the defendants).\nWe are asked to restore the judgment of the trial judge. The respondent submits, on the contrary, that we should not disturb the findings of two courts upon mere questions of fact, supported by evidence, as undoubtedly they are in this instance, at least to a certain extent. Respondent refers to Montreal Gas Co. v. St. Laurent ([12]); S\u00e9n\u00e9 sac v. Central Vermont Railway Co. ([13]) * The George Matthews Co. v. Bouchard ([14]); Paradis v. Municipality of Limoilou [15]4). But in every one of these cases the judgment of the first court was upheld. True, in Deniers v. Montreal Steam Laundry ([16]), we dismissed an appeal from the Court of Appeal which had reversed the judgment of the Superior Court, but it was because there was no evidence whatever to support' it. For the same reason, this court, having to deal with the facts as well as the law involved in each case and to render the judgment which should have been rendered in the first court did not hesitate on a few occasions, to reverse the judgments of both the trial judge and of the Court of Appeal, but it was only when they were clearly against the evidence adduced. North British and JMercantile Ins. Co. v. Tourville ([17]); Lefeunt\u00e9um v. Beaudoin ([18]); City of Montreal v. Cadieux ([19]). See also AIlen v. Quebec Warehouse Co. ([20]).\nThe present case, however, differs from any of the cases above quoted, and I believe we never before had occasion to adjudicate upon a similar one. The two appellate courts proceeded as if they had to deal with an ordinary enqu\u00eate case, where the witnesses are not seen by the trial judge, and where the judges in appeal are in just as good a position as he was to weigh the evidence of record and arrive at a conclusion. Here the trial judge alone saw and heard the witnesses; he tells us, both in his formal judgment and in his notes, that the witnesses for the appellant are to be believed, and gives judgment accordingly, entirely ignoring the witnesses against the appellant, evidently because, in his own opinion at least, they were unsatisfactory either from interest, prejudice, incompetence, ignorance, or other cause, not specified, but nevertheless clearly implied from the judgment he pronounces. The learned judge names the witnesses upon whom he relies. It is not pretended that the evidence is clearly against his findings. Both parties before this court, as well as the appellate courts, treated it as contradictory, and all proceeded to discuss it pro and con. We think that the judgment of the first court ought to prevail. The Court of Review should not under the circumstances of the case, have interfered with it, and the judgment of the Court of Appeal refusing to restore it is clearly erroneous. See Cook v. Patterson ([21]).\nI do not propose to apply to a case like this the principles which govern jury trials. It is a well established rule that no court would disturb the verdict of a jury, unless it be clearly against the weight of evidence, and that a verdict is not considered against the weight of evidence unless it is one which the jury, viewing the whole of the evidence, could not reasonably find. (C. P. Q. Arts. 498, 501.)\nSo far, the courts of England and of this country have not given to the findings of a trial judge the effect of a verdict by a jury, because, it is argued, the latter is the result of a supposed agreement between the parties that the facts shall be decided by a jury. Jones v. Hough ([22]); Metropolitan Railway Co. v. Wright ([23]); Ph\u00e6nix Ins. Go. v. McGee ([24]). I must confess that I fail to appreciate the force of this reasoning. Is it not likewise in consequence of such a presumed agreement that, as in the present instance especially, both parties waived their right to a trial by jury and instead elected to submit their differences, both of law and of fact, to a judge sitting also as a jury? Probably, we have not heard the last word from the English courts. Trials of actions at law by a judge without a jury are yet in their infancy and it will not be surprising if, at no distant day we see the rule\u2014which has been adopted in all countries where findings of fact are left to the trial judge as France and nearly all the States of the American Union, namely, that such findings stand in the place of the verdict of a jury\u2014prevail likewise in England and in this country, as the most logical and practical. (Am. & Eng. Ency. of Pleading, 2 ed. vol. 2, p. 396). It is not without interest to observe the advance of the English jurisprudence in this regard within the last twenty years.\nIn Jones v. Hough, in 1879 (1), quoted with approbation by our learned Chief Justice in Phonic Insurance Co v McGhee (3), Lord Bramwell said :\nA great difference exists between a finding by a judge and a finding by a jury. Where the jury find the facts, the court cannot be substituted for them because the parties have agreed that the facts shall be decided by a jury; but where the judge finds the facts, there the Court of Appeal has the same jurisdiction that he has, and can find the facts whichever way they like.\nBut Lord Cotton added:\nOf course I need not say in all questions of fact, especially where there has been viv\u00e2 voce evidence before the judge in the court below, the Court of Appeal ought to be most unwilling to interfere with the onclusion which the judge has arrived at when he has had the opportunity, which the court have not, of seeing the witnesses, and judging of their demeanour.\nIn Colonial Securities Trust Co.v. Massey ([25]) which was an appeal from the judgment of a trial judge sitting without a jury, it was admitted that there was a con flit of evidence? Lord Esher M. R., speaking for the court, said:\nI am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. We must see first of all what is the rule of conduct of the Court of Appeal when hearing an appeal on a question of fact from the judgment of a judge trying a case without a jury. It cannot be shaped according to the rule of conduct of the Courts of Common Law before the Judicature Acts but must follow that adopted by the Courts of Appeal in Chancery because before that court only could an appeal from a judge sitting without a jury have then come. In the Courts of Equity the matter appealed against was the decision of a judge and for that reason such an appeal was called a rehearing, since the court could set aside the decree or judgment of the judge who had tried the case and pronounce another decree or judgment. The Court of Appeal in Chancery acted upon this rule, that they would not allow an appeal unless they were satisfied that the judge was wrong. If they were in doubt at the end of the argument whether the judge was right or wrong, since the burden of proof was on the appellant and he had not satisfied them that the judge was wrong, they dismissed the appeal That is the rule of conduct which we ought now to apply in this court. The judge in the court below may have heard witnesses; and if so the Court of Appeal would be more unwilling to set aside his judgment, especially if there was a conflict of evidence, than in a case tried on written evidence where the witnesses were not before the judge, because of the opportunity afforded of judging how far the witnesses were worthy of credit. Where witnesses are not examined before the judge but the case is determined on evidence taken on affidavit or examination not before the judge, or partly on one and partly on the other the Court of Appeal is not hampered by the consideration that the judge in the court below has seen the witnesses, whilst the Court of Appeal has not, and the rule of conduct would not apply so strongly but still this court would not reverse the judgment and give a different one, unless satisfied that the judge was wrong. In a still more recent case Coghlan v. Cumberland ([26]), Lord Lindley said:\nEven where, as in this case, the appeal turns on a question of fact, the Court of Appeal has to bear in mind that its duty is to re-hear the case and the court must reconsider the materials before the Judge with such other materials as it may have decided to admit. The court must then make up its own mind, not disregarding the judgment appealed from, but carefully weighing and considering it, and not shrinking from overruling it if on full consideration the court comes to the conclusion that the judgment is wrong. When, as often happens, much turns on the relative credibility of witnesses who have been examined and cross-examined before the judge, the court is sensible of the great advantage he has had in seeing and hearing them. It is often very difficult to estimate correctly the relative credibility of witnesses from written depositions; and when the question arises which witness is to be believed rather than another and that question turns on manner and demeanour, the Court of Appeal always is and must be, guided by the impression made on the judge who saw the witnesses. But there may obviously be other circumstances, quite apart from manner and demeanour, which may show whether a statement is credible or not ; and there circumstances may warrant the court in differing from the judge even on a question of fact turning on the credibility of witnesses whom the court has not seen.\nFinally, in the case of The Home Life Association v. Randall ([27]) which was decided by this court during the last October term our learned Chief Justice speaking for the whole court, said:\nIt is true that the question as to the cause of death is entirely one of fact and that there was contradictory expert evidence, but having regard to the deliberate statement in the declaration of the medical attendant, the absence of any attempt to explain and correct this until the trial, and other surrounding circumstances, we are all of opinion that it would have been very difficult to come to any other conclusion than one at variance with the finding of the learned Chief Justice. And we should not have been precluded from entering upon an examination of the evidence upon this head by the rule that a second court of appeal will not interfere with the concurrent finding of two preceding courts on a question of fact, a rule well established and often acted upon here as well as in the Privy Council and also in some late cases in the Supreme Court of the United States. In order to apply the rule referred, to it must appear however that the question of evidence has undergone consideration in both the court of first instance and the first court of appeal. That does not appear to have been the case since the learned judges of the Court of Appeal did not deal with the question of evidence but decided on other grounds. We are therefore in the position as regards this question of a first court of appeal and as the court was in the case of Jones v. Bough ([28]), which authority establishes generally the right of an appellant if the question is open to have the evidence taken on a trial without a jury reviewed on appeal.\nIf it all depended on the credit to be given to witnesses I should be of the same opinion as Mr. Justice Osler, but it is not a case altogether dependent on such consideration but rather on the inference to be drawn from surrounding facts not disputed and from documents in other words a question of circumstantial evidence complicated with the opinions of experts. Although all the learned brothers agree on this view, we decide the appeal upon the first point.\nFor the purposes of this appeal, it is not necessary to dwell any longer upon this point of procedure, however important it may be. It is sufficient to say that there is ample evidence to warrant the findings of the trial court. Employers are not the insurers ok the lives of their employees; they are only bound to take all and every means of precaution and protection generally used in similar establishments or occupations.

'99,1, 20.\nWe are therefore of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the respondent's action dismissed with costs before all the courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Amyrault & Duffy.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

C.\nAbout the time a dissolution of partnership was imminent one of the partners was accused of embezzlement of funds and, supposing that he was liable for an alleged shortage and under threat of criminal prosecution he signed a consent that the amount should be deducted from his share as a member of the firm He was denied access to the books and vouchers and some weeks afterwards, upon settlement of the affairs of the partnership, the amount so charged to him was paid over to the other partners. It was subsequently shewn that this partner had made his returns correctly and had not appropriated any part of the missing funds.\nHeld that he was entitled to recover back the amount so paid in an action conduction indebiti as both the consent and the payment had been made under duress and in error and further that there had. been no ratification of the consent to the deduction of the amount by the subsequent payment, because the denial of access to the books and vouchers caused him to continue in the same error which vitiated his consent in the first place, and, further, that, even if the consent given could be regarded as amounting to transaction it would be voidable on account of error as to fact\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, and maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe plaintiff, the defendant and another person carried on business together in partnership as manu- facturers in the City of Quebec and, shortly before dissolution of the firm, the other partners became suspicious in respect to the plaintiff's method of paying the factory hands and accused him of having appropriated about $9,000 of the partnership funds to his own use; criminal proceedings were threatened and the plaintiff was prevented by the other partners from making an examination of the books or vouchers. Under fear of this prosecution and its consequences to himself and family and erroneously supposing that shortages were chargeable to him, the plaintiff consented that $6,000 should be deducted from his share in the firm's property and, upon the division of the assets, a short time afterwards, the money was deducted from his account and $3,000 credited and paid to each of his partners.\nUpon subsequent examination of the books and vouchers the plaintiff discovered that he was not indebted, and, upon being convinced of the mistake which had been made, one of the partners returned the $3,000 he so received from the plaintiff, but defendant insisted upon retaining the $3,000 which had been said to him in an action conduction indebiti to recover the latter amount as having been paid in error and under duress the trial court judge dismissed the plaintiff's demande on the grounds that there had been no duress, and that there was consideration for the payment as a shortage had not been accounted for. On appeal this judgment was reversed and judgment ordered to he entered for the plaintiff, the Court of Queen's Bench considering that he had proved that his consent to the payment had been given under duress and through threats and artifice. The defendant now appeals.\nFitzpatrick Q.C. (Solicitor-General), and L. A. Cannon for the appellant. The payment was upon transaction and to avoid a lawsuit which was good and sufficient consideration. Admitting (what appellant denies) that the agreement constituted \u201ccompounding of felony,\" money paid under such an illegal contract cannot be recovered back. There was no duress or error and, even admitting that the contract was entered into through threats and compulsion, it was ratified by the respondent consenting, some months afterwards, that the amount charged against him should be paid to the appellant on the settlement of the partnership affairs.

Willoughby, (1900) 31 S.C.R. 33\nDate: 1900-11-12\nMatthew Ryan (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nWilliam Willoughby (Defendant) Respondent.\n1900: October 31; 1900: November 2, 12.\nPresent: Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick, King and Girouard JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Municipal work\u2014Condition as to sub-letting\u2014Consent of council.\nWhere a contract with a municipal corporation provides that it shall not be sub-let without the consent of the corporation it is incumbent on the contractor to obtain such consent before sub-letting, and if he fails to do so he cannot maintain an action against a proposed sub-contractor for not carrying on the portion of the work he agreed to do.\nIn an action against the sub-contractor the latter pleaded the want of assent by the council whereupon the plaintiff replied that the assent was withheld at the wrongful request and instigation of the defendant and in order wrongfully to benefit said defendant and enable him, if possible, to repudiate and abandon the contract. Issue was joined on this replication.\nHeld, that the only issue raised by the pleadings was whether or not the defendant had wrongfully caused the consent to be withheld and that the plaintiff had failed to prove his case on that issue.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] which affirmed the verdict for the plaintiff at the trial.\nIn 1895 the plaintiff, Ryan, entered into a contract with the Town Council of Carleton Place, County of Lanark, whereby he undertook to erect a town and fire hall for the sum of $23,320, the contract containing the following condition: \u201cThe contractor shall not sub-let the works, or any part thereof, without the consent, in writing, of the architect and corporation.\u201d\nIn the spring of 1896 the plaintiff and defendant entered into a sub-contract by which the defendant agreed to do the mason and brick work of the building for $3,700. The defendant was at the time a member of the town council. The sub-contract contained the following provision: \u201cIt is understood and agreed that this agreement, save as herein otherwise provided, is made subject to all the terms and conditions made and entered into by and between the said party hereto of the second part and the town of Carleton Place.\u201d\nThe plaintiff made no application to the council for its consent to the sub-contract but the defendant tendered his resignation as a member which was refused by resolution as follows:\n\u201cMoved by Mr. Begley, seconded by Mr. Cram, that this council decline to accept Mr. Willoughby as a sub-contractor under Mr. Ryan for the mason work of the town and fire hall, as we believe that his many years of practical experience will be of great benefit to the building committee in seeing that this contract is faithfully executed, and that being a member of this council he is disqualified to take such contract and that the clerk is hereby authorized to notify Mr. Ryan.\u201d\nA copy of this resolution was sent to the defendant who thereupon notified the plaintiff that he would be unable to perform the work for which he had agreed. The plaintiff therefore completed the construction of the building and brought action against the defendant for the cost of the mason and brick work in excess of the sum for which defendant had agreed to do it. In this action he charged defendant with having wrongfully procured the passage of the above resolution. The pleadings are set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne on this appeal.\nAt the trial the plaintiff obtained a verdict which was affirmed by a divisional court. The Court of Appeal, however, reversed the latter judgment and dismissed the action whereupon the plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court.\nShepley Q.C. for the appellant. Defendant had an interest in the contract within the meaning of the Municipal Act; Reg. v. Francis[3]; and had forfeited his seat in the council. Nutton v. Wilson[4]; Barnacle v. Clark[5]; Prince Election Case[6].\nAs to the obligation on plaintiff to obtain the assent of the council see Mackay v. Dick[7].\nWatson Q.C. for the respondent referred to Rashleigh v. South Eastern Railway Co.[8]; Day v. Singleton[9]; Le Feuvre v. Lankester[10].\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The plaintiff in his statement of claim alleges that prior to the 1st of May, 1896, he had entered into a contract with the Town of Carleton Place to erect and complete a town and fire hall for the corporation according to plans and specifications referred to in the contract. That on the 1st of May, 1896, he had entered into a sub-contract with the defendant for the performance by him of a portion of the said work. The statement of claim then avers performance by the plaintiff of all things necessary upon his part but that the defendant wholly neglected to perform his part though frequently requested so to do, whereby the plaintiff was obliged to perform the work himself at a cost double the price for which the defendant had contracted. This is the whole substance of the statement of claim. By way of defence the defendant pleaded in short substance as follows: That the plaintiff had entered into a contract with the corporation dated the 24th of October, 1895, for the erection and completion of a town and fire hall at Carleton Place. That it was made a term and condition of the said contract that the plaintiff should not sub-let the said work or any portion thereof without the consent in writing of the architect and the corporation. He admits that on the 1st May, 1896, he entered into an agreement with the plaintiff for the performance of a portion of the work subject to the terms and conditions contained in plaintiff\u2019s contract with the corporation and to complete such portion within three months after he should be, within one month from said 1st of May, notified by the plaintiff to proceed with the work. That defendant has always been ready and willing to proceed with the work, but that the plaintiff never did obtain the consent in writing of the architect and corporation to the sub-letting to the defendant of the said portion of the work, but that on the contrary the corporation refused to assent to the subletting to the defendant or to allow the defendant to proceed with the said work. To this statement of defence the plaintiff replied that the said corporation refused their consent to the sub-letting of the works in the statement of claim mentioned\nat the wrongful request and instigation of the defendant and in order wrongfully to benefit said defendant and enable him if possible to repudiate and abandon the contract made between him and the said plaintiff.\nUpon this replication the defendant joined issue, and upon the issue so joined the case went down for trial, the whole burthen of proving the issue being upon the plaintiff. At the trial the plaintiff produced the agreement of the 1st of May, 1896, between him and the defendant and he also proved that on the 16th May he had called upon the defendant to proceed with the portion of the work mentioned in the agreement of the 1st of May, and that on the 22nd May he had informed the defendant by letter that, as he had not proceeded with such portion, he, the plaintiff, would himself proceed with it and charge all extra cost to the defendant. Upon this the plaintiff rested his case without offering any evidence whatever upon his replication upon which the sole material issue to be tried was taken, and the burthen of proving which rested wholly on the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff not having produced his contract with the corporation, a copy of it produced by the defendant\u2019s counsel was accepted as correct. A resolution of the council of the 11th May, 1896, and a copy of a letter enclosing the same addressed by the town clerk to the plaintiff, also a letter dated the 6th May, 1896, and a further letter dated the 13th May from the plaintiff to the architect were put in by defendant\u2019s counsel and read.\nThe resolution of the 11th May was as follows:\nMoved by Mr. Begley, seconded by Mr. Crain, that the council refuses to accept Mr. W. Willoughby as a sub-contractor under Mr. Ryan for the mason work of the town and fire hall as we believe that by his many years of practical experience his services will be of great benefit on the building committee in seeing that this contract is faithfully executed, and that he being a member of this council is disqualified to take such contract and that the clerk is hereby authorized to notify Mr. Ryan.\nThis the clerk did by enclosing a copy of the resolution to the plaintiff in a letter dated the 12th May. Now the plaintiff never having offered any evidence of his having made any application whatever to the town council for the purpose of obtaining their con- sent to the plaintiff sub-letting to the defendant the portion mentioned in the agreement and having offered no evidence in support of his replication it does not appear why it should have been thought necessary to proceed any further with the case, or why judgment should not have been rendered for the defendant. The defendant however was called by his counsel on his own behalf and naturally had nothing of any importance to say upon his examination by his counsel, but the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was permitted as by way of cross-examination to subject the defendant to a very rigorous examination in the endeavour to obtain some admission from him in support of the matters alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s replication which constituted the sole issue in the case. The learned counsel for the plaintiff failed however to extract any thing from the defendant in support of the replication (as indeed the learned counsel for the appellant in his argument before us freely admitted) but he extracted from him that he was elected a councillor of the town of Carleton Place in January, 1896, and that he was on the building committee of that council, and that in the month of April, when plaintiff was dealing with him about taking the sub-contract, he had said that he should resign if he went into the contract; that on the 1st of May, when the agreement of that day was signed, he did not know it was a condition of the plaintiff\u2019s contract with the corporation that the plaintiff should not sub-let without the consent of the corporation\u2014that he learned that afterwards from one of the councillors\u2014that the matter was a subject of conversation on the streets\u2014that the councillors told defendant they would not let him go\u2014that he should not leave the council.\nMr. Begley, the mayor of Carleton Place in 1896, was called as a witness for the defence and he testified that the resolution of the 11th May, 1896, was passed upon his motion. The learned counsel for the defendant proceeded to examine him for the purpose of eliciting how the resolution came to be moved and passed with the view plainly of shewing that the defendant had nothing to do with it, and it may be also of shewing that the plaintiff had never applied to the council for their consent to the sub-letting contract, and of showing also how the council had acquired knowledge of the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant having been entered into. This inquiry bore very materially upon the issue joined upon the plaintiff\u2019s replication, but it was persistently objected to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel who insisted that no explanation should be given of the circumstances under which the resolution came to be moved and passed, and this objection was acceded to by the learned judge who refused to receive the evidence as irrelevant; and the testimony of seven others of the councillors offered upon the same point was objected to and rejected.\nThe only ground upon which such evidence could have been rejected appears to me to have been that as the onus to prove the affirmative of the issue joined upon the plaintiff\u2019s replication rested upon the plaintiff, and as he had offered no evidence in support of his replication it was quite unnecessary for the defendant to adduce evidence which should have the effect of proving the negative side of the issue, but it was not upon this ground that the evidence was rejected for upon the defendant\u2019s counsel offering no further evidence, judgment was immediately rendered for the plaintiff. But although the defendant was thus prevented from proving how the resolution came to be passed there is some evidence on the record before us from which we may gather grounds for a reasonable assumption of what were the circumstances occasioning the passing of the resolution. It was not passed in answer to any application by the plaintiff for the consent of the council to his sub-contract\u2014no such application was ever made by him\u2014that is admitted in the argument before us. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel had also objected to the defendant\u2019s counsel asking the defendant whether he had anything to do with it\u2014that objection was also acceeded to by the learned judge.\u2014How then could the council have had knowledge of the agreement of the first of May having been entered into? An answer to this question may perhaps be found in the plaintiff\u2019s letter of the 6th May, 1896, to the architect of the corporation wherein occurs this sentence:\nI have let the contract of the mason work to one of the building committee; the committee is willing he should get it. I will have them write you to that effect. This is a good move because he was one of the principal kickers.\nIt is not too much to suppose that this letter addressed to and received by the architect was communicated by him to the mayor and some one or more of the councillors which might account for the defendant having in his evidence stated that the fact of the plaintiff\u2019s contract containing a condition prohibiting sub-letting without consent of the corporation was first communicated to him by a member of the council and that the members of the council said they would not let him leave the council. It might account also for the objection taken by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to the evidence of the mayor and the seven councillors who might possibly have given evidence that this passage in the plaintiff\u2019s letter had opened their eyes to the importance of retaining the services of the defendant and of refusing their assent to the sub-letting contract in advance of any application by the plaintiff for their assent to it. We quite agree with the views expressed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario to the effect that the defendant\u2019s verbal promise to resign if he should go into the contract, evidence of which promise was got in the manner above stated, has nothing whatever to do with the issue joined in the present action. If the plaintiff had been advised that he had a good cause of action founded upon that promise and a breach of it, he should have asked leave to amend in the court in which this action was instituted. Whether or not, in view of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to prove the matter alleged in his replication, he could state a case founded upon that promise in which he would have better success than in the present action we are not called upon to express an opinion. But as to the argument pressed upon us upon a question whether the contract of the 1st of May being signed by the parties thereto, did or not constitute an avoidance of the defendant\u2019s seat in the council that is a matter quite irrelevant to the issue joined in the present action. For whether it had or had not such effect the plaintiff knew that the contract of the 1st of May did not constitute a binding agreement unless nor until the plaintiff should obtain the consent of the council, necessary to its validity, and the fact that he made no application for such consent, and the fact that in the present action he has failed to prove the truth of the matter pleaded by him in his replication would need have to be given their due weight in whatever form action might be instituted by the plaintiff in the premises.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nKING J.\u2014(Oral).\u2014I agree to the dismissal of the appeal but I wish to confine the reasons to a single ground. It was a condition precedent of the contract which the plaintiff seeks to enforce that he should obtain the consent in writing of the architect and of the corporation to the sub-contract, and in this he wholly failed. This went to his capacity to enter into the contract. The consent of the corporation could be effectually given without the necessity of Willoughby taking part in it, and, therefore, the observations at page 263 in Mackie v. Dick[11], are not applicable. The reasons given by the corporation are not material. They were not bound to give any reasons, and whatever may be surmised, it is not proved that Willoughby was instrumental in procuring their refusal or took any part in the proceedings of the corporation in respect thereto. Although he was present at the council meeting he sat amongst the spectators.\nTASCHEREAU, SEDGEWICK and GIROUARD JJ. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal for the above reasons.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lavell, Farrell & Lavell.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Colin McIntosh.\n[1] 27 Ont.

The present action was against the mother and collateral representatives of the deceased for the cancellation of two policies of insurance on the life of deceased payable to his wife should she survive him otherwise to his legal representatives. Assured was murdered by his wife and her lover who were both convicted and executed for the murder.

Such action may properly be taken in the name of the Pharmaceutical Association of the Province of Quebec.\nIt is improper in such an action to describe the subsequently charged offences as second offences under the statute as a second offence cannot arise until there has been a condemnation for a penalty upon a first offence charged.\nThe sale in the Province of Quebec, by an unlicensed person, of drugs by retail, whether or not such drugs be poisonous, or partially composed of poison, or absolutely free from poison, is a violation of the prohibition contained in Art 4035 Revised Statutes of Quebec whether or not the articles sold be enumerated in the \"Quebec Pharmacy Act\u201d as poisonous or as containing an enumerated poison.\nJudgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Q.

P. Pelletier (Q.C. and Brosseau Q.C. for the appellant.\nThe judgment of the court ordering the hearing to proceed was delivered by:\nTaschereau J.\u2014(Oral).\u2014The mere fact of a constitutional question having been raised in the pleadings entitled the appellant to enter his appeal, and that appeal having been properly brought, the whole case on the appeal remains at large and within the jurisdiction of this court. The appellant cannot be deprived of his right to appeal by the withdrawal of the plea of ultra vires. The hearing upon the merits is ordered to proceed.\nThe circumstances of the case and questions at issue upon the merits of the appeal are stated in the judgments reported.\nL. P. Pelletier Q.C. and Bosseau Q.C. for the appellant. The amending Act passed pending this litigation cannot affect the proceedings it cannot be construed retrospectively; Maxwell, Statutes (3ed.) pp. 588, 589; 50 Vict. ch. 5 s. 7 (Que.); R. S. Q. Art. 11; Couture v. Bouchard ([4]); Williams v. Irvine ([5]).\nThe penalties imposed constitute debts due the association and may be joined and sued for together. They are in no sense fines to be sued for by qui tarn action and as the united sums form an amount within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, it is a competent tribunal in which the plaintiff may sue in its own name, as in an action for debt.

On the other hand the respondent has proved that he carries on a wholesale drug business and has in his employ a lic\u00e9nciate of pharmacy. He neither retails drugs nor fills prescriptions. The sales made were in the course of his wholesale business. We invoke the amending Act 62 Vict. ch. 35 as retroactive and a bar to the action; 1 Demolombe, no. 64, 65; Dal.

In any case the proof can only justify a con damnation for one first offence0, but the patent or pro praetor medicines sold, although containing morphed and strychnine had them in such minute quantity that they are not poisonous, and consequently do not come within the scope of art. 4035 R. S. O. and being patented and not dangerous to health or to human life, their sale is permitted by 62 Vict. ch. 35, s. 2 and a conviction cannot he now had under the statute as amended. Taschereau J. (dissenting.)\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. I concur in the views expressed by Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 in the court appealed from.\nGwynne J. (dissenting.)-This is a civil action commenced in the Superior Court of the District of Quebec at the suit of the appellants who, by the conclusions in their declaration filed on the 20th of October 1898 claim the right\nto recover from the defendant the sum of three hundred and twenty five dollars with interest and costs, including costs of exhibits, plaintiff's moreover specially reserving the right to take any further conclusions as they may be entitled to by law.\nThe premises from which this conclusion is drawn as stated in the declaration are that as is their alleged,\nthe defendant illegally and without right, he not being a licentiate of pharmacy, nor a physician duly inscribed as a member of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of this province, keeps open a shop for the retailing, dispensing and compounding of drugs and of the poisons enumerated in schedule A annexed to section 4035 of the Quebec Pharmacy Act and especially during the month of August, 1898, to wit, on the 2nd, 3rd 4th, 5th and 6th of said month and year did exercise said profession in his shop and has illegally, he not being a licentiate of pharmacy nor a physician duly inscribed as a member of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of this province sold drugs and medicinal preparations containing poisons mentioned in the above schedule A, to wit, on the 2nd of August last during the forenoon a bottle of Gray's Syrup ; and on the same day during the afternoon a bottle of Wampole's Cod Liver Oil ; subsequently on the 3rd of August, an ounce of Tincture of Gentian Compound ; subsequently on the 4th of August a bottle of Fowler's Extract of Wild Strawberry ; subse quently on the 5th of August, a bottle of Cherry Pectoral and an ounce of Bromide of Potash ; subsequently on the 6th of August at about noon an ounce of Tincture of rhubarb and an ounce of Bismuth Lozenges ; and the same day in the afternoon a bottle of Hypo-bromic Compound (Wampole's) ; this bottle of Hypo-bromic Compound (Wampole's) was supplied on presentation of a prescription written and given by Doctor Elliott, of Quebec ; forming altogether seven offences for which defendant has incurred a penalty of $25 for the first offence and of $50 for the second and each subsequent offence, forming a total of $325. To this is action the defendant pleaded a denial of the allegations in the declaration and put upon the plain tiffs the onus of proving their case as alleged. He also pleaded a plea insisting that the Act 53 Vict. ch. 46, Que., amending the Quebec Pharmacy Act upon which the action was based was ultra uires of the Provincial Legislature. The case was tried in the Superior Court of the District of Quebec before Sir L. N. Casault C.J. That court received evidence in relation to the several grounds of complaint mentioned in the declaration and having come to the conclusion. that it was not proved that the defendant filled up any prescriptions or made, compounded or prepared any drugs or medicines and, as to the articles alleged to have been sold by the defendant that \" tincture of Gentian, \u201c \u201c Bromide of Potash \u201c \u201c Tincture of Rhubarb\" and \" Bismuth Lozenges\" are not mentioned in schedule A of 53 Vict. ch. 46, and that \u201c Gray's Syrup,\" \u201c Wampole's Cod Liver Oil,\" \u201c Cherry Pectoral,\" \"Fowler's Extract of Wild Strawberry\" and \"Wam pole's Hypo-Bromic Compound\" were all proprietary medicines, all of which, except Fowler's Extract of Wild Strawberry, were proved to contain a minute portion of a poison mentioned in schedule A, but in such small proportion as to be not only innocuous but beneficial medicines, and thereupon the court, upon the ground that by force of an Act of the Legis lature of Quebec 62 Vict\u00bb ch. 35 the sale of the pro prietary medicines was not prohibited, dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs. No judgment was pronounced by the court upon the plea of ultra vires, which in so far as appears was not relied upon or argued. The judgment of the Superior Court upon appeal by the plaintiffs, was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench in Appeal, and from that judgment the present appeal is taken. Upon a motion to quash this appeal for want of jurisdiction to entertain it, a majority of this court was of opinion that, notwithstanding that the amount claimed in the conclusions of the declaration was only $325, still the plea of ultra vires being on the record an appeal at the suit of the plaintiffs to this court well lay.\nAccordingly, the case came for hearing before us, when the question as to ultra wires of the statute was not only not argued but the learned counsel for the respondent abandoned all reliance on the plea which raised that question, but such abandonment of the plea cannot divest the court of its duty to decline to interfere, if satisfied that the legislature had no juris diction in the matter. But there can be no doubt that the legislature had by sub-sec. 15 of sec. 92 of the British North America Act jurisdiction to legislate for the imposition of fines, penalties or imprisonment for enforcing any law of the province made in relation to any matter within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in sec. 92.\nThe case was argued wholly upon the grounds upon which the Superior Court proceeded, and upon the frame of the declaration itself it is apparent that no conviction can be obtained or fine be imposed under the statute declared upon for any second or subsequent offence when no conviction for the first offence has been stated in the declaration and proved and up to the present moment no conviction for a first offence against the provisions of the statute has been obtained. Whether an offence has or has not been committed which warrants a conviction and the imposition of the penalty prescribed by the statute for a first offence is the question now under consideration, and that in point of fact is the only question which is, if any be, open upon the record and with which we have to deal. The Act, relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellants in their argument before us selected as a first offence against the provisions of the statute, the sale of a bottle of \u201cGray\u2019s Syrup.\" It matters not. which of the sales enumerated in the declaration should be selected inasmuch as all the articles sold, with the exception of \u201c Tincture of Gentian,\" \u201c Bromide of Potash \u201c and \u201c Tincture of Rhubarb,'' which are not in the list of prohibitions, consisted of proprietary medicines, so that we may deal with the ease as if the sale of \" Gray's Syrup,\" the article relied upon by the appellants themselves as constituting the first offence for conviction of which this action has been instituted, was the sole complaint stated in the declaration. For the determination of the present appeal I do not think it necessary to consider whether or not in a procedure like the present, to impose a penalty for an offence committed against the provisions of the statute it is sufficient to aver merely the sale of a bottle of \" Grays Syrup\" without alleging that it contained some one or more of the prohibited poisons mentioned in the schedule A, so as to admit evidence upon that point ; hut dealing with the case apart from any such consideration, as it was dealt with in the courts below, we find by reference to article 4035 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, that it is simply a repetition in consolidation of sec. 20 of 48 Vict. c. 36 (Que.), and is as follows:\n4035. No person shall Keep open a. shop for retailing, dispensing or compounding of drugs or of the poisons enumerated in schedule A annexed to this section, or sell or attempt to sell any drug or poison mentioned in the said schedule, or any medicinal preparation containing any of the said poisons, or engage in the dispensing of pre scriptions, or use or assume the title of chemist and. druggist, or chemist or druggist, or apothecary or pharmacist, or pnarmeceutist, or dispensing or pharmaceutical chemist, or any other title bearing a similar interpretation, within this province, unless he be a physician inscribed as a member of the College of Physicians and \u00a1Surgeons of this province, or be registered in accordance with the provisions of this section as a licentiate of pharmacy.\nThen followed articles 4036, 4037, 4038 and 4039 which are simple repetitions in consolidation of secs. 21 22 23 and 24 of 48 Vict. ch. 36 the latter article being as follows :\nThe provisions of the four preceding articles shall not prevent the sale of the articles mentioned in schedule B. annexed to this section\u2014provided that patent medicines be sold without their wrappers being opened and that the other articles be sold in closed packets with the name of the substance contained in such packet labelled thereon.\nNow in the above mentioned schedule A are enume rated twelve drugs almost all of which, if not all, are well known \u201cpoisons\" which word as used in the statute is by Art. 4019, paragraph 9, which is but a repetition in consolidation of sec. 2, paragraph \u201ci,\" of 48 Vict. ch. 36, declared to mean s such drugs or chemicals as are dangerous to human life.\" Then in schedule B are enumerated twenty-six items, the first of which is \u201c all patent medicines,\" and of the twenty five not one is enumerated in and prohibited in schedule A although two of them at least c carbolic acid crude,\" and \u201c Paris green \u201c are well know powerful poisons.\nThe enactment therefore that a clause which does not prohibit the sale of any of those substances \" shall not prevent \" their sale does not seem to be a felicitous mode of expression in an act of the legislature, but it is with the item \u201c All Patent Medicines, \u201c that we have to deal, and this expression so used in this penal statute comprehended, I think \" proprietary medicines,\" that is to say, medicines which some person or persons have an exclusive right to make and sell.\nWe have it thus established by legislative authority that the sale of patent medicines which term includes proprietary medicines by a person other than a drug gist, chemist, physician or licentiate of pharmacy, was not prohibited by 48 Vict. ch. 36, and that thereafter. as before the passing of the Act, it was competent for any person to sell such medicines and this was con sonant with common sense and with the whole spirit and intent of the Act which was passed to prevent the practice of the profession or business of physicians. chemists and druggists by incompetent persons, and the preparation and sale by such persons of poisons, or medicinal preparations containing poisons injurious to human life which proprietary medicines are known to be, as those at least mentioned in the present case have been proved to be, not harmless only, but beneficial. Now, while it had been always and still was quite competent for any person to sell patent or proprietary medicines without any interference whatever an Act was passed in 1890, 53 Vict. ch. 46 intituled \u201cAn Act to amend the Quebec Pharmacy Act.\" That Act made no alteration whatever in the article 4035, save by adding to its three sub-sections which have no relevancy in the present case and by the last or seventeenth section of the Act enacting as follows :\nThe schedules A and B, after article 4052 of the said Revised Statutes, are replaced by the following schedule A, and the schedule G shall be known as schedule B.\nThis schedule C which was annexed to 48 Vict. ch. 36 was a \u201cPoison Sales Register \u201c which all persons having authority to sell poisons in the Province of Quebec were required to keep by sec. 19 of 48 Vict. ch. 36 consolidated as article 4034 in the Revised Statutes.\nWhat was meant by enacting that this s schedule 0 shall be known as schedule B,\" which is wholly obliterated and done away with does not seem very clear In the new schedule A which is substituted for the two former schedules A and B, in substitution for twelve drug's prohibited in the former schedule A, are enumerated thirty-three poisonous drugs which are the only prohibited ones, and one of these, namely, \" carbolic acid crude \u201c is the only one which had been in schedule B. As to \u201cParis green\" which was also in schedule B, special provision to be noted hereafter Tas made. Not one of the other items which had been enumerated in schedule B is referred to and so by expunging the schedule B, the incongruity already referred to as an infirmity in the former Act in enacting that a clause which does not prohibit the sale of an article shall not prevent the sale of that article, would be removed.\nThe statute then enacted that \u201cArt. 4039 of the Revised Statutes is replaced by the following : Nothing herein shall prevent the sale by persons not registered in pursuance of this law of \u2018 Paris Green or London Purple,' so long as said articles are sold in well secured packages distinctly labelled with the name of the article the name and address of the seller, and marked \" poison.' \u201c\nIt is difficult to conceive that the legislature while thus authorising the sale of a deadly poison by unlicensed persons, contemplated by the clause to bring about the prohibition of the sale of proprietary medicines by unlicensed persons. It seems much more probable that in abrogating schedule B in the manner in which it was abrogated, the difference between a patent medicine not in terms prohibited, and specific drug's as all the other articles in schedule B were (and which also were not prohibited articles) was not noticed, or that it was thought unnecessary to make any distinction between them except in the provision made as to the poison \" Paris green.\" But whether the abrogation of schedule B, under these circum stances had the effect of creating the prohibition of the sale by unlicensed persons of patent medicines which the Act declared had not been prohibited by it, we need not now inquire, for in 1899 the legislature passed the Act 62 Vict. ch. 35 upon which the learned Chief Justice Sir L. N. Casault proceeded at the trial. whereby a clause was added to Art 4039 which was designated 4039 b, whereby it was enacted as follows:\nNothing in this Act applies to or in any manner affects the preparation or sale of a patented or proprietary medicine,\nthus restoring in the letter the provision in the original Act in conformity with its spirit, and intent, and indicating sufficiently, I think, that the change, if any was effected by the manner in which schedule B was abrogated as regards patent or proprietary medicines,. was caused through inadvertence and not intentionally, and that after the passing of 62 Vict. ch. 35, no court can pronounce the sale of a proprietary medicine, although the sale may have taken place before the passing of the Act, to be an offence against the provisions of the Act punishable by fine and. imprisonment. It has been argued that as the Act was passed subsequently to the institution of the proceeding to have the sale pronounced to be an offence against the provisions of the Act the statute cannot affect the present proceeding which it is contended was an offence between the passing of 48 Vict. ch 46, and of 62 Vict. ch. 35, though it never had been an offence against the provision of any law before or since This contention rests wholly upon a further contention, namely, that when this proceeding was instituted the Pharmaceutical Association the present appellants, had a right to the sum of twenty-five dollars now demanded of which right the subsequent Act has not deprived them, but this contention is wholly based on a fallacy, for no one can have any right in a sum to be inflicted as a fine in case only of an offence against the provisions of the Act being established, until the offence is established, and fine imposed upon con viction ; and as to the appellants in particular having had any right at the time of their instituting the present proceeding, more than any other informers, that contention appears to be devoid of any foundation; the Act does not say that to enforce and recover the penalty the appellants may proceed and recover it in a civil action as a debt due to them. The 36th sec. of 48 Vict. ch. 36, which is consolidated in Art. 4051 of the Revised Statutes enacts that\nall fees, penalties and fines payable under this Act shall belong to the Pharmaceutical Association of the Province of Quebec for the purposes of this Act,\nbut for a fine or penalty to become payable under the Act a conviction for an offence against the provisions of the Act must first be obtained * and this clause gives no civil action to the appellants to recover the amount of fine as a debt. The only section regulating prose cautions for the purpose of convicting a person of an offence charged to have been committed against the provisions of the Act is sec. 25 of 48 Vict. ch. 36, which is consolidated as Art. 4040 of the Revised Statutes which enacts that\nprosecutions instituted for the recovery of any fine imposed under this Act may be instituted by the association or by any other person before the judge of the sessions, the police magistrate or recorder in the cities of Montreal and Quebec, or before a district magistrate or justice of the peace of the place where the offence was committed in the other parts of the province, or may be instituted before any competent court of the place where the offence was committed by simple civil action in the ordinary manner.\nThis last clause, as it appears to me, plainly means that the fine may be imposed and recovered by civil action in the ordinary manner in which lines and pen alties for the contravention of law may be enforced and recovered in a court having civil jurisdiction, that is to say in the manner prescribed in Art. 16 C.C. namely, by an ordinary process of law in the name of Her Majesty alone or jointly with another prosecutor before any court having civil jurisdiction to the amount sought to be recovered ; and as the amount sought to be recovered here is the amount payable for a first offence, if any such should be proved, namely, twenty five dollars, the only court of civil jurisdiction com petent to convict the appellant, if the offence should be proved, is the Circuit Court whose jurisdiction in matters under $100 is absolute, to the exclusion of the Superior Court. Upon all these grounds, therefore, the appeal, in my opinion, must be dismissed with costs.\nSedgewick J.\u2014This is a proceeding instituted by the Pharmaceutical Association of the Province of Quebec against the defendant who styles himself a merchant-photographer and wholesale drug merchant, but who carries on the business of a druggist and chemist in the City of Quebec, and the charge alleged against him is a violation in several particulars of the Quebec Pharmacy Act.\nIt would appear that the council of the association, in the interests of the profession and of the public, as well as in pursuance of their statutory duties, resolved to prosecute offenders against the Act, and employed one Cranks haw to procure the necessary evidence. In the month of August, 1898, and on five different days of that month, he visited the respondent's drug store and purchased, in two instances from himself and in the other instances from his employees, the following articles '. a bottle of Gray's Syrup, a bottle of Wam pole's Cod Liver Oil l an ounce of tincture of Gentian Compound * a bottle of Fowler's Extract of Wild Straw berry ; a bottle of Cherry Pectoral : an ounce of bromide of potash * an ounce of tincture of Rhubarb ; an ounce of Bismuth Lozenges, and a bottle of hypo bromic compound (Wampole's). These articles were for the most part submitted, for examination and analysis, to Dr. Fafard, an eminent analyst and pro fessor of chemistry in the University of Laval, who found and testified that four of them namely, Gray's Syrup, Wampole's Cod Liver Oil, Ayer's Cherry Pectoral, and Wampole's Hypo-Bromic Compound, con tained poisons, namely morphine and. strychnine. The evidence of both Crankshaw and Dr. Fafard was amply corroborated and all the courts below agreed upon the facts just stated.\nThe right of the plaintiff association to recover depends solely upon the provisions of the Quebec Pharmacy Act, and for the purposes of this opinion, I set out the following articles '.\nArt. 4035. No person shall keep open a shop for the retailing, dispensing or compounding of drugs or of the poisons enumerated in schedule A, annexed to this section, or sell or attempt to sell any drug or poison mentioned in the said schedule, or any medicinal preparation containing any of the said poisons, or engage in the dispensing of prescriptions, or use or assume the title of chemist and drug gist, or chemist or druggist, or apothecary, or pharmacist, or pharmaceutics, or dispensing or pharmaceutical chemist, or any other title bearing a similar interpretation, within this province, unless he be a physician inscribed as a member of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of this province or be registered in accordance with the provisions of this section as a licentiate of pharmacy.\nArt 4040 Prosecutions instituted for the recovery of any fine imposed under this section may be instituted by the association or by any other person, before the judge of the sessions, the police magistrate or recorder in the cities of Montreal and Quebec or before a district magistrate or justice of the peace of the place where the offence was committed, in the other parts of the province, or may be instituted before any competent court of the place where the offence was committed by simple civil action in the ordinary manner.\nArt. 4052. Nothing in this section shall interfere with the privileges conferred upon physicians and surgeons by the various Acts relating to the practice of medicine and surgery in this province, or with the business of wholesale dealers in drugs in the ordinary course of wholesale dealing, or with chemical manufacturers, or with duly licensed veterinary surgeons in their practice or business as such. It is admitted that the defendant is not a physician inscribed as a member of the College of Physicians and Surgeons nor is he a licentiate of pharmacy, and the first question is as to whether he has violated any of the provisions of art. 4035.\nThat article prohibits (among other things) the retailing or selling by unauthorised persons of several classes of articles, namely, (1) drugs ; (2) poisons enumerated in the schedule ; and (3), any medicinal preparations containing any of such poisons. According to the interpretation clause, the word drugs means articles used medicinally, whether compound or simple, and the word poisons means drugs or chemicals which are dangerous to human life. So that the statute is violated if drugs are retailed or sold, whether such drugs be poisons, or partially composed of poisons, or are absolutely free from poisons.\nIt was proved beyond controversy at the trial that the respondent sold the articles in question, and that they are drugs not only within the meaning of the Act, but according to the ordinary and popular meaning of that word, and the fundamental error, I respectfully venture to state in the judgment appealed from, is the view that in order to constitute an offence under the Act the articles sold must either be an enumerated poison, or an article containing an enumerated poison. While no doubt the main object of the legislature in enacting the statute was to protect the public from the possible incompetency of vendors of drugs or chemicals dangerous to human life it also was its object to take charge of the whole retail drug business and compel all persons engaged in it to pass a qualifying examination and obtain a license therefor. The contention very feebly put forward, that the respond cut was not a retail druggist but a wholesale dealer as well in drugs as in photographic supplies, is in my view out of the question. The purchases proved were made on five different days. The articles pure chased were probably, in every case but one, the minimum amount which one could purchase at a drug store. The articles submitted for analysis could all be carried in a small bag, and to say that these transactions were wholesale nd not retail transactions is, in my view, nothing but farcical.\nI am also of opinion that the proceedings were rightly brought in the Superior Court by virtue of art. 4040 above set out. Whether the proceedings were criminal, or penal or purely civil in their nature, makes no difference. The prosecution by whatever name it may be called was authorised to be instituted before any competent court by civil action in the ordinary manner. The Superior Court comes within that description. The proceedings were properly taken in the name of the association and any moneys recovered became the property of the association for the purposes mentioned in art. 4051.\nThe prosecutors set out in their declaration in pur suance of the practice of the Superior Court, the circum stances upon which they relied in order to justify a condemnation. They allege several offences, but they describe all these offences committed after the first as second offences. In this they were wrong, as (it was admitted) a person can only be convicted of a second offence after a conviction for a first offence so that none of the offences alleged in the declaration were second offences. They were each however, first offences, and inasmuch as in a civil proceeding several causes of action may be joined, there is no reason why in one proceeding in a civil court several penalties may not be sued for and recovered for more than one offence There is not, however, any necessity to consider this point more fully, as counsel for the association consented at the argument that if the appeal should be allowed a judgment for one offence might be entered as the object of the association was not, in the present case punitive but rather to obtain an authoritative declaration as to their rights, and as to the disabilities of persons carrying on the ordinary retail drug business in the province.\nOne point remains. After these proceedings were instituted and after the learned trial judge had taken the case en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, the Quebec Legislature amended the Pharmacy Act by adding to art. 4039a, another article which reads in part as follows:\nNothing in this Act contained shall extend to or interfere with, or affect the making or dealing in any patent or proprietary medicines.\nNow it is admitted that four and perhaps five of the articles purchased from the respondent by Crankshaw were patent or proprietary medicines, but it is equally clear that other articles purchased were not ; they were drugs however, and therefore not within the article, and a judgment for the association may be sustained in respect to those articles not within the purview of the amendment just referred to\nNevertheless, we think that this Act has no retroactive effect. Whether the amending statute would have been so considered under the old common law may be doubted, but any such consequence has been removed in the Province of Quebec by art. 7 of the Act respecting the Revised Statutes of Quebec, and by art. 11 of the Preliminary Title. In view, how ever, of the fact that we propose to give judgment for the plaintiff's for $25 only this point need not be further discussed.\nIn my view the appeal should be allowed with costs, and judgment entered in the Superior Court for $25 with costs upon the lower scale, together with the costs of the appeal.\nKING and GIROUARD JJ.\u2014concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal for the reasons stated by Sedgewick J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Drouin, Pelletier & Fiset.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Robitaille & Roy.\n[1] Q.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs against the City of Chatham, defendant, and reversing said judgment in favour of the third party, the Bell Telephone Co.\nThis action was brought by the plaintiffs against the Corporation of the City of Chatham, in Ontario, to recover damages sustained through a collision with a telephone pole while the horses of the plaintiff, Nathan H. Stevens, were running away on King Street in Chatham, the plaintiff, Mary L. Atkinson being thrown out of the sleigh drawn by the said horses, the sleigh damaged and the young lady having her leg broken.\nKing street is a long street, and at the westerly end of it there is a sharp curve of 117 degrees, and about 60 feet from the centre of this angle there is a telephone pole erected by the appellants, the Bell Telephone Company, (under its statutory powers,) in 1893, which stands on the edge of the gutter along the travelled part of the street. The plaintiffs allege that the street was so much out of repair that it caused the sleigh to partly go over on its side when the horses and sleigh arrived at the turn, the sleigh, which was a high covered carriage top set on sleigh runners, in swinging round at the curve, upset, and the top struck against the telephone pole, thereby causing the injury complained of, and that but for the pole the injury might have been avoided.\nThe action was brought against the City of Chatham alone. The city caused the Bell Telephone Company to be joined as third party, to indemnify the city if the latter was liable to the plaintiffs.\nMr. Justice Ferguson, before whom the action was tried, found a verdict for the plaintiffs against the defendants, the City of Chatham, and dismissed the city\u2019s claim for indemnity against the Bell Telephone Company, although he expressed the view that the telephone company might have been successfully sued for the damage claimed.\nFrom this judgment the City of Chatham appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the judgment as to the liability of the defendant (the city) to the plaintiffs was maintained, but the Bell Telephone Company, the third party, was ordered to indemnify the city. The city now appeals against the plaintiffs from that part of the judgment of the court which holds it liable, and opposes the Bell Telephone Company\u2019s appeal against its liability to indemnify the defendant, the city.\nThe finding of the learned judge at the trial was, that by reason of the telephone pole being so near the centre of the street the latter was out of repair, and was the cause of the accident and the defendant (the city) was liable therefor.\nThe defendant (the city), beside denying that the street was out of repair, by reason of the position of the pole, or otherwise, contends that the pole was erected and maintained in the place where it was by the Bell Telephone Co. (third party), under its statutory powers, without any authority of the defendant, and plead also contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiffs, as an answer to the action.\nMatthew Wilson Q.C. for the appellant, Bell Telephone Co., third party. The pole was placed where it was by order of the city engineer and was lawfully there under the statute. Roberts v. Wisconsin Telephone Co.[1]; Commonwealth v. City of Boston[2]; Soule v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[3]; Ricketts v. Village of Markdale[4]. Aylesworth Q.C. and Douglas Q.C. for the respondent, City of Chatham. As to liability of third party to indemnify city see Bonn v. Bell Telephone Co.[5]\nWilson Q.C. in reply to City of Chatham.\nAylesworth Q.C. and Douglas Q.C. for the City of Chatham, appellant, referred to Town of Portland v. Griffiths[6]; City of Halifax v. Lordly[7]; Foley v. Township of East Flamboro[8].\nAtkinson Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In this action a verdict was rendered in favour of the plaintiffs against the City of Chatham for damages for which the third party was ordered to indemnify the City of Chatham.\nThe judgment of the learned trial judge having been confirmed in appeal, the third party, by leave of the Court of Appeal, at Toronto, in pursuance of a statute, affecting the case, appeals against the judgment as rendered against it, whether Chatham be or be not liable to the plaintiffs, and the Corporation of the City of Chatham by like leave appeals against the judgments rendered in favour of the plaintiffs against it.\nAs between the third party and the Corporation of Chatham, we entertain no doubt that the telegraph pole to which the learned judge attributes the accident which was the cause of the action, was planted in a street in Chatham, presumably by the servants of the third party, but by the authority of the corporation. And as between the Corporation of Chatham and the plaintiffs, we likewise entertain no doubt that the said pole so planted by the corporation was lawfully planted where it was, outside of the portion of the highway appropriated by by-law for the use of horses and carriages, and so was not a nuisance of which persons lawfully using the highway could complain. But we hold it to be clearly established by the evidence that the pole was not the causa causans or any part of the cause of the accident, which was the running away of the horses with the carriage in which the injured plaintiffs were, in a violent manner, at excessive speed and wholly beyond the control of the person driving them.\nThe complaint at the trial was not that the pole caused the injury complained of, but the bad state of repair of the road, which it was contended caused the carriage to upset. The learned trial judge held, and we think rightly, against this contention, but as to the pole, instead of having caused the accident, the evidence seems to establish that it caused rather the separation of the horses from the carriage, (if it had any connection with the accident at all), and thereby prevented greater injury than might otherwise have happened.\nBut the causa causans was the violent, uncontrollable speed at which the horses were running away. Without saying that in no case can a person injured in a carriage drawn by running-away horses maintain an action for damages, we hold that in the present case the sole conclusion justified by the evidence is that the uncontrollable manner in which the horses were running away was the cause of the accident.\nWe are of opinion, therefore, that the appeal of the corporation must be allowed with costs, and that the action be dismissed with costs, but that the corporation be ordered to pay the Telephone Company their costs of this appeal and also the costs incurred in the action by reason of their having been made third party hereto.\nAppeal of defendant allowed with special direction as to costs.\nSolicitor for the third party, appellant: S.G.

The lender was informed at the time of the manner in which the loan was to be, and was, applied.\nHeld, that as the company did not exist at the time of the loan it could not be the principal debtor nor the borrower a mere guarantor. The latter was, therefore, primarily liable for repayment of the loan.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (Bugbee v. Clergue, 27 Ont. App. R. 96) affirmed. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing in part the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nFrancis H. Clergue, now of the Town of Sault Ste. Marie, in the Province of Ontario, and manager of large industrial and manufacturing establishments there, was in the year 1891 resident in Bangor, in the State of Maine. He was a member of the law firm of Laughton & Clergue, who were also actively engaged in promoting financial schemes. Amongst other companies, there were the Bangor Street Railway Company, the Water Works Company, the Bangor Electric Light and Power Company, and the Penobscot Water Works Company, the latter being in the adjoining Town of Veasey. Of all of these companies Laughton was president and Clergue a director.\nAn amalgamation or consolidation scheme had been brought about by the formation of a new company, the Public Works Company, to which the property of these several companies, amounting to about two million dollars, had been transferred. Of this company Laughton was also president and Clergue a director, one Wardell being treasurer.\nThe Public Works Company were in June, 1891, engaged in constructing large works at the hydraulic plant midway between the town of Bangor and the town of Oldtown; and on June 1st, 1891, a pay day was approaching when the funds of that company in hand were not sufficient to meet the whole pay-roll. Clergue went to Bugbee, the original plaintiff, and applied for a loan of $1,500 to the Public Works Company expressly for the pay-roll\u2014to meet the pay-roll on the coming Saturday at the works then going on. Bugbee gave his cheque for $1,500 on the Eastern Trust and Banking Company payable to Laughton & Clergue; handed this cheque to Clergue, who took it down to Wardell, the treasurer of the Public Works Company, indorsed it over and delivered it to Wardell with instructions to credit Bugbee with the $1,500 in the books of the Public Works Company, which was done. This money was used by the Public Works Company to meet the pay-roll.\nA few days afterwards, Bugbee came to the office of Laughton & Clergue and asked for a guarantee from Laughton & Clergue for the repayment of the loan, and it was then arranged that the note of Laughton & Clergue should be given for this purpose; it was also arranged that $5,000 stock in the Bangor Street Railway Company belonging either to the Public Works Company or one of the consolidating companies, should be given as collateral security to Bugbee. The stock was accordingly delivered to Bugbee and the note given. The note became due and Bugbee refused to renew it; and Clergue heard no more about it till two or three years after, in 1894.\nClergue came to Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, in the fall of 1894, and has resided there ever since.\nWaiting till Clergue had been out of the country for a year, Bugbee on the 15th August, 1895, issued a writ out of the Supreme Judicial Court of the State of Maine, against both Laughton and Clergue. Laughton admits service of this and of notice of trial, apparently assisting Bugbee. He subsequently \u201cdefaulted,\u201d not appearing or answering, and judgment was noted against him in January, 1896.\nThis writ was not served upon Clergue and no notice of it was ever given or came to him.\nIn 1897 Bugbee issued a writ against Clergue in the High Court of Justice for Ontario indorsed with a claim on the judgment recovered in Maine. The statement of claim in said action contained a count claiming also on the original debt, namely, the promissory note given by Laughton & Clergue when the loan was effected.\nAt the trial the plaintiff, Bugbee, recovered on both the note and the judgment. The Court of Appeal affirmed this judgment as to recovery on the note but reversed it as to the judgment.\nRiddell Q.C. for the appellant. By the writ the action is on the judgment only and the statement of claim cannot give plaintiff another and separate action. Ker v. Williams[2]; United Telephone Co. v. Tasker[3]; Lancaster v. Moss[4]. Moreover, the note is merged in the judgment.\nIf the note can be sued upon, it can only be as of the date of issue of the statement of claim and it is barred by pre-emption. Dumble v. Larush[5]; Chard v. Rae[6].\nWyld and Osler for the respondent, referred to Large v. Large[7]; Smythe v. Martin[8]; Bullock v. Caird[9].\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE. J.\u2014This appeal, we think, must be dismissed with costs.\nBefore the Judicature Act, a declaration in an action on a foreign judgment might contain counts upon the original consideration upon which the judgment was obtained, and the plaintiff failing to prove the judgment, might recover on the original consideration. We do not think the Judicature Act which requires the cause of action to be briefly stated on the writ of summons, and the fact, that on the writ of summons, in this case, was indorsed a statement that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was on a judgment recovered in the Supreme Court of the State of Maine, for a sum stated, have the effect of preventing the plaintiff inserting in his statement of claim a count as formerly upon the original consideration.\nTo the statement of claim, which declared upon the judgment and also a note which was the original consideration, the defendant pleaded to both claims. As to the note he pleaded the statute of limitations and as to that plea must fail, unless he should succeed in establishing, as he contends, that the date of the commencement of the action, as regards the claim upon the note, must be the day of filing the statement of claim and not the day of issue of the writ of summons.\nWe do not think that this contention can prevail, the sole effect of which could be to bar a claim which appears to be quite just. But, apart from consideration of the effect of such contention prevailing, we do not think it well founded.\nThen, as to the merits of the claim on the note, we are not troubled with considering the point so much urged at the trial and before us as to what the law is in the State of Maine as to the liability of guarantors of the debt of another, or as to what is the difference between the liability of guarantors and of sureties, for we have no difficulty in holding, upon the evidence, that the makers of the note sued upon, namely the defendant and his law partner, were the sole principals in the transaction.\nThe contention of the defendant was that the advance was made to a company whose guarantor only the defendant was, and that by the law of Maine a guarantor cannot be sued until his principal is put in default, but he himself admitted that it was he who applied for the loan for which the note was given\u2014that his partner was president and he himself a director of several companies, the consolidation of all which into one he was then engaged in promoting. It was, as the lender (of whose will the present plaintiffs are executors) in his lifetime testified, to assist the defendant in promoting the consolidatien in which he was engaged that the advance was made to him, and it was to secure payment of this loan that the note sued upon was made. Now, whether the consolidation so in promotion did take place and if so when, matters not, for when the loan was made at the defendant\u2019s request, the consolidated company was not in existence, and so could not have become the principal debtor, but whether it was to the consolidated company or to one of the several companies the consolidation of which the defendant was engaged in promoting that the defendant now contends the advance was made the evidence fails to show that the testator (whose executors the plaintiffs are) who advanced the money into the hands of the defendant and received the note as his sole security ever dealt with any company or with any other persons than the makers of the note, as principals in the transaction. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.C.

On appeal by the city to the Divisional Court the damages were reduced to $60, but the judgment at the trial for $265 was restored on further appeal by the plaintiff to the Court of Appeal. The city then appealed to the Supreme Court. Latchford Q.C. moved on behalf of the respondent, after notice, to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, claiming that only $265 was in dispute and citing Bain v. Anderson[1]; Jermyn v. Tew[2], as authorities for the position that the sum demanded in the action does not govern the amount in dispute.\nMcVeity, contra. The Act 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 34 (f) is in precisely the same terms as R.S.C. ch. 135, sec. 29, sub-sec. 4 relating to Quebec appeals, and the latter sub-section has always been acted upon. Laberge v. Equitable Life Insurance Society.[3]\nIf the two sub-sections of sec. 1 are repugnant sub-sec, (f) should be the one upheld as it is placed later in the section than (c).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The respondent\u2019s action was for $1,325. Judgment was given at the trial in his favour for $261. He was satisfied with that amount and no motion was made on his behalf against the said judgment.\nThe appellant however appealed from it, claiming that the amount of $261 was too large, and such appeal was heard before the Queen\u2019s Bench Division where judgment was given reducing the amount of the respondent\u2019s verdict to the sum of $60.\nThe respondent thereupon appealed from the last mentioned judgment to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, seeking to have the judgment of the trial judge restored, and that the amount of the judgment as awarded by the trial judge, namely, $261, should be maintained.\nUpon that appeal the respondent did not ask that the amount of the judgment, as pronounced by the trial judge, should be increased, but was content that the judgment should remain at that amount.\nThe appeal was duly heard before the Court of Appeal and the judgment of that court was pronounced on the 29th of June, 1900, allowing the said appeal of the respondent and ordering that the judgment of the trial judge for the sum of $261 should be restored.\nThe present appeal has now been brought by the appellant to this court against the judgment of the Court of Appeal, awarding the respondent the said sum of $261, the amount of the original verdict in his favour at the trial.\nThe respondent moved to quash on the ground that under 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 34, sec. 1 (c) (D), this court has now no jurisdiction in Ontario cases wherein the amount in controversy does not exceed one thousand dollars. The appellant in answer to that motion, rests his right to appeal on paragraph (f) of the same section of the Act, the original demand being for over one thousand dollars.\nThe same point has been determined as to Quebec appeals in Laberge v. Equitable Life Assurance Society[4]. We there held that it is the amount originally claimed, not the amount claimed by the appeal, or in controversy before this court, that must govern in cases where our jurisdiction depends upon the pecuniary amount; and the appellant here contends that the construction we gave to the statute in that case should be now given to the Ontario appeals under 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 34.\nThat convention however cannot prevail, for the simple reason that the enactments relating to Quebec appeals are different from those relating to Ontario appeals. It is true that paragraph (f) relating to Ontario appeals is in the same words as paragraph 4, of sec. 29 of the Supreme Court Act, relating to Quebec appeals, under which Laberge v. The Equitable Life Assurance Society4 was determined. But then in paragraph 1 of the section relating to Quebec appeals, it is where the amount in controversy does not amount to two thousand dollars that the case is not appealable, whilst for the Ontario appeals, the words \u201cin the appeal\u201d have been added after the words \u201cthe amount in controversy,\u201d making it read that it is only when the amount in controversy in the appeal exceeds the sum of one thousand dollars that the case is appealable.\nNow when we see in statutes in pari materi\u00e2, by the very same legislature, additional words of that nature to a prior enactment, we would be setting at naught the very clear intention of the legislature if we gave to the last enactment the same construction that had been judicially given to the prior one, as the appellant asks us to do. We cannot so read out of a statute expressions that must be held to have deliberately been inserted so as to make the new statute different from the prior one.\nIt is upon the appeal before this court, in Ontario appeals, that the matter in controversy must exceed one thousand dollars. Vide Bain v. Anderson & Co.[5]; Jermyn v. Tew[6]. Parliament has clearly intended, for Ontario appeals, not to re-enact the anomaly that exists in Quebec cases of allowing appeals where the only amount in controversy before this court may be of $100, $50, $20, or even a less amount.\nBy construing paragraph (f) as if the words \u201cby the appeal\u201d were inserted after the word \u201cdemanded,\u201d there is no repugnancy between it and the prior paragraph (c). By that construction, the two enactments are reconciled. And that we have to do, if at all possible.\nThe rule that a prior enactment is superseded by a later one incompatible with it cannot be applied here. These two paragraphs became law at one and the same moment. They no doubt cannot but be read one after the other, but Parliament\u2019s will as to both was expressed by simultaneous enactments; and these enactments cannot together be construed as meaning that it is and that it is not the amount in controversy in the appeal before this court that will govern the right of appeal, or as saying at the same breath, yes and no.\nIt would be so irrational for a legislative body to enact a law, and at the very same time to repeal it, that it cannot be contended that paragraph (f) of the Act in question repealed the words \u201cin the appeal\u2019\u2019 that are to be found in paragraph (c). No statute ever concluded by a repeal clause or an amending clause of its own enactments, and no construction involving impliedly such a repeal or amendment can be admitted.\nMotion allowed with costs.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Taylor McVeity.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Latchford, McDougall & Daly.\n[1] 28 Can.

[1887] ch. 167.)\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial[2] in favour of the defendant company.\nThe question for decision of the appeal is stated in the above head-note and in the judgment of the court.\nLash Q.C. for the appellants. The court must decide, from all the circumstances whether or not the condition is just and reasonable. See Smith v. City of London Ins. Co.[3]; May v. Standard Ins. Co.[4]\nThe condition is eminently unreasonable. McKay v. Norwich Union Ins. Co.[5]; Graham v. Ontario Mutual Ins. Co.[6]\nCreelman Q.C. and Maclnnes for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by: GWYNNE J.\u2014The respondent, being a fire insurance company, doing business in the Province of Ontario, has two forms of printed policies in use, both framed in the form prescribed by the Ontario Insurance Act, (ch. 167, R.S.O. 1887) the one being for insurance with the clause known as the \u201cco-insurance\u201d clause and the other not having such clause. The premium charged in the case of insurance effected on a policy having the clause is twenty per cent less than that charged on insurance in the other form. Parties insuring may select in which form a policy shall be entered into with them. Now in section 114 of the above Act, it is enacted that:\nThe conditions set forth in this section shall as against the insurers be deemed to be part of every contract whether sealed, written or oral of fire insurance hereafter entered into or renewed or otherwise in force in Ontario with respect to any property therein or in transit therefrom or thereto and shall be printed on every such policy with the heading statutory conditions; and no stipulation to the contrary or providing for any variation, addition or omission shall be binding on the assured unless evidenced in the manner prescribed by sections 115 and 116.\nUpon the second of January, 1896, the respondent entered into a policy with the plaintiffs which contained the co-insurance clause under the heading of \u201cvariations in conditions\u201d as prescribed by the Act and in every particular in the precise manner prescribed by the sections 115 and 116.\nUpon this clause being so introduced into the policy it became part of the contract of insurance contained in the policy to the same extent precisely as the statutory conditions indorsed on the policy would have been if no alteration had been made therein.\nIt is quite unimportant whether the alteration so introduced into the contract was of the character of a variation in any particular statutory condition or an addition to the statutory conditions, and the clause, having been introduced into the contract of insurance in the precise manner prescribed by the Act, became part of the contract, unless it should be pronounced to be unjust and unreasonable by the court or judge before whom a question should be tried relating thereto.\nThe clause then being so introduced into the policy, if it should be pronounced to be unjust and unreasonable, the effect would be that either the policy contained no contract or, as the appellants contend, one subject to the statutory conditions only, and so the plaintiffs, the now appellants, could recover a sum largely in excess of the amount upon which they had paid a premium upon a policy which they had held for sixteen months without objection.\nThe clause objected to has been in use in fire insurance companies in several countries on the continent of Europe, in England and in the United States for upwards of fifty years and is daily coming more into use and we can see no substantial reason or suggestion why it should be pronounced to be unjust or unreasonable.\nThere is no foundation for the contention that every variation from a statutory condition or addition thereto should be, prim\u00e2 facie, held to be unjust and unreasonable.\nIn fine, with the reasoning of the learned Chief Justice Meredith, who tried the case, we entirely concur.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Blake, Lash & Cassells.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin & Creelman.\n[1] 27 Ont.

S. C. c. 61, s. 8\u201455 & 56 V. c. 24, s. 1.\nUnder the provisions of the eighth section of \"The Patent Act\" as amended by 55 & 56 Vict. ch. 24, sec. 1 (D.), it is only in the case of the applicant exercising the option of obtaining a foreign patent before the issue of a Canadian patent for his invention that the Canadian patent shall expire by reason of the expiration of a foreign patent in existence at the time the Canadian patent is granted.\nWhere several applications are made in different countries upon the same day, the applicant cannot be said to have exercised an election to obtain any one patent before obtaining another.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] upon a second trial, dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe action is for infringement of letters patent of invention and at the first trial judgment was rendered, on the 14th June, 1899, in favour of the plaintiff[2]. An order for a new trial was made and leave granted to amend the statement of defence by adding an allegation that prior to action the patent had expired by reason of the expiration of two foreign patents for the same invention Upon the second trial the judgment now appealed from was rendered dismissing the action.\nThe questions at issue upon the present appeal are set forth in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice King, now reported.\nRiddell Q.

Subsequently an order for a new trial was made, and on May 7th, 1900, judgment was given dismissing plaintiff's action upon the ground that the patent had expired at the date of the alleged infringement.\nThe Canadian patent (no. 40,700) was applied for on March 1st, 1892, and was granted October 15th, 1892.\nOn the same day on which the Canadian patent was applied for, viz., March 1st, 1892, applications were made for an Italian and also for a British patent. The Italian patent, or as it is termed in Italy, certificate of industrial privilege, was granted March 19th, 1892, and was for the period of six years with option to renew upon payment of fees. The British patent was granted on July 12th, 1892, and was for the term of fourteen years.\nIt was held that the Canadian patent had expired at and before the time of the alleged infringement, by reason of the fact that the foreign patents, or one of them, existing at the time of the granting of the Canadian patent had expired, in the case of the Italian patent by lapse of time, and in the case of the English patent for non-payment of fees. The provision of the Canadian Act is that\nif a foreign patent exists, the Canadian patent shall expire at the earliest date at which any foreign patent for the same invention expires.\nThe Canadian Act in force at the time of the application for the patent was the Revised Statutes of Canada, ch. 61, sec. 8 of which is as follows:\n8. No inventor shall be entitled to a patent for his invention if a patent therefor in any other country lias been in existence in such country for more than twelve months prior to the application for such patent in Canada; and if during such twelve months, any person has commenced to manufacture in Canada the invention for which such patent is afterwards obtained, such person shall continue to have the right to manufacture and sell such article notwithstanding such patent; and under any circumstances, if a foreign patent exists, the Canadian patent shall expire at the earliest date at which any foreign patent for the same invention expires.\nAfter the application for the Canadian patent, but before it was granted, viz. on 9th July, 1892, section eight of chapter 61 of the Revised Statutes of Canada was repealed[4] and the following substituted therefor: 8. Any inventor who elects to obtain a patent for his invention in a foreign country before obtaining a patent for the same invention in Canada, may obtain a patent in Canada if the same be applied for within one year from the date of the issue of the first foreign patent for such invention; and if within three months after the date of the issue of a foreign patent, the inventor gives notice to the commissioner of his intention to apply for a patent in Canada for such invention, then no other person having commenced to manufacture the same device in Canada during such period of one year shall be entitled to continue the manufacture of the same after the inventor has obtained a patent therefor in Canada without the consent and allowance of the inventor; and, under any circumstances, if a foreign patent exists, the Canadian patent shall expire at the earliest date on which any foreign patent for the same invention expires.\nIt has already been held in Dreschel v. The Auer Incandescent Light Manufacturing Co.[5] that the words \"if a foreign patent exists,\" and the words \"any foreign patent\" in the last clause of these two sections, (which as to this is alike in both) relate only to such foreign patents as exist at the time of the grant of the Canadian patent.\nIn that case, the foreign patent, whose expiry was alleged to work the expiration of the Canadian patent, was granted after the granting of the Canadian patent, and hence it was sufficient for that case to make the distinction there made between foreign patents obtained before the Canadian grant and those obtained subsequent to it.\nIt is contended for the appellant that the class of foreign patents dealt with by the earlier part of the section is the class of foreign patents obtained prior to the application for the Canadian patent, and that therefore it is not unreasonable, according to the principle of construction adopted in The Auer Light Co. v. Dreschel (1) to treat the concluding clause as having reference to that class of foreign patents. It may however be urged in reply that the section is dealing with foreign patents existing at the time of the Canadian grant and that the reference to the time of application is only for the fixing of a period in a way to admit of the doing of a necessary act in obtaining the Canadian grant; but whatever ambiguity might exist on the words of the clause in the Revised Statutes, it seems that it is removed, (without effecting substantial alteration upon this point,) by the words of the Act of 1892 passed before the issue of the grant in question.\nThe Act of 1892 lays stress upon the election of the inventor to obtain the foreign grant before the Canadian one. The enactment presents the case of an inventor who may seek, either a Canadian patent alone, or a foreign patent in one country or in several countries, as well; and it assumes that he elects to obtain a foreign patent before obtaining a Canadian patent, and it further assumes that he may have elected to obtain several foreign patents before obtaining a Canadian patent. Now the enactment is that this does not prevent him seeking the Canadian patent as well, if he applies for it within a year from date of the earliest of the foreign patents that he may have obtained. As has been said, stress is laid upon the election of the inventor to obtain a foreign patent, or foreign patents, in priority to the Canadian, and upon his succeeding in his attempt. Now where (as here) several applications are made on the same day, the inventor cannot know which (if any) will be first obtained; and so he cannot be said to have exercised an election to obtain any one before obtaining another. It is wholly a matter of administration in the several offices whether any patent shall issue at all, or when it shall issue in any given case. Hence, if the concluding part of the section is to be construed by reference to its earlier part, the proper distinction is not one drawn between foreign patents granted before the granting of the Canadian patent and those granted afterwards during the currency of the latter, but is between foreign patents elected to be obtained (and actually obtained) before obtaining the Canadian patent, and foreign patents not so elected to be obtained and, consequently, between foreign patents elected to be obtained (and obtained) prior to the application for the Canadian patent and foreign patents afterwards obtained\nAs a matter of course the foreign patent must continue to exist down to the time of the grant of the Canadian patent, for it is manifestly only with regard to such that there could be any question.\nIf the enactment were clear beyond question, the consequences would be immaterial, but being open to construction in more than one sense, it seems proper to add that upon any other construction than that adopted, the inventor's rights would appear to be varied according to the greater or less degree of promptness amongst the officials of the respective patent offices.\nThe ground, therefore, upon which the learned judge vacated his original judgment fails and such judgment is to be maintained.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I dissent from the judgment in this case.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Rowan & Ross.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Macmaster, Maclennan & Hickson.\n[1] 6 Ex.

At the trial a verdict of guilty was entered and a case was reserved for the opinion of the Court of Appeal on the question whether or not the indictment would lie against a corporation. The reserved case is set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick speaking for the majority of the court. Aylesworth Q.C. for the appellant.\nChristopher Robinson Q.C. for the respondent.\nTASCHEREAU J. took no part in the judgment.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, upon a reserved case stated by Mr. Justice Walkem for the consideration of the court, the defendants having been convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of $5,000. Upon the appeal the court was equally divided. The following is the reserved case :\nThe defendants were tried and convicted at the fall assizes, at Victoria, before the Honourable Mr. Justice Walkem and a jury, under the following indictment :\nCANADA : PROVINCE OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, COUNTY OF NANAIMO, CITY OF NANAIMO.\nThe jurors for our Lady the Queen present that the \"Union Colliery Company of British Columbia, Limited Liability,\" is a company duly incorporated under the \"Companies Act, 1878,\" for the purpose, amongst other things, of acquiring coal lands in the Province of British Columbia, of extracting the coal therefrom, and of erecting and using tramways and roadways necessary for transporting said coal from the mines to the place of shipment.\nThe jurors aforesaid do further present that the said company, pursuant to the said powers, have for a long time past been mining coal near Union, in the County of Nanaimo, in the Province of British Columbia, and have been transporting said coal from said mines to Union Wharf, in said county, the place of shipment thereof, along a tramway or railway, in cars drawn by locomotives.\nThe jurors aforesaid do further present that the said tramway or railway is about ten miles in length, and that for some time past the company has been carrying passengers as well as hauling coal on said tramway or railway, between said points.\nThe jurors aforesaid do further present that the said tramway or railway, on the day and year hereinafter mentioned, was carried across the valley of the Trent River by trestle-work and a Howe truss bridge erected several years prior to said date, which truss bridge was about one hundred and thirty-three feet in length, and about ninety-five feet above the bed of the said river, and that the said trestle-work and truss bridge were maintained by the said company.\nThe jurors aforesaid do further present that in the absence of reasonable precaution and care the said Howe truss bridge might endanger human life, and that the said company were under a legal duty to take reasonable precautions against and to use reasonable care to avoid such danger.\nThe jurors aforesaid do further present that the said company unlawfully neglected, without lawful excuse, to take reasonable precautions and to use reasonable care in maintaining the said Howe truss bridge, and that on the seventeenth day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight, a locomotive engine and several cars, then being run along said tramway or railway and across said Howe truss bridge by said company, broke down said Howe truss bridge, owing to the rotten state of the timbers thereof, and were precipitated into the valley of the Trent River, thereby causing the death of Alfred Walker, Richard Nightingale, Walter Work, Alexander Mellodo, K. Nanko (Japanese), and Osana (Japanese), who were then on said cars and locomotive, against the form of the statute in such case made and provided, and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, Her Crown and dignity.\nThe question reserved for the opinion of the court is :\u2014Will the indictment lie against a corporation? If this question be answered in the negative, the conviction is to be quashed ; otherwise, the conviction is to stand.\nA verdict of guilty having been found against the defendants upon the indictment above set out, we must assume that all the facts therein stated are correct. And they are substantially as follows: The company in pursuance of its corporate powers had for a long time past been operating a railway for the purpose of transporting coal from their mines to a place of shipment by means of locomotives, and whether in pursuance of their corporate powers or not, they, as a matter of fact, were engaged in the carrying of passengers, holding themselves out as common carriers by railway. The road crossed the Trent River by means of a bridge 130 feet in length and 90 feet above the river bed. The company neglecting to use reasonable care in maintaining the bridge so that it became unsafe, ran a train carrying passengers across it, which train broke through owing to the rotten state of its timbers, causing the death of six persons then being on the train. And the sole question for our consideration is whether these facts constitute a criminal offence, whether by statute or at common law.\nIt was at one time thought that a private corporation could not commit torts or be held liable for the wrongful acts of its officers or agents, but this view has long since been exploded. A similar notion obtained in early times as to the criminal liability of a corporation, but it has long since been settled that they are liable to indictment for non-feasance, or for negligence in the performance of a legal duty. It was not until 1846 that their liability for misfeasance or active negligence was determined to be subject to like proceeding. In the case of The Queen v. The Great North of England Railway Co.[2], in 1846, Lord Denman C.J. in delivering the judgment of the court, said, at p. 325 :\nThe question is, whether an indictment will lie at common law against a corporation for a misfeasance, it being admitted, in conformity with undisputed decisions, that an indictment may be maintained against a corporation for non-feasance. * * * * But the argument is, that for the wrongful act a corporation is not amenable to an indictment, though for a wrongful omission it undoubtedly is ; assuming in the first place, that there is a plain and obvious distinction between the two species of offence.\nNo assumption can be more unfounded. Many occurrences may be easily conceived, full of annoyance and danger to the public, and involving blame in some individual or some corporation, of which the most acute person could not clearly define the cause, or ascribe them with more correctness to more negligence in providing safeguards or to an act rendered improper by nothing but the want of safeguards. If A. is authorised to make a bridge with parapets, but makes it without them, does the offence consist in the construction of the unsecured bridge, or in the neglect to secure it ? But if the distinction were always easily discoverable, why should a corporation be liable for the one species of offence and not for the other? The startling incongruity of allowing the exemption is one strong argument against it. The law is often entangled in technical embarrassments ; but there is none here. It is as easy to charge one person, or a body corporate, with erecting a bar across a public road as with non-repair of it ; and they may as well be compelled to pay a fine for the act as for the omission.\nThis case has been followed on many occasions, and cited with approval in the House of Lords. In the case of Whitfield v. South Eastern Railway Co.[3], Lord Campbell held that a railway company might be sued for a malicious libel, and in the course of his judgment says :\nThe ground on which it is contended that an action for a libel cannot possibly be maintained against a corporation aggregate fails. But, considering that an action of tort or of trespass will lie against a corporation aggregate, and that an indictment may be preferred against a corporation aggregate both for commission and omission, to be followed up by fine, although not by imprisonment, there may be great difficulty in saying that under certain circumstances express malice may not be imputed to and proved against a corporation. The authorities are connected and commented upon in Regina v. Great North of England Railway Company[4], in which it was held that a corporation aggregate may be indicted for cutting through and obstructing a public highway.\nAnd in the Pharmaceutical Society v. London & Provincial Supply Association[5], Lord Blackburn says, at p. 869:\nI quite agree that a corporation cannot in one sense commit a crime \u2014a corporation cannot be imprisoned, if imprisonment be the sentence for the crime ; a corporation cannot be hanged or put to death if that be the punishment for the crime ; and so, in those senses a corporation cannot commit a crime. But a corporation may be fined, and a corporation may pay damages; and therefore I must totally dissent, notwithstanding what Lord Justice Bramwell said, or is reported to have said, upon the supposition that a body corporate, or a corporation that incorporated itself for the purpose of pub- lishing a newspaper could not be tried and fined, or an action for damages be brought against it for libel; or that a corporation which commits a nuisance could not be convicted of the nuisance or the like. I must really say that I do not feel the slightest doubt upon that part of the case.\nFrom these authorities it is manifest that a corporation can render itself amenable to the criminal law for acts resulting in damage to numbers of people, or which are invasions of the rights or privileges of the public at large, or detrimental to the general well being or interests of the state. It appears to me perfectly clear that the offence set out in the declaration comes within this description. A public franchise was granted to the defendants to maintain and operate a railway between two certain points. They were possibly under no obligation to accept the charter, but having once accepted and acted upon it, they were under an obligation to exercise proper care and diligence in the performance of their corporate powers. Holding themselves out, as we are bound to assume they did, as public carriers, they were bound to carry their passengers safely. Even as carriers not of passengers, but of freight, carrying on their business by means of trains and locomotive engines, they were, in my view, equally bound to see to the safety and protection of their employees. Whether the persons alleged in the indictment to have been killed were employees or passengers does not appear, but whether passengers or employees, the company defendants were under an equal obligation to both, and the offence committed was an offence not so much against individual right or against people in their private capacities, but against the public at large, and therefore, in the public interest, indictable.\nThe learned Chief Justice has stated that the question to be determined is whether or not the company is liable to punishment under any section of the Code. Or, (I add) at common law. It has never been contended that the Criminal Code of Canada contains the whole of the criminal common law of England in force in Canada. Parliament never intended to repeal the common law, except in so far as the Code either expressly or by implication repeals it. So that if the facts stated in the indictment constitute an indictable offence at common law, and that offence is not dealt with in the Code, then unquestionably an indictment will lie at common law ; even if the offence has been dealt with in the Code, but merely by way of statement of what is law, then both are in force. As stated by a text writer\nwe can always separate the offence from the punishment. So that for example a statute which provides a new punishment for an old offence, repeals by implication only so much of the prior law as concerns the punishment, leaving it permissible to indict an offender either under the old law, whether statutory or common, and inflict upon him, upon conviction, the punishment ordained by the new, or under the new statute at the election of the prosecuting power. The offence and punishment, therefore, may be defined by different laws ; and so. as we have seen, if a statute simply creates an offence, the common law punishment may by implication be imposed. Bishop on Statutory Crimes, 2 ed. p. 166.\nBut the ground of offence set out in the declaration has, it is clear, been dealt with by the Code, and the indictment is evidently framed, the prosecuting officer having them before him, under the provisions of section 213, which is as follows:\nEvery one who has in his charge or under his control anything whatever, whether animate or inanimate, or who erects, makes or maintains anything whatever which, in the absence of precaution or care, may endanger human life, is under a legal duty to avoid such danger, and is criminally responsible for the consequences of omitting, without lawful excuse, to perform such duty.\nThis article I take to be a mere statutory statement of the common law, neither abridging nor enlarging it in any respect. It is true this section has no penal provision attached to it; it does not state what the consequences shall be if the offence therein specified has been committed ; but it clearly covers the offence specified here. The defendants have in their charge and under their control, and they maintain, a railway the running and operation of which without precaution or care must necessarily involve danger to human life. They were therefore under a legal duty to take precautions against such danger. They disregarded this duty. The anticipated event occurred and they are criminally responsible for it. It is not, I think, necessary to search through other provisions of the Code to find a penalty. The common law, in the case of a corporation, prescribed it\u2014a fine. And the indictment is properly framed and the verdict found, and the fine imposed, both under it and the common law together.\nIt was, however, contended, that \"every one\" at the beginning of the section, does not include a corporation. I think it does. Section 3 (t) states:\nThe expressions \"person,\" \"owner,\" and other expressions of the same kind include Her Majesty and all public bodies, bodies corporate, societies, companies, and inhabitants of counties, parishes, municipalities or other districts, in relation to such acts and things as they are capable of doing and owning respectively.\n\"Everyone\"' is an expression of the same kind as \"person,\" and therefore includes bodies corporate unless the context requires otherwise. There is no doubt that the expression \"every one\" is, whether in a legal or popular sense, a wider term than the word \"person,\" and in the case of Pharmaceutical Society v. London and Provincial Supply Association[6], already referred to, the Lord Chancellor (Lord Selborne), says:\nThere can be no question that the word \"person\" may, and I should be disposed myself to say prim\u00e2 facie does, in a public statute, include a person in law ; that is, a corporation, as well as a natural person. * * * *\nThat if a statute provides that no person shall do a particular act except on a particular condition, it is prim\u00e2 facie, natural and reasonable (unless there be something in the context, or in the manifest object of the statute, or in the nature of the subject matter, to exclude that construction) to understand the legislature as intending such persons, as, by the use of proper means, may be able to fulfil the condition ; and not those who, though called \"persons\" in law, have no capacity to do so at any time, by any means, or under any circumstances, whatsoever.\nApplying this rule to the present case, inasmuch as criminal offences committed by corporations are for the most part offences confined to the class in question in the present case, namely, cases arising from dereliction in the performance of public duty, at all events, offences as possible and likely to be committed by artificial as by natural persons, there can be no reason, that I can see, why a corporation should not be included in the phrase \"every one.\" The article is a statement of general principle of criminal law, applicable to the whole world, and binding as much upon corporations as upon individuals.\nSeveral sections of the Code were cited to us at the argument, as including within their purview the offence described in the indictment. If I am correct in the view I have taken of section 213 above cited, the offence described in the indictment comes within arts. 191 and 192, where the offence of a common nuisance is described and its punishment provided for, the first section being a mere statement of the common law in regard to criminal nuisance. Whether it does not also come within sections 251 and 252 may be open to argument, although I am strongly inclined to the view that where the Code specifies an offence and provides for the punishment by imprisonment only, it does not necessarily follow that a corporation may not be indicted and fined for the offence so described. It is not, however, necessary to determine that point here.\nIt is further argued that as the indictment disclosed a case of manslaughter, and as (as is stated) an indictment will not lie against a corporation for manslaughter, the conviction was not maintainable. It is possible that the facts alleged in the indictment would be sufficient to sustain an indictment for manslaughter against an individual, but the offence alleged in the indictment here is not the manslaughter ; it is criminal negligence in the discharge of duty. The killing is not alleged as the offence, but merely the consequence of the offence. In an indictment for manslaughter it is at least necessary to charge manslaughter as the crime\u2014to allege that the defendants \"unlawfully did kill and slay, &c.\" or \"did commit manslaughter,\" allegations wholly absent in the present case. It is not, therefore, necessary here to express any opinion as to whether or not under the present state of the law and its constantly broadening and widening jurisprudence on the subject of the civil and criminal liability of bodies corporate, they are capable of committing the offence.\nKING J. (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that the question stated in the reserved case should be answered in the negative, with the result that the appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Davie, Pooley & Luxton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H.

C.. acquiring sufficient money to enable him to retire from business about five years before his death, which occurred on the 7th November, 1896. On the 6th January, 1892, he, together with one Benjamin Douglas, borrowed $45,000 from the plaintiff company with interest at 7 p. c. payable half yearly, the principal to be paid by instalments of $2,000 each on the 1st of January in the years 1893, 1894, 1895, 1896, and the balance on the 1st January, 1897. On the 29th September, 1892, he, Elliott, borrowed the further sum of $12,000 from the plaintiffs, a mortgage being taken therefor on a portion of a certain island called Annacis Island on the Fraser River, and containing about 905 acres. Interest at 8 p. c. was payable half yearly, and the principal was to be repaid in instalments of $500 each on the 1st days of July in the years 1893, 1894, 1895 and 1896, and the balance, $10,000, on the 29th September, 1897. At the time of the execution of these mortgages Elliott was a man of good standing and repute financially, and was the owner not only of the property mortgaged but of several other valuable lands, and at the end of the year 1892 had at his credit in cash in the Banks of Montreal and British Columbia at New Westminster, the sum of $11,788.53. The evidence leads to the conclusion that in the year 1892 there was an undue inflation in the value of real estate in British Columbia, and it was conclusively established that from 1892 to 1896 there was an enormous and steadily increasing depreciation. In the years 1892 and 1893 the deceased, Elliott, duly paid the interest and taxes upon the mortgaged property, the taxes amounting to several thousands of dollars having since been paid by the plaintiffs as mortgagees. In the year 1894 Elliott withdrew from his accounts in the banks large sums of money, placing the same to the credit of his wife in the same banks, the result being that while at the time of his death he had but a very small sum to his credit in the bank, his wife had $7,330.60. This was not, however, the full extent of his generosity. Between the 10th February and the 10th December, 1894, he conveyed the whole of his real estate (except perhaps his equity of redemption in the mortgaged lands), amounting in value to $27,500 to his wife and daughter, without valuable consideration, thereby practically denuding himself of all his real property, so that at the time of his death in November, 1896, all that came into the hands of his administrator was the sum of $71.82, and the liabilities, including the two mortgages to the plaintiffs, being between $50,000 and $60,000. This suit is brought to have the voluntary conveyances made by Elliott to his wife and daughter declared void under the statute 13 Elizabeth c. 5. The plaintiffs recovered judgment against the administrator on the 17th August, 1897, for $13,467.20 and costs $21.73, and an administration order was duly made by which it was declared that the estate was insolvent.\nUpon the trial of the case before the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia, the action was dismissed as against the defendant, Ellen Elliott, widow of the deceased, but the plaintiffs recovered judgment against the daughter, which judgment affects but a very small portion of the land covered by the impeached conveyances. From this judgment an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of British Columbia, two of the learned judges dismissing the appeal upon a technical ground to which I will refer hereafter, and the dissenting judge being of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed. I entirely agree with him upon the merits of the case.\nIt may willingly be admitted that the deceased at the time he executed the mortgages in question was in a perfectly solvent condition. There is no doubt of that, nor is there any doubt but that he was in a per- fectly solvent condition before he made the conveyances and gifts of money to his wife and daughter in 1894. But it is equally clear, and the learned trial judge admits, that the effect of these gifts and transfers, assuming that they were regular and legal, was to create the deceased an insolvent thereafter. While there were two enormous mortgage debts outstanding against him and after he had ceased to pay the instalments and interest thereon, and when he must have been conscious that the lands held by the plaintiffs as security for their loan were rapidly decreasing in value, and in all probability no longer affording sufficient security to enable the Company to realize its loan from them alone, he voluntarily and deliberately presents to his wife and daughter the whole of his remaining property, denuding himself of everything and depriving his creditors, the mortgagees, of any practical remedy they might have against him upon his personal covenant, and leaving them to their remedy against the mortgaged lands alone. I cannot conceive a more glaring infraction of the Statute of Elizabeth than this case affords, opposed as the conduct of the deceased was to the elementary principles of justice and common sense. The learned trial judge seems to have given judgment in favour of the widow because, as hethought, at the time of the transactions impeached, the deceased was solvent and therefore in a position to make a voluntary conveyance. He admits that after the conveyances and gifts he was insolvent; that at the time of his death he was insolvent; and he shut off during the trial further evidence as to the depreciation of the real estate in question since the execution of the original mortgages, but appears to have lost sight of the principle that where at any time a person is solvent and then makes a voluntary conveyance the effect of which is to make him insolvent, the settle- ment is void, and that too, no matter what the intent of the settlor was.\nLord Hatherley, in the leading case of Freeman v. Pope,[2] lays down the principle as follows at p. 541 :\nIn Spirett v. Willows[3] the settlor, being solvent at the time, but having contracted a considerable debt which would fall due in the course of a few weeks, made a voluntary settlement by which he withdrew a large portion of his property from the payment of debts, after which he collected the rest of his assets and (apparently in the most reckless and profligate manner) spent them, thus depriving the expectant creditor of the means of being paid. In that case there was clear and plain evidence of an actual intention to defeat creditors. But it is established by the authorities that in the absence of any such direct proof of intention, if a person owing debts makes a settlement which subtracts from the property which is the proper fund for the payment of those debts, an amount without which the debts cannot be paid, then, since it is the necessary consequence of the settlement (supposing it effectual) that some creditors must remain unpaid, it would be the duty of the judge to direct the jury that they must infer the intent of the settlor to have been to defeat or delay his creditors, and that the case is within the statute.\nAnd that case has been followed in this court on several occasions. So much for the main question. If there ever was a case where a man's generosity was at the expense of his justice it is the present case, and equity demands that so much of the subject matter of his generosity as will be sufficient to discharge his debts should be restored to his estate.\nBut it is said that inasmuch as the plaintiffs are mortgage creditors, they are not creditors within the statute of Elizabeth, and cannot bring this action. I do not think that the mere fact of a creditor having something in pawn, or pledge, or hypothec or mortgage, destroys his character as creditor, or deprives him of the right which the statute gives a creditor. If, however, he is a secured creditor, if he has sufficient of the assets of the debtor in his hands to fully cover the indebtedness, then undoubtedly the statute was not intended for him, but for the general andjunsecured creditors. The cases, at all events those by which we are bound, assume when dealing with the question of secured creditors that the security is ample for its purpose. But the authorities show, as May points out, (2 ed. p. 164),\nthat if the property mortgaged is not sufficient to satisfy the debt (as is the case here), the mortgagee of course will be a creditor for the balance.\nAn Ontario case, Crombie v. Young[4], was cited as authority for the proposition above referred to, but that case is altogether different from this.\nIn that case it was shewn that at the time of the impeached transaction, a donation from a husband to his wife, the settlor was perfectly solvent after the conveyance, still possessing other lands and a large interest in the mortgaged property, far in excess of the mortgage. And it was held, whether rightly or wrongly, that under these circumstances, any intent to hinder or delay could not be imputed to him. As already shown the facts here are the reverse of those in Crombie v. Young[5]. At the time of the impeached conveyances (and all evidence of intent except at that particular time is irrelevant), the mortgaged lands were probably wholly insufficient to pay the mortgage debt, and the voluntary conveyances themselves forever precluded the settlor from having any means of making up the shortage.\nNo authority was cited to us to show that before a creditor, having admittedly insufficient security, can bring suit under the statute of Elizabeth he must first realise his security. That question may properly be raised in an administration suit, but the mere fact of such non\u2014realisation is not, in my view, a defence. Finally, the judgment of the learned trial judge dismissing the action against the defendant, Ellen Elliott, and setting aside the conveyance in favour of the defendant, Mary Logan, was entered on the 8th of May, 1899, and an appeal was taken from that judgment in due form on the 29th of May. Subsequently, the learned trial judge prepared a written statement of his reasons for judgments, these reasons, although prepared after judgment, forming part of the case, and as they are brief, I insert them here.\nI am now told by the registrar that my reasons for judgment are desired on the part of the plaintiff for the purpose of an appeal.\nThere is some misunderstanding as to the position. Mr. Wilson, of counsel for the plaintiff, asked me during his argument upon authorities which he cited, to direct an issue as to the insolvency of the deceased at the time of the impeached transaction, if I should be of opinion that such insolvency was not sufficiently established.\nI had a strong opinion during the trial that the evidence as to insolvency was not directed to the time in question sufficiently as between the plaintiff and Ellen Elliott, and I so intimated and upon further confideration I remained of this opinion.\nBut I informed counsel that I would direct an issue as requested in case the plaintiff was not satisfied to have judgment against Mary Logan with costs, and in favour of Ellen Elliott without costs.\nThese two defendants occupy different positions, and I think the destruction by Mrs. Elliott of the books of the deceased warranted the bringing of the action, although it did not appear that she was actuated by any improper motive in doing so.\nMr. Wilson, after taking time, stated in open court, during the sitting of the twenty-first of April last, that as I understood him, he elected to take judgment in the terms mentioned which were taken down by the registrar, and initialed by me, and judgment formally given accordingly.\nI do not, for myself, see how the facts stated by the learned Chief Justice in any way can affect the rights of the plaintiff to appeal from the judgment previously rendered. If we are to accept the directions of their Lordships of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, who are inclined to treat judgments written, as the present was, after delivery, as ineffectual for any purpose whatever, this document should not have formed part of the case upon appeal, either to the court en banc, or to this court. Brown v. Gugy [6] ; Richer v. Voyer[7].\nMr. Wilson, of counsel for the plaintiff, was satisfied that no additional evidence upon the question of insolvency could be obtained, even if a reference were had, and to insist upon a reference would therefore be useless, and the matter remained there, the judge giving judgment in favour of Ellen Elliott, because, in his view the plaintiff had failed to establish a case against her and, against Mary Logan because they had succeeded in establishing a case against her. It was not a consent judgment in any case of the term, or a compromise. Mr. Wilson, counsel for the plaintiff, both in his factum and on the hearing of the appeal before us, repudiates the idea that there was any intention on his part of compromising. I have always understood a compromise to be a settlement where each party gives away to some extent at least. I can see nothing given away in the present case, either by the plaintiff to the defendant Ellen Elliott, or by her to the plaintiff.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed with costs, together with all costs in the courts below, and judgment entered against the defendant Ellen Elliott setting aside, as against creditors, the conveyance in her favour set out in the amended statement of claim herein, with costs.\nGWYNNE J. (dissenting).\u2014This action was commenced by writ of summons issued out of the Supreme Court of British Columbia upon the 23rd day of August, 1897, against Ellen Elliott and Mary Logan as the defendants thereto.\nIn their statement of claim the plaintiffs allege that on the 29th day of December, 1892, one Henry Elliott (since deceased, the husband of the defendant Ellen Elliott, and father of the defendant, Mary Logan), executed to the plaintiffs an indenture of mortgage of certain lands therein mentioned for securing repayment to the plaintiffs of the sum of twelve thousand dollars then lent by the plaintiffs to the said Henry Elliott, together with interest thereon at the rate of eight per cent per annum. That upon the 19th of February, 1894, the said Henry Elliott conveyed to the defendant Ellen Elliott, his wife, certain lands and tenements in the province of British Columbia in the statement of claim mentioned, and that upon the 29th day of October. 1894, he conveyed to his daughter, the defendant, Mary Logan, certain lands in the statement of claim particlarly mentioned, also situate in the Province of British Columbia. That the said Henry Elliott departed this life insolvent on or about the 7th day of November, 1896, and that one Charles George Major had been appointed administrator of his personal estate and effects. That on the 17th day of August, 1897, the plaintiffs recovered judgment by default against the said administrator for the sum of $13,467.20, and $21 73\/100 costs.\nThe statement of claim then contains the paragraph following:\nThe plaintiff company say that the said Henry Elliott being to the knowledge of the defendants at that time in insolvent circumstances, or unable to pay his debts in full, and at the same time indebted to the plaintiff company in divers large sums of money, conveyed the said hereditaments to the defendants voluntarily and without consideration, and with intent to delay, hinder and defraud the plaintiff company and other the creditors of the said Henry Elliott in the payment of their just debts.\nAnd the statement of claim prayed that the said conveyances be declared to be void as against the plaintiffs and all other creditors of the said Henry Elliott.\nNow this statement of claim is in the precise form of the ordinary claim of a creditor who has proceeded or is proceeding to judgment, to set aside a voluntary conveyance as executed with the intent to delay or defeat the particular creditor and all other creditors from obtaining the fruits of a judgment recovered or to be recovered. In such cases the court goes no further than to avoid the deed in the event of a proper case being established leaving the several creditors to proceed by execution upon their judgments when recovered. It does not do anything further to assist the plaintiff unless the case made by the bill is one seeking for special relief applicable to the circumstances of the particular case. The defendants denied all the averments in the plaintiff's statement of claim, thus casting on the plaintiffs the burthen of every averment necessary to be established to justify a judgment avoiding the impeached conveyances. They also respectively expressly denied the crucial averment that Henry Elliott was insolvent when the deeds to the defendants were respectively executed.\nAt the trial it appeared that the plaintiffs not only held the mortgage mentioned in the statement of claim (in respect of which the judgment by default mentioned in the statement of claim was recovered) but also that on the 6th January, 1892, the said Henry Elliott and one Benjamin Douglas had executed to the plaintiffs a mortgage on certain lands therein mentioned situate in the City of New Westminster in British Columbia, in security for repayment to the plaintiffs of $45,000 and interest thereon at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum, at the days and times and in the manner in the said indentures of mortgage mentioned. We have not on the record before us copies of these mortgages but only a short statement of their respective dates, of the lands therein respectively mentioned and the amounts thereby respectively secured: but they, no doubt, contained the powers of sale and lease on default usually inserted in all mortgages in British Columbia. It appeared also that upon the land mentioned in the mortgage of the 5th January, 1892, there were erected valuable buildings which in the year 1893 were leased at the sum of ($600 00) six hundred dollars per month and that the plaintiffs have been for some time in possession of these buildings receiving as mortgagees in possession the rents issuing thereout. What rents they are receiving now they did not shew, but they did admit on cross-examination that in the interval between the 1st December, 1896, and the 1st July, 1898, they received as such rents the sum of $7,503.60. It was also extracted from a witness of the plaintiffs that the lands in that mortgage were in 1894 of the value of $65,000.00 and that the buildings thereon were insured to the amount of $40,000.00\nThen as to the 905 acres in the mortgage in the statement of claim mentioned one witness called by the plaintiffs valued these lands at ($10) ten dollars per acre, while another also called by the plaintiffs testified that in 1884 and at the present time these lands were well worth from ($15.00 to $20.00) fifteen to twenty dollars per acre, thus shewing at the lowest of these two last sums or $15.00 per acre the whole 905 acres to be worth $13,575.00 and at the mean between the two sums, or $17.50 per acre to be worth $16,837.50.\nIn a case like the present impeaching conveyances upon the ground of fraud the plaintiffs have no right to claim that more reliance should be placed on the testimony produced by them which placed the value of the lands at $10.00 per acre than upon the testimony of the witness also put forward by them to speak to value and who valued the same lands as well worth from $15.00 to $20.00 per acre. Wehave thus the value of the mortgaged lands to be : That the lands in the mortgage of the 6th of January, 1892, were, and so far as appears in the evidence still are worth the sum of $65,000.00 and are insured for $40.000, while the lands in the mortgage, in the statement of claim mentioned, were in 1894 and still are worth from $13,575.00 to $16,837 50 against which it was also extracted from the plaintiffs' witness that upon the 10th of February and and the 29th of October, 1894, the dates of the execution of the respective conveyances which are impeached the total amount due upon both mortgages together was $52,570.00, and upon the 1st of November, 1895, after the decease of Henry Elliott the sum of $52,500.00, of which sum if we attribute $12,500.00 to the mortgage in the statement of claim mentioned would leave only $40,000.00 due on 1st November, 1895, upon the other of which no mention is made in the pleadings, the whole of which sum was also covered by insurance.\nThis was the whole of the material evidence given in the case; all else was irrelevant, save that the only debts shewn in the evidence to have existed at the time of the decease of Henry Elliott independently of the plaintiffs' mortgage securities was the sum of $22.05 for a gas account and some taxes which being secured by liens on the lands assessed cannot be taken into consideration upon a question arising under the statute 13 Eliz. c. 5.\nUpon this evidence the only judgment which upon the whole current of the authorities was warranted even if the plaintiffs were persons competent to maintain the action as set out in the statement of claim was a judgment dismissing the action with costs. Lord Townshend v. Windham[8] ; Stephens v. Olive[9] ; Doe d. Garnons v. Knight [10]\nIn Lush v. Wilkinson[11], which was the case of a bill filed by a subsequent judgment creditor to set aside a post marriage voluntary settlement made by a husband in favour of his wife as void within 13 Eliz. c. 5, no antecedent debt was proved, but the plaintiff having asked for an inquiry as to antecedent debts Lord Alvanley dismissed the bill giving leave to file another.\nSir William Grant in Kidney v Coussmaker[12] referring to this case, said that as that bill had charged insolvency at the time of the execution of the voluntary settlement, and no proof was given of any debt in existence at that time,\nthe only reason for surprise was that Lord Alvanley did not absolutely dismiss the bill instead of giving leave to file another.\nThe only exception to the rule that a creditor subsequent to a voluntary deed can only set it aside upon proof of some antecedent debts or debt is if the evidence be such as to warrant the conclusion that the voluntary deed was executed with the design and intent of incurring future debts, and of defeating them by the voluntary deed. But we have here no such case. Moreover, as upon the appeal from the judgment of the learned trial judge the court offered the plaintiffs an inquiry as to antecedent debts which they declined to accept, we may reasonably conclude that they could supply no evidence upon the point, and the fact may be regarded as established that no such debt did exist in so far at least as this action between the plaintiffs and defendants was concerned, and that therefore the deeds which in the statement of claim are impeached have not been effectually impeached.\nBut the plaintiffs being creditors of Henry Elliott, deceased, holding mortgages upon real estate in security for their debt are not creditors within 13 Eliz. c. 5, that is to say, in the language of May at p. 141 of his book giving the rationale of the authorities upon the point :\nThe enactment is clearly intended to prevent persons from conveying away the whole or any part of their property in derogation of the rights of those who as general creditors have a claim on the generalassets of their debtor. Mortgagees therefore who have a specific portion of land set aside, and so far as their interest is concerned, freed from liability to the general creditors, and to which they can primarily at least, resort for the satisfaction of their claim are not to be regarded as \"creditors,\" or at least a mortgage debt is not properly speaking a debt for the purposes of the statute.\nAnd so even in the case of the general creditors filing a bill for the administration of the estate of a deceased person, and therein seeking to set aside a voluntary conveyance as a fraud upon creditors within the statute 13 Eliz. c. 5, upon the question whether at the time of the execution of the impeached conveyance the settlor had creditors, with intent to defraud when the impeached conveyance can be said to have been executed, debts secured by mortgage are not to be taken into consideration\nThe learned counsel for the plaintiffs felt himself compelled to admit, as indeed he could not do otherwise, that the plaintiffs could not on their own behalf maintain the present action, but he contended that the present action was maintainable upon the ground of its being, as he contended, an action on behalf of all creditors of the deceased as of the plaintiffs themselves referring to a passage in Mr. May's book, (p. 466,) which is in these words : The bill ought to be filed by a creditor or creditors on behalf of himself or themselves and all other the unsatisfied creditors of the settlor deceased, citing French v. French[13].\nWhat Mr. May is there referring to, as plainly appears by the case cited, is the case of a bill filed by one simple contract creditor upon behalf of himself and all other the creditors of a deceased person for an administration of the assets of the deceased, and praying for the avoidance of a voluntary conveyance standing in the way of such creditors. That such an action must be instituted by one or more creditors on behalf of all is a very different thing from saying that a mortgagee, whose interests are quite distinct from the interests of the general unsecured creditors, can by assuming to act on behalf of himself and all other creditors of a deceased person invoke the court to set aside a conveyance which is impeachable only as standing in the way of the general creditors in which number as we have seen the mortgagee is not to be counted.\nNo case has been cited in support of such a proposition, nor is there any sense in saying that what a mortgagee could not effect in a suit instituted on behalf of himself alone he can effect by professing to act on behalf of himself and others whose interests are wholly distinct from his. Moreover as already observed this action is not in form an action on behalf of all the creditors of the deceased. No relief is sought other than the mere avoidance of the deeds impeached, upon which relief being granted the court goes no further but leaves all the creditors to avail themselves of their rights as best they may\u2014no other relief is asked for in the present action and the plaintiffs declare themselves to be ready to seize the property to satisfy their judgment. The case of French v. French is reported in 1 Jur. N. S. 840; 2 Jur. N S. 169 and 6 DeG. M. & G. 95. In the first of these reports the bill is shewn to have been filed by a simple contract creditor on behalf of himself and all other the creditors of a deceased person for an administration of the assets of the deceased and to set aside a voluntary settlement as fraudulent within the statute 13 Eliz. c. 5 against such creditors, and the bill prayed that an account might be taken of the personal estate and effects of the deceased, and that it might be declared that an annuity granted by the impeached instrument was as against the creditors of the deceased fraudulent, and that the wife in whose favour the annuity was granted might be declared trustee thereof for the benefit of such creditors, and that a receiver might be appointed. In 2 Jur. N. S. 170 the form of the decree pronounced in the case is given as follows:\nThere will be a declaration that the settlement of 1852 (the impeached conveyance) was void as against creditors and the accounts will be taken on that footing, without prejudice to any question that may be raised by Mrs. French in case the assets should turn out to be more than sufficient to pay all the debts.\nThat this suit must have been instituted by a creditor upon behalf of himself and all other creditors entitled to share in the general assets of the deceased there can be no doubt; but the present is not a case like that and here it is to be observed how careful the court was to provide for protection of the interests of the volunteer beneficiary. To such a suit a mortgagee would have been an unnecessary party, for when a mortgagor dies leaving lands mortgaged and other lands and personal estate not mortgaged the only assets of the deceased to be administered for the benefit of creditors are the equity of redemption in the mortgaged lands and the residue of the deceased's estate, real and personal. To a bill by the general creditors of the deceased the mortgagee cannot be called upon to take any part; the equity of redemption in the mortgaged premises may be sold in such administration suit but not so as in any way to prejudice or interfere with the exercise by the mortgagee of all his rights under the mortgage. He may sell the whole estate absolutely under the powers of sale ordinarily inserted in all mortgages executed in every province of the Dominion. He may by petition be admitted into the administration suit and consent to a sale therein of the mortgaged premises, he receiving the whole of the proceeds of such sale until his mortgage debt, interest and costs are fully paid. In such a case he must submit to rendering an account of all monies received by him in respect of the mortgage and the decree is for the taking of such account and for sale of the mortgaged premises with the mortgagee's consent, and if the proceeds of the sale should prove insufficient to pay the mortgage debt, interest and costs, that then he should be admitted to prove for the balance not realized as a specialty creditor.\nThe cases are numerous but uniform on this subject. A few will suffice : Mason v. Bogg[14] ; Greenwood v. Taylor [15]; Carr v. Henderson[16] ; Ward v. McKinley[17] ; Crowle v. Russell[18].\nA mortgagee may also himself file a bill for an administration of the estate of the deceased. In such case he must render an account of all his receipts and dealings in respect of the mortgaged premises and shall retain his right to have the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged premises applied wholly in payment of his mortgage debt, interest and costs, and in case of the proceeds of sale proving insufficient for that purpose, he shall be allowed to prove for the unsatisfied balance as in the case of his applying by petition to be let into an administration suit instituted by the general creditors and consenting to a sale of the mortgaged premises in that suit. Brocklehurst v. Jessop[19] ; Tipping v. Power[20] ; King v. Smith[21] ; Aldridge v. Westbrook[22] ; Skey v. Bennett[23] ; Spensley v. Harrison[24] ; Pinchard v. Fellows[25].\nThe decree in Pinchard v. Fellows[26] shews the form of decree in such cases. The decree directed an account to be taken of what was due to the plaintiff for principal, interest and costs of suit, including the costs of the account and consequent on the sale thereafter directed\u2014account of the rents and profits of the mortgaged premises received by the plaintiff or which without wilful default might have been received, deducting what should appear to be due on such account of rents and profits from what appeared to be due to the plaintiff for principal, interest and costs. Lands comprised in plaintiffs' mortgages to be sold with the approbation of the judge and the money to arise by such sale to be paid into court; and that thereout on an application in chambers what should be certified to be due to the plaintiff be paid to him; but in case the money to arise by the sale should be insufficient to discharge the said amount to be so certified to be due to the plaintiff then the whole thereof to be paid to him. In case such monies should be insufficient to pay the amount due to the plaintiff he was declared entitled to come in with the other creditors of the deceased and to receive satisfaction for such deficiency out of the deceased's assets in a due course of administration. Now, in the present case, to a bill filed by the plaintiffs for administration of the deceased Henry Elliott's estate, his co-mortgagor, Benjamin Douglas, if living, and his representatives if dead, must needs be a party or parties. No such bill having been instituted it is quite obvious, as indeed the frame of the statement of claim also shews, that the plaintiffs are standing upon what they consider to be their rights distinct from, and not, by any means, in concert with the general creditors, if there be any, of Henry Elliott, deceased.\nThe evidence adduced by the plaintiffs seems to shew that in truth the plaintiffs are the sole creditors of the deceased, for they proved that the whole amount of deceased debts, so far as known, amounted to something over $50,000, how much was not stated and the plaintiffs gave evidence that the amount due to them by the deceased at the time of his death was $52,500. The only debts spoken of were the $22.05 for the gas account and the taxes already referred to, but the point in issue in the case is not whether the deceased was indebted at the time of his death, but at the times when he executed the impeached conveyances, and no debt whatever was proved to have then been in existence but the debt to the plaintiffs secured by mortgage, and as the evidence shewed amply secured.\nIn so far as the present action is concerned there is no other conclusion justified by the evidence and by the fact that the plaintiffs refused the opportunity for further inquiries as to the indebtedness of Henry Elliott at the time of the execution of the impeached conveyances than that the said Henry Elliott was free from all debt, save that secured to the plaintiffs at the times of execution of the said conveyances and had a perfect right to execute them without any interference on the part of the plaintiffs. The only judgment therefore, which was justified by the evidence was one dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs, and the appeal, therefore, in my opinion, must be dismisssed with costs.\nThe defendant, Mary Logan, not having appealed from the judgment rendered against her we can not deal with it, but I apprehend that means can readily be found to prevent the plaintiffs attempting, if they should attempt, to enforce an execution against the lands mentioned in Mary Logan's deed to obtain satisfaction of the judgment in the statement of claim mentioned to have been recovered against the administrator of the estate of Henry Ellliott, or of any part thereof.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wilson & Senkler.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Morrison & Cockrill.\n[1] 7 B.
