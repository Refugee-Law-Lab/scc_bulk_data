Montreal Terminal Railway Company, (1905) 35 SCR 478\nDate: 1905-01-20\nTHE MONTREAL STREET RAILWAY COMPANY\nAppellant;\nAnd\nTHE MONTREAL TERMINAL RAILWAY COMPANY AND THE BOARD OF RAILWAY COMMISSIONERS FOR CANADA\nRespondents.\n1905: Jan 20\nPRESENT:\u2014His Lordship Mr. Justice Sedgewick (in chambers).\nRAILWAY COMPANY AND THE BOARD OF RAILWAY COMMISSIONERS FOR CANADA\nON APPEAL FROM THE BOARD OF RAILWAY COMMISSIONERS FOR CANADA.\nAppeal\u2014Special leave\u2014\"Railway Act, 1903''\u2014Order of Board of Railway Commissioners\u2014Use of public streets\u2014Removal of tracks\u2014Constitutional law\u2014Property and civil rights\u2014Jurisdiction of board\u2014 Imposing terms.\nWhere the judge entertained doubt as to the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada to make the order complained of and the questions raised were of public importance, special leave for an appeal was granted, on terms, under the provisions of sec. 44 (3) of \" The Railway Act, 1903.\"\nPETITION for leave to appeal from an order of the board of railway commissioners for canada made on the 27th of december, 1904, directing the removal of the rails of the montreal street railway company on pius ix. avenue in the town of maisonneuve.\nThe petitioners are incorporated for the purpose of constructing and operating an electric passenger railway on the Island of Montreal and given the necessary powers for that purpose under the several acts of the legislature of the Province of Quebec and, in the exercise of their statutory powers, they laid a double line of rails along Pius IX. avenue in the Town of Maisonneuve, about the 15th of October, 1904. The respondent company are incorporated under a provincial statute and declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada by enactments of Parliament, giving them powers; also, to construct and operate an electric railway on the Island of Montreal. They are constructing a railway through the Town of Maisonneuve which will intersect Pius IX. avenue and on 27th December, 1904, they obtained an order from the Board of Rail-way Commissioners for Canada directing the petitioners, at their own cost and expense, within forty-eight hours after service of such order upon them, to remove their double line of rails on Pius IX. avenue at the intersection of Ernest street and restore the roadway as nearly as possible to its original condition, the costs of the application of the respondents for the order in question to be paid by the appellants. Leave to appeal is sought under the provisions of sec. 44 (3) of the \u201cRailway Act, 1903.\"\nCampbell K.C. for the petition. The board had no jurisdiction to make the order, because the respondent company had no power to construct the line of railway as they proposed to do at the place in question, while the petitioners had such power and the line they had constructed was their property. The order could not be carried out without interfering with property and civil rights which are subject exclusively to provincial jurisdiction. The Railway Act of 1903 does not and cannot authorise the board to allow Dominion railways to use the streets belonging to municipalities nor to interfere with property and civil rights in a province. Section seven refers only to connections and crossings and does not bring provincial railways within the purview of the Act as regards the removal and alteration of their physical condition. If it is to be so construed, it is ultra vires to that extent.\nThese are all matters of great public importance and should entitle us to leave for an appeal. A. G. Blair for the Board of Railway Commissioners. We do not oppose the granting of leave for an appeal although we consider that the order in question was necessary to enforce two former orders made in June and September, 1904, in respect to the construction of the Montreal Terminal Railway and was perfectly justified under the circumstances and by sub-section (a) of section 23 of the Railway Act, 1903.\nDandurand K.C. and Belcourt K.C. for the Montreal Terminal Railway Co. We oppose the petition on the ground that the order was within the jurisdiction of the board under sec. 23 (a) of the Act and necessary for the enforcement of the former orders made in June and September, which are clearly within the jurisdiction of the board. The order does not affect the status of the petitioners and only affects their property to the extent necessary for our crossing. This is a matter clearly within the jurisdiction of the board.\nThe petitioners have merely laid a few rails, without connections at either end with any part of their system; their sole purpose is to obstruct the construction of our line and if leave for the appeal should be granted there should be terms imposed to prevent delays and to allow us to go on with our construction.\nSEDGEWICK J. (Oral).\u2014I have read the petition and the clauses of the \" Railway Act, 1903,\" which affect the case and it appears to me, on the face of the proceedings, that there is grave doubt as to the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners to make the order complained of and whether or not it amounts to an interference with a matter falling exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court for the District of Montreal. It is possible that the proper course would have been to proceed before the provincial court by way of injunction or some other appropriate action. I think the questions raised of sufficient public importance to call for a decision of this court as to the conflict of jurisdiction and the construction of the provisions of the statute constituting the Board of Railway Commissioners and defining their powers. I therefore grant leave for the appeal as prayed for, on the understanding that the case shall be inscribed for hearing at the next session of the Supreme Court of Canada. I also consider it proper, in the exercise of my discretion, to impose terms, (all parties assenting thereto), and to order that, while the appeal is pending, the Montreal Terminal Railway Company may, at any time, remove the rails of the Montreal Street Railway Company so far as may be necessary for the construction of their railway across Pius IX. avenue, in the Town of Maisonneuve, subject to replacement should the final decision of the appeal require it.\nThe costs of the present application will be costs in the cause.\nPetition granted.\nSolicitors for the petitioners : Campbell, Meredith, Macpherson & Hague.\n",

Any poles remaining in Arnprior over one month after they are in shipping condition to be paid for on estimate in thirty days therefrom less 2 per cent discount. * * For shipments cash 30 days from dates of invoices less 2 per cent discount.\u201d\nHeld, that for poles not shipped P. was not obliged to pay on the expiration of one month after they were in shipping condition\u2019 but only after 30 days from receipt of the estimate of such poles.\nM. refused to deliver logs that had been on the ground one month without previous payment and P. brought an action for specific performance and damages claiming that he could not be called upon to pay until the poles were inspected and passed by him, and also that M. should supply the cars. M. counterclaimed for the price of the poles.\nHeld, Sedgewick and Killam JJ. dissenting, that each party had misconceived his rights under the contract, and no judgment could be rendered for either.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment for the plaintiff at the trial and ordering the judgment to be entered for the defendants on their counterclaim.\nThe material facts are set out in the head-note. Watson K.C. and Slattery for the appellants.\nS.H. Blake K.C. and Henderson for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies.\nSEDGEWICK J. (dissenting).\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Killam.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I also concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The rights of the parties are to be determined as they existed on the 20th August, 1902, the date of the issue of the writ.\nThe agreement out of which the dispute arose is badly drawn and it is somewhat difficult to discover its real meaning. I agree, however, so far as the time for payment is concerned, with the trial judge and Mr. Justice Garrow and, as I gather from his reasons Mr. Justice Maclaren, that the purchaser, the plaintiff in the action, was to have thirty days for payment alike from the delivery of the invoice in cases of actual delivery of the logs, as from delivery of the estimate where the logs had been over a month at Arnprior in shipping condition. On this latter point I cannot agree with the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal that the payment could be exacted (where actual delivery had not taken place) at the expiration of a month after the logs had been at Arnprior for one month whether vendee had notice or not. It seems to me to be a more reasonable construction that the vendee was to have a month for payment alike in cases of delivery and non-delivery after, in the one case, he received the invoice and, in the other, the estimate of the logs which were ready for delivery and had been in shipping condition for a month. I agree that the plaintiff had to supply the cars and the. defendants load them.\nI think both parties misconceived their rights under the agreement; the plaintiff was wrong in claiming that the cars should be supplied by the defendant and that he could not be called upon to pay for any poles unless they were first inspected and passed by him; the defendants were wrong in insisting that they had a right to immediate payment when the logs were on the ground a month and that without payment they could not be called upon to deliver.\nI cannot see in any case how judgment could be given for defendant on his counterclaim. Under any construction of the contract the onus lies upon him of proving affirmatively that the poles, for which payment is claimed, were in a shipping condition for a month at Arnprior. The trial judge made no finding on this nor does the Court of Appeal. I cannot say the evidence establishes the fact. Both parties being at fault and misinterpretating the contract at the time the action was brought, the circumstances do not warrant a judgment being rendered for either. I would, therefore, allow the appeal, dismiss the action and the counterclaim without costs here or in the courts below.\nKILLAM J. (dissenting)\u2014I agree with the view taken by Mr. Justice MacMahon by whom the action was tried, and by Mr. Justice Garrow, in the Court of Appeal, as to the construction of the contract in question. It appears to me that the defendants were wrong in claiming that the amount of the estimate was payable immediately and in refusing to deliver further logs until this was paid. And it does not appear to me that the plaintiff\u2019s contentions were such as to disentitle him to hold the defendants in default. They may have been untenable but they did not amount to a repudiation of the contract on the part of the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel has argued the case before us upon the contention that the defendants\u2019 refusal to deliver further logs without payment of the amount of their estimates constituted such a repudiation of their contract as gave the plaintiff the right to sue for damages as for its breach. But even assuming that under the principles of the cases of Hochster v. De la Tour[1]; Danube & Black Sea Railway etc. Co. v. Xenos[2]; Withers v. Reynolds[3]; and the Mersey Steel & Iron Co.v. Naylor Benzon & Co.[4], the plaintiff was entitled to rescind the contract and sue for damages as at common law, I think that he precluded himself from taking this position. I would refer in this connection to the principles laid down by Lord Esher M.R. in Johnstone v. Milling[5] at page 467:\nWhen one party assumes to renounce the contract, that is, by anticipation refuses to perform it, he thereby, so far as he is concerned, declares his intention then and there to rescind the contract. Such a renunciation does not of course amount to a rescission of the contract, because one party to a contract cannot by himself rescind it, but by wrongfully making such a renunciation of the contract he entitles the other party, if he pleases, to agree to the contract being put an end to, subject to the retention by him of his right to bring an action in respect of such wrongful rescission. The other party may adopt such renunciation of the contract by so acting upon it as in effect to declare, that he too treats the contract as at an end, except for the purpose of bringing an action upon it for the damages sustained by him in consequence of such renunciation. He cannot, however, himself proceed with the contract on the footing that it still exists for other purposes, and also treat such renunciation as an immediate breach. If he adopts the renunciation the contract is at an end except for the purposes of the action for such wrongful renunciation; if he does not wish to do so he must wait for the arrival of the time when in the ordinary course a cause of action on the contract would arise. He must elect which course he will pursue. Such appears to me to be the only doctrine recognized by the law with regard to anticipatory breach of contract.\nSee also Frost v. Knight[6].\nThe plaintiff did not elect to rescind the contract. On the contrary he elected to insist upon its performance. On the 7th August, 1902, his solicitor wrote to the defendants:\u2014\nMr. Phelps is still willing to carry out his contract and will ask you to do the same. * * * My instructions are to enter proceedings to have the contract enforced and for damages. If I have no word from you by the 9th instant that you are willing that the contract should be carried out I will proceed on instructions.\nOn the 20th August the action was begun. At that time the thirty days which, in my view, were to be allowed for payment had not elapsed; the plaintiff was not then in default. When he filed his statement of claim the plaintiff asked for specific performance of the agreement. It is true that he asked also for damages, but it is clear that at the time that he began the action he had not taken and he was not thereby taking the position of rescinding the contract so as to entitle him to damages as at common law. By their statement of defence the defendants denied any breach of the contract but stated that they were still ready and willing to have it performed and to perform it on their part. For these reasons I think that the decree of the court for specific performance should stand.\nIt is now urged on the part of the plaintiff that, after the lapse of time which has intervened, and which, it is claimed, was due to the defendants\u2019 course in contesting the action as they have done, it is unjust to compel the plaintiff to perform the contract and to accept the logs. Probably such delay would be in many cases a ground for the exercise by the court of the equitable jurisdiction under Lord Cairns\u2019s Act to award damages in lieu of specific performance, but it does not appear to me that in the present case this should be done. The plaintiff asked for specific performance. The court has decreed what he asked for. When the statement of claim was filed the time for payment for the logs upon the ground had, in any view of the contract, expired. The plaintiff was then, at least, bound to pay for those that had been left upon the ground on estimate. I cannot doubt that if he had then offered to do so any difficulty in the way of full performance of the contract would have been removed. From the time when the thirty days expired the plaintiff was in default and on that ground I think he should be left to the position in which he placed himself when he began the action.\nI am not satisfied upon the evidence that there had been on the ground, in shipping condition, for the period required by the contract, logs to the number and dimensions estimated by the defendants, which were up to the standard of the contract. The judgment of the Court of Appeal admits that to be doubtful. I would have preferred a decree by which it should first be ascertained what poles were up to contract before the enforcement of the plaintiff\u2019s liability to pay for them. But in view of the opinion of the other members of the court it does not appear important to consider that question any further. I will simply say that I think that either such variation should be made or the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: R.J.

C. c. 182, s. 42.\nThe venue mentioned in section 609 of the Criminal Code, 1892, means the place where the crime is charged to have been committed and, in cases where local description is not required, there is an implied allegation that the offence was committed at the place mentioned in the venue in the margin of the record. It is of no consequence whether or not the trial court should he considered an inferior court.\nUnder section 42 of \"The Penitentiary Act,\" R. S. C. chap 182, a copy of the sentence of the trial court certified by a judge or by the clerk or acting clerk of that court is a sufficient warrant for the commitment and detention of the convict.\nJudgment appealed from (35 Can. S. C. R. 189) affirmed.\nAppeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Davies, in chambers[1], refusing the application of the appellant for a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the cause of bis imprisonment in the Penitentiary at Dorchester, N.B., on a conviction in a County Court Judges' Criminal Court, under the provisions of Part LIV. of \"The Criminal Code, 1892,\" for the Speedy Trial of Indictable Offences.\nThe questions raised on the appeal were similar to those raised on the application for the writ of habeas corpus mentioned in the report of the judgment appealed from. John J. Power for the appellant. The forms FF. to the Code are merely examples of the manner of stating offences. See Endlich on Statutes, sec. 71, pp. 91-92. A form given in a schedule, especially if there is no reference to it in the body of the Act, is to be regarded merely as an example. See also the foot note 77, on page 92.\nEvery element must be stated in an indictment as heretofore required by law. Smith v. Moody[2], at page 60-63, per Alverstone C. J., and Wills and Chan-nell JJ.\nThe words \"County of Halifax\" in the margin must denote either (a) the place where the document was drawn up; 1 Burns's Justices of the Peace (30 ed.) 1118, and Austin's Case[3]; or (b) the venue as laid down in section 609 of the Code. The venue is intended to shew where the facts were alleged to have occurred and that the court and jury had jurisdiction in the matter. It was formerly necessary to state the venue expressly in the indictment, or by reference to the venue in the margin in every material allegation. Now, by virtue of sec. 609 of the Code [taken from 18 \"Vict. c. 92, (U.C.) E. S. C. ch. 174, sec. 104, and 14 & 15 Vict. (Imp.) ch. 100, s. 23] it is not necessary to state any venue in the body of any indictment.\nSection 651 of the Code relates to procedure only, and does not authorize any order for the change of the place of trial of a prisoner, in any case where any such change would not have been granted under the former practice; it does away with the old practice of removing the case, by certiorari, into the Queen's Bench, and then moving to change the venue. But if the venue be changed, what of the marginal \"place\" as indicating where the crime was committed. It is submitted, at all events, that the words \"any record\" referred to in s.s. (l) of sec. 3 of the Criminal Code means \"any nisi prius record.\" See sec. 30 of 14 & 15 Yict. (Imp.) ch. 100. By sub-sec. 3 of sec. 764 of the Code the record in any case must be filed in the court. The warrant is a certificate under sec. 42 of the \"Penitentiary Act,\" and is given to the warden of the penitentary through the officer who carries the prisoner, the act of a ministerial officer; it is not a \"record,\" and therefore, is not covered by sec. 609 and sub-sec. (1) of sec. 3 of the Code.\nAs to the distinction of courts of general and limited jurisdiction, see the Lefroy Case[4], and 8 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, (2 ed.) pages 37, 38. Jurisdiction in the County Court Judge's Criminal Court depends on (a) committal for trial or binding over; Code sees. 596, 601, 765; The King v. Komiensky[5] (b) certain crimes; sea 765; or (c) consent of prisoner; secs. 765-767.\nWe also refer to Christie v. Unwin[6], at p. 379; The Queen v. Slavin[7]; Ex parte Macdonald[8]; Case of the Sheriff of Middlesex[9].\nLongley K.C., Attorney General for Nova Scotia, for the Crown. Under the Criminal Code, 1892, and the Dominion statutes respecting the imprisonment of convicts in the penitentiary the warrant in question in this case is a sufficient compliance with the law. I adopt the arguments used in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Davies in the judgment appealed from. There can be no doubt that the marginal venue is a proper and sufficient allegation of the place where the offence charged was committed.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by: Killam J.\u2014We are all of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nBy sec. 609 of the Criminal Code,\nit shall not be necessary to state any venue in the body of any indictment, and the district, county or place named in the margin thereof stall be the venue for all the facts stated in the body of the indictment; but if local description is required such local description shall be given in the body thereof.\nThe word \"venue\" in this section means the place where the crime is charged to have been committed. See Taschereau's Criminal Code, page 671, and 22 Enc. Pl. & Pr., page 819.\nBy sec. 764 of the Criminal Code, and R. S. N. S. (1900) c. 157, county court judges' criminal courts are courts of record. The forms of records for these courts given by the Criminal Code, MM and NN, do not state any place of commitment of the offence. By sec. 3, sub-sec (l), of the Criminal Code, the word \"indictment\" includes \"any record.\" The offence of which the appellant was convicted was not one for which local description was required.\nThe venue in the margin of the record was:\nCanada,\nProvince of Nova Scotia,\nCounty of Halifax.\nThere was, then, by force of the statute, an implied allegation that the offence was committed in the County of Halifax and the Province of Nova Scotia. This was sufficient to show the jurisdiction of the court, and it is unimportant whether that court should or should not be considered an inferior court.\nBy the Penitentiary Act, R. S. C. c. 182, sec. 42, the officer conveying a convict to a penitentiary is to deliver him over without any further warrant than a copy of the sentence taken from the minutes of the court before which the convict was tried and certified by a judge or by the clerk or acting clerk of such court. This was done in the present case and the copy furnished showed a record in a form which satisfied the statute, and which by virtue of the statute showed the jurisdiction of the court.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John J.

Sievert, a tobacco merchant and manufacturer, residing and doing business in Halifax, Nova Scotia, against Samuel M. Brookfield, a builder and contractor, residing and doing business in the same city, for injuries occasioned by the negligence of a servant of the respondent in carelessly and improperly leaving a water tap open and causing the shop and warehouse occupied by the appellant to be flooded with water and his stock in trade seriously injured.\nThe goods were contained in a four storied building, Nos. 187 and 189 Hollis street, in the City of Halifax, which was and. had been for many years occupied by appellant as a yearly tenant, his year expiring May 1st.\nOn June 1st, 1882, one William M. Harrington was the owner of the building and premises, and on that date executed a mortgage thereof to one Brenton H. Collins. William M. Harrington subsequently died and the title to the property became vested in one Emily A. Piers, a trustee under the will of the said William M. Harrington. The Eastern Canada Savings & Loan Company arranged with the Harrington estate to purchase the property, and in consequence of some defect in the title this was carried out by means of a foreclosure sale. Shortly after the sale the loan company's solicitor wrote three letters to the appellant, endeavouring to make some arrangement with him in reference to his vacating the building. Finally, an agreement was arranged and executed, by which appellant was to vacate on 28th February, 1903, and was to be paid $510 and provided with new premises till the first of May at a rental of $55 per month.\nThe appellant did not vacate the premises on Saturday, the 28th of February, 1903, because the new premises to be provided for him under the terms of the agreement were not then ready for occupation, but on Monday the 2nd of March he commenced to move out of the building. He removed his property from the fourth floor on that day. The respondent had a contract with the loan company to remodel and repair the building, and his workmen had for some time previously, by leave of the appellant, been working in the cellar of the premises by preparing the foundation for a vault, and on Tuesday, the 3rd of March, respondent's workmen entered the fourth story for the purpose of tearing down the plaster and partitions. In the room where the work began there was a tap connected with the city water supply pipe, with a catch basin and waste pipe, and on Tuesday afternoon one of the workmen, named Moore, turned the tap for the purpose of cleaning out the basin and could not say that he turned it back again. The workmen, when working in the room where the basin was, covered it with a board to keep the plaster from dropping into the basin and when they had finished working in that room they removed the board and washed out the basin but did not turn off the water. Work was then proceeded with in the next room where the knocking down of the plaster upon the wall opposite the basin would drive plaster through into the first-mentioned room and into the basin. The second, third and fourth stories are entirely separate from the ground floor and basement and are reached by a separate street door. When the workmen left, on Tuesday evening, the door leading to the upper stories was locked and was not opened until Wednesday morning.\nOn Wednesday morning the plaintiff found the three lower stories of the building saturated with water which had flowed from the tap in question, and that his stock in trade, and tobacco in course of manufacture, had been very seriously injured. This action was accordingly brought and on the trial questions were submitted to the jury which, with their answers, are as follows:\n\"I. Q. What was the nature of the plaintiff's occupation of the building between the end of the last day of February and the time of the flooding? (Answer fully.)\n\"A. Tacit consent of the loan company.\n\"II. Q. If you say that he was in possession with the assent, tacit or otherwise, of the loan company state the grounds on which you base such finding?\n\"A. Because the store which was promised him in the agreement with Mrs. Piers was not ready for occupancy according to the evidence of Mr. Sievert, which was not contradicted, and the keys not delivered up.\n\"III. Q. Did the defendant's workmen enter the building for the purpose of taking possession of the whole premises or only of that part in which they intended to carry on the work?\n\" A. Not that day.\n\"IV. Q. Was the injury to plaintiff's goods caused by the negligence of defendant's servant?\n\"A. Yes.\n\"V. Q. If so, was the act or neglect of the defendant's servant in regard to a matter within the scope of his authority?\n\"A. Yes.\n\"VI. Q. What damages has plaintiff sustained in consequence of defendant's negligence?\n\"A. One thousand dollars.\"\nUpon the findings of the jury, Mr. Justice Meagher directed judgment to be entered for the sum of $1,000 and costs.\nThe defendant moved before the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc for a new trial of the action and the plaintiff also moved for a new trial as to damages alone. The defendant's motion was granted and the motion by the plaintiff was refused. The plaintiff now appeals from the order granting a new trial generally.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. and Lovett for the appellant. The verdict ought not to have been set aside as there was ample evidence in support of the findings. The jury were entitled and bound to draw all the necessary inferences and ought, in fact, to have given larger damages. See Byrne v. Boadle[1]; The Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Rainville[2], [affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada[3] on appeal], remarks by Osier J. at page 249 and cases there refererred to; Dublin, Wicklow & Wexford Railway Co. v. Slattery[4]; Davey v. London & South Western Railway Co.[5], at page 76 per Bowen L. J.; Re Leeds & Hanley Theatres[6], at page 7. The negligent acts of respondent's servants were in regard to a matter within the scope of, or incident to, their employment, and the jury has made an express finding of fact to this effect. Whiteley v. Pepper[7]; Limpus v. London General Omnibus Co.[8]; Ruddiman v. Smith[9]; Abelson v. Brockman[10]; Stevens v. Woodward[11] at page 320; Whitehead v. Reader[12].\nThe appellant's occupancy of the building was lawful and as of right, or with the consent of the owner. The appellant, under his lease from the Harrington estate, had a good title to the property till May 1st.\nUnder all the circumstances it must be assumed that the owner consented to a delay of two or three days in vacating the premises in accordance with the agreement of January 31st. There are other circumstances tending strongly to show this, besides the new premises not being ready. See Gallagher v. Humphrey[13]; Watkins v. Great Western Railway Co.[14]; York v. Canada Atlantic Steamship Co.[15], per Sedgewick J. at page 171; Harris v. Perry & Co.[16]; Holmes v. North Eastern Railway Co.[17], at page 258, per Channell B.\nIf appellant was a mere licensee respondent is liable for damages caused by his negligent act although not wilful if such act be a wrongful act of commission, or the injury arose from a concealed cause of mischief. Beven on Negligence (2 ed.) p. 525 et seq; Bolch v. Smith[18], at page 742, per \"Wilde B.; Gautret v. Egerton[19]; Burchell v. Hickisson[20]. The turning on and leaving turned on the tap was a wrongful act of commission; it created a concealed cause of mischief. The duty to use ordinary care and skill in order to avoid danger was neglected. Heaven v. Pender[21], at page 509; Hawley v. Wright[22], at page 45, per Sedgewick J. See also Barnes v. Ward[23]: Bird v. Holbrook[24]. This is not a case for the question to be considered as to whether or not the respondent had good reason to suppose, or whether it was probable, that the goods of a trespasser would be on the premises or not, and likely to be injured by the water at the time of the injury. This is not a case of probability but of certainty. The goods were there to the knowledge of the respondent. The negligence complained of is not non-feasance but misfeasance. The injury arose from a concealed cause of mischief, that amounted to a trap. The existence of the basin and waste pipe sufficient to carry the water off, was an intimation to all in the building that no injury would arise from the escape of the water through the tap; it was unnecessary to examine every tap in the building to see that none were left running. The fact that the tap was left open and the basin clogged was concealed from the appellant and the source of the danger was not apparent.\nThe finding in answer to question VI. as to damages is against the weight of evidence. The only evidence as to damage to injured stock was offered by the appellant, was not broken down on cross-examination, and is absolutely uncontradicted. This evidence is amply sufficient to prove the damages to be $2153.86. A new trial may be ordered only as to the question of damages. Judicature Rules, Ord. 37, R. 7; Commercial Bank v. Morrison[25]; Hesse v. St. John Ry Co.[26]; Marsh v. Isaacs[27]. We also refer to Bayley v. Manchester, &c, Railway Co.[28]; Milner v. Great Northern Railway Co.[29]; Marble v. Ross[30]; Herrick v. Wixom[31]; and the cases cited in Roberts & Wallace Employers' Liability Act (ed. 1895) at page 87.\nMellish K.C. and Silver for the respondent. The injury was simply the result of an accident, and was not caused by any wilful or wanton act. The plaintiff had no right whatever to be in the building, he was a trespasser, and the defendant owed to him no duty other than that of abstaining from the infliction of a wilful or wanton injury. This case is governed by the decision in Jones v. Foley[32], and the new trial was properly ordered. See also Beddall v. Maitland[33]; Stone v. Jackson[34]; Jordin v. Crump[35]; Murley v. Grove[36]; and The Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Anderson[37].\nEven if the first finding stands the plaintiff cannot recover, because he thereby becomes only a bare licensee upon the property; he is there without any allurement, inducement or invitation express or implied, on the part of the defendant, and the defendant owes him no duty other than that of abstaining from doing to him or his property a wilful or wanton injury. Beven on Negligence, page 767; Gautret v. Egerton[38]; Wilkinson v. Fairrie[39]; Burchell v. Hickisson[40]; Batchelor v. Fortescue[41]; Ivay v. Hedges[42]; Southcote v. Stanley[43]; Rogers v. Toronto Public School Board[44].\nThe plaintiff's license, if any, was subject to the risks incidental to the projected presence and work of the defendant's workmen, of which the uncontradicted evidence shews the plaintiff had notice, and therefore he cannot recover. Castle v. Parker[45]; Brooks v. Courtney[46]; Southcote v. Stanley (11), Gautret v. Egerton (6). Even if the defendant were gratuitous bailee of the plaintiff's goods, he would not be liable for their injury under the circumstances of this case. Giblin v. McMullen[47]. And a fortiori, he is not liable when he assumed no trust in respect to the goods. The answer to the fourth question is not supported by affirmative evidence, and was properly set aside. The evidence is equally consistent with the absence as with the existence of negligence on the part of the defendant's servants. We rely on the reasons given by Ritchie J. and on Cotton v. Wood[48]; Lovegrove v. The London, Brighton etc. Railway Co.[49], at page 692.\nThe answer to the fifth question was properly set aside; it is not supported by the evidence and the alleged act or neglect of the defendant's servant was not in regard to a matter within the scope of his authority. We rely on the reasons given by Ritchie J. and on the authorities he mentions. See also McKenzie v. McLeod[50]; Mitchell v. Crassweller[51]; Storey v. Ashton[52]; Lamb v. Palk[53].\nSedgewick and Girouard JJ. concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Killam.\nDavies J. (dissenting.)\u2014I agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal for Nova Scotia and would, therefore, dismiss the appeal. The rights and liabilities of the parties as regards each other depend altogether upon the legal character of the occupancy of the premises by the plaintiff at the time his goods were injured. If occupying as of right as against the owner, the latter owed him a duty which involved taking care not to negligently destroy his goods. If there wrongfully it seems to me the duty was limited to the obligation not to do so recklessly, wantonly or wilfully. I agree with the judgment below that he was there as a trespasser or, at the most, as a bare licensee.\nThe defendant was a contractor employed under a contract with the owner, the Eastern Loan Company, in making an alteration in the upper story of the building in a portion of the lower part of which the plaintiff's goods were at the time of the accident. The jury found that the accident was caused by one of the defendant's workmen negligently turning on the water-tap in the room where he was working and not turning it back, in consequence of which the water overflowed the basin and ran down through the floor upon the plaintiff's goods.\nNow, the plaintiff was not there under any lease or agreement with or consent of the owner. As against him he had no right of possession or occupancy. He was, in point of fact, a trespasser in the sense that, after the end of February at any rate, he was unlawfully in possession as against the owner and as against the defendant, who was there as a contractor to carry out the alterations for the owner. He was not even a tenant at will but a tenant at sufferance, at the best. He entered, it is true, by a lawful lease, but held over by wrong. Co. Litt. 57b, cited 3 C. B. 229 note (b). See also Cole on Ejectment, p. 456. There was no contract between the plaintiff and the owner, the Eastern Loan Company, the defendant's employer. The company did not undertake with the plaintiff that their servants would not be guilty of negligence in carrying out the alterations. No duty was cast upon the defendant to take care of the plaintiff's goods, at any rate, none beyond that which a gratuitous bailee undertakes. For gross negligence there might be liability, but, for such negligence as was found in this case, there cannot be any liability unless arising from some duty which the defendant owed the plaintiff to protect his property.\nI think the principle governing the case of Jones v. Foley[54] should apply to the facts here. The owner of the premises, there, was held not to be liable for unavoidable damages caused by his servants to the goods of his overholding tenant in pulling down the roof of the building. The ground upon which this was held was that the defendant was perfectly justified in. pulling down the house; that, although the plaintiff was in occupation of the house with his goods, he had no right whatever there as his tenancy had expired, and that, if he chose to remain improperly in the building with his goods, he did so at his own risk and could not prevent the defendant pulling down the house or exercising his rights as owner, even if such exercise of his rights necessarily and unavoidably injured the goods of the plaintiff. No doubt the defendant would, in that case, have been liable for the wilful, wanton or reckless conduct of his workmen, but it seems to me that, if not liable for such damage as was unavoidably caused to the plaintiff's goods in the removal of the roof, he cannot be held for that which was negligently caused, because there was no duty, on the part of the defendant, to protect the goods or property of the overholding tenant. The facts of this case seem to me very similar.\nThe defendant, as the contractor for the owner, was lawfully in possession of the premises and in actual occupancy of the upper story and also of the cellar. He had a perfectly legal right to carry out such alterations in the building as he pleased. He owed no duty to the plaintiff, who was wrongfully in occupation of part of the premises, to protect the latter's goods. By remaining improperly in occupation of certain rooms in the building and keeping his goods there he did so at his own risk. If in the exercise of his legal rights the defendant had entirely removed the upper story of the building and the rain had poured in and destroyed the plaintiff's goods, the defendant could not, under the principle on which Jones v. Foley[55] was decided, have been held liable for any damages caused thereby. And I take it, the principle on which he should be held not liable is that the plaintiff was there without right, that the defendant was merely exercising his legal rights in altering or removing part of the building, and that, while he must be liable for such gross negligence as is involved in reckless, wanton or wilful acts causing injury to the plaintiff's goods which were known to be in the premises, he cannot be liable for damages caused by the mere negligence of his servants in doing what he had a perfect right to do, because he owed no duty to the plaintiff under the circumstances, and the latter, by wilfully insisting upon remaining where he was, after his legal right to remain had[ceased, must put up with the consequences of his own obstinacy. He could not, by his wrongful act of remaining in occupation of part of the premises, impose a duty upon the defendant.\nI do not think there is any evidence to justify the finding of the jury that the plaintiff was in occupation of the premises with the tacit consent of the owner after the end of February. The evidence is all the other way. The defendant was, therefore, a trespasser, in the sense that he persisted in retaining the occupancy of the rooms after his right to do so had expired. He remained in such occupation with the full knowledge that the defendant's workmen were engaged in pulling the upper part of the premises to pieces, moving all the partitions, knocking down all the plaster, etc., and he must be taken to have elected to continue in his occupation subject to all the risks incident to such occupation while workmen were actually engaged, with his knowledge, in tearing down the walls and ceilings above him.\nThe learned equity judge, who dissented from the majority judgment in the court below, did so upon the ground that the plaintiff's possession was not that of a trespasser or even a bare licensee, but that he had \"a right to possession as distinguished from mere possession.\" i am not able to reach that conclusion under the evidence and, of course, such a conclusion would, necessarily, make a marked difference in the rights and liabilities of the parties towards each other. But, even if the plaintiff was there by the \"tacit consent\" or mere acquiescence of the owner, I take it there would be no difference in the result.\nIn the case of Ivay v. Hedges[56], it was held that where a tenant has the mere privilege of using the roof of the tenement to dry linen on, which roof was flat with an iron rail round the edge, to the knowledge of the landlord out of repair, no duty arises on the landlord's part to protect such a place. The tenant, plaintiff, when going to the roof for the purpose of removing linen, slipped and caught at the rail which gave way so that he fell into the court yard. The landlord was held not liable as owing no duty to the tenant who, as regards the roof, was a mere licensee.\nThe same absence of legal duty is the ground for the decision in Batchelor v. Fortescue[57], and the learned judge, in this latter case, used expressions as to the absence of any such duty in the case of mere licensees which, if good law, would govern the case at bar. Smith J. says, at page 477:\nThere was no duty cast upon the defendant to take due and reasonable care of him.\nAnd Brett M. R. says, at page 479:\nThere was no contract between the defendant and the deceased; the defendant did not undertake with the deceased that his servants should not be guilty of negligence.\nIn commenting on this latter decision, Mr. Beven points out that the existence or non-existence of a contract cannot be a wholly adequate measure of the responsibility of one man with reference to the safety of another and though\nno duty was cast upon the defendants to take care that the deceased should not go to a dangerous place,\nyet, if in full sight of defendants' servants, he were there, they were in a different position with regard to the continuance of operations known to them to be dangerous than if he were not there. This criticism obviously has reference, as I understand it, to the point that what might be mere negligence not involving liability in one set of circumstances might, in different circumstances and relations, amount to gross and wilful negligence for which liability would attach.\nIn Sullivan v. Waters[58] the law is succinctly summed up by Pigot C. B. at page 475, as follows:\nA mere license given by the owner to enter and use premises which the licensee has full opportunity of inspecting which contained no concealed cause of mischief and in which any existing source of danger is apparent, creates no obligation in the owner to guard the licensee against danger.\nIn the case of Sweeny v. Old Colony and Newport Railroad Co.[59], Chief Justice Bigelow thus states the law, at page 374:\nThe true distinction is this; a mere passive acquiescence by the owner or occupier in a certain use of bis land by others involves no liability, but, if he directly or by implication induces persons to enter or pass over his premises, he thereby assumes an obligation that they are in a safe condition, suitable for such use and, for a breach of this obligation, he is liable in damages to a person injured thereby.\nThis, he adds, is the pivot on which the cases turn.\nUnder these principles and authorities, even if the plaintiff was in occupation by the \"tacit consent\" or mere acquiescence of the owner, I would still be of opinion that, for the negligence proved, there was no liability. Nesbitt J. (dissenting). \u2014 I would dismiss this appeal upon two grounds; (1) that no duty was owed to the plaintiff except to avoid wilful injury; and (2) that the act of the servant was not within the scope of his employment.\nKillam j.\u2014I agree that the evidence did not warrant the finding of the jury, that, at the time of the doing of the injury complained of, the plaintiff was occupying the premises in question by the tacit consent of the loan society.\nThe plaintiff became a tenant of the premises under the mortgagor. Default having been made, the premises were sold under the mortgage and were purchased by the Eastern Canada Savings and Loan Society? Limited. By arrangement between the mortgagor and the plaintiff, the latter was to be allowed to continue in occupation until the 28th of February following the sale. There was evidence justifying the inference that the society consented to this continuation. \"Whatever equitable rights the plaintiff may have had, the society had, at law, after the 28th of February, the right to evict him. I take it that he must be treated, as regards his legal rights, as in the position of an overholding tenant whom the landlord has, so far, taken no active steps to evict.\nThe plaintiff moved his goods from the upper stories of the building and, with his knowledge and consent, the defendant, employed by the society, put in workmen to tear down some of the internal portions of these upper stories and to make alterations therein. The defendant and his workmen knew that the plaintiff was in occupation of the lower stories and had merchandise there. In my opinion they were bound, in carrying on their work, to exercise reasonable care not to do injury to the plaintiff's goods below, and it seems unimportant, so far as regards the liability of the defendant, whether the plaintiff had or had not a right to continue in occupation or to keep his goods upon the premises. In support of this view I think it necessary to refer only to the well known case of Davies v. Mann[60], the principle of which appears to me to directly apply. Cases with regard to the duty of the owner of lands or premises to make them safe for trespassers, known or unknown, expected or unexpected, or for mere licensees, do not appear to me to have any application, and the same may be said of the case of Jones v. Foley[61]. The report of that case states explicitly that the act causing injury was done unavoidably. No question of negligence arose.\nIn my opinion, the act of the workmen which caused the injury should be considered to have been done in the course of their employment. They were employed to tear down the plaster. In doing so they obstructed the flow of water in the basin; they left it in that condition; one of them turned on the tap, either before or after the obstruction was caused, and in so leaving it obstructed, with the tap turned on, it appears to me that they were guilty of negligence for which the defendant was responsible. See Ruddiman v. Smith[62]; Abelson v. Brockman[63]; Stevens v. Woodward[64].\nWhile the persons employed by the plaintiff to examine the goods and appraise the damage estimated it at a certain amount, the jury were not absolutely bound to accept their appraisement, even without other evidence. They did have the parties before them and were entitled to judge of the value of their estimate from the oral evidence. Although that evidence did not establish any other specific sum as representing the amount of damage done, yet the jury might act upon the view that they were not satisfied that damage to a greater amount than $1,000 was done. There seems to be no sufficient ground for allowing the case to go to a new trial upon the question of damages.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed, the order for a new trial discharged and the original judgment affirmed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Henry C.

McNeil and Alexander McNeil, Executors of Alicia Cullen, Deceased.\nAppellants\nAnd\nJames Robert Mary Cullen and Leo Cullen\nRespondents\n1904: Nov. 29, 30; 1905: Jan. 31.\nPresent:\u2014Sedgewick, Girouard, Davies, Nesbitt and Killam JJ.\non appeal from the supreme court of NOVA SCOTIA.\nWill\u2014Execution\u2014Evidence\u2014Appeal.\nIn proceedings for probate of a will, the solicitor who drew it testified that it was signed by the testatrix when the subscribing witnesses were absent; that on their arrival he asked the testatrix if the signature to it was hers and if she wished the two persons present to witness it and she answered \"yes\"; each of the witnesses acknowledged his signature to the will but swore that he had not heard such question asked and answered. The Judge of Probate held that the will was not properly executed and his decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (36 N. S. Rep. 482) that two courts having pronounced against the validity of the will such decision would not be reversed by a second court of appeal. Appeal from the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the ruling of the Judge of Probate that the will in question in the case was not properly executed.\nThe facts of the case are stated as follows by Mr. Justice Townshend who delivered judgment for the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.\n\"The two principal points in opposition to the will argued before this court, and also before the court below were: (1) That the will had not been properly and legally executed by the testatrix so as to comply with the statute: (2) That in view of the circumstances under which the will was prepared and executed it cannot be taken to express the true will of the deceased.\n\"The first and all important inquiry is as to the due execution of the will. It was not signed by the testatrix in the presence of the two subscribing witnesses, but as claimed by the executor was properly acknowledged by the testatrix in their presence. The only persons present at the time were the two witnesses, Stanford and Fluck, and Alexander McNeil as well as the testatrix, in Mr. McNeil's office. The two witnesses differ so essentially in their account of what took place on this occasion from Mr. McNeil that it is necessary to extract the testimony of each in order to form a correct conclusion whether an acknowledgment as required by the statute was made. According to Mr. McNeil's testimony Stanford came first to his office door, opened it and then drew away and did not enter immediately. Then he goes on to say:\n\"Just after Mr. Stanford opened the door Mrs. Cullen got up and went over to the seat, in front of my desk, sat down there, and wrote the signature 'Alicia Cullen' which is appended to this document. After writing the signature she went back to the seat she first occupied, about six feet from the desk. Almost immediately after Mr. Stanford followed by Dr. Fluck came in. I was standing at the desk facing Mrs. Cullen with my left hand on the will when I asked Mrs. Cullen, 'is this your will and signature, and do you wish these witnesses to sign it?' To which she answered 'yes.' On looking then at the witnesses I noticed that one seemed to be urging the other to go first. They then came forward and made the signatures to this document in the order in which they appear. I then delivered the document to Mrs. Cullen and she took it away with her.\"\n\"The above extract gives exactly his account of the acknowledgment by the testatrix. Now contrast the above with the evidence of the two witnesses. First, Humphrey Stanford, after stating that he entered the office with Dr. Fluck, proceeds: 'There was nothing said. Mr. McNeil produced the document. I signed it. * * * Dr. Fluck signed it in my presence. The lady was in the room. Mr. McNeil said something about the last will and testament. I do not remember anything else.'\n\"On cross-examination he says: 'Mr. McNeil just read over about a dozen words at the last of the will. I do not know whose will it was, but had an impression it was the lady's as she was sitting there. * * I don't know whether the lady could hear Mr. McNeil reading the last few words of the will or not; I did not hear Mr. McNeil say to the lady, 'is this your will and signature, and do you wish these witnesses to sign it,' nor did I hear the lady say 'yes.' Nothing of the kind was said to my knowledge. There was no conversation whatever. If anything of the kind had been said after I entered the room I could not help hearing it. When Mr. McNeil was reading the few last words of the will I was about three feet away. * * * Mr. McNeil would be about ten feet from the lady.'\n\"Dr. Fluck says: 'To the best of my recollection I did not hear Mr. McNeil say to Mrs. Cullen, 'is this your will and signature and do you wish these witnesses to sign it.' I heard no such statement as that. If any such statement had been made while I was in the room I would have heard it. After I had said a few words to Mrs. Cullen Mr. McNeil pointed out to me where to sign. I hesitated and looked at Mr. Stanford, and then I signed. After I went back to my office I wondered if that was Mrs. Cullen's will. There was nothing said about it being the will while i was in the room. * * * I say positively that the only words uttered by Alexander McNeil while I was there were the words 'you sign here' or words to that effect. * * * If there had been any conversation between Mr. McNeil and Mrs. Cullen I would have remembered it.\"\nOn this evidence the learned judge held that the will was not properly executed and did not consider it necessary to discuss the other question.\nThis decision was affirmed by the the judgment now under appeal.\nRoss K.C. for the appellants.\nNewcombe K.C. and Henry for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nDavies J.\u2014The real question for determination in this appeal is whether the signature of the testator, Alicia Cullen, to the will in dispute was acknowledged pursuant to the statute by her in the presence of the two witnesses who signed the will as such. On proceedings taken in the Surrogate Court of Nova Scotia to prove the will in solemn form, the surrogate judge pronounced against the will on the ground, mainly, that it had not been either signed or acknowledged by the testator in the presence of the witnesses. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia upheld this finding.\nThe question for our determination is whether the evidence is so clear and strong on the point of acknowledgement as to justify us in reversing the judgments of the courts below. I am inclined to the opinion that it is not and that the evidence of what took place at the time of the execution of the will did not involve an acknowledgment by the testatrix that the signature to the will was hers.\nMr. Ross argued that the Court of Appeal in Nova Scotia had drawn a wrong inference from the proved facts, but I take it to be clear from the decided cases on the statute, that, if the testator does not sign the will in the presence of the witnesses and its proof depends upon his or her acknowledgment of a signature previously written, not in their presence, there must be some clear evidence to show the testator's acknowledgment and approbation. From the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of Blake v. Blake[2] it would appear that no acknowledgment is sufficient unless, at the time, the witnesses either saw or might have seen the testator's signature. In that case the signature was hidden by what Brett L. J. called,\nthe accident of putting a piece of blotting paper a quarter of an inch higher or lower,\nbut, while desirous of upholding the will so far as it possibly could,\nthe court had to consider an enactment of a statute in which there was no elasticity\nand, consequently, found against the will. The subsequent case of Daintree v. Butcher[3] was pressed upon us as conflicting with Blake v. Blake[4]. The distinction between the two cases is vital. In both cases, the testator's signature was written to the will before the witnesses came into the room to witness. In the former the testator's signature was not and could not be seen by the witnesses. In the latter the signature of the testator was so placed that the witnesses could have seen it when they signed their names as witnesses. The Court of Appeal, in this latter case, held that the testator had asked one of the two attesting witnesses to sign it and that it must be taken from the evidence that, after the other attesting witness had come into the room, the first one\nhad, in the presence of the testatrix, asked her, the second witness, to sign as witness.\nThis \"in the presence of the testatrix\" manifestly means from the report, in the \"presence and hearing\" of the testatrix, and, in fact, is so stated by Butt J. who first heard the case, at page 67 of the same report. In delivering the judgment of the court, Cotton L. J. says, at page 103:\nIn my opinion, when the paper bearing the signature of the testatrix was put before the two persons who were asked by her or in her presence to sign as witnesses, that was an acknowledgment of the signature by her. The signature being so placed that they could see it, whether they actually did see it or not, she was, in fact, asking them to attest that signature as hers.\nIn the case now before us, I think it is proved satisfactorily that the testatrix, Alicia Cullen, had signed the will before the witnesses came into the room or office where she was with her solicitor, and that, at the time when they entered the room she had returned to her seat some short distance away from the desk on which the will lay. It is true that neither of the witnesses could, at the hearing, positively affirm that Mrs. Cullen's signature was there at all, but I think that McNeil's evidence satisfactorily settles that point. Then, upon what facts or evidence can we hold that there was an acknowledgment of her signature? As Townshend J. in delivering the judgment of the court, says:\nBoth of them (the witnesses) swear that, even if there, the testatrix did not, in their presence, acknowledge it to be her signature, nor did they hear her answer \"yes\" to any such question, nor is there any evidence of any act or conduct on her part which could be construed as the equivalent of an acknowledgment. In fact, both witnesses say she said nothing and appeared to be perfectly indifferent to what was going on.\nIt is true that McNeil states that almost immediately after the witnesses came in he, standing at the desk and facing Mrs. Cullen, asked her whether that was her will and signature and if she wished these witnesses to sign and that she replied \"Yes.\" But, apart from the fact that they positively deny having heard anything of this, it is not sworn by McNeil himself that they did or could or must have heard it. If they never heard his question or her reply it is difficult, in the absence of other affirmative evidence, to see where there was an acknowledgment.\nAt any rate, on the facts, both courts have found against the will, and while, if the findings had been under all the surrounding circumstances the other way, I might have found it difficult, making proper allowances for lapse of time and memory, to reverse them, I cannot see, after most careful consideration, how I can, under the evidence and the findings as they are, do otherwise than express my concurrence in the judgment below and dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: H.

The circumstances of the case and the questions at issue on this appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nLovelt for the appellants.\nHenry for the respondent.\nSedgewick J. concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Killam.\nGirouard J. concurred with Mr. Justice Davies.\nDavies J.\u2014The respondent, Oliver, the plaintiff in this case, was a workman in the employ of the defendant company at the time of the injuries received by him and for which the action is brought. The action is brought under the Employers' Liability Act of Nova Scotia. The plaintiff at the trial recovered a judgment for $1,000 damages. The learned judge seemed to base his judgment on sub section c. of section 3 of the statute holding that the plaintiff was injured by the negligence of one McLean in directing a sheet of iron to be cut by plaintiff, in a dangerous place, and that\nMcLean was in the employment of the defendant company and was a person to whose orders or directions the plaintiff, at the time of the injury, was bound to conform, and did conform, and the injury sustained by the plaintiff resulted from his having so conformed to McLean's directions.\nThe learned judge went on, however, to express his doubts whether the injury was really caused by the plaintiff having conformed to the directions of McLean within the meaning of the Act as the iron could have been cut on the rail without danger if the engine and cars had not been run over the track. The learned judge expresses his further opinion that there was negligence on the part of those in charge of the train in moving the cars upon the plaintiff in the way they did, and his judgment may be said to be based, not only upon the ground already stated with doubts under sub-section c, of section 3, but also upon subsection e, the negligence of those in charge of the train by which the plaintiff was run over.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia that court drew the following conclusions from the evidence:\n(1.) That McLean was at the time of the accident a person in the service of the company whose orders or directions the plaintiff was bound to conform to, and that the injury resulted from his having so conformed.\n(2.) That the injury was due to the defect in the works or plant used in defendant company's business\u2014that is to say\u2014in the neglect or failure to provide proper plant and a reasonably safe place for cutting the sheet iron.\nIt is obvious of course that the first conclusion could not sustain the judgment because of the absence of the finding of the essential ingredient of negligence on McLean's part which caused the plaintiff's injuries. In the absence of that essential ingredient the judgment may be said to rest upon the second finding and it must be held to mean that the plaintiff's injuries were proximately and directly due to the \"defects\" referred to and to exclude negligence of the plaintiff himself as a contributory factor.\nOn appeal to this court the plaintiff relied upon all of the three grounds above referred to contending that the company was liable either because of the defects in their ways, works, plant, etc., or of the negligence of McLean to whose orders he was bound to and did conform, or of the train hands in moving the train.\nThe facts are stated by the trial judge as follows:\nPlaintiff was employed on the coal washing plant as a jigger and according to instructions given him his duty was, when the jig he worked at was idle to assist the repair men and work under their instructions. Fred. McLean, a mechanical engineer, was one of the repair men on the washing plant. His duty was to have any small repairs made that were necessary from time to time, and in doing so to control the work and to direct the men how it was to be done. On the 11th July, 1902, in the afternoon a jig on which the plaintiff was employed was not working, and it became necessary to reline with sheet iron one of the chutes connected with it.\nThe plaintiff was assisting McLean in doing this. McLean told plaintiff he was not doing right, and he marked out the shape he wanted on a piece of sheet iron and told him to cut it. The ordinary mode of cutting it was by hammer and chisel, and it was customary for the men working there to cut it on the rails of the railway track. Plaintiff took the sheet and attempted to cut it on a plank. McLean came along and said he was not cutting it right and told him to cut it on the track. Plaintiff put it on the track, and McLean said he would cut it, too, and they both sat on the track facing one another and cut the iron on the rail. There were two coal cars on the track not attached to any engine towards which plaintiff had his back a short distance away. While the plaintiff and McLean were so employed an engine with three cars backed up, coupled to the cars standing on the track and backed them on the plaintiff. Neither McLean nor the plaintiff saw or heard the cars moving until it was too late for the plaintiff to get out of the way. He was run over by the cars and one leg cut off.\nSo far as the plaintiff's injuries may be said to be due to the defects in the ways, works, premises, etc., of the defendant company, I am unable to concur in the reasoning of the court appealed from. The words of the section are:\nWhere personal injury is caused to any workman (a) by reason of any defect in the condition or arrangement of the ways, works, machinery, plant, building or premises connected with, intended for or used in the business of the employer, the workman * * * shall have the same right of compensation and remedies against the employer as if the workman had not been a workman, etc.\nThe effect of this statute is to take away from the employer the old defence of common employment. This sub-section (a) is merely an enactment or declaration of the principles of the common law.\nThe workman is placed in the same position with regard to his employer in certain enumerated circumstances as would be held by any person not in the employment but entering the defendant's property by invitation and suffering injury. But it is only in cases where the injuries are caused to the workman by reason of defects, etc., that the statute applies. Can it be reasonably held in this case that the personal injuries suffered by the plaintiff were caused by reason of the defects in the works of the defendant company, assuming that such defects existed? \"Was there that immediate and intimate connection between the alleged \"defects\" and the injuries of the plaintiff that the latter could be said to have been caused by the former? Were the injuries the direct consequence of the defects in the sense that the latter may be said to be the causa causans of the injuries? In all the other four sub-sections of the section under review it is the negligence of a specified and designated person in common employment with the injured person by reason of which the personal injuries are caused which justifies the action and prevents the company from pleading the doctrine of common employment and so escaping from liability. In this subsection (a) it is the \"defects in the ways and works etc,\" which has that effect. But to my mind it is clear that as under the other sub-sections to sustain the action the negligence must be shown to be the causa causans of the injury, so in a case under this subsection (a) the \"defect in the ways, works, plant, etc.\" relied on, must be shown to be the causa causans of the injury complained of. There must be such direct necessary and intimate connection between the \"negligence\" and the \"defect\" referred to in these subsections on the one hand, and the injuries received on the other as justifies the conclusion that the negligence or the defect as the case may be was the causa causans of the injury. The negligence or the defects specified in the section must be shown to have caused the injury not in any indirect or remote way but directly and proximately. The plaintiff, it is said, went on the railway track to cut the sheet iron because proper facilities were not otherwise provided for him to do so. But that did not of itself or directly or proximately cause his injuries. In fact there cannot be said to be any necessary immediate and intimate connection between the fact of the plaintiff resorting to the railway track to cut the sheet iron and his subsequent injuries. One was a sequence to the other, not a consequence, and there was not any intimate or necessary causal connection between them. The injuries were caused proximately by the moving train and not by any alleged defect in the plant or by the negligence of McLean and confirming to his order to cut the sheet iron on the track. If the moving train had not come along when it did neither the alleged defects in the plant nor obedience to the orders given would have caused the injuries plaintiff suffered. If plaintiff's injuries were caused directly and proximately by the moving train, as is of course the case, they can only be said under any legitimate assumption to have been indirectly and remotely caused by the alleged defect in the plant or the order to cut upon the track. The injuries were not caused as required by the statute \"by reason of the defects in the plant, etc.\", but by reason of the moving train either properly or negligently propelled and of the negligence and carelessness of the plaintiff in sitting down in the exposed and dangerous position he adopted and failing to take proper precautions against being run over. The railway track was a very dangerous place to do the work, and known by the plaintiff to be such. He knew trains were being moved along the track every few minutes and his injuries were caused by his own carelessness, if indeed it might not be called recklessness, in sitting down upon the railway track with his back to some cars standing on the track a very short distance from him and utterly neglecting to take such prudent and reasonable precautions for his safety as the circumstances I have mentioned obviously called for. Of course under the circumstances I have mentioned and the assumption I have argued the case upon, namely, the defects in the works justifying if not necessitating a resort to the track so as to cut the sheet iron, if the person in charge of the train which ran over the plaintiff had been guilty of negligence in the management of the train the action could be sustained under sub-section (e). But while the trial judge intimates an opinion that there was not sufficient care taken in moving the cars he does so upon the ground that the brakesman who was directing the operation of coupling the cars attached to the moving engine with those cars standing upon the track near to where the plaintiff was sitting should not have signalled to the engineer to go on after the coupling was completed until he had first gone to the rear end of the train from where he would have seen the plaintiff and McLean sitting on the track. I am unable to agree with the learned judge that the failure of the brakesman to do this was any evidence of negligence. He had no suspicion, of course, that any men were sitting on the track behind the end car. He had no reason whatever to expect they would be there. He acted on this occasion as he ordinarily did, getting off the cars attached to the engine and standing at the side opposite to the point where they coupled with those standing on the track, and as soon as the coupling was completed signalling in the usual way to the engine driver to back up. He could not possibly have seen the injured man unless he stooped down and looked under the cars or ran to the end of the last car to view the track before signaling to move. He was not bound, in my opinion, to do either one or the other, and bis not doing either of them is no evidence of negligence. To lay down as a standard of duty which all men engaged in directing the coupling of cars and the moving of trains would be bound to comply with, that after coupling any cars on to a train the workman, before signaling the train to move, should assure himself that the track ahead was free of people either by going to the end of the last car or in some other way, would be to go far beyond what is reasonable. The bell, it was proved, was kept continuously ringing but for some reason the warning was unheeded by the unfortunate man who was injured and who, from the manner in which he was sitting on the track with his back to the approaching train, could not see it approaching.\nThe only remaining ground to be considered is the one on which the trial judge, but with doubts, based his judgment, viz., under sub-section (c) by reason of the negligence of McLean to whose orders the plaintiff was bound to conform and did conform, and whose injuries resulted from his having so conformed. The learned judge's doubts were as to the injuries having resulted from conformity to the orders. The judges of the appeal court were silent upon this ground and I think the doubts of the trial judge well founded.\nThe case of Wild v. Waygood[1], is an instructive one as to the proper construction of this sub-section of the Employer's Liability Act. As I read and understand the judgments delivered in that case by the distinguished judges of the Court of Appeal it is essential under this section to prove negligence of the person in the service of the employer to whose orders the workman injured was bound to conform. Such negligence must be the causa causans of the injury, and it must be shewn in addition that the injury arose not alone from such negligence but also from the injured person having conformed to the order. Lord Herschell says at page 790:\nThe negligence must be proved, and if you prove the negligence, then it is sufficient if, in addition to proving that, you also prove that the injury resulted, not from the negligence alone, but from the negligence and the conforming to the order.\nLindley L.J. says, at page 793:\nThe whole, I think, comes to this: that the injury must be the result of negligence of the person giving those orders and of the plaintiff conforming to those orders.\nKay L.J. says, at page 795:\nThe injury must be caused by the negligence of that person (the one to whose orders the workman was bound to conform) and must result from the workman at the time of the injury conforming to the order.\nAnd again:\nIt relates to negligence which has an intimate connection with the conforming of the workman to an order given him at the time of the injury and to which he was conforming at the time of the injury.\nI am of the opinion under the evidence that McLean was a person in the defendant's employ to whose order at the time and under the circumstances the plaintiff was bound to conform and did conform. But I am unable to discover the negligence of McLean, and the necessary and intimate connection between the injury plaintiff received and such negligence, if any there was, and plaintiff's conformity to the order he received. I have already discussed this point and have concluded that it was the negligence or recklessness of the injured party in cutting the sheet iron at the dangerous place and in the manner and way and under the circumstances he did without taking any of those reasonable and prudent precautions he should have taken which directly caused his injuries and not any negligence of McLean whose orders he had to obey or of the man or men in charge of the engine which run over him, or any defects in the ways, works, etc., of the defendant company.\nIt was of course strenuously contended by the appellant company that the finding of the Appeal Court as to the existence of defects in their plant because of the absence of proper places for the workmen to cut this sheet iron was contrary to the evidence. In the view I took, however, of the direct and proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries and of the necessity, if there was a defect in the plant, of showing that it was the causa causans of the injury I thought it better to deal with the case as if the finding of fact on this point by the court was correct.\nUnder all the circumstances I am of opinion that the appeal must be allowed with costs.\nNesbitt J.\u2014I would allow the appeal with costs in all courts for the reasons stated by my brother Killam.\nKillam J.\u2014In my opinion no defect in the condition or arrangement of the ways, works, etc., of the company was proved. The steel plates could be cut upon any hard substance conveniently situated for the purpose. There was no necessity for keeping such substances scattered about so that they would always be near at hand wherever the cutting might be required to be done.\nI am also of opinion that there was no negligence in the running of the railway cars or in the matter of proper precautions on the part of those moving them. The railway tracks were not provided for use in cutting plates. While some of the men may have seen fit to use them for such a purpose they did so at their own risk, and the train employees were not called upon to be on the look out for those who might happen to be on the tracks for that or any other purpose. They did not see the plaintiff or know of his presence on the track.\nI agree, however, that McLean was a person in the company's employ to whose orders, at the time and under the circumstances, the plaintiff was bound to conform, and that, in using the railway tracks as he was, the plaintiff was conforming to McLean's orders. But I concur with my brother Davies in thinking that the plaintiff was bound to use reasonable precautions for his own safety in what he knew to be a dangerous situation and that his injuries substantially resulted from his failure to do so. In that view he cannot recover.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W. H. Covert.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J. A. McDonald.\n[1] [1892] 1 Q. B. 783.\n",

S. N. S. (1900) ch. 160, do not permit the reception of a certified copy of a copy of a plan of survey deposited in the Crown Lands Office to make proof of the original annexed to the grant of lands from the Crown. Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, setting aside the judgment entered at the trial on a verdict for the defendants and ordering a new trial.\nThe action was by the respondent claiming from the appellants the value of certain iron ore alleged to have been mined on the area covered by a lease to him from the Government of Nova Scotia, in 1889. The case was tried, for the second time, before Mr. Justice Meagher, with a jury, and questions were submitted to the jury, which they answered in favour of the defendants. Upon these findings judgment was entered for the defendants, but on motion on behalf of the plaintiff the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ordered a new trial. The defendants now appeal.\nThe plaintiff claimed (1) the value of iron ore which the defendants purchased from the Pictou Charcoal Iron Co., paying them for the same, and (2) the value of other iron ore mined by the New Glasgow Iron, Coal and Railway Co. The defendants' contention with reference to the first part of the plaintiff's claim was that, although some of the ore was mined within the limits of the plaintiff's lease, this lease covered a part of the property included in a grant made to one Peter Grant and others, dated 3rd November, 1785, in which the ores were not reserved to the Crown, and that the ore in question was so mined by the Pictou Charcoal Iron Company, upon the Peter Grant property under agreement or lease from the present owners of that property. \"With regard to the second part of the plaintiff's claim, it was common ground that the plaintiff's lease covered land granted to one Finlay Cameron, one of the grantees in the said grant dated 3rd November, 1785, and the defendants' contention was that the ore in question was mined on this Finlay Cameron lot, and that it was so mined under agreement or lease from the present owners of that lot. As regards both parts of the plaintiff's claim it was common ground that if the ore was mined within the limits of the lands granted to Peter Grant and Finlay Cameron in 1785, the plaintiff must fail. Both contentions of the defendants were denied by the plaintiff and the main issues at the trial were as to the exact location, on the ground, of the Peter Grant property and of the Finlay Cameron lot. Although the grant in question refers to a plan as being annexed to it, neither the original grant nor the counterpart at the Crown Lands Office have now any plan annexed.\nIn stating the reasons for the judgment appealed from, Mr. Justice Townshend, after making reference to certain hearsay evidence as improperly admitted, proceeds as follows:\n\"While in my opinion such evidence could not properly be received in this case, still more objectionable was the reception of certain plans, or copies of plans, found in the Crown Land Office, which, without doubt, must have carried great weight with the jury. The first of these plans is these marked 'W. W. F.' There was no plan attached to the grant under which Peter Grant and others got their title from the Crown. The grant says: 'and has such shape, form and marks, as appears by a plan thereof hereunto annexed.' * * * The last revision of the statutes (E. S. N. S. (1900) ch. 163, sec. 20), provides: '(1) A copy of any duplicate original of a grant from the Crown deposited in the Department of Crown Lands, certified by the Commissioner of Crown Lands, or a copy of any grant from the books of registry for any registration district in which the land granted is situated, certified under the hand of the registrar of deeds, shall be received in evidence in any court to the same extent as the original grant.' '(2). If any such duplicate original contains any reference to any plan, and there is on file in such department a plan corresponding to the description, or meeting the requirements of the said duplicate original, such plan shall be deemed to be the plan referred to in such duplicate original notwithstanding the same is not annexed to such duplicate original.' * * * It will be observed that the plan produced in evidence 'W. W. F.' was a certified copy of a plan shown to witness by Mr. Austin, in the Crown Land Office, and not the plan on file in the office. Objection was at once made that the statute did not make a certified copy evidence, and it is evident that it does not, and the objection was sound.\"\nThe questions at issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgment now reported.\nNew combe K.C. and Henry for the appellants.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSedgewick J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nWhen this case was on appeal before us, after the first decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], we held, (26th Feb., 1903), affirming the judgment of that court that the area described in the mining lease under which the plaintiff claims was clearly defined and ascertained, and that all reference in the description therein to the southern line of Peter Grant's lot might be eliminated as falsa demonstratio.\nNow, it was clearly proved at the second trial that most, if not all, of the workings, whether old or new, complained of were within that ascertained area, and it follows, therefore, in my view, that the plaintiff made out a prima facie case, having put in his lease from the Crown, and having proved a trespass or conversion by the defendants or those under whom they claim, upon any lands or goods within its boundaries. But the defendants claiming under the successors in title of Peter Grant, whose patent gave him a title to all minerals (the royal metals, of course, accepted), had a right to prove that, notwithstanding the lease from the Crown of the minerals below the surface, the Peter Grant lot overlapped that tract and that the ore taken out was taken out wholly within the limits of of the Peter Grant patent. This for the most part they established by sufficient evidence but they did not do it in toto.\nThe principal evidence that was given to shew the true location of the southern line of the Peter Grant lot was that of the surveyor Holmes, who, although at the first trial he had placed it as co-terminous with the boundary of the mining lease, at the second trial admitted that it was several chains south of that line. No witness gave any evidence to shew that the true line was further south than where Holmes, at the last trial placed it. The defendant company were, therefore, held to have been within their rights in respect to all ore mined north of the line so proved by Holmes, but there was evidence, and so far as I can make out, undisputed evidence, that the new workings, as they are called, from which ore was taken and which came into the hands of the defendant company, were south of the Holmes line.\nAlexander McDonald, who was the director and secretary of the company, testifies that there were twelve hundred tons taken out of the new shaft, (otherwise spoken of as the new workings), in the year 1900. Now, if the new shaft was south of the only southern line of the Peter Grant lot, then the plaintiff must succeed, and a verdict for the defendants must be held to be contrary to the evidence, and the order for a new trial was consequently right.\nI do not think it necessary to express any opinion as to the view which Mr. Justice Townshend took as to the improper receipt of alleged hearsay evidence, but I think he was right in his view as to the reception of the copy of the plan alleged to be a copy of the plan attached to the original grant.\nIf the plan itself had been produced and proved by a competent officer to be an original on file in the Crown Lands Office, it would, at common law as well as under the statute of 1900, have been evidence. Having probably been made by the officers of the Crown Lands Department about a century before the plaintiff's lease, it was certainly evidence against the Crown, not conclusive evidence, but evidence, as an admission by the Crown of the character of the country evidently surveyed by its officers and granted to settlers. And, if it is evidence against the Crown, it is likewise evidence against all persons claiming under the Crown subsequently to its coming into existence.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W. A. Henry.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H. C. Borden.\n[1] 35 N. S. Rep. 376.\n",

Keighley, Maxtead & Co. v. Durant ([1901] A. C. 240) followed.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe facts of the case are stated by the trial judge in his judgment as follows:\n\"The plaintiff, H. E. Moore, was in partnership with one Robertson, and the firm sold part of the goods for which the action is brought and the other part Moore sold to the defendant after the dissolution when Moore took an assignment of Robertson's interest in the assets. On the 19th of January, 1897, H. E. Moore assigned for the benefit of creditors of W. A. Moore and one Moffat. On the same date W. H. Moore recovered judgment against H. E. Moore for upward of $15,000 and an execution was forthwith issued and placed in the sheriff's hands. Apparently the assignment was afterwards treated as void for under the execution a levy upon and sale were made of the goods of H. E. Moore. The books of account and book debts due to H. E. Moore were levied upon under the execution and a sale of the same took place on the 22nd April, 1897. The execution was returned satisfied for the amount realized from the goods, book debts, etc. Before this sale, namely, on the 22nd February, 1897, W. H. Moore himself had assigned for the benefit of creditors to one Treen and Treen, at the sheriff's sale, as such trustee bid in these books and book debts, which included the claim against the defendant. He took possession of the books, notified debtors, and for several months, indeed until the 22nd June, 1898, he was collecting under the supervision of H. E. Moore these debts. On that date Treen re-conveyed back to W. H. Moore, who had compounded with his creditors. On the 24th October, 1898, a decree was made at the suit of a creditor of H. E. Moore setting aside as contrary to the Statute of Elizabeth, the assignment made by H. E. Moore. Apparently it contained some of the clauses condemned by the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\"Recently an action has been brought to recover the claim against the defendant and every person who has any possible interest has been joined as plaintiff. The Statute of Limitations is pleaded and the plaintiffs are obliged to rely upon an acknowledgment in writing and a payment made during the period when Treen, trustee of W. H. Moore, was believed to be the owner of the chose in action. The payment was made by a shipment of fish to be sold and the proceeds credited on account of the debt. H. E. Moore was concerned in conducting the business and he was cognizant of the collection and its payment. The amount was credited in the original account in the book of H. E. Moore. The defendant in evidence says: 'After that I shipped the fish to Mr. William Ross for Mr. H. E. Moore in payment of the claim he had against me.' He had already received from Treen, as trustee, a statement of the account and a notification and his letter advising of the shipment of the fish was addressed to Treen.\"\nThe learned judge held that this transaction was capable of being, and was ratified by H. E. Moore and took the case out of the statute. He gave judgment for the plaintiffs for the sum claimed which judgment was reversed by the full court.\nNew combe K.C. for the appellants. The decision of the learned trial judge was right. The assignment having been for the benefit of creditors solely, and having been set aside as void as against creditors, is completely out of the way. Such assignments stand on a different footing from others which stand good inter parties. If the assignment be regarded as out of the way and the payment be regarded as having been made to Treen or to H. E. Moore, it was properly made; Treen and H. E. Moore were, it is submitted, in privity. Again, there has been ratification. The payment made has been adopted and is credited in the statement of claim herein. See Warren on Choses in Action, pp. 64, 78, 79 and 82.\nIf the assignment is out of the way and book debts cannot be seized and sold by the sheriff and if seized and sold such action cannot be ratified, then appellant H. E. Moore would be the creditor to whom the respondent in his evidence testified he made the payment through Ross, and the debt could be garnished by creditors. If the assignment be good and the book debts not leviable by the sheriff, even in this case H. E. Moore would be cestui que trust, and a payment made to him can be taken advantage of by the assignees to bar the Statute of Limitations. Megginson v. Harper[1]. Darby & Bosanquet on Limitations of Actions (2 ed.) 114, 115, 116.\nBoth of the exceptions referred to in the case of Stamford Spalding and Boston Banking Co. v. Smith[2], occur here:\u20141. A payment to a person erroneously believed to fill a representative capacity which payment will enure to the benefit of the person entitled to receive payment. 2. A mistake made by both parties, which mistake will not prevent the payment having the effect it was intended to have.\nIn support of the exceptions referred to in Stamford Spaulding and Boston Banking Co. v. Smith (2) we refer to Wood on Limitations of Actions, p. 231: Hart v. Stephens[3]; Trulock v. Robey[4]; McAuliffe v. Filzsimons[5]; Clark v. Hooper[6]; Lyell v. Kennedy[7]; Worlhington v. Grimsditch[8]; Hewett on Statutes of Limitations, p. 32, s. 8.\nTreen was, by implication of law, agent for the assignee of H. E. Moore and a payment made to him either in error as to his capacity or otherwise enured to the assignee's benefit. Freeman on Executions, p. 262. A fortiori the debtor or his assignee could recover the amounts by suit unless ratification of payment was permissible and exercised.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondent. In order to take the case out of the Statute of Limitations, the payment must be made to the creditor or his agent The respondent never understood that Treen was in any sense the agent of H. E. Moore; Stamford Spalding and Boston Banking Co. v. Smith (2). See also Keighly, Maxted & Co. v. Durant[9]; Fraser v. Sweet[10]. The sheriff in selling under an execution does not act as agent of the judgment creditor, much less of the judgment debtor; he acts for himself, executing the law. Wilson v. Tumman[11]. H. E. Moore could not ratify the sale, having assigned all his book debts for the benefit of his creditors before the sale took place. There can be no ratification without full knowledge. It does not appear that H. E. Moore had notice or knowledge of the invalidity of the sheriff's sale and he no doubt supposed it valid. He cannot be said to have acquiesced in the sale, because, not knowing it was invalid, he took no steps to question it. Leake on Contracts, (4 ed.) page 311; Lewis v. Read[12]; La Banque Jacques Carlier v. La Banque D'Epargne, &c. de Montreal[13]; Marsh v. Joseph[14] at page 246. Mere failure to give notice of invalidity is not acquiescence or ratification. \"We also refer to Boultbee v. Burke[15]; Tanner v. Smart[16]; Grenfell v. Girdle-stone[17] at p. 676; Howcutt v. Bonser[18].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nKillam J.\u2014We are all of opinion that the judgment in this case should be affirmed on the ground stated by Townshend J., to which I will add but a few words upon one or two points raised before us.\nIt has been suggested that there was an equitable assignment by H. E. Moore to Treen. It does not appear to me that there were either words or acts amounting to such an assignment. Moore did nothing more than stand by and allow the sheriff's vendee to collect the debts, probably supposing that the sheriff's sale was good. While he might possibly have been estopped from denying the validity of a payment to Treen, he cannot adopt it so as to give himself a right of action under it.\nTreen did not assume to act as the agent of Moore, and therefore, upon the principle laid down in Keighley, Maxsted & Co. v. Durant[19], Moore could not make the transaction his own by ratification.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: R. F.

All the various parts of the mill were placed in position, either resting by their own weight on the soil or steadied by bolts, and the whole installation could be removed without injury to the freehold.\nHeld, that the mill was a chattel or, at any rate, a trade fixture removable by the licensees during the tenure of their lease or license and, consequently, it was subject to seizure and sale under an execution against goods.\nJudgment appealed from (36 N. S. Rep. 395) affirmed, but for different reasons.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment at the trial dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe case is stated in the judgment of the court as delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Davies.\nRoss K.C. and Lovett for the appellants. Henry for the respondent, Bishop.\nMellish K. Co for the respondents, the Albion Lumber Company.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nDavies J.\u2014The substantial question argued upon this appeal and on the determination of which the appeal must either be allowed or dismissed is whether a \"five stamp gold mining mill\" with boiler and all necessary machinery, erected by the appellant company on the waste lands of the Crown in Nova Scotia under a mining license given to it by the Commissioner of Mines, could be sold by the sheriff under an execution against the appellant company authorizing and directing a sale of its goods and chattels. The determination of this question depends upon the other questions whether the mill had been so annexed to the soil as to have been part of the land or whether it was a trade fixture capable of being removed by the appellant company as the tenant or licensee of the mining area during the term of its lease or license. Many questions were raised at the trial and before the Appeal Court in Nova Scotia but they were all with the exception of those above referred to either practically abandoned before this court or disposed of at the argument.\nThe learned trial judge held that, as a matter of fact, no parts of the mill were fixtures in the soil so as to have become and form part of the land, and in that finding I concur.\nAll the various parts of the mill were either resting by their own weight on the land or were only bolted down and all could be removed by unscrewing the bolts and lifting the parts out of their places. The only part to which it was contended this did not strictly apply was the boiler, but the facts shew that the land was wilderness and that no injury could possibly be done to it by removing the boiler. The mill was only erected for testing purposes and the degree and object of the slight annexation which was apparent convinces me that it never was the intention of the parties to make it a fixture or part of the land.\nThe authorities all seem to show that it is not solely the fact of the chattels being annexed to the soil which determines whether or not they have become part of the soil but that the object and purpose and intention of their annexation must be looked to.\nIn Hellawell v. Eastwood[2], a question arose as to whether certain machinery used for manufacturing purposes was attached to the freehold so as to be exempt from distress. The court held they had not become part of the freehold and in delivering the judgment of the court Parke B. said,\nthey were slightly attached so as to be capable of removal without the least injury to the frame of the building or to themselves; and the object and purpose of their annexation was not to improve the inheritance but merely to render the machines steadier and mere capable of convenient use as chattel.\nSee also Huntley v. Russell[3]; and Waterfall v. Penistone[4], in which case the court acted upon the rule laid down in Hellawell v. Eastwood (1). It seems to me that every word of that rule is applicable to the erection of this temporary machinery for mining purposes on the waste lands of the Crown. It was erected for testing purposes; it was only slightly attached to the land, in fact the only part of it which could be said to be even so slightly attached or affixed was the boiler; and it was not even attempted to be argued that it was so attached with the object and purpose of improving the inheritance. All of the machinery was capable of being removed without any injury to the soil. The object and purpose and intention of its erection was the testing of the areas for minerals tentatively and temporarily. In Holland v. Hodgson[5], at p. 335, Blackburn J. in delivering the considered judgment of the court stated the rule deducible from the cases to be that\nan article which is affixed to the land, even slightly, is to be considered as part of the land unless the circumstances are such as to show that it was intended all along to continue a chattel, the onus lying on those who contend that it is a chattel.\nIn the case at bar the circumstances convince me beyond reasonable doubt that it was intended this machinery should all along continue as a chattel and not be part of the Crown's wild land.\nThe case of Wake v. Hall[6], is one relating to mines and buildings and machinery erected for mining purposes and affixed to the soil, and to the right of the miner to pull down and remove them from the soil even though annexed. Though that decision depended largely upon custom and statute, the observations of the several law Lords on the broad general question raised in this appeal are most pertinent. Lord Blackburn, at pages 204-5 says:\nWhenever the chattels have been annexed to the land for the purpose of the better enjoying the land itself, the intention must clearly be presumed to be to annex the property in the chattels to the property in the land, but the nature of the annexation may be such as to show that the intention was to annex them only temporarily; and there are cases deciding that some chattels so annexed to the land as to be, whilst not severed from it, part of the land, are removable by the executor as between him arid the heir. Lord Ellenborough, in Elwes v. Maw[7], says that those cases \"may be considered mainly on the ground that where the fixed instrument, engine, or utensil (and the building covering the same falls within the same principle) was an accessory to a matter of a personal nature, that it should be itself considered as personalty.\" Even in such a case the degree and nature of the annexation is an important element for consideration; for where a chattel is so annexed that it cannot be removed without great damage to the land, it affords a strong ground for thinking that it was intended to be annexed in perpetuity to the land: and as Lord Hardwicke said, in Lawton v. Lawton[8], \"you shall not destroy the principal thing by taking away the accessory to it,\" and, therefore, as I think, even if the property in the chattel was not intended to be attached to the property in the land, the amount of damage that would be done to the land by removing it may be so great as to prevent the removal. But in the case now before the House there can be no doubt on the admissions that the machinery and the buildings were from the first intended to be accessory to the mining, and that there was not at any time an intention to make them accessory to the soil; and though the foundations being, as is stated in the 12th and 13th admissions, below the natural surface, they cannot be removed without some disturbance to the soil, it is, I think, impossible to hold that the amount of this disturbance is so great as to amount to the destruction of the land, or to show that the property in the materials must have been intended to be irrevocably annexed to the soil.\nLord Bramwell says at page 209:\nBut if no reason can be given why the maxim (quicquid solo plantatur solo cedit) should apply to this case, plenty of reason can be given why it should not. The defendants are lawfully in possession of the premises. They or their predecessors lawfully built these buildings which are essential to the working of the mine, being accessorial to the engine and works; and it would be most unreasonable that they should have to leave them on the premises\u2014as unreasonable as that they should leave the engine. On this ground alone I should advise your lordships to affirm the judgment.\nSimilar reasons and observations are to be found in the judgments delivered by Lord Watson and Lord Fitzgerald, and every word of them is applicable to the case before us.\nThere is this peculiarity in this case which, so far as my research has extended, cannot be found in any other case, that the Crown is not as a patty to these proceedings and has never contended that the engine and machinery had become annexed to its land and had ceased to be chattels of the appellant company. It is the latter company itself which puts forward the plea and bases an application upon it for a declaration that the sheriff's sale under the execution against it was as regards this machinery void, and the purchaser, who by the way had not removed the machinery, a trespasser. If the rule laid down by Lord Ellenborough in the leading case of Elwes v. Maw[9], at page 105 is followed that\nwhere the fixed instrument, engine or utensil (and the buildings covering the same falls within the same principle) was an accessory to a matter of a personal nature it should be itself considered as personalty\nthere would be, in my judgment, small room for doubt in this case. That rule is only another way of stating the proposition submitted by Baron Parke in Hellawell v. Eastwell,[10] that \"it is the object, purpose and intention of the annexation which is to be considered,\" and if these are not to improve the inheritance but if the chattels are annexed as an accessory to a matter of a personal nature such as rendering the machinery steadier and more capable of more convenient use as chattels they will still, notwithstanding the slight annexation, continue their character as chattels. Now who can doubt but that such slight annexation as there was in this case capable of severance without detriment to the soil had for its object the personal one of testing the area licensed to the appellant company for minerals and as accessory to the mining the company carried on? Personally I should not consider it open to argument that the object was not the improvement and enrichment of the lands of the Crown. No such argument was addressed to us, the counsel being content to take it for granted, as the court of appeal had found, that the slight annexation had worked the transformation from chattels to land.\nI do not think, however, it is necessary to rest my decision upon that ground because even assuming the mill and machinery to have become fixtures I am still clearly of opinion that they were within the category of trade fixtures which as between the appellant company and the Crown the former had a right to remove during the existence of the tenancy or holding\nThe appeal court of Nova Scotia held that the mill was real estate and that the sheriff under an execution directing the sale of personal property could not sell it nor give any title to the purchaser. But they at the same time held that this present equitable action could not be maintained because it was unnecessary and if the purchaser attempted to exercise his assumed rights as such an action at law could be maintained against him for damages, and, on a proper case being made out, an injunction granted restraining the purchaser from interfering with the mill On these grounds they dismissed the appeal.\nTo understand properly the respective rights and liabilities of the parties it becomes necessary to ascertain the facts, and the main and important question is: In what relation did the appellant stand towards the Crown? If in the relation of tenant or any analogous relation such as mining licensee there does not seem to be any reasonable room for doubt that the mill was a trade fixture which the appellant company had a right to remove, and if that be so it seems under the authorities reasonably clear that it might be seized and removed under a writ of fieri facias or other similar process. See the authorities as collected in Amos & Ferrard on Fixtures, pp. 393-4, and in 13 Am. & E. Enc. p. 676. Then what relation did the appellant company occupy towards the Crown? The clerk of the mines office of Nova Scotia in giving his evidence says:\nThe mill is on areas 922 and 923, block 5, Millers Lake, * * * The plaintiffs have prospecting licenses for the areas referred to dated January 13th, 1902, for one year.\nUnder these licenses the appellants were not only entitled to enter upon these areas for the purpose of prospecting, but by section 159 of the Mines Act were entitled to a lease of such areas. Such lease if granted would be for forty years at an annual rental of fifty cents per area per annum\u2014see sections 171 and 181 as amended. The appellants had put in an application to the Commissioner of Crown Lands for a lease of the surface which had been approved and they thereby became tenants at will. The appellants contended that this was a mistake and that the application was really for a grant and not a lease. But even if this was so their position as vendees in possession of the land before the passing of the grant would be that of tenants at will. Woodfall, Landlord & Tenant, 17 ed. p. 258; Doe d. Stanway v. Rock[11].\nIn his judgment in the case of Wake v. Hall[12] at p. 207, Lord Watson, in referring to the three classes of cases mentioned by Lord Ellenborough in his judgment in Elwes v. Maw[13] of which that of Landlord & Tenant was one, says:\nI assume that the doctrine would receive a similar application in cases analogous to these.\nIf the appellant company could be held to be not a tenant of any kind but a licensee simply and only, its position must in reason with respect to this machinery as between it and the Crown be the same as if it was a lessee. The erections were not made in bad faith and without a title in the lands of another in which case they would become part of such lands but were made with their own materials and money as licensees from the Crown on the latter's waste lands and as necessary to test and carry on the very operations the lands were given into their possession for. The stamp mill in dispute having been erected by the company under these circumstances on these lands for testing purposes was, in my opinion, a trade fixture removable by them during the tenure of their lease or license and perhaps within a reasonable time afterwards, and consequently while so removable subject to seizure and sale under the execution issued.\nThe authorities do not seem to leave this proposition in any doubt. Mather on Sheriff law, 1894, pp. 249-257, especially on page 252 where, after reviewing the authorities the writer says\nbat now it is clear that all fixtures of whatever nature over which the person proceeded against has a right may be taken\nand seized by the sheriff under writ of fi. fa. or other similar process.\nOnce it is conceded that the relation in which the company appellant stood towards the Crown with reference to this stamp-mill was that of a tenant towards his landlord or any analogous position which justified him in erecting his mill for purposes of a personal nature, such as mining or testing for minerals, then his right to remove the fixtures as being trade fixtures seems clear, and falling within the principle of being \"an accessory to a matter of a personal nature\" must be considered as personalty and not as an interest in land. The stamp-mill in this case was an accessory to the carrying on of mining or testing for minerals on the land and was a matter of a personal nature, mining, within the definition given by Lord Ellenborough. The tenant has an interest as well as a power. Poole's Case[14]; Minshall v. Lloyd[15]; Saint v. Pilley[16].\nIn Place v. Fagg[17], Bayley J., speaking for the court, says:\nFixtures which, the tenant has a right to remove may be treated as chattels in a proceeding against the tenant.\nThe cases of Hallen v. Runder[18], and Lee v. Gaskell[19], shew that an agreement for the sale of such an interest as the tenant possesses in fixtures which he has the right to remove is not an agreement for the sale of an interest in land under the 4th section of the Statute of Frauds.\nIt is stated in Barnard v. Leigh[20], that the sheriff must separate and sell fixtures, over which he has a right of severance, apart from the leasehold if he cannot sell them together. And while that may be so, I cannot see why, under circumstances such as we have in this appeal, if the sheriff can sever the trade fixtures from the land and sell them, he cannot sell to a purchaser under his writ and confer upon him the same power of severance. On principle I cannot see why this should not be done and, in the absence of any express authority to the contrary, I am of the opinion that it can, and that a purchaser from a sheriff under such a writ, purchases as well the article which the tenant has the right to sever and remove as the right itself which the sheriff by virtue of his writ possesses.\nThe only other point pressed in argument was the alleged irregularity of the sale of the fixtures and other chattels en bloc. But whether or not by reason of such a sale an inadequate price was obtained, or whether or not as between the sheriff and the defendant (the now appellant) there was a wrong done the latter for which the former would be liable for damages, cannot arise in this appeal. The respondent, the execution creditor, in no way personally interfered in the execution of his duty by the sheriff and is not responsible even on the assumption (which I only adopt for the sake of argument) that a wrong was done by him to the execution debtor in the manner of the sale. The appellant company has waived any claim it might have against the sheriff and neither the execution creditor, who did not interfere, nor the purchaser at the sale are responsible for the sheriff's wrong doing, if any.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: H.

J.\u2014In the case of the Springdale School District, as the whole cause of action arose in the North-West Territories* the Court of King's Bench fur Manitoba had no jurisdiction to entertain the action or to render the judgment appealed from in that case and such want of jurisdiction could not be waived.\nAPPEALS from the judgments rendered by the Court of King's Bench for Manitoba, in three cases consolidated for hearing by way of appeal, ([1]) affirming the judgments of the trial judge by which the actions of the plaintiffs, the Municipality of North Cypress and the Municipality of Argyle, were respectively dismissed, and reversing the judgment of the said trial judge by which the action of the said plaintiff, the Springdale School District, had also been dismissed and ordering in the latter case that judgment should be entered therein in favour of the said plaintiff for $125 with costs of suit on the King's Bench scale but allowing no costs of the appeals taken in any of said consolidated cases.\nThe actions were instituted for the purpose of determining the time of the commencement of the twenty years' exemption of the company's land grant from taxation under clause 16 of the contract for the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, entered into between the Government and the company on 21st October, 1880, and ratified by the Act 41 Vict., ch. 1, (D.) assented to on the 15th February, 1881, and the determination of the powers of taxation affecting the land subsidy in aid of the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Three separate suits, in the Court of King's Bench for Manitoba, were brought for the recovery of taxes upon portions of the land grant of the railway company, in which the two municipal corporations in Manitoba and the school district above mentioned were plaintiffs, the Canadian Pacific Rail\u00ab way Company being defendants in all the cases. The jurisdiction of the court over the case from the NorthWest Territories was not objected to. The questions of law and fact in dispute were almost identical in each case, and formal judgments were entered for the defendants. The cases were then taken, by way of appeal, to the full court, where, by the consent of all parties, the three suits were consolidated.\nThe municipality of North Cypress is situated in Manitoba wholly within the main line belt provided for in section 11 of the contract for the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the municipality of Argyle is also situated in Manitoba entirely outside of this main line belt but within a reservation set apart by the Dominion Government by order in council dated 3rd November, 1882, for the purposes of the contract. Both municipalities are in the territory which, at the time of the contract, formed a part of the North-West Territories and which was added to Manitoba in 1881, shortly after the contract, by the joint legislation of the Dominion and Manitoba (1) and became a part of Manitoba, by proclamation, on the first day of July, 1881. The Springdale School District is situated in the North-West Territories and is within the said main line belt.\nThe principal issues upon the present appeals were whether or not certain of the subsidy lands granted to the company, within twenty years of the institution of the actions, had become liable to assessment and taxation by the corporations within the limits of which they were respectively situated, by reason of the expiration of twenty years from the date of the contract for the construction of the railway, or by reason of the expiration of the period of twenty years from the time of the selection and setting apart of certain unpatented lands as part of such land subsidy earned by the company under the said contract and to whit h they were then entitled to a grant by letters patent from the Crown.\nThe railway company contended that all the lands were exempt from assessment and taxation for twenty years from the actual date of the issue of letters patent of grant from the Crown, under the sixteenth clause of the above mentioned contract, which is as follows:\u2014 \u201c 16. The Canadian Pacific Railway and all stations and station grounds, workshops, buildings, yards and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances required and used for the construction and working thereof, and the capital stock of the company, shall be forever free from taxation by the Dominion or by any province hereafter to be established or by any municipal corporation therein, and the lands of the company in the North-West Territories until they are either sold or occupied shall also be free from such taxation for twenty years after the grant thereof from the Crown. \u201d\nIn respect to the lands situated in Cypress and Argyle, those municipalities being part of the territory added to Manitoba after the ratification of the contract, the company also claimed exemption under the joint legislation in 1881, 44 Vict., 3rd sess., ch. 1, (Man.), which provided that such \u201c increased limits shall be subject to all such provisions as Parliament has enacted or may hereafter enact respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway and the lands to be granted in aid thereof; \u201d and the Act 44 Vict., ch. 14 (D.), assented to 21st March, 1881, extending the boundaries of Manitoba by the addition of territory which had, until then, been part of the North-West Territories, upon the terms and conditions mentioned in 44 Vict., ch. 1, 3rd sess., (Man.), and the Act 44 Vict., ch. 6, 3rd sess., (Man.), assented to on the 25th May, 1881, and brought into force by proclamation 1st July, 1881, enacting that the boundaries of the province should be extended as provided by the Dominion Act and subject to the terms and conditions therein contained, and that the said Act and all the enactments thereof should have the force and effect of law in Manitoba so increased as aforesaid.\nThe plaintiff municipalities contended that, even if the position taken by the railway company was sound, the exemption did not cover the taxation by Manitoba, a province established before the contract was made.\nThe material questions raised upon this appeal are stated in the judgments now reported\n[Page 555].\nHowell K. C., and Riddell K. C. for the appellants, the Rural Municipalities of North Cypress and Argyle and for the respondent, the Springdale School District.\nC. Robinson K. C., Ewart K.C., Creelman K.C. and Phippen for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, respondents and appellants.\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014In the Springdale case the appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed without costs. The action should have been dismissed in limine by the original court ex proprio molu for want of jurisdiction. It is an action by which the Manitoba courts are asked to declare that a lot of land situate in the North-West Territories, outside of the territorial limits of the said courts, is and will be in the future subject to taxation for school purposes under the laws of the North-West Territories. That is the first and fundamental conclusion of the action. It might as well have been brought at Hong Kong. And the jurisdictional objection could not be waived. The action cannot be treated as a mere personal one for debt. The judgment for $125 (the amount claimed was $27) necessarily implies that the land in question is, and will be until sold, liable to taxation. That is why, probably, the costs on the King's Bench scale are granted. The controversy between the parties is not at all as to the amount claimed, but as to the liabilty or non-liability of this land to taxation.\nIn the other two cases I agree that the appeals should be dismissed. I would have done so at the hearing without calling on the respondents. The appellants\u055d contentions are untenable. I do not see that I can usefully add anything to the cogent reasoning of the Chief Justice for Manitoba. I would say, no costs to either party as in the court below. SEDGEWICK J.\u2014I agree in the reasoning of my brother Davies.\nGIROU ARD J.\u2014I think the Canadian Pacific Railway Company has a right to judgment in its favour in the three cases. Without referring to all the statutes and orders in council which have been cited at bar and commented upon during five days, I propose to base my opinion upon clause 16 of the contract, sanctioned by the Parliament of Canada, and the statutes which provide for the extension of the boundaries of Manitoba and the constitution of the territories in force at the time of the passing of the contract.\nClause 16 of the contract declares:\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway and all stations and station grounds, workshops, buildings, yards and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances required and used for the construction and working thereof and the capital stock of the company shall be forever free from taxation by the Dominion, or by any province hereafter to be established or by any municipal corporation therein; and the lands of the company in the North-West Territories, until they are either sold or occupied, shall also be free from such taxation for twenty y ears after the grant thereof from the Crown.\nThe courts below held that the taxes, demanded by the plaintiffs, whether school or municipal, were \u201c taxation \u201d by a \u201c municipal corporation \u201d within the meaning of the above clause and since our decision in The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. The City of Winnipeg ([2]), I submit that the soundness of this conclusion is not open to any doubt.\nA great deal of stress has been laid upon the expressions in clause 16 \u201c by any municipal corporation therein. \u201d It is contended that they mean that the exemption from taxation applies only to corporations established in any new province organized in the territories. If this contention be well founded, it does seem clear that the Manitoba municipalities at least cannot dispute the right of exemption; for a municipal corporation situated in the extended territory of Manitoba is exactly in the same position as a municipal corporation in a newly organized province in the territories. But is that the true meaning of the first part of clause 16? Did Parliament intend to give less power to a new province than to the provisional government? It cannot be so. It seems to me that the reference to any future province or \u201c any municipal corporation therein \u201d was hardly necessary, as the right of exemption was clearly secured by the words \u201c shall be forever free from taxation by the Dominion \u201d This provision comprises first exemption from any tax imposed upon the property therein described directly by the Parliament of Canada, whether in the Territories or in the old provinces, for by the B. N. A. Act, s. 91, par. 3, the Parliament of Canada may resort to direct taxation upon lands or other property throughout the whole Dominion, although it has not done so yet. It means a forliori that in the Territories owned and controlled by the Dominion, no tax of any kind whatever can be exacted from the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. by the Dominion Parliament or any local government organized or to be organized by that Parliament, whether provisional or provincial, or by any municipal corporation therein, for what the Dominion cannot do directly cannot be done indirectly by any delegated authority. The latter part of clause 16, however, removes in my mind any possible doubt in the matter,\nand the lands of the company in the North-West Territories * * shall also be free from such taxation, etc.\n\u201c Such taxation \u201d must mean any kind of taxes imposed by the Dominion or its delegated authority upon the land grants in the North-West Territories. The courts below held that by clause 16 the Parilament of Canada did not intend to make a statutory grant in pr\u0153senti, but only a Crown grant by patent in futuro. The decision of this court in The Rural Municipality of Cornwallis v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. ([3]), and also the recent judgment of the Privy Council in the Swamp Lands Case ([4]) of Manitoba confirming the judgment of this court ([5])\u2014a much stronger case than the present one)\u2014fully support this contention.\nThe Parliament of Canada, having first sanctioned the above contract, subsequently, on the petition of the Legislature of Manitoba, enlarged the Province of Manitoba by the addition of a large territory which until then had been part of the North-West Territories; but in face of the limitation expressly assented to by the Legislature of Manitoba, it cannot seriously be contended that this new territory, like the old one granted when it became a province, was subject to the same regulations and provisions and is free from past restrictions affecting the same. The enlargement is declared to be subject to the following condition by both the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of Manitoba:\nThe said increased limit and the territory thereby added to the Province of Manitoba shall be subject to all such provisions as may have been or shall hereafter be enacted respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the lands to be granted in aid thereof.\nThis point has also been decided by this court in favour of the contention of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in The Rural Municipality of Cornwallis v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co..\nI therefore agree with all the judges in the courts below that the actions of the Municipality of North Cypress and the Municipality of Argyle should be dismissed with costs.\nI cannot see that a different conclusion can be arrived at in the other case of the Springdale School District No. 263 of the North-West Territories. I must confess that I fail to appreciate the force of the reasoning of Chief Justice Killam, concurred in by Richards J. I am rather inclined to agree with Mr. Justice Dubuc that the constitution previously granted to the Territories does not affect the case. It is true that before the Canadian Pacific Railway Act was passed, namely by 38 Vict. ch. 49, ss. 7 and 11, 40 Vict. ch. 7, s. 3, 43 Vict. ch. 25, s. 9, the council and the assembly of the Territories, respectively, were authorized to establish a system of local taxation for the support of schools. But each of the above statutes contains a proviso which, it seems to me, is a complete answer to the contention of the Springdale School District:\nProvided also that no ordinance to be 80 made shall be inconsistent with or alter or repeal any provision of any Act of the Parliament of Canada * * which may now or at any time hereafter, expressly refer to the said Territories.\nThis reservation was a concession made to the Territories which must be respected, but not beyond its clear terms. I cannot conceive that until provincial autonomy be granted under the Imperial statutes to the Territories, or any part thereof, that the Parliament of Canada cannot amend, alter, or even repeal in whole or in part, any provision passed for its government; but by the above proviso the Parliament undertook to do so only by express enactments. Possibly the exemption from taxation in the Territories might be binding even if they had not been expressly mentioned, but it is not necessary to examine this point. The proviso was wisely inserted as a warning that the express orders of Parliament were to be the supreme law as long as the Territories remain part of the public domain of Canada, without provincial autonomy, which has not been granted to this day. They have not thus interpreted the proviso, although the exemption clause from taxes in favour of the Canadian Pacific Railway refers expressly to the Territories, and they, or their creatures, must abide the consequences and cannot even invoke surprise, good faith or unfairness.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal of the municipalities of North Cypress and of Argyle should be dismissed with costs, and the appeal of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company against the Springdale School District should be allowed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014Two of these appeals raised the question of the right of municipalities in the Province of Manitoba, as at present established, to tax the lands granted by the Dominion to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company under its contract in aid of the construction of its railway across the continent.\nThe question in these two appeals, of course, only applies to that part of the present territory of Manitoba taken in the year 1881 from the North-West Territories and added to the then existing Province of Manitoba by concurrent legislation of the Dominion and the province enacted by virtue of the Imperial Act, the \u201c British North America Act, 1871. \u201d\nThe legislation taking this territory out of the North-West Territories and adding it on to the Province of Manitoba was passed by the Dominion and the province in the year 1881, a very short time after the passing of the Canadian Pacific Railway Act by the Dominion, 44 Vict, ch. 1, for the construction of the railway. The third section of the B. N. A. Act, 1871, provided that the Parliament of Canada might,\nwith the consent of the legislature of any province of the Dominion, increase, diminish, or otherwise alter the limits of such province upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the said legislature.\nThe terms and conditions agreed to and incorporated in the legislation of the Dominion and the province extended to the new territory added to Manitoba all Dominion legislation which had been since the creation of Manitoba made applicable to it and then further provide that:\nThe said increased limit and the territory thereby added to the Province of Manitoba shall be subject to all such provisions as may have been or shall hereafter be enacted respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway and the lands to be granted in aid thereof.\nBefore the legislation passed, the Dominion Government had entered into the contract for the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and by statute, 44 Vict. ch. 1, sec. 1, that contract had been \u201c ratified and approved \u201d and the Government\nauthorized to perform and carry out the conditions thereof according to their purport.\nBy sect. 2 a charter was authorized to be granted as therein prescribed and which on the conditions therein mentioned being complied with was to\nhave the force and effect as if it were an Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe contract so ratified and approved was made a schedule to the Act and in accordance with clause 21 it had annexed to it, as a schedule, the corporate powers, franchises and privileges of the company which were embodied in the charter subsequently granted by the Governor and which was to have \u201c the force and effect of an Act of Parliament. \u201d\nThe 16th clause of the contract, as to the meaning of which there has been so much argument and on the construction of which so much depends, reads as follows:\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway and all stations and station grounds, workshops, buildings, yards and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances required and used for the construction and working thereof, and the capital stock of the company shall be forever free from taxation by the Dominion or by any province hereafter to be established or by any municipal corporation therein, and the lands of the company in the North-West Territories until they are either sold or occupied shall also be free from such taxation for twenty years after the grant thereof from the Crown.\nMr. Riddell and Mr. Howell on behalf of the municipalities contended:\u2014First, that the terms and conditions on which the increased territory had in 1881 been added to Manitoba, were not and could not be limitations upon its constitutional powers as a province of which the power of taxation of all lands within its bounds was one; that the Province of Manitoba was established when it was originally formed in 1870 and was not established within the meaning of the words used in the 16th clause of the contract when the additional territority was added to it. Secondly, that if there were such limitations the legislation of the Dominion Parliament ratifying and approving of the Canadian Pacific Railway contract and authorizing the issue of the charter was not an enactment \u201c respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway and the, lands to be granted in aid thereof \u201d within the meaning of these words in the terms and conditions on which the increased territory was added to Manitoba and that if even it was such an enactment, under the proper construction of clause 16 of the contract, the period of exemption from taxation had expired as the meaning of the words \u201c twenty years after the grant thereof from the Crown \u201d meant either twenty years after the contract was passed virtually granting these lands or after the lands had been earned under the contract or after they had been earned and allotted and agreed to be accepted by the company \u201c as lands fairly fit for settlement \u201d as provided for by the contract. They enforced their argument by many illustrations shewing that the word \u201c grant \u201d was used in many sections of the contract in a general and popular sense as distinguished from the technical one of the issue of the letters patent.\nA careful consideration, however, of all these arguments and of the contract itself, together with the circumstances under which it was granted and the objects sought to be attained as set out in the preamble of the Act, convince me that my first impression was correct and that the twenty years exemption from taxation of the 25,000,000 acres of land to be given in aid of the construction of the railway was to begin from and run after the issuing of the letters patent granting the lands, from time to time, after they had been earned' selected, surveyed, allotted and agreed to be accepted as complying with the general character of the lands the company was entitled to receive. I can discover no such words of present grant in the statute ratifying the contract as are to be found in the American statutes, decisions respecting the effect of the language in which were cited from the American reports as applicable to this contract and statute. I fail to see anything to justify us in putting an arbitrary construction upon the words in this section different from that which, it seems to me, in their ordinary and primary meaning, they bear. Certainly in the parts of this Dominion with which I am most familiar, the words \u201c grant from the Crown \u201d when used or spoken of in statutes or otherwise mean the letters patent from the Crown. In the absence therefore of any words of present grant I am compelled to reject the suggestion of the date or ratification of the contract as the period from which the exemption was to run. Nor am I able to see how any of the other alternative suggested periods can be accepted as fairly complying with the language of the statute. If it had been intended that any of these uncertain suggested periods were intended under the words \u201c grant from the Crown \u201d surely it was easy to say so. In my opinion, there was so much uncertainty with respect alike to the earning and selection of these lands to be granted, involving in the case of every surveyed alternate section a determination of the question as to whether the lands were fairly fit for settlement, questions, as I understand, not as yet finally determined as between the Government and the company that I do not think any one or all of these periods ever entered into the minds of the contracting parties or of Parliament as being the date from which the exemption was to run, or that any other date was thought of than that in my judgment expressed, namely, that of the grant or letters patent.\nIn all the cases before us now for consideration the letters patent had been issued before the controverted tax or assessment was levied.\nNo question therefore arises on these appeals whether or not the interest of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company could be assessed and taxed before the letters patent had issued but after the lands had been earned, surveyed and allotted by orders in council for the company, with its assent, as lands fairly fit for settlement, and whether or not by delay in taking out the letters patent the company could extend the period of exemption. Of course, if the clause operates as an exemption before and up to the time of the issue of letters patent and for twenty years after, there is an end to any question. But I do not desire to be understood as expressing any opinion upon these points which are not now before us. Under the 125th section of the British North America Act, 1867, no lands while they \u201c belonged to Canada \u201d were liable to taxation and there would be no reason for making any special provision in the contract for that period. Whether they could legally be said to belong to Canada after they had been earned and assigned to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company by orders in council so as to remain exempted under that 125th section is a question I give no opinion upon. In the cases before us the lands have ceased to belong to Canada, and their exemption from taxation must depend solely upon the construction to be given to the 16th section of the contract. The reasoning of this court in the Manitoba Swamp Lands Case ([6]), the judgment in which was approved of by the Privy Council on similar reasoning ([7]), strengthens my conviction of the soundness of my construction of this 16th clause.\nAs regards the limitations placed upon the legislative powers of Manitoba with respect to the territory added to that province by the legislation of 1881, I have no doubt that the terms and conditions on which it was provided in the 3rd section of the B. N. A. Act of 1871, that the Parliament of Canada might with the consent of the legislature of any province agree for the increase or alteration of the limits of such province were not to be confined to small matters financial or otherwise as between the province and the Dominion but were broad enough to cover any existing legislation already applicable to the territory to be added to the province and were, as used in the legislation adding the territory to Manitoba, intended to embrace and did embrace the Dominion legislation relating to the Canadian Pacific Railway and the lands granted in aid of its construction. I fully agree with the Chief Justice of the court below that it was a constitutional limitation upon the powers of the provincial legislature quoad this added territory. The extent of such limitation is of course to be determined by its language.\nMr. Riddell argued with great force that even granting such a construction to be correct it could not be applied further or beyond the three specified classes of taxation mentioned in the 16th clause of the section, namely, by the Dominion, by a province thereafter to be established, or by any municipal Corporation therein, and that the words \u201c such taxation \u201d refer to these three classes only. I am disposed to agree with him that the word \u201c therein \u201d has reference to a municipal corporation in a province thereafter to be established and that the words \u201c such taxation \u201d clearly refer to the three antecedent specified classes. If that is so, then the exemption can only be upheld by holding that so far as the added territory was concerned the Province of Manitoba was established with respect to it when and at the time it was added to the old province. I have no difficulty in accepting that as a reasonable construction and the more so as its rejection would operate to defeat the plain, clear and obvious intention of the Dominion Parliament and the Manitoba Legislature. Beyond doubt, as Mr. Robinson put it in his argument, the Province of Manitoba as it now exists was not established in 1870 nor before 1881. It was established, as it now exists and is bounded, in 1881. The Province of Manitoba was created in 1870 but its area then was comparatively small and circumscribed, a very large part of the present area of the province was added to it in 1881, and so the whole province as it now stands may fairly and reasonably be said to have been established in 1881. Whether or not apter language might have been chosen I am not prepared to say. The first part of the section makes the railway, its station grounds, buildings, yards, rolling stock and appurtenances used and required for the construction and working thereof, free from the three specific classes of taxation forever. The result of the adoption of Mr. Riddel\u013es contention would be not only to subject the railway and its appurtenances within the added territory, which under the contract was to be free from taxation forever, to such taxation as Manitoba as enlarged and added to might forever after see fit to levy, but also to withdraw from the twenty years contractual taxation exemption such lands within the added territory as were granted in aid of the construction. It is said and truly said that we have nothing to do with results in construing a statute and that is of course, in a sense, correct. But in putting a construction upon such instruments of government as these Imperial, Dominion and provincial statutes, we are bound not to ignore plain obvious facts and conditions known to all men, and if two constructions are open one of which leads to a plain repudiation of a contractual exemption from taxation created by Government and the other does not, we are more than justified in accepting the latter\nManitoba, therefore, in my opinion, having asked for an addition of lands to its territories, a block of which lands were at the time subject to be exempt from all taxation by any authority having power to tax it for a specified period, and having agreed to accept the added territory subject to the then existing Dominion enactments regarding these lands, is bound by the terms of this 16th clause as being one of those enactments. Being so bound constitutionally, an interpretation must be given to the clause which, while consistent with its language, carries out the object and intent with which it was entered into. This being so, all subsequent legislation by the Legislature of Manitoba, even if broad enough in the language used to cover the exempted block, must be read and construed subject to the exemption and not as an attempt to repudiate or escape from a constitutional limitation the province had openly accepted.\nThere remains only the question respecting the power of the Springdale School District within the North-West Territories to tax the lands of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company within its bounds. That again depends upon the meaning to be given to the words \u201c taxation by the Dominion \u201d in the exempting clause. I fully agree with the conclusion that so far as those Canadian Pacific Railway lands in the territories are concerned the Dominion was, at the time the contract was entered into, the only existing taxing power and that all taxation attempted to be laid upon them by the north-west council, or assembly, or municipality, or school district, is Dominion taxation within the meaning of these words in the exempting clause. The vast territory west of Manitoba, through which the railway was to run was practically at the time uninhabited by white men. The provisions made for its future government were temporary, tentative, and entirely subject to the control, guidance and supervision of the Dominion Parliament and authorities. The Act of 1881 was, at the time the Canadian Pacific Railway contract was entered into and when it was ratified and approved by Parliament, in force in the territories, and an important question arising out of its contraction is whether the powers it gave to the governing authorities it constituted or created were delegated or plenary powers. The Lieutenant Governor held his office during pleasure. His Council, composed of six persons, were from time to time to be appointed by the Governor General in Council to aid him in the administration of the territories. The Lieutenant Governor in Council or by and with the advice of the Legislative Assembly had such powers to make ordinances for the government of the territories as the Governor in Council might from time to time confer upon him, not in excess of those, however, conferred on the legislatures of the provinces by the 92nd and 93rd sections of the B.N.A. Act, 1867. All such powers were subject to the express proviso that no ordinance should be inconsistent with or alter or repeal any Act of the Parliament of Canada which might then or any time thereafter expressly refer to the territories or which or any part of which might be made applicable thereto by the Governor in Council. Kull powers were given to the Governor in Council by proclamation, from time to time, to apply any Act or parts of any Act of the Parliament of Canada to the territories.\nThe powers of legislation were therefore in respect to the territories vested in (1) The Parliament of Canada, (2) The Governor General in Council, and (3) The Lieutenant Governor in Council or by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly, the latter being limited in the exercise of their powers to the extent expressly given by the Governor General in Council from time to time. Section 10 gave express power to the Lieutenant Governor in Council under certain conditions to pass all necessary ordinances in respect to education and provision was made, as population increased, for the erection in the future of electoral districts and the election of members to the council until it reached 21.\nThe majority of the court below were of the opinion that the words \u201c taxation by the Dominion \u201d in the exemption clause of the contract \u201c did not include taxation by the Government of the territories or any body to be established by it within its then powers. \u201d As to what were the powers of that territorial Government the learned judge who delivered the majority opinion admitted that he had grave doubt. He says:\u2014\nThe legislation affecting the legislative powers of the territories was in a very confused state when this contract was made, and it is difficult to judge just what powers the parties to the contract considered the territorial Government to possess,\nand he concluded that it was not a\ndelegate or branch of the Dominion Government or taxation by its authority within its then powers as taxation by the Dominion.\nHe seemed to think the principles laid down in the judgment of Lord Selborne with reference, to India in The Queen v. Burah ([8])applicable to the territories and governed him with respect to this case.\nI am unable for myself to reach the conclusion that the principles with regard to legislation generally and specially with regard to India laid down in the Burah Case (1) have or can have any application to the special tentative and uncertain powers of legislation which were vested in the Lieutenant Governor in Council or the Lieutenant Governor by and with the advice of the Assembly for the North-West Territories in 1881.\nThere was no doubt at all that the legislation referred to in the Burah Case (1) was strictly within the express powers of the enacting body. Lord Selborne says, page 906:\u2014\nThe proper legislature has exercised its judgment as to place, laws, powers, and the result of that judgment has been to legislate conditionally as to all these things The conditions having been fulfilled, the legislation is now absolute.\nHow any such language could properly be used with respect to the legislation in question in the territories in this case I cannot understand. In the Burah Case (1) plenary powers of legislation existed. I agree with Chief Justice Killam that it is very difficult indeed to determine just what powers of legislation and taxation the territorial Government of the municipalities or school districts to be formed within its jurisdiction had, but whatever the extent of such powers I am satisfied they were not plenary powers in the sense in which these words are used by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Burah Case. ([9]) Most of its powers were to be given in the discretion of the Governor General in Council, from time to time, and withdrawn when and as he thought fit. The latter could also concurrently legislate by applying any part or parts of Dominion legislation to the territories.\nReliance was placed in the judgment below and in the argument before us upon the education clause of the Territories Act of 1880, sec. 10. As the section was originally enacted in 1875 and re-enacted in the consolidating Act of 1880, its operation was expressly made contingent \u201c upon a system of taxation \u201d having been first adopted in the district. That limitation upon the operation of the section was, it is true, abolished in 1885 by Parliament (48 & 49 Vict., ch. 51), but when the latter statute was passed the North-West Territories Council had already, in 1883 and 1884, passed ordinances introducing \u201c systems of taxation \u201d for municipalities and school districts throughout the territories, and the words of limitation were no longer necessary. This statute of 1885 enacted that the amendment removing the limitation from section 10 of the Act of 1880 should take effect from the date of the passing of the latter Act, presumably in order to remove any doubts as to the validity of any school taxation which might have been imposed in the meantime.\nThe learned judge from whose judgment this appeal is taken considered the clause as it stood in the Act of 1880 without the retroactive amendment sufficient to confer all necessary powers of taxation to support the action, and that if the effect of the repeal of the Acts of 1875 and 1877 was to leave no express provision for the adoption of a \u201c system of taxation \u201d he would imply from section 10 standing by itself the power to establish such a system for the purposes of the section. I have not myself been able to reach that conclusion but on the contrary think that, under the Act of 1880, in order to bring into effective force the provisions of the education clause 10, it would be necessary to have some general system of taxation introduced under authority to be granted by the Governor General in Council under the 9th section of the Act. This seems to have been the view adopted by the Lieutenant Governor in Council in introducing a system of taxation by municipalities and school districts to which I have referred.\nThe object and intent of Parliament in passing clause 10 in the Act of 1880 was not to provide for a system of taxation for the maintenance and support of schools, but to ensure to the Protestant or Roman Catholic minorities the right to have separate schools when, after population flowed in, school districts came to be established. And thus no system of taxation was expressly authorized in it nor was any language used from which it must necessarily be implied that a system of taxation for educational purposes was being authorized by the section. The substantive power conferred was to pass ordinances in respect of education. The provisos in which were inserted the incidental references to assessments and collections of rates were inserted in furtherance of the object the section had in view, namely, the protection of religious minorities. But whether I am right or not in this construction of the 9th and 10th sections of the Act cannot affect my conclusion as to the validity of the tax because I desire to base that conclusion upon the broad proposition that the exemption from \u201c taxation by the Dominion \u201d provided for in the 16th clause of the Canadian Pacific Railway contract was under the circumstances broad enough to embrace and should be held to embrace taxation either by the Lieutenant Governor in Council or with the advice of the Assembly or by any municipalities or school districts created by the Dominion in the territories.\nLook at the condition of matters as it was in the territories in 1881, when the contract was ratified and approved by Parliament. It is conceded that at that time there was no municipal corporation or school district in any part of them; that there was no Dominion statute imposing any taxation and no ordinance of the territories imposing any.\nIn his judgment in the Balgonie Case ([10]) Mr. Justice Wetmore says:\nI may just mention the fact that at the time of the passing of the Act of 1881 the North-West Council had not, so far as I can discover, passed any ordinance taxing real or personal property.\nIt was in these conditions and circumstances that the contract was passed with the exemption from taxation clause I am considering, and the question is: What meaning is to be attributed to its language ?\nI think there can be no reasonable doubt that the ratifying and confirming of the contract was legislation \u201c expressly referring to the territories \u201d within the meaning of the proviso to the 9th section of the Dominion statute of 1880, consolidating the laws constituting a government in the territories and defining and limiting its powers. That statute was in force in 1881 when the contract was ratified. I am of opinion that the powers of legislation of the North-West Territories Council were delegated powers from the Dominion and that the exemption from Dominion taxation in the 16th clause of the contract embraced and included taxation by the territorial council or by any municipal district as well as by any school district afterwards established therein. The power to tax lands generally by any school district thereafter to be brought into existence might well exist consistently with the exemption of these specially exempted lands. Any other construction leaves us in this dilemma that, if the taxation by the territorial council or its municipalities or school districts is not covered by the words \u201c Dominion taxation \u201d, then the railway bed and plant is equally liable with the lands granted in aid and the whole provision for exemption might be practically defeated. That clause being, in my opinion, part of the Dominion legislation, such a result could not be brought about by the exercise of any power acting as a delegate or agent of the Dominion. Taxation by the Dominion must embrace and include taxation by all or any authority created by it and acting under it, and such I conceive to be the relative position the North-West Territorial Government stood in with reference to the Dominion. If the exemption from taxation by the Dominion does not include taxation by the authorities it had called or was calling into existence to assist in the government of that vast territory, then we are face to face with the singular anomaly that while the Dominion could not without violating its contract ratified by Parliament directly tax the road-bed and its appurtenances, it could do so through the instrumentality of those agents, officials and governmental bodies it called into existence in the territories. And while, by the contract, the road-bed was to be forever free and the lands granted in aid free for a specified period, both were to be subject to the school taxes of the districts in which they were situated, and I should judge by analogy to the municipal and territorial taxes also. If the school districts authorised to be created by the Act of 1880 are not, when levying taxation, acting as the authorized agents of the Dominion then I would imagine that neither would the municipalities and the territorial assembly be. Municipalities and school districts alike assess and collect taxes by virtue of the ordinance of the territories. The exemption therefore which was supposed to be certain and immediate so far as the road-bed and appurtenances were concerned, and certain both as to commencement and continuance as far as the lands in aid were concerned, would be simply a contingent exemption only springing into existence upon the establishment of provinces afterwards to be created. The period of infancy and dependence when the exemption was most required would be the period when taxation on the road-bed and the lands would be levied, and the exemption from taxation would begin to operate, if it ever did so, only when it was least needed. Such may be the proper construction of the legislation I have had under consideration, and if it was we should not hesitate so to declare however incongruous or unreasonable the results would be. But, for my part, I am satisfied, for the reasons I have given, it is not so and never was so intended.\nTo sum up my conclusions on the appeal from the judgment in the Springdale Case, I am of the opinion that the powers of legislation possessed by the territorial council were delegated and not plenary powers; that the special powers relating to education granted to school districts to be subsequently brought into existence, could only be exercised for the taxation of lands after a proper ordinance had been passed by the council, the main object of that section being the protection of religious minorities; that all ordinances which the council had power to pass were to be subject to and not inconsistent with Dominion legislation especially relating to the territories. That the ratification and approval by the Dominion Parliament or the Canadian Pacific Railway contract was such legislation expressly referring to the territories and having special relation thereto, and that the meaning of the 16th clause of the contract exempting the lands granted to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in aid of the construction of its railway from Dominion taxation operated to prevent any taxation of such lands by the North-West Council or Assembly during the exemption period of twenty years following the issue of the letters patent for those lands, and that practically and substantially exemption from Dominion taxation included exemption from any school taxation which may be held to have been impliedly authorized by the 10th section of the North-West constitutional Act of 1880, to be imposed at a future time and in certain eventualities by school districts to be afterwards organized and when the necessary ordinances in that behalf had been passed by the North-West Council.\nI think the appeal in the Springdale School District Case should be allowed and the two appeals in the cases of the municipalities of North Cypress and Argyle should be dismissed with costs in all cases.\nNESBITT J.\u2014 I have had the advantage of reading the judgments of my brothers Girouard and Davies, and they have so clearly and fully stated the questions involved and their reasons for judgment, in which I fully concur, that I shall only add a few words of my own.\nI propose dealing with these three cases together although they were not so argued. I have arrived at the same result in each; viz., that the defendant company is not liable to taxation. It appears to me that the question of liability may be solved without going at length into all the arguments which were advanced. In my opinion the political and business situation of the time should be considered in arriving at a conclusion as to what Parliament and the incorporators of the company agreed to. The preamble to the statute, 44 Vict., ch. 1 (D.), makes it clear that the Government was pledged to the construction of the railway, and that the vast unoccupied tract of lands could only be developed along national lines by such construction. It is common knowledge that the enterprise was viewed as a most hazardous and speculative one, and that the people of Canada must give largely to enable the incorporators of the proposed company to finance the undertaking and to bear the early burdens of operation when no adequate return could be expected. It is also common know ledge that Manitoba expected territory to be added to her then existing boundaries, and that the remaining lands would for a long time remain as a part of the territories, and, indeed, provincial autonomy has not yet been granted to any part notwithstanding the large settlement which has taken place and the flourishing condition of the territories.\nI adopt the language of Lord Blackburn in Caledonian Railway Co. v. North British Railway Co. ([11]), at page 126:\nThe matter turns upon the construction of an Act of Parliament which is an instrument in writing. I believe there is no dispute at all that in construing an instrument in writing we are to consider what the facts were in respect to which it was framed and the object as appearing from the instrument, and taking all those together we are to see what is the intention appearing from the language when used with reference to such facts and with such an object. The facts here and the object are all apparent without stepping out of the Act itself and those other Acts of which, being public Acts, we must take judicial notice; and also that of Sir Robert P. Collier in Robertson v. Day ([12]), at page 69:\nFrom these considerations it appears more probable that the legislature intended that which the plaintiffs maintain to be the true construction of the statute; at the same time this construction ought not to be adopted if the words of the Act are clear and unambiguous and exclude such a construction. * * * It is a legitimate rule of construction to construe words in an Act of Parliament with reference to words found in immediate connection with them,\nas giving the true canon of construction to be followed in construing section 16 of the contract which, in my view, gives the exemption the railway company claims to be entitled to. That section is as follows:\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway and all stations and station grounds, workshops, buildings, yards and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances required and used for the construction and working thereof, and the capital stock of the company' shall be forever free from taxation by the Dominion, or by any province hereafter to be established or by any municipal corporation therein; and the lands of the company in the North-West Territories, until they are either sold or occupied, shall also be free from such taxation for twenty years after the grant thereof from the Crown.\nWhen I read this with the description of lands to which the company expected to earn title, the conclusion is irresistible that Parliament intended to grant by way of bonus to the company to the fullest extent of its powers freedom from taxation, so far as lands to be granted were concerned, for twenty years from the patent, with the exception that if before patent obtained the lands were sold or occupied the exemption should cease. This would give the municipalities the benefit of taxation whenever the company sold or leased, as it was no doubt expected that the well known methods in vogue in the western United States would be followed; viz., either a leasing of large tracts for grazing purposes or selling to settlers in small parcels, the purchase money being payable by instalments in many cases before the company would obtain patent, but after gaining selection. This construction makes a reasonable inducement to capitalists and leaves the company free from the burden of taxation in its early days when freedom from financial burden would be a great consideration. To hold that the lands admittedly exempted became taxable when those lands were added to Manitoba in face of the provision\nthe said increased limit and the territory thereby added to the Province of Manitoba shall be subject to all such provisions as may have been or shall hereafter be enacted respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway and the lands to be granted in aid thereof\nwould be to make the provision wholly nugatory, and I think Manitoba was granted and received this territory with this special exemption attached and has not attempted to repeal it, if, as was argued, it could repeal this provision, and, in my view, the later taxing statutes of Manitoba do not purport to repeal this provision.\nIn the case of the tax levied in the North-West Territories to give effect to the contention of the appellants would in reality be to hold that the contract did not exempt the land while in the North-West Territories but to make it subject to taxation and to be exempt only when the contingency of provincial autonomy occurred, if it ever did occur within twenty years from the issue of the patents. Such a construction is so opposed to good sense and good faith and so foreign to the object of the contract that apparently it never occurred to any one until after the opening of the argument of the case before the court in Manitoba. In my view the company's lands to be earned by building the railway were exempted for twenty years from the issue of the patent, from any Dominion taxation, or from provincial or municipal taxation, by any bodies subsequently obtaining provincial or municipal authority in respect of such lands. If any difference is suggested in the case of school districts which the territorial authorities then had the power of creating, I think the Dominion still retained complete control over them, and taxation by such a body was taxation in conflict with the contract of the supreme authority (the Dominion) and by the very statute authorizing the ordinances creating the school district would be unauthorized as being inconsistent with existing Dominion legislation expressly referring to the territories.\nI think the American cases of statutory grant of lands to be selected in future are quite distinguishable, the word \u201c hereby \u201d apparently controlling those decisions in holding the grant to be as of the date of the legislation, and I adhere to my previous opinion in the Manitoba Swamp Lands Case ([13]) in that respect. I would dismiss the Manitoba appeals and allow the North-West appeal, all with costs.\nAppeals by the municipalities of North Cypress and Argyle dismissed with costs; appeal by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appeliant municipalities and the respondent school district: Howell, Mathers & Howell.\nSolicitors for the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., respondents and appellants: Tupper, Phippen & Tupper.\n[1] 14 Man.

S. Osier K.C. for the Canadian Copper Co.\nBlackstock K.C. is heard on an objection to the jurisdiction of the court to consider the first six questions referred.\nSection 4 of 54 & 55 Vict., ch. 25, amending section 37 of the \"Act respecting the Supreme and Exchequer Courts,\" authorizes the submission to the Supreme Court of \"important questions of law or fact touching provincial legislation or the appellate jurisdiction as to educational matters vested in the Governor in Council by The British North America Act, 1867, or by any other Act or law or touching the constitutionality of any legislation of the Parliament of Canada or touching any other matter with reference to which he sees fit to exercise this power.\"\nWe submit that the expression \"provincial legislation\" above referred to means some Act actually passed by a provincial legislature the constitutionality of which is challenged, and does not include speculative or academical questions as to the powers possessed by such legislature.\nIf this interpretation be correct the reference cannot be justified except it fall within the expression later on in the same section \"touching any other matter with reference to which he sees fit to exercise this power.\" But any other matter must be construed as ejusdem generis with what goes before; in any event it only refers to some concrete, definite question which has actually arisen from particular circumstances and not to speculative matters which may possibly never arise. Sandiman v. Breach[1]; Reg. v. Cleworth[2]; Palmer v. Snow[3]. The section was intended to cover the case of questions actually arising from the action of rival legislative authorities and not questions of this character, where the legislature may never assume to exercise the powers respecting which the court is called upon to make a deliverance.\nIn addition to these reasons adduced from a consideration of the statute itself, it is submitted that an intention of this kind cannot be imputed to the Parliament of Canada, because it would be an invasion of the rights, not only of provincial legislatures, but of the individual citizen in the province. The first authority to interpret the British North America Act and to determine the jurisdiction of the federal and provincial authorities are the federal and provincial Legislatures, and these bodies are entitled to bring their actual legislation, passed after full deliberation and debate, before the ordinary tribunals of the country, unembarrassed by judicial opinions expressed in advance of the legislation itself. It is obviously not only a most inconvenient practice that is here resorted to, but it constitutes a very grave and serious invasion of the rights and powers of all those authorities among whom are partitioned the various legislative functions distributed by the British North America Act.\nWe also refer to the provisions of ch. 49 of R.S.O. (1897), which shows that the legislature of Ontario only concurred in the jurisdiction conferred upon the Supreme Court by the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act to the extent of the submission thereto of actual \"controversies\" between the Dominion and the Province. When questions touching Sunday legislation were submitted under a somewhat similar statute to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and subsequently by way of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council [Attorney General for Ontario v. Hamilton Street Railway Co.[4]] their Lordships answered the question propounded as to the validity of an Act passed by the Legislature of Ontario and declared the same ultra vires that body, but as to the other questions submitted, which are of the same character as those propounded here, they declined to pass upon them, the Lord Chancellor using this language, at page 529 of the report:\u2014\n\"With regard to the remaining questions, which it has been suggested should be reserved for further argument, their Lordships are of opinion that it would be inexpedient and contrary to the established practice of this Board to attempt to give any judicial opinion upon those questions. They are questions proper to be considered in concrete cases only; and opinions expressed upon the operation of the sections referred to, and the extent to which They are applicable, would be worthless for many reasons. They would be worthless as being speculative opinions on hypothetical questions. It would be contrary to principle, inconvenient, and inexpedient that opinions should be given upon such questions at all. When they arise they must arise in concrete cases, involving private rights, and it would be extremely unwise for any judicial tribunal to attempt beforehand to exhaust all possible cases and facts which might occur to qualify, cut down, and override the operation of particular words when the concrete case is not before it.\"\nLanguage of a similar character was used in reference thereto by Osier and Moss, JJ. A., when the case was before the Court of Appeal.\nNewcombe K.C. contra referred to Severn v. The Queen[5].\nThe court reserved judgment on the objection to the jurisdiction and proceeded with the hearing on the merits.\nNewcombe K.C. was heard, and was followed by Patterson K. C. and Macpherson. They contended that the legislation would be valid as dealing with civil rights and matters of a local and private nature in the province; also that, even if the subject matter was within the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament, the legislature could deal with it so long as Parliament abstained. The other counsel were not called upon.\nThe judgment of the court was as follows:\u2014\nAfter the fullest consideration of the 37th section of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, under which this reference is made to us, and of the strong observations made by the Judicial Committee in the reference made by the Government of Ontario to the Court of Appeal of that province in the matter of the Hamilton Street Railway Company, reported on appeal to the Judicial Committee,[6], at page 528, as to the principle, convenience and expediency of courts of justice answering hypothetical questions submitted to them as distinct from those arising in concrete cases, we are of the opinion that the questions submitted to us as to whether certain supposed or hypothetical legislation which the legislature of one of the provinces might in the future enact would be within the powers of such legislature, are not within the purview of the section. Questions as to the constitutionality of existing legislation are clearly within the meaning of that 37th section, and the general words \"touching any other matter\" must be considered as within the rule ejusdem generis, and may well refer to orders in council by the Governor General or Lieutenant Governors, as the case may be, passed pursuant to the Dominion or provincial legislation the constitutionality of which may be in question, or to departmental regulations authorized by statute. These orders in council cover a very large legislative area, and include regulations on the subjects of navigation, pilotage, fisheries, crown lands, forests, mines and minerals. For the first time this question of jurisdiction has been raised by one of the interested parties, and for that reason we feel bound to express the foregoing views, from which Mr. Justice Sedgewick dissents. As, however, the practice of this court heretofore has been to answer questions similar to those now submitted as to the power to legislate vested in the Dominion or the Provinces and on appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council answers have been given by that Board on the assumption that the questions were warranted by the section to which we have referred, we will follow in this case, subject to the expression of the foregoing views, the practice of the courts on similar references a,nd proceed to answer the questions as follows;\nIn answer to question (1), we are unable to distinguish the draft bill submitted for our opinion from the Act pronounced by the Judicial Committee in the case before referred to as ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature and think, for the reasons given in that case by the Lord Chancellor, that this draft bill as a whole is also ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature. This answer covers also questions (2) and (3). With regard to the other questions (4) to (7) inclusive, it appears to us that the day, commonly called Sunday, or the Sabbath, or the Lord's Day, is recognised in all Christian countries as an existing institution, and that legislation having for its object the compulsory observance of such day or the fixing of rules of conduct (with the usual sanctions) to be followed on that day, is legislation properly falling within the views expressed by the Judicial Committee in the Hamilton Street Railway reference before referred to and is within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament.\nIt is (Mr. Justice Sedgewick dissenting from this view) undesirable and inexpedient if not altogether impossible properly to answer categorically the questions enumerated in question 7. The rule suggested by the Privy Council is, we think, peculiarly applicable to those questions and it is quite clear that useful or satisfactory answers could only be given to them when the questions arise in concrete cases under the statutes.\n(Signed) Robt. Sedgewick J.\n\" D. GiroUard J.\n\" L. H. Davies J.\n\" Wallace NesbITt J.\nSedgewick J.\u2014In differing from my learned brothers, as indicated in the foregoing, it is necessary for me, under the statute, to give my reasons.\nFirst, upon the question of jurisdiction. The original section 37 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act giving power to the Governor in Council to refer any matter to this court for its consideration and opinion is couched in as wide and general terms as human language could enable Parliament to do. Under this section, as it then stood, the Governor in Council had power to propound any question to this court, whether that question related to a matter of law or fact or even policy. Now when, in 1891, Parliament was pleased to repeal the original section 37 and substitute in its place the present one, its object was, and I think its sole object was, to give express parliamentary authority to the Governor in Council in respect to the several matters therein mentioned, but in no way whatever to limit or modify the powers already possessed by the Executive.\nSecondly, I do not think this is a case in which the doctrine of ejusdem generis applies, but, even if that principle does apply, then this is a case falling within it. In my view, to submit a question asking this court to determine whether a proposed Act (giving us the draft of it) is within the competency of a provincial legislature is a similar or like question to, or ejusdem generis with, a question asking us to pass upon the constitutionality of a provincial Act. If we decide that neither the Act itself nor the proposed Act is within such competency, then they fall within the same category, and therefore the doctrine referred to applies.\nI feel it to be my duty to answer, not only the questions already answered by my brother judges and myself, but also the rest of them, and my answer is in the negative, basing my opinion upon the Privy Council case above referred to and the fact that all the matters dealt with in the particular statutes mentioned fall within the ambit of the criminal law of Canada.\nIdington J.\u2014The questions are raised here of the right of the Governor General in Council to ask and the jurisdiction of this court to answer questions of a speculative character touching the constitutionality of proposed or possible future legislation by the Parliament of Canada or the legislature of any of the provinces of Canada and having no relation to actual existing legislation enacted by any of these bodies.\nIt is urged that the 37th section of \"The Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act\" gives this right to ask and this power to answer, and it is said that, even if this be not so, it has been the practice heretofore to answer such questions, and that such practice should be now followed. I cannot find that such a practice has been so followed or followed for so long a time as to constitute it an established usage that has grown thereby to be law that must govern the conduct of this court.\nIt must be admitted that the deliberate adoption by the court of such a practice, when that adoption could not be attributed to any authority but this section 37 or that for which it is substituted, should be looked upon as an interpretation of these sections or one of them which now should bind all the judges of this court. In considering the question from this point of view it is worth while to review the cases. The New Brunswick penitentiary case of April, 1880, is shewn by the original records to have been a question as to the validity of Acts of the Parliament of Canada passed for the creation and regulation of penitentiaries. The Province and Dominion, I infer by consent, submitted a case, using this power of reference, however, to bring the matter before this court. The cases from Perth and Kent counties in 1884 upon the Canada Temperance Act, 1878, involved questions as to conditions precedent to the Governor in Council acting in bringing into operation the powers conferred by that Act. The \"Thrasher case\" arose out of contentions as to the status of the Supreme Court of British Columbia and the power of the legislature of that province to legislate in regard to procedure in that court and in regard to the residences of the judges thereof. It had been suggested that the court, having had an existence and power over its own procedure prior to the Province of British Columbia coming into confederation in 1871, was not a provincial court within the meaning of the 14th subsection of section 92 of the British North America Act and was not subject to legislation that the Legislature of the Province of British Columbia, as a member of confederation subject to the British North America Act, had enacted.\nThis reference was in 1883. See Thrasher Case[7].\nHis Excellency the Governor General was petitioned in 1889 to submit by way of reference to this court under sec. 52 of \"The Supreme and Exchequer Courts Acts\" the much agitated questions in respect of \"The Jesuits' Estates Act.\" The late Sir John Thomson, then Minister of Justice, in reporting upon this position amongst other things said to His Excellency as follows: This provision which confers that power on your Excellency was undoubtedly intended to enable the Governor General to obtain an opinion from the Supreme Court of Canada in relation to some order which his Government might be called upon to make or in relation to some action which his officers might be called on to adopt[8].\nI think all the cases that can be said to have been referred solely by virtue of sec. 52 to this court down to the time when this opinion was expressed came well within the description here given of the class of cases that should or might be so referred.\nThere were other cases that, meantime, had been referred, which, if a wider meaning or province than Sir John Thompson assigned to sec. 52 and especially that now urged on us as what it bore, were to be given it, one would have expected to have seen them referred by virtue of the power and authority of sec. 52 unaided by special enactment giving jurisdiction.\nA most significant instance is the special legislation contained in 47 Vict. ch. 32, sec. 28, specially providing for this court determining, on the Governor in Council referring to it the question, as to the competence of Parliament to pass \"The Liquor License Act, 1883 and amendments thereto\" in whole or in part. Why was the then existing power under sec. 52 to refer to this court thus questioned if it extended beyond the class of cases defined by Sir John Thompson? Was this special statutory reference of the constitutional limitations then in question and the trial of the conflict of authority between the Parliament of Canada and the Provinces being thus provided for, not a Parliamentary exposition of the meaning of sect. 52?\n\"The Railway Committee\" was by the Railway Act, 1888, sec. 19, empowered to state a case for the opinion of this court upon any question which the Committee might think to be a question of law. And by sec. 20 of the same Act, the court was directed to hear and determine such questions of law. And,\u2014\"Was not this also, but in a more indirect way, to a limited extent, the case with the enactment of sees. 19 and 20 in the Railway Act, 1888, empowering the Committee to state a case for the opinion of the court upon such question of law as the Committee might desire such an opinion? It was under this and not as stated under sec. 52 that the Manitoba Crossings case was referred in 1888.\nIt is to be borne in mind that this sec. 52 was in its essential feature copied from sect. 4 of the statute (3 & 4 William IV. ch. 41) constituting the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\nIt is to be observed that the Privy Council was a consultative body and the committee then after all but a part of such body and so remained, to such an extent that, in 1871, so high an authority as Lord Cairns declared that even then the Judicial Committee had no judicial power and was not a judicial body but merely \u2014as a portion of the Council \u2014a consultative assembly. See Finlayson's History etc., of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, p. iii.\nWithout going further into the question this view of the origin of sec. 52 is suggestive.\nAnd all this review of the origin of sec. 52 and the uses to which it has been put and the light in which it has been held enable me to conclude that under it there was no reference of a question such as asked here for agitating or framing future legislation and that so far as any assistance is to be got from that source in the interpretation of the present sec 37 substituted for it there is nothing to lead me to place upon it the wide meaning now contended for but rather the contrary.\nThis origin of the clause is also to be considered in viewing the matter as I do hereinafter from the point of view of the meaning to be put upon sec. 101 of the British North America Act.\nSec. 37 (substituted for sec. 52) so far as now in question is as follows:\nImportant questions of law or fact touching provincial legislation, or the appellate jurisdiction as to educational matters vested in the Governor in Council by the \"British North America Act, 1867\", or by any other act or law, or touching the constitutionality of any legislation of the Parliament of Canada, or touching any other matter with reference to which he sees fit to exercise this power, may be referred, by the Governor in Council, to the Supreme Court for hearing or consideration; and the court shall thereon hear and consider the same.\nUnder this, enacted in 1891, The Manitoba Schools Act to which it is specially applicable was referred and all the questions asked seem clearly incidental to the question raised by that Act.\nIn re Provincial Jurisdiction to pass Prohibitory Liquor Laws,[9] (in 1895) was a case submitted by reference under sec. 37. Then the question of the jurisdiction of the Provincial Legislature to pass the actual legislation of the Ontario Legislature by 53 Vict., \"An Act to improve the Liquor License Acts\" and 54 Vict. ch. 46, \"An Act respecting local option in the matter of liquor selling\", raised many questions touching that legislation.\nThe questions submitted, save as to manufacture and importation of liquor, were, I think, arising directly from or upon this legislation, and the questions in relation to manufacture and importation were, if more remotely connected therewith, yet germane to the others. It is upon this case alone that counsel supporting the reference now in hand sought to rest the right and power now challenged. It is to be noted no such challenge or question was then made as to this right or power. In Re Fisheries,[10] (in 1895) the questions were all such as were directly suggested by the actual legislation of the Dominion Parliament, or of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario, or in respect of the proprietary rights in dispute between the Dominion and the provinces or some of them.\nIn Re Criminal Code, Bigamy Sections,[11] (1897), the questions referred are all directly in relation to an Act or law of the Dominion Parliament.\nIn Re Representation in the House of Commons,[12] (April 1903), the questions referred were not in relation to any Act or law of the Dominion Parliament or any other of the specific subjects named in section 37, but in fact upon the interpretation to be given to certain of the provisions of the British North America Act.\nIt appears, however, upon the face of the reference that it was made at the request of the provinces interested, and that they had asked that a reference be made to the Supreme Court of Canada for a determination of the question in difference.\nIn the matter of The Representation of Prince Edward Island in the House of Commons,[13] (June, 1903), the questions referred to were of same nature and upon the proper interpretation to be given to certain provisions of the British North America Act and an Imperial order in council admitting Prince Edward Island into the Union. It also was at the request of the province \"that a reference be made to the Supreme Court of Canada for a determination of the question in difference\" just as in the last named case.\nDoes this phase of the order make any difference? The reference in each of these later cases purports to be made \"pursuant to the authority of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act as amended by the Act 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 25\" and with the approval or upon the suggestions respectively of the province or provinces concerned.\nThe Dominion and Provincial representatives appeared before the court and urged their respective claims.\nThis court was by the 1st section of the Act constituting it declared to be \"constituted and established a court of common law and equity in and for the Dominion of Canada.\"\nIts powers, given directly by the Act, are almost entirely of an appellate character, and it has been repeatedly said not to have inherent original jurisdiction, and with none conferred by statute but the right to issue a writ of habeas corpus.\nI am not prepared, however, to say that having been constituted and established such a court, as just stated, for the Dominion of Canada that it is incompetent to hear such submission and determine the differences between parties, as the Dominion and the provinces submitting a case, consenting to be bound, as in these representation cases seems to have been the nature of the proceeding.\nI would prefer to attribute its action in these cases to this consent and that source of power and authority rather than that to be drawn from the words in section 37 quoted above, i. e, \"or touching any other matter with reference to which he sees fit to exercise this power\"\nI agree with the majority of the court that these general words must be read as within the rule of law generally known as the ejusdem generis rule which was enunciated by Lord Campbell, as follows:\nI accede to the principle laid down in all the cases which have been cited, that, where there are general words following particular and specific words, the general words must be confined to things of the same kind as those specified.\nSee Hardcastle, page 200 et seq.\nIt will be observed that there are specified in this section 37:\n(1) Important questions of law or fact touching provincial legislation;\n(2) In the appellate jurisdiction as to educational matters vested in the Governor in Council by the British North America Act;\n(3) Or by any other Act or law;\n(4) Or touching the constitutionality of any legislation of the Parliament of Canada.\nIt can hardly be said that the speculative questions involving something that may never become even the subject of a bill in the legislature is \"provincial legislation.\" I take it that provincial legislation means that which has been passed. For the purposes of argument it might be assumed as possibly meaning a bill passing through the legislature, and yet it could not be stretched to apply here.\nIndeed it was not seriously argued that it could be supported by these words but might be rested on the general words of \"any other matter.\"\nThe words in the original section which this sec. 37 amends were \"may refer to the Supreme Court for hearing or consideration any matter which he thinks fit to refer,\" etc.\nWhy were such comprehensive and unlimited words as these stricken out, and those now under consideration substituted if we are yet to read the general words in the substitution as unrestricted by the ejusdem generis rule or indeed anything else?\nWe ought, I submit, to credit Parliament with some intention or purpose and probably with some knowledge of the rules of construction. When we consider the words of sec. 101 of the British North America Act, which enabled the Parliament of Canada to\nprovide for the constitution, maintenance and organization of a general Court of Appeal for Canada, and for the establishment of any additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada,\nand we find that there were used in doing so, words very apt for expressing the duties of a consultative body, but that might not be found so apt for the defining of the powers of a Court of Appeal, or other additional courts, as judicial bodies, commonly known and understood as such, we may find reason for the radical change of power that this amendment was intended to make. What might be innocuous in the constituting of and defining of the duties of a judicial committee of the Privy Council in England, where the historic traditions and constitutional usages having the force of law, would restrain such wide expressions of power within recognised limits might, set in the place they were here, become a source of danger, a temptation in times of stress and storm to great abuse The experience of sixteen years may have taught this and resulted in this amendment. I will rather infer this, and the purpose to restrict, than adopt the theory that it meant nothing.\nHaving regard to all the applications of the executive to this court, under or purporting to be under this statute at large, or specifically under the section thereof now in question, and to the fact that in most of the cases there was in fact but a mutual submission of points in dispute to the court, and in such cases possibly but little regard had to the form, save as a means of executing this mutual purpose; and to the important fact that not in a single case had the right or power been challenged by any of the parties, and hence never argued, till this reference; I do not consider that the decisions given under such circumstances are to be treated as at any time an interpretation by the court of the general words used and now in question in such way and to such extent and with such meaning as we are asked in face of objection by those having a right to object, to accept here and act upon.\nNone of the cases have gone so far, in assuming jurisdiction to exist, as would be required, here, to answer speculative questions.\n\"We are asked, here, to say that the court has interpreted its jurisdiction in a way that I do not find it has, and then to extend it further.\nThe jurisdiction to pass upon proposed or only possible future legislation, such as the governing power of the people might never assent to, is one of so grave a character fraught with such far reaching consequences, and such a departure from the recognised principle of severing and keeping as distinct as possible the respective powers and duties of the legislative, executive and judicial functions of Government that I would desire to see the power we are asked here to exercise distinctly and clearly conferred by Parliament, if it is to be conferred at all, rather than by an assumption of its existence on such slender basis as is alleged here to have expressed its existence.\nAll constitutional authority has placed stress upon the benefits flowing from the keeping distinct and independent the several duties of the legislative, executive and judicial functions of Government.\nTo bring into action the judicial authority in respect of future possible legislation before the matter has passed through the beneficent ordeal of public discussion, parliamentary investigation, and solemn determination in the high court of Parliament or Legislative Assembly is, I respectfully submit, an innovation. I am not concerned here to lay down nor do I try to lay down any course of duty to be pursued by Parliament in that regard, but it seems to me that to adopt such an innovation it ought to be made clear beyond doubt as the will and intention of Parliament before I presume to attribute to it the innovating purpose that assuming jurisdiction here would clearly involve.\nI desire to abstain from and to be understood as abstaining from any expression of opinion as to the power of Parliament in Canada to exercise any such innovating power and establish in this or any other court such a jurisdiction as we are asked here to exercise in that regard.\nThere is much that is instructive in regard to this and matters of a like nature in the constitutional history of the United States from the time when under Chief Justice Jay the Supreme Court of that country declined upon request of the President to interpret a treaty with France, down to the present time. See Story on Con. U. S. p. 388 and 24 Am Law Review, p. 372 et seq.\nHence in that country (where every phase of resorting to judicial authority, for defining by adjudication constitutional limits), the duties of the judge when called upon to do so, have been the subject of much serious consideration.\nCooley on Constitutional Limitations, (5 ed.), at page 192, says, in speaking of that duty:\nIt must be evident to any one the power to declare a legislative enactment void is one which the judge, conscious of the fallibility of the human judgment, will shrink from exercising in any case where be can conscientiously and with due regard to duty and official oath decline the responsibility.\nI, not being able to find that jurisdiction to answer, accept this high authority on the fruits of experience I have referred to, as some light upon the way to discharge the duty to be done, under such circumstances as my finding leaves me. Not having jurisdiction I should not go further.\nI, with great deference for the opinion of the majority of the court who come to the like conclusion I do, in regard to the want of jurisdiction, yet can find their way by reason of practice to express an opinion on the question submitted, feel I am constrained by the decided view I take as to the matter, to dissent from such a course, and, with the highest respect for the authority asking an answer to the questions submitted, must ask to be, for the reasons I have given, excused from answering question No. 1. My reasons given above are specially directed to question 1 and such as are of like character looking to future legislation and 1 to 6 are chiefly so.\nQuestion No. 1 being answered in the negative I understood counsel for the Attorney General of Canada not to desire further prosecution of the inquiry as to these matters, 1 to 6, inclusive, and treat them as a group to be dealt with in like manner as the first.\nI have read with interest the protest made, in Re Manitoba Educational Statutes[14], at page 677, by the present Chief Justice of the court in regard to the jurisdiction in question, but his point of view taken there is so entirely different from that I have taken, that I have for that reason, and that only, refrained from adverting to it in giving my reasons.\nAs to question 7 and the sub-sections of it, many matters which are no doubt within the range of \"important questions of law or fact touching provincial legislation\" are referred to and therefore within the jurisdiction given by these words in sec. 37. Upon questions properly framed (as to some of these matters) so as to discriminate between that which may be within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada and that within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures answers might be given that might serve some useful purpose.\nA. categorical answer to the question 7 (a) or 7 (b) cannot be given without probably misleading, and to answer with such limitations as would be necessary to avoid this it might be found after the best possible consideration had been given to the matter that further limitations than given in such answer would be necessary to cover the entire ground. The same holds true in a less degree as to each of the other sub-questions of question 7.\nThis is probably only another way of expressing the necessity for a concrete case before passing upon the question.\nI desire to refrain from expressing (especially as the matter with only an ex parte argument now stands) any opinion as to the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada over any of the subject matters touched upon in question\nIn assenting as I do under the circumstances of this reference to the disposition made by the majority of the court of question 7 for reasons stated by them, I do so without intending to assent to anything in such reasons, or their opinions, that might by implication or otherwise be held as declaring that any or all of the matters in question fall within the exclusive or other jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\n[1] 7.

Judgment appealed from (9 Can. Crim. Cas. 53) reversed, Davies and Idington JJ. dissenting.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], affirming, on an equal division of opinion, the conviction of the appellant on the verdict of the jury rendered at the trial.\nThe prisoner, appellant, was indicted \"for that he, on the 18th day of May, 1904, at St. Margaret's Bay Road, in the County of Halifax, with intent to disable one William Hill, did unlawfully wound the said William Hill, by shooting at him, the said William Hill, with a loaded gun.\" On a reserved case stated by Mr. Justice Townshend, the judge at the trial, to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, the learned judge referred to the evidence and then proceeded as follows:\n\"I told the jury that under the evidence they could convict the prisoner of the charge laid in the indictment if they were satisfied he intended to disable Hill at the time he fired the gun, and that he fired with that object, and that they were at liberty to infer such intent from the facts in evidence. If they thought he had no such intent at the time, still they could convict him of the lesser offence, under section 242, of unlawfully wounding Hill with the gun because of his unlawful act in pointing a loaded gun, and firing it at Hill, and it was for them to say whether the accused knew or ought to have known that it was loaded, and whether he did point it at Hill; that it was not necessary to constitute this offence to prove actual malice. It was enough that it was unlawful.\n\"The jury, after deliberation, returned a verdict of 'Guilty without malicious intent,' and that verdict I accepted, and it was recorded as found.\n\"The prisoner's counsel, Mr. Power, then requested me to reserve for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, sitting as a Court of Appeal for Crown Cases Reserved, certain questions of law which I do now state and reserve. These questions are: (a) \"Whether or not upon the finding of the jury a verdict of acquittal should have been entered? (b) Were my instructions in law correct?\n\"I sentenced the prisoner to two years in Dorchester Penitentiary, but did not respite the execution of the sentence.\"\nThe reserved case was heard before the full court composed of all the judges of that court, including the trial judge, the result being an equal division in opinion, Weatherbe C. J. and Graham and Russell JJ. holding that the conviction should be quashed, while Townshend, Meagher and Fraser JJ. considered it valid. The questions argued upon the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nJohn J. Power for the appellant.\nLongley K. C., Attorney-General for Nova Scotia, for the respondent. The judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nGrirouabd J.\u2014At the July Assizes, 1904, at Halifax, the appellant was indicted for that he, on the 18th May, 1904, at St. Margaret's Bay Road, in the County of Halifax, with the intent to disable one \"William Hill, did unlawfully wound the said William IIill by shooting at him with a loaded gun. The jury after deliberation returned a verdict of \"guilty without malicious intent\" and that verdict the trial judge accepted and, upon being recorded as found, he sentenced the prisoner to two years in the Dorchester Penitentiary and did not respite the execution of the sentence. At the same time at the request of prisoner's counsel, Mr. Power, the learned judge reserved two questions.\n(a) Whether or not upon the finding of the jury a verdict of acquittal should have been entered? (b) Were my instructions in law correct?\nThe reserve case came before the court in banco with the result that the court was evenly divided, Weatherbe O. J., and Graham and Russell JJ. for quashing the conviction; Townshend J., who presided at the trial, Meagher and Fraser JJ. for affirming the conviction.\nIt is contended on the part of the appellant that the addition made by the jury to their verdict \"guilty \", of the words ''without malicious intent\", amounted to an acquittal. The majority of the court is of that opinion.\nIt is conceded by the judges affirming the conviction that the verdict is not a conviction of the offence mentioned in section 241 of the Criminal Code under which the prisoner was indicted. It is contended that it is valid under section 242 which provides that every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to three years imprisonment who\nunlawfully wounds or inflicts any grievous bodily harm on any other person either with or without an instrument. Probably the jury could have returned a verdict under this section or a verdict of common assault, but they have not done so. Their finding that the offence committed by the prisoner, whatever it might be, was without \"malicious intent\", removed the essential requirement of a crime, whether malice is to be inferred from an unlawful act or is \"express.\" We have the less hesitation in arriving at this conclusion because the Attorney General for the Province of Nova Scotia, (Hon. Mr. Longley), declared before us that he could not sustain the verdict as worded.\nWithout going further into the examination of the reasons of the learned judges pro and con, we order that the said conviction be quashed and the prisoner discharged from the said penitentiary.\nDavies J. (dissenting):\u2014This was an appeal upon a Crown case reserved by Mr. Justice Townshend. On the hearing the six judges were equally divided for and against sustaining the conviction. The two questions reserved were (a) Whether on the verdict rendered an acquittal should have been entered? and (b) Were the judge's instructions to to the jury correct?\nI am of the opinion that a verdict of acquittal should not have been entered on the jury's finding and also that the judge's instructions were correct.\nI would have been content to express my simple concurrence in the judgment prepared by my brother Idington were it not for the reference therein to the question of \"common assault\" which does not appear from the record to have been referred to at the trial or on the hearing of the case reserved and was not raised or touched upon by the prisoner's counsel before us. 1 do not wish to be understood as expressing any opinion upon the point discussed by my brother Idington. In all other respects I concur in his opinion. The prisoner was indicted under the 241st section of the Code for wounding one Hill with intent. The trial judge told the jury, I think properly, that they could, under the provisions of the Code, convict the prisoner of the lesser offence simply of \"wounding\" under the 242nd section, if they were not satisfied he was guilty of the offence of wounding with intent specially charged against him under section 241 and that to find him guilty of the lesser offence it was not necessary for the Crown to prove or for them to find actual malice.\nThe jury returned a verdict of \"guilty without malicious intent\". I think that verdict means just what it says. The jury found the intent which is an essential element in the offence defined by section 241 to be wanting. The prisoner, therefore, was entitled to be acquitted of that offence. The finding of the absence of malicious intent negatived the existence of \"actual malice\" on the part of the prisoner about which the judge had instructed them. But it meant neither more nor less than that. I construe the verdict to mean\u2014\"We find the prisoner guilty of the lesser offence of wounding under the 242nd section as he had no malice and no intent\"\u2014or, as they put it, malicious intent. To complete the offence under the 242nd section \"intent\" or malicious intent was not an essential ingredient. It was such an essential element to complete the offence defined in the 241st section. The jury found that ingredient wanting but that the defendant was guilty. It seems to me, therefore, plain beyond reasonable doubt that he must be acquitted under the 241st section and convicted under the 242nd section of the offence without the intent pursuant to the power contained in the 713th section of the Code.\nThat is what the trial judge did and I think he was right. I agree with him that the case of The Queen v. Latimer,[2] decided unanimously by six judges all experienced in criminal law, is ample authority, if such was needed, for his decision.\nIt was said by one of the learned judges in the court below that we are not entitled to indulge in speculations as to the meaning of the jury's verdict. I agree, but think speculation as to this verdict quite unnecessary. On the other hand I do not think I am justified in giving effect to arguments which present themselves to my mind merely as subtle refinements upon words and which would nullify what appears to me a plain and clear verdict.\nIdington J. (dissenting):\u2014The appellant was tried upon an indictment preferred under section 241 of the Code and found by the verdict of the jury who tried him, ''guilty without malicious intent\".\nThe learned trial judge upon this verdict sentenced the prisoner but reserved certain questions which as finally settled were\n(a) Whether or not upon the finding of the jury a verdict of acquittal should have been entered? (b) Were my instructions in law correct?\nI do not think that the verdict was one of acquittal.\nI am, with due respect, unable to understand how such a contention can have any solid foundation in law, when regard is had to the provisions of section 713, where it is said:\u2014\nEvery count shall be deemed divisible; and if the commission of the offence charged, as described in the enactment creating the offence, or as charged in the count, includes the commission of any other offence, the person accused may be convicted of any offence so included, which is proved, although the whole offence charged is not proved; etc., etc.\nThis was intended to avoid the necessity of repeating in a needless multiplication of counts, as ancient learning rendered necessary, substantially the same or a minor cognate offence but having otherwise a slight variation in degree of criminality.\nThe indictment charged that the prisoner\nwith intent to disable one William Hill, did unlawfully wound the said William Hill by shooting at him.\nThe indictment, if the intent had been stricken out, would have been a perfectly good indictment charging accused with \"unlawful wounding\" and such charge was, in the language of section 713, included in the charge as described and would have been included in the commission of the offence charged and as described, and when and if the proof of intent fell short of establishing the charge as laid but proved the charge without the intent it became the duty of the jury to acquit the accused of the offence as charged and find him guilty of the unlawful wounding.\nThis, I take it, is clearly the evolution of law that the Code in this regard is intended to express and declare to be the law in substitution of what had gone before.\nIt is not an uncommon thing for juries to return such verdicts, with simply stating without intent, and I think it can make not the slightest difference that they used an adjective that aptly described the sort of intent that was here charged, and may mean and I think was intended by the jurors to mean, more than the mild form of malice that the law imputes to every man who infringes even in the most trifling manner the criminal law.\nThe intent to disable another carries with it actual deliberation that may be well designated malicious in the wilful sense of the word, and to discriminate that from the legal malice implied in unlawful wounding is all that the jury no doubt meant. To impute to them something else is, I submit, with due respect, a clear departure from the canons of construction that require words to be read and interpreted in the light of the surrounding facts and circumstances and by their plain and ordinary meaning.\nTo interpret such a verdict as an acquittal seems to me to 'treat the jurors' verdict differently from what we would the expressions of other ordinary people, trying to express their meaning.\nAs to the proper interpretation to be put upon these words we are not, by the case, left free to determine otherwise than as to whether or not an acquittal. If not an acquittal our duty as to that ends.\nI am not quite free from doubt as to whether it might not be said that as the statute allows a verdict of assault to be rendered upon such a count the jury might not, if properly directed, have found prisoner guilty of assault. This, however, is not what I would draw from reading the charge as laid and the verdict without looking beyond. And if we turn to the judge's charge, as I think we can here to any part of the case submitted, and see no allusion to the third alternative of an assault, it seems less chance exists for having any doubt as to the meaning of the jury.\nThis is not a case where, as in Reg. v. Gray,[3] the jury expressly negatived fraud which was of the essence of the crime there charged and, therefore, clearly in law shewed that the prisoner was not guilty; or Reg. v. Healey,[4] where a verdict of guilty of murder had added thereto, that there was no evidence to shew malice aforethought and premeditation, which was found too ambiguous to allow judgment to pass upon it. The foundation of the conviction was taken away.\nThis finding without intent or malicious intent does not meet the case and mean acquittal, where a man may be found guilty without intent of any kind, nay, as in the Queen v. Latimer,[5] against the actual intentions of the accused.\nAs to the instructions given the jury by the learned judge, I do not think that so far as he went they contained error of law; but I think he ought to have gone further and explained to the jury the three alternatives open to them upon such an indictment as was preferred here.\nI think, though no statutory requirement may exist in regard to this, in respect of more than one or two specified cases, that proper practice requires a verdict of acquittal, where that is intended, in respect of the higher offence as laid, and a conviction found in respect of the lower, just as if there had been two counts in the indictment dealing respectively with each charge.\nIn regard to that, however, Latham v. The Queen[6] shews that even where there were separate counts the omission of a finding on the first count did not prevent the judgment going on an appropriate finding of guilty on, or applicable to, a subsequent count.\nThat shows that what was omitted to be done here would not vitiate the proceedings so as to render the conviction liable to be quashed.\nI may point out that much of the interesting argument addressed to this court is in light of sections 743 and 745 no longer valid, and that cases such as this are governed by these much wider provisions than prevailed so late as Reg. v. Gibson,[7] which, however, as indicated in the opinion of the court there a right beyond what was contended for here, in regard to what could be looked at, to interpret the proceedings calle [Illegible Text]n question.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John J.

C.R. 160) that the inner harbour of Boston, Mass., is not a narrow channel within the meaning of said rule.\nAppeal from a decision of the local judge for the New Brunswick Admiralty District of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe following statement of the facts is taken from the judgment of Mr. Justice McLeod, local judge for the New Brunswick Admiralty Division.\n\"This is an action brought by William J. Lovitt, owner of the British barque \"Reform,\" against the steamer \"Calvin Austin\" for damages caused by a collision which occurred in what is known as the Boston inner harbour.\n\"The \"Calvin Austin\" is an American steamer of about twenty-eight hundred tons register.\n\"The barque \"Reform\" is a steel vessel, British register, of about 545 tons, and was just terminating a voyage from Rosario via Buenos Ayres to Boston with a cargo of wool and hide clippings when the collision occurred.\n\"The steamer \"Calvin Austin\" is a passenger steamer running between the ports of Boston and St. John, and at the time of the collision she was just leaving Boston for St. John. The collision happened in the Boston inner harbour on the 30th of July, 1903, at about 15 minutes past 12 o'clock in the day. The dock which the \"Calvin Austin\" used in Boston is known as the \"Commercial\" dock, and is on the south side of the harbour. On the 30th of July she left her dock a few minutes after 12 o'clock noon. 12 o'clock is her time for sailing, but she was a few minutes late leaving that day. The pilot, Captain Mitchell, says she came out of her dock, and when she left the dock (that is, when she was clear of the dock) it was 10 minutes past 12 o'clock. Shortly before she left the dock but just as she was preparing to leave a five-masted schooner, the \"Yan Aliens Boughton,\" in tow of the tug 'J. S. Chandler,\" passed down the harbour. The length of hawser between the tug and the schooner was about 75 fathoms. Shortly afterwards and immediately before she in fact left her dock a fishing schooner in tow of the tug \"William J. Williams\" came out of her dock just below the \"Commercial\" dock, on the same side of the harbour, a dock known as the \"T dock,\" and proceeded down the harbour. The length of hawser between the tug and fishing schooner was about 40 or 50 fathoms. There were vessels anchored on both sides of the harbour, that is, on both the north and south sides of the harbour or channel. The day was fine and clear, but there was a strong south-west or west-south-west wind blowing. The \"Van Aliens Boughton,\" in tow of the tug \"Chandler,' was going down about the centre of the harbour or channel, or possibly a little to the southern or starboard side going out. The fishing schooner, in tow of the tug \"Williams\", was following the \"Van Aliens Boughton\" down, a little on her starboard side. When the \"Calvin Austin\" came out of her dock she came clear out free from the dock, some of the witnesses say a length and a half or two lengths\u2014one witness gives a shorter distance\u2014but, at all events, when she got clear of the dock her helm was put hard a-port. She took a south-east course, which would take her down the harbour, and when she came on her course she was rather on the port side of the \"Van Aliens Boughton.\"\n\"The\" Calvin Austin,\" when she took her course of south-east, was \"going faster than the \"Van Aliens Boughton\" or the fishing schooner. She was probably three lengths behind the \"Van Aliens Boughton,'' and so far as I can gather from the evidence was just commencing to pass the fishing schooner but was some two or three hundred feet from her port side. Among the vessels anchored on the north side of the harbour was a barque, the \"Davis P. Davis,\" that appeared to be anchored a little outside the line of vessels so that her bow projected somewhat farther out in the harbour than the other vessels. When the \"Calvin Austin\" was straightened on her course she gave a signal of two whistles. Captain Pike, of the \"Calvin Austin,\" says they were given to the tug \"Williams\", having the fishing schooner in tow. At the time those whistles were given the \"Calvin Austin\" had commenced to pass the fishing schooner\u2014one of the witnesses says she had in fact passed the schooner.\n\"From all the evidence she was at all events passing the schooner when the whistles were given and was some two hundred feet on her port side and about two lengths or two lengths and a half behind the \"Van Aliens Boughton.\" The whistles were answered by the \"Williams\" towing the fishing schooner, by the \"Chandler\" towing the \"Van Aliens Boughton,\" and the \"Pallas\" towing the \"Reform.\"Capt. Pike says he heard the answer of the \"Williams\", but did not hear the other two. A few minutes after this signal was given, and Capt. Pike says after he had passed the tug of the fishing schooner and without any further signal being given, the helm of the \"Calvin Austin\" was passed hard a-port and she crossed the stem of the \"Van Aliens Boughton,\" and attempted to pass her on her starboard side and as she came on the starboard quarter of the \"Van Aliens Boughton\" she met the \"Reform\" in tow of the tug \"Pallas\", coming up on that side and ran into her about a-midship, striking her about a foot abaft of the fore rigging breaking a number of her plates and doing a good deal of damage.\n\"The pilot of the \"Calvin Austin\" says she left the wharf at ten minutes past twelve, that is when she swung clear of the wharf it was ten minutes past twelve and the collision occurred at fifteen minutes past twelve, five minutes later.\n\"The \"Reform\" was coming into Boston that day, and some distance outside of the Boston light she took the tug Pallas, and shortly after the pilot came on board and took charge. The tug first took her in tow on a hawser about one hundred feet long and they proceeded thus to the Boston light, passing through what is called the Narrows at the entrance of the harbour, past Castle Island, until they came about to what is called \"Burnham's Channel\" buoy. There they stopped and took in the hawser and the tug dropped down alongside the barque and made fast on her port side. The wharf she was going to is what is known as the \"Cunard wharf\" on the north side of the harbour, or nearly opposite the \"Commercial\" wharf,and the captain of the tug says he went on the port side as it would be handier to put her into her wharf on that side. She would lie with her starboard to the wharf. As they were taking in the hawser the tug \"Chandler\", with the \"Van Aliens Boughton\" in tow, was coining down the harbour or channel, and she gave two whistles to the Pallas, indicating that she wished to pass starboard to starboard. This was answered by the \"Pallas\" consenting. She then was made fast alongside the barque and they proceeded up the harbour on the south or port side at about two or two and a half knots an hour. Just after the tug was made fast alongside of the \"Reform\" the first two whistles of the \"Calvin Austin\" were heard and were answered by the \"Pallas\" consenting to meet starboard to starboard, those aboard the \"Pallas\" saying they supposed the signal was intended for them. The \"Reform\" in tow of the Pallas proceeded up the south side of the harbour or channel and when she was passing the \"Van Aliens Boughton\" the \"Calvin Austin\" came across the stern of the \"Van Aliens Boughton\" and the collision occurred. The \"Calvin Austin\" as she came on the starboard quarter of the \"Van Aliens Boughton\" and saw the \"Reform,'' again gave two whistles, put her helm hard to port and her engines full speed astern. The \"Pallas\" answered with two whistles. The helm of the \"Reform\" was put hard to port and the engines of the \"Pallas\" full speed astern, but the vessels came together and the damage occurred as stated.\"\nThe learned judge held that the \"Calvin Austin\" was solely to blame for the collision and gave judgment accordingly, assessing the damages at $9,059.61.\nThe questions at issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgment of the court delivered by Mr. Justice Davies.\nStockton K.C. for the appellant.\nH. H. McLean K.C. and Edward S. Dodge (of the Bar of the State of Massachusetts), for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nDavies J.\u2014This was an action brought in the Admiralty Court of the City of Saint John, N. B., by the respondent, the owner of the barkentine \"Reform\" against the SS. \"Calvin Austin\" for damages caused by the collision of the two ships in the inner harbour of Boston, Mass.\nBy agreement of the parties the damages were fixed, in case the \"Calvin Austin\" was found solely liable, at $9,059.61, for which amount the local judge in admiralty gave judgment.\nThe main contest on the appeal was as to the application and construction of articles 25 and 27 of the regulations for preventing collisions prescribed and enacted by the Congress of the United States relating to the navigation of all harbours, rivers and inland waters of the United States, certain ones specially named excepted of which Boston is not one. These two articles or regulations are as follows:\u2014\nNARROW CHANNELS.\nArt. 25. In narrow channels every steam-vessel shall, when it is safe and practicable, keep to that side of the fair-way or mid-channel which lies on the starboard side of such vessel.\nGeneral Prudential Rule.\nArt. 27. In obeying and construing these rules due regard shall be had to all dangers of navigation and collision, and to any special circumstances which may render a departure from the above rules necessary in order to avoid immediate danger.\nThe appellant, the \"Calvin Austin,\" contended that the inner harbour of Boston was a \"narrow channel\" within the meaning of the words in rule 25, and that the barkentine \"Reform\" and her tug boat the Pallas were guilty of a direct breach of that rule in coming into and sailing along \"that side of the fair-way or mid-channel of that inner harbour lying on the port side of such vessel\" and that no \"circumstances\" were proved under the articles making such a course of navigation and breach of the rule excusable.\nThe respondent submitted that the inner harbour of Boston, after passing inwardly the buoy, indifferently called the \"Gas Buoy\" or \"Buoy No. 9\", was not a \"narrow channel\" within the meaning of article 25, and, secondly, if it was, the circumstances proved fully justified the \"Reform\" and her tug in keeping to the southern side of that harbour.\nThe local judge in admiralty, Mr. Justice McLeod, held both contentions of the respondent well founded. We are of the opinion that he was right on both points.\nAs regards the main question, whether the inner harbour of Boston, at the point where the collision occured, was a \"narrow channel\" within the meaning of the words of article 25, we have carefully read the evidence relative to the harbour, its configuration, its buoys, its depth, its dredging, its docks, and its entrance channel, and examined most carefully the charts shewing all these important facts, and we are of the opinion that neither the language nor the reason of the rule are properly applicable to this inner harbour. As it appears from the chart, the line of the inner harbour forms a kind of semi-circle and is almost entirely lined with docks and wharves.\nThe depth of water from the docks on the north side to those on the south side, and from those on the west to the place of the collision, nearly out to the Gas Buoy, is practically uniform. There is no fair-way or mid-channel in this inner harbour to which the words of the rule could apply or by which ships sailing in it could be guided. When vessels reach this inner harbour they either anchor under the direction of the harbour master or proceed straight to their dock or wharf wherever that is in North, South or West Boston. The waters in front of these docks are used as anchorage grounds for vessels under the direction of the harbour master. Several small rivers run into this inner harbour but they do not affect the question now in consideration. From the Gas Buoy seawards the evidence and the charts shew there is what might be called a \"narrow channel\" in whole or in part. Its depth and width are more or less defined and it is marked by buoys the greater part of the way. It is not necessary for us, however, to decide whether this channel from the sea to the Gas Buoy, or any part of it, is or is not a \"narrow channel.\" What we have to determine is whether the inner harbour inside of these buoys, at the place where the collision occurred, is such a channel, and we hold it is not.\nThe object of the rule is to prevent collisions by keeping steamers on the proper side of narrow channels though which they steam. It is a reasonable and necessary rule for such waters but we cannot see reason or object in its application to such a place as this inner harbour. Surrounded except at its entrance from the sea by docks and wharves, having practically a uniform depth of water, and not having either a natural fairway or mid-channel or an artificially buoyed one to indicate to vessels the side of the fair-way which would lie on their starboard side, we cannot see how article 25 could reasonably be applicable to it.\nThis conclusion would practically decide the case because, if the \"Reform\" was being towed where she was at the time of the collision properly and not in violation of the rule, it was not really arguable that she had been guilty of faults or neglect which would bring her within the rule of contributory negligence.\nIn deference, however, to the able argument of Dr. Stockton that the \"Calvin Austin\" was not shewn to have been guilty of any positive fault either in the steam signals she gave before the collision took place or otherwise in her navigation, we have given special attention to the evidence upon these points. We fully agree with the trial judge that the steamer was distinctly to blame for the misleading steam signals or whistles she gave and that these signals directly led up to the collision. They were heard and answered by the tug of the \"Reform\" amongst other vessels and properly acted upon by them and the subsequent wrongful navigation of the \"Calvin Austin\" at variance with those signals given by herself, was the proximate cause of the collision for which she must be held answerable.\nWe are unable to find, considering the circumstances of the time, place and weather conjoined with the signals from the \"Calvin Austin\" that the \"Reform\" was guilty of any negligence for which she should be held liable in whole or in part.\nConcurring as we substantially do with the reasoning and the conclusions of the learned trial judge on the main questions we do not think it necessary to support our judgment with reference to the evidence as these references are all given in the trial judge's judgment.\nThe appeal will be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John Kerr.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H. F. Puddington.\n[1] 9 Ex. C R. 160.\n",

When secured work\" men stood on the staging and nailed planks to the sides of the bin. The planks were run along a tramway at the side of the bins by rollers and thrown off to the side of the bin farthest from the tramway. While two men on the top of the bin were holding up the staging until it could be secured, a plank on top of the adjoining pile fell off. In falling it hit the men on top of the bin and they were precipitated to the bottom and one of them killed. In an action by his widow against the contractor for building the elevator twenty-five questions were submitted to the jury and on their answers a verdict was entered for the plaintiff.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that while the falling of the plank caused the accident there was no finding that the same was due to the negligence of the defendant nor any that the death of deceased was due to negligence for which, under the evidence, defendant was responsible. Therefore, and because many of the questions submitted were irrelevant to the issue and may have confused the jury, there should be a new trial.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick maintaining the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff by an equal division of the judges.\nThe material facts which led to the death of the. plaintiff's husband are sufficiently stated in the above head-note and in the judgments given on this appeal. At the trial twenty-five questions were submitted to the jury which, with their answers thereto, were as follows:\n\"1. From which load on the tramway did the plank, which struck the deceased, fall,\u2014the load which Humphreys was handling, or the one next to it?\n\"A. The one next to it, directly over the bin where the men were raising stage.\n\"2. To what cause do you attribute the falling of the plank?\n\"A. To Humphreys throwing off plank.\n\"3. Was the system of appliances used by the defendant for the raising of the staging and holding it securely after being raised a safe and proper system for the purpose, having regard to the work to be accomplished and circumstances?\n\"A. Yes, after it was secured in place, but not otherwise.\n\"4. If not a safe and proper system for the purpose, wherein was it defective as to safety?\n\"A. The possibility of dogs dropping off.\n\"5. Was it equally as safe and proper as the system shown to be generally used for the like work or purpose in similar erections?\n\"A. When properly applied.\n\"6. If not equally as safe and proper as the system shown to be generally used, wherein does its inferiority in respect of safety consist?\n\"7. Was the defendant guilty of negligence in respect of the system of appliances provided for the raising and holding of the staging after being raised, and if yes, what negligence, and did that negligence cause or contribute to the death of the deceased Harris?\n\"A. Yes, 5. No, 2.\n\"8. Should the defendant have provided a supply of extra dogs oh the top of the bins, to be available in case of any dropping down, as a reasonable precaution for the safety of the stage raisers, and did the omission to provide such supply cause or contribute to the death of the deceased, and if so, how?\n\"A. Yes, and he should have informed the men of their whereabouts. Yes, 6. No, 1.\n\"9. Should the defendant have seen that the counterweights were at all times kept on the dogs, as a necessary part of the appliance for safely raising and securing the stage, and did the omission to do so cause or contribute to the death of the deceased?\n\"A. Yes, 6. No, 1.\n\"10. Was the tramway and its connections, as an appliance for distributing the lumber, in all parts essential for the protection and safety precaution for the stage raisers, the same as generally used for like work in building similar erections; or, if not, was there any material difference, affecting the safety of the appliance, and if there was, wherein did such difference consist and how did it affect the safety of the appliance?\n\"A. Yes.\n\"11. Assuming the appliances to be all that reasonable precaution for the stage raisers' safety would require, did the method or system of using those appliances protect the stage raisers at the time of the stage raising, that is to say, take all reasonable precaution for their safety?\n\"A. No.\n\"12. Would reasonable precaution for the safety of the stage raisers require that in the distribution of the lumber there should be no handing down or throwing of plank from off the tramway opposite or in close proximity to bins where and when stage raising was going on, or not, having regard to the work to be accomplished and other existing conditions and circumstances?\n\"A. Yes.\n\"13. Would reasonable precaution for the stage raisers' safety while stage raising, permit of the handing down or throwing of lumber from off the tramway opposite or in close proximity to bins where stage raising was going on, the handing down or throwing being to the other side of the tramway from that on which the stage raising was going on, if due care was exercised in the handing down or throwing off, having regard to the work to be accomplished and the existing conditions and circumstances?\n\"A. No.\n\"14. Did the defendant employ a sufficient number of men for the proper performance of the work in its various departments or branches? If not, in what respect was he negligent therein, and did such negligence cause or contribute to the death of the deceased Harris; and if so, how?\n\"A. No\u2014by not having enough men on tramway.\n\"15. Did the defendant use all reasonable precautions for the protection of the stage raisers? If not, in what respect did he fail to do so?\n\"A. No. By allowing plank to be thrown off at or near stage raising.\n\"16. Did the defendant take reasonable care to provide proper appliances, and so to carry on his operations as not to subject those employed by him to unnecessary risk?\n\"A. No, 6. Yes, 1.\n\"17. If you answer \"no\" to the last question, then was the want of reasonable care in not providing proper appliances, or in carrying on his operations, or both? Was it through such want of reasonable care that the accident occurred to the deceased by which he lost his life?\n\"A. It was. Yes, 6. No, 1.\n\"18. Were the several men employed by the defendant in their respective positions, so far as was reasonably necessary, experienced or instructed for the duties they had to perform? If not, in what respect was the defendant negligent therein, and did such negligence cause or contribute to the death of the deceased Harris, and if so, how?\n\"A. Yes, the men were experienced, but not sufficiently instructed.\n\"19. Did the defendant personally control and direct the method of using the appliances, to the extent of authorizing the throwing lumber off the tramway opposite or in close proximity to the stage raisers when at work stage raising, and to the other side of the tramway?\n\"A. Yes.\n\"20. Did the defendant direct the particular manner of taking the loads off the slings, placing them on the rollers, conveying them to the place of removal from tram, and mode of handing down or throwing off, as it was done; or did he leave the manner of so doing to the men who had the work to do?\n\"A. Yes.\n\"21. \"Was the manner of taking the loads off the slings, placing them on the rollers, conveying them to the place of removal from tram, and mode of handing down or throwing off, safe and proper? If not, in what respect was the manner of so doing unsafe or improper; and did it contribute and if yes, in what way did it contribute, to the death of the deceased Harris?\n\"A. No\u2014not having men in the distribution.\n\"22. Were all parts of the work as carried on by the several workmen in their respective positions so carried on with the approval and by the direction or authority of the defendant, both as to what they did and the manner of doing their work? If not, in what work and what respect was the approval, direction or authority of the defendant absent?\n\"A. Yes.\n\"23. Was due care exercised in receiving the loads from the sling, placing the same on the tramway from which the plank fell on the deceased, transmitting the same to the place of unloading, and in unloading same off the train? If not, in what respect was due care not taken and who omitted to take due care therein; and was such want of due care in any way the cause of the plank falling from the tram?\n\"A Can't answer.\n\"24. Did the defendant so hurry and overwork the men, or any of them, who had the work to do mentioned in the last question, or any part of it, that they could not, or had not time to, perform their work otherwise than as they did?\n\"A. Yes.\n'25. Did the deceased know of the existence of the risk, that is, the danger of accident happening to him in the work he entered upon, as the whole work was carried on, did he appreciate the danger, or have the means of appreciating it, and take upon himself the risk?\n\"A. No.\n\"26. What damages do you find by way of fair compensation to the wife of the deceased for the pecuniary loss resulting to her from the death of her husband?\n\"A. Twelve hundred and fifty dollars. ($1,250.00).\nOn these findings a verdict was entered for the plaintiff for the damages assessed by the jury. An application to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick for a new trial was unsuccessful the court being equally divided and the verdict consequently stood.\nPugsley K. C. and A. G. Blair, jr., for the appellant.\nMullin K. C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nNesbitt J.\u2014The majority of the court are of the opinion that a new trial should be granted in this case.\nWe fully recognize the principle that if the verdict could fairly be supported upon any evidence upon which reasonable men might come to a conclusion in its favour that it should not be set aside because the appellate court did not agree with the conclusions reached. We also fully agree that answers by a jury to questions should be given the fullest possible effect, and, if it is possible to support the same by any reasonable construction, they should be supported. It must, however, be borne in mind that where it is felt there has been a confusion of the issues at the trial and it is doubtful whether the attention of the jury was given to the real point in issue and the questions answered or unanswered because the jury say \"can't answer\" leave the real question in controversy in doubt and ambiguity, the cause of justice is best promoted by a new trial. Unless the answers given by the jury to the questions as a whole or to one or more of the questions fairly indicate a finding that the death of the workmen was proximately caused by some specific or definite act of negligence for which the defendant is answerable he cannot be held liable. Any number of findings of want of reasonable care in providing or using proper appliances for the work the defendant was engaged in constructing, could not justify the court in entering a verdict against the defendant unless there was a direct finding, or it must be irresistibly inferred from the findings made, that this negligence or want of care was the direct and proximate cause of the accident That is the difficulty we find here.\nThere appears to be no reasonable doubt that it was the falling of the plank which caused the accident. But there is no finding that this falling of the plank was caused by the respondent's negligence, and, although we have subjected the multitudinous and somewhat conflictory findings of the jury to the most searching analysis, we have been unable to conclude as a result that there has been a substantial finding on what seems to us to be the crucial point of the case; in fact we find it impossible in the conflict of actual findings and the confessed inability of the jury to answer question 23, to say that there has been any finding as to the proximate cause of the accident on which a verdict could be entered.\nWe desire to offer as few observations as possible lest either of the parties might be prejudiced on a new trial. It is necessary, however, to indicate what we think is the real issue between the parties.\nThe learned trial judge submitted some twenty-five questions many of them of great length and several of them containing distinct inquiries each necessitating an answer. In addition to this a great many of the questions are directed towards allegations of negligence which, in our opinion, have no bearing upon the issue. On the evidence before us it may well be argued that the proximate cause of the accident was the falling of a plank upon the deceased while he was engaged in the act of raising the stage, and that questions as to whether the system of stage raising adopted by the defendant took a somewhat shorter or longer time than the systems adopted elsewhere, are not pertinent. The peril involved in a plank striking one of those engaged in the operation of raising the stage must exist according to the evidence for a short space of time, no matter what system of stage raising is adopted, and an injustice might be done if, in applying the doctrine of negligence to a case of this sort, the maxim causa proxima et non remota spectalur were lost sight of. The negligence, if any, must have consisted, under the circumstances, in the throwing off of planks in the immediate neighbourhood of the men engaged in the act of stage-raising; and the throwing off or falling off of the plank at that particular period of time, if found to be negligence and the direct and immediate cause of the damage, would determine the defendant's liability. No evidence, establishing that if some other method of stage-raising had been adopted, the men at the particular moment when the plank fell might have had the stage-raising completed and thus the fatal accident been avoided, is pertinent. Had the stage-raising a little lower down in the same bin, at an earlier moment, taken even longer, then the men at the particular moment when this plank fell would have been at their ordinary work instead of being engaged in stage-raising.\nThis is not dissimilar from the class of cases where it is urged that if a train had been going faster it would have been past the spot where the accident occurred and that, therefore, speed is not negligence.\nWe think that all the questions relating to counterweights and dogs and staging were unnecessary.\nThe jury have found, in answer to questions 7 and 9, that the defendant's failure to see that counterweights were at all times kept on the dogs caused or contributed to the death of the deceased. They have also found that not having enough men on the tramway likewise caused or contributed to the death of the deceased. They have also found that by allowing planks to be thrown off at or near stage-raising the defendant failed to use reasonable precautions for the protection of stage-raisers, but not that it was the cause of the accident. They have said that they are unable to answer whether there was anything negligent either in placing planks upon the tramway or in transmitting them to the place of unloading or in unloading them. This, apparently, conflicts with the answer to question 15. They have not expressly found that the negligence of throwing off planks caused the death, but have simply found that reasonable precaution would have required that such a system be not adopted. We are, therefore, unable to say that the jury have found any negligence causing the death for which, in our opinion, the defendant, on the evidence, can be said to be liable.\nWe think that, assuming the tramway to be proper and assuming that the planks are properly placed upon it, and assuming that due care is exercised in unloading the planks, if the plaintiff is able to satisfy the jury by evidence that the defendant reasonably ought to have foreseen that accidents might occur from the throwing off of planks near to the men engaged in stage-raising (even upon the opposite side of the tramway) the defendant would be answerable for such negligence.\nIt is quite evident that the personal supervision of the work was done by him and he was aware of the method of carrying on the work See Sword v. Cameron[1] affirmed in Smith v. Baker[2]. Upon this essential part of the case the learned trial judge charged the jury as follows: You will bear the fact of the two accidents in your minds throughout the case, if you please, when you are considering what would reasonably be required of the defendant; because he would not have more than a knowledge of the possibility, or probability, as the case may be, of either one of these accidents happening, and still less would he he likely to have it in his mind that two accidents would be apt to occur at the same moment. He would in regard to the tramway and the unloading of the lumber from the tramway, I think, and I think any reasonable man would be apt to have in his mind, and the jury would expect him to have in his mind, the possibility of lumber falling from the tramway; but he would not be likely to have in bis mind, nor do I think he ought reasonably to be held likely to have in his mind that the floor upon which that deal would fall would be other than a stage covered bin. I think it would be expecting a man to foresee possibilities to a greater extent than a jury would be likely to expect him to foresee if they held him to anticipate the occurrence of those two accidents together in the falling of the deal upon the man when he was in the act of raising staging and when the bin was exposed so that he could go to the bottom. And I think there have been some references given to his duty in regard to there not having been plank put clown if there was a dangerous condition of the bin below, from the fact that it seems the instructions always forbade the throwing off of lumber from the tramway on to bins where stage-raising was in fact going on.\nWe cannot find the evidence went this length but point to it as shewing that the attention of the jury was not closely drawn to what we conceive to be the vital point in issue.\nWe are unable to say what the evidence may be upon a new trial, but we think that the jury should be made clearly to understand that no matter how perfect the system be, if the defendant, as a reasonable man, should have apprehended that the method adopted in carrying out the system might lead to an accident under particular circumstances, he is liable if the accident occurs under those circumstances. We do not think that the jury's mind should be distracted and embarrassed by questions relating to the different methods of the system of stage-raising; it is common to both systems that at some particular moment the men should be engaged in stage-raising, and the point to be determined is whether or not the defendant was negligent in allowing planks to be thrown off in the way this plank was thrown off at such a time and place, no matter how carefully the operation is carried on. If there is no evidence whatever from which a jury might infer that such a contingency ought reasonably to have been apprehended by the defendant, then the trial judge would probably think that there was no evidence to go before the jury under the doctrines enunciated by this court in Wood v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[3], following the authorities therein referred to.\nWe would suggest that, upon a new trial, the jury be simply asked:\u2014 Was the defendant guilty of negligence causing the death of deceased, and if so, in what did such negligence consist?\nWe regret the necessity of a new trial and that the appeal must be allowed and with costs, as we feel that any other order as to costs would be a departure from principle and laying down a dangerous precedent.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant in erecting an elevator which had reached at the time when the accident now in question happened about sixty-five feet in height, used for the purpose of the distribution of the planks needed in the construction of the elevator, a system of rollers two feet long set transversely across a tramway that extended four inches beyond the ends of the rollers.\nThis tramway extended alongside the range of bins that were being made of various sizes from four by eight to twelve by fourteen feet, or some such sizes. These bins were built open from the bottom clear to the top. The planks used to form the sides of these bins were being nailed together by a large number of men. The men engaged in nailing together the planks forming these bins stood upon a stage set in each bin. This stage was from time to time as building progressed moved up by four men standing on the wall of the bin, each pulling a rope attached to the stage at or near the corner of it and, as it was drawn up, there was an appliance called a dog that fell, or was intended to fall, into a notch in the wall of the bin and support the stage when it had reached the point where the men needed it set to proceed with the work.\nThe plaintiff's husband, whilst engaged in the moving of this stage in the manner I refer to, was struck by a plank falling from the tramway which would be some few feet above where he stood, and by force of the blow knocked into the bin and thrown to the bottom along with another workman who was trying to fix one of the dogs needed for the support of this stage. The plaintiff's husband, as the result of this fall of sixty-five feet, was killed.\nIt seems he had been kept standing in this strained position for a longer time than he need otherwise have been had the dog been at hand to be put into its place. It had dropped off as it was apt to do and time was lost recovering it. As it happened to have been recovered and got back to the place where the man placing it was engaged in doing so, I do not just now attach the importance to the question of its falling out that seems to have been done at the trial by all parties.\nSuffice it to say that it became the duty of the deceased in the course of his serving the defendant to help to hold this movable staging and to stand, whilst doing so, in the perilous place he did, on top of a narrow wall sixty-five feet high.\nHe was entitled in law at the hands of the defendant in the discharge of so risky a duty to the reasonable safeguards that a prudent careful man under the circumstances must have seen necessary for the purpose of protecting one of his servants so placed. It seems that the tramway might be seven feet above the workmen at one time and again only three or four feet above them, that height depending entirely upon the progress of the work of construction. Upon this tramway a man would place the needed planks when elevated, and so place them that there might be three tiers alongside each other, consisting of seven two-inch planks in depth.\nThus piled they could be moved along upon and by means of the rollers to the point needed. There would be three of these piles in succession, and propelling one after the other would bring their ends into contact and, if much force directly applied or acquired from momentum of motion, might crowd them upon each other so as to overlap or interlap each other.\nWhen this happened as there was only one man working at throwing off the load he might, though working with care, disturb these planks on the load beyond where he was working.\nThe act of moving these piles would also sometimes disintegrate the load and tend to throw it or part of it off on the men below.\nAny disturbance of these planks was liable to pro. duce a fall of some of them.\nThat fall might take place just at the unfortunate moment when the men engaged in raising the stage had their hands full and stood in the place of greatest danger in prosecuting their work.\nThe evidence shows that within two weeks prior to the accident in question planks falling from these piles on the tramway had knocked down two different men engaged beside and below the material thus piled from which such falling took place, and at least on three other occasions there were observed similar occurrences of falling planks. All this was apparently not due to carelessness but would seem to have been a necessary incident of operating the narrow, unguarded appliances in use for distributing this timber, and was something one would say who had never seen similar appliances in operation as most likely to happen. Operated a few feet from the ground, it was not likely to produce serious results. Indeed, when the staging was in its place and the men had that to stand upon and a chance to protect themselves, fatal accidents might seem improbable. But when known to happen or to be likely to happen, the question arises if in running the chance of its doing so, at such a critical moment as that now in question, can be aught but negligence on the defendant's part.\nIt has been established by the evidence of the defendant and his witnesses that this system and these appliances were in charge of most careful men, warned to take every care for the safety of themselves and others, and yet there happened in the operation of this system and these appliances so guarded, within a fortnight or so preceding the accident in question, five different accidents of the same nature as this in so far as lumber falling off from this tram is concerned upon men at work or in the immediate vicinity of the men at work but so placed as to escape the like misfortune of deceased at the time of this the sixth falling of lumber from the tram piles.\nIf that could happen then and there under such circumstances, I think beyond any question that there was such a condition of things then existing in the defendant's works where deceased was employed as might, and in the language used in this court in Wood v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[4] could, reasonably have been foreseen to be likely to endanger the safety of the defendant's servants\nworking under or beside such tramway whilst in use where such servants were working.\nThen there is evidence in express terms that there might have been more precaution taken and that there was no proper care taken; that lumber had been known to fall from cars when in use in defendant's service, on the tramway, and that the almost self-evident safe-guards of outriggers involving a trifling expense might have been applied but was not, and that there could have been greater safety by use of two men instead of one, and that the defendant not only insisted upon one man doing the work of two or where two might have been employed but also pressed the one so much as to induce hasty action, adding thus to the perils of the men by increasing risk of lumber falling off and that if there was undue haste on Humphrey's part it was the act of the defendant who directed it.\nI am not concerned beyond the determination of the question whether or not there existed such evidence of this danger and of the neglect to provide against it as to render it the duty of the trial judge to submit the evidence to the jury, the proper tribunal to pass upon it. If I cannot find that, by reason of this evidence falling short of that, the action should have been dismissed, I am in law bound by the verdict of the jury.\nThis is elementary law\u2014it needs no argument to uphold it.\nThere was no objection made at the trial to the learned judge's charge or any of his questions that he submitted or to the number thereof. None can be made now.\nThe only remaining question is what is the meaning of the verdict? Is there enough in it to entitle the plaintiff to have judgment? They find that the plank which struck the deceased fell from the load next to one Humphreys was handling and directly over the bin where the men were raising the stage and attributable to Humphreys's throwing off the plank, and answer questions Nos. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19, as follows:\u2014\n11. Assuming the appliances to be all that reasonable precaution for the stage-raisers safety would require, did the method or system of using those appliances protect the stage-raisers at the time of the stage-raising, that is to say, take all reasonable precaution for their safety?\nA. No.\n12. Would reasonable precaution for the safety of the stage-raisers require that in the distribution of the lumber there should be no handing down or throwing of plank from off the tramway opposite or in close proximity to bins where and when stage-raising was going on, or not, having regard to the work to be accomplished and other existing conditions and circumstances?\nA. Yes.\n13. Would reasonable precaution for the stage-raisers' safety while stage-raising, permit of the handing down or throwing of lumber from off the tramway opposite or in close proximity to bins where stage-raising was going on, the handing down or throwing being to the other side of the. tramway from that on which the stage-raising was going on, if due care was exercised in the handing down or throwing off, having regard to the work to be accomplished and the existing conditions and circumstances?\nA. No.\n14. Did the defendant employ a sufficient number of men for the proper performance of the work in its various departments or branches? If not, in what respect was he negligent therein, and did such negligence cause or contribute to the death of deceased Harris; and, if so, how?\nA. No, by not having enough men on tramway.\n15. Did the defendant use all reasonable precautions for the protection of the stage-raisers? if not, in what respect did he fail to do so?\nA. No. By allowing plank to be thrown off at or near stage-raising.\n16. Did the defendant take reasonable care to provide proper appliances and so to carry on his operations as not to subject those employed by him to unnecessary risk?\nA. No, 6. Yes, 1.\n17. If you answer \"No\" to the last question, then was there want of reasonable care in not providing proper appliances, or in carrying on his operations, or both? Was it through such want of reasonable care that the accident occurred o the deceased by which he lost his life?\nA. It was. Yes, 6. No, 1. 18. Were the several men employed by the defendant in their respective positions, so far as was reasonably necessary, experienced or instructed for the duties they had to perform? If not, in what respect was the defendant negligent therein, and did such negligence cause or contribute to the death of the deceased Harris, and, if so, how?\nA. Yes. The men were experienced, but not sufficiently instructed.\n19. Did the defendant personally control and direct the method of using the appliances, to the extent of authorizing the throwing lumber off the tramway opposite or in close proximity to the stage-raisers when at work stage-raising, and to the other side of the tramway?\nA. Yes.\nI am unable to see any difficulty in understanding what the jury intended by these answers when I bear in mind, as I must, the subject matter in relation to which they were asked, the evidence given and the learned judge's charge thereon to which no objection was taken and that counsel for defendant made no objection to any of these questions. There was and is no manner of doubt that deceased met his death by reason of the falling from the tramway of a plank, that knocked him and his comrade, whilst engaged in stage-raising, down into a pit sixty-five feet deep.\nThe questions Nos. 16 and 17 and answers thereto would alone be sufficiently comprehensive and accurate, under the circumstances, to convey to the mind of the court that the deceased met his death by reason of the defendant not taking reasonable care to provide proper appliances and carry on therewith his operations in which his late servant was engaged; and the answer to the 19th question attributes this to the defendant personally or as done under his personal control and direction.\nAn over-refinement in framing so many questions may seem at first sight perplexing. In the answers that the jury have given I think they shew clearly that they successfully overcame everything that was thus so apparently perplexing, and made their meaning clear in spite thereof. I do not think that we should, by over-refining, fritter away their plain meaning. It is much more clearly shewn, I submit, than in some other verdicts such as Moore v. The Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co.[5]; Balfour v. The Toronto Railway Co.[6]; Seaton v. Burnand[7]; and O'Connor v. The Hamilton Bridge Co.[8], where verdicts had to be extracted from some apparently inconsistent or inconclusive answers and yet were upheld in most of these instances by this court.\nCounsel for the defendant, in opening his defence, said, referring to the contentions by counsel for plaintiff: \"He says that the defendant is guilty of negligence in that he did not supply or provide a suitable or safe tramway\u2014in other words a perfect system of tramway. He says that the defendant is guilty of negligence in that he did not provide a safe and secure system of staging; and the third allegation is that he is guilty of negligence in that the method of operating the said system was defective. I may say to you that if the plaintiff could establish\u2014could substantiate these allegations, then I apprehend that we could not very well ask you to do other than bring in a verdict for the plaintiff.''\nThe jury have, upon the evidence which was upon each of these issues sufficient to entitle them to do so, found each of the allegations in question well founded, and yet we are asked to grant a new trial.\nThe issue as to the safe and secure system of staging I have not dealt with separately though questions were submitted in regard to it and were answered favourably to the plaintiff.\nThe security and safety of that system is covered sufficiently for the purposes of the trial in question by those answers I have quoted. Much more than need have been, I think, was gone into at the trial on this head but possibly the doing so was unavoidable, and certainly the defendant cannot say after (so to speak), joining issue thereon in the address I have quoted from, that he was embarrassed by it.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Blair & Blair.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Daniel Mullin.\n[1] 1 Ct. of Sess.

In the meantime the lands were acquired by the defendants and patent rights were assigned to them, in trust for the syndicate, and the lands and patent rights were to be transferred to the syndicate or to the company without any consideration gave the allotment of shares proportionately to the interest of the parties. The stock in the proposed company was to be allotted, having in view the proprietary rights and moneys contributed by the syndicate members, in proportion as follows, 37\u00bd per cent to the defendants who held the property, 32\u00bd per cent to the owners of the patent rights, the other three members to receive each 10 per cent of the total stock. A time limit was fixed within which the company was to be formed and, in default of its incorporation within that time, the lands were to remain the property of the defendants, the transfers of the patent rights were to become void and all parties were to be in the same position as if the agreement had never been made. The tenth clause of the agreement provided that, in case of difference of opinion, three-fourths in value should control. Owing to differences in opinion, the proposed company was not formed but, within the time limited, the plaintiff, and the other two members, holding together 30 per cent interest in the syndicate, caused a company to be incorporated for the development and exploitation of the enterprise and demanded that the property and rights should be transferred to it under the agreement. This being refused, the plaintiff brought action against the trustees for specific performance of the agreement to convey the lands and transfer the patent rights to the company, so incorporated, or for damages.\nHeld, that the tenth clause of the agreement controlled the administration of the affairs of the syndicate and that, as three-fourths in value of the members had not joined in the formation of a company, as proposed, within the time limited, the lands remained the property of the defendants, the patent rights had reverted to their original owners and the plaintiff could not enforce specific performance.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, by which the plaintiffs action was dismissed with costs.\nThe following statement of the case made by Mr. Justice Hall, in his dissenting judgment, in the court below, was [referred to by Mr. Justice Blanchet, in delivering the judgment now appealed from, as a sufficient statement of the facts in controversy. Mr. Justice Hall said:\u2014\n\"The appellant's action was brought upon an agreement sous seing priv\u00e9 of date April 30th, 1900, to which the plaintiff and the defend ants and also Francis C. Crean, Gerald J. Crean, James Dobson and Charles Webb were parties. The appellant, Hopper, acquired, and now represents the interests of Dobson and Webb By this agreement a syndicate was formed for acquiring and developing certain lots in the Township of Duval, on the east side of the River Natashquan, in the Province of Quebec, containing deposits of iron sand. The Messrs. Crean were proprietors of letters patent for a magnetic separator by which the iron was to be separated from the sand.\n\" The preamble of this agreement of April 30th, 1900, sets forth that the respondents Hoctor and May have acquired the lots in question, that the appellant Hopper, and Dobson and Webb, have provided certain large sums of money, which have been expended in exploring for minerals upon the said properties, and in the examination of other properties in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Straits of Belle Isle, and in the construction of the electrical separator, etc., and that Gerald J. Crean, the owner of the patent for the separator, has transferred it to the respondent Hoctor, in trust for the syndicate formed by the agreement. Clause one of the agreement then continues as follows:\n\u20181. The parties of the first part hereby agree to transfer and convey in fee, to the syndicate composed of the parties hereto, or to the corporation to be formed or other nominee of such syndicate, the lots of land hereinabove described, free and clear of all encumbrance, without any consideration other than the share and interest of said parties in the said syndicate allotted to them as hereinafter set forth, together with all rights in the above mentioned patents transferred by the said Gerald J. Crean to Daniel Hoctor, in trust for the said syndicate, and ratified by Francis C. Crean, tutor of the said Gerald J. Crean.\u201d\n\u2018The second and third clauses of the agreement apportion the interests of the several parties in the following terms \u2014\n\u20182. Having taken fully into consideration all the sums of money expended by the parties hereto up to April 9, 1900, the parties agree now to readjust the interests in the said syndicate as of that date, neither party having any claim upon the other for past expenses for any reason whatever up to that date.\n3. The share and interest of the said parties in the p resent syndicate, and in its assets and rights, or in any corporation to be formed to take over its assets and rights, shall be as follows: \u2018Daniel Hoctor, eighteen and three-quarters per cent.\n\u2018Frank W. May, eighteen and three-quarters per cent.\n\u2018Francis C. Crean and Gerald J. Crean, thirty-two and a half per cent.\n\u2018Robert Thomas Hopper, ten per cent.\n\u2018James Dobson, ten per cent.\n\u2018Charles J. Webb, ten per cent.'\n\" Crean agrees to transfer to the syndicate, its successors or assigns, all further patents which he may obtain in Canada for inventions of a similar nature, and it is agreed that the members of the syndicate shall contribute whatever money is needed in the enterprise in proportion to their several interests.\n\" The seventh and eighth clauses, which are important, are in these words .\u2014\n' 7. It is agreed that on or before September 1, 1901, a corporation or joint stock company shall be formed by the syndicate for the development and exploration of the above mentioned properties, or any others that may be acquired under this agreement and the shares in the said corporation or joint stock company shall be allotted to the members in the syndicate in the proportion of their several interests as herein expressed.\n' 8. If the joint stock company shall not be formed before the first day of September, one thousand nine hundred and one, or, if after September 1, 1900, a majority in value notify the other members of the syndicate that they require the formation of such company, and for the space of two months after the receipt of such notice the minority members refuse to unite in forming such company, then the whole of the lands above mentioned shall revert to and become the property of the said Daniel Hoctor and Frank W. May; and any transfers made by the said Gerald J. Crean of his own patent or of any improvements thereof shall be void and of no effect, and all the parties shall be in the same position as if this contract had never been made, without any right to recover any moneys expended in connection with the syndicate after April 9th, 1900, except that any properties acquired by purchase by moneys contributed by members of the syndicate shall be sold and the net proceeds divided among those who contributed in the proportions of their contributions.'\n\" The tenth clause, which was relied upon at the argument by the respondents, declares that ' all matters affecting anything more than mere detail of administration shall first be approved by all of the syndicate, and in case of difference of opinion three-fourths in value shall control.'\n\u201c The parties did not agree upon the formation of a joint stock company. On the 11th May, 1901, by the ministry of Dunton, notary, the appellant, Hopper, specially called upon the respondents to unite in the formation of a joint stock company in accordance with the terms of the agreement, and notifying them that in default of their declaring their willingness to unite in forming such joint stock company the appellant would with others proceed to obtain letters patent of incorporation under the name of 'The Natashquan Iron Company.' The respondents would not unite with the appellant, who associated with himself certain others, and on the 13th August obtained incorporation under the name of ' The Natashquan Iron Company, and on the 28th August, by Derome, notary, appellant and the Natashquan Iron Company notified the respondents of the incorporation of the company and of their willingness to transfer shares in the company in pursuance of the agreement of April 30th, declaring the willingness of the appellant and the Natashquan Iron Company to enter into any agreement which would give effect to the syndicate contract of April 30th, 1900, calling upon the respondents, in the event of their refusing to accept shares in the said company, to forthwith transfer and convey the lands and mining lots and patent invention to the syndicate, in which the appellant, Hopper, owned thirty per cent, he having acquired the interests of Dobson and Webb. The respondents replied to the notarial notification of appellant that they were willing to unite in any company which could insure practical results and success, but made no suggestions as to what such a company should be.\n\" The appellant brought suit, asking that the respondents be ordered to transfer to the Natashquan Iron Company the lots in question, together with the patent for the separator, and alternatively that the judgment should go to transfer the property and patent to the syndicate in accordance with the terms of the agreement, and failing either of these remedies, that the respondents be condemned to pay the sum of $20,000 damages.\n\" The consideration set forth in the deed by which the respondents acquired the property, appears to be $5,570, though the respondent, May, swears that further sums were paid. The appellant and those whose interests he represents, contributed in cash $4,983 for which they acquired an interest of thirty per cent in the syndicate.\"\nHoctor and May contested this demand upon three grounds:\u2014.(1) that Hopper was not legally seized of the rights of Dobson and Webb, as he had not given proper notice of his purchase of their interests to the respondents; (2) that the Creans had not been called in the case, and that the conclusions of the action could not be granted so long as they were not made parties to it; and (3) that the Creans and themselves had always been willing to form a company, but had been unable to agree with Hopper as to the amount of its capital; that they had made repeated attempts to dispose of their rights. but had been unsuccessful, without any fault of theirs and sometimes through the opposition of Hopper; that the latter could not form a company without their consent, as they represented 70 per cent of its assets, and that they could not be forced to transfer their properties and rights in the patent to the company organized by him in contravention to the express terms of their agreement which says that the company shall be formed by the syndicate, and that, therefore, his demand in damages was unfounded in fact and in law.\nThe Superior Court dismissed the appellant's action upon two grounds; (1) because Francis C. Crean and Gerald J. Crean were not made defendants; and (2) because the time limit for the formation of a joint stock company had expired, and the intentions of the other members of the syndicate as to the formation of such a company were frustrated by the plaintiff, and the property had reverted to the respondents.\nThe majority of the judges in the court below did not adjudicate formally upon the two first objections\u00bb but came to the conclusion that the action must fail upon the third plea.\nR. C. Smith K.C. for the appellant. It was not necessary to make the Creans parties to this action. They had not any possession or control in any manner of either the lands or the letters patent in question, nor is any condemnation sought against them. In any case, the pleadings did not raise this question in a definite manner. The plaintiff was thus taken by surprise at the hearing and, if necessary, ought then to have been offered an opportunity of joining them in the suit, and it was no ground for dismissing the action. Art. 177 C. P. Q.; Currie v. Currie ([1]), per Boss\u00e9 J.; Chalmers v. North-West Shoe Co. ([2]); Jacob v. Klein ([3]); Montchamp v. Montchamp ([4]); Stewart v. Molsons Bank ([5]); McNally v. Pr\u00e9fontaine ([6]).\nThe respondents were bound to transfer to the syndicate without any demand whatsoever. They were en demeure by the very terms of the first clause\u00bb If, however, any demand were necessary, any member of the syndicate could make such demand. This demand was regularly made as evidenced inter alia by two notarial protests. The respondents answered by declaring that they \" never refused to join in forming a reasonable company which can assure practical results and success,\" and \" that they held the properties mentioned in the deed of agreement of the 29th April, 1900, subject to the terms of said agreement and for the purposes thereof.\" It is erroneous to say that the appellant had virtually a mere option which expired on a certain date, in default of his having exercised it; that he had under the agreement merely a conditional right which never became effective because the formation of the joint stock company was never fulfilled. Clause 2 of the agreement specifically declares that the re-adjustment of the interests of the parties in the said syndicate is based upon a full consideration of all the sums of money expended by the parties up to 9th April, 1900. Clause 3 then declares what the share and interest of the said parties in the present syndicate and in its assets and rights or in any corporation to be formed to take over its assets and rights shall be. Whatever moneys were expended on either side were fully taken into consideration and the parties received a. share in the syndicate \"and in its assets\" in proporlion to what they had actually expended. There was the disbursement of a substantial consideration, and the acquisition of a substantial share or interest in certain assets. The appellant did not acquire an inchoate or an eventual right, but an actual interest in an actual property. The respondents propose to confiscate this interest and despoil the appellant of all his rights in the property and assets of the syndicate upon the ground that a joint stock company was not formed before the 1st of September, 1901, an obligation which rested equally upon each member of the syndicate. The respondents were the obstructionists and held back to let the time expire and oust the appellant of his interest in the property.\nThe Natashquan Iron Company was formed within the time provided for by the agreement, and if the property and patent be transferred to the company upon respondents being transferred 70 per cent of the stock, they can have nothing to complain of. The directors of the company were duly authorized to allot such stock to the respondents to comply with the terms of the agreement, by resolution of the 27th August, 1901. The other 30 per cent will properly belong to Hopper and his associates as representing his 30 per cent in the syndicate. The respondents will have 70 per cent of the capital, therefore, it is immaterial whether the capital is one thousand dollars or one million dollars.\nFrancis McLennan K.C. and DeLorimier K.C. for the respondents. As to the transfer of the properties to the syndicate, the respondents contend that they were, with the consent of the majority, holding the properties as the nominees of the syndicate for the purposes of the syndicate, and the appellant cannot alone, and against all the other members of the syndicate. take objection to this. It is clear that Hopper cannot obtain the transfer of the properties to the company organized by himself, because the company contemplated was to be formed by all the parties to the contract of 30th May, 1900, and no outsiders could be brought into this company against their will. The majority would not confide the management and the disposal of interests valued by them at $1,000,000.00 to a board not selected by themselves. The respondents had 70 per cent of the total assets to be transferred to the company contemplated by them, and although the directors of the company formed by Hopper were authorized to offer and did offer to buy the property for cash, provided they would take in payment an equivalent amount of the stock of the company, it appears from the record that 50 per cent of the stock of the company formed by Hopper was already transferred to these outsiders, and the offer was consequently irregular and insufficient, as it does not appear that the stock already disposed of had been re-transferred to the company. The respondents could not be expected to part with their interests without receiving a full and valuable consideration for the same, as stipulated in the agreement,\nThe subsidiary demand that a transfer be ordered to be made to the syndicate must also be rejected. The object of the agreements was to give the syndicate a temporary control only of the properties and rights described until the company was formed, the formation of this company being the principal object in contemplation, as the only means by which the mines could be worked or disposed of with advantage. For that reason, if the company was not formed within the stipulated time, the whole scheme was to be abandoned and the parties restored to their original position, and Hopper and his two associates would lose not only their advances but also all their interests as well. Under these circumstances a transfer to the original members of the syndicate for one day, as the time expired the day after, would have been absolutely useless, because this syndicate could not have transferred to a company which never existed and had not the remotest chance of existing in the future.\nThe real difficulty and sole obstacle to the formation of the company projected was a difference of opinion between Hopper, who insisted that its capital should be $100,000, and Hoctor and May and the two Creans, who wished it to be fixed at not less than $400,000, upon the ground that the amount needed to acquire the necessary plant to work the mines, in case they could not dispose of them, would exceed $300,000. There could be no business ground for Hopper to object to the demand of the majority on this point, for he controlled only 30 per cent of the assets and had agreed that, in case of difference of opinion, three-fourths in value would control. The time having expired before a company was formed in accordance with the terms of the agreement, the promise of sale made by Hoctor and May lapsed and does not bind them. See arts. 1851, 1852 C. C.; Fuzier Herman, art. 1859, n. 9.\nThe action is bad because it is taken by the wrong person and against the wrong persons. It sets up a right belonging to a syndicate of seven persons, and alleges that the appellant represents three out of the seven, but there is no proof that he acquired the rights of Dobson and Webb. Art. 1571 C.C.; Prowse v. Nicholson. ([7]) He is claiming a right belonging to the syndicate, and it does not appear in any way that he represents the syndicate, but, on the contrary, it appears that all the other members were opposed to his action. Appellant cannot sue in his own name for the benefit and on behalf of the syndicate\u00bb The obligation to form a company was an obligation of the syndicate, but all the members of the syndicate are not made parties and, therefore, it must fail. Troplong, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, nn. 525-529; McFarran v. The Montreal Park & Island Railway Co. ([8]). As to the damages prayed for there is no proof of breach of contract by default.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The questions raised here must be determined by the interpretation of the written contract of 9th April, 1900.\nTwo of the parties owned lands supposed to contain minerals that might be made productive, especially by the use of appliances and methods for which two other of the contracting parties held patents. Two others joined in the contract after having expended some means in the way of investigation and experiment, and the plaintiff, who introduced these last-named as capitalists likely to aid in the development of the property, also became a party to the contract.\nHaving assembled, so to speak, their several interests and properties together for the common object of such gain as they might hope for by their joining their forces, they set out in this contract, which seems to have been of a purely tentative character, a method by which they might hope in following the lines laid down, to produce something of a more permanent character.\nThey assigned to the respective parties, by paragraph two of the contract, the proportion of share and interest each should have in the syndicate and its assets and rights or in any corporation formed to take over its assets and rights. They declared this by paragraph two to be a readjustment of their rights so that neither party could have any claim upon the other for past expenses for any reason whatever up to the date of this agreement.\nBy paragraphs one and four provision was made for the assignment to the syndicate, comprised of the parties to this agreement, of the properties and patents then held by the respective parties I have above referred to as respectively owning same.\nParagraphs five and six look to the acquisition of other properties and the furnishing of means for doing so.\nParagraph nine looked to a possible sale of the property and the recouping of the parties who had advanced moneys for acquisition past or prospective and for preliminary examinations before a division should be made of the proceeds of such sale.\nIt may be said of all these paragraphs but No. 6 that they were each and all self-operative and could not be governed by the will of a majority or of any one of the syndicate. Therefore none of them need be considered in regard to the effect to be given to No. 10, the last paragraph of the whole agreement.\nNow, the judgment prayed for is to have the properties and patents directed to be conveyed to the syndicate, and, if there were nothing more in the contract, this prayer must, as a matter of course in a properly constituted suit, have been granted, or, if not, should now be granted by allowing this appeal, unless we are to accept in its entirety the argument of counsel that the agreement to convey was, as a matter of law, a conveyance, and nothing further needed.\nIn the agreement there appear the following paragraphs 7 and 8, which, with paragraph 10 following hereunder, give rise to the contention of the parties and any difficulties that exist in the interpretation of the agreement.\n7. It is agreed that on or before September 1, 1901, a corporation or joint stock company shall be formed by the syndicate for the development and exploration of the above-mentioned properties, or any others that may be acquired under this agreement, and the shares in the said corporation or joint stock company shall be allotted to the members in the syndicate in the proportion of their several interests as herein expressed.\n8. If the joint stock company shall not be formed before the first day of September, one thousand nine hundred and one, or if, after September 1, 1900, a majority in value notify the other members of the syndicate that they require the formation of such company, and for a space of two months after the receipt of such notice the minority members refuse to unite in forming such company, then the whole of the lands above-mentioned shall revert to and become the property of the said Daniel Hoctor and Frank W. May, and any transfers made by the said Gerald J. Crean of his own patent or of any improvements thereof shall be void and of no effect, and all the parties shall be in the same position as if this contract had never been made, without any right to recover any moneys expended in connection with the syndicate after April 9th, 1900, except that any properties acquired by purchase by moneys contributed by members of the syndicate shall be sold and the net proceeds divided among those who contributed in the proportion of their contributions.\n10. All matters affecting anything more than mere detail of administration shall first be approved by all of the syndicate, and in case of difference of opinion three-fourths in value shall control.\nIt is quite clear from this paragraph 8 that it was intended that if these parties should fail to form a joint stock company by 1st September, 1901, the properties conveyed should revert to the parties who originally owned them, and all parties concerned should stand thenceforth as if nothing had ever been done or contracted for.\nI do not understand this to be denied save by saying that there was an implied obligation arising upon and from paragraph 7 that rendered it the legal duty of each member of the syndicate to do what in him lay to form the corporation or joint stock company pro- vided for, and that the defendants and others concerned did not discharge this duty, and therefore by reason of this breach of contract the provisions for the returning or reconveying of the properties never came into operation.\nI do not intend to be understood as affirming anything beyond what is needed for the purpose of disposing of this appeal.\nI think that the powers given by paragraph 10 of the agreement were intended to apply to and control the operation of the seventh paragraph.\nThere is nothing else but paragraphs 6 and 7 that it can apply to.\nEach of these three paragraphs, plainly, to my mind, needed, to make them effective, just some such determining power as paragraph 10 creates.\nParagraphs 6 and 9 are not in question here.\nThe difficulties in question all arise thus, I think, upon the consideration of, and are to be solved by the construction of paragraph 10 in relation to paragraph 7. Paragraph 10 is not repugnant to paragraph 7. But, on the contrary, the latter needs paragraph 10 or something of its nature to make anything of paragraph 7 at all. But for that it would, on honest differences arising between the parties as to the terms and conditions on which a company should be formed, prove to be impracticable and useless.\nParagraph 7 does not provide for anything that any court if applied to would declare specific performance of. It is of the most indefinite character and, apart from the notion of specific performance, many difficulties suggest themselves as to any remedy for a breach of its obligations whatever they may be.\nCan any one man sue any other for damages for such a breach? Can one man sue all the rest for such a breach? Or must he sue the syndicate which includes himself?\nCan we indirectly, by directing, now that the time for forming a corporation has elapsed, a conveyance of these properties, supply a remedy for this supposed breach? Any such legal speculations I venture to think are beyond what here could be required of us to execute. I think that to avoid such, or any such results, the parties relegated the decision of all such matters and things as could arise in the way of policy to be adopted or rejected, to the decision of the syndicate itself and that three-fourth's thereof in value, at least, should first agree before any policy could be adopted in relation to such things as incorporation and its terms.\nOf such matters I think the amount of the capital stock of the proposed corporation or \" joint stock company\" was one that had to be determined by three-fourth's in value of the syndicate.\nThe parties never were able to agree upon this initial step. I think that for the court to interfere under the facts here, and directly or indirectly coerce the three-fourths in the way plaintiff seeks would be a direct interference with the rights they reserved to themselves by the plain meaning of the agreement.\nThe power the plaintiff and his partners constituted for their government and the decision of such questions as in truth and fact are involved here, though that may not in words appear in the pleadings, has decided against plaintiff. He must abide by it.\nUnless and until he can reverse that decision I do not think we can go through the idle form of directing a conveyance of properties that should be reconveyed in the events that have happened.\nWhether or not in a proper case, if one of the members of the syndicate, moved by improper motives, could have been restrained from deciding as they did, I am not concerned with here.\nI think the defendants and those with them acted within their rights.\nI do not attach the importance to the quotation from the evidence of defendant Hoctor that appellant's counsel did, and I do not think it, read with the context, shews an intention willingly to frustrate the formation of a company under the agreement.\nI doubt if it was not merely the hasty expression of the irritated witness, rather than the business man giving the result of the true history of the attitude that defendants had assumed or the position they had taken, as shewn by the other evidence regarding negotiations that had taken place.\nThe rest of the evidence taken as a whole does not permit me to find any such result or determination by the defendants as plaintiff contends is shewn.\nIt is to be borne in mind that the plaintiff after introducing capitalists whose resources were the one originating cause of any agreement between the parties abandoned the enterprise and left the defendants without any present hope for the working out of the purposes of the parties\nI am not going to scrutinize too closely the action of parties, thus placed by the plaintiff, and I think that the hope of getting capital being lost the defendants were quite within their rights in staying their hands in the forming of any corporation till they saw some way out, other than a way of merely giving plaintiff a lien on defendant's property for some claims he had bought from his associates.\nSuch a result seemed likely to be all that would flow from the submission of defendants to the dictation of the plaintiff. I do not think it necessary in this view to consider the many other interesting questions that have arisen. But one very obvious difficulty is that the terms of the contract by reason of Dobson & Webb assigning to plaintiff could not be carried out as designed since they were to have become comparators and each get a 10 per cent interest or share of the stock. The plaintiff's substitution for them was not contemplated by the contract.\nConstruing the agreement as I do the facts fall short of entitling plaintiff to any relief and the appeal should be dismissed with costs\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Smith, Markey & Montgomery.\nSolicitors for the respondents : Angers, DeLorimier & Godin.\n[1] Q.

C.\nUpon the execution of a deed of obligation and hypothec, the plaintiffs became sureties for the debtor and, for further-security, the debtor assigned and delivered to the mortgagee, by way of pledge, a policy of assurance upon his life for the amount of the loan. One of the clauses of the deed provided \"for further securing the repayment of the said loan, interest and accessories and premiums of insurance on the said life policy \" that the debtor and sureties \" by way of pledge \u00e0 titre d'antichr\u00e8se, transferred and made over unto the said lender \" certain constituted rents and seigniorial dues. The deed further pro-vided that the actual agent of the seigniory should remain agent until the loan should be repaid with interest and insurance premiums disbursed by the creditor, and that the creditor should have the right to dismiss said agent should he fail to make out the revenues of the seigniory and remit to the creditor the amount necessary for the payment of such interest and insurance premiums. It further provided that the lender should not be responsible to the debtor and sureties for the agent's acts, the debtor and sureties assuming responsibility therefore. The judgment appealed from found, as facts, that the sureties had made a provision in the hands of the creditor for the purpose of payment of the premiums out of the revenues assigned, that, for such purposes, the creditor had become the mandatory of the sureties and responsible for the due fulfilment of such mandate, and that there were sufficient funds derived from such revenues to pay a renewal premium which fell clue shortly before the death of the debtor, and of which payment had been omitted to be made through some neglect or fault of the creditor in obtaining the funds therefore from the agent. In consequence of this failure to pay the premium the benefit of the policy was lost.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (Q. R. 13 K. B. 329), Idington J. dissenting, that the deed contemplated the payment of the premiums by the creditor out of the funds assigned; that the creditor had failed to use proper diligence in respect to the payment of the premium and that the sureties were, therefore, entitled to be discharged pro tanto and the property pledged released accordingly.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side ([1]), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Pagnuelo J. in the District of Montreal, and maintaining the action of the plaintiffs and dismissing the incidental demand of the defendants with costs.\nIn March, 1894, the late Jonathan Wilfred L. W\u00fcrtele, deceased, borrowed .$7,500 from the company, appellants, and subsequently, in February, 1899, he borrowed from the company a further sum of $2,500, in each case giving a deed of obligation and hypothec. The terms and conditions of the deeds were identical and both affected the Seigniory of Bourg-Marie de l'Est, and the constituted rents thereof, for the purpose of securing the repayment of the loans, the Honourable J. S. C. W\u00fcrtele, as institute in the substitution charged upon the said seigniory and Ernest F. W\u00fcrtele, as the substitute (in case of the death of the borrower, the first substitute), becoming parties to both deeds for the purpose of charging the seigniory with said hypothecs, and also thereby obliging themselves as sureties for the repayment of the loans jointly and severally with the borrower. As further security, in each case, policies of assurance on the life of the borrower for the amounts of the loans, respectively, were assigned, transferred and delivered to the company, at the times of the execution of the deeds. In each of the deeds of obligation there were clauses as follows:\n\" And for further securing the repayment of the said loan, interest and accessories and premiums of insurance on the said life policy, the said Honourable Jonathan S. C. W\u00fcrtele, the said borrower, and the said Ernest Frederick W\u00fcrtele have, by way of pledge, \u00e0 titre d'antichr\u00e8se, transferred and made over unto the said lender, accepting hereof by the said Richard John Evans, the said constituted rents of the said seigniory of Bourg-Marie de l'Est, established by the said schedule No. 10 of the seigniorial cadastre of the old district of Three Rivers, and entered in the said schedule under the cadastral numbers from one to four hundred and sixty-six, both inclusive.\n\" It is covenanted and agreed by and between the said parties that the present agent of the said seigniory, Charles John Campbell W\u00fcrtele, of the City of Sorel, Esquire, advocate, shall retain the agency of said seigniory until such time that the said lender shall have been repaid the amount of the present loan, in capital, interest and accessories and insurance premiums, but with the option, on the part of the said lender, to dismiss him should he fail to make out of the revenues of said seigniory any of the instalments of interest as they become due, or, at the expiry of the term of payment, if the capital is not repaid, or any of the insurance premiums as may be paid by the said lender.\n\" It is also understood that the said lender shall not in any way be responsible to the said borrower and to the said Honourable Jonathan S. C. W\u00fcrtele and Ernest Frederick W\u00fcrtele for the acts and deeds of the said agent, the said borrower and sureties hereby exonerating the said lender from all such responsibility as regards the acts and deeds of said agent, and assuming themselves personally the said responsibility.\n\" It is understood that the collection of the said constituted rents shall never be, at any time, at the expense of the lender, but that, on the contrary, all expenses attending that collection should be exclusively borne by the said borrower and sureties and kept out of said constituted rents and retained as first charge thereon.\n\" And for security of the payment of said insurance premiums, liquidated damages, expenses above mentioned, interest on overdue interest, and of that which may happen to be due to the lender over and above the two years' interest and the current year, and of the repayment of any such taxes as may be imposed on the present loan by virtue of any law in force in this province and of the repayment of all expenses incurred by the lender for the said publication of the above transfer by way of pledge, as required by law, the borrower and said Honourable Jonathan S. C. W\u00fcrtele and Ernest Frederick W\u00fcrtele have hypothecated the above described immoveable property in favour of the lender (in the first deed) to the further extent of one thousand and fifty dollars\" (and, in the second deed) \"to the further extent of three hundred dollars.\"\nThe company paid all the half yearly premiums on the first policy, with moneys supplied by the borrower during the first three years and, afterwards, with funds for which they reimbursed themselves out of the rents pledged to them, but they neglected to pay the premium on the policy transferred to them at the time of the second loan, in February, 1899, which became due in the month of January following, (1900), and the borrower, Jonathan Wilfred L. W\u00fcrtele, died on the 24th of February, 1900, at which time the second policy had been allowed to lapse, it was alleged, through the neglect of the company.\nThe action was brought by the sureties for a decree against the company ordering them to execute a discharge of the second mortgage, (tender being made of the difference between the amount due thereon and the $2,500, amount of the lapsed policy) and to retransfer to the plaintiffs the constituted rents of the seigniory transferred to the company to secure the second loan. The company contested the action, refused to discharge the sureties and hypothec and made an incidental demand against the plaintiffs for the amount of the second mortgage which they claimed to be still due and unsatisfied. The judgment of the Superior Court dismissed the action of the plaintiffs with costs, allowed the incidental demand by the defendants, and condemned the plaintiffs to pay the amount thereof with costs to the company. On appeal to the Court of King's Bench, this judgment was set aside and the plaintiff\u2019s action maintained with costs while the defendants' incidental demand was dismissed with costs. The company now appeals.\nThe questions raised upon the argument of this appeal are referred to and discussed in the judgments now reported.\nKAVANAGH K.C. for the appellants.\nANGERS K. C. and DeLorimier K.C. for the respondents.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I concur in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs for the reasons stated by my brother Nesbitt.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I might be satisfied by a reference to the complete and well considered opinion by Chief Justice Lacoste to indicate the reasons which induce me to dismiss the appeal, but on account of the importance of the questions which it presents, I feel myself bound to state them shortly in the few following observations, although they may not add to the force of his reasoning.\nI have arrived at the conclusion that the obligation of the appellant to pay the insurance premium results both from the contract and from the law.\nIn the first place, as to the contract, it must not be lost sight of that the hypothecated seigniory, Bourg-Marie de l'Est, having a permanent revenue, not subject to fluctuation, was amply sufficient to guarantee the loan, in capital, interest, assurance premiums and other accessories, even leaving a surplus reverting to Judge W\u00fcrtele, a fact admitted by the appellant; that there was no reason why it should have the additional guarantee of a life assurance policy from the borrower or anyone else; that the borrower, the eldest son of Judge W\u00fcrtele, Jonathan W., known by the name of \" Jack\", was not the owner of it and that he had a simple expectancy of ownership, namely, in case he survived his father. This event failing, his younger brother, Ernest, was to become owner on the decease of the father under the substitution created by the will of their ancestor Josias W\u00fcrtele. Ernest, and the father, the latter having alone the right to the revenues during his life as institute or grev\u00e9, had therefore, an interest to protect himself against the possibility of Jack, the borrower, pre-deceasing him. The father was willing to deprive himself of a portion of his revenues to oblige his eldest son, but like his son Ernest, he did not wish to expose himself to repay the capital sum loaned. It was, accordingly, agreed between all the parties to the deed of obligation, evidently for the advantage of the sureties, that Jack should secure a policy of assurance on his life for the amount of the capital of the loan. A policy was taken by Jack W\u00fcrtele for $2,500, and delivery of it with a transfer indorsed on the back was made to the appellant which caused the assignment to be accepted by the assurance company. The deed of obligation which was executed on the 7th of February 1899, does not state by whom the premium should be; paid in January each year. In any event it could not in the first place be due by anyone but the principal debtor, and it would only be in default of such payment by him that the sureties could be called upon to do so. Naturally, the first premium was paid by Jack, but the second (which was the last) was not, and the appellant did nothing to keep the policy in force, although it had the best guarantees in the world that the needful advance, $110.25, would be repaid; it had the hypothec for the insurance premiums and even an additional hypothec for $300. But what is remarkable, about the same date, on the 8th January, 1900, it paid, long before the last day of grace, fixed at the 31st of January, the semi-annual assurance premium upon another policy for $7,500 in connection with another obligation executed in 1894 between the same parties and with the same terms and conditions. Several times previously this premium was likewise advanced by the appellant for which it was reimbursed without delay. But with regard to the policy for $2,500, the appellant, by an unpardonable negligence, did nothing to keep it in force; it did not even notify Judge \"W\u00fcrtele, who resided in the same city, of what they had done on the 8th January and of its intention with regard to the other policy for $2,500; if it had done so he had all the month of January to pay the premium.? The consequence was that the policy lapsed and Jack W\u00fcrt\u00e9le died a few days afterwards, on 20th February 1900, and several years before his father. By their action the sureties ask to be discharged. The appellant contends that the loss should fall upon them.\nThe conduct of the appellant in this matter is simply inexplicable. It contends for the first time, in its factum, \u2014its plea, and the judges of the courts below being silent thereon\u2014that the larger policy had a commercial value and that that was the reason that the premium was paid, as if it was needed for the reimbursement of the loan. It is an afterthought conceived evidently for the purpose of covering, if possible, the carelessness and responsibility of an employee of the appellant, not examined, who was charged with renewal of policies of assurance. If this pretended excuse was well founded, the appellant would not only be in fault but also in bad faith, because it had deliberately allowed the insurance policy to lapse.\nIt is well to note that the appellent had no more funds in hand to provide for one of these policies than for the other. It had done nothing to obtain from the agent, Charles W\u00fcrtele, the judge's brother, who was, at any time, he tells us in his testimony, in a position to remit the necessary amount. This is what he says, speaking of the two loans:\nQ. Did you pay the premium of insurance every time you were called upon?\nA. I did. Every time I was notified I paid it.\nQ. By whom were you ever notified?\nA. Never except by the Trust and Loan Company.\nQ. Never except by the Trust and Loan Company?\nA. No.\nQ. Were you ever notified by the Trust and Loan Company to pay the premium on the second policy for two thousand five hundred dollars?\nA. No, I never was.\nQ. Did you know where that policy was?\nA. I never knew anything about it till I came up to Montreal this time.\nQ. Now, will you look at this policy, Plaintiffs Exhibit p-7. (The policy for $2,500). The insured there is\nA. Jonathan W. W\u00fcrtele.\nQ. The borrower? A. Which I understand to be the borrower.\nQ. You knew him? A. I knew him, yes.\nQ. Were you in a position to pay the premium on that policy had you been requested to do so by the Trust and Loan Company?\nA. Yes, that is at any time after the eleventh of November.\nMr. Kavanagh K.C.:\nQ. In what year?\nA. Any year.\nMr. Angers K. G., continuing:\nQ. That was payable in January?.\nA. Yes, I was in a position then to pay it had I been requested.\nI infer from the clauses of the deed of obligation from the construction that the appellant's conduct has given to it, and the circumstances, the obligation on its part to pay the premiums upon their falling due, solely for the protection of the sureties, so much so that the appellant has not considered it necessary to protect the policy.\nThe appellant contends that Judge W\u00fcrtele received a part of the revenues so as to render them insufficient to meet the premiums. The precise testimony of the agent is quite to the contrary. The evidence moreover shews that Judge W\u00fcrtele had, besides the Seigniory of Bourg-Marie de l'Est, the Seigniory of St. David and some mills in the immediate vicinity, yielding him altogether more than $3,000 net per year, all administered by the same agent, his brother Charles, who, by the deed of obligation, was also the agent of the appellant. The receipts of all these properties formed only one fund of which the agent rendered account in one and the same statement; and, in receiving the money which the agent remitted to him, Judge W\u00fcrtele could reasonably have supposed that he was receiving only that which belonged to him. 'Examined as a witness for the appellant, he says:\nMy brother was appointed agent to receive the rents of the Seigniory of Bourg Marie, to be applied in default of my son's paying, to be applied on demand and on request by the Trust and Loan Company, to the payment of interest and premiums of insurance, and when that was paid, when all the demands of the company were satisfied-he paid over the balance to me. It was included in my general balance.\nIf Judge W\u00fcrtele received more than his share, which is not shewn, it was the fault of the appellant which did nothing to make its rights known to the agent; it did not send him a copy or a memo of the deed of obligation; it did not even inform him of the existence of the second loan.\nBut, assuming that the agreement and the appellant's conduct do not establish the duty on the part of the appellant to pay the premium, the law imposes it by two precise articles, arts. 1959 and 1973 C. C.\nArticle 1959, different from the Roman Law (Pothier, obl. n. 557; Baudry-Lacantinerie, caut. n. 1175) more precise then the old French jurisprudence, similar to article 2037 of the Code Napol\u00e9on, and it seems in accord also with the English law, decrees as follows:\nThe suretyship is at an end when by the act of the creditor the surety can no longer be subrogated in the rights, hypothecs and privileges of such creditor.\nThe respondents knew of the practical effect of this article of the Civil Code; they knew they could rely upon the assurance policy for reimbursement of the capital of the loan in case of the death of the borrower before his father. The appellant, by its act, has made it impossible for it to transfer all its rights, namely, those accruing from the assurance policy and, in consequence of its negligence, the sureties find themselves released by the terms of art. 1959.\nIt cannot be contended that the forfeiture decreed by this article takes place only when \" the act \" of the creditor is positive, in commitendo; it may result likewise if it consists simply in omittendo and is in good, faith. The doctrine and jurisprudence as well in France as in Quebec and Louisiana, which also reproduced the article of the Code Napol\u00e9on, are in accord and leave not the least doubt on this point, which, moreover, has been conceded by Mr. Kavanagh, the appellant's counsel. Nevertheless he added, and he maintains in his factum, that the article does not apply to sureties jointly and severally liable; but in this respect his contention is overruled by the commentators and the arr\u00eats, the article of. the code making no distinction between simple suretyship and several suretyship; they are collected in Beauchamp's Code Civil Annot\u00e9, art. 1959; Merrick's Rev. Civil Code of La., art. 3061; Gilbert sur Sirey, art, 2037 C. N.; 4 Aubry & Rau, p. 694; 9 Marcad\u00e9 p. 368; Fuzier-Herman, vo. Cautionnement, nos 750-761; 12 Huc, nos. 250-253; 21 Baudry-Lacantinerie Cautionnement, nos. 1174-1180.\nJudge W\u00fcrtele was not content with the protection afforded him by art. 1959 C. C. Familiar with this class of financial operations and undoubtedly, on the admission even of Mr. Kavanagh, the highest legal authority in such matters, he stipulated in the deed that the policy of assurance should be delivered and held \" by way of pledge.\" This pledge actually existed, for the stipulations and the facts fulfil all the necessary conditions to make the pledge perfect. The policy of assurance, which is movable property, un bien meuble, was placed in the hands of the creditor with the consent of assurer and assured and sureties, as a security for the debt, and that is what constitutes pledge. Arts. 374, 1966 C. C. Then comes article 1973:\nThe creditor is liable for the loss or deterioration of the thing pledged according to the rules established in the title of obligations.\nOn the other hand, the debtor is obliged to repay to the creditor the necessary expenses incurred by him in the preservation of the thing.\nIt appears to me clearly that, in the terms of this article, the appellant was obliged to pay the premiums, whether provided for, guaranteed or not, saving recourse for reimbursement. This article has the 'principal debtor in view, but it enures to the benefit of the surety invoking it. Art. 1958 C. C.\nFor these reasons I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur for the reasons stated by my brother Nesbitt.\nNesbitt J.\u2014The mortgage in question contained a provision as follows:\nAnd for further securing the repayment of the said loan, interest and accessories, the said borrower hath transferred and assigned, and doth transfer and assign by way of pledge unto the said lender the policy of insurance. * * * * And for further securing the repayment of the said loan, interest and accessories and premiums of insurance on the said life policy, the said Honourable J. S. C. W\u00fcrtele, the said borrower, and the said Ernest Frederick W\u00fcrtele, have by way of pledge, \u00e0 titre d'antichr\u00e8se, transferred and made over unto the said lender * * * the said constituted rents, etc.\nThe mortgage further provided that the agent of the seigniory, C. J. C. W\u00fcrtele, should remain agent until the lender should be paid the loan, interest and insurance premiums, with the right of dismissal of the said agent by the lender if he failed to make out of the revenues of the said seigniory the interest or insurance premiums. It further provided that the lender was not to be responsible to the borrower and sureties for the acts and deeds of the agent, the borrower and sureties assuming responsibility therefor.\nThe Court of King's Bench, for the Province of Quebec, held that the sureties had made a provision in the hands of the creditor for the purpose of payment of the premium and undertaken to employ the assigned revenues in payment of the interest and premiums, and that for such purpose it became the mandatory of the sureties and was responsible as any other mandatary for the due fulfilment of its mandate. It was also held that the evidence disclosed that there were funds derived from the rents of the seigniory which were sufficient to pay the premiums due in January. It was further held that it was through forgetfulness or some fault on the part of the loan company that it did not obtain from the agent the amount required to pay the premium.\nAssuming these findings of fact to be correct, I think the judgment appealed from ought to be affirmed. I also think, in the clauses in the mortgage I have extracted, the premiums were contemplated to be paid by the loan company and repayment made to them out of the funds assigned. I think that Ernest W\u00fcrtele had a right to expect that the creditor would use due diligence to see that no one did obtain any moneys until after the rents so assigned had been properly applied to the payment of the insurance premiums to keep alive the policy assigned to the company by the borrower. This policy was the only security which Ernest W\u00fcrtele, on payment of the debt, could receive. The rents which were mortgaged belonged not to the borrower but to Mr. Justice W\u00fcrtele. I think that by art. 1570 of the Code the assignment as between the parties to the deed was complete. That article provides as follows:\nThe sale of debts and rights of action against third persons, is perfected between the seller and buyer by the completion of the title if authentic, or the delivery of it if under private signature.\nSignification is only required as against the censitaires. Bank of Toronto v. St. Lawrence Fire Insurance Co. ([2]).\nArt. 1966 C. C. provides as follows: Pledge is a contract by which a thing is placed in the hands of a cred tor, or, being already in his possession, is retained by him with the owner's consent, in security for his debt.\nThe thing may be given either by the debtor or by a third person in his behalf.\nArt. 1973 C. C. provides:\nThe creditor is liable for the loss or deterioration of the thing pledged according to the rules established in the title of obligations.\nOn the other hand, the debtor is pledged to repay to the creditor the necessary expenses incurred by him in the preservation of the thing.\nArt. 1959 C. C provides:\nThe suretyship is at an end when by the act of the creditor the surety can no longer be subrogated in the rights, hypothecs and privileges of such creditor.\nThis Latter Is A Copy Of Article 2037 Of The Code Napoleon.\nLaurent, vol. 28, No. 310, say's:\nQue faut il entendre, dans l'article 2037, par fait du cr\u00e9ancier? Est-ce seulement un fait positif, tel que la renonciation \u00e0 l'hypoth\u00e8que, ou est-ce aussi la simple n\u00e9gligence par suite de laquelle le cr\u00e9ancier perd ses droits? Si l'on s'attache au principe tel que l'ont expliqu\u00e9 les orateurs du gouvernement et du Tribunat, il faut dire que toute faute du cr\u00e9ancier qui a pour cons\u00e9quence de faire p\u00e9rir, en tout ou en partie, les garanties qui assurent le payement de la dette entra\u00eene la d\u00e9charge de la caution. On suppose que celle-ci s'engage sous la condition d'\u00eatre subrog\u00e9e aux droits du cr\u00e9ancier, et que celui-ci s'oblige \u00e0 conserver ces garanties. D\u00e8s que le cr\u00e9ancier ne remplit pas cette obligation, il est responsable; or, il ne la remplit pas par cela seul que les garanties p\u00e9rissent par une faute qui lui est imputable; et les fautes se commettent par n\u00e9gligence, aussi bien que par un fait positif.\nThis corresponds with the English law upon the subject. In Walls v. Shutleworlh ([3]) Pollock C.B. says:\nThe rule upon the subject seems to be that if the person guaranteed does an act injurious to the surety, or inconsistent with his rights, or if he omits to do any act which his duty enjoins him to do, and the omission proves injurious to the surety, the latter will be discharged. Story's Equity Jurisprudence, sec. 325. The same principle is enunciated and exemplified by the Master of the Rolls in Pearl v. Deacon ([4]) where he cited with approbation the opinion of Lord Eldon in Craythorne v. Swin-burne ([5]), that the rights of a surety depend rather on principles of equity than upon the actual contract; that there may be a quasi contract; but that the right of the surety arises out of the equitable relation of the parties.\nThis rule was adopted by this court in Merchants Bank of Canada v. McKay ([6]).\nIn deColyar on Guarantees (3 ed) page 446, the rule is stated as follows:\nWe have already seen that a surety is entitled to the benefit of all the securities which the creditor has against the principal. It follows, therefore, that, if the surety be deprived of this benefit by the act of the creditor, he will be discharged to the full extent of the security to which he was entitled; and, consequently, a creditor is bound to use diligence and care with regard to securities held by him. Thus, for instance, a creditor holding a mortgage for a guaranteed debt is bound to hold it for the benefit of the surety so as to enable him, on paying the debt, to take the security in its original condition, unimpaired. The right of the surety is to have the same security in exactly the same plight and condition in which it stood in the creditor's hands. This doctrine does not, however, apply to such securities as life insurances. It is not the duty of the creditor on the bankruptcy of the debtor to keep up a policy on the life of the, latter. On the contrary, it is his duty to sell and realize such a security.\nIn Rowlatt's Law of Principal and Surety (1899 ed.) the rule is stated more narrowly and the cases referred to by deColyar as justifying his statement of the law are analyzed and additional cases cited, particularly the case of Queen v. Fay ([7]). I shall refer to this case later. Brandt on Suretyship (2 ed.), secs. 444 and 448, inclusively, collects the English and American authorities, and with special reference to Wulff v. Jay ([8]), lays down the doctrine that omission is equivalent to commission. I do not think that the cases go this length. So far as I can see the French authorities agree with what I conceive to be the result of the English authorities, namely, that unless there is some duty to do that which is omitted, such duty arising from express or implied obligation, then mere passiveness by the creditor will not release the surety. See, in addition to the cases referred to in deColyar, already quoted, Story's Equity. (2 ed. London, 1892); Carter v. White ([9]) at page 670; and the review of all the English authorities to date by Chief Baron Palles in The Queen v. Fay ([10]), before noted.\nI think that in every case where the surety has been held to have been discharged, the decision was founded upon-some act or omission of the creditor which was held to be a breach of obligation due by him to the surety. Chief Baron Palles seemed (in the Fay Case (2) ) to think that if the act which was omitted could have been performed either by the surety or by the creditor the creditor could not be held liable, and if that was so I think it would be difficult to hold the loan company liable in this case. But in appeal Lord Chancellor Ball rests his judgment upon the ground that neither the nature of the security nor the knowledge possessed by the officers of the Crown that there were any lands against which registration of the bond could be effective, would render a duty to register incumbent upon the officers of the Crown.\nAs I have said the searching analysis which has been made of all the authorities in The Queen v. Fay (2) renders it unnecessary to go through the various cases again, and I am content to rest my judgment upon the short ground that the sureties made a provision for the express purpose of paying these premiums and had the right to rely upon the loan company making that provision effective by notification to C. J. C. W\u00fcrtele of the amounts required for interest and premiums, and he was to collect the moneys from the rents sufficient to pay this premium and remit same to the loan company; and that the sureties had a right to assume that if the loan company desired the surety to pay the premiums it would notify its desire to the surety and its non-reliance upon the provision for payment created by the mortgage and assignment of the rents.\nI cannot distinguish this case in principle from this illustration. Suppose the sureties had handed over to the loan company bonds or certificates of stock the coupons or dividends of which were ample to pay interest and premiums and the loan company had failed to pay the premiums and allowed the policy to lapse, would it be argued the sureties could not claim a discharge pro tanto?\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSince writing the above, I have had the advantage of reading the opinion of my brother Girouard and, so far as that opinion is based upon the construction of the documents hypothecating the seigniory and pledging the rents thereof, I fully agree with it.\nWith regard to the construction to be placed upon art. 1973 of the Quebec Code, I do not find it necessary, for the purposes of this case, to express any views, as I have reached my conclusion upon the proper construction of the written documents between the parties.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014On the 17th March, 1894, the late Jonathan W. L. W\u00fcrtele son of the respondent, the late Honourable Jonathan Saxton Campbell W\u00fcrt\u00e9le, borrowed $7,500 from the appellants and secured same by deed of transfer in which the respondents joined as sureties, and by transfer of a policy of a life insurance on the life of the borrower.\nThis transaction is, as far as the matter now in question is concerned, of no moment save as furnishing some light upon the relations of the parties thereto and that it remained a prior charge upon the properties now in question when the later mortgage or hypothecation we have to consider was created. The instruments are, save as to the amounts secured by each, in all material terms almost identical.\nInferences might, as was pressed upon us in the argument, be drawn from the acts of the parties in relation to the first document and transactions it related to showing how they understood such a document.\nI am inclined to think that the course of dealing in respect of the first policy of insurance on which for the three first years the company did not pay premiums tended to forbid the respondents from relying upon any obligation or supposed obligation of the appellants to look after, for the sake of respondents, the maintenance of the second policy of insurance.\nIn saying that much I desire to make clear that I discard such inference in arriving at the conclusion I do in regard to the claims set up and treat the matter as if such inference had not been possible, for I doubt if its consideration is a legitimate factor in dealing with what is now in dispute.\nThe first mortgage and its priority over the one we have to consider and the means by which it was secured, including the agency of Charles W\u00fcrtele, must all be kept in mind however.\nThe same borrower, on the 7th of February, 1899. borrowed from the appellants $2,500, and by a deed of obligation and transfer of that date in which the plaintiffs as sureties joined secured the repayment of said sum on the 1st day of May, 1904, with interest at six per centum per annum yearly at the office of the lender on the 1st day of November in each and every year.\nThe borrower also had transferred by assignment of same date a policy of insurance for $2,500 on his life dated 24th of January, 1899, which was handed over to the appellants when assigned, and this assignment was intimated to the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada who were the insurers.\nThe premium was $110.25 which for the first year had not been paid when the assignment of policy was made and deed of obligation and transfer had been executed on 7th February, 1899.\nThe receipt for this first premium shows that it was on the 14th February, 1899, that it was paid. It was not paid by the appellants.\nOn the 2nd December, 1899, the sum of $600 was paid by the hand of Charles J. C. W\u00fcrtele, agent of the Seigniory of Bourg Marie de l'Est, out of the rents of which he was the collector, to the appellants to cover a year's interest on both loans.\nNothing more was ever paid appellants since the second loan but the sum of $111.95 to pay a half yearly premium on the first assigned policy, and there does not seem to have been any further communications had between the appellants and the respondents and the borrower in relation to the second loan or any of the securities therefor, or, in short, in any way whatsoever relating to such matters, till after the death of the borrower, the late J. W. W\u00fcrtele, on the 24th of February, 1900.\nIt is said that if the second premium of insurance for and in respect of the policy for $2500 had been paid on the 1st of January, 1900. or any day up to the 31st January, 1900, that such would by reason of his death have become payable to the appellants and would have been paid, and the respondents, who were only sureties, would have been relieved from the burthen.\nIt is further alleged that the non-payment of this premium is attributable to the neglect of the defendants and that as a result the respondents arc released and are entitled to have their property discharged of and from what is now apparently a charge thereon. In order that the true position may be clearly-apprehended I may state that the deed of obligation and transfer I adverted to above bound the late Honourable J. S. C. \"W\u00fcrtele as well as the borrower personally to repay the loan but only in the event of his becoming entitled under the will of his grandfather to the hypothecated property. Did it bind Ernest Frederick W\u00fcrtele in any way?\nThey all however, the late Honourable J. S. C. W\u00fcrtele as institute and said two sons as substitutes under said act, will and testament, hypothecated the real estate and immovable property therein described as part of seigniory commonly known as Bourg Marie de l'Est, now represented by the capital of the constituted rents, to secure the repayment of the loan of $2500 and interest.\nAnd by these instruments the borrower for further securing such repayment transferred by way of pledge unto the lender the policy of* insurance dated 24th January, 1900, for $2500.\nAnd then the provisions therein are as follows:\nAnd for further securing the repayment of the said loan, interest and accessories and premiums of insurance on the said life policy, the said Honourable Jonathan S. C. W\u00fcrtele, the said borrower, and the said Ernest Frederick W\u00fcrtele have by way of pledge, \u00e0, titre d'antichr\u00e8se, transferred and made over unto the said lender, accepting hereof by the said Laurence Edye, the said constituted rents of the said seigniory of Bourg Marie de l'Est, established by the said schedule No. 10 of the seignorial cadastre of the old district of Three Rivers and entered in the said schedule under the cadastral numbers from one to four hundred and sixty-six both inclusive.\nIt is covenanted and agreed by and between the said parties, that the present agent of the said seigniory, Charles John Campbell W\u00fcrtele, of the City of Sorel, Esquire, Advocate, shall retain the agency of the said seigniory until such a time that the said lender shall have been, repaid the amount of the present loan, in capital, interest and accessories, and insurance premiums; but with the option on the part of the said lender to dismiss him, should he fail to make out of the revenues of said seigniory any of the instalments of interest as they become due, or at the expiry of the term of payment if the capital is not repaid or any of the insurance premiums as may be paid by the said lender.\nIt is also understood that the said lender shall not in any way be responsible to the said borrower and to the said Honourable Jonathan S. C. W\u00fcrtele and Ernest Frederick W\u00fcrtele for the acts and deeds of the said agent, the said borrower and sureties hereby exonerating the said lender from all such responsibility as regards the acts and deeds of said agent, and assuming themselves personally the said responsibility.\nIt is understood that the collection of the said constituted rents shall never be, at any time, at the expense of the lender, but that on the contrary all expenses attending that collection shall be exclusively borne by the said borrower and sureties and kept out of said constituted rents and retained as a first charge thereon.\nIt is also understood and stipulated that all expense incurred by the lender for the publication of the above transfer by pledge, as required by law, shall be paid by said borrower and sureties to the said lender.\n(Stipulations are here made for certain expenses and damages.)\nThe borrower shall pay interest at the rate of six per cent on overdue interest.\nAnd for the security of the payment of said insurance premiums, liquidated damages, expenses above mentioned, interest on overdue interest, and of the repayment of any such taxes as may be imposed on the present loan by virtue of any law in force in this province, and of the repayment of all expenses incurred by the lender for the said publication of the above transfer by way of pledge as required by law, the borrower and said Honourable Jonathan S. C. W\u00fcrtele and Ernest Frederick W\u00fcrtele hypothecated the above described immovable property in favour of the lender to the further extent of three hundred dollars.\nUpon these provisions and the relations between appellants as creditors, and respondents as sureties, for the debt in question the respondents rely in claiming that an obligation rested upon the appellants to do all that was necessary to keep alive the security furnished by the $2,500 policy of insurance.\nIt is to be observed that there is not here or elsewhere in the document now to be interpreted an express covenant by the appellants to discharge any such duty as the alleged obligation implies, or to give notice to Charles W\u00fcrtele, the agent It is to be further observed that one would naturally expect so serious an obligation as the payment of $110.25 a year, if intended by the parties, to have been expressly provided for.\nIf intended at all it must operate for five years at least.\nWhere was the money to come from?\nTwo sources are pointed out\u2014One the annual revenue from the Seigniory which the agent in his evidence speaks of as follows:\nQuestion.\u2014Will you please state if the amount you collect annually could cover, and did cover the interest on the first loan, and the premium on the first insurance, the interest on the second loan, and the premium on the second policy?\nAnswer.\u2014Yes, I collect sufficient yearly to cover the amount.\nQuestion.\u2014Was there a surplus?\nAnswer. \u2014Well, when everything was collected there would be a surplus of thirty some odd dollars.\nIt is clear that this makes no provision for the expenses of collection or the supervision of the collection.\nThen the other source is that provided for by the hypothecation above set forth of the imovable property in favour of the lender to the further extent of three hundred dollars to cover this and all the other matters therein specified.\nThis rather scant sort of security does not encourage one to believe that the appellants thought they were undertaking to look after the premiums upon this policy which the evidence shews was, and would be for two years longer, even if premiums paid, worth less as a realizable commercial asset, if insured should live so long.\nIt is to be observed that in none of these provisions is there any allowance made for interest upon the sums that might thus be advanced by the appellants for the payments of premiums of insurance. The rents which formed the revenue of the Seigniory fell due on the 11th day of November in each year, and generally were all collected by the agent Charles J. C. W\u00fcrtele on or before the 2nd of December and accounted for and paid over to the respondent, the late Honourable J. S. C. W\u00fcrtele, by the 2nd of December.\nThose for 1899 proved no exception and the agent had no answer to the demand for the balance due to the institute if he asked for it.\nHow then can it be said that the appellants had funds placed in their hands to meet the premium of insurance falling due in respect of this $2,500 in the month of January?\nThe instrument giving any right to the use of such rents only gave it in relation to such premium as the appellants had paid to repay them.\nThe appellants could only, if any obligation rested upon them to see the premiums paid, .advance it in January, and wait till following November to be repaid, and thus lose the interest on the money in the meantime.\nThis is not an idle suggestion. It represents the actual condition appellants were left in by the respondent's surety, the Honourable J. S. C. W\u00fcrtele, in January, 1900, for he admits he was paid the balance in the agent's hands after the interest on both loans and the premium on the first life insurance had been provided for.\nHe, in other words, by this suit sought to hold the appellants liable for not having used the money they never received (but, so far as existing any place, he got) to pay the premiums due in January, 1900.\nThis divested of all its wrappings that obscure the issue is the gist of the complaint here made.\nWant of notice to his agent is raised as entitling the late the Honourable J. S. C. W\u00fcrtele to make this complaint. Before consideration can be given to such want of notice it ought to be shewn by proof beyond doubt, which is not the case here, that such want of notice was the cause of the money not being in the hands of the agent W\u00fcrtele to pay the premium in question. The right to claim either notice or relief by reason of omission to give such notice can only rest upon a legal equity. The agent here to be notified being the agent of him who complains, seems to suggest that it does not lie in his mouth to raise such question or questions.\nThe logical result of holding the appellants bound to notify Charles J. C. W\u00fcrtele under penalty of forfeiting the security of sureties would be that if the late the Honourable J. S. W\u00fcrtele had for want of this notice and by reason of its absence collected the rents and used them for the whole term of the mortgage he would be discharged in law as the rents were lost and not available to discharge the debt.\nIt is urged that the agent Charles J. C. W\u00fcrtele became by the words of this document the agent of the appellants.\nHe speaks of himself throughout his evidence as his brother's agent, beginning thus:\nQuestion.\u2014Previous to the first loan for seven thousand five hundred dollars, and previous to the second loan for two thousand five hundred dollars made to Mr. Jonathan W. L. W\u00fcrtele, the borrower, you were the agent of the Seigniory of Bourg Marie de l'Est?\nAnswer.\u2014I was the agent since eighteen hundred and seventy-two.\nQuestion.\u2014After these loans, were you retained as agent to collect the rents?\nAnswer.\u2014I have collected them all the time, ever since eighteen hundred and seventy-two.\nQuestion.\u2014Did the Trust and Loan Company make known to you the loan made to Mr. W\u00fcrtele, and the transfer of the rents to the Trust and Loan Company?\nAnswer.\u2014Well I cannot say that the Trust and Loan Company made it known to me, bat my brother, the plaintiff in this case, informed me of it. And again:\nQuestion.\u2014You are still the agent of Judge W\u00fcrtele, are you not?\nAnswer.\u2014Yes, I am.\nQuestion.\u2014And you have been his agent for how long did you say?\nAnswer.\u2014Since eighteen hundred and seventy-two.\nQuestion.\u2014And during all the interval?\nAnswer.\u2014During all the interval, yes.\nAnd again at page 92 of case:\nMy brother told me not to make any distinction between those and the lots that were transferred, so the whole thing coming together always came to more than the amount of the schedule rents.\nAnd at page 93:\nQuestion.\u2014What were the expenses of collection in each year?\nAnswer.\u2014Well, I cannot say for each seigniory, because I collect\nQuestion.\u2014(Interrupting)\u2014I am talking about one seigniory.\nAnswer.\u2014I cannot say. I am paid a block sum for collecting on all the seigniories that my brother owns\u2014my brother owns another seigniory there, far larger than this one transferred. I am still his agent for that, and I am paid for both together, a block sum, so I cannot specify which is for which.\nAnd at page 93:\nQuestion.\u2014Now, you stated that yon continued to remain the agent of the plaintiff in this case?\nAnswer.\u2014Yes, for this and other seigniories I was telling you of, River David.\nQuestion.\u2014Those several seigniories?\nAnswer.\u2014He has those two.\nQuestion.\u2014Besides the one mortgaged to the Trust and Loan Company?\nAnswer.\u2014Yes, one besides that. I continued as his agent the same as before.\nQuestion.\u2014You are agent for the mills, farms, and the collection of rents?\nAnswer.\u2014Yes.\nQuestion.\u2014Seigniorial rents?\nAnswer.\u2014Yes.\nHe was paid a block sum of two hundred dollars annually by his brother for collecting all, including rents here in question.\nSuch being the nature of the agency how can it be said that there was or was intended to be created any privity between the appellants and this agent of the institute respondent? He was not a party to this contract.\nThe appellants are forbidden by the express terms of the contract to meddle with the existing relations of the agent to the seigniory unless default be made in the required payments or repayments.\nThe parties all agree Charles W\u00fcrtele is to continue in such agency subject to an option of dismissal by appellants if he failed to collect and pay.\nBut surely this did not deprive either the institute or the borrower of the right to pay by either of their own hands and from such other sources as they or either of them had the money that would fall due.\nIt would seem to me unwarranted officiousness for the appellants to have assumed that such default would have to be anticipated by serving a formal notice upon the agent before any moneys fell due, and especially so as the first premium had been paid by the borrower after this security had been given, and the borrower and his sureties expressly undertook that the appellants were not to be responsible to either of them but that the borrower and sureties were to be liable for the acts and deeds of the said \" agent \" and to answer personally such responsibility.\nThe hypothecation of this insurance policy was peculiarly for the protection of the sureties. The lenders were secured otherwise and as to them its maintenance was a burthen. Was it not the duty of the institute to instruct his own agent if he desired to keep such a security on foot? By what right should he for whose benefit it might be needed transfer his burthen on to the appellants?\nAll these considerations I submit tend to repel the implication of any legal obligation binding appellants to pay the premiums or to give notice to the agent Charles J. C. W\u00fcrtele to pay it and see that he did so. If the proper interpretation of this contract supplies no express contract to pay, and the implications arising from it and the relation of the parties as seen in light thereof and the surrounding facts seem to repel any implication of such a character, is there anything in the law governing the relations of creditor and surety that raises such a duty as is claimed here? Or, does the weight of authority not go the other way?\nStrange v. Fooks ([11]): Where security was lost by reason of the creditor's failure to perfect the assignment of same by service of notice upon the trustees of the settlement;\nWa'son v. Allcock ([12]): Where a creditor omitted to file a warrant of attorney that the agreement and circumstances called upon him to do, and the security was lost as a result;\nCapel v. Butler ([13]): Where creditor had failed to register an assignment of a ship;\nWulff v. Jay ([14]): Where creditor failed to register bill of sale and having so failed did not cover that initial default by taking possession of the goods as he might have done;\nAnd Beliveau v. Morelle ([15]), of same nature and others like unto these all rest upon the failure to perfect the security that all parties were agreed upon should be made so and were acts necessary to the perfecting of the security and peculiarly within the power of the creditor to have done.\nThe duty there springs up manifestly in accord with reason and justice.\nIf the appellants had failed to intimate to the insurance company the assignment here and loss had happened by reason of the borrower transferring to others the parallel would be complete. Or if the appellants were not relieved from publication, and by reason thereof the rents had been collected from the censitaires by a subsequent assignee and the substitute surety applied to be relieved, the parallel would be complete.\nBut in the case I put, though the substitute surety might claim relief how could the institute surety, who in such supposed case would be the party getting the money and producing the loss, complain?\nHow much less can he here where the step to be taken was not to perfect the instrument or security but to collect and pay or to repay the premium.\nThe notice of the agent of the institute to provide funds could have been given by the institute or other party concerned.\nOnce the security is perfected, as it was here, or as we may fairly for the present purpose assume it was as no injurious result came from want of publication, there rested no further duty, for which authority can be found, upon the appellants to pay the premiums needed for preservation of the policy or to remind the institute surety or his agent of the need to do so.\nWhat was said by Lord Eldon in Eyre v. Everett ([16]), where forbearance to sue was claimed as relieving the surety, that\nthe surety has no right to say that he is discharged from the debt which he has engaged to pay, together with the principal, if all that he rests upon is the passive conduct of the creditor in not suing,\nmay well be applied here.\nIt has since been applied in or to many modifications of circumstances in regard to passive conduct of a creditor in relation to preservation of securities and in all these instances I have found if nothing more existed the result has been in favour of the creditor and against the surety.\nSee, amongst others, the following:\u2014Macdonald v. Bell ([17]), at pages 332 and 333, where the money was much more certainly available upon mere notice of the demand than here and for want of which the security-was lost, yet the highest court of appeal held that not having been lost by a positive act but by an omission the sureties were not relieved; Carter v. White ([18]), at page 670, where the surety was not discharged merely by the negligence of the creditor to fill in the drawer's name and give notice of the bill as the surety might do it; Coates v. Coates ([19]), where the Master of the Rolls expressly held that a creditor was not bound to pay insurance premiums in absence of express contract to do so, and that sureties were not, for want of it, discharged; Mayor of Kingston-upon-Hull v. Harding ([20]), where plaintiff who had a right to superintend and a right to retain part of the money drawn upon a building contract did neither and yet sureties were not discharged. See also Queen v. Fay ([21]) at pages 615 and 627: Black v. Ottoman Bank ([22]) where similar law is laid down. See Colebrooke on Collateral Securities, pages 424,425 and 428, and cases cited there; deColyar, pages 334, 335 and 336, and case scited there; Killoran v. Sweet ([23]), Rees v. Berrington ([24]) page 599 et seq.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs against the estate of the late Honourable J. S. C. Wur-tele.\nAs to the other plaintiff it was alleged by counsel for appellants and seemed not to be denied that there was some mistake in the entry of judgment, and that apart from the liability of the late Honourable J. S. C. W\u00fcrtele's estate as surety the claim of the other surety to be relieved and the claim of the appellants against both sureties is not ripe for consideration. The conclusions in the pleadings and the reservation in the cross action or counterclaim of appellants would seem to bear this out to the extent at all events of making it inexpedient to deal here with the liability of the respondent Ernest F. W\u00fcrtele. One surety being relieved sometimes has the effect of relieving another, but that can not operate in this case where the surety was himself a party to the fault that may have relieved the other. I do not desire to be held as expressing opinion in regard to the other.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants : Branchaud & Kavanagh.\nSolicitors for the respondents : Angers, DeLorimier & Godin.\n[1] Q.

In an action by her representatives to recover damages from the ferry company on account of negligence in failing to provide proper means to prevent accidents at their wharf, the jury found that the drowning was caused by the fault of the company \"in not having proper gates at the gangway openings leading from the pontoon to the boat,\" and that deceased was herself negligent \" by her imprudence in attempting to board the boat after the gangway had been raised and the boat was swinging preparatory to leaving the pontoon,\" but that she \"was not then aware that the boat had left the wharf.\"\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (Girouard J. dissenting, on a different appreciation of the facts), that, as there was no proof of any negligence on the part of the company which proximately and effectively contributed to the accident, but, on the contrary, it appeared that the sole, direct, proximate and effective cause of the accident was the wilful and rash act of the deceased in attempting to jump aboard the ferry boat over the bulwarks, after the gangways had been withdrawn and the boat had got under way, the company could not be held responsible in damages. Tooke v. Bergeron (27 Can. S. C. R. 567) and T\\he George Matthews Co. v. Bouchard (28 Can. S. C. R. 585) followed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review at Quebec, which ordered judgment to be entered for the plaintiff on the verdict of the jury at the trial on a case reserved for the consideration of that court by the trial judge.\nThe action was brought by the tutor of a minor child of the deceased, Annie Jess, widow of Edouard Loiseau, who was drowned under the circumstances mentioned in the head-note, to recover damages on behalf of said minor, on the ground that the accident resulted from the gross negligence of the company in failing to place proper guards on their pontoon wharf to secure the safety of the public making use of their ferry boats and leaving the wharf insufficiently lighted and in neglecting to have men there to assist and warn the passengers.\nThe questions submitted to the jury and their answers, so far as they are material to the issues on the present appeal, are as follows;\u2014\n\"Second question\u2014Was the drowning of the said Annie Jess caused by fault, neglect or want of care on the part of the defendants ? If so, what was such fault, neglect or want of care ?\n\"Answer\u2014Yes, by not having proper gates at the gangway openings, leading from the pontoon to the boats.\n\"Third question\u2014Was the said Annie Jess guilty of any fault or negligence leading to her death ? If so, what; and specially did she attempt to board the defendant's ferryboat after it had left its wharf, and, if so, was she then aware it had left it ?\n\"Answer\u2014Yes, by her imprudence in attempting to board the boat after the gangway had been raised and the boat was swinging preparatory to leaving the pontoon.\n\" The said Annie Jess was not then aware that the boat had left wharf.\n\" Fourth question\u2014Had the defendants taken proper precautions for the due protection of the public against such accidents; if not, what precautions had the defendants omitted to take ?\n\" Answer\u2014No; in not having proper gates at the gangway opening leading from the pontoon to the boats. The jury would recommend that the company provide proper gates at the gangway leading to the boats from the pontoon for the general safety of the public.\n\"Fifth question\u2014If the jury find the defendants liable, what sum do they find the said minor child, Mabell Jess, entitled to, as being the damage caused her by the death of her mother ?\n\" The jury finds the company defendants liable in the sum of one thousand dollars.\"\nThe trial judge, Andrews J., reserved the case under article 491 C. P. Q. for the consideration of the Court of Review, stating the following reasons:\n\" 1. By the answer of the jury to the second question to them submitted they find the defendants in fault in ' not having proper gates at the gangway openings leading from the pontoon to the boats,' and by their answer to the fourth question the jury repeat that imputation of fault. But I entertain doubts: (a) Whether this is a matter covered by the plaintiffs declaration. (b) Whether there was any legal obligation on the defendants to have such gates. (c) Whether the absence of such gates can be considered a fault causing the death of Annie Jess.\n\"2. I entertain doubts (a) Whether the fact found by the jury in their answer to the third question viz: that the said Annie Jess attempted ' to board the boat after the gangway had been raised and the boat was swinging preparatory to leaving the pontoon' does not deprive the plaintiff of all recourse. (b) Whether there was any evidence to justify the jury in finding that the said Annie Jess was not then aware that the boat had left the wharf.' \"\nIn the Court of Review the plaintiff moved for judgment on the verdict, and the defendants moved for judgment dismissing the action or in the alternative for a new trial. By the judgment of the Court of Review (Andrews J., dissenting) the defendants' motion for a non-suit or a new trial was dismissed with costs and judgment ordered to be entered for the amount of the verdict in favour of the plaintiff with costs. On appeal to the Court of King's Bench the judgment of the Court of Review was affirmed, Boss\u00e9 J. dissenting, and the defendants now assert the present appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe material questions at issue upon this appeal are referred to in the judgment of the majority of the court, as delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Davies.\nStuart K.C. for the appellants. Alex. Taschereau K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nDavies J.\u2014The court is of the opinion, Girouard J. dissenting as to facts, that this appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed.\n\"We are also of the opinion after careful consideration of the evidence that the defendant's motion for a nonsuit at the close of the plaintiffs case should have been granted. There was no evidence on which the finding of the jury could be sustained which held that the death of the unfortunate woman, Mrs. Loiseau, called in the pleadings Dame Annie Jess, was directly caused or effectively contributed to by any negligence of the defendant company or its servants.\nThe facts are few and simple. The defendant is a ferry company whose steamers ply between Quebec and Levis. The late Mrs. Loiseau was a passenger on these steamers and, on the evening of the accident, was returning to Quebec from Levis accompanied by her sister Alice Jess and one Joseph Rankin. These three persons passed through the gates at the head or entrance of the ferry gangway, paid their fares and hearing the boat's whistle ran down the gangway and on to the floating pontoon, alongside of which the boats lie, hoping to be in time to get aboard. When they reached the end of the pontoon they saw that the steamer's bow had swung out and off from the pontoon, that the gangway by which passengers entered the boat had been withdrawn from its position and raised up on the steamer, as part of her bulwarks, thus effectually debarring passengers from entering, and that the steamer was under way. The stern of the ferry boat was only a couple of feet or a little more from the wharf and the sister, Alice Jess, jumped with the object of getting aboard over and across the bulwarks of the steamer. Her feet seemed to have landed on the guard which runs outside of the bulwarks level with the deck. She was caught by one of the passengers aboard the boat in his arms and dragged on board. She says she cannot say whether, but for his timely assistance, she also would not have fallen into the water or whether she landed on the top of the rail or on the guard which ran around the boat. Mrs. Loiseau followed right after her sister but was not so fortunate. She seems to have struck against an upright stanchion, but at any rate she fell backward into the water and, notwithstanding every effort to rescue her, was drowned. Rankin did not jump but remained on the pontoon. The bulwark's rail was eighteen inches or two feet higher than the pontoon. The boat was at least two feet away from the pontoon and under way when Mrs. Loiseau jumped. The gangway drawn up and forming part of the bulwarks effectually prevented any access to the boat except over the rails of the bulwarks. The attempt of these two woman to jump aboard at this time and under these circumstances cannot, we think, be characterised better than by calling it reck-less imprudence. Nothing but superior skill and strength on the part of the women or the assistance of third persons could, under the circumstances, have avoided an accident. Some men aboard, who saw them, gave evidence that they shouted warnings to the women not to jump but the warnings do not appear to have been heard. The unfortunate woman's wilful imprudence was the direct cause of her death. The jury found, in answer to questions put to them, \u2014first that the drowning of Mrs. Loiseau (Annie Jess), was caused by the fault of the defendants in not having proper gates at the gangway openings leading from the pontoon to the boats; and, secondly, that she was herself guilty of fault or negligence leading to her death\nby her imprudence in attempting to board the boat after the gangway had been raised and the boat was swinging preparatory to leaving the pontoon. The said Annie Jess was not then aware that the boat had left the wharf.\nIt was proved in evidence that, for some time previously to the accident, the company had been accustomed to put a chain across the opening leading from the pontoon to the steamer about four or five feet back from the outside edge of the pontoon, and that upon this occasion the chain was not put across through some negligence on the part of the company's servants.\nThe plaintiff contended vigorously and the court below found that this was negligence contributory to the accident, and that, therefore, according to the law of Quebec, the company Was liable for part of the damages.\nThe company denied any obligation on their part to put up this chain or any negligence in their servants having omitted to put it up on the night in question.\nWhether it was an obligation on their part to put up the chain or negligence in omitting to do so at the time in question we are not called upon to decide. We certainly do not intend by our judgment to say that there was not such an obligation or that in a case where any passenger was injured or lost his life by reason of the absence of such a precaution the company would not be liable.\nWhat we do hold is that to make such negligence (assuming it to be such) available to the plaintiff in this action as a contributory cause of the accident, it must be shewn to be a proximate and effective cause.\nThere is no evidence in this case on which such a finding could be made. The sole, direct, proximate and effective cause of Mrs. Loiseau's death was her wilful and rash act in attempting to jump aboard the ferry boat over the bulwarks after the passenger gangway had been withdrawn and raised up so as effectually to prevent passengers going on board and after the steamboat had got under way.\nSuppose Annie Jess or Mrs. Loiseau, in attempting to jump on board the ferry boat over and across the bulwark rail, had slipped on the rail and fallen to the deck breaking her arm or leg. Could it be successfully contended that the company was liable in such a case? And yet the same method of reasoning as that adopted by the plaintiff in this case would, if accepted, create such liability.\nThe absence of the chain did not induce, or cause the deceased to jump or attempt to jump on board. That act was found by the jury to be an imprudent one. It was no doubt that, but it was more, it was a wilfully reckless act, and the one which solely and proximately caused her death.\nIt was argued that if the chain had been there it probably would have stopped her altogether or at any rate delayed her and caused her to pause and think before attempting to make the jump. But there was no causal connection between the absence of the chain and the fatal act of jumping. So in a slightly remoter degree might it be argued that if the deceased had been stopped at the top of the gangway and not allowed to go down upon the pontoon after the steamer had whistled, her death would have been prevented. It is sufficient to say that such remote negligence as the absence of the chain, the only negligence on the part of the company insisted on at bar, not being the direct and effective cause of the accident, is not such negligence as to make the company liable.\nThe law governing, the case is the same in the Province of Quebec as in the rest of Canada.\nIn the case of Tooke v. Bergeron ([1]), in which Mr. Justice Girouard delivered the judgment of the court, it was held that:\nWhere an employee sustains injuries, the employer, although he may be in default, cannot be held responsible in damages unless it is shewn that the accident by which the injuries were caused was directly due to his neglect.\nAnd the present Chief Justice, then Taschereau J., said in The George Matthews Co. v. Bouchard. ([2]), at pages 584-585;\u2014\nIt seems to be taken for granted that because there was an accident and because there was an act of negligence it follows that the plaintiff has proved his case. Now that is not the law; * * * The evidence might be consistent with his theory but it is equally consistent, to say the least, with the theory that the accident was due to his own carelessness, and it is a rule that where the evidence is as consistent with one state of facts as with another it proves neither. We adopt this as a correct statement of the law. For these reasons we think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting)\u2014I believe that the principal cause of the accident was the want of a chain or guard, and for that reason I do not feel inclined to disturb the verdict of the jury.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants : Caron, Pentland, Stuart& Brodie.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Fitzpatrick, Parent, Taschereau, Roy & Cannon.\n[1] 27 Can.

Lepitre v. The Citizens Light and Power Company (29 Can. S. C. R. 1) referred to by Nesbitt J.\nIn such a case it is not sufficient defence to shew that the person injured had knowledge of the risks of his employment but there must be such knowledge shewn as, under the circumstances, leaves no doubt that the risk was voluntarily incurred and this must be found as a fact. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at the City of Montreal, whereby the judgment of the trial court, Robidoux J., was reversed and the plaintiffs action was maintained with costs.\nThe appellant company operates an electric tramway in the District of Montreal, in connection with which they have also a telephone system the wires of which are attached to poles which also serve to support electric feed-wires and the trolley by which the tramway is supplied with motive power. The plaintiff was a lineman employed by the company for the purpose of doing work on the telephone wires; he was shewn to have had considerable experience at this kind of work but it did not clearly appear whether or not he had ever worked at it in places where he might be exposed to the greater risks of coming in contact with wires highly charged with electric currents, such as would be necessary for the operation of a tramway. At the time of the accident by which plaintiff's injuries were caused, the company was replacing their old trolley wire by a new one which had not yet been put in place but was attached by tie-wires to the iron brackets on which the trolley in use was suspended in such a manner that it had become charged with high currents of electricity which passed from the new trolley into the brackets rendering them \"hot\", i.e. charging them, likewise, with the same high electric currents. The pole at which the accident occurred had a number of wires attached to it in addition to the feed wire and trolleys; it was crooked and difficult to climb and, in order to strengthen it, was supported by a back-stay or guy-wire wrapped round the pole and fastened to an iron holdfast driven into the ground. This guy-wire was not insulated but, while the pole was dry, was not in danger of becoming charged with electricity. The plaintiff, while working upon another pole, had been warned that the brackets were \"hot\" and told \"not to stand on the bracket while he was handling the telephone wires. \" He was ordered by the foreman to climb the pole where the accident occurred, without further warning, and, in taking hold of the bracket to assist himself, in some way received two electric shocks which caused him to loosen his hold on the pole with one hand which came in contact with the uninsulated guy-wire. He was precipitated to the ground and injured and the theory was advanced that, in thus touching the uninsulated guy-wire, the electric circuit grounded through his body and threw him down. The company had not supplied him with non-conducting gloves, such as are usually supplied to linemen working among highly charged wires.\nThe plea was to the effect that it was not usual to supply such gloves to employees working on telephone wires with low currents of electricity, that plaintiff was an experienced man aware of the risks of his employment, that he had been warned about the \"hot\" brackets and that, by disregarding these repeated warnings, he imprudently and voluntarily incurred the danger and was alone responsible for the cause of his injuries.\nIn the Superior Court, the trial judge, Robidoux J., adopted the views propounded by the defence and dismissed the action, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Review, oh the ground that the company was at fault for neglecting to give the plaintiff the protection to which he was entitled in performing such dangerous work. The Court of Review, however, found that the plaintiff had contributed to the accident and, in accordance with the practice in the Province of Quebec, reduced the damages accordingly to $750. On an appeal by the company to the Court of King's Bench, that court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Review, and held that the company had been negligent\u2014\n\" (1) In not insulating the wires of the back-stay; (2) in not informing the respondent of this fact and of the danger to which he was exposed in climbing a pole like the present one when it could not be ignored how difficult it must have been to avoid touching, at one and the same time, the brackets and the wires at the back-stay, specially when a slip of the spurs (worn for the purpose of climbing poles) or any false move might have rendered that result quite unavoidable.\"\nThe court below also said:\u2014\n\" We must also add that the accident might have been avoided if the company had given respondent the rubber gloves ordinarily used for that kind of work or if the new trolley had been tied up to the bracket with a dry rope.\"\nMeredith K. C. and Holden for the appellants.\nBrooke K. C. and Hiving for the respondent.\nSEDGEWICK and GIROUARD JJ. were of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Davies.\nDAVIES J \u2014I concur in the dismissal of this appeal, It is sufficient that it was clearly established, to my mind, that negligence on the part of the company or its officers was the direct cause of the plaintiff's injuries. They failed to take that reasonable care and provide themselves with those reasonable precautions which it was their duty to take and provide with reference to an employee engaged in the extremely dangerous work of stringing electric wires along their poles. He was ordered by the foreman to go up one of the poles to attend to some wiring at a time when the ordinary insulation of the bracket connecting the pole with the over-head trolley wire had been destroyed and while the bracket was \"hot.\" He was not supplied with gloves. A guy-wire attached to and supporting the pole was not insulated, and the foreman refused to disconnect the new trolley wire which was being strung from the bracket to which it was attached even for the few moments the plaintiff was working upon the post.\nWhile there is some discrepancy between the witnesses as to the precise warning given to him, the man himself swears that he was only warned \" not to stand on the bracket while he was handling the telephone wires.\" He did not disobey the warning but, apparently, when taking hold of the bracket to assist himself up, an act agreed upon by counsel for the company as not per se dangerous, he received a shock which caused him to loosen one of his arms which came in contact with the grounded and uninsulated guy-wire. This contact completed the circuit and he was thrown to the ground and injured. This is the theory of the cause of the accident adopted by the courts below and I accept it, under the evidence, as the true one.\nThe counsel for the appellant contended that the plaintiff had experience and knowledge of the risk he was running, but, even if he had, which I doubt, such knowledge would not, of itself, absolve the company from liability. It must be such a knowledge as, under the circumstances, leaves no inference open but the one that the workman had voluntarily incurred the risk and that must be found as a fact. The circumstances, in this case, are far from leaving any such inference open and the defence fails. NESBITT J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed.\nI desire to draw attention to the fact that the head-note of the case of The Citizens Light and Power Company v. Lepitre ([1]) is based merely upon an oral opinion of the Chief justice in that case. That expression was not necessary to the decision of the case which simply proceeded upon the fact that the company had failed to provide ordinary appliances in such a dangerous work. I certainly would not concur, as at present advised, in the expression of opinion by the Chief Justice. I think the doctrine there laid down is only applicable as between a company carrying on such a dangerous employment and third parties.\nI do not, myself, see any difference between an employee of an electric company and any other employee, other than that, owing to the extreme hazard of the work, precautions proportionately commensurate with the danger would have to be taken by the employer under the ordinary rule of law requiring reasonable care. The duty is the same in each case; the evidence of the performance of the duty must necessarily vary according to the circumstances.\nIn this case, the evidence is quite clear that reasonable precautions, such as were ordinarily adopted by other companies, were not taken, and, I think the view as to liability taken by the Court of King's Bench should be adopted.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I agree with the reasons stated by my brother Davies.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants : Campbell, Meredith, Mac-pherson & Hague.\nSolicitor for the respondent : Cramp & Ewing.\n[1] 29 Can.

Ord. 1902, ch. 38, ss. 1 and 2.\nThe effect of the second section of the Y'ukon ordinance, chapter 38, Consolidated Ordinances, 1902, is to remove the doctrine of pressure in respect to preferential assignments and, consequently, all assignments made by persons in insolvent circumstances come within the terms of the ordinance.\nIn order to render such an assignment void there must be knowledge of the insolvency on the part of both parties and concurrence of intention to obtain an unlawful preference over the other creditors. Molsons Bank v. Halter (18 Can. S. C. R. 88); Stephens v, McArthur (19 Can. S. C.B. 446); and Gibbons v. McDonald (20 Can. S. C. R. 587) referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Territorial Court of the Yukon Territory, in banco, affirming the judgment of Dugas J., at the trial dismissing the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe case is stated as follows, by Mr. Justice Craig, in delivering the judgment appealed from:\n\"This is an action brought by the plaintiffs to set aside several instruments as being void against creditors under chapter 38 of the Yukon Consolidated Ordinances, and also asking that the defendant bank be declared a trustee for Bossuyt of the property covered by the mortgage and assignments mentioned; that Finlaison be declared a trustee of certain property conveyed to him; that the bank be ordered to account for all the goods mortgaged or transferred and the moneys or proceeds realized by said bank under those various assignments; and a general account.\n\"The case has two main branches, one in which the plaintiffs attack the chattel mortgage, assignment of book accounts and notes, the other attacking the rate of interest charged by the bank and asking for an account of that interest and an allowance of the same, taken over seven per cent, for the benefit of the creditors.\n\"The pleadings set out that the plaintiffs were execution creditors on the 28th June, 1902, and simple contract creditors for a long period before that date; that the defendant Bossuyt was insolvent in October, 1901; that on the 1st of November, 1901, Bossuyt made a chattel mortgage to the bank to secure a past due debt of $41,550; that the bank took immediate pos-session of that property and disposed of it, this property consisting mainly of butchers meats; that land transferred to Finlaison, who was acting manager of the bank, was transferred to him as trustee to secure the same debt; that Bossuyt assigned debts in April and May, 1902, in all amounting to $20,000; that he indorsed and transferred promissory notes amounting in all to about $12,000 to secure the same debt; that no consideration was given but security for prior debts; that since October, 1898, Bossuyt borrowed from the bank moneys at 24 per cent per annum and afterwards at 18 per cent per annum, and that the bank wrongfully collected interest over and above the rate allowed by the Banking Act of 7 per cent ; that during this time Bossuyt was insolvent to the knowledge of the bank and that assignments were made voluntarily and with intent to defeat the plaintiffs and other creditors and were taken by the bank with such intent and to give a preference and had the effect of giving a preference to the bank over other creditors; that the assignments were made fraudulently for the purpose of defeating creditors and had that effect and are void; that if the assignments were good an account should be taken of the interest, and only 7 per cent allowed.\n\"The defendants deny these allegations generally, alleging that the book debts of Bossuyt, chattel mortgages, etc., and other assignments were taken as extra precaution and additional security; that the notes and book debts were transferred as collateral in the ordi-nary course of business; that the interest paid was settled and the account closed and the interest over and above the legal rate was voluntarily paid by Bossuyt long before action; and they allege that the execution creditors have no status to ask for an account, there being no privity between them and the bank in the matter of the interest; that the plaintiffs are not creditors within the meaning of the Act respecting preferential assignments.\n\"The evidence, I think, shews the following facts: That Bossuyt, the judgment debtor, in 1898 and 1899, was owing the plaintiffs a balance of $28,200; that the balance remains unpaid to date; that Bossuyt also owed Davies $9,000, secured by warehouse receipts before the assignment was made, and that he also owed one VanRass $500; and, further, that he owed Lafrance $17,000 in the fall of 1901; that from 1899 down he continued to borrow large sums of money from the bank amounting in all on the 1st of November, 1901, to about $41,000, there being a current note then matured of about $5,000 which was unpaid, not included in the then security; that on the 1st of November he gave a chattel mortgage to the bank covering stock of meat and fowl situate in Dawson; that between that time and April and May, 1902, the bank made other advances to him, and that additional security was taken by assignment of book debts and promissory notes. After the taking of the chattel mortgage in November Bossuyt was allowed to sell the meat. For about a month he took it away without the leave of the bank The bank manager observing this required the book-keeper, one Peck, who was acting in the service of Bossuyt, to keep check of the meats and pay over the proceeds to the bank, which was done. Bossuyt had a great deal of other meats in his warehouse; the meat of one Burns, about $8,000 worth or more, for which the bank advanced the money on the purchase; also the meat which was covered by a warehouse receipt to Davies, all of which was sold and turned into the general account of Bossuyt without any distinction or earmarking. Bossuyt, clearly in fraud of Davies, disposed of the entire stock of meat which Davies held as security for his advance and deprived him entirely of his money, without any knowledge on the part of the bank, however, and this money was paid over along with the other money realized from the sale of the meat which was purchased from Burns with the $8,000 advanced by the bank. During this time I take it that Lafrance was well aware (at least I draw that inference from the evidence) that Bossuyt was dealing with the bank ; he never mentioned to the bank the Bossuyt indebtedness to him even on the occasion when he indorsed a $9,000 note for Bossuyt in the fall of that year, which the bank discounted and paid over to him, although at that time it is quite clear from the evidence that the manager of the bank informed the plaintiff, Lafrance, that he had advanced up to the limit of Bossuyt's credit and assets, yet Lafrance never mentioned to the bank anything of his debt. It is also absolutely clear from the evidence that Bossuyt never in any way informed the bank of his other liabilities and the bank had no knowledge whatever in any way of the liabilities of Bossuyt beyond that to themselves. The manager of the bank in March, 1902, became aware of the Davies note of $9,000. It is quite clear that the bank charged 24 per cent interest on all the advances made up to December, 1901, and then the rate was reduced to 18 per cent. It is also in evidence that Bossuyt did not tell Lafrance of his large debt to the bank and Lafrance, it appears, never inquired although he knew that Bossuyt had dealings with the bank and that the bank required his indorsement before advancing $9,000.\n\"That the bank was ignorant of the financial condition of Bossuyt is quite apparent from this, that the manager swears that if he had been requested he would have loaned Bossuyt the further $9,000 to pay off the Davies note upon the security of the assets which he believed Bossuyt had. Bossuyt's evidence is not at all satisfactory, but this can be clearly drawn from it that he never informed the bank of his position and that the bank was ignorant of his real position; that he anticipated being able to pull through at the time of giving the chattel mortage that he went into a statement of his effects with the bank at that time, with the manager, and together they estimated he had about the sum of $95,000, and in view of what the bank knew of his position from that statement and otherwise, and being aware only of their own debt, Bossuyt was clearly not insolvent to the knowledge of the bank. Bossuyt carried on his business until June 28th, selling his meat as I have already recited, mixing all the moneys from the various sources of supply in the one general account. The bank certainly at that time became anxious about the large advances they were making and felt they should have security. The stock as valued by Bossuyt and the bank was taken at wholesale prices. Bossuyt today cannot give any very clear estimate of what he had, but he does not deny going over his stock with the manager of the bank and that the estimate that the bank manager now gives must be taken to be what was arrived at that time. Bossuyt admits that Lafrance knew he was borrowing from the bank in the fall of 1901 to pay for meat, and in that fall Bossuyt bought a very large consignment of meat from Lafrance, about $27,000 worth, on which he paid Lafrance $17,000 in cash borrowed from the bank, the balance being paid by a note discounted by Bossuyt and indorsed by Lafrance which is the note I previously referred to. Some considerable losses, which are not very clearly sworn to, but certainly losses which seriously affected Bossuyt, occurred in the winter of 1901 and 1902. Bossuyt says that so far as the bank knew he was solvent in 1901. Bossuyt admits signing the cheque monthly for the interest, as called upon, or otherwise. He says generally the cheques were written in the bank by the manager and he signed them. These cheques, as appears by the exhibits, ran from June 29th, 1901, on to February 8th, 1902, the first cheque being for $6,054, and being ear-marked \" Interest on notes to 30 June \", and so on at various dates monthly from that time on cheques were given to the bank on themselves and paid out of the general account which Bossuyt had whenever money was on hand. Some of the book debts assigned certainly were proceeds of the meat mortgaged and some of the notes the same, as well as other book debts contracted during the carrying on of Bossuyt's business.\nLafrance was called and his evidence was just about as I have given it summarized. He did not learn of Bossuyt's mortgage to the bank until February, 1902. He knew of several shipments all paid through the bank; he admits telling Finlaison that Bossuyt was all right, and that he never mentioned to the bank manager any claim of his against Bossuyt.\n\"The action was based upon the law contained in chapter 38 of our Ordinance which I had better give in full. Section 1 says :\u2014 'Every gift, conveyance, assignment or transfer, delivery over of payment of goods, chattels or effects or of bonds, bills, notes, securities or of shares, dividends, premiums, or bonuses in any bank, company or corporation made by any person at any time when he is in insolvent circumstances or is unable to pay his debts in full or knows that he is on the verge of insolvency, with intent to defeat or delay or prejudice his creditors, or to give to one or more of them a preference over his other creditors or over any or more of them, or which has such effect, shall, as against them be utterly void. 'Section 2:' Every such gift, conveyance, assignment, transfer, delivery over or payment, whether made owing to pressure or partly owing to pressure or not, which has the effect of defeating, delaying or prejudicing creditors or giving one or more of them a preference, shall, as against the other creditors of such debtor, be utterly void.' The title of the Bill is an 'Ordinance respecting Preferential Assignments', and the marginal note to section 1 is: 'Fraudulent and Preferential Assignments 'and the marginal note to section 2 is the word 'Pressure' at the foot. That section 2 was passed after the decision of Molson's Bank v Halttr ([1]).\"\nEwart K. C. for the appellants.\nShepley K. C. and Chrislie for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by IDINGTON J.\u2014It is urged by the appellants that the amendment by sec. 2 of ch. 38 of the Yukon Ordinances consolidated (1902) is such as to distinguish this case from the cases of Molsons Bank v. Haller ([2]), followed by Gibbons v. McDonald ([3]), that interpreted the R S. O. 1887, ch. 124, and Stephens v. McArthur ([4]), that interpreted the Manitoba Act 49 Vict. ch. 45, sec. 3, where the words used are identical with those of the Ontario Act.\nThe Yukon Ordinance before its amendment in question was almost identical with those of the Ontario and Manitoba statutes upon which these cases were respectively decided. The amendment now in question consists in adding to the 1st section the following as sec. 2:\n2. Every such gift, conveyance, assignment, delivery over or payment whether made owing to pressure or partly owing to pressure or not, which has the effect of defeating, delaying, or prejudicing creditors or giving one or more of them a preference shall as against the other creditors of such debtor be utterly void.\nThis was passed after the decision in Molsons Bank v. Haller ([5]).\nDoes it do more than remove the question of pressure out of consideration in arriving at a proper conclusion in a case falling within the first section which was practically passed upon by the decisions referred to I think not. \u201cEvery such gift, &c.\" evidently means that class or those classes designated by the preceding section.\nTake the doctrine of pressure out of the question by force of this amendment as it was taken by the facts in the case of Gibbons v. McDonald ([6]) and we have nothing left to distinguish this case from that. There the whole of the debtor's assets had been assigned as it is alleged by the appellants is the case here. I cannot read this amending section 2 of the Yukon Ordinance as doing more than striking at the doctrine of pressure. If the words \"whether made owing to pressure or partly owing to pressure\" had been inserted in the first section just after the word \"intent\" the same legal effect would have been produced.\nThe only other thing in this amending section is a repetition of the words \"which has such effect.\" That repetition adds nothing to the force of the words in the first section if we are to be governed, as I think we must, by the interpretation given by the cases I have referred to and the reasoning which lead to their decision. I need not refer at length to that reasoning. It is clearly set forth in the judgments of Mr. Justice Strong, especially at pp. 452 & 453 of Stephens v. McArthur ([7]). It would seem as if (here the removal of the doctrine of pressure, as an element of the reasoning leading to the conclusion reached, had been anticipated. It was, therefore, not necessary when the case of Gibbons v. McDonald ([8]) arose, without any fact in it upon which the doctrine of pressure could rest, to repeat this reasoning, and the same learned Justice simply contented himself with referring to his former judgment and the majority of the court concurred therein. It was there shown that the preference prohibited was a voluntary preference and hence a fraudulent preference.\nAnd if a fraudulent preference to whom is the having such a purpose to be attributed?\nIs it enough to shew that the assignor may have had such an intent?\nMust not the assignee as well as the assignor be a party to the fraudulent intent? Such would seem to be the result of a long line of decisions upon which the commercial world has had a right to act for a long time past. And though there may not have been any express decision of the point upon this legislation in this court the late Chief Justice, Sir William Ritchie, in Gibbons v. McDonald ([9]), at page 589 indicates that in his view there must be\na concurrence of intent on the one side to give and on the other to accept a preference over other creditors.\nCounsel for the appellants properly conceded that the evidence here did not show knowledge on the part of the bank such as would enable us to find this concurrence of purpose.\nUntil the legislature obliterates the element of intent in such legislation and clearly declares that, quite independently of intent, the preferential result or effect of the transaction impeached is to govern, it will be exceedingly difficult to arrive at any other conclusion in cases of this kind. The results that might flow from such legislation ought not to be brought about without such purpose being most clearly expressed by the legislature.\nThe appellants as execution creditors only, (not suing for all creditors), assert some rights of a novel character which, in the view I take, it is unnecessary to dispose of or pass upon.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: R.

Some time before the accident, after setting off a blast, the wall had been inspected by a competent person, under the personal direction of the pit foreman himself, and the particular spot from which the loose rock fell tested by sounding and prying with a crowbar and judged to be safe. In an action to recover damages the courts below inferred from the evidence that the wall of the pit had been allowed to remain in an unsafe condition, and held the defendants responsible on account of negligence in this respect. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, Girouard J. dissenting, that, as an inspection had been duly made by competent persons, using their best judgment in the honest discharge of their duty, who reported the wall to be secure, there could be no negligence imputed to the company in that respect, although it afterwards appeared that there had been error in judgment or in the manner in which the inspection was performed.\nHeld, also, Girouard J. dissenting, that where there is evidence that makes it unnecessary to draw inferences or rely upon presumptions from facts proved the findings of two courts below, which have acted upon such inferences or presumptions, should be reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review at the City of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Arthabaska, Choquette J., which maintained the plaintiff's action with costs. The action was brought by the widow of the late Thomas Tremblay, deceased, on her own behalf and as tutrix to her minor children, issue of her marriage with deceased, to recover damages on account of the death of her said husband, occasioned, as alleged, through the negligence of the company, defendants, in failing to provide a safe place for the workmen to carry on the work upon which they were employed by the company in their asbestos mines at Black Lake, in the District of Arthabaska. Deceased was the foreman in charge of the miners engaged in getting asbestos from a pit at the mines, which was about fifty feet in width and of about the same number of feet in depth. The asbestos was got by sinking levels of ten to fifteen feet, from time to time, in such a manner as to leave a bench or step from the walls of which the abestos and the rock in which it was found were blown off, by blasting, into the shaft and there trimmed by cutting away the rock. Shortly before the accident occurred blasts had been set off in one of the walls and, before taking the workmen down into the shaft again, this wall had been inspected by one H\u00e9bert, the steam driller, who was skilled in such work, under the directions of the deceased foreman, in order to ascertain that there were no loose pieces or rock hanging in the wall and liable to fall into the shaft and injure the men working there. The examination was made by letting H\u00e9bert down the side of the wall with ropes while he sounded the wall by striking it with a crow-bar to see that it was standing firmly. At one particular place, eight or ten feet above the bottom of the shaft, they observed a piece of rock which excited their suspicions as to its safety and H\u00e9bert tried to pry it out with the crow-bar but it remained, as he thought, firmly fixed in position by the rock wall surrounding it. He asked deceased to come down and make further examination, but deceased replied that if H\u00e9bert thought it safe it must be so and, accordingly, ordered the men to go down into the shaft and continue their work, he himself going down with them and setting to work at a point immediately beneath the suspicious place in the wall. After he had been working there for some time, stated at from half an hour' to an hour and a half, the rock in some manner became suddenly loosened, fell upon him and killed him. The accident was not seen by the other men working in the pit, but H\u00e9bert, who was sitting on the edge of the bench or step, saw the rock falling and gave evidence, on behalf of the plaintiff, as to how the accident had occurred.\nThe plaintiff alleged that the defendants were aware that this pit was in a dangerous condition, on account of cracks in the walls, that it had remained so for a long time in spite of complaints and that the defendants had taken no steps to remove the danger. The defence was that the mine was not dangerous, that the mining was carefully conducted, that deceased was an experienced man, that, in the usual discharge of one of his duties as foreman of the pit, he had, after the blasting, made an inspection of the wall and concluded that it was safe.\nThe trial court judge adopted the contentions of the plaintiff as being sustained by the evidence as to the general condition of the walls, from which it must, in his view, be inferred that the pit or shaft was not being worked with due regard to the safety of the men employed there. This judgment was affirmed, on appeal, by the Court of Review, Cimon J. dissenting\nStuart K.C. and Francis McLennan K.C. for the appellants.\nLaflamme and J. E. Perrault for the respondent. The judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent seeks to support this judgment on the simple ground that, though H\u00e9bert, the witness who saw the accident and knew more than all others as to the immediate causes and conditions leading thereto and was called by the plaintiff to testify, swore he exercised his best judgment and care in respect of the very stone that is in question, yet as it fell without apparent cause within half an hour or an hour and a half after his inspection there is such presumption of neglect on his part as to entitle us to discard his evidence and act upon the presumption. I cannot accede to this. The plaintiff in calling H\u00e9bert is supposed by law to put him forward as a credible witness. It is also shown he was a competent man. The factum of the respondent asserts this also. Tremblay, the deceased, had some opportunity to discern from the position of the stone and its general external appearance whether or not the general want of repair alleged to have existed in the mine would likely affect this particular stone and its next neighbours. He acted as if satisfied that there was not in the general condition of things that danger which is now alleged.\nThere cannot be imputed neglect if competent men exercise their best judgment and honestly discharge their duty even when that best judgment and duty done may turn out to have been mistaken. If there had been no inspection of this stone and H\u00e9bert had not given evidence and we were left to draw inferences from the facts given as to the generally dangerous character of the mine and general want of trimming of its walls, we might be driven to rely on presumption or feel inclined not to interfere with those presumptions others had acted upon. But we cannot on this, which counsel admitted to be all he had to go upon, let that sort of presumption prevail against the direct evidence.\nI think the appeal must be allowed with costs.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting)\u2014I do not feel inclined to reverse the judgment of the two courts below upon a mere question of fact, as there is some evidence in support of their finding which is pointed out in their judgments.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants : McLennan & Howard.\nSolicitors for the respondents : Perrault & Perrault\n",

Co. agreed, for three years from the date thereof, to purchase for their business surgical instruments manufactured by The K.S. Co. only, the latter contracted to supply their products at \u201clowest wholesale prices\u201d and for all goods furnished from New York to allow a special discount of 5 per cent from the prices marked in a catalogue handed over with the contract.\nHeld, that under this agreement The K.S. Co. could allow to purchasers of their goods in large quantities a greater discount from the wholesale prices than 5 per cent without being obliged to give the same reduction to the C. & M. Co.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note and in the written opinions of the judges on this appeal.\nR.F. Smith K.C. and Blackstock K.C. (Riddell K.C. with them) for the appellants, referred to Lindley v. Lacey[1]; Wilson v. Windsor Foundry Co[2]; Dunsmuir v. Lowenberg, Harris & Co.[3]; Bank of England v. Vagliano[4]. Shepley K.C. and Middleton for the respondents cited Ewart on Estoppel pp. 68-70; Jorden v. Money[5]; Chadwick v. Manning[6].\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I concur with hesitation.\nDAVIES J.\u2014After a careful study of the evidence given by the respective parties and their witnesses and the judgments of the courts below I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with the usual results.\nI agree with the several findings of the trial judge as to the effect of the verbal conversations between the parties which preceded the preparation and entering into of the agreement of January and of the subsequent correspondence of February.\nThe written agreement entered info by the parties after prolonged interviews and consultations and from notes or memoranda prepared by the plaintiffs themselves contained no stipulation as to the establishment by the plaintiffs in Canada of a Canadian wholesale stock, and the conversations between the parties coupled with the written correspondence afterwards entirely failed in my opinion to establish any such collateral agreement. There were, no doubt, repeated statements on the part of the plaintiffs that it was their intention, part of their business policy, to establish such a branch, but there was no contract on their part binding them to do so. The plaintiffs, I think it is established, fully intended to do so as part of their business policy and the defendants assumed that they would and acted on the assumption. But it was quite open to the plaintiffs on the agreements made between the parties to change their minds and their policy as regards the establishment of this Canadian stock as subsequent changes of circumstances seemed to make it desirable for them to do so, without being liable to the defendants for any damages.\nI do not think it necessary to go into the facts in detail as they are recited at length by the Chief Justice who tried the case and fully summarized in the judgment of the Court of Appeal. With these judgments on this branch of the case I fully concur. See the cases of Jorden v. Money[7]; Rhodes v. Forwood[8]; The Queen v. Demiers[9]; Chadwick v. Manning[10]; Ewart on Estoppel, pp. 689.\nThis conclusion practically disposes of the appeal, but there were some minor questions relating to the delivery of the catalogues and to the correctness of the prices at which the goods were charged defendants which were argued at some length.\nOn the question of the delivery of the catalogues I never entertained any doubt as to the conclusion of the Court of Appeal being the proper one.\nOn the other question respecting the wholesale prices charged defendants I have had considerable doubt. The contract provided for the sale by the plaintiffs to the defendants of their products \u201cat lowest wholesale prices.\u201d The clause reads as follows:\nThe Kny-Scheerer Company will supply Chandler & Massey, Limited, their products at lowest wholesale prices.\nFor all goods to be furnished from New York a special discount of five per cent will be allowed as a special inducement from the prices marked in the confidential wholesale catalogue which is handed to them with this contract. For all goods to be furnished from Montreal, either from Canadian stock or upon direct shipment from European factory, new prices will be made as soon as possible on the entire line and be subjected to the same discount.\nIt is not contended by the defendants that they were charged higher prices than those mentioned in the catalogue for the goods purchased in New York, or that the new prices charged for the goods obtained by defendants from the Canadian stock of plaintiffs were higher than the lowest wholesale prices charged other customers of plaintiffs. The discount to be allowed off the prices mentioned in the catalogue as also off those \u201cnew prices to be made\u201d on Canadian stock was fixed at five per cent and the defendants\u2019 contention, as I understand it, is that inasmuch as the evidence shewed the plaintiffs had allowed to a few of their customers who purchased their goods in very large quantities a greater discount than five per cent off the wholesale prices they, the defendants, were entitled to the increased or greater discount under the terms of their agreement.\nThe plaintiffs on the other hand submitted, and the trial judge and Court of Appeal upheld the submission, that while the true construction of the agreement entitled the defendants to the goods purchased by them at the lowest wholesale prices it did not entitle them to any higher discount than the five per cent expressly stipulated for and that nothing in the agreement prohibited the plaintiffs from allowing to other purchasers of their goods, not of the same class as defendants but buyers of very much larger quantities of goods, a greater discount than the stipulated discount provided for defendants without allowing them to share in such increased discount. In other words, so long as it was not a mere cloak or device for covering up a sale of goods at lower wholesale prices than those charged defendants, but was a bon\u00e2 fide discount allowed in consideration of the quantity of goods pur- chased, the plaintiffs could allow the additional discount beyond the five per cent without being compelled to concede same to defendants.\nI fully agree with the courts below that the prices and discounts charged and allowed by plaintiffs in their dealings with their branch firms cannot be considered in determining the meaning of the clause.\nThe Court of Appeal seem to have considered that the parties themselves had by their actions and conduct put a construction on the agreement adverse to that now contended for by defendants and that in view of the dealings between the parties extending over a period of twenty months, and the numerous disputes and adjustments of the charges in the invoices rendered during that time from plaintiffs to defendants, it was now too late for the latter to attempt to open up these prices thus adjusted, fixed and settled by the parties.\nWhile entertaining doubts as to the proper construction of the clause I do not feel that I would be justified under the facts in reversing the conclusions of the courts below, which I cannot say are clearly erroneous.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nNESBITT J.\u2014Had it not been that no useful purpose is attained by dissenting, I should have held that, in my view, the contract was based upon the agreement that an export stock should be established and maintained in Montreal and afterwards in Toronto. I do not think it was intention; I think it was bargain and I view the case as just one more instance of a party suffering for the general good by the enforcement of the salutary rule that business men should be careful to have their understandings in writing. Jorden v. Money[11] is relied upon by the respondent as shewing that no matter how strongly one represents he intends to do so or so and induces another to act to his prejudice, he can, in breach of all principles governing men of common honesty, abandon his intentions. Such is the law, apparently, but I would unhesitatingly say, here, it was not intention but bargain. However, as the majority are for affirming I concur, as I assume I must be in error in my view.\nIdington J. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Beatty, Blackstock, Fasken, Riddell & Mabee.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Macdonald, Shepley, Middleton & Donald.\n[1] 17 C.B.N.S. 578.\n[2] 31 Can.

Notwithstanding anything in the Act heretofore passed by Parliament, no railway company within the jurisdiction or legislative power or control of Parliament shall be relieved from liability for damages for personal injury to any workman, employee or servant of such company, nor shall any action or suit by such workman, employee or servant, or, in the event of his death, by his personal representatives, against the company, be barred or defeated by reason of any notice, condition or declaration made or issued by the company, or made or issued by any insurance or provident society or association of railway employees formed, or purporting to be formed, under such Act; or by reason of any rules or by-laws of the company, or rules or by-laws of the society or association; or by reason, of the privity of interest or relation established between the company and the society or association, or the contribution or payment of moneys of the company to the funds of the society or association; or by reason of any benefit, compensation or indemnity which the workman, employee or servant, or his personal representatives, may become entitled to or obtain from such society or association or by membership therein; or by reason of any express or implied acknowledgment, acquittance or release obtained by the company or the society or association prior to the happening of the wrong or injury complained of, or the damage accruing, to the purport or effect of relieving or releasing the company from liability for damages for personal injuries as aforesaid.\nThe following counsel appeared on the hearing.\nNewcombe K. C., Deputy Minister of Justice for the Dominion of Canada.\nC. H. Ritchie K. C. and Haughton Lennox for the Railway Employees.\nWalter Cassels K. C. for the Grand Trunk Railway Company.\nNewcombe K. C. is heard. This legislation only applies to railway companies within the jurisdiction or legislative control of Parliament and is authorized by sec. 91, subsec. 29 of The B. N. A. Act, 1867 and sec 92 subsec. 10.\nRailway companies of the class mentioned can only be incorporated by Parliament which can also take away the powers so conferred. Vogel v. Grand Trunk Railway Co[1].\nRitchie K. C. and Lennox are heard for the Railway Employees. The validity of legislation similar to this has been upheld by the courts in Ferguson v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[2]; Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Miller[3]; The Queen v. Grenier[4].\nParliament has the exclusive power to prescribe regulations for the construction, repair and alteration of the railway and for its management, and to dictate the powers and constitution of the company. Per Lord Watson in Canadian Pacific Railway Co, V. Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours[5].\nCassells K. C. is heard for the Grand Trunk Railway Co. This legislation is void as an infringement on property and civil rights in the Province. Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[6]; Russell v. The Queen[7]; Attorney General of Manitoba v. Manitoba License Holders Association[8].\nThe Ontario Courts have held The Workmens' Compensation Act applies to Dominion railways, consequently this legislation is within the competence of the local legislature. See Washington v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[9]; Canada Southern Railway Co, v. Jackson[10].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion, as at present advised, that the Act in question is intra vires of the Dominion Parliament. I view it as one of public order for the good government of the whole of the Dominion in relation to corporations and undertakings under the control of the federal authority. The case of Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons (5), relied upon by the railway companies does not, as I read it, help their opposition to the validity of the Act. I see nothing in it to justify their contention that if the Dominion Parliament had imposed statutory conditions for the whole Dominion upon the federal insurance companies, such statutory conditions would have been ultra vires. The exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament over federal railways must include the power to enlarge or restrict their rights and duties in the administration of their various roads so as to make them uniform all through the Dominion. It is certainly expedient, not to say more, that upon such railways the relations between the corporation and its employees should be governed by the same rules all over the Dominion, and that the right of an employee of such a company, or of his personal representative in the event of his death, to recover compensation if he is injured or killed in the performance of his duties be not different whether the accident happens in British Columbia for instance, or in Nova Scotia or Quebec, or made dependent upon the locality where he has joined the service of the company. And the federal Parliament alone can pass such a law for the Dominion. These federal corporations are created and these railways are operated in the public interest of the Dominion at large, and whatever the federal Parliament thinks it expedient to decree in relation to their management and administration in that same public interest it must have the power to do.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014If I were unfettered by authority I would feel inclined to declare that the statute before us was ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada. But in face of the decisions of the Privy Council I consider that doubt is not even possible, and that we have only one thing to do, that is. to uphold that statute as being incidental to the power which clauses 91 and 92 of the B. N. A. Act give to the Parliament of Canada, to make laws for the creation, regulation and maintenance of interprovincial or international, or even federal railways, within the meaning of the said Act.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I confess to having had many doubts upon the proper answer to be given to the question asked as to the validity of this legislation. It is very near the line, and. while, from one point of view, it seems to be intra vires of the Dominion Parliament I admit the weight of the arguments to the contrary. On the whole, 1 have reached the conclusion that the legislation is intra vires and valid, and my answer to the question is in the affirmative. If intra vires in part it seems to me be so in all.\nI have reached this conclusion because I think the Act is within the enumerated powers specially conferred upon the Dominion Parliament by the 91st section of the British North America Act.\nSub-section 29 of that section extends the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada to\nsuch classes of subjects as are expressly excepted in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\nThe subject matter here in question comes within the express exception of sub-section 10 of section 92, and therefore comes within the 29th enumeration of section 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, and is excluded from provincial powers by the tenth enumeration of section ninety-two.\nExclusive legislative authority on railways, such as are here enumerated, being vested in the Dominion Parliament, that Parliament has, as a consequence, full and paramount power so to legislate upon such matter as fully, properly and effectively to carry out the construction, management and operation of these railways. In so legislating it matters not that they infringe upon the powers of legislation with regard to property and civil rights assigned to the provincial legislatures. Such invasion is admittedly necessary to enable the parliament properly and effectively to legislate. The main and controlling question is, therefore, whether the legislation in question can be said to be fairly and reasonably within the plenary and exclusive powers of the Dominion Parliament enabling it effectively to control the construction, management and operation of the classes of railways excepted from sub-section ten of section ninety-two and embraced within sub-section twenty-nine of section ninety-one. I think it may fairly be so held.\nThe Act substantially prohibits any railway under the jurisdiction of Parliament from making any contract directly or indirectly with its employees so as to limit or relieve the company from liability for personal injuries to these employees in the course of their employment. The provisions necessarily infringe upon subject matters ordinarily within the jurisdiction of the legislatures. But that does not matter provided the legislation can be upheld as being reasonably within the exclusive powers conceded to the Dominion Parliament to provide for the effective and proper operation and management of the roads. I do not think the courts should be astute to discover reasons to annul the legislation of parliament on a subject. matter within its exclusive jurisdiction even if, in the exercise of its powers, it does trench upon the subjects generally within the provincial jurisdiction, or if plausible arguments can be urged that, from that one aspect, such legislation is not necessary to control effectively the subject matter of such legislation.\nThe Grand Trunk Railway Company in its factum upon this appeal contending against the validity of the Act, says: The statute in question is far reaching. It would operate to destroy the effect of any notice, condition or declaration made or issued by the company. Such a statute might prove very injurious to the proper maintenance and operation of the railway. It would tend to negligence on the part of employees; and other results of an injurious character to the public service and the safety of the travelling public would necessarily result from such a far-reaching statute.\nNow, these arguments rather tend to confirm my opinion of the validity of the legislation. Whether it\nwould prove injurious or not to the proper maintenance and operation of the railway\nis for Parliament and not the court to decide. By passing the Act Parliament has decided. That the Act may affect \"the proper maintenance and operation of the road\" seems, by the argument, to be admitted, and once that conclusion of fact is reached, the legal result follows, of parliamentary jurisdiction. Any Dominion legislation that, it may reasonably be assumed, will substantially affect the proper maintenance and operation of the railway must, in my opinion, be valid. The fact that it may, from a railway standpoint, be deemed prejudicial and injurious to railway interests and may not promote effective operation and management, by no means settles the question. In deciding such a point parliament must within all proper reasonable limits be supreme.\nHuman agencies are as essential for the proper management and operation of railways as are mechanical agencies, and, so far they relate to these objects, are necessarily subject to the control of Dominion legislation. The former are, of course, from their complex nature, necessarily, more difficuly to control and the line, up to which and within which the powers of the Dominion Parliament extend, is difficult to determine and almost impossible to define by any arbitrary rule. But it does seem to me that the hours during which employees may or may not work, the sex, ages and wages of those who may be employed, the right of employees to combine and form labour unions, the degree and extent to which these unions may be permitted to interfere with the hours, wages and work of the men, the negligence which will give employees a right of action caused by it, the limitations which ought to be put upon that right, alike as to the power of the employee to surrender or contract himself out of the right or the power of the railway company, by notice or rule or otherwise, to limit or entirely abolish it, are all subjects well within the Dominion legislative powers, although they may infringe upon the general powers of the local legislatures. These special matters I have mentioned are a few of the many analogous and cognate subjects arising out of the employment by these great railway corporations of many thousands of men whose duties are to control and manage railways forming a perfect net-work across the Dominion, which subjects must either wholly or partially come within the ambit of the Parliament alone capable of calling these corporations into being and of effectively regulating their operation.\nWe cannot ignore, in determining what are and what are not fairly within the ambit, the actual existing condition in Canada.\nHere are at least three great railway corporations, either already transcontinental or rapidly becoming so. Their operations are of a national character and importance. Their employees number many thousands. The unions of these employees amongst themselves for the better support and protection of their interests and the amalgamation, in some cases, of these unions with the labour unions of the neighbouring republic, add additional strength to the argument for giving a broad and liberal construction to the plenary powers of legislation vested in the Dominion Parliament so as to ensure some degree of uniformity in its exercise.\nIf legislation affecting the contracts entered into by the railways with their employees and the limitations which may be placed upon the companies' liability for damages to their workmen when injured or killed in the course of their employment, are matters for the several provincial legislatures and not for the Dominion Parliament, then, of course, such legislation may be as various and conflicting as there are legislatures to legislate, and it may well result that such various and conflicting legislation would materially affect the management and operation of the roads.\nI am, after much reflection, of the opinion that all such legislation must necessarily be within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada which creates the corporations and has plenary and exclusive powers to legislate upon everything relating to their effective management and control.\nIn the late case of Madden v. Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway Co:[11], the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that the provision in The British Columbia Cattle Protection Act, 1891, as amended in 1895, to the effect that a Dominion railway company, unless they erect proper fences on their railway, should be responsible for cattle injured or killed thereon, was ultra vires of the provincial legislature. The Lord Chancellor, in delivering the judgment said:\nIt would have been impossible to maintain the authority of the Dominion Parliament, if the provincial legislature were to be permitted to enter into such a field of legislation which is wholly withdrawn from them and is, therefore, manifestly ultra vires;\nand he goes on to explain the meaning of the Privy Council's judgment in the case of The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. The Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours[12] by saying that, in that case, it was decided that, although any direction of the provincial legislature to create new works on the railway and make a new drain and to alter its construction, would be beyond the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures, the railway company were not exempted from the municipal state of the law as it then existed\u2014that all landowners, including the railway company\u2014should clean out their ditches so as to prevent a nuisance.\nThese decisions throw much light upon the view which the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council take as to the necessity of excluding the provinces from interfering by legislation in a matter wholly withdrawn from them and, inferentially, show how broad should be the construction placed upon the powers of the Dominion in a matter exclusively relegated to it to legislate upon.\nFor these reasons, I answer the questions as to the validity of the Act in question in the affirmative.\nNESBITT J.\u2014That the Dominion Parliament has the exclusive jurisdiction to legislate in respect to the incorporation, organization, operation and management of certain railways is not open to dispute, and the sole question presented for our consideration here is whether the Act in question is not an infringement of the provincial jurisdiction as being legislation upon civil rights and not purporting to be upon a subject incident to or ancillary to \"railway legislation.\" It is to be observed that the Act is one claimed to be promoted by a section of the employees of the railway and aimed at the redress of a contract grievance or supposed destruction of civil remedy and as such it is frankly supported by the factum filed on behalf of the promoter acting for such employees.\nIt is also to be observed that although it is headed \"An Act to amend the Railway Act of 1903,\" it stands quite apart from the \"Act to amend the Railway Act, 1903,\" to be found in the very next chapter of the same statutes, and which latter Act deals with what might well be described as \"railway legislation.\" I merely draw attention to this as lending some colour to the argument that the Act in question was only passed to interfere with contract rights and has no real relation to the operation or management of \"railways.\" The Act itself, we were told on argument, was passed because the Dominion Parliament had incorporated an insurance company and compelled the Grand Trunk Railway Company to contribute a certain sum yearly to the funds of the company which company had been empowered to make by-laws and that one of the by-laws, No. 15, made provision that any member of the society or his representatives became disqualified from maintaining an action against the railway company for injuries arising from accident. This has been held to be a contract authorized by the employee who took advantage of the benefits of the company's contribution, etc., and to preclude recovery for negligence. The Act in question apparently goes much further than legislation upon such a subject as was said to be aimed at and, as I read it, provides that no railway company shall be relieved from liability for damages for personal injury to any workman, employee or servant of such company, by reason of any notice, condition or declaration made or issued by the company, or by reason of any rule or by-laws of the company, or by any express or implied acknowledgment, acquittance or release obtained by the company * * * prior to the happening of the wrong or injury complained of, or the damage accruing to the purport or effect of relieving or releasing the company from liability for damages for personal injuries as aforesaid.\nSuch legislation would, it seems to me. enable an employee to recover notwithstanding his express breach of duties prescribed although the provincial law regulating the rights of the parties was to the contrary and I am unable to conceive that such legislation can be said to be in any way incidental to the operation or management of railways or to be in any sense \"railway legislation.\" Since railways were operated no such provisions so far as I know can be found in any country under the guise of legislation regulating the operation or management of railways, and I cannot believe would be granted by any Parliament as part of a legislative railway policy.\nNecessarily at almost every step in railway legislation property and civil rights must be involved, such as expropriating lands, contracts for carriage of goods, regulating the tolls to be charged and the terms of carriage. Duties must be prescribed, but the remedies for breach of such duties it seems to me are within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures. No doubt if parliament saw fit to enact as part of the operating policy of the railway that workman should only work certain hours; that men of certain age only should be employed; that no women or young boys or girls should be so employed; that workmen should not go on strike; it could do so as an incident of railway operation but this legislation does not appear to me to fall within the doctrine of operation or management but rather within legislation as to contracts as, for instance, if Parliament prescribed that if a passenger was injured on the railway he should give notice within twelve hours or no action would lie, which would be, in my opinion, outside its jurisdiction. I think Parliament can say the railway shall do so and so and, upon failure, any person injured by such failure shall have an action, but there, it seems to me, its jurisdiction ends, and the doctrine of civil rights leaves the railway subject to the jurisdiction of the Provincial Legislatures as to the remedies and defences respectively. Mr. Lennox, the promoter, argued that the legislation was necessary because the insurance society was incorporated by the Parliament of Canada, but it seems to me that a foreign corporation of which the employees became members or policy holders under similar recited conditions would have been the same The remedy given otherwise by law the employee was held to have contracted himself out of, not because it was a Dominion corporation, but for the reasons I have indicated, and the legislation in question, therefore, is admittedly to get rid of the effect of what has been held to be a contract, and is not to prescribe certain rules to govern in the employment of operatives in the management of the railway viewed in which aspect it might well be \"railway legislation,\" and intra vires. In Ontario the 10th sect, of R.S.O., 1897, ch. 160, would seem to regulate the defence. In Quebec in case of death, art. 1056 of the Civil Code would indicate that the workman could receive compensation for the injury prior to his death and so allow him to contract for a release for any injury from which death might result, which would bar action by his representative. This statute if intra vires would appear to override any provincial law. I am not deciding that rule 15 of the Grand Trunk Provident Association is a binding contract, but this legislation, as 1 read it, embraces any acquittance obtained by the company prior to the accident and, therefore, seems to me a matter purely affecting civil rights and not legislation falling within the subject of \"railways\" as relating to the incorporation, organization, operation or management of them. I have been constrained to this view by what I conceive to be the real purport of The Queen Insurance Co. v. Parsons[13]; Hodge v. The Queen[14]; Russell v. The Queen[15]; McArthur v. Northern & Pacific Junction Railway Co.[16]; Clegg v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[17]; Canada Southern Railway Co. v. Jackson[18]; The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours[19]; Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden[20]; Cunningham v. Tomey Homma[21]; City of Toronto v. Bell Telephone[22]. Also, the recent ten hour labour case from New York, decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, where the majority held that the law was really a labour law and unconstitutional and not a health law and constitutional as a police provision.\nThe statute under consideration seems plainly one seeking to disguise purely civil rights' legislation under the false garb of railway policy and deprives one party to a contract of its rights under the form of legislating on the subject of \"railways\" when such contract rights are neither incidental nor ancillary to such subject, unless the mere fact of one of the contracting parties being a railway necessarily creates jurisdiction.\nI would adopt the well known rule in the United States where the courts have been so often called upon to decide between the nicely shaded lines of state and federal authority and where the character of legislation is none the less manifest because of the general terms in which it is expressed.\nI would answer that the Act in question was not one the Parliament of Canada was competent to pass.\n[1] 10 Ont.

The Territorial Court en banc reversed the trial judge in his findings of fact upon the evidence.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, that the trial judge's findings should be sustained with a slight variation, but that the referee had erred in adopting the severer rule against the defendants in assessing the damages, and that his report should be amended in view of such error.\nSemble, that the record and pleadings should be amended by adding the plaintiff's partner as co-plaintiff.\nHeld, per Taschereau C.J. dissenting, that although not convinced that there was error in the judgment of the trial judge which the court en banc reversed, while at the same time it did not appear that there was error in the judgment en banc, yet the latter judgment should stand., as the court en banc should not be reversed unless the Supreme Court, on the appeal, be clearly satisfied that it was wrong.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Territorial Court of Yukon Territory reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Craig, at the trial, and dismissing the plaintiffs' action with costs. The plaintiffs sued to recover damages sustained through trespasses committed by the defendants on fractional creek placer mining claim No. 20A, below discovery, on Hunker creek in the Yukon Territory, of which the plaintiffs were grantees from the Crown at the time the action was brought. The trespasses complained of consisted of the removal of the pay-dirt and gold-bearing gravel from a portion of the claim, covering an area of 964 square feet, and the washing up by the defendants and converting to their own use of the gold therein. The action was tried in June, 1903, before Mr. Justice Craig, who found that the defendants committed the trespasses complained of, and that they did so wilfully and deliberately, or at all events, that such gross carelessness was shown by them in the operations from which these trespasses resulted that they must be accounted wilful trespassers. At the trial it was agreed between counsel, with the approval of the court, that the issue being tried should not bear upon the quantum of damages, but that that should be referred to a referee later. Pursuant to this arrangement the judgment directed a reference to the clerk of the Territorial Court to take an account of the plaintiffs' damages in accordance with the declarations as to the rights and liabilities of the parties set out therein. The referee made his report fixing the plaintiffs' damages at $14,993, for which amount and costs judgment was entered. From this judgment and report the defendants appealed, and the Territorial Court in banco, Craig J. dissenting, reversed the judgment at the trial and dismissed the action. The plaintiffs now appeal.\nAylesworth K.C. and Walsh K.C. for the appellants.\nAuguste No\u00ebl for the respondent. The Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. Not that I am convinced that there was error in the judgment of the trial judge, which the court in banco reversed, but because I am not convinced that there is error in the judgment in banco appealed from.\nThe appellant, I am free to confess, has succeeded in creating considerable doubt in my mind as to its correctness, but I cannot reverse upon a doubt. That judgment must stand if the appellant has not convinced us that it is wrong, and that, as far as I am concerned, he has failed to do. It may be that, had I formed part of the court in banco, I would have affirmed the judgment of the trial judge, because, though doubting, I would not have been clearly satisfied that he was wrong, but it is the judgment of the court in banco that the appellant asks us to reverse, and we cannot reverse it, though doubting, if not clearly satisfied that it is wrong.\nIn Hale v. Kennedy ([1]), it was held in that sense, that:\nThe rule generally followed by the courts is not to review the finding of the judge of first instance where his decision depends upon a balance of testimony; still, if the court in banco has reversed that finding, this court must be satisfied upon appeal that the court in banco was wrong, before it will interfere with that judgment.\nWe are concerned directly, (said Lord O'Hagan, in Symmington v. Symmington ([2]) an analogous case,) not with the judgment of the Lord Ordinary, (the trial judge,) but with that which overruled it; and the latter, we ought to affirm unless we are satisfied of its error,\u2014\nfollowed in this court in Demers v. The Montreal Slearn Laundry Company ([3]).\nGirouard J.\u2014I would allow this appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge in to, but, as the majority of the court has come to the conclusion to send the case back to re-assess the damages, I will not dissent.\nDAVIES J. concurred with Idington J.\nNESBITT J. concurred with Idington J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Craig restored upon amendment to be allowed.\nA careful consideration of the judgments of Mr. Justice Dugas and of Mr. Justice Macaulay and the evidence they respectively lay stress upon, and the rest of the evidence supporting defendants' view of the case, leaves no doubt in my mind but that the learned trial judge is right in finding that the defendants had trespassed.\nMuch of the confusion that exists, arises from attaching too much importance to some answers of the witness Hovland, which if taken as literally and mathematically correct, may furnish an apparently good foundation for what the majority of the court below have built thereon. Such an interpretation of the witness's evidence is not warranted by it as a whole. He did not, though placing his finger at point \"E\" in Exhibit H, intend to convey the meaning that there was at that point, as distinct from shaft No 3 on same plan, another shaft with timber in it, and lagging leading from it towards or across the line dividing 21 from fraction 20a. If he had been for a moment so understood by court and counsel, we would have had much more relating to this point E than we have been favoured with. The witness, quite honestly, put himself, by his speaking of the centre of the cut and distances he gave from that point, at another place than he would be, consistently with holding him as referring to shaft No. 3 in much of his evidence. It is to my mind just one of those obvious errors that occur daily at the trial of cases where a witness, however much he tries, may not be able to be absolutely correct in regard to either time or space, and especially when dealing with maps or plans which many intelligent men often cannot com-prehend.\nThe witnesses have been so numerous and the holes they refer to have been in their stories multiplied so many times beyond what appear on the plans before us, as to render the case somewhat troublesome. The learned trial judge, and counsel, I have no doubt, understood what each witness referred to, and when the witness happens to speak of \"this\" and \"that,'' \"here\" and \"there,\" without specifically identifying on the plan the point referred to, he was not confusing anybody at the trial. This furnishes to my mind (in addition to the usual reasons for so doing) abundant reason for here accepting the judgment of the learned trial judge rather than that in appeal. I think it is not at all a case where there is any need for assuming wholesale perjury to have existed in any view one might take of the case.\nBut there is needed in the trial judge of a case like this that keen discrimination that weighs the evidence by tests that separate, as the trial proceeds, the results of the accurate from the inaccurate witness, the candid, truthful one from the one less so. I am, therefore, slow to suggest that the learned trial judge may have erred in his finding wilful carelessness.\nIt is, however, by assuming that in the main the witnesses tried to give us the truth that we are here enabled so to reconcile nearly all the evidence, with the result arrived at. In doing so we have to assume defendant and his witnesses, with one or two excep- tions, honest, and if honest there cannot be that wilful carelessness imputed to the defendants that the law requires before assessing damages on the scale which has been adopted. I think the milder rule suggested in Trotter v. Maclean ([4]) should be adopted and the defendant should be allowed in any event the full cost of getting out the gold in addition to the mere cost of washing after the earth was dug out. I think, too, the referee has been influenced by the severer rule having been adopted, into treating this piece of ground as exceptionally rich as compared with all the surrounding ground, apparently thinking the defendant should be punished with a very high average.\nI offer no opinion as to the proper result other than to say I am of opinion the result arrived at is unreasonable and excessive, and is not supported by the evidence.\nIt is not clear that in law the respondents who raised by their statement of defence the issue of title are precluded by their failure to press it at the trial from now taking the objection they have done as to Bonner not being a party. At all events the defendants are entitled to have the doubt removed and Bonner, in whose name (with that of his partner) as one of the partners the license stood when some of the trespasses were committed, bound by the recovery herein. I think, therefore, he should be added as, a party plaintiff. He seems to have assigned his rights to his partner Kirkpatrick. That assignment may not so have transferred his right of action as to vest it in Kirkpatrick. But evidently he intended to sell all his interests to the remaining partner, and that sale carried with it the right to use his name. The case has been tried as if the defendants were liable therein for any of the trespasses that the licensees or any of them might have a right to complain of, and to give effect to this result let the suggested amendment be made; to carry out this let the court below amend the record and the referee then re-assess the damages on basis indicated.\nSee Harper v. Godsell ([5]) at p. 428; Dawson v. Great Northern and City Railway Co. ([6]); May v. Lane ([7]); Colonial Bank v. Whinney ([8]); Job v. Potton ([9]); Caldwell v. Stadacona Fire & Life Insurance Co. ([10]).\nThe appeal then should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: C. W. C. Tabor.\nSolicitors for the respondent: No\u00ebl & No\u00ebl.\n[1] 8 Ont.

The conductor was informed of the first assault immediately after it occurred and also of the second but took no steps to protect B. In an action against the railway company B. recovered damages assessed generally for the injuries complained of. The verdict was maintained by the Court of Appeal but the Superior Court of Canada ordered a new trial unless B. would consent to his damages being reduced (34 Can. S.C.R. 74). In the reasons given for the last-mentioned judgment written by Mr. Justice Sedgewick for the court, it was held that damage could be recovered for the third assault only but the judgment as entered by the registrar stated that the court ordered the reversal of the judgment appealed from and a new trial unless the plaintiff accepted the reduced amount of damages. Such amount having been refused a new trial was had on which B. again obtained a verdict the damages being apportioned between the second and third assaults. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of the Court of Appeal maintaining this verdict:\nHeld, Taschereau C.J. and Davies J. dissenting, that as the decree was in accordance with the judgment pronounced by the court when its decision was given, and as it left the whole case open on the second trial the jury were free to give damages for the second assault and their verdict should not be disturbed.\nHeld, per Taschereau C.J. that the decree of the court should have been framed with reference to the opinion giving the reasons for the judgment and, if necessary, could be amended so as to be read as the court intended.\nAPPEAL from a decision of a Court of Appeal for Ontario maintaining a verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff. The facts material to this appeal are fully stated in the above head-note.\nJohnson K.C. and Denison for the appellant.\nRiddell K.C. and D.O. Cameron for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am not quite convinced that, under the state of facts brought out at the trial, this respondent has any right of action whatever against the appellants upon any of the allegations of his statement of claim. That is why, though I did not enter a dissent, I had, upon the first appeal[1] to ask my brother Sedgewick to write down the reasons for our judgment, not feeling satisfied that I could myself find any good ones in support of the conclusion of the court that the appellants were liable for the third assault complained of by the respondent, though not for the two others. However, that judgment is, of course, binding upon me. It is the settled law of the case.\nAs to the $2,500 for the second assault, the only point now before us, I would allow the appeal. The respondent was not entitled to a second trial as to this assault. The order or rule for a new trial drawn up in the office must be construed with reference to the opinion of the court upon which it is based, and, consequently, has to be read with the words\nas to the third assault complained of by the respondent in his statement of claim,\nafter the words \u201cparties.\u201d This judicial opinion was the only effective authority for the drawing up of that rule or order. See per Esher M.R., in Hollby v. Hodgson. It does not, strictly speaking, form part of the record, but it cannot, as the respondent would contend, be entirely disregarded in the construction of the formal order. On the contrary, as laid down by the annotator to the word \u201cMandate.\u201d vol. 13, Ency. of Pl. & Pr. 847:\nThe lower court, in giving effect to the mandate of the appellate court, should construe such mandate with reference to the opinion accompanying it.\nWhere a cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings, they must be had in accordance with the opinion or the direction of the appellate court.\nId. vol. 2, 378. See Davidson v. Dallas[2].\nIn Pitts v. La Fontaine[3], in the Privy Council, their Lordships, upon the construction of a previous order-in-council, referred to a passage in their judgment to demonstrate what had been their intention in making that order.\nThe opinion, delivered by this court at the time of rendering its decree,\nsaid Mr. Justice Gray, for the court, In re Sanford Fork and Tool Co.[4]\nmay be consulted to ascertain what was intended by its mandate and * * * upon a new appeal it is for this court to construe its own mandate and to act accordingly.\nSee also West v. Brashear[5]; Supervisors v. Kennicott[6]; Graff v. Boesch[7]; and Smith v. Day[8].\nIn Thompson v. Maxwell Land Grant and Rway. Co.[9], Mr. Justice Brewer, delivering the opinion of the court, said, in the same sense:\nWe take judicial notice of our own opinions, and although the judgment and the mandate express the decision of the court, yet we may properly examine the opinion in order to determine what matters were considered, upon what grounds the judgment was entered, and what has become settled for further disposition of the case. We therefore turn to the former opinion and the mandate to see what was presented and decided.\nThe reasons for the judgment do not constitute the judgment, but the formal judgment is void if inconsistent with the opinion of the court and in direct opposition to it. And upon that ground would the court have said to this respondent upon appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial,\nyou cannot recover upon the evidence for the first and second assaults, but we will give you another chance to prove that part of your case.\nThe order of this court now in question limits to $1,000 the amount that the respondent, in our opinion, was entitled to, not because we held that he was entitled to that amount for the three assaults complained of in his statement of claim, but because he was not, in our opinion, entitled to recover for the two first assaults; and as the jury had rendered a general verdict in his favour for a lump sum of $3,500, for which judgment had been entered against the appellants, and as we were of opinion that this sum upon the evidence was grossly in excess of the damages resulting to him from the third assault, the only one for which the appellants were liable, their appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered unless he, the respondent, agreed to take $1,000 for the damages he had suffered from that third assault. Had we been of opinion that the appellants were liable for the three assaults, their appeal would have been dismissed. And had we been of opinion that they were not liable at all for any of the three assaults, it is clearly not a new trial that we would have ordered; judgment would then have been entered in their favour and the respondent\u2019s action dismissed. And had the respondent accepted the $1,000, the judgment entered for that amount would clearly not have been a judgment for the damages resulting to him from the two first assaults[10].\nIf necessary, in view of the circumstances of this case, the order should be amended nunc pro tunc, in furtherance of justice, so as to read as the court intended it to be. Every court has an inherent jurisdiction to put its records in correct form, on application, or ex mero mot\u00fb, in default of application. No court will allow an order to stand which does not speak the truth. Re Swire[11], approved of in House of Lords, in Hatton v. Harris[12]. And for ascertaining what it was that the court really ordered or determined, can there be a safer and more reliable guide than the written opinion of the court filed as its judgment? And the parties are not at liberty either by consent express or implied, nor by waiver or acquiescence to bind a court to accept as its judgment anything else but that which the court intended to be its judgment.\nNorth J. in Shipwright v. Clements[13], allowed an amendment of a decree 20 years old so as to make it comfortable to the written opinion of the judge who had pronounced it. In Hatton v. Harris12, in the House of Lords, a decree forty years old was amended,\nLord Penzance, in Lawrie v. Lees[14] said.\nI cannot doubt that under the original powers of the Court, quite independent of any order that is made under the Judicature Act, every court has the power to vary its own orders which are drawn up mechanically in the registry or the office of the court,\u2014to vary them in such a way as to carry out its own meaning, and where language has been used which is doubtful to make it plain.\nSee Smith v. Goldie[15] and Rattray v. Young15, in this court.\nIn Rajunder Narain Rae v. Bijai Govind Sing[16] their Lordships of the Privy Council held that\nBy the common law this court possesses the same powers as the courts of record and statute have, of rectifying mistakes which have crept in by misprision or otherwise, in embodying its judgments.\nIn Insurance Company v. Boon[17] in the United States Supreme Court, it was said by Strong J.:\u2014 Every court of record has power to amend its records so as to make them conform to and exhibit the truth. Ordinarily, there must be something to amend by, but that may be the judge\u2019s minutes or notes, not themselves records, or anything that satisfactorily shows what the truth was;\nand the learned judge goes on to say that though the opinion of the judge is no part of the record, yet it is a guide for amending the formal judgment.\nHowever, in this case, I would not think an amendment necessary. The order should be construed as if it, in express terms, restricted the new trial to the third assault. If the trial judge had so construed it and, reading it by the light of the opinion delivered by this court, had charged the jury accordingly, the respondent would not have asked us, I am sure, to hold that the judge had erred in acting in conformity to the unanimous opinion of this court and to send the case back for a new trial because he had not directed a erdict for all the assaults.\nSEDGEWICK\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The whole difficulty arises out of what appears to have been an oversight in the judgment of this court delivered in this very case. The court did not seem to have anticipated that the respondent might refuse the $1,000 allowed him in full satisfaction of his claim and take the chances of a new trial.\nThe respondent, while travelling as a passenger on a train of the appellants, was thrice seriously assaulted by a drunken fellow passenger, first, at the Toronto Union Station, before the departure of the train, and twice after, and claimed damages, in consequence, from the railway company. The case was tried by a judge and jury who rendered a general verdict for $3,500. This verdict being sustained by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal, an appeal was taken to this court, which, on the 30th November, 1903, pronounced the following judgment, as per written memorandum read in open court, and then and there handed down to the Registrar, which was recorded in the minute book of the court, as follows:\nAppeal allowed, no costs in this court nor in the Court of Appeal. New trial ordered unless respondent accepts a reduction of damages to $1,000, interest and costs of court of first instance, the latter costs to be costs in cause to abide the event if respondent takes a new trial.\nAbout a couple of weeks afterward, namely, on the 17th day of December, 1903, the reasons for the said judgment were handed down to the said Registrar, who is empowered by statute to publish the reports of the \u201cdecisions\u201d of the Supreme Court (sec. 112 of the Supreme Court Act). In the course of time, frequently several months after their delivery, in this instance on the 30th of March, 1904, they were published in the Supreme Court Reports[18].\nIt appears from the report of the case that, as the court had come to the conclusion, on the evidence adduced at the trial, that the company was liable only for injury caused by the third assault, a new trial was ordered\nunless the plaintiff agrees to accept $1,000, together with costs, in full of his claim against the company. There will be no costs in the court below nor in this court.\nIt must be noted that the reasons for judgment, like the judgment, do not provide for the case of refusal by the plaintiff of this reduced amount of damages, by limiting the new trial to the third assault or by dismissing the action for any injury caused by the second assault. A new trial was ordered generally.\nLater on, on the 5th of January, 1904, the respondent, having declined the option, applied to the Regis- trar for a settlement of the minutes of the judgment, and, after hearing him and due service of said application having been accepted by the solicitor of the company who was also present, and no objections being made, the said Registrar settled and entered the minutes of judgment as follows:\n1. This court did order and adjudge that the said appeal should be and the same was allowed, and that the said judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and of the Chief Justice of the King\u2019s Bench should be and the same were reversed and set aside, and a new trial had between the parties, unless the respondent should accept a reduction of damages to $1,000, interest and costs of court of first instance, which option the respondent did, on the 31st day of December, 1903, refuse.\n2. And this court did further order and adjudge that the costs in the High Court of Justice for Ontario, in the event of such refusal, should be costs to the successful party in the cause.\n3. And this court did not see fit to make any order as to the costs in this court.\nI cannot conceive that this formal judgment, transmitted to the court below, is at variance with the written memorandum read in open court as the judgment of the court. I cannot even say that it contradicts the very terms of the reasons. But suppose it is inconsistent with their tenor and meaning, which document is to govern and constitute the judgment of this court? Is it the judgment pronounced in court, which alone should be transmitted and certified to the court appealed from, or the reasons for judgment which were not read in court nor transmitted to the court below? Can it be said that the reasons for judgment contain the \u201cjudgment or order\u201d of the court within the meaning of the Supreme Court Act? As I understand that Act, R.S.C. ch. 135, especially sec. 2 (d), and sections 19 and 67, the pronouncement in court, oral or written, of the decision of the court in any case constitutes the judgment of the court. The reasons of judgment are mere opinions which may be considered as part of the judgment in so far as they disclose the grounds upon which it is rendered, but they cannot vary the text or dispositif of the formal judgment.\nThe judges of the lower courts are not bound by any expressions used by the appellate court beyond and contrary to the decree. Such is also the well established jurisprudence not only in England but in the United States, and I submit, with due respect, that no other rule can reasonably and safely be adopted. I hardly believe that it is necessary to quote authorities upon this point; I will merely refer to the following where all the cases are collected; Encyl. of Pleading and Practice, vol. xi., pp. 825-826; Seton on Decrees, (6 ed.) 187; Daniels Chan. Prac vol. i., p. 636. The new trial had to take place as ordered by this court. It was held, accordingly, and the jury found negligence as to both second and third assaults\u2014a finding not shewn at the first trial, the verdict being a general one\u2014and returned a verdict for $1,500 by reason of the third assault, and $2,500 for the second one, which has been sustained by the trial judge Anglin J., and the Divisional Court, Chancellor Boyd, Teetzel and Magee JJ. We are now asked to set it aside as to the second assault, the appellant relying upon our reasons for judgment on the first appeal. I cannot examine the evidence in the latter case, the same not being before us, and applying the principles of law laid down in our said reasons of judgment and reading the evidence as I do in the present case, I have come to the conclusion not to disturb the verdict.\nIt is contended that the evidence is the same at the two trials. I do not know that, and I have no means of knowing. I see no admission of the parties to that effect. I notice also an order of the master permitting the use of any deposition of any witness given at the first trial only in the event of the plaintiff being unable to obtain the evidence of such witness. I find in the present printed case only one deposition taken at the first trial, that of Dr. McCallum. True, the evidence given at the former trial is on file among the archives of our court; but, as I understand my duty, I am functus officio and incompetent to take it into consideration I must decide this appeal like any other one, just as the Privy Council would do if ever called to review our decision, upon the record before us.\nThe appellants have only themselves to blame if they are deprived of the benefit of the former judgment of this court. They raised no objection to the judgment as pronounced, nor to the settlement of the minutes, although they were duly notified and appeared before the Registrar. They did not move to have them corrected or completed by this court or a judge thereof, either before they were transmitted to the court below or after, in the manner and form indicated in several cases collected in the digest of the reports of this court[19] in The Chambly Manufacturing Co. v. Willett[20] and Letourneau v. Carbonneau[21], both decided in this court in 1904, and also in Annual Practice[22].\nOn the first of February, 1904, the appellants moved in the court of first instance for a stay of proceedings upon the ground that they had applied for leave to appeal from the decision of this court to the Privy Council, which leave was later on refused[23]. They must be presumed to have known then the tenor of the judgment, and yet they did nothing to have the former properly rectified. They seemed to have relied entirely upon the principle of law involved in the case.\nAnd, when the second trial was held, no objection to the charge of the judge as to the second assault was raised; probably, in face of our judgment, none could be made; not even a suggestion was thrown out that this branch of the case had been disposed of by the judgment of this court. The appellants evidently understood that the whole case was re-opened and relied upon a fresh verdict as to both assaults, it being conceded by the plaintiff that the company was not liable for the first one. It is now too late to allow them to take a different view of the situation.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This is the second time that this case has been before us on appeal. On the first appeal[24] this court laid down the rule as to a carrier\u2019s liability, as follows:\nWhenever a carrier through its agents or servants knows or has the opportunity to know of the threatened injury, or might reasonably have anticipated the happening of an injury, and fails or neglects to take the proper precautions or to use the proper means to prevent or mitigate such injury, the carrier is liable.\nApplying that rule to the facts as proved we held that the carrier company was liable for damages for the third assault (so called), and was not liable for what was called the second assault. We, therefore, ordered a new trial, and, in such trial, the judge very properly directed the jury to find separately the damages for each of the assaults, which was done. No question was raised here as to damages for the last assault, the appellant finding itself precluded on the question of liability as to that by our previous decision, and not raising any question as to their amount. The question, and the only question raised, is as to the defendant\u2019s liability for what has been called the second assault, but which, as the trial judge justly remarked, might more properly, as against the defendants, be called the first assault.\nI have very carefully read all the evidence given at this second trial, but am quite unable to see any difference on the only point now before us between that evidence and the facts we had before us on the first appeal. We then held that the facts were not such as would justify a conclusion that the conductor ought reasonably to have anticipated this assault and taken measures to prevent it. So far as the facts are concerned the evidence as to what occurred at the Union Station and the Parkdale Station were admittedly the same at both trials. Mr. Riddell contends that on this trial the evidence of the conductor was not given and that Mr. Blain\u2019s evidence is fuller and more complete as to the facts at the moment the second assault took place. I am not able to see that these two contentions in any way should alter the result. So far as the assault which was made on the plaintiff at the Union Station, and before the train started, is concerned, it is common ground that the defendants are not liable. The conductor had no knowledge whatever of this assault except what he heard from Blain himself just as the train was leaving. In fact the train had actually started, but was stopped by some one to enable Blain, who, after the assault, had left the train, as, he says, to get a constable, to get aboard again. Then, for the first time, both men standing on the platform, the conductor hears from Blain that he had been assaulted by some one, but whether Anthony\u2019s name was mentioned or not Blain could not say. He told the conductor he would not go on the train unless the man was put off, and says the conductor replied there was no time then, but that he would get a constable at Parkdale, a station a couple of miles away. Just after this promise was given, the plaintiff Blain swears, that Mr. Thornton, the ticket agent at Brampton, from whom he had purchased his return ticket, came along the platform where he and the conductor were standing and called out, \u201cits all right, Mr. Blain, get on, and, I still hesitated, he added, he (meaning Anthony) is quiet now, and, I thought he was quiet now till we got to Parkdale.\u201d\nThe only information the conductor had was that there had been an assault but that the man who committed it was all right and then quiet. Before hearing this he had given the promise about the constable.\nAt Parkdale, Mr. Blain spoke to the conductor on the platform about the constable and was told there was none there and to get on. But he does not say a single word intimating that the man had not remained quiet or that anything had occured since assurances had been given to Blain and the conductor that Anthony was quiet to make the conductor fear or anticipate any renewal of trouble.\nIn all the evidence before us I have not been able to find a single word or fact indicating that from the moment on the Toronto platform, when the assurances were given about it being all right to get on, that the man was quiet, up to the moment when the second assault took place, the man Anthony had not remained perfectly quiet or that the conductor could or ought to have had any knowledge to the contrary. In the absence of any such evidence, how can it be held that the conductor could or should have anticipated a renewal of the troubles? He knew nothing of the previous relations between the parties. He was in charge of an excursion train filled with passengers, and learns, at the moment of starting, that there had been an assault committed, whereupon, he tells the complaining party to get on the train and he would have a constable at the next station. This is followed by assurances from friends of the parties that the man had become quiet and that it was all right. No subsequent information was given to the conductor of any change in the man\u2019s attitude, nor did any facts occur from which he could or ought to have inferred any such change till after the second assault took place. No evidence whatever was given that any change did as a fact take place till the actual commission of the second assault. The conductor, therefore, had been lulled into a false security and could not reasonably have anticipated this assault. Mr. Blain, himself, did not anticipate it. The assault was sudden, so much so that the friends of Mr. Blain, who were sitting around him at the time, could not interfere in time to prevent it,\nUnder these facts I feel that unless we reverse our previous decision we are obliged to set aside the finding of damages for the so-called second assault and to reduce the verdict to the sum of $1,500, the damages awarded for the third assault.\nThe appeal should be allowed accordingly.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Plaintiff having entered as a passenger one of the defendants\u2019 passenger cars forming a train which was to leave Union Station, Toronto, for Brampton 11 p.m. on 10th October, 1901, was in passing along the aisle assaulted, knocked down between two seats and pounded there by one Anthony, till fellow passengers took him off.\nAnthony was wild, boisterous, in a very noisy condition and quarrelsome. He was drunk. He had immediately previous to this assault upon plaintiff seized another passenger on the same train, shoved him back on a seat threatening that he would choke him to death. He was a big, strong, powerful man, weighing about two hundred and fifty pounds.\nThe train was a large one. The plaintiff with his wife, got off the car, and he went for a constable, whilst she stood on the platform. Meantime Anthony was scuffling with others on the car striking at them. People were standing up and quite a row and noise were going on in the car.\nThis was five minutes before the train was due to leave. No conductor or brakesman was about. After traversing the tracks going upstairs and inquiring in vain for a constable, plaintiff returned to the train which was starting.\nPlaintiff says:\nAnd some one called out, here is Mr. Blain; he is coming; and the car stopped, and the conductor then for the first time came to me, and he says: What did you stop the train for?\nQ. Is that the tone he said it in?\nA. A good deal more surly than that. I said, I did not stop the train. He said why don\u2019t you get on. I said I have been assaulted by a man in there\u2014I think I mentioned the name Anthony, but I am not sure\u2014he has assaulted two or three other parties, and he threatens to do it again, and I am not going on the train unless he is removed or arrested. He says, well, the man has a ticket, and he has a right to go. Well, I said, he has no right to go on and commit a breach of the peace, and I won\u2019t go on. He said, you get on; and I positively refused. I had abandoned the idea of going. Well, he said, there is no constable here, and if you get on we will have a constable at Parkdale. I hesitated; and just at that moment Mr. Thorburn, the ticket agent at Brampton, who had sold me the ticket, called out, he is all right, Mr. Blain, you get on.\nQ. You told him you had been assaulted by some person, and that you had been told he had assaulted two or three others, had you?\nA. Yes.\nQ. What others?\nA. I saw him striking at Beattie, and I saw him striking at Jim Noble before he made the assault on me.\nQ. And then you also said he threatened to do it again?\nA. Yes. As I was coming down the stairs somebody said, you get a constable, Mr. Blain; he is threatening to go after you again.\nQ. You do not know of your own knowledge about a threat?\nA. No.\nQ. But did you tell the conductor that? A. Yes.\nQ. Then did you get on when he said he would get a constable at Parkdale?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Would you have got on without that promise?\nA. I certainly would not. I had abandoned the idea. I had no hat; my hat had been knocked off, and I was running through the station without a hat.\nQ. Did not you see any of the officers at all around the Union Station when you were running around that way without your hat looking for assistance?\nA. I did not; I tried earnestly to get a constable.\nQ. Then did you get on?\nA. I got on.\nQ. Did you see Anthony at all between Toronto Union Station and Parkdale?\nA. I did not.\nQ. Then at Parkdale what did you do?\nA. I got off at Parkdale, and did not see the conductor or Anthony. The car that I got off was not quite up to the station. I walked up the platform past a car, and in the next car, one next to the one I passed, was Anthony standing with a crowd around him, and I could hear him; he was talking in a loud voice.\nQ. Was he in the car?\nA. He was in the car; and, of course, I was surprised he was there. I looked around for the conductor, and I went into the station house and the conductor was there; he was getting his orders. Mr. Burnett from Brampton was there. After he got his orders I said to him, have not you got a constable? Are you not going to remove this man? He said, there is no constable here. Well, I said, it is only a matter of a few minutes to get a constable, and that man will cause trouble all the way to Brampton, and he has been threatening me again. He said: There is no one making a row but yourself. Well, I said, I had a right to make a row. I continued addressing him as I was walking on towards the train. He would hardly listen or stop, and when he got to the train he waved his lantern and says, you get on or you will be left. So I had not time to get back to the car I got off; I got on the car ahead of the one I got off.\nQ. Where was your wife?\nA. She was in the car behind the one I got on. I hesitated a moment, but my wife was in the car, and I could not possibly communicate with her, and I got on.\nQ. Then there was no way by which you could have communicated with her if you had stayed off at Parkdale?\nA. No.\nQ. Where was your hat at that time?\nA. I had no hat. Q. Then you got on at Parkdale?\nA. I got on at Parkdale.\n* * *\nQ. Then did you see the conductor before the next assault?\nA. No. The conductor got on the car in front of the one I got on.\nQ. Then from Union Station up to Parkdale, did the conductor pass through the train?\nA. No.\nQ. Parkdale, that is the first station after you leave the Union Station?\nA. Yes.\nQ, Did he pass through your car, at all events, from the time that you left the Union Station until such time as you were assaulted for the second time?\nA. No.\nWithin three miles from this point where plaintiff so imploringly made an appeal for protection, he was again assaulted by this drunken man in such a violent manner that for the damages arising therefrom the jury has awarded $2,500 damages, and the defendants say nothing as to the amount of the damages.\nThe conductor came along just after this second assault, and plaintiff relates thus what passed and was said, p. 21:\nNow this man has attacked me again. Well, he said, I did not see it. Well, I said, surely I am not to be killed before you believe me. There are plenty of people who saw him and know what is going on, and you ought to have him removed. Well, he said, he has a ticket, and he has a right to go on; and he did not give any satisfaction in any way.\nQ. Would he interfere to prevent him striking another assault or is that all he said?\nA. That is all he said.\nBefore reaching next station two miles further on, that is less than five miles from where the protection was asked and refused, a third assault took place, and plaintiff finally quit the train.\nFrom Union Station the man Anthony is described to have been \u201cmad drunk\u201d all the time and the condition of things in the car is described thus, p. 32:\nThe ladies could hear what was going on in the smoking compartment\u2014a fearful noise, and everybody was crowding around to see the man. He was perfectly wild, and people came. He was mad drank all the time. Q. Were the people in the car quiet all the way going up from Toronto, too?\nA. They were in a great state of excitement; the car in which the first assault took place the women folks all left that car and went into another car.\nQ. And what about the other cars: were they quiet?\nA. They were in an uproar all the way along.\nQ. Then at any time was that uproar put an end to? Was it quieted down at any time from the time you were assaulted at the Union Station until you got off?\nA. Never.\nBurnett, another passenger, who was also assaulted complained to the conductor and told him also of the assault on the plaintiff, and is asked:\nQ. Then what did he say to that?\nA. Well, he did not see the row or anything to that effect at all. He did not seem to be around to see this row.\nQ. No, I do not want the words; I want the substance of it?\nA. He said there was no one around here to arrest him; there was no policeman around.\nAgain, others desired arrest\nQ. What did he say when they wanted him arrested?\nA. Well, he said he did not see any row at all.\nQ. Well, then, when Mr. Blain spoke to the conductor about having been assaulted upon the train what did the conductor say to him then?\nA. The conductor said there did not seem to be any police around or any one around here to arrest this Anthony.\nWitness repeats variations of this view conductor took of the incident.\nThe condition of Anthony, the excitement in the car and the expectation that Anthony would be arrested at Parkdale, and the attitude of the conductor as testified to by each and all are corroborated by Beattie, and as to the excitement in the car and Anthony\u2019s condition, by Gilkinson and Broddie, Mr. Clendenning and Mrs. Clendenning, and Graham.\nThe last named also adds, p. 69:\nThe conductor said he had a ticket and he had as good a right to ride as Mr. Blain. Mr. Blain said he would not get on. Then the conductor said he would have a constable at Parkdale and have him arrest him there. Then we got on and the train went. Q. What else did Mr. Blain tell the conductor in addition to the assault?\nA. He told him that he thought he had threatened to attack him again.\nAnd Mrs. Blain, corroborating the general story adds, p. 74:\nQ. Was anything said as to what the conductor would do at Parkdale?\nA. He said he would have him arrested.\nA number of the passengers testify that the conductor and brakesman could have managed Anthony if they had tried to arrest him and each of the gentlemen says that, if asked by the conductor, they would have assisted to arrest the drunken man.\nIn regard to those passages from the evidence cited above, that relating to what transpired after the second assault I refer to as throwing light upon the attitude of the conductor. It seems to rebut all that was adduced in argument, as to the conductor having relied upon something that had gone before, lulling him into apathy. It indicates an entirely different frame of mind on the part of the conductor. He clearly did not, at the time, take the position that counsel now takes here, that by reason of what had transpired, after his promise at the Union Station to have the man arrested, he had been induced to change his mind by his observance of the man\u2019s condition or any other facts that would lead a reasonable man to believe the danger had passed away.\nHe seems, on the contrary, to have taken the stand even after the second assault, boldly upon the ground that he had no right or power or duty to interfere, unless the matter had come directly under his own eye.\nNo such position is open to a conductor under such circumstances. I take it he was in duty bound, upon finding the disturbance that existed in his train, and hearing the complaint that was made, to have taken due care to prevent a recurrence of such incidents as had been already explained to him.\nI think this evidence furnishes, within the principles laid down in The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Blain[25], which govern cases like this, sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to have the questions submitted to the jury which were submitted, and to support the findings of fact the jury have by their answers found, in relation to the circumstances in question.\nThere is no objection taken to the charge of the learned trial judge who seems to have left the case fairly to the jury, nor is there anything else in the trial of the case to indicate that it was not fairly tried. The results arrived at are wholly within the province of the jury, and I submit cannot be interfered with by this court.\nThe order granting a new trial left the whole case open as if nothing had transpired before the trial now in question. The case must therefore be considered, I think, solely in the light of the evidence given at that trial. It sometimes may be instructive to look at the facts of a previous decision to ascertain what the exact point, if not sufficiently illustrated in the opinion judgment, really was, that the court intended to decide. The doing so however, must always be liable to produce error, for when the facts are not set forth in the opinion judgment, it may well happen that some particular fact may have been overlooked, or may not have been presented in the same light that it may bear upon later and better argument. I have therefore not considered, beyond listening to the arguments of counsel upon the point, the facts that may have been reported as the result of the first trial. Counsel claims that the evidence did differ in this, and that is not denied though the materiality of the difference is questioned.\nI think, therefore, the judgment of the Divisional Court should be upheld, and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Angus McMurchy.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.O.

The original debt was to revive in full on default in payment of any of the composition notes. Upon receiving the composition notes the bank surrendered the notes representing the full amount of its claim.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, that the effect of the agreement coupled with the reservation made was that the debtor was to be discharged merely from personal liability on payment of the composition notes but that the securities were to be still held by the bank for the purpose of reimbursing itself, if possible, to the extent of the balance of the original debt.\nHeld, also, that the surrender of the original notes by the bank did not extinguish the debt they represented and under the circumstances there was no novation.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, maintaining th\u00e9 plaintiffs consolidated actions with costs.\nIn March, 1900, the plaintiff obtained a deed from his creditors for sums of $100 and upwards in composition and discharge of the debts owing by him to them, as follows;\u2014\n\" We the undersigned creditors of L. E. Beauchamp, of the City of Montreal, hereby agree to accept from him a composition of seventy-five cents in the dollar on the amount of our respective claims against him at this date; said composition payable by his notes at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months from 1st May next without interest, it being a condition to this agreement that Mrs. L. E., Beauchamp's claim will remain in abeyance till all the composition notes are fully paid. Said composition to be signed by all creditors for $100.00 and over. The real estate to be transferred to the Hochelaga Bank, Gault Bros. & Co. and J. G. Mackenzie & Co., till composition notes are fully paid.\n\" In case any of the instalments are not paid at maturity the balance of the original debt will revive in full. \"\n\" S.

Grenier & Cie., 3 et 6 mois.\nThe security held by the bank was an assignment of a debt of $5,000 owing to plaintiff by the telephone company, mise en cause. The debt due by the plaintiff to the bank, at the time of the signing of the deed, amounted to $12,985.60, and on execution of the composition thereby effected the bank received six notes from the plaintiff amounting to $9,839.20 and, thereupon, surrendered to the plaintiff his original notes then held by the bank, representing their full claim of $12,985.60.\nThe first three composition notes were duly paid to the bank which, in the meantime, had continued collecting from the telephone company on their collateral security, so that upon the maturity of the fourth composition note it had collected $4,350 on this security. The plaintiff asked to have this sum applied towards payment of the three last composition notes, but the bank refused to do so, contending that the reserve made in the deed entitled it not only to receive the amount of the composition at the rate of seventy-five cents in the dollar upon the amount of their full claim against the plaintiff, but also to make the remaining twenty-five cents in the dollar by realizing, if possible, upon the collateral security so reserved.\nThe plaintiff then brought two actions against the bank, which were subsequently consolidated, and the plaintiff's demandes therein were, in effect, granted by the trial court judge (Robidoux J.) affirmed by the judgment appealed from, which condemned the bank to return all the composition notes to the plaintiff and retransfer to him the collateral security or the balance due thereon.\nThe material questions at issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgment of the court as delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Nesbitt.\nBrosseau K. C. for the appellant.\nAngers K.C. and Beachamp K. C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nNESBITT J.\u2014The plaintiff being indebted to the bank in the sum of $12,800 for which the bank held as col- lateral security certain debts due from the company mise en cause to the plaintiff to the amount of about $5,000 asked his creditors for a composition at seventy-five cents on the dollar, said composition to be payable by his notes at three, six, nine, twelve, fifteen and eighteen months from the 1st May, 1900. All creditors of $100 and over were to sign. Certain of the creditors signed with a condition following their signatures that notes at three and six months should be given instead of the notes provided for in the deed, and one firm signed, excepting goods sold on a certain date. The bank signed by its general manager adding the words \" special reserve being made as to the securities which we hold.\"\nThe bank had collected from the Telephone Company about $4,500 and the plaintiff has paid them in addition some $4,869, which two sums added together would pay the seventy-five cents on the dollar due under the composition deed. The plaintiff claims that the money collected from the Telephone Company should be applied on the seventy-five cents on the dollar and that he should be entitled to receive the return of the balance of the claim against the Telephone Company and a return of his notes. And the bank claim that they are entitled to receive from him seventy-five cents on the dollar and to obtain, if possible, the other twenty-five cents on the dollar from the realisation of the collateral security.\nThe trial judge found in favour of the plaintiff and that judgment has been confirmed by a majority of the judges of the Court of King's Bench. The majority of the court below take the view that the reserve of the securities in the composition deed was a reserve to guarantee the payment of the seventy-five cents on the dollar. I think that the true construction of the bank's reservation when they signed the deed is that the bank say to the debtor, \" we will accept seventy-five cents on the dollar from you in full discharge of your personal liabilitity to us, but the collateral securities we have we will hold for whatever they may be worth, and to the extent of twenty-five cents on the dollar we will collect on them if we can.\"\nOf course any balance over the twenty-five cents would be accounted for. I think the view taken by Mr. Justice Hall in the court below was the correct one.\nTrue the original notes were given up by the bank to the respondent, but not to extinguish the debt, but for the purpose of being handed to the other creditors. These notes were, moreover, mere evidence of the debt and if it can be established that the latter was not extinguished or novated then it is in full force. The deed of composition declares in express terms that in case any of the instalments were not paid at maturity the balance of the original debt would revive in full.\nSome interesting questions presented themselves at the hearing arising out of the manner and expressed conditions under which the deed of composition was signed by the several creditors by virtue of which the necessary equality which the deed called for amongst the assenting creditors was destroyed. No question was raised before us on the point and in the view we take of the case it is not necessary to do more than refer to it to shew that we have not by our silence given an apparent sanction to such a proceeding.\nThe actions of the respondent should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Brosseau, Lajoie, Lacoste & Quigley.\nSolicitor for the respondent : J. E. Beauchamp.\n",

Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McKay (34 Can. S.C.R. 81) followed.\nThree persons were near a public road crossing when a freight train passed after which they attempted to pass over the track and were struck by a passenger train coming from the direction opposite to that of the freight train and killed. The passenger train was running at the rate of forty-five miles an hour, and it was snowing slightly at the time. On the trial of actions under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act against the Railway Company the jury found that the death of the parties was due to negligence \u201cin violating the statute by running at an excessive rate of speed\u201d and that deceased were not guilty of contributory negligence. A verdict for the plaintiff in each case was maintained by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld, that the Railway Company was liable; that the deceased had a right to cross the track and there was no evidence of want of care on their part and the same could not be presumed; and though there may not have been precise proof that the negligence of the company was the direct cause of the accident the jury could reasonably infer it from the facts proved and their finding was justified. McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Co. ([1905] A. C. 72) followed; Wakelin v. London & South Western Railway Co. (12 App. Cas. 41) distinguished\nHeld also, that the fact of deceased starting to cross the track two seconds before being struck by the engine was not proof of want of care; that owing to the snowstorm and the escaping steam and noise of the freight train they might well have failed to see the head-light or hear the approach of the passenger train if they had looked and listened.\nAPPEAL from decisions of the Court of Appeal for Ontario maintaining the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff in each of the three cases.\nThe facts of the case will be found in the above head-note and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Nesbitt on this appeal.\nThe cases were not consolidated in the Ontario courts but were tried together and argued together in the Court of Appeal whose decision was given on all three on the same day.\nRiddell K.C and Rose for the appellants. The speed of the train at over six miles an hour was not negligence. The limitation does not attach if the track is properly fenced and under The Railway Act, 1888, secs. 194 et seq., fencing is only required in townships.\nIf there was negligence plaintiffs have not proved that it was the direct cause of the accident and therefore cannot recover. Wakelin v. London & South Western Railway Co.[1]; Montreal Boiling Mills Co. v. Corcoran[2]; Canadian Coloured Cotton Mills Co. v. Kervin[3].\nStaunton K.C. and Lancaster for the respondents, cited Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Birkett[4]; Harris v. The King[5].\nSEDGEWICK and GIROUARD JJ. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Davies.\nDAVIES J.\u2014These actions were brought under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act to recover damages for the negligence of the defendant railway company causing the death of the three deceased persons who were killed in the village of Grimsby at a point where the appellants railway crosses Depot Street.\nThe jury found that the accident was due to the negligence of the railway company \u201cin violating the statute by running (their train) at an excessive rate of speed,\u201d and that the deceased persons \u201ccould not by the exercise of reasonable care have avoided the accident\u201d\nThe trial judge directed judgment to be entered in each case for the amount of the verdict rendered and the Court of Appeal refused to disturb the judgment so entered.\nThe main contentions of the railway company on this appeal were: 1st, that the statutory provisions limiting the rate of speed at which railway engines may pass through any thickly peopled portion of any city, town or village, to six miles an hour, unless the track was fenced in the manner prescribed by law had no application to crossings at villages because the duty to fence was only imposed by the statute in townships, and if the statute required no fence, and under the circumstances there was no necessity for cattle guards, section 197 did not apply; 2ndly, that there was no evidence to connect the alleged negligence with the accident; and thirdly, that the trial judge erred in refusing to charge the jury as to the duty of persons about to cross a railway track to look both ways for an approaching train.\nAs to the application of the statutory provisions regulating the rate of speed at which trains may run through thickly peopled portions of cities, towns or villages, we had occasion to consider the point very fully in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McKay[6], and I see no reason whatever to doubt the conclusions which we there reached. The controlling sections of the Act are the 197th and 259th. The latter expressly prescribes the limitation on the speed at which the trains are to cross the highways unless the track is fenced in manner prescribed by the Act, and the 197th section is imperative as to the fencing required. Where the prescribed fencing exists the limitation in speed does not apply, where the fencing is absent it does. There was no fencing at the railway crossing in the village of Grimsby where the accident occurred and the express train was admittedly running at the rate of forty-five miles an hour which, in my judgment, was in direct violation of the statute.\nMr. Riddell contended that there was no evidence connecting the statutory negligence with the accident and he relied upon Wakelin v. London and South Western Railway Co.[7], together with cases decided by this court as authority for the proposition that there must be either direct evidence shewing such connec- tion or presumptions weighty, precise and consistent to that effect.\nThere can, I take it, be no doubt as to the correctness of this general proposition. In the absence of any direct evidence or of facts from which an inference may reasonably be drawn that the accident was directly occasioned by the alleged negligence the defendants cannot be held liable. The late case of McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Company[8], is instructive upon the point that in certain cases it is not necessary to give exact proof of the fault which certainly caused the injury but that it is sufficient if the facts are such as to justify a reasonable inference that such was the case and exclude any other inference.\nBut the facts proved in this case do not appear to me to admit of any inference but one. The deceased parties were killed by the express train as they were going over the railway crossing, and the train was at the time running, in violation of the statute, at the rate of forty\u2011five miles an hour. No evidence of recklessness or want of care on the part of the deceased was offered. So far as the evidence did go they appeared to have acted as prudent persons should. There is here no reasonable room for conjecture. The parties themselves were all killed and no eye witness actually saw them killed. But the jury, on evidence which fully justified them in so finding, found as an irresistible inference from the facts that they were killed by the express train running at a rate of speed prohibited by statute. Under these circumstances I cannot see how the case of Wakelin v. South Western Railway Co.[9] at all applies. The circumstances there established were held to be equally as consistent with the allegations of the plaintiff which he was bound to prove as with the denial of the defendants. The conclusion to be drawn was essentially a matter of mere conjecture and that is not sufficient. In that case there was negligence proved but no proof that it was the immediate or proximate cause of the accident. The finding of the jury there was as the Lord Chancellor said \u201cwithout a fragment of evidence to justify it.\u201d In the absence of direct evidence there must of course be such facts proved that an inference may be reasonably drawn from them connecting the accident with the negligence and shewing the latter to have been the direct proximate cause of the accident. In this case I cannot see how any other inference could be reasonably drawn from the facts than that which the jury drew. It may well be that in negligence cases there is not and there ought not to be any necessary presumption either way as to facts requiring proof. The unfortunate persons who were killed on the occasion in question were proved to have been standing alongside of the track awaiting the passing of a freight train in front of them. They were proved to have been properly looking at the advancing freight train. The express train rushing along at forty-five miles an hour in an opposite direction to the freight train passed the latter after it had gone over the street crossing a very short distance. The time of night, the conditions of the weather, and the noise, dust and smoke caused by the freight train, all combined, might well have prevented them seeing the express approaching even if they did look. Only a few seconds elapsed, probably two, between the passing of the last car of the freight train one way over the crossing and the engine of the express train the other way. It was not necessary, in my opinion, to presume one way or the other as to their having looked to see if another train was approaching from the opposite direction to which the freight train was going. If they did look the existing circumstances as found might easily have prevented them seeing, and if the defendants have, in order to escape liability, to rely upon contributory negligence of the deceased parties the onus of proving it affirmatively, in the first instance at any rate, rests upon them and they have failed to discharge it. See judgments Lords Blackburn and Watson in Wakelin v. London and South Western Railway Co.9, at page 43.\nThe general rule as to the necessity of persons crossing a railway track or street car track looking both ways to see whether they can safely cross is a most salutary and proper one. But that it is not an absolute and arbitrary one admitting of no exceptions under any circumstances seems to be apparent from the late case of Barry Railway Co. v. White[10].\nIt seems to me however, clear that in the absence of any direct evidence on the point the finding of the jury of the absence of contributory negligence cannot under the circumstances of this case be open to any question. Neither party could or did give any direct or positive testimony, and the plaintiffs certainly were not bound to prove a negative in order to entitle them to verdicts in their favour.\nIt seemed to me at the argument and reflection has only further convinced me that when Mr. Riddell failed to sustain his contention as to the speed of the train not being in violation of the statute his other point vanished. If the train was being rushed through this thickly populated village at a rate of speed nearly eight times as great as that permitted by law that was of course an act of great negligence. If in crossing the highway at such speed the train killed the unfortunate people who while lawfully going along the highway were at the moment on the railway crossing it did seem a most unreasonable propo- sition in the absence of any negligence on their part to say\u2014the train was rushing along at a prohibited speed, it is true, but as the persons it struck are all killed and no one else saw the accident the company must not be held liable unless there is actual evidence that the deceased looked both ways for trains before going across the track. If such was the law the result would be that in most cases where the parties were killed outright such evidence would necessarily be wanting and the company would have complete immunity. The more reasonable doctrine is that to be found in McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Co.[11], before referred to, that the absence of exact proof of the fault which caused the injury is not necessarily fatal to the plaintiffs\u2019 case provided such fault can from the proved facts be reasonably inferred and is not mere conjecture. That is the principle on which I would base my judgment and applying it to the facts of the case as proved I think it fully justifies the verdicts found.\nThen with respect to the judge\u2019s charge, as to which exception has been taken, I have read it most carefully and I am bound to say that taking it as a whole, as we are bound to do, I do not think it open to serious objection.\nNESBITT J.\u2014These are three actions brought under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act to recover damages for the death of two young women and a young man, who were killed on the defendants\u2019 line of railway (at Grimsby station), as alleged, by their negligence.\nThe question for us is whether the learned judge at that trial ought to have withdrawn the case from the jury and directed a verdict for the defendants. I was of opinion at the conclusion of the very able argument which was addressed to us at great length by counsel for both parties that the judgment in favour of the plaintiffs was wrong and that the defendants were either entitled to a new trial or to have had a non-suit entered for them at the close of the case. A careful perusal and consideration of the evidence has, however, convinced me that the judgment in favour of the plaintiffs should be affirmed and the appeal dismissed with costs. While the learned judge\u2019s charge to the jury may be open in two particulars to criticism I think it it is substantially correct and that he was right in not withdrawing the case from the jury. As, however, there was a great deal of discussion upon the various points involved I propose stating what I conceive to be the result of the authorities in each of the questions involved.\nThe evidence is that the defendants operate at this point two main lines of railway, Grimsby being situated midway between Niagara Falls and Hamilton. There are also at the point in question several sidings. On the night of Sunday, the 7th December, 1902, at about 8.30, the young women and the young man having been at church were returning to their homes and in so returning were obliged to cross several of the sidings, and as they came up to the south main track a freight train consisting of about forty cars and drawn by an engine was passing to the east. The three persons who were killed were last seen standing about eight feet south of the south track of the defendants\u2019 railway apparently waiting for the freight train to pass. The last cars of the freight train having gone completely past the crossing met the engine of the express going west at a distance of three or four car lengths from the crossing just east of the station, so that at the moment the engine of the express passed the rear cars at a distance of from one to two hundred feet from the crossing the three per- sons must have attempted to cross the track and proceeded about eight or ten feet when they were struck and killed. The express was going at the rate of about forty-five miles an hour which would make it travel about sixty-six feet per second, so that from when it passed the rear cars of the freight train to the time it would go over the level crossing would be between two and three seconds, and if the deceased moved forward at say three miles per hour they would cover about nine feet in two seconds. The evidence seemed clear that standing where deceased were eight or ten feet from the track the head light of the approaching engine could under ordinary conditions be seen for a considerable distance down the track. There was evidence that there was a little wind from the west with light flurries of snow and that a freight train passing, as the one in question did, necessarily raised a considerable quantity of dust and smoke which would probably obscure the head-light and the noise made by the freight train would almost certainly drown the noise of the approaching express.\nThe negligence charged was the running of the express at this point at an excessive rate of speed under the provisions of section 259 of the Railway Act as amended by 55 & 56 Vict., ch. 27, sec. 8, which is in the following language:\nNo locomotive or railway engine shall pass in or through any thickly peopled portion of any city, town or village, at a speed greater than six miles an hour unless the track is fenced in the manner prescribed by this Act.\nAs I have said the evidence was clear that the train was running at not less than forty-five miles an hour. The plaintiffs also charged negligence in not giving the statutory signals of bell or whistle. This I may dispose of at once by saying that the evidence seems clearly to negative this charge of negligence, and the jury must also be taken to have negatived this charge as they only found the negligence to consist of excessive speed. It was also charged that the company was negligent in not having provided a gate or watchman at the crossing. This is disposed of by this court in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McKay[12], which had not then been decided in this court. The only negligence upon which plaintiffs relied at the argument before this court was excessive speed under this section of the Railway Act I have quoted. Mr. Riddell argued that this section was not applicable as the crossing was in an incorporated village and that the only fencing prescribed by the Act was under section 194 of the general Railway Act, and sec. 6 of 55 & 56 Vict. ch. 27, which latter is in the words following:\nAt every public road crossing at road level of the railroad the fences on both sides of the crossing and on both sides of the track shall be turned into the cattle guards so as to allow the safe passage of trains.\nMr. Riddell argued that as section 194 only prescribes the building of a fence on each side of the railway through the organized townships, that there was no liability to fence in cities, towns or villages, and section 259 did not apply; that as the object of the Act in maintaining cattle guards and return fences so as to prevent horses, cattle, sheep or swine, etc., from getting on the track was to provide for the safety of passengers the statute having created a duty with the object of preventing a mischief of a particular kind persons who by reason of a neglect of the statutory duty suffered a loss of a different kind were not entitled to maintain an action in respect of such loss. This doctrine is of course well recognized in such cases as Gorris v. Scott[13]; Buxton v. North Eastern Railway Co.[14]; Vanderkar v. The Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad Co.[15]. In the last named case it was held that the provision in the statute of 1848 requiring railroad companies to construct and maintain cattle guards at all road crossings sufficient and suitable to prevent cattle and other animals from getting on the railroad, does not apply to cities and villages because the statute made an obvious distinction between streets or villages and townships; also Parker v. Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad Co.[16], where the same doctrine was affirmed. See also Pollock on Torts (7 ed.), p. 26; Hardcastle on Statutes (2 ed.), 255; Beven on Negligence (2 ed.), 764; Cleveland Railway Co. v. Wynant[17]. I do not think the principle in these cases can be made to apply to the case at bar. Section 6, which I have quoted above, seems to make cattle-guards and return-fences imperative at every public road crossing at road level, and this being a public road crossing within the limits of an incorporated village is not fenced in the manner prescribed by the Act, and I do not think that this fencing is prescribed for the same reasons as the fencing required by section 194 in townships.\nIt was argued that the trial judge should have nonsuited on the authority of the case of Wakelin v. London & South Western Railway Co.[18], at page 45, and that that case was not distinguishable from the present case, inasmuch as assuming negligence on the part of the defendants the evidence fell short of proving that the immediate and proximate cause of the calamity was the negligence of the defendants. The court stated it was left to mere conjecture as to whether it was the causa causans, and that the plaintiffs undertook to establish negligence as a fact and that such negligence was the cause of the death of the deceased. If in this case it had been shewn that the defendants were approaching the track or standing within a few feet of it when last seen, and that the train was approaching in clear view or its approach could be distinctly heard by any one paying due attention, and that if the deceased had looked or listened they must have seen or heard the approaching train, I think it would have been the bounden duty of the trial judge to non-suit. But that is not this case. The jury have a right to infer that the deceased attempted to cross the track and while there is no presumption that they behaved with care (as to which I will speak later), there is no presumption that they behaved recklessly, and as the evidence fails in the important link for the defendants that it does not establish that if the deceased had looked they could have either heard the train or seen it but owing to the noise of the freight and the obscurity created by the smoke and dust the contrary is to be inferred, I think the case must go to the jury to establish contributory negligence in the deceased, and as the jury have negatived that the defendants must fail. In the Wakelin Case19 there was nothing to shew how the accident occurred. Here there is only one conclusion to be drawn, viz. that the deceased started to cross two seconds before the passenger engine arrived at the crossing, and the difficulty for the defendants is that it is a question of fact whether by using due care the deceased could have seen or heard the train with the dust, smoke and noise, and so the case must go to the jury. The line is an extremely narrow one but I desire to repeat that had it appeared by the evidence in this case for the plaintiffs that the defendants were guilty of negligence, yet, had the deceased exercised that care both of sight and hearing that they were bound to exercise they must have seen or heard the approaching train then there would have been nothing for the jury because there would have been a failure on the part of the plaintiffs to prove that the negligence established was the immediate and proximate cause of the calamity and the court would have been left to mere conjecture as to whether the accident occurred owing to the defendants\u2019 negligence or to the negligence of the deceased in not looking. But where, as in this case, the evidence establishes that even if the deceased exercised due care the accident might occur, then, I think, the case must be submitted to the jury. It was urged most strenuously that the court had a right to assume that the deceased were aware that the law required the company to run at this point at a rate not exceeding six miles an hour because of the failure to fence, and therefore had a right to assume that they had plenty of time to cross. I entirely disagree with this suggestion. In the first place I think the reasonable assumption is that people living in the immediate neighbourhood of the station would be likely to be aware that the express train which was due at this hour was accustomed to pass at the rate of forty-five miles an hour and upwards, and I think it is somewhat a violent assumption that the deceased would be aware that the court would subsequently to the accident declare that the express train was violating the law in running at this point at this high rate of speed, or that the construction I have put upon the statute in the present case was the proper construction. I do not think that the court can assume in the face of our common knowledge that trains do run at this high rate of speed and that people are accustomed to see them run at this high rate of speed in violation of section 259 that any such consideration entered into the calculations of the deceased before attempting to cross the track. I think such presumptions in the face of our common knowledge of their falsity come well within the description of \u201cmonstrous propositions\u201d referred to by Lord Esher in Ex parte Mercer; In re Wise[19], when he was asked to draw a presumption in a very different type of case but a presumption which he felt was entirely inconsistent with the facts and which he refused to draw, notwithstanding the proposition had the support of dicta of great and eminent judges. I think that if a man looks and sees a coming train and crosses with full knowledge of its approach he does so at his own risk. I think also that if he is ignorant when under the circumstances as between him and the company he ought to have known that the train was approaching, his legal position does not differ from that which it would have been if he had actually known what by using due care he would have known. To hold otherwise would be to enable a person to take advantage of his own wrong. And here, were it not for the fact that the evidence discloses that even if the deceased were careful the accident could still have happened because the noise of the freight train would probably prevent the sound of the express train being heard, and the dust and smoke of the freight and the flurries of snow would probably prevent the train being seen, I would unhesitatingly hold the plaintiffs could not recover. It was argued that the cases in this court of Montreal Rolling Mills Co. v. Corcoran[20]; Canadian Coloured Cotton Mills v. Kervin[21]; and also Young v. Owen Sound Dredge Co.[22], and Brown v. Waterous Engine Works Co.[23], were qualified by the recent decision of the Privy Council in McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Co.[24]. I am unable to accede to this contention. I do not think that the McArthur Case24 has made any change in the law. It was admitted in that case that there was no proof of contributory negligence. It was not pretended that the accident could be accounted for as coming under the head of inevitable accident, nor was it contended that there could be any reasonable explanation of the mishap other than that insisted on by the plaintiff, viz., that the evidence disclosed that cartridges were occasionally presented in a wrong posture and that the final blow or punch which was necessary to complete the operation of manufacture because of this wrong posture sometimes fell on the side of the cartridge and sometimes on the metal end in which the percussion cap had been inserted, and that such presenting of the cartridges in a wrong posture was due to the defective working of the automatic fingers which the company\u2019s superintendent had designed. There was also apparently a defect in the outside powder box in this that the explosion which should have spent itself in the open air took effect inwards. The Privy Council said the jury very properly inferred, and could only infer, that the accident happened through the negligence of the defendants. The Privy Council also held that in that particular case of an explosion where the accident was the work of a moment and its origin and cause incapable of being detected the necessity for proof existing in other classes of cases was dispensed with. I cannot see that the McArthur Case24, which is sui generis, has in any way interfered with the doctrine laid down in the other cases I have referred to or with the doctrine in Wakelin\u2019s Case[25]. I entirely dissent from the view expressed by Armour, Chief Justice of Ontario, in Young v Owen Sound Dredge Co.[26] that the cases in this court had gone far beyond the Wakelin Case[27]. I agree with the result of his judgment and think that the ground upon which the judgment should have been based was that stated both by Mr. Justice Osler and Mr. Justice Lister in the same case\nthat the evidence failed to show how the unfortunate man fell off the boat.\nIn this case the deceased had a right, using due care, to cross the track, and there is no evidence that with the exercise of that due care the accident would not have happened. On the contrary the evidence would seem to indicate that under the peculiar circumstances of this case the deceased, using every care both in looking and listening, would probably have met their death. It is to be observed that the time when they could first see the train until the accident happened was a period of about two seconds, and that looking and listening two seconds before they stepped upon the track the evidence is that probably they would not have seen or heard the train. There is no doubt that the accident happened by their being struck by the swiftly approaching train.\nOn the question of new trial, I have said there were certain portions of the charge open to criticism. The learned trial judge, in one part of his charge, stated to the jury that\nthey must assume that the deceased were not guilty, unless there was evidence to show that they were guilty, of contributory negligence.\nHad this stood alone I should have thought a new trial should have been directed but I think it was corrected by his direction in other parts of the case. I think that there is no presumption one way or the other. The true rule is laid down in the recent case of Pomfret v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Co.[28], where Collins M.R. says:\nIn the present case the county court judge has based his judgment upon his right to assume that everything has been properly done; he has relied upon the proposition \u201comnia prcesumuntur rite esse acta;\u201d but I do not think that that is the correct view to take, or that there is any such presumption in such a case as that before us, for in Wakelin v. London and South Western Railway Co.[29], the House of Lords declined to act upon the presumption that the deceased man had behaved with care.\nIt was urged that in Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Gentry[30], the Supreme Court of the United States had drawn an opposite presumption, and so the head-note appears, but an examination of that case where the doctrine is dealt with at page 367 does not seem to me to justify the head-note but, on the contrary, seems to me to be in accord with the English doctrine. The court says:\nThose who are crossing a railroad track are bound to exercise ordinary care and diligence to ascertain whether a train is approaching. They have, indeed, incentive to caution, for their lives are in imminent danger if collision happen; and hence it will not be presumed, without evidence, that they do not exercise proper care. This principle was approved in Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Co. v. Griffith[31]. Manifestly it was not the duty of the court when there was no evidence as to the deceased having or not having looked and listened for approaching trains before crossing the railroad track, to do more touching the question of contributory negligence than it did, namely, instruct the jury generally that the railroad company was not liable if the deceased, by his own neglect, contributed to his death, and that they could not find for the plaintiffs unless the death of the deceased was directly caused by unsafe switching appliances used by the defendant, and without fault or negligence on his part.\nThis seems to be nothing more than saying there is no presumption one way or the other. The learned trial judge in this case also declined to charge that it was the duty of a man \u201cunder all circumstances\u201d on approaching a railway track to look both ways to see whether a train was coming from either direction. I think as an abstract statement of law this is not correct and the learned judge was right in refusing to so charge. I also think that the judge did charge that, so far as the circumstances of the case were con- cerned, the deceased were bound to recognize that the trains were running both ways and that the degree of care that they did exercise he proposed to leave to the jury. As, however, the question was strenuously argued in this court as a ground of misdirection and the question as to whether it is the duty of a person approaching a railway track to look in both directions and listen for a train before crossing has been much discussed I propose to state shortly the authorities both in England, the United States and this country upon the subject I think the best discussion of the English authorities is to be found in the case of Coyle v. The Great Northern Railway Co.[32], in the judgment of Chief Baron Palles. It is to be remembered that the judgment of Lord Cairns in the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Co. v. Slattery,[33] which is always relied upon for the doctrine that a person is not bound to look under all circumstances, was a judgment affirming a refusal by Chief Baron Palles to non-suit in that case, and therefore Chief Baron Palles\u2019 analysis of that with other authorities is particularly valuable, and the result of his analysis is that all the cases establish that the plaintiffs conduct in crossing the line without looking, which is prim\u00e2 facie negligence, may lose its character of negligence by reason of its being induced by the conduct of the company in stating in effect \u201cthere is no necessity to look, for the train is not coming\u201d, or in other words, an act which would be negligent per se may cease to be negligent by reason of the invitation of the company to do the act which otherwise would have been negligence. There may be evidence of acts or omissions on the part of the company by which he might have been put off his guard and allowed to suppose that the might safely act as he did, namely, cross without looking, and in every case where a person who has not looked has succeeded against a negligent defendant there was such a departure from the ordinary usage or such other act on the part of the defendant as might reasonably have been held to be an inducement to cross, a statement by the company that a person was safe in crossing. Apart from this I think the cases clearly establish that if a man actually looks and sees a coming train and crosses with full knowledge of its approach he does so at his own risk; that, except as I have indicated, he is bound to look and to listen under the doctrine of using due care. A man does not use due care who does not look and listen unless he has been thrown off his guard by the company in the way I have indicated, and if it appears that had he used due care, (that is, looked and listened), he must have seen or heard the approaching train, he is guilty of such negligence as disentitles him from recovering. As I have pointed out, in Jamieson v. Harris[34], recently decided, the question of speed is not as a rule very important. The accident could not have happened unless the person was at that particular moment on that portion of the line. Had the train been faster he would not have been there; had the train been slower he would not have been there; had he been faster or slower he would not have been there. But the point is that his negligence in not using due care in looking or listening has brought him at that point at that particular moment and his negligence is therefore the causa sine qua non of his injury or death and is a contributory cause of his injury or death and so he cannot recover. This conclusion is justified by a long series of decisions. In this country I would refer to Nicholls v. The Great Western Railway Co.[35]; Johnson v. Northern Railroad Co.[36]; Winckler v. Great Western Railway Co.[37]. In the Nichols Case35 the Chief Justice says, in referring to parties crossing a track without looking:\u2014\nIf parties so acting can recover it must be solely on the ground that the defendants are a railway company and to hold them entitled, to damage notwithstanding the total disregard of their own safety is to encourage carelessness and endanger human life.\nIn the Winckler Case37 it is said, at page 264:\nThen as to the necessity of the driver maintaining a look out, it is quite manifest that this was his duty; he cannot go on at all hazards because the other party is in fault. If this were so it would have been right of the plaintiff to have killed the donkey in Davies v. Mann[38].\nAnd at page 269 Wilson J. says:\nThe defendants have a right to run their trains and they can neither go to the right nor left, nor can they stop them at once. Knowing all this, the legislature gave the defendants the right to run their trains and, I think, cast the duty upon those who cross their track not to rush in the way of their trains when in motion, which they cannot control.\nIn the Johnson Case[39] the court said:\nIt is the duty of the traveller approaching a railway crossing to look along the line of railway track and see if any train is coming, and if he fails to take such precaution, and an accident happens, it is more than evidence of negligence in the traveller; it is little short of recklessness for any one to drive on to the track of a railway without first looking and listening to ascertain whether a moving locomotive is near. * * * * In general terms a neglect of duty on the part of a railway company will not excuse a person approaching a crossing from using the sense of sight and hearing, where those senses may be available; and when the use of either of these faculties would give sufficient warning to enable the party to avoid the danger contributory negligence is shown.\nIn England, Chief Baron Pollock, in Stubley v. The London & North Western Railway Co.[40], says that a railway\nis in itself a warning of danger to those about to go upon it, and cautions them to see whether a train is coming.\nAnd Channell B. in the same case says:\nBut passengers crossing the rails are bound to exercise ordinary and reasonable care for their own safety, and to look this way and that to see if danger is to be apprehended. And in Skelton v. London and North Western Railway Co.[41], Bovill C.J, in answer to the argument that the gate being open the deceased had a right to assume that the line was clear, says:\nThe deceased could not have supposed that the position of the ring showed that the line was clear, because the coal train was standing before the gate, and, if the crossing was rendered dangerous by obstruction to the view it only made, it more incumbent upon him to take due care. There is no evidence, however, that the deceased took any care or caution whatever. When he reached the first line of rails he could have seen three hundred yards, but it appears from the evidence that he did not look either to the right or left, but walked heedlessly on, and it was owing to this want of caution on his part that the accident occurred.\nSee also Cliff v. The Midland Railway Co.[42]; Ellis v. The Great Western Railway Co.[43]; Davey v. The London & South Western Railway Co.[44]; Curlin v. Great Southern & Western Railway Co. of Ireland[45]. In Allen v. North Metropolitan Tramways Co.[46], the court was composed of Lord Esher M.R. and Lindley and Bowen L.JJ. It was a case where the accident happened upon a bridge upon which two tramway lines coalesced and the plaintiff when endeavouring to cross the road looked only in one direction and not in the direction from which the car was coming. There was some evidence that the car was going fast, and there was evidence that the plaintiff did not hear the car coming owing perhaps to the ground being covered with snow. The court, overruling the Divisional Court, held that it was clear from these facts that the plaintiff had only himself to blame for the accident. He walked into the tram car when if he had looked he must have seen it. In Lake Erie & Detroit River Railway Co. v. Marsh[47], upon an application for leave this court assumed that the law was as I have stated. The American authorities are very explicit. Mr. Justice Field, of the Supreme Court of the United States, in Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad Co. v. Houston[48], says, at page 701:\nIf the positions most advantageous to the plaintiff be assumed as correct, that the train was moving at an unusual rate of speed, its bell was not rung, and its whistle not sounded, it is still difficult to see on what ground the accident can be attributed to the \u201cnegligence, unskilfulness or criminal intent\u201d of the defendant\u2019s engineer. * * * She, the deceased, was bound to listen and to look before attempting to cross the railroad track, in order to avoid an approaching train, and not to walk carelessly into places of possible danger. Had she used her senses she could not have failed to both hear and see that the train was coming. If she omitted to use them, and walked thoughtlessly upon the track, she was guilty of culpable negligence, and so far contributed to her injuries as to deprive her of any right to complain of others. If, using them, she saw the train coming, and yet undertook to cross the tract instead of waiting for the train to pass and was injured, the consequence of her mistake and temerity cannot be cast upon the defendant.\nThis case was reaffirmed in Texas and Pacific Railroad Co. v. Gentry[49], which I have already referred to.\nIn the State Courts it has been held in the case of Gorton v. The Erie Railway Company[50], at page 664:\u2014\nBut these obstacles, if they existed, and hid from view the railroad and approaching trains to the extent claimed, did not relieve the plaintiff from the duty of looking for an east-bound train at the first opportunity, but rather rendered a cautious approach to the crossing the more necessary. Upon the undisputed evidence that, if the plaintiff had looked to the west, as he approached and reached the north track of the railroad, he could have seen the approaching train and that he did not look, he should have been non-suited.\nAnd again, in McGrath v. The New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Co.[51], the Court of Appeal says:\u2014\nIn respect to a person travelling on a highway which is crossed by a railroad it has been settled, by a series of adjudications in this state, that he is bound on approaching the crossing to look and listen if by doing so he can discover the proximity of a moving train, and that the omission to do so is an omission of ordinary care which will prevent his recovering for an injury which might have been avoided if he had used his faculties of sight and hearing.\nAnd again in Salter v. The Ulica and Black River Railroad Co.[52]\nThe principle which requires that a man should use his ears and eyes in crossing a railroad track, so far as he has opportunity to do so, equally demands that he shall employ his faculties in managing his teams, and thus keep out of danger, and the fact that the view was obstructed for a certain distance imposed the greater obligation of holding his team in check.\nAnd in Butterfield v. The Western Railroad Corporation[53], the plaintiff was struck while crossing the railroad on a highway. The night was dark and stormy and he did not look, although he listened for a train, relying upon a signal to apprise him of its approach. The Supreme Court held, assuming that the duty of sounding the bell or whistle was violated and that the plaintiff had a right to expect those signals to be given, that this did not relieve him from the use of both eyes and ears as he approached the crossing, and that a failure to do so was negligence and the plaintiff could not recover.\nSee also Central Railroad Co. of New Jersey v. Feller[54].\nIn Gardner v. Detroit, Lansing and Northern Railroad Co.[55], the court says, at page 244:\nWe think the court below should have entered judgment for defendant upon the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony and the findings of the jury. It was found that when the plaintiff was within five feet of the north rail he could, if he had looked, have seen eastward on the track a distance of two hundred and fifty feet. There was nothing to obstruct his view if he had looked * * * It is apparent, from the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony, that he was not exercising due care in going over these tracks, A railway track is, in itself, notice and warning of danger, and we have repeatedly held that it is the duty of a person to look and listen before venturing upon it.\nIn New Jersey, in the case of Delaware, Lackawana & Western Railroad Co. v. Hofferan[56], the court says: A railroad track is a place of danger and any one who incautiously places himself upon it, and sustains damage in consequence of such carelessness, is entirely remediless. The law requires of all persons approaching such a point of peril the exercise of a reasonable caution, and if this duty is neglected, and an accident thereby occurs, it says to those who are thus in default that they must bear the ill which is the product in whole or in part of there own folly,\u201d Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Matthew[57]. The deceased was nut relieved of the duty of exercising the highest practicable degree of care in avoiding the danger to himself, and of looking each way for an approaching train, before crossing, because of the neglect of the defendant in failing to give proper statutory signals by ringing the bell or blowing the whistle on the locomotive.\nSee also Barnum v. Grand Trunk Western Railway Co.[58]; Garlich v. Northern Pacific Railway Co.[59]\nI have cited these cases to demonstrate that the law, except where there are special circumstances such as I have indicated in discussing the Coyle Case[60], implies negligence if a person fails to take due care in approaching or crossing a railway crossing, and that due care means looking and listening.\nIt would scarcely be urged that if a man attempted to cross Broadway, in New York, where cable cars are seldom more than fifty or sixty feet apart, that he could recover if it was shown that he attempted to cross without looking in both directions. He would expect in that situation cars at any moment, and therefore he would be guilty of a want of due care in not looking. I conceive that if he is aware that he is crossing a railway track that he must in the same way expect a train at any moment and that unless he is misled into security by some act or omission of the company he is the author of his own injury if he meets with injury in crossing without looking.\nThe case of Barry Railway Co. v. White[61], was urged as assuming a doctrine different from what I have indicated. I do not so read the case. That was a case of lines of railway running alongside a dock, and the man injured was crossing these lines to get to the boat on which he was an engineer, the boat then lying in the dock; and his case was that he had no reason to expect a train and was not therefore negligent in not looking before crossing the track in question. It is quite true the defendants urged that the place where the accident occurred was in the nature of a shunting yard for goods traffic, and that the man injured should look behind him as well as in front of him before stepping on to the line. The report is not very clear and I do not find that the case is elsewhere reported, and it would seem to me not an ordinary case of railway crossing but to be a case where it must be a question for the jury whether the person crossing had a right to expect a train to approach without signals, the railway tracks being apparently in the dock yard. Nothing can be gathered from the judgment of the Lord Chancellor in directing a new trial, and I do not think the case throws any light upon the discussion. In my view there is no real clash in the cases upon the subject, although I admit that where the law of negligence is concerned the quotation by Baron Dowse from the Poet Laureate\u2019s lines are most apt when he speaks of:\nThe lawless science of our law\u2014\nThat codeless myriad of precedents;\nThat wilderness of single instances.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think that there was evidence in this case that had to be submitted to the jury and that the learned trial judge could not properly have withdrawn it from their consideration.\nI see nothing in the learned judge\u2019s charge that can properly be complained of as misdirection.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that this appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.H.

Mercer[4].\nNewcombe K.C. is heard for the Dominion. Parliament is given exclusive legislative jurisdiction over ferries between a province and any British or foreign country, or between two provinces. These are the ferries dealt with in the legislation in question.\nA provincial legislature could not control a ferry outside of the province. The right must necessarily be with parliament.\nSection 109 of the British North America Act only refers to royalties connected with \"lands, mines and. minerals,\" and not to the prerogative rights in question here.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014These questions should, in my opinion, be answered in the affirmative. The policy of the British North America Act is to leave all international or interprovincial undertakings within the federal power. And that, it is evident, must necessarily be so as to ferries. Taking for instance a ferry on the Ottawa River between Ontario and Quebec, neither Ontario nor Quebec has the right to effectually grant a license for a ferry abutting on the opposite shore over which it has no jurisdiction. And if wthe provinces have not that right the federal parliament must have it. Such a ferry was not situate, and the right to it did not arise, either in Ontario or in Quebec at the time of the Union, and consequently sec. 109 of British North America Act has no application. And if sec. 109 does not apply, sec. 102 does, and the revenues from these licenses belong to the federal authority, under whose legislative control they have been specially put by the British North America Act, for greater certainty. The Fisheries Case[5] is clearly distinguishable. There were no proprietary rights at the union in ferries between the two provinces vested in either one or the other of these two provinces.\nNo provincial legislature could incorporate a company to run a ferry between the two provinces, and no provincial government could itself be granted by its legislature the power to run an exclusive ferry between two provinces. The Dominion Parliament alone could do it, and fix the price of the license to the company upon such additional terms and conditions as it saw fit to enact.\nSEDGEWICK and GIROUARD JJ. concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Nesbitt.\nNESBITT J.\u2014The question referred to this court is as follows:\n1. (a) Is Chapter 97 of the Revised Statutes of Canada intituled \"An Act respecting Ferries as amended by the Act passed in the 51st year of the reign of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria, Chapter 28. intituled \"An Act to amend the Revised Statutes of Canada, chapter 97, respecting Ferries\", intra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\n(b) If the said Act, as so amended, is intra vires in part only, which sections or provisions thereof are ultra vires or to what extent is the said Act ultra vires?\n2. (a) Has the Parliament of Canada authority to establish or create or authorise the Governor General in Council to establish or create ferries between a province and any British or foreign country, or between two provinces and (b) Is it competent to the Governor General in Council, if thereunto authorised by the Parliament of Canada, to grant or convey by way of license or otherwise an exclusive right to any such ferry?\nThe doubt has arisen owing to a decision of Mr. Justice Street in a case of Perry v. Clergue[6], in which that learned judge held that a ferry was an incorporeal hereditament the title to which remained in the Province under section 109 of the British North America Act and that the power conferred by section 91, s.s. 13, was merely a power of regulation of the ferry when created by the Provincial authority similar to the power which the Dominion has relative to fisheries.\nOn the 3rd July, 1797, the statute 37 George III, chapter 10 (in the Revised Statutes of Upper Canada) was passed intituled An Act for the Regulation of Ferries\". This statute authorised the justices of the peace in quarter sessions to make such rules and regulations for the governance of ferries and also for the regulation of tolls as might be thought proper and penalties were imposed for any overcharge and so forth.\nIn 1853 a statute was passed by the Parliament of Canada, 16 Victoria, chapter 212, intituled \"An Act to regulate Ferries beyond the local limits of the Municipalities in Lower Canada.\"\nThis statute repealed previous statutes and provided that\nfrom and after the time when the Act shall come into force no person shal act as a ferryman, etc. or shall convey or cause to be conveyed by any one in his service any person across any river, stream, lake or water within Lower Canada and not wholly within the local limits of any municipality thereof without having received a license under the hand of the Governor of the Province etc.\n[Page ]\nPowers were conferred upon the Governor in Council to make and from time to time to repeal or alter regulations for establishing the extent and limit of all such ferries; for defining the manner in which the conditions including any duty or sum to be paid for the license under which and the period for which licenses shall be granted in respect of all such ferries; for fixing tolls and so forth. Section 7 of this statute provided that all moneys arising out of such ferry licenses and out of penalties incurred in regard to the same or otherwise under this Act should form part of consolidated revenue fund.\nIn 1855 the Province of Canada passed a statute, 18 Victoria, chapter 100, intituled \"Lower Canada Municipal and Road Act, 1855\". This statute by section 42 dealt with the ferries. It provided that ferries, in cases where both sides of the river or water to be crossed lie within the same local municipality, should be under the control of the municipal council.\nIt provided by subsection 3 that the moneys arising from any licenses for a ferry should if the ferry be under the control of a local municipality, belong to such municipality and if it be under the control of the county council they should belong one moiety to each of the local municipalities between which the ferry lies and such moneys should be applied to road purposes.\nSub-sec. (4) provided that ferries in cases where both sides of the river or water to be crossed did not lie within the same county should continue to be regulated and governed as they then were.\nIn 1857 a statute was passed by the Parliament of Canada, 20 Victoria, chapter 7, intituled \"An Act to amend the laws regulating ferries so as to encourage the employment of steamboats and ferryboats in Upper Canada.\"\nThe preamble recites that \"whereas it is necessary and expedient to afford greater inducements than now by law exist for the purpose of establishing steam ferries in Upper Canada, and it is necessary to amend the law regulating ferries.\"\nIt then provides that a license to have a steam ferry between two municipalities may be granted to municipalities in Upper Canada by the Governor\u2014a condition being imposed that the craft to be used for the purpose of such ferry shall be propelled by steam.\nA provision was made permitting the municipalities to sublet the ferries for such price and upon such terms and at such conditions as to rates of ferriage, etc., as the municipalities might see fit, but providing that in so subletting the said municipality or munipalities should not in any way contravene the terms of the license from the Crown.\nSection 5 of this statute deals with ferries on the provincial frontier, and it provides:\nAnd as in order to encourage the establishment of good ferries for the accommodation of commerce on the line of the provincial frontier, it is essential to place the control and management of the same in the municipalities immediately interested, no license in future shall be granted to any person or body corporate beyond the limits of the province, but such license in all cases shall be granted to the municipalities within the limits of which such ferry exists.\nThese statutes related only to Upper Canada. At the time of confederation the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada of 1859 were in force. The first section of chapter 46 of these statutes related to ferries on the frontier line of Upper Canada and was a consolidation of the two statutes, 20 Victoria hereinbefore referred to, and 22 Victoria, ch. 41.\nThe provisions of this statute other than the first and second sections clearly apply to ferries other than. ferries on the frontier line of Upper Canada. The Confederation Act was then passed which by section 91 conferred upon the Parliament of Canada authority to legislate in regard to ferries between a province and any British or foreign country or between two provinces.\nSec. 91, subsec. 10, as to navigation and shipping.\nSec. 91, subsec. 13, ferries between a province and any British or foreign country or between two provinces.\nSec. 92, subsec. 10, as to lines of steam or other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs and other works and undertakings connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces or extending beyond the limits of the province, lines of steamships between the provinces and any British or foreign country.\nAt this time the right to issue a license for a ferry was in no sense the same as the title to land.\nUpon the grant of a license for a ferry, or if a ferry were obtained by prescription in the hands of the licensees, the interest therein might be treated as in the nature of an incorporeal hereditament, but the right to grant (while vested in the Crown) was controlled by the legislature. It was a grant or license under the Great Seal.\nIt would appear that the Crown had abandoned certain prerogative rights leaving them to the control of the legislature, such as granting of charters, and that the exercise of such a power by the Crown, certainly in the colonies, might be treated as obsolete, and therefore when the subject of fines was mentioned it covered the power or authority to create the ferry which only when created became a species of property. It seems singular that apparently the provinces could not create a company to operate a ferry between provinces or a province and a foreign territory and yet could create the ferry itself, and it seems to me reasonably clear that the creation of such a company with such powers is not within the enumerated provincial powers.\nI think it is obvious, having regard to the whole scheme of confederation, that the intention of the British North America Act was to place within the sole control of the Dominion Parliament all rights affecting navigation between the Dominion and any foreign country and as well the right to legislate as to grants of a ferry between the Dominion and a foreign country.\nThe Legislature of Ontario have so dealt with the subject.\nThe earliest consolidation of the statutes of Ontario is by the Revised Statutes of Ontario passed in 1877. In the appendix A to these statutes there is a list of the Acts contained in the Consolidated Statutes for Canada and Upper Canada published in 1859 \"shewing to what extent those which are of a public general nature and within the legislative authority of the Legislature of Ontario remain in force and how they have been dealt with in the revision of the statutes.\"\nOn page 2301 of this volume, chapter 46 of the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, 1859, is referred to and this statute is consolidated except section 1. This sec. 1 deals with frontier ferries, and the same appendix, on the same page, shews that the subject matter of frontier ferries has been dealt with by the Dominion by 33 Victoria, chapter 35.\nIn 1892 the Municipal Act was passed by the Parliament of Ontario, 55 Victoria, chapter 42; section 287 of this statute enacts that \"a council may grant exclusive privileges in any ferry which may be vested in a corporation represented by such council other than a ferry between a province of the Dominion of Canada and any British or foreign country or between two Provinces of the Dominion\" and further provisions were enacted by the same statute by section 495 subsec. (4).\nOn the doctrine of Parliamentary interpretation, which I have dealt with fully in the Canadian Pacific Railway Branch Line Case[7] just decided by this court, this legislation coupled with the Dominion legislation would go far towards answering the question in favour of the Dominion jurisdiction.\nIs it however correct to say that the powers under section 91 are limited in scope to mere regulation?\nThe distribution of legislative power in Canada is substantially provided for by ss. 91 and 92 of the British North America Act. Section 92 deals with the exclusive powers of Provincial Legislatures.\nSection 91 provides\nthat it shall be lawful for the Queen by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the class of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces, and for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms of this section, it is hereby declared that notwithstanding anything in this Act the exclusive legislative authority of Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated;\u2014\nand at the end of the section it is provided:\nAnd any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nThis expression, peace, order and good government, seems to be drawn from the proclamation of the 7th October, 1763, following the Treaty of Paris. That recited:\nWe have thought fit to publish and declare by this our Proclamation that we have in the Letters Patent by which such Governments are constituted given our Governors, etc., power to summon and call General Assemblies.\nThe proclamation then proceeds to confer power on the governors, with the consent of the council and the representatives of the people so to be summoned as aforesaid, to make, constitute and ordain laws, statutes and ordinances for the public peace, welfare and good government of our said colonies and of the people and inhabitants thereof as near as may be agreeable to the laws of England.\nWhen the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada were re-united the imperial statute, 3 & 4 Victoria, chapter 35, (1840,) was enacted providing for the re-union of these two provinces and also for the government of Canada and power was conferred on the Legislative Council and Assembly of Canada to make laws for the peace, welfare and good government of Canada.\nPrior to confederation, in the old provinces of Quebec and in the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, and subsequently, after the re-union, in the Province of Canada, under the powers conferred, hereinbefore referred to, laws were passed relating to railways and other works and it was taken for granted that the powers conferred in the language quoted above conferred the right to legislate in favour of railways and other corporations conferring upon them the power of expropriation in furtherance of the objects of the corporations.\nUnder section 91 of the British North America Act railways connecting the province with any other of the provinces are dealt with and the same statutory powers in regard to expropriation and otherwise have been conferred by the Dominion Parliament without question. In fact it would be impossible to deal with the provisions of section 91 unless it were held that the Dominion Parliament has, incident to the creation of corporations within their jurisdiction, a jurisdiction to pass provisions for expropriation of property, etc., in order to enable them to carry out their corporate objects. This seems to be recognized by the Privy Council in various cases, such as Tennant v. Union Bank[8]; Colonial Building Society v. Attorney General of Quebec[9]; Cushing v. Dupuy[10]; Dobiev. The Temporalities Board[11]; and other cases.\nIt was argued that the Fisheries Case[12]; the Mercer Case[13] and the British Columbia Mines Case[14] compelled the view to be taken that ferries were jura regalia and provincial property.\nIn the Fisheries Case (5), the question arose as to the title to the beds of the waters in question. It was held by the Privy Council that (exclusive of harbours) the bed of the lakes and the bed of the rivers, whether navigable or not, formed part of the lands of the provinces and did not pass to the Dominion. One question there raised was whether under subsec. 12 of sec. 91, which conferred upon the Dominion power to legislate in respect of sea coasts and inland fisheries, the title to the fish in waters owned by the province passed to the Dominion. The point involved in the fisheries case was\u2014conceding the land to be vested in the province\u2014is the property in the fish in the waters covering such lands taken away from the province and vested in the Dominion under the general words used in subsec. 12 of sec. 91? And the Privy Council held that it was not.\nIn the Fisheries Case (5) the question was not merely as affecting the lands covered by waters, the fee of which was in the provinces, but also lands owned by private parties obtained by grants theretofore made to them.\nDealing with the subject the Privy Council determined that in regard to sea coasts and inland fisheries the power conferred upon the Dominion Parliament was merely to regulate but that the property did not vest in them, and that while the Dominion Parliament had exclusive power to make regulations for the control of the fisheries and power to issue licenses to fish on payment of a fee, that did not carry with it a right to grant an exclusive license to fish in the waters belonging to the province or a private individual.\nThe next case urged upon our attention was Attorney General of Ontario v. Mercer[15].\nThat case was merely dealing with the one question \u2014whether under section 109 of The British North America Act escheats of lands belonged to the Crown represented by the Dominion, or the Crown represented by the province. The contention on the part of the Dominion was that the word \"royalties\" must be construed merely in a limited sense as applying to mines and minerals or royalties in the ordinary sense reserved in a grant of mineral rights and that the word royalties should not in any way be applied as referable to lands.\nThe question submitted was whether the Government of Canada or that of Ontario was entitled to lands situate in the Province of Ontario and escheated to the Crown for want of heirs; page 768.\nIn dealing with the case the Lord Chancellor (Earl of Selborne) at page 771 states the question to be determined is whether lands in the Province of Ontario escheated, etc. His Lordship then proceeds to deal with the title to lands and deals with escheats as if it were a species of reversion.\nAt page 774 he states:\nIf there had been nothing in the Act leading to a contrary conclusion their Lordships might have found it difficult to hold that the word \"revenues\" in this section (referring to section 102) did not include territorial as well as other revenues.\nAt page 775 the Lord Chancellor states:\nTheir Lordships for the reasons above stated assume the burden of proving that escheats subsequent to the union are within the sources of revenue excepted and reserved to the provinces, to rest upon the provinces. But if all ordinary territorial revenues arising within the provinces are so excepted and reserved it is not a priori probable that this particular kind of casual territorial revenue (not being expressly provided for) would have been unless by accident and oversight transferred to the Dominion.\nOn page 778 the Lord Chancellor states:\nIt appears however to their Lordships to be a fallacy to assume that because the word \"royalties\" in this context would not be inofficious or insensible, if it were regarded as having reference to mines and minerals, it ought therefore to be limited to those subjects. They see no reason why it should not have its primary and appropriate sense as to (at all events) all the subjects with which it is here found associated\u2014lands as well as mines and minerals. Even as to mines and minerals it here necessarily signifies rights belonging to the Crown jure coron\u0153. The general subject of the whole section is of a high political nature. It is the attribution of royal territorial rights, for purposes of revenue and government, to the provinces in which they are situate or arise.\nOn page 779 the Lord Chancellor says:\nTheir Lordships are not called upon to decide whether the word \"royalties\" in section 109 of the British North America Act of 1867 extends to other royal rights besides those connected with lands, mines and minerals. The question is whether it ought to be restrained to rights connected with mines and minerals only to the exclusion of royalties such as escheats in respect of lands,\nand they were of opinion that under the word \"royalties\" were included all ordinary territorial revenues.\nSubstantially the same views were expressed in the later case of Atty. Gen. of British Columbia v. Atty. Gen. of Canada[16].\nI do not find any court has laid down the rule that a mere right to create something, a mere authority to bring into being a corporate entity or privilege or anything of that character for which a fee could be charged is a \"royalty\" within section 109, but I would rather place such a right under sections 12 and 108 than under 109.\nIt seems to me therefore that the authority to create a ferry of the character in question is vested in the Dominion and exercisable under sections 12 and 91 of the British North America Act.\nThe argument of Mr. Blackstock in favour of the exclusive right of the Provincial Governments to license international and interprovincial ferries was rested entirely upon the enlarged construction he gave to the word royalties in the 109th section of the British North America Act. I have already referred to the construction which ought to be given to this word \"royalties,\" but I would add that if Mr. Black-stock's argument prevailed the practical result would be that the several provinces would determine when and where and to whom and for what consideration international and interprovincial ferries should be granted, and the sole task and power of the Dominion Parliament to legislate on the subject would be confined to the determination of the size of the ferry boats, the proper amount of steam they could use, the number of passengers and life preservers they could and should carry and other like useful if humble powers. I cannot believe that these are the objects which the Imperial Parliament alone had in view when conferring exclusive legislative jurisdiction upon the Dominion Parliament on such an important and imperial question as international ferries.\nI would therefore answer the question submitted:\n1. (a) Yes.\n(b) Covered by first answer.\n2. (a) Yes.\n(b) Yes.\n[1] 12 C. B. N. S. 32; 13 C. B. N. S. 864.\n[2] 9 Can. S. C. R. 1, at p. 11.\n[3] 5 Ont. L.

On behalf of the respondent a motion was made to quash the appeal on the ground that the Supreme Court of Canada had no jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals such as the present where the matter in controversy as disclosed by the demand was less than $2,000, that there was no dispute involved as to the title to the lands, and no future rights were affected.

III., chap. 20, and brought the action against the respondents praying for a declaration that the construction of a new bridge, across the Etchemin River, alleged to be within the limits prohibited by the statute, and opened by them to the free use of the public, was an infringement of the privileges secured to him under the statute, for an order prohibiting further use of the new bridge and for its demolition at the expense of the defendants and for damages. Upon the trial, the Superior Court dismissed the plaintiff's action on the ground that the new bridge was not within the prohibited limits according to the distance measured along the highway. On appeal by the plaintiff, the Court of King's Bench affirmed the judgment dismissing the action, but on the ground that the new bridge was not within the limits reserved according to the distance measured along the course of the river. The principal contention of the plaintiff on the present appeal was that, under the proper construction of the statute, the distance should be measured in a straight horizontal line, and that according to such measurement the new bridge encroached upon the limits specially reserved by his franchise.\nBelleau K.C. for the appellant.\nL. P. Pelletier K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014L'appelant, demandeur en cour de premi\u00e8re instance, est l'ayant cause des concessionnaires d'un pont de p\u00e9age autoris\u00e9 sur la rivi\u00e8re Etchemin par le ch. 20 du statut 58 Geo. III. Il se plaint par son action de ce que les intim\u00e9s ont construit un pont libre sur la dite rivi\u00e8re dans les limites du privil\u00e8ge conc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 ses auteurs par le dit statut, et en demande la d\u00e9molition avec $1,000 de dommages. La clause 6 du statut qui r\u00e9git le litige se lit comme suit: VI.

La cour sup\u00e9rieure a d\u00e9bout\u00e9 son action sur le motif que c'est la distance mesur\u00e9e par le chemin qui r\u00e9git. La cour d'appel a confirm\u00e9 le dispositif de la cour sup\u00e9rieure sur le motif que c'est la distance en suivant le cours de la rivi\u00e8re qui doit pr\u00e9valoir. J'adopte le motif du jugement de la cour d'appel. Le statut ne me laisse pas le moindre doute sur la question. C'est la rivi\u00e8re qui seule doit \u00eatre prise en consid\u00e9ration quand il s'agit d'un tel privil\u00e8ge sur une rivi\u00e8re. Une demie-lieue au-dessus et au-dessous du dit pont veut dire la m\u00eame chose qu'une demie-lieue en amont et une demie-lieue en aval du dit pont. Je d\u00e9bouterais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I concur in the judgment dismissing the appeal for the reasons stated by His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I also concur for the reasons stated by His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nNESBITT J. (dissenting).\u2014The question in this case is: What is the proper construction to be placed upon a statute 58 Geo. III., ch. 20, sec. 6, forbidding the erection of a bridge or use of a ferry within half a league above or below a bridge by the statute authorized. The trial judge held the half league was to be measured by the roads then in use, the Court of King's Bench, that the measurement was to be made by following the middle course of the stream.\nI find the cases well summarized in the 9th volume of the Am. & Eng. Enc. of Law, page 614 as follows:\nDistance is to be measured in a straight line in a horizontal plane unless there is a clear indication that another mode of measurement is to be adopted.\nI have read the various cases referred to and those referred to in the judgment of the court below and adopt the summation I have quoted. Nothing can be added to the historical treatment of the authorities by Lord Blackburn delivering the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber in 1872 in Mouflet v. Cole ([1]), and 1 fail to find any such expression of clear intent on the part of the legislature in this case as to justify a different construction from the one which the court in the case I have referred to lays down as the proper one. I am sensible of the argument that the law was differently declared in 1817, the year before the legislation was enacted, but I cannot overlook the consideration that the law has been authoritatively stated in case after case in England to be different from that laid down by Lord Ellenborough in 1817. Any other construction would in my view leave such room for uncertainty as to be a trap for litigation. I cannot adopt the suggestion of my brother Idington that the court can question the location of the bridge constructed under the statute and used for so many years, and as I have said the true construction of the language used is that a circle of half a mile radius is to be drawn around the bridge and the erection of any other bridge within that radius is prohibited.\nI would allow the appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The cases cited seem to show that the distance from any given point or thing must, unless there is something in the contract or statute inconsistent with such holding, be measured in a straight line. I see nothing in the statute 58 George III., ch. 20, sec 6, inconsistent with the application of that rule to the expression,\nwithin half a league above the said bridge and below the said bridge.\nThe plain ordinary meaning of the words accords with running in a straight line better than any other.\nThere were as far as shown no roads alongside the river when this enactment was passed. Nor is it shewn that the river itself was a navigable stream. That, if shewn, might have made some difference.\nOn the plan produced as an exhibit the river between the two bridges in question is very crooked and for aught we are told it may be from the Byrne bridge up stream absolutely straight. Measurement by the river may mean one thing up the stream and quite another thing down. When we think of the causes and reasons for imposing prohibition here against the construction of another bridge on either side of this toll bridge we see the absurd results that might flow from such interpretation. The bridge was to be\nopposite the Saint Ther\u00e8se road or as near thereto as possible.\nNo doubt this was to serve the people using that road, and there is just as little doubt that when new bridges would be needed they would be likely-intended to serve the people coming by other roads to cross the river. And what roads ? Roads that would serve by running in a general way back from the river to the neighbouring country. It obviously was the intention of the legislature to serve by this bridge a district or territory contributory to it, so to speak, on each side of the river.\nIt was as obviously intended in a general way to prohibit, as a reward to the builders, any new bridge within a half league of the Ste. Ther\u00e8se road or as near thereto as it was possible to build a bridge.\nIt is clear that this bridge was not put opposite or at that road. Why is not explained If it had been shown by evidence that by reason of the conformation of the land it was impracticable to put it nearer thereto than it is, then placing the bridge where it is would be within the statute. Without such evidence or explanation the bridge is not where this statutory franchise authorized it to be. It rested on the appellant to show this, and failing to do so I think he must fail; for rights such as he claims are to be construed most favourably to the public whose rights are restricted by such legislation.\nThe length of time the appellant and his predecessors in title have enjoyed the franchise may enable him to claim the property in the bridge but cannot entitle him to the right of prohibition against rival bridges that the statute gave the original grantees of the franchise, and to measure it from the place where this bridge erroneously placed is found to be. No matter what the interpretation of long ago may have been by somebody the real meaning of the statute is what must govern. The case of Madison v. Emmerson ([2]) exemplifies this. And the Ste. Ther\u00e8se road was declared on the argument here to be more than half a league from the new bridge now in question measured in a straight line and that was not denied.\nAs the cases of Reg. v. The Inhabitants of Saffron Walden ([3]); Jewell v. Stead ([4]); Mouflet v. Cole ([5]), in Exchequer Chambers; Duignan v. Walker ([6]); Stokes v. Grissell ([7]); Lake v. Butler ([8]), followed by Jewell v. Stead (3) which is, being as to a toll-gate on to a turnpike, road, peculiarly applicable here.\nLord Campbell said in this last case that\nunless there is some clear indication in the Act that a different mode of measurement is pointed at, he thought we ought to abide by one general rule of construction.\nIn another case he illustrates the need for this by showing how in case of a tidal river the distance measured by that would vary as in this, no doubt, between low water in summer and high at spring freshet time.\nI am glad to arrive at what I think manifest justice in the case by an adherence to the strict law which must always govern us here.\nI think the appeal should therefore be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Belleau, Belleau & Belleau.\nSolicitors for the respondents : Drouin, Pelletier & Baillargeon.\n[1] L.

Pinsonneault v. H\u00e9bert (13 Can. S.C.R. 450); Gauthier v. Masson (27 Can. S.C.R. 575); Commune de Berthier v. Denis (27 Can. S.C.R. 147); Riou v. Mou (28 Can. S.C.R. 52); Couture v. Couture (34 Can. S.C.R. 716) referred to. Cully v. Ferdais (30 Can. S.C.R. 330 ); The Emerald Phosphate Co. v. The Anglo-Continental Guano Works (21 Can. S.C.R. 422), and Davis v. Roy (33 Can. S.C.R. 345) distinguished.\nMOTION to quash an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe action was brought au possessoire to eject the defendant from the possession of a portion of a lot of land of which the plaintiff alleged that he was owner \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire, for a decretal order that the defendant should deliver up the same in the condition it was before the trespass, for the demolition of a wall constructed thereon by the defendant and for |500 damages. The defence was that the works done by the defendant was done merely to prevent the piece of land in question caving into a drain which the defendant had constructed upon an adjoining lot and that there had been no trespass. By the judgment of the Superior Court the plaintiff's action was maintained, but this decision was reversed on appeal to the Court of King's Bench by the judgment now appealed from.\nBelcourt K.C. for the motion. The action is really one for trespass and claiming $500 damages. It does not even ask for homage; at the most it can be regarded simply as a possessory action and there is no question as to the title to land involved. This case is in all respects similar to The Emerald Phosphate Go. v. The Anglo-Continental Guano Works ([1]). We also refer to Gully v. Fer dais ([2]), and Davis v. Roy ([3]).\nStuart K.C. contra. The action depends upon our possession \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire and involves the question whether or not the defendant has any right to enter upon the land in question and construct works thereon. It also effects future rights as between the parties. We rely upon the decisions of this court in Blatchford v. McBain([4]); McGoey v. Leamy([5]); Gauthier v. Masson([6]); Delorme v. Cusson([7]); and Parent v. The Quebec North Shore Turnpike Road Trustees ([8]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGIROUARD J.\u2014This is a motion to quash an appeal from a judgment rendered in a possessory action. Our uniform jurisprudence has been to entertain such an appeal in numerous cases and seldom, if ever, has our jurisdiction been questioned. The reason is that possessory actions always involve in a secondary manner the title to lands, for the plaintiff must possess animo domini, \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire, and the defendant may plead, as the respondent did in this instance, that he is not such a proprietor. See Pinsonnault v. H\u00e9bert ([9]); Gauthier v. Masson([10]); Commune de Berthier v. Denis([11]); Biou v. Biou([12]); Couture v. Couture([13]).\nIn Cully v. Ferdais([14]), Taschereau J. lays down the rule that an action confessoire, like actions n\u00e9gatoires, is appealable; the appeal was quashed because the action was not one of those actions.\nMr. Belcourt has referred us to The Emerald Phosphate Co. v. The Anglo-Continental Guano Works([15]). But I fail to see how he can find any comfort in that decision. First, it was not a case of possessory action, but one of injunction which is always purely personal. The last remarks of Taschereau J. are conclusive upon the point before us:\nNow, under the laws of the province the rights to the title of this lot, or the possession thereof, could not be determined on such a proceeding taken ab initio. No judgment au possessoire or au p\u00e9titoire could be given thereon.\nThe case of Davis v. Roy([16]) does not apply, for there the question at issue before this court was not the possessory action, but the personal condemnation for $200 for rent.\nThe motion is rejected with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : B\u00e9dard & Chalout.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Drouin, Pelletier & Baillargeon.\n[1] 21 Can.

A few days later he conveyed a block of land to M. in fee \"saving and excepting\" thereout six acres for the life of the grantor's father and sisters or that of the survivor, or until the marriage of the sisters, on the happening of said respective events the six acres to be and remain the property of M., his heirs and assigns under said deed. Three months later M. conveyed the block of land to R. M. in fee, and when the life estate terminated in 1903 the latter brought ejectment against the heirs of the life tenants who claimed the six acres on the ground that the deed to M. contained no grant of the same and also because the life tenant had had adverse possession for more than twenty years.\nHeld, that as the evidence shewed that the life tenants went into possession under R. M. the title of the latter could not be disputed and the statute would not begin to run until the life estate terminated.\nHeld per Idington J. that R. M. under his deed and that to his grantor had the reversion to the fee in the six acres after the life estate terminated.\nThe lease of the life estate was given to R. M. with the other title deeds on conveyance of the land to him and on the trial it was received in evidence as an ancient document relating to the title and coming from proper custody. It was not executed by the lessees and no counterpart was proved to be in existence.\nHeld, that it was properly admitted in evidence.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island maintaining the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff. The facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note and are fully set forth in the judgments given on this appeal.\nMcLeod K.C. and Duvernet for the appellant, John Dods.\nMorson K.C. for the appellant, Hannah Dods.\nA. A. McLean K.C. and Mathieson for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given by my brother Davies.\nGIROUARD J. concurred with Davies J.\nDavies J.\u2014This was an action of ejectment brought by the respondent McDonald to recover possession from the appellants of six acres of land part of a farm of fifty acres which in the year 1854 he had purchased from one Mutch. Mutch had in the previous year purchased the farm from one Thomas Dods. In the judgment of the Court appealed from, the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, Mr. Justice Fitzgerald, who delivered the judgment of the majority and who had also been the trial judge, states the facts very fully. Amongst other facts he finds that Thomas Dods from whom Mutch purchased was in 1853, the time of the purchase, admittedly the sole owner in fee simple in possession of the farm including the locus.\nThe defendants in their factum on this appeal concede this. In the deed from Thomas Dods to Mutch and also in that from Mutch to McDonald the plaintiff conveying the fifty acre farm, there was a clause about which much dispute arose: it reads as follows:\nSaving and excepting out of the first mentioned tract of fifty acres, six acres thereof described as follows, namely, (here follows descrip- tion) for and during the natural life of Robert Dods of Cherry Valley aforesaid, and also during the natural lives of his two daughters Jane and Elizabeth Dods, or until the death of the longest liver of them, or until the marriages of the said Jane and Elizabeth Dods whichever event shall first happen, the said six acres of land being hereby reserved for the use of the said Robert Dods during his life, and of the said Jane Dods and Elizabeth Dods until the death of the survivor of them or until their marriages aforesaid. It being understood that upon the happening of the said respective events, the said six acres of land shall be and remain the property of the said Robert Mutch his heirs and assigns under this deed.\nThe defendants (appellants) contend first that the true construction of the clause was that the six acres were excepted out of the deed altogether and never passed to Mutch or McDonald at all. Secondly, that as Robert Dods and Jane and Elizabeth Dods in whose favour a life estate or interest was ostensibly being created were none of them parties to these deeds, under the law which existed in Prince Edward Island at the time of the execution of the deed no estate did or could pass to them under it. Thirdly, that the Dods, Robert, Jane and Elizabeth, under whom the defendants claimed were not put into possession and did not accept possession from the plaintiff either under the alleged lease from Thomas Dods to them or under the reservation in the deed; and, lastly, that the statute of limitation began to run one year after they went into possession they being really tenants at will of the plaintiff. Questions were also raised about the effect of the Registration Act which, in the view I take of the facts and the law, become unimportant\nThe lease above referred to was a document in the form of a lease made between Thomas Dods, the then owner in fee, and his father Robert Dods and his sisters Jane and Elizabeth a few days before the sale and execution of the deed to Mutch by the lessor, whereby the lessor professed to grant to the lessees an estate for their joint lives and the survivor of them reserving a rent of two pence an acre to the lessor. The reservation in the deed was attempted to be explained as having reference to this lease and the estate or term thereby created through it made no reference to the nominal rent reserved by the lease and I am inclined personally to think that, in view of the proved facts, there is very much in the contention. It was however strenuously contended on the other hand that the language of the reservation in referring to the estate \"thereby created\" was not consistent with its having reference to the lease.\nThe parties referred to in the lease and in the reservation of the deed as the tenants for life, Robert, Jane and Elizabeth Dods, resided with Robert's son Thomas Dods the owner of the fee on the farm at the time of the execution of the deed of conveyance to Mutch and also of that to plaintiff McDonald.\nThey claimed no title of any kind living there with Thomas simply as members of the family.\nThe plaintiff produced as part of his evidence the old lease and proved that it had been handed over to him with the title deeds when he got his conveyance from Mutch to whom it had been handed by Thomas Dods when he sold to Mutch\nIt was signed and sealed by Thomas and his wife and properly witnessed but was not executed by the grantees or lessees, and as no counterpart could be found or was positively found to have existed its production as evidence was strongly resisted.\nIt was however admitted in evidence by the trial judge as an ancient document relating to the title and coming from a proper custody aiter the expiration of the term it purported to create.\nThe evidence shewed and the trial judge held that Mutch had, on getting his deed, entered into possession of the farm, done some work upon it and assisted his grantor Thomas in moving from one part of the farm to the locus in quo, a dwelling house for his father and sisters to reside in; that he was in possession at the time he sold and conveyed to McDonald, and that the latter had put Robert, Jane and Elizabeth Dods into possession of this house and the six acres under the lease to them for their lives after he purchased the farm and that they had accepted such possession from him under this lease.\nThere was much controversy as to this latter important fact but after carefully reading all the evidence over I am satisfied there is no sufficient ground to reverse either the ruling as to the admission of this lease or the fact found as to Robert, Jane and Elizabeth Dods accepting possession under it from the plaintiff McDonald. I fully concur in all other findings of fact of the trial judge.\nThis evidence being admitted proving the lease and supported by the finding of fact as to the acceptance of the possession under the lease by the tenants for life the plaintiff submitted that he had made out a prim\u00e2 facie case at least, and that defendants not having controverted the acceptance of possession as proved, and having put in evidence their title both by will and deed which showed them to claim as devisees and grantees of the life tenants, Robert, Jane and Elizabeth Dods, they were estopped from denying the title of the person from whom these parties through whom they claimed had received the possession or the term or estate for which possession had been given them until they had first on the expiration of the term given up the possession to the person at whose hands they received it.\nThe original lessees, it is contended, could not deny plaintiff's title to give them the estate and possession they had accepted and the defendants claiming under them were equally estopped. The case revolves largely around the determination of the question as to how the Dods were put into and accepted possession. Once evidence was given, as I think was properly found by the trial judge and the court below, in this case sustaining the finding that possession was given and accepted under the lease for the lives of the tenants, then most of the legal difficulties vanish. No statutory title by possession has or could be gained by defendants because the plaintiff's right of entry did not arise until the death of the survivor of the life tenants and the twenty years did not until then begin to run. The wholesome doctrine of estoppel applies to prevent parties who accept possession of lands under a certain title from disputing the title under which they accepted possession. If the defendants in this case had not claimed title under the tenants for life much might have been said as to their right to rely solely upon the plaintiff proving a good title in himself, but the doctrine of estoppel which they have invited by their proofs of title through the plaintiffs tenants prevents them raising any question of latent defects in plaintiff's title.\nThe case of Board v. Board ([1]) was called to the attention of the counsel for the appellants and they were asked to distinguish this case in appeal from the principles governing that decision.\nIf the Dods accepted possession as found under the lease they and those claiming under them were estopped from denying McDonald's title to give the lease. If, on the other hand, they accepted the possession under the reservation in McDonald's deed they would under the authority cited seem to be similarly estopped. The learned counsel for the appellants appreciated the difficulties they were in if that case of Board v. Board ([2]) could not be distinguished. They called attention to some observations of Jessell M. R. upon the case in In re Stringer's Estate ([3]), at pages 9 to 11. That learned Master of the Rolls does not however question the authority of the case of Board v. Board ([4]) but rather confirms it.\nHowever, accepting as I do the findings of the learned trial judge I have no difficulty whatever, under the authorities and on principle, in upholding the verdict and think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nNesbitt J. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondent McDonald brought an action of ejectment against the appellants to recover six acres of land in Prince Edward Island. The judgment being given in favour of the respondent for recovery of the said land and that judgment having been upheld on appeal to the Supreme Court of that province the appellants seek to reverse such judgment. They claim title by virtue of the Statute of Limitations, and the first question suggested is: When did the time begin to run? When did the right of entry of the respondent first accrue?\nIn one way of looking at the matter the answer to this must depend on the effect to be given to the deed of 31st October, 1853, by which Thos. Dods who was in possession, and his wife, purported to grant to Robert Dods the father, and Jane Dods and Elizabeth Dods the sisters, of Thos. Dods, the lands in question for the \" term and time of the natural lives\" of the grantees.\nAs this deed followed to some extent the form of a lease with apt words for demising and leasing as well as granting in the operative part and also for render- ing to the grantor a nominal yearly rental of two pence per acre, I will refer to it as the lease. A few days later the grantor conveyed by deed of grant, by way of or purporting to be by way of release made in pursuance of an Act of the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island made and passed in the twelfth year of Her Majesty Queen Victoria intituled\nan Act for rendering a release as effectual for the conveyance of Freehold Estates as a lease and release by the same parties,\nto one Mutch who within about three months later by a similar deed conveyed to the plaintiff two parcels of land therein described.\nFollowing that description and as a continuous part of the same sentence in each deed were added the following:\nSaving and excepting out of the said first mentioned tract of fifty acres, six acres thereof described as follows, namely, fronting on the said road leading to. Cherry Valley and extending from the land of the said Alexander McNeill to land in the occupation of Thomas Wright and from the said road back a sufficient distance by a line parallel with the said road to make or include the said quantity of six acres for and during the natural life of Robert Dods of Cherry Valley aforesaid and also during the natural lives of his two daughters Jane and Elizabeth Dods and until the death of the longest liver of them or until the marriages of the said Jane and Elizabeth Dods whichever event shall first happen the said six acres of land being hereby reserved for the use of the said Robert Dods during his life and of the said Jane Dods and Elizabeth Dods until the death of the survivor of them or until their marriages aforesaid.\nAnd then the next sentence in the deed to Mutch is as follows:\nIt being understood that upon the happening of the said respective, events the said six acres of land shall be and remain the property of the said Robert Mutch, his heirs and assigns under this deed together with all woods, underwoods, ways, waters, watercourses, houses, outhouses, yards, buildings, stables, gardens, fences, profits, commodities, privileges and advantages whatsoever to the said land, hereditaments and premises belonging or in any wise appertaining or therewith usually held, used, occupied, possessed, enjoyed, reputed, taken or known as part, parcel or member thereof or of any part thereof, and the reversion and reversions, remainder and remainders, rents, issues and profits thereof, and of every part thereof, and all the estate, right, title, trust, interest, property, claim and demand whatsoever, both at law and in equity of them the said Thomas Dods and Jessie, his wife, of, in, to or out of the said lands hereditaments and premises, or any part thereof, to have and to hold the said lands, hereditaments and premises hereby granted and released or intended so to be with their and every of their rights, members and appurtenances unto the said Robert Mutch, his heirs and assigns, to the use of the said Robert Mutch, his heirs and assigns for ever.\nThe same words were adopted in the deed from Mutch to McDonald save as to the name of the grantee.\nIt is urged that these deeds must be read as if there merely had been an exception from the lands described and that therefore there was no grant of the reversion or remainder.\nI am with due respect unable to understand how these documents can be read as containing or having been intended to contain or express any such meaning or any other meaning than an exception of the life estate merely. If that be, as I think, the correct construction then these deeds operate by way of a grant of the reversion.\nThat gave McDonald a right of entry only on the determination of the prior estate of freehold created by the lease and that happened on the death of the survivor Elizabeth Dods in March, 1903.\nIt is stoutly urged, however, that there never was in fact and in law any such freehold estate as this I am assuming was excepted from the conveyances in question and upon which there: could be a reversion and grant thereof. The document though not well drawn clearly would have operated if executed by the lessor or grantor and assented to by the grantees so as to create an estate of freehold as above described.\nThis document was given by Mutch to the respondent along with the other deeds already referred to at the time of respondent's purchase of the lands conveyed by those other deeds and it appears clear beyond any doubt that it was not only so delivered but was brought into existence at or about the time it bears date.\nNo proof is given of its execution except such as may be presumed in law from its having been produced from proper custody and being such an ancient document.\nWas Mr. McDonald the proper custodian of such a deed?\nIt was a grant to the tenants of the freehold. One would possibly look for such a document in. the possession of the grantees rather than in that of the grantor or assignee of the grantor.\nOne might even look in the registry office as the better place for its safe keeping and safe-guarding the interests of all concerned.\nIt contained covenants by the grantees with the grantor. For the purposes of these covenants and to secure the grantor and his assigns their due performance he and his heirs and assigns might reasonably claim custody of the document.\nIn the case of the very events that have happened the existence of this deed as to the six acres was as valuable a muniment of title as any other. The respondent was, therefore, I think within the authorities such a proper legal custodian of this deed as to render it admissible as an ancient document. See Plaxton v. Dare ([5]); Bishop of Meath v. Marquess of Winchester ([6]); Croughton v. Blake ([7]); Doe d. Neale v. Samples ([8]); Doe d. Jacobs v. Phillips ([9]); Slater v. Hodgson ([10]); Earl of Miltown v Goodman ([11]).\nBeing produced from a proper custody though not what one might think probable, or most proper, as expressed by Baron Parke, in Croughton v. Blake ([12]), is all that is necessary. And when so produced it is admissible and to be taken as proving itself.\nIt is said however that its condition on production shows an execution only by the grantors. There are seals where one would expect for the grantees, but no signatures by them.\nThe attestation clause puts it as if it had been signed as well as sealed by the parties and that is subscribed by a witness, Charles Stewart.\nWhat in law should be presumed from this?\nAre we to assume that there was a complete execution by all the parties. The seals without the signatures of the grantees might be taken to be their execution. It would be a good execution. It may be doubtful, however, if without more it would be safe to say that this should be presumed especially as it is said that\nin a case of documents of title, however, acts of possession thereunder should be shewn, though the absence of such evidence goes merely to weight and not to admissibility.\nSee Phipson on Evidence (3 ed.) p. 468.\nIt is a fair and reasonable inference, I think, from all that I have referred to and the fact that the document was duly handed to McDonald by Mutch with other deeds, that Mutch got it as a completed document and that it was intended by his grantor Thomas Dods to operate without further execution or signature by the grantees. If that be the case then did these grantees assent to the proffered estate of freehold vesting in them?\nWithout their acceptance the grant could not operate. Upon this point the evidence of the respondent is conclusive if believed.\nHe says that when he purchased the grantees or lessees in this lease lived on the property he was purchasing and desired immediate possession of, and were reluctant to move over on to the six acres but were finally persuaded to do so. In relation to that part of the negotiation his evidence is as follows:\nQ. Who was it built the house on the six acre lot?\nA. Thomas Dods.\nQ. Was that before or after you had bought the place?\nA. I think it was before I had bought it; between the time that Mutch bought it and I bought it from Mutch.\nQ. While the Dods were in your house\u2014in the house on the homestead \u2014did you have any conversation with them about moving on the six acres?\nA. Well, I spoke to them several times for to move to their own six acres that were reserved for them for their lifetime for their house. * *\nQ. Did you ever have any conversation with Robert, Elizabeth or Jane Dods about the lease?\nA. When they went into posession I told them how they had to go into their own place that they held under their lease or agreement for their lifetime. * * *\nQ. And they accordingly went into possession of the six acres?\nA. They went in, Mr. Beers and I put them in possession. * *\nQ. Thomas's two sisters. Was there anything said about a lease between you people?\nA. There was.\nQ. Tell what it was?\nA. I told them more than once or twice that how the lease was all their lifetime of this place, and whenever they would die\u2014the last of them\u2014 that how I expected the property to fall into my hands.\nBy Mr. Mathieson:\nQ. That is the six acres?\nA. The six acres.\nQ. Where were they at the time you had this conversation, on the homestead?\nA. I told them of it in their own house.\nQ. That is on the six acres?\nA. That is on the six acres.\nQ. Did you ever have any conversation of a similar kind with them on the homestead while they were living in the house there?\nA. Yes; that how they had their life interest in the place, and that is all they had.\nQ. And you employed Mr. Beers to help you to get them out of the premises?\nA. Yes sir, in a peaceable way.\nQ. On account of the conversation that you had with them about the lease, did they do anything? A. Well no; they didn't do anything, but they admitted that how the lease was a writing unjust one\u2014that they only had their life out of it.\nQ. They didn't do anything about that conversation?\nA. Well the conversation was\u2014that it was as much that they admitted.\nQ. What was the object of this conversation with them\u2014what did you wish them to do?\nA. I wished them to go out of the homestead and go to there own house.\nQ. Did they do that?\nA. They did.\nThe learned trial judge implicitly relied upon this and in reading the whole evidence I see no reason why I should disregard his finding.\nThis evidence can, taken literally, only, I think, have one meaning and that is that the grantees had after due consideration decided to accept the grant tendered them by this deed.\nIf so they are bound thereby.\nThe case is thus rendered a very simple one of an estate of freehold that has terminated recently and the respondent as the assignee of the reversion is entitled to eject the appellants who have no longer any rights in the premises and are wrongfully in possession thereof.\nIt is said, however, by the appellants that there was no grant or conveyance of the reversion.\nThe evidence shews that the parties met either in relation to the reservation in the deed or the lease and that the plaintiff gave the tenants for life possession of the property.\nThat brings up the consideration of the title of the respondent and his right to assert claim to the reversion and the right to possession by virtue thereof, upon the determination of the freehold estate.\nHe must on the facts be presumed to have been in possession when he put the tenants for life there.\nThe presumption from his possession then would be that of his being then owner of the fee and until such presumption has been expressly rebutted continues and he is now at liberty to assert it.\nThere are many other considerations of weight in this case that would or might bring about the same result.\nWhilst wholly dissenting from, as already indicated, the view that the saving and excepting clauses in the deeds should be cut in two in the middle of a sentence as we have been asked to do, to give an effect to them, I am not unmindful of the authorities indicating that there cannot be an exception of an estate for life or a reservation thereof.\nIf that be a proper view to take here then the whole excepting clause is void as repugnant to the grant and the deed of conveyance to respondent operated so as to transfer the fee simple from Mutch to McDonald as that had been by similar deed transferred from Thomas Dods to Mutch.\nAnd McDonald is entitled to claim thereunder and now to enter upon the determination of the life estate he had given Robert Dods and his daughters.\nIn this way we would be rid of what has occurred to me throughout this case was a difficulty in the way of giving effect to these deeds in the two-fold way of operating to vest a present estate and also by way of grant to transfer the reversion or remainder.\nThe way in which that troubled me was not raised in argument and therefore possibly the difficulty does not exist.\nThere is another view presented by the suggestion that the covenant to stand seized, in this deed, may, though with a stranger, have enured in the light of the declared intentions to the benefit of the tenants for life See Thorne v. Thorne ([13]), approved in Doe d. Lewis v. Davies ([14])\nI am not so impressed, in view of the particular wording of those deeds, as to dwell upon this, but would refer to the cases of Hartman v. Fleming ([15]), and Wilson v. Gilmer ([16]), in each of which very eminent authority relied upon the covenant to stand seized, in a way that might operate here, if necessary, and may be well worthy of consideration here and may possibly be relied upon to support respondent's case.\nI think that in order to give effect to the obvious intentions of the parties to these deeds it can be done and that with due regard to the ancient principles of real property law.\nThe case of Board v. Board ([17]) if accepted in its entirety, as good law, might well be held to govern our decision here. But there is an obvious distinction drawn by Jessel M. R. in In re Stringer's Estate; Shaw v. Jones-Forde ([18]), at pages 9 et seq. that may be applicable here.\nThough the appellants made claim through the tenants for life here as in Board v. Board ([19]), yet in the case of one of them, Hannah Dods, at all events, the right thus acquired did not accrue till after the determination of the estate for life.\nAnd she may be said to have the right to assert her possessory title quite independently of the devise to her by Elizabeth Dods, and put the respondent, as plaintiff, to rest upon the strength of his own title and proof thereof.\nIt is to be observed that this distinction made by Jessel M. R., though possibly open to the defendant in Board v. Board ([xx]) was not made in argument of that case and may have been overlooked.\nI prefer to hold that the lease created an estate of freehold and that the acceptance of that as testified by the respondent related back to the execution of the lease and that the later deeds vested title, in either of the ways indicated, to the reversion thus created in the respondent and that he is entitled now to succeed by virtue thereof.\nI am equally satisfied to hold that his possession when he put the tenants for life as such in possession must be held presumptive of his ownership of the fee entitling him to succeed on the termination of the lease.\nIn either of these events he is entitled to succeed.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant, John Dods: D.

R. 424) referred to.\nMOTION to quash an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of M. Justice Davidson in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, by which the appellants petition for a writ of prohibition was dismissed with costs.\nThe case is stated in the judgment of the court delivered by His Lordship M. Justice Sedgewick.\nMacmaster K. C. and Stuart K. C. for the motion. T. Chase Casgrain K. C. and Alexander Tascherean K. C. contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The fact so far as they relate to the present application are shortly as follows:\nThe appellants are alleged to be fugitives from the justice of the United States of America and having come to Canada a warrant was issued for their arrest by Mr. Ulric Lafontaine, an Extradition Commissioner appointed under the Extradition Act of Canada, who thereupon began proceedings for the purpose of ascertaining whether a prim\u00e2 facie case would be made out as to the commission of an extraditable offence by them.\nDuring the pendency of these proceedings application was made to the Hon. Mr. Justice Davidson, a Judge of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, for a writ prohibiting the Extradition Commissioner from proceeding with the investigation. That learned judge refused the application and from his judgment there was an appeal to the Court of King's Bench resulting in the confirmation of Mr. Justice Davidson's judgment.\nAn appeal having been asserted to this court from the judgment of the appellate tribunal the respondents have made a motion to quash that appeal upon the ground that this court has no jurisdiction to entertain it. Whether it lies within our province to hear the appeal on its merits depends upon the construction to be given to sec. 24 (g) of the Supreme & Exchequer Courts Act as amended by 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 25 sec. 2. The amended section is as follows:\nAn appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from the judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, cartiorari or prohibition not arising out of a criminal charge. And in aid to its proper construction sec. 31 of the Act may be quoted:\nNo appeal shall be allowed in any proceeding for or upon a writ of habeas corpus arising out of any claim for extradition made under any treaty.\nWe are all of opinion that we have no jurisdiction, inasmuch as, in our view, the proceedings and judgment which are now sought to be brought before this court for the purposes of appeal do arise out of a criminal charge, and therefore the judgment complained of is not a judgment appealable to this court.\nOne or two considerations lead, we think, inevitably to this conclusion. It would appear from the perusal of the criminal law of Canada and of cognate legislation that the whole policy of Parliament has been to prevent prolonged litigation particularly in matters of a criminal nature. For example, the Parliament of Canada after much controversy and discussion with the imperial authority passed an Act abolishing appeals in criminal matters to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Subsection (g), above cited, gives evidence of the same policy by preventing an appeal in certain specified cases which arise out of a criminal charge; and sec. 31, above quoted, makes it clear that in extradition matters there should be no appeal to this court upon a writ of habeas corpus arising out of any claim for extradition made under any treaty. These considerations afford ground for the contention that, apart altogether from the express words of sec. 24 (g), it was certainly the intention of Parliament to limit in every possible way appeals of the character now before us. But looking more particularly at section 24 (g), it assumes that proceedings for a writ of prohibition may arise either out of a civil matter or out of a criminal charge. If the meaning contended for by the appellants is the true one then those words \" certiorari and prohibition\" added by the Act, 54 & 55 Vict. c. 25, sec. 2, are absolutely meaningless.\nIf these proceedings now before us are civil proceedings within the meaning of sec. 24 (g), then it is impossible to conceive of a writ of prohibition which can arise out of a criminal charge. This, it seems to us, demonstrates the fallacy of the appellants' contention. But apart from that it is indisputable that the charge made before the Extradition Commissioner was a criminal charge. So too, the warrant issued was a proceeding arising out of that charge. A motion made in court to prevent a magistrate from proceeding to investigate that charge is a motion to stop the further proceedings of the investigation of that criminal charge and it, therefore, necessarily follows, in construing the statute according to the canons requiring a literal construction, that the case before us is a case arising out of a criminal charge. Reference may be had to the following cases in support of this opinion; Ex parte Woodhall ([1]); Hunt v. United States ([2]).\nThe appeal is quashed with costs.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nPetition for leave to appeal to the Privy Council abandoned and petition dismissed, 26th July, 1905.\nSolicitor for the appellants : Fitzpatrick, Parent, Taschereau, Roy & Cannon.\nSolicitor for the respondent : Macmaster & Hickson.\n[1] 20 Q.

In the present case the defendant, having failed to plead such defence, was allowed to amend on terms, the Chief Justice dissenting. APPEAL from the judgment of the Territorial Court of Yukon Territory in banco, reversing the judgment of Dugas J. at the trial, and ordering that the transfer of certain lands should be set aside as being fraudulent and void as against the respondent and all other creditors of one Edward McConnell, and declaring that the title of the appellants was held subject to the creditors' claims.\nThe plaintiff (McGrade) was holder in due course, after maturity, of two promissory notes made by one Edward McConnell upon which he had brought a former action, on 9th Sept., 1901, and recovered judgment. One of the notes, dated 26th Aug., 1899, had fallen due on 1st July, 1900, and the other was dated 15th Sept., 1899, and payable on demand. The plaintiff also brought the present action, on behalf of all McConnell's creditors, on 2nd Oct., 1901, to set aside a transfer of the lands now in question made by McConnell to his wife on 7th April, 1900, as being void and fraudulent as against creditors. These lands were subject to the operation of the \"Land Titles Act, 1894,\" and on 2nd Oct., 1901, a certificate of lis pendens was issued in the latter action and notice thereof was filed in the office of the Yukon Land Registration District, whereupon the registrar indorsed a memorandum thereof upon the folio of the register constituting the certificate of title as an incumbrance or charge upon the lands. Upon the 21st of June, 1902, the registered owner, Mrs. McConnell, while the action was pending, transferred the lands to the syndicate, appellants, and a new certificate of title was issued to them with a notification thereon that the title was subject to the lis pendens.\nThe appellants were made parties (defendants) to the second action and an amendment allowed by which the transfer was alleged, and it was further charged that the \"Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke is not a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser for value without notice, but took the conveyance from the said Luella Day McConnell with full knowledge and notice of all the facts pleaded herein; \"and further relief was claimed for a declaration that the said conveyance should be declared fraudulent and void as against the plaintiffs and that the conveyance to the syndicate be declared to be subject to the claims of the plaintiff and all the other creditors of Edward McConnell; that the said Luella Day McConnell and the syndicate should be declared trustees of the land for McGrade and all the other creditors, and that, for that purpose, all proper directions should be given and accounts taken and for such further relief as the circumstances of the case may require.\nOn the 31st of March, 1902, the defendant Edward McConnell filed his defence denying any indebtedness to the plaintiffs, alleging that before maturity of the first note his liability thereon was absolutely and unconditionally renounced by the person who was then the holder thereof and that, at the time of the indorsement to him, the plaintiff had notice of such renunciation, and also that the second note had been satisfied and discharged by payment before the action was brought. The defence further alleged \"that at the respective dates of said conveyances the plaintiff was not, and that he is not now. a creditor of the said defendant, and that there were not at the said dates any creditors of the said defendant whose claims, if any, had not been satisfied and discharged before this action was commenced; and that any of the present creditors of the said defendant, if there are any, which he denies, became such creditors with full notice that the said conveyances had been made and that the said lots were the property of the other defendant, Luella Day McConnell.\" He also denied that the conveyances were made with the intent and design alleged, and insisted that they were bon\u00e2 fide and for valuable consideration.\nThe other defendant, Luella Day McConnell, pleaded separately and by her statement of defence denied that she became a party to the conveyances with the design or intention of aiding or assisting the said Edward McConnell to defeat, delay or hinder the plaintiffs or other creditors in recovering their debts, alleged valuable consideration, absence of notice of any such intention or design on the part of the said Edward McConnell and of any indebtedness of the latter to the plaintiffs or to any other persons, that her title to the said land (a grant from the Crown) did not depend upon but was independent of the conveyances, that, at the time that the conveyances were made, the plaintiff, McGrade was not a creditor of the defendant Edward McConnell and there were no creditors of the said defendant and that there were none at the time the second action was instituted, that her Crown grant and certificate of title were obtained solely by her, paid for by her, and that she derived title to the said land by virtue of the Crown grant and certificate of title.\nThe plaintiffs joined issue on these defendants' statements of defence\nThe syndicate by their statement of defence deny that they are not a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser for value without notice, and they further deny that they took the conveyance with full knowledge or any knowledge or notice of the facts set out in the statement of claim, and they claim to be bon\u00e2 fide purchasers of the land for value, without notice. In the alternative they allege that any lis pendens issued was so issued without authority of law, and that the lis pendens and the registration thereof were unauthorized, void and of no effect as against them, and that they are not charged with notice by reason of notice of action, and that the lands purchased by them were not subject to any claims whatsoever of the plaintiffs by reason of said lis pendens or otherwise, and the said statement of claim shews no cause of action against them, because there was no cause of action whereof to charge them with notice or to form any lien upon the lands purchased by them.\nAt the trial, Mr. Justice Dugas was of the opinion that the promissory notes, having been transferred by simple indorsement after maturity, and subsequent to (the alleged fraudulent transfer, the plaintiff, McGrade, has no right or status to bring the action to set aside the conveyances, or to obtain the relief sought on behalf of himself and creditors.\nThe learned trial judge, however, held that the evidence established that the transfers from McConnell to his wife were made with the object of defrauding the creditors; also that the law and practice of the Yukon Territory did not authorize the filing of a notice of lis pendens, because lands in the Yukon were entirely within the \"Land Titles' Act, 1894\" and its amendments which did not so provide but made provision (sec. 99. for the lodging of a caveat; that a purchaser for valuable consideration, but with notice, was subject to have his contract voided, and that, notwithstanding registration of the conveyance to the purchaser, the equitable doctrine of notice would always stand; nevertheless, that notice having reached the syndicate through a defective or irregular document, viz.: the notice of lis pendens filed, it was not an effectual notice and could not bind the parties. He accordingly dismissed the action with costs in favour of the syndicate.\nOn appeal Mr. Justice Dugas adhered to his judgment at the trial; but Mr. Justice Craig and Mr. Justice MacAulay were of opinion that the plaintiffs should succeed. Judgment was given accordingly for the plaintiff with costs, the impeached transfers were declared void as against the creditors, and the title of the syndicate was declared to be subject to the claims of the creditors, with a direction that the lands should be sold to satisfy the claims.\nFrom this latter judgment the present appeal is taken by the syndicate.\nChrysler K. C. for the appellants. It is not claimed that either the patents to Mrs. McConnell should be set aside or that the deed from her and the certificate of title to the syndicate are fradulent against the plaintiffs, but, consenting that these instruments should stand intact, they ask that the title to the syndicate be declared subject to the credi-tors' claims; and that the syndicate may be declared trustees for all the creditors of Edward McConnell. It is not denied that the deed to the syndicate was given for valuable consideration. The claim is that the deed to Mrs. McConnell is voidable or void under the statute respecting fraudulent conveyances and that the judgment setting aside the deed to her should be binding upon the syndicate as purchasers, pendente lite, because they had notice of lis pendens through the medium of the indorsement upon their own certificate of title. It is not alleged that the syndicate had otherwise notice of the claim or that they knew, as a fact, that the deed from McConnell to his wife was made for the purpose of defrauding his creditors nor that they were otherwise parties to the alleged fraudulent dealing between McConnell and his wife. It is conceeded that the purchase by the syndicate was for valuable consideration and in good faith, unless it be bad faith to purchase, pendente lite, in the face of an invalid registration notified upon the certificate of title and without knowledge of the alleged fraud. The syndicate relied entirely upon the clear certificate of title held by the registered owner of the land in respect of which they were dealing with her. \"Land Titles Act, 1894,\" sec. 126. Hardcastle on Statutes, (3 ed.) at page 333 suggests that in the case of an Act which grants a new jurisdiction, a new procedure, new remedies, the procedure, forms or remedies there pre-scribed and no others must be followed until altered by subsequent legislation. This principle seems applicable to \"The Land Titles Act\" and the procedure for filing a \"caveat\" This procedure cannot be set aside and an irregular document called \"Notice of lis pendens\" filed, which is not provided for either by \"The Land Titles Act\" or by \"The Judicature Act\" in force in the Territories.\nEven assuming that the filing of the lis pendens had some effect as notice, what would the syndicate have learned if they, had looked into the allegations in this suit? Merely that the transfer by McConnell to his wife was alleged to be a fraud upon the creditors; that the said deed was sought to be set aside and Mrs. McConnell declared trustee for the creditors; that, subsequent to the transfer to Mrs. McConnell, a patent had been granted to her by the Crown and that, thereupon, a certificate of title had issued to her under \" The Land Titles Act.\" No attack was made on the patent, nor that it was in any' way connected with the alleged fraudulent transfer or issued to her because or on the strength of said alleged fraudulent transfer, nor was any attack made on the certificate of title issued to her. Mrs. McConnell set up in her answer that her title was not dependent on the transfer to her by her husband, but as the patent and certificate of title were in no way impugned under sections 55, 57 and 126, \"Land Titles Act\" there was still a clear title in Mrs. McConnell which left her free power of disposi- tion as owner and the syndicate was safe in carrying out the purchase.\nEven if the lis pendens was called a caveat and treated as if filed as such, it could not affect the title; a caveat that does not comply with the Act is of no avail. McKay v. Nanton ([1]), and cases there cited; McArthur v. Glass ([2]). Registration of a document improperly registered is not notice; Atkins v. Coy ([3]); Roff r. Krecker ([4]). Notice of a prior mortgage unrecorded at the time of registering a second mortgage does not postpone the second mortgage; Edwards v. Edwards ([5]). Mere notice of prior unregistered documents is of no avail as against a registered document, and the holder of a registered title is a purchaser for value not with standing notice of such prior documents. Void documents have no force in law, and, as the lis pendens in this case was void, it could not be notice. Claims for which the statute has not provided the means of filing a caveat cannot be relied upon as against a registered owner who holds without fraud White v. Neaylon ([6]).\nThe \"Land Titles Act\" is in force in the Yukon Territory and alone governs all questions regarding title to lands bought under the Act. The provisions of the English statute 2 & 3 Vict. ch. 11, as to filing lis pendens, is not in force in the Yukon Territory, neither are the rules and practice of the courts of law upon this subject as they were repealed by that statute, 2 & 3 Vict. ch. 11, and were not, on the 15th July, 1870, a part of the English law introduced into the Territories. R.S.C. ch. 50, s. 11.\nConstructive notice is not sufficient to set aside a registered title. Actual notice amounting to fraud must be clearly proved and lis pendens is not notice for that purpose. A registered title stands upon a different footing from an ordinary conveyance. Wyatt v. Barwell ([7]); LeNeve v. LeNeve ([8]); Hine v. Dodd ([9]); Jolland v. Stainbridge ([10]); Chadwick v. Turner ([11]), Russell v. Cushell ([12]); Agra Bank v. Barry ([13]) over-ruling Wormald v. Maitland ([14]). Nothing short of actual notice, such as makes it a fraud on the part of the purchaser to insist on the registry laws, is sufficient to disentitle the party to insist in equity on a legal priority acquired under the statute. Boss v. Hunter ([15]), per Strong J.; City of Toronto v. Jarvis ([16]); New Brunswick Railway Co. v. Kelly ([17]). Notice under the registration Acts and under the \"Land Titles Act\" are widely different, and the effect of notice is not the same. The principles are entirely different whether under the Statute of Elizabeth or under the \"Land Titles Act.\" The policy of the \"Land Titles Act\" is that the public office should supply the means of knowing with certainty the information required by any one dealing with land. Gibbs v. Messer ([18]). The principle upon which LeNeve v. LeNeve was decided, as explained by Lord Hardwick in that case, was that the policy of the registry Acts was to prevent the mischief arising from secret conveyances, and that they did not apply to cases in which a person claiming under a registered deed had notice of prior deeds or equities Greaves v. Tofield ([19]). This case depends upon the construction of the \"Land Titles Act.\" There is no provision for lis pendens in the Act. Section 99 provides for a caveat; no caveat was filed in this case. The syndicate were bon\u00e2 fide purchasers and justified in taking the conveyance from Mrs. McConnell and paying her the price agreed upon. The plaintiff cannot complain because the law provides a simple remedy which he did not choose to follow.\nThe term \"fraud\" in the \"Land Titles Act\" is a fraud of both of the parties. The purchaser is not to be affected by notice, direct or implied or constructive, of any trust or unregistered interest and the knowledge that any trust or unregistered interest is in existence shall not of itself be imputed as fraud wherein the purchaser or other person acquiring title has partici-pated or colluded. There is no. attempt to fasten any wrong-doing upon the) syndicate except that its solicitor advised it that the notice of lis pendens was of no avail and that they need not pay attention to it. They were in perfect good faith and in reliance upon the solicitor, the certificate of title and the fact that no caveat had been filed. The plaintiff did not prove com-plicity amounting to absolute fraud. See In re Johnson ([20]); Pennell v. Reynolds ([21]); Kevan v Crawford ([22]).\nThe effect of the judgment is to place the syndicate in the position that it would have been in if it had been a party to the action or a caveat had been duly registered before it obtained its certificate of title and, consequently, it is contrary to the whole spirit and intention of the \"Land Titles Act,\" and to its express language. See remarks of Manning J. in Cooke v. Union Bank ([23]); Gregory v. Alger ([24]), at pages 573-574, per Williams J. and at page 575, pet Hood J., also Baker's Creek Consolidated Gold Mining Co. v. Hack ([25]), at page 223, per Owen C.J., quoting Gibbs v. Messer([26]), at page 254; Longeway v. Mitchell ([27]); Allan v. McTavish ([28]); Godfrey v. Poole ([29]).\nThe plaintiff is not entitled to succeed in this action because the notes were tranferred to him after maturity and after the alleged fraudulent transfers set up in the statement of claim in this cause. See Byles on Bills (ed.) 183. The indorsements to McGrade did not assign any collateral rights which the payees may have had to set aside the conveyance as fraudulent but only the right to sue upon the notes. See Shand v. Du Buisson ([30]); Hopkinson v. Foster ([31]).\nEwart K.C. for the respondent. All the judges in both lower courts having held that the transfers from McConnell to his wife were made in fraud of creditors, the only remaining points in dispute are: 1. Whether McGrade was qualified originally to launch this action on behalf of himself and all other creditors of his debtor, McConnell; and 2. Whether the syndicate, as purchasers from McConnell's wife of the real estate in question, were affected with actual notice of the pendency of this action at the time that they completed the purchase. The evidence upon both questions, and the law applicable to such matters, have been exhaustively treated in the considered judgments of both Craig J. and MacAulay J. The respondent McGrade confidently relies upon them in the present appeal.\nMcGrade was the holder of the notes for upwards of $18,000, the larger of which was made on the 26th August, 1899. The conveyances by McConnell to his wife were not made until April, 1900. Consequently, the guilty transferor was indebted thereon at the time of the execution of the impeached con- veyances. Before the syndicate filed its defence in June, 1903, for $18,349 94, against Edward McConnell on the notes in question, execution had issued thereon and a return of nulla bona had been obtained. McGrade was, therefore, at the time of delivery of his amended statement of claim to the syndicate (29th May, 1903), an execution creditor of McConnell, and was thus a judgment creditor of McConnell both before issue was thus joined and at the date of the trial (6th August, 1903). Even as a simple contract creditor McGrade was competent to bring this action, on behalf of himself and all other creditors of the guilty transferor, under the Statute at 13th Elizabeth. See Twyne's Case ([32]); In re Mouat ([33]); and cases cited by the judges in the court below.\nAs to actual notice of these proceedings, under 13th Elizabeth, at and prior to the completion of the purchase from Mrs. McConnell, the evidence is clear and uncontradicted that both the syndicate's general agent and solicitor had full and actual notice of the contents of the lis pendens, issued and registered, on the 2nd October, 1901; while the purchase and conveyance were not completed until the following year, 21st June, 1902.\nThe case is one of express or actual notice and the matter was deliberately considered prior to payment by the syndicate to Mrs. McConnell. These agents of the syndicate do not deny notice of lis pendens, but they risked ignoring it, on an unsound view of its legal effect and of the equitable doctrine of notice applicable to such a case. See Armour on Titles (3 ed.) p. 189;. 7 Eng. Encycl. of Law, p. 486.\nThis appeal turns rather on the general equitable doctrine of notice (9 Eng. Encycl. p. 189 and cases therein cited); LeNeve v. LeNeve ([34]); Agra Bank v. Barry ([35]); Kennedy v. Green ([36]).\nThe law of England, as it existed on 15th July, 1870, is in force in the Yukon Territory so far as applicable; hence, the imperial statute, 2 & 3 Vict. ch. 11, is in force there, and the notice of lis pendens was properly issued and registered and affects the syndicate as a subsequent purchaser. On the other hand, if that Act be not in force, as argued, then the general English law of lis pendens, as against a purchaser with actual notice thereof, is applicable, namely, the law of lis pendens as it existed in England prior to 2 & 3 Vict ch. 11.\nAs to the points argued, so far, we cite generally' Best on Evidence (7 ed.) p. 578; Freeman, Judicature Acts, 277; Reese River Mining Co. v. Atwell ([37]); Shelford Real Property Acts, (9 ed.) p. 366 ; Ont. Jud. Act, sec. 97; Holmstead & Langton, p. 135; Blair v. The Assets Co. ([38]); Colonial Bank of Australasia v. Pie ([39]); Baxter v. Middleton ([40]); Parker v. Parker ([41]); Morewood v. South Yorkshire Railway and River Dun Co. ([42])\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014I would allow this appeal in part without costs, by striking out of the judgment the words\nand that such lands be sold to satisfy the execution of the appellant issued out of the said Territorial Court of the Yukon Territory against the defendant, Edward McConnell.\nSee Oliver v. McLaughlin ([43]).\nFor the reasons given by Mr. Justice Macaulay in the court below, I would confirm the part of the judg- ment declaring the deed from McConnell to his wife void and fraudulent as against his creditors and that the syndicate holds title subject to the claims of the said creditors.\nI do not see the least room for doubting that the syndicate purchased with full knowledge of the danger they were exposing themselves to.\nAs to the amendments suggested by my brother Nesbitt, I am not in favour of allowing it. It has not been asked for and I do not see upon what ground the Syndicate should be permitted to \"bis vexari \" their adversaries.\nSedgewick and Davies JJ. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs and allowing the amendment by the appellants upon terms, for the reasons stated by Nesbitt J.\nNesbitt J. \u2014As pointed out in the judgment of my brother Idington which I have had an opportunity of reading, the defendants, the syndicate, are bound by the rules of pleading in force in the Yukon, rules 113,115 and 117 of the ordinances 1902, by the allegation of the debt, the fraudulent intent between the McConnells and by the amended pleading of the amount of the judgment, and cannot be heard to dispute the facts alleged. It is to be regretted that this is so for the argument of Mr. Chrysler convinced me that had these points been open to him we should have held following Ex parte Mercer; in re Wise ([44]), that no case was made out for relief against the syndicate.\nAssuming that we are bound to hold that the deed between the McConnells was a fraud against the plaintiff, we then have this deed attacked in an action commenced before the purchase by the syndicate from Mrs. McConnell. This distinguishes the case from Dalglish v. McCarthy ([45]), which I thought upon all fours with this case and which, apart from section 126 of the \"Land Titles Act\" ([46]) would have clearly brought the case within the doctrine of a purchase pendenle lite. I agree that the 2 & 3 Vict. ch. 11, sec. 7, is not applicable to the Yukon, but this Act is in relief of bon\u00e2 fide purchasers and so, but for the section I refer to, the purchaser would be under the old rule of law and bound by the result of the litigation of which he had no notice. I need not refer to cases on this point. What then is the effect of section 126, which is in the following words:\nExcept in the case of fraud, no person, contracting or dealing with, or taking or proposing to take, a transfer, mortgage, encumbrance or lease from, the owner of any land, for which a certificate of title has been granted, shall be bound or concerned to inquire into or ascertain the circumstances in, or the consideration for which, the owner or any previous owner of the land is or was registered, or to see to the application of the purchase money or of any part thereof, nor shall he be affected by notice direct, implied or constructive, of any trust or unregistered interest in the land, any rule of law or equity to the contrary notwithstanding ; and the knowledge that any trust or unregistered interest is in existence, shall not of itself be imputed as fraud.\nI do not think a narrow interpretation should be placed on this; and I do not agree with some of the observations of my brother Idington as to its construction. I do not think the registrar had any right to register a lis pendens, nor do I think the form of certificate issued by him can have the effect of cutting-down the effect of section 126. While there is a discretion vested in the registrar it must be exercised within the limits prescribed by the Act. The whole scope of the New Zealand Act of 1885 (which I have gone over, so far as this point is concerned and which is substantially the same as the Act in question) is fully considered in the case of The Assets Company V. Mere Roihi ([47]). This case came to hand since the argument. The Act was passed in aid of the safe and easy transfer of property and to free such transfer from embarrassing questions of notice of trusts and even from knowledge of their existence, and I think the best interests of the commercial community are served by giving the freest and widest interpretation to the latter part of the section. The case seems, however, because of the pending action and actual notice and knowledge of the frauds by which Mrs. McConnell became the registered owner, to fall expressly within the language of the judicial committee in the case quoted (at page 316)\u2014\nBy fraud in those Acts was meant actual fraud\u2014i.e., dishonesty of some sort; not what was called constructive or equitable fraud, an unfortunate expression and one very apt to mislead, but often used, for want of a better term, to denote transactions having consequences in equity similar to those which flowed from fraud. Further, it appeared to their lordships that the fraud which must be proved in order to invalidate the title of a registered purchaser for value, whether he bought from a prior registered owner or from a person claiming under a title certified under the Native Land Acts, must be brought home to the person whose registered title was impeached or to his agents. Fraud by persons from whom he claimed did not affect him unless knowledge of it was brought home to him or his agents. The mere fact that he might have found out fraud if he had been more vigilant and had made further inquiries which he omitted to make did not of itself prove fraud on his part. But if it be shewn that his suspicions were aroused and that he abstained from making inquiries for fear of learning the truth, the case was very different and fraud might be properly ascribed to him. A person who presented for registration a document which was forged or had been fraudulently or improperly obtained, was not guilty of fraud if he honestly believed it to be a genuine document which could be properly acted upon. In dealing with colonial titles depending on the system of registration which they had adopted, it was most important that the foregoing principles should be borne in mind, for if they were lost sight of that system would be rendered unworkable.\nI therefore think that, although in this case, if the suit had not been commenced the syndicate could have relied on section 126 as a full protection, they cannot do so where the suit has been begun impeaching the conveyance and the syndicate have full notice of it.\nAs Bump on Fraudulent Conveyances says: [sec. 17].\nIf another receives the property with notice of the fraud, he is aiding the debtor to cheat his creditors, and this (he law never tolerates).\nThe first deed is voidable only and when the title [sec. 492]\nhas passed into the hands of an innocent holder, even this infirmity is cured and the title becomes sound and indefeasible.\nIf he does not give a valuable consideration and if he has notice of the fraud, he is in the same position towards the creditors as the fraudulent grantee, for he is, in the contemplation of the law, a participant in the fraud [sec. 493.]\nKerr on Fraud, p. 324:\nThe right to impeach a transaction on the ground of fraud has no place against third parties who have paid money and acquired a legal title to property without notice of fraud.\nMay on Fraudulent Conveyances, after stating that until the first deed is\nmade void by \"creditors and others\" it is a valid deed and one by virtue of which the legal estate vests in the voluntary grantee, subject to its being divested,\nproceeds as follows:\nThe right of the person defrauded under these statutes to elect to avoid a deed as fraudulent may be lost in either of the following ways:\nFirst, it may be lost by the deed having become for value, by a consideration ex post facto before any steps are taken by that person to impeach it.\nSecondly, the voluntary grantee may have divested himself of the property by a bon\u00e2 fide transfer of it for value to a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser for value without notice of the fraud.\nSee May 325 and also 317.\nI have gone into the case thus fully because it raises a most important question as to the proper construction of section 126 of \u201cThe Land Titles Act.\u201d As our judgment, however, is based on the ground that owing to the syndicate not having pleaded specifically that no debt existed on the note sued on which plaintiff was entitled to recover and that McConnell's deed to his wife was not for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff and his other creditors, and as the only evidence given by the plaintiff as against the McConnell plea to that effect seems to shew that had the syndicate so pleaded they might have been entitled to judgment in their favour, I would send the case back and allow them, if they so desire, to so amend their pleadings and to raise this point, but, on condition of their first paying all costs incurred since these pleadings were filed within thirty days after taxation thereof and filing their amended pleading within the same time. If they, establish this defence they should succeed; if they fail on such defence then the present judgment to stand.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellants purchased from Luella Day McConnell real estate in the Yukon. This she had got from her husband Edward McConnell by conveyance of April, 1900, which the trial judge and the court en banc in the Yukon have both found or respectively found and assumed were fraudulent and void as against creditors. The respondent, McGrade, had become the holder of promissory notes made by the said Edward McConnell and, on the 9th September, 1901, sued him to recover the amounts thereof. Pending that action the respondent, on the 2nd October, 1901, began this action on behalf of himself and all other creditors of said Edward McConnell against Edward McConnell and his wife, to have said deeds of conveyance declared fraudulent and void as against creditors.\nBy deed of 21st June, 1902, Mrs. McConnell conveyed said real estate to the appellants, the Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke, for the alleged consideration of $40,000 and they claim under said deed to be purchasers in good faith for value and without notice, or if not, at least by virtue of the provisions of \"The Land Titles Act,\" to have an unassailable title.\nOn the 29th January, 1903, the respondent McGrade recovered judgment in the said suit against Edward McConnell for the amount of the promissory notes in question and judgment having been entered up he, McGrade, applied in this action and got leave to amend and to add the appellants as defendants herein and did so, alleging amongst other things the recovery of the said judgment against Edward McConnell.\nThe appellants, as defendants, thereupon pleaded to the amended statement of claim a defence that neither denied the said debt being due nor the said judgment nor the fraud charged in regard to the conveyance from McConnell to his wife. At the trial the McConnells made no defence, but, having by their statement of defence denied liability and the alleged fraud, it became necessary for the plaintiff to put in formal proof of both\nAmongst other things filed for this purpose was proof of the judgment that had been so recovered, and some further evidence I need not touch upon here for reasons which will presently appear. Judgment was duly entered herein accordingly by the learned trial judge against the McConnells who have not appealed.\nThe appellants, as I have said, did not by their statement of defence raise any defence as to the indebtedness of McConnell to the respondent or the fraudulent character of the deeds of conveyance from McConnell to his wife, but contented themselves with the defence which I may paraphrase as being that of bon\u00e2 fide purchasers without notice, that the alleged certificate of lis pendens filed in the office of the registrar was not in accordance with the law, and that registration thereof was illegal and of no effect, and that in in any event notice derived from such irregular and illegal registration of the certificate of lis pendens was null against appellants under the \"Land Titles Act.\"\nThough neither at the trial nor en banc upon appeal therefrom nor in their factum here was there any objection taken by the appellants for want of proof, as against them, in respect of the debt, or the fraudulent character of the deed from McConnell to his wife, it is now taken here orally.\nI do not think it is at this stage open to the appellants to take any such objection under such circumstances. I don't think, in view of the requirements of the Yukon Consolidated Ordinances, 1902, ch. 17, rules 113, 115 and 117, requiring defences to be pleaded, that such objections, without pleadings, were ever open to the appellants. It would seem elementary law that upon such legislation the case of each defendant must be tried upon and by the issues he sees fit to set up and is neither to be helped nor hindered by anything his co-defendants may by their pleading have set up.\nRule 113:\nEvery allegation of fact in any pleading not being a petition or summons if not denied specifically or by necessary implication or stated to be not admitted in the pleading of the opposing party shall be taken to be admitted except as against an infant, lunatic or person of unsound mind not so found judicially.\nI assume, therefore, that the judgment appealed from was rightfully entered against the appellants unless by virtue of their own pleading they have made good the defences specially pleaded by them. In their pleading they do not specifically claim the protection for their title of the provisions of the \"Land Titles Act.\" What they do seek to set up is rather pointed at than pleaded. Assuming the protection of the statute to have been properly pleaded, if, and so far as, open to the appellants, I think we can better understand the position the appellants are in by referring to the doctrine of lis pendens.\nThe appellants bought, if they did buy, pendente lite. They did so in a territory where the laws of England relating to civil and criminal matters, as the same existed on the 15th day of July, A.D. 1870, were in force in so far as the same were applicable to the Yukon Territory, and in so far as the same have not been repealed, altered, varied, modified or affected by any Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom applicable to the Territories, or of the Parliament of Canada or by any Ordinance of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. (See \"North-West Territories Act.\" R.S.C. ch. 50, sec. 11).\nThat part of the law of England that provides for the registration of notice of lis pendens and the restriction of the law as expressed in the maxim of pendente lite nihil innovetur, so that innocent purchasers pendenle lite might be protected, is not in force in the Yukon. The registration provisions in England being of a purely local character were not carried into the Yukon by the general introduction of English law. Counsel wisely abstained from arguing that they were.\nIt was urged that, notwithstanding the absence of such legal enactment in any way, the general law of England as it existed before such law's for registration and legislation restrictive of the effect of lis pendens or since, and so far as unaffected by it, did not touch the case of a suit such as this, wherein it is sought to have a deed fraudulent as against creditors so declared and set aside. I am unable to distinguish such a case from the many other cases in which the lis pendens relating to real estate or an interest therein has been repeatedly held to bind purchasers acquiring pendente lite from or through the defendant of an estate or interest in the real estate brought in question by the lis pendens\n2 Coke on Littleton, 102, a. b. gives this illustration:\nUpon a judgment in debt the plaintiff shall not have execution but only of that land which the defendant had at the time of the judgment for that the action was brought in respect to the person and not in respect to the land, but if an action of debt be brought against the heirs and he alieneth hanging the writ yet shall the land which he had at the time of the original purchase be charged for that the action was brought against the heirs in respect of the land.\nIt is illustrated also at p. 344 (b) of Coke on Littleton by the proceedings of quare impedit as against the ordinary in relation to presentation by one not having the right of presentation.\nThe doctrine has been applied in the cases of foreclosure and redemption as in Winchester v. Paine ([48]) and cases cited there; Martin v. Styles ([49]) in relation to an agreement respecting land ; Garth v. Ward ([50]) as to establishing a will as against an heir and affecting his vendee ; Landon v. Morris ([51]), to make good a representation as to title to land; Walker v. Smalwood ([52]), to enforce a charge of debts upon lands, and in numerous similar cases including that of creditors as against the heir at law.\nIn Murray v. Ballou ([53]) the late Chancellor Kent reviews the early law and refers to these and other cases illustrating it. See Cases in Equity by Martin, at p. 344 et seq.\nThe registration Acts, as far as I can see, seem to recognise the cases such as that in hand as peculiarly of the classes that come within the principle of lis pendens binding all purchasers from defendants pendente lite.\nThe doctrine is reviewed again and so stated by Lord Cranworth in Bellamy v. Sabine ([54]) at p. 158 et seq. as to remove the impression got from a loose way of referring to it as notice where he says:\nIt is scarcely correct to speak of lis pendens as affecting a purchaser through the doctrine of notice, for the language of courts often so describes its operation. It affects him not because it amounts to notice but because the law does not allow litigant parties to give to others pending the litigation rights to the property in dispute so as to prejudice the opposite party.\nNow, has this doctrine been invaded or modified by \"The Land Titles Act?\" Or are the provisions of \u201cThe Land Titles Act\" to be read as subject to this general doctrine of the English law?\nThe earliest restriction upon the operation of lis pendens is contained in the order of Lord Bacon that\nno decree bindeth any that come in bon\u00e2 fide by conveyance from the defendant before the bill exhibited and is made no party neither by bill nor order; but where he comes in pendente lite and while the suit is in full prosecution and without any colour of allowance or privity of the court there regularly the decree bindeth.\nRegistration Acts both in England and in this country have proceeded upon the principle of restricting the operation of lis pendens for the beneficent purpose of protecting innocent grantees, whilst according to a plaintiff in a pending suit ample opportunity for protecting his rights. The \"Land Titles Act, 1894,\" seems to have been designed for the same purpose as registration Acts, merely extending their operation and at the same time facilitating the transfer of real estate. Sec. 55 provides that:\nThe owner of land for which a certificate of title has been granted, shall hold the same subject (in addition to the incidents implied by virtue of this Act) to such encumbrances, liens, estates or interests, as are notified on the folio of the register which constitute the certificate of title, absolutely free from all other encumbrances, liens, estates or interests whatsoever, except in case of fraud wherein he has participated or colluded, and except the estate or interest of an owner claiming the same land under a prior certificate of title granted under the provisions of this Act.\nSec. 57 provides:\nEvery certificate of title granted under this Act shall (except in case of fraud, wherein the owner has participated or colluded), so long as the same remains in force and uncancelled under this Act, be conclusive evidence in all courts as against Her Majesty and all persons whomsoever that the person named therein is entitled to the land included in the same, for the estate or interest therein specified subject to the exceptions and reservations mentioned in the next preceding section, &c., &c.\nOf those \"exceptions and reservations mentioned in the next preceding section,\" there is provided as follows:\n(e.) Any decrees, orders or executions against or affecting the interest of the owner of the land, which have been registered and maintained in force against the owner.\nSection 59 provides that:\nAfter the certificate of title for any land has been granted no instrument shall be effectual to pass any interest therein or to render the land, liable as security for the payment of money as against any bon\u00e2 fide transferee of the land under this Act, unless such instrument is executed in accordance with the provisions of this Act and is duly registered there under ; and the registrar shall have power to decide whether any instrument which is presented to him for registration is substantially in conformity with the proper form in the schedule to this Act or not, and to reject any instrument which he may decide to be unfit for registration.\nThe word \u201cinstrument\" is interpreted by the second section of the Act to mean\nany grant, certificate of title, conveyance, assurance, deed, map, plan, will, probate, or exemplification of will, letters of administration or an exemplification thereof, mortgage or encumbrance or any other document in writing relating to the transfer of or other dealing with land or evidencing title thereto.\nIt will thus be seen that the certificate is subject to such in cumbrances, liens, estates or interests as are notified on the folio of the register, and that the registrar has power to decide whether any instrument which is presented to him for registration is substantially in conformity with the form in the Act.\nIt is to be observed that on the facts now under consideration, there was at the time of the sale from Mrs. McConnell to the appellants no decree, order or execution against her or her husband affecting the interest of the owner in the land. The interest that the pre- sent respondent had in the land or in relation thereto was a something that is not provided for in express terms by the sections I have quoted, or, I may say, in any other part of the Act. Is it, therefore, to be taken for granted that so valuable a right as plaintiff, or those in a position like him, have in the lands of their debtor which have been fraudulently conveyed, are left without protection especially when we consider that that had, by the doctrine of lis pendens, in the English law for so long such complete protection, and that the scope and purview of this \"Land Titles Act \" was only to furnish a system of registered titles and interests in land?\nIt is quite clear from the provision of 61 Vict, ch. 32, s. 14, amending the \"Land Titles Act,\" that execution creditors are to be protected and the right therein given to lodge a caveat is furnished as a means for their protection. It was urged that this method was open to the respondent, but obviously that was not the case here, for he had not recovered judgment, yet had apparently a right on behalf of himself and all other creditors to impeach the convey-ance from McConnell to his wife for months before he was able to recover judgment and issue execution and avail himself of this caveat. It was during that interval that the appellants intervened and made the purchase now in question.\nI am inclined to think that there is much to be said for the position that respondent may take in claiming that having regard to the scope and purview of the \"Land Titles Act\" it was never intended to sweep away creditors' rights such as plaintiff had at the time of the appellants' purchase. Is the \"Land Titles Act\" there fore not to be read as the \"Bills of Sale Acts\" respecting chattels in England or here, when providing that all instruments not registered were to be fraudulent and void as against creditors, yet were held to be in operation restricted to those conveyances of interests upon which the provisions of the Act were intended to operate and not to be extended to those rights and interests to which the Act did not in express terms extend? (Sec such cases as Ex parte Hubbard, in re Hardwick ([55]); Charlesworth v. Mills ([56]); Hamilton v. Harrison ([57]). It deals with; instruments which are defined, with executions which are defined, and all the rights incidental thereto that were capable of registration. Can it be said to have been intended to take away those rights or interests that were not capable of registration?\nI do not think that it is necessary to determine here expressly the point I have suggested, but I think what I have said is worthy of consideration when we come to interpret the words in sec. 55 of the \"Land Titles Act, 1894,\" declaring the certificate to be subject to such incumbrances, &c, as are notified on the folio of the register and the registrar's powers referred to in sec. 59, and having regard to the fact that here there was an instrument constituting a notice entered upon the register and expressly set forth upon the certificate of title upon which the appellants rely for their protection. That certificate had written upon it the follow-ing:\nThe title of Le Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke is subject to a lis pendens issued out of the T. C. Y. Ty. between T. J. McGrade et al., plaintiffs, and L. D. McConnell, defendant, dated 2nd October, 1901, and registered at 11.45 a.m. the 2nd October, 1901, as No. 4637.\nHow can it be said even if the appellants had properly pleaded the protection of the \"Land Titles Act\" and the sections therein, claimed by them to be intended to give them an absolute title, that a certificate of this kind can give protection against respondent's claim? They claim by virtue of the Act giving vitality to the certificate. To make good that claim they must, I think, rest upon a certificate, if even then they would be entitled to protection, that is clearly within the Act and in no wise beyond its provisions or suggesting upon its face any other title or interest than that they claim. They are claiming obviously against the common law right of the respondents and must bring themselves clearly within the provisions of the law that would exempt them from the operation of the common law. I think they have not succeeded in doing so. Moreover, I think when the facts are borne in mind surrounding their acceptance of the certificate, the express notice thereof, the full consideration thereof, the probable communication with their grantor on the subject, and their determination to risk the interpretation of the statute, despite the rights of others which I take it they well knew of and understood, that the appellants cannot escape from the conclusions arrived at by Mr. Justice Craig in light of the authorities cited in the latter part of his judgment, that they were using the Act of Parliament as an instrument for accomplishing a fraud and there by made themselves parties who have participated in the fraud which their action alone was calculated to render successful, if it was not the main purpose and object of the whole transaction.\nI need not repeat the reasons given in the concluding part of Mr. Justice Craig's judgment, but content myself with expressing concurrence therein.\nSec. 126 of the \"Land Titles Act\" does not in this view furnish any protection to the appellants.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSince writing the foregoing my attention is drawn by my brother Nesbitt to the case he refers to; The Assets Co. v. Mere Roihi ([58]); just come to hand, which Seems in point and, if I had seen it earlier, I might have been saved some of my labour.\nI desire to add that I concur in the leave given appellants to amend on terms.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Bleecker & O'Dell.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Clark, Wilson & Stackpoole.\n[1] 7 Man.

MOTION before the Registrar in Chambers for leave to appeal direct from the judgment of the Chancellor of Ontario without any appeal being first had to a Divisional Court or the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe material facts are set out in the judgment of the Registrar.\nGeo. F. Henderson for the motion.\nA. F. May, contra.\nTHE REGISTRAR.\u2014This is an application for leave to appeal per saltum from the judgment of the Honourable the Chancellor of Ontario, without any intermediate appeal being had to the Divisional Court or to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The facts of the case are, shortly, as follows:\nThe London and Port Stanley gravel road is a toll road vested in the corporation of the County of Elgin. In 1857 the defendants leased the said road to the predecessors in title of the plaintiff, and the lease contained a provision whereby the defendants covenanted that whenever the corporation could legally sell or convey the road to the plaintiff's predecessors in title, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, or to any company to be formed by him for that purpose, that the municipal council should thereupon convey their right, title and interest in the road upon payment of the first nineteen years' rent reserved by the lease and upon receiving satisfactory security for the balance of the rent.\nThe plaintiff then alleged that he had paid the nineteen years rent and was entitled to receive a conveyance of the toll road, but that the defendants had refused to convey the same to him. The defendants pleaded amongst other things that the lease was ultra vires of the municipal council, and by way of counterclaim prayed that the lease be declared null and void.\nThis action was tried before the Chancellor of Ontario, in St. Thomas, on the 19th December, 1904, who gave judgment indorsed on the copy of the pleadings as follows:\u2014\nJudgment for plaintiff with costs declaring plaintiff entitled to conveyance of property to be settled by the master if parties do not agree. Stay of execution of judgment for four months; leave to apply. G. A. Boyd.\nJudgment on counterclaim, that it be dismissed with costs.\nThe shorthand notes contained the following discussion between the chancellor and counsel when judgment was being pronounced:\nHis Lordship: The case of Caughell, (Payne v. Caughell[1], binds me as to the law.\nMr. Glenn: (for the defendant). I ask for a longer stay than ordinary stay.\nHis Lordship: Oh, yes.\nMr. Glenn: I intend to apply for leave from the Supreme Court to go direct there.\nHis Lordship: Oh, yes; I think that is reasonable. You should have all the time necessary to have an effectual pleading. There is no use going to the Court of Appeal if I understand the decision aright. The judges have committed themselves to this view of the case, so you would probably be justified in going down to the Supreme Court. Mr. Hodgins I think spoke of that before you came in about that being the forum of appeal. I think you should be facilitated in that.\nMr. Glenn: Of course it is a case in which very little can be said to Your Lordship if that opinion binds you.\nHis Lordship: I feel that that case binds me; if not the precise decision, the opinions of the judges.\nMr. Glenn: Of course I think the law of your own court is the law. Payne v. Caughell.[2]\nHis Lordship: I thought so too, at the time, but I cannot say that now. We get wiser as we go on. I think I will have to give judgment for plaintiff with costs.\nThe minutes of judgment were not settled and entered until the 11th day of February, 1905. The present application was launched on the 30th day of March, more than three months after the date of the pronouncing of the judgment, but within sixty days from the date of the entry of the judgment. It is not alleged nor established before me that there was any difficulty in settling the minutes of judgment in this case. Apparently the successful party at his leisure drafted the minutes, and these were settled by the local master at St. Thomas according to the draft. It was not necessary to speak to the minutes, nor can I find that there would have been any difficulty whatever in settling the minutes promptly after the judgment was pronounced. Probably the delay was owing to the fact that the unsuccessful party thought that, with a stay for four months, there was no urgency in having the minutes settled. Upon the argument I raised the question as to my jurisdiction to make the order asked, in view of the decisions of this court in Barrett v. Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondike[3], and Lee v. Canada Mutual Loan and Investment Co.[4], and a full consideration of the decisions of the court bearing on the application have confirmed my first impression.\nMr. Henderson in his very able argument contended that the date of the pronouncing of the judgment applied to common law cases, and the date of the entry of the judgment applied to equity cases, and that where law and equity are fused as in the Province of Ontario, a case which under the old practice would have resulted in a decree in equity, the time would begin to run from the date of the entry of the judgment, and in support of his contention cited the words used by Chief Justice Ritchie in Vaughan v. Richardson[5]. The learned Chief Justice is there dealing with the effect of section 41 of the Act which required that a notice of appeal should be given within twenty days from the time the judgment was pronounced, and he makes use of the following words:\u2014\nIt (the notice) must be given in a case such as this within twenty days from the time that judgment is pronounced, for we have held that in common law cases the time runs from the pronouncing of the judgment. A different rule prevails in equity cases where the minutes have to be settled before judgment can be entered.\nAssuming that, in the view of the Chief Justice, the distinction between common law and equity judgments was the feature which determined the date from which time should run, it does not appear that a judgment on this point was necessary to a decision in the case. He there held that no appeal lay to the Supreme Court because the notice required to be given by section 41 never had been given either within the twenty days or after, and this is the reason also given by Mr. Justice Strong and Mr. Justice Taschereau for quashing the appeal.\nThe later cases, in my opinion, are not consistent with the view of Chief Justice Ritchie on this point. In Martin v. Sampson[6], an action was brought by an assignee for the benefit of creditors to set aside a chattel mortgage which was alleged to be void on the ground that the affidavit of bona fides was insufficient under the statute. The trial judge held the chattel mortgage void. The Court of Appeal set aside the judgment below and dismissed the action with costs. This latter judgment was rendered on the 7th November, 1895. Immediately after the rendering of judgment, the solicitors for the mortgagee served the usual notice for settlement of the minutes of judgment and, the draft minutes as served included a direction that costs should be paid both to the appellant and the mortgagor, he having been joined in the action, and named with the mortgagee as a defendant, but the plaintiff contended that the mortgagor was never actually a party and was not represented by counsel nor heard upon the appeal. The Registrar of the Court of Appeal, in settling the minutes, held that the mortgagor was not entitled to costs. He also in other respects altered the draft minutes of judgment by making a provision that the mortgagee was entitled to moneys deposited in the Bank of Hamilton to abide the final judgment in the action. No objection was taken by either side to the alterations in the draft minutes made by the Registrar, and the minutes were not spoken to before either a judge or the court. It was held both by Mr. Justice Osier in the court below, before whom the first application to allow the security was made, and by the Registrar of the Supreme Court, affirmed by Mr. Justice Gwynne, before whom a second application was made to allow the security, that, under the decisions of the Supreme Court, the time should run from the pronouncing and not from the entry of the judgment.\nIt will be seen, therefore, that this was a case which, under the old practice, whould have required a bill filed in equity to obtain the relief asked by the plaintiff, and if the view of Chief Justice Ritchie in Vaughan v. Richardson[7] was adopted, it was a case in which the court should have held that the time ran from the date of the entry of the judgment.\nIn O'Sullivan v. Harty[8], and Martley v. Carson[9] where the court held that the time ran from the date of the entry of the judgment, we find that questions arose upon settlement of the minutes by the Registrar which were brought before the court appealed from for determination, and this, it seems to me, was the factor which, in the view of the Supreme Court, determined in these cases the date from which the time should begin to run.\nIn my opinion, according to the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court, the date from which time begins to run in appeals under sec. 40 of the Act is always the date of the pronouncing of the judgment, unless an application is made to the court appealed from to review some decision made by the Registrar on the settlement of the minutes, or some substantial question affecting the rights of the parties has not been clearly disposed of by the judgment as pronounced, and the determination of this has delayed the settlement of the minutes.\nApplication dismissed with costs.\nNOTE.\u2014This application, with the decision thereon, having been referred by the Registrar to His Lordship, the Chief Justice, under General Order No. 83, the judgment of the registrar and his reasons therefor were approved.\n[1] 24 Ont.

Barrett (1905), 36 S.C.R. 279\nDate: 1905-05-02\nLe Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke (Plaintiffs on counterclaim) Appellants;\nand\nJoseph Barrett (Defendant on counterclaim) Respondent.\n1905: March 23, 24; 1905: May 2.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Elz\u00e9ar Taschereau C.J. and Girouard, Davies, Nesbitt and Idington JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE TERRITORIAL COURT OF YUKON TERRITORY.\nMines and minerals\u2014 Vendor and purchaser\u2014Sale of mining locations\u2014Consideration in lump sum\u2014 Separate valuations\u2014Misrepresentation\u2014 Deceit and fraud\u2014Measure of damages.\nUpon representations made by the vendor the plaintiffs purchased several mining locations, the consideration therefor being stated in a lump sum. In an action of fraud and deceit brought by the purchaser against the vendor the trial judge, in discussing the total consideration for the properties purchased, found that there was evidence to shew the values placed by the parties upon each of two of these properties as to which false and fraudulent representations had been made, and which had turned out worthless or nearly so.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, the Chief Justice and Idington J dissenting, that the finding of the trial judge as to the consideration ought not to be disturbed upon appeal and that the proper measure of damages, in such a case, was the actual loss sustained by the purchaser by acting upon the misrepresentations of the vendor in respect of the two mining locations in question irrespectively of the results or values yielded by the other locations purchased at the same time and as to which no false representations had been made. Peek v. Derry (37 Ch. D. 541) followed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Territorial Court of the Yukon Territory reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Craig at the trial, and dismissing the appellants' counterclaim against the respondent, with costs.\nThe history of the case is stated by Mr. Justice Craig, the trial judge, as follows: \"The agents of the syndicate, Paillard and Tarut were invited by Barrett to visit these properties, Paillard being the syndicate's manager and agent, and Tarut their assistant manager or operating manager. They were well known to be men who came to this country for the purpose of investing in mining properties, and met Mr. Barrett, who was the owner of these various claims. * * * There is no doubt in my mind that they were prospective purchasers of any property which they thought would be profitable for them to invest in; that their position in the country as such was known, and that those persons having properties which they were willing to dispose of naturally would seek out these men. Paillard and Tarut were quite willing to invest in mining properties; that was their object here, and they were going about the country looking at claims. As to the visit in April * * * they simply went as men. looking about the country. They went on the claim and remained two or three days, and I think it would take them that time to walk over the properties even in a cursory manner. They went down some shafts which were open, spent from twenty minutes to half an hour in the drifts, and walked about and looked at the drifts; did not do any panning in the drifts, but examined the sides and walls with a candle. When they came to the surface of the ground they were shown by Barrett the various drifts or locations of them, and where they had been worked out. Barrett himself says in his evidence that nothing was said about purchasing, but it is admitted that a price was named of $260,000 for these claims, including the dumps, before the parties left, and that they said they were not then considering buying. Barrett himself in his evidence, says: 'We discussed this property after the April visit; I had no notion of a sale; we spoke about the creek claims. There was no intention of leading up to a sale in the conversation; had several such conversations; simply idle conversation without any object.' This evidence came up in reference to another matter which I have to refer to later on, but it is Barrett's sworn statement, and while he contends with one breath that he relies upon the investigation of April as proof that the syndicate knew what they were buying, yet in the other breath, when meeting another aspect of the case, he gives the evidence which I have just cited. But this can matter little because I think that any investigation, if it could be called such, which these agents of the syndicate made in April, was so trifling as not to be called an investigation at all. Still, whatever they did see at that time would no doubt be in their minds, and be probably to a certain extent remembered by them at the subsequent visit in June In view of the evidence given by the agents, and what Barrett says as to the idle nature of the conversation regarding the April visit, I do not find that the syndicate agents went on the ground in April with any intention of purchasing the claim, or with a view of ascertaining the nature of the ground with intent to buy.\n\"We now come to the June visit, and at this visit they certainly went on the ground as prospective purchasers. They were there three or four days visiting these various claims. As to what they did when there I have not the slightest doubt at all. They went on to the claim with Barrett. They asked Barrett to prepare a plan of the ground; Paillard and Tarut both swear to this, and Barrett does not deny it. This is important. The answer which Barrett gave, according to the evidence of these men, was that he was not expert enough to prepare such a plan, but he would shew them the ground and give them all the in- formation. I consider this evidence is important, and is consistent with the evidence given by Paillard and Tarut throughout. They walked over the top of the ground, entered one or two shafts which were then open, because in the great majority of the cases where the old drifts had been taken out the shafts were filled and there was no possibility of entering the drifts. In the drift which they did go down (No. 3) they went about with a candle and looked at the sides. Barrett says they saw gold in the walls. This they say they do not remember. They also went down new shafts in drift 7 on 32 which Barrett was then sinking. They saw machinery. For some time they sat near the shaft and counted the buckets coming up, and in relation to this matter there was an endeavor made * * * to shew that in counting the buckets they were trying to ascertain the value of the property. This to my mind is absolutely absurd. How a person could tell the value of the dirt hauled out of the shaft by counting the buckets passes my comprehension. It was an attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the court, which was very silly. The object of counting the buckets clearly was, both from the evidence of these parties, and from the evidence of the engineer, to see how the machinery was working. In addition to this they either panned themselves or saw some panning done both from the dump and from the faces of open cuts on claim \"12\" and from the dumps and drifts on claim \"32\", and they also saw two or three small cleanups. Barrett pointed out to them where the ground had been worked, that is, the extent of the workings. The main ground of complaint * * * is that the nature of the ground, that is, its richness, was not correctly given to them, and in addition that certain drifts and workings which appeared and were discovered on the ground after the sale, were not pointed out to them by Barrett, and in fact, that in pointing out what had been worked out he gave the impression, therefore, that the ground not so pointed out was still virgin ground and intact. The agents say that while on the ground they noted particularly the extent of the ground worked out as represented by Barrett, and that Paillard took notes of these representations in a notebook which he had with him, and the taking of these notes, it seems to me, is consistent with the statement that they took notes of what Barrett said with intent to rely upon it. Of course it may be argued on the other hand, that it is singular that these parties, in a large transaction, and relying upon representations, did not have those representations in writing and signed by Barrett when they were so various and covered so many distinct points hard to remember. This note book was produced at the trial, and the notes were fyled as exhibits. While I cannot myself follow the notes clearly, yet Paillard in his evidence, pointed out that he had made these notes, and no attempt was made by counsel to shew that the notes did not correspond with the evidence which he was giving in regard to the representations, and I take it that the notes correctly conform to the evidence which he gave, the only question of fact being\u2014were the notes made at the time that Barrett made the representations on the claim? Paillard and Tarut swear they were, the only evidence against that being that the parties present did not see them. Whether or not Paillard and Tarut made pannings themselves, it is certain that some pannings were made for them and in their presence, not extensive probably in all, at the June visit. Some eight or ten pans were washed. This is the extent of the investigation made by the defendants. They sank no holes whatever; there is not a title of evidence to shew that any investigation was ever made on the virgin ground to prove its richness or otherwise. Whatever statements Barrett made as to that they took his word, and the question whether he did or did not make these representations I will deal with later; but it is beyond a doubt that they themselves did not at all explore the untouched soil. They saw pannings made of ground taken out of the then workings. That is the only investigation, if it can be called an investigation, which they made of the placer ground. As to the extent of the old workings, it is also equally clear to my mind that they made no investigation themselves, and it is not seriously contended that they did make any investigation themselves to ascertain the extent of the old working's. Whatever information they had as to those old workings they got from Barrett and could get it from no one else. In the nature of things it was impossible for them to learn the extent of the old workings because, as is admitted, the shafts entering these old workings were not open. Barrett does not deny that he pointed out the old workings. He does deny the representations alleged respecting the richness of the ground to a certain extent. We are now in this position; two men from France who had previously had some experience in the Klondyke\u2014limited, it is true, but they had bought claims before, and spent some little time in the territory, had gone home to France and organized a new company\u2014came out here and bought this property, paying for it the very large sum of $167,000. They made the investigation which I have indicated and no more. The contention is that the investigation which they made was a sufficiently independent investigation to enable them to rely upon their own judgment and not upon the statements of Barrett, and if their present contention be correct they might just as well have taken the representations anywhere else as on the claim; that it was a useless piece of work for them to go on the claim at all if they so fully relied on Barrett as they now contend they did. I cannot myself see the force of that argument. * * * * They contend that they relied absolutely on Barrett and his representations; they went upon the property which they were thinking of purchasing for the purpose of seeing it, its situation, the extent of the workings and the mode in which it was worked, and it is reasonable to believe they would do that and at the same time rely upon Barrett's representations as to the nature of the soil. As I have said before, as to the extent of the workings they had to rely upon Barrett. These properties are all placer claims. In this territory gold in placer claims is found in various conditions. In the creeks it usually runs in well defined pay streaks, parts being richer than others, the theory being that the gold is deposited by its own weight and settles to the bottom through the loose gravel as washed down. It is also found on hillsides and benches in varying depth and in varying quantities, sometimes a wide extent and of considerable depth, and the nature of the pay depends entirely Upon the quantity of placer ground in one place, and the ease with which that can be worked or operated, and many things enter into the cost of working these grounds\u2014the difficulty of handling water, the amount of waste to be removed, the depth of the shaft to be sunk, the price of wood in that vicinity, and the distance from centre of supplies. Some attempt was made during the trial to show the syndicate did not work these claims properly, but I will take no account of that because it was not followed up in such a manner that I could make any deduction from the evidence, because it was clearly sworn to that the cost of operating mines depends entirely upon the surrounding conditions, and no comparison could be made unless all the conditions of the various claims worked were considered.\n\"As to the extent of the old operations, as I have said, the syndicate had to rely upon Barrett, and did rely upon what he said. * * * They contend respecting claim \"32 \"that Barrett in pointing out a drift known, as \"drift 9 \" said that the extent of the workings was only about 30 by 30 feet, whereas it was afterwards discovered that over 8,000 square feet of bed rock was uncovered and taken out. Barrett denies making any such representation, but says that he told them that the former owner had told him he had worked out only that small quantity. On this point there is the evidence of two against one, and I must believe the two. I believe that Barret' must have known of the extent of that working, and I find as a fact that the extent of the workings is as sworn to by the agents, and that Barrett did say that only 30 by 30 feet was worked out. Coming to claim 12, I have more difficulty.* * *The contention is that Barrett in showing the extent of the old workings pointed out only a drift marked. \"3\" on the plan, and did not point out another drift marked \"4\" * * *since discovered to have been worked out. Paillard and Tarut both say that he pointed out drift \"3,\" known as \"Lamar drift,\" but did not point out drift \"4,\" know as the \"Cassidy drift.\" Barrett swears that he did point out both drifts. Paillard and Tarut say that the name of Cassidy was not mentioned. A man called Soper, * * * in this respect confirms Paillard and Tarut as to the location of the drift, but he says that the name of Cassidy was used. Now, the name is not important in this connection; the location of the drift and the extent of it is the all important thing, and here we have the evidence of Paillard and Tarut and Soper to this, that Barrett did not point out any drift where \"4\" now exists. It is true that a witness called Renaud, called on behalf of Barratt, swears that Barrett asked him in the presence of Paillard and Tarut if it was Cassidy's drift that \" we saw on the right, and I said I thought it was one of Cassidy's or Lamar's.\" This would indicate that the name of Cassidy was used again, but Cassidy himself was called on behalf of the syndicate and he says that no indications could be seen of where this shaft was. Barrett's witnesses swear that the cribbing could be seen. Cassidy denies this. He was the man who made the drift; he also swears that the shaft was not timbered, but that a scaffolding was erected upon the top of the shaft for the purpose of hoisting the dirt, which scaffolding he says had disappeared. Tailings were all over the place and might as readily have come from one drift as the other, and no one could tell whether the tailings had come from three, four, or the adjoining claim. I am inclined to think that the weight of evidence is with the syndicate on this matter, and that Barrett did not point out drift \"No. 4.\"\n\"As to the richness of the ground, * * * Paillard's evidence is the following, * * * 'He (Barrett) showed us the part worked out and the parts left to be worked; he gave us the figures for each and every drift; I put them on my memorandum at the same time, and he said that the same pay would be found all over the claim.' Further on Paillard swears that Barrett said that ' the same pay which had been found in those different drifts was to be found all over the claim from rim to rim; he told me that several times. 'Further on:' Q. Did he state to you at any time how he arrived at the knowledge that '32' was a claim that would yield such enormous profit?\u2014A. He said that judging from the amount of gold he had taken from those drifts, and being certain that the same pay was to be found all over the claim. Q. Did he tell you how he was certain?\u2014A. He said that he was certain that the same pay was to be found from rim to rim. Q. Did he say what made him certain as to that?\u2014A. He said he had prospected the claim, so that he was certain. Q. What parts of it did he say he had prospected?\u2014A. He shewed us several holes that he had sunk on that ground. Q. Did he say what part of the claim he had prospected?\u2014A. Yes, he said he had prospected on the right limit and on the left limit; that is to say, from each side of the drifts worked at the time. Q. If he hadn't made these representations to you which you have stated would yon have purchased the property at any such price?\u2014A. No. Q. What did you rely on in making the purchase?\u2014A. I took his word. Q. As to what.?\u2014A. I took his word on what he said to me about the yielding of the property. Q. Did you make any examinations yourself?\u2014A. We went merely on the ground and simply I put down the explanation of Mr. Barrett except the occasion when I went to the drift, but we didn't examine drifts at all.' Asked by myself: 'Q. You tell me that you bought this property relying solely on the representations of Mr. Barrett?\u2014A. Yes. Q. And made no investigation either by yourself or by any other person on your behalf?\u2014A. No. Q. And depended entirely on the word of Mr. Barrett?\u2014A. Entirely; I have every confidence in Mr. Barrett.'\n\"These are the representations relied upon and this story is confirmed by Tarut, who was present with Paillard all the time. Barrett in reply denies this, and he is the only witness who can answer the defendants. He was asked: 'Q. Did you ever make any representations of that kind? A. There was something talked about it. They asked me if I thought the pay was as good on the creek as where I was working. I told them I had no reason to believe it was not as good because I did not know.' That is Barrett's answer to the direct evidence of these men. Let us consider the conduct of the parties; Paillard and Tarut certainly made no investigation as to the richness of the soil beyond panning or seeing the panning done of the dirt coming up from the then drifts. As to the balance or unworked portion of the ground, (which was really what they were buying, and not the holes which had been worked out) they made no investigation. Barrett had been on the ground since 1899. If any one knew it he should know it. This company was investing a large amount of money and claim ' 32 ' was supposed to be a rich one. Is it reasonable to suppose that these men would have bought the ground without some statement as to the possible richness of the undeveloped part? That Barrett did make some representation even from his own shewing is clear. He admits that he told them about two holes that he had sunk on the right and left of the old drifts. In one he swears that he told them that he got $25 in a rocking of an hour and a half, and in another that he got good pay. He did make these statements; he does not deny it; and he says that these statements were true, and that these are the only holes he spoke of except that he said that the pay which he got out of the old drifts which he had worked was good, and that he had worked the claim to a considerable profit. Barrett says that this was all he knew about the property and that it was all he said he knew; that he did not represent the pay as they said he did, to be good and equally good from rim to rim. He also says that he did not tell them the output of the various drifts, but that he did give them the output of some. I do not see why he should deny that because he threw open his books to them for inspection and prepared a statement as to the output. There was no reason why he should conceal the output of those drifts. It would be the most natural thing in the world for the syndicate to ask when investing this money what the output had been and what the previous profit had been. The question for me to determine is: Did Barrett make these representations or not, or did he simply say\u2014'From my knowledge of the ground I have reason to believe that the pay is good and will continue good?'\u2014which is practically what he says-' I told them I had no reason to believe it was not as good because I did not know.' The workings of the claim 32 are confined to the centre of the claim practically, and run up and down the valley, and are drifts 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9, which extend throughout the claim from end to end of a nearly uniform width of about 200 feet by 500, which is the length of the claim. These claims have been worked since the year 1898, and it strikes one as singular that the claim should be in this shape and that the working should be confined to the centre of the claim in this manner. It also strikes me as singular why the operations should stop, as they did stop, in a practically straight line up and down the claim, and did not branch off into the limits of the property. Barrett says, and some of his witnesses swear, that when they stoped on the edge of 3 and 2 and 6, the pay was just as good as the pay which they took out in any other part of the drift, that is, that pay did not get low and run out; and to explain why they ran up and down the creek instead of crosswise they say it would have been too far to wheel the dirt. Now, that is not a reasonable contention. We do not know where the shafts were, but supposing the shaft to be in the centre, then it was not harder to wheel the dirt from the side of the claim near the unworked portion to the centre than it was to wheel it from the end, nor as hard, and if the shafts had been at either end the same argument applies and is stronger. Looking at the operations, without any evidence at all, it strikes one that the pay gave out or became poor at the outer edges of those drifts, and with the evidence which was given I am convinced that that was the fact. Now, as to whether there is or is not pay outside of those old drifts, so far as the evidence given goes, one must conclude that there is no pay. The defendants after purchasing, worked out the, regular shaped drifts * * * at considerable loss; the pay was exceedingly poor; of that I have no doubt. It was in this vicinity that Barrett told them he sank the shaft which resulted in good pay. It is certain that if that is so the operations carried on by the defendants did not confirm Barrett's panning. As to the other side of the drifts\u2014the part lying below 3 and 7, we have evidence of nine shafts being sunk * * * and in some cases considerable drifting done from them. In none of these was pay got. By ' pay' is meant placer gold that will pay to take out, and certainly no such pay as was found in the old drifts worked was got in those prospecting shafts. * * * There is no evidence to rebut the positive evidence that in all these holes the pay was extremely poor, small pans being got and at other times not even colours. It was contended that the prospecting done as evidenced by these holes, is not sufficient to base any opinion on as to the value of the unworked ground. * * * While it is but barely possible that spots may be found containing good pay between these holes yet I am satisfied that the prospecting there done is sufficient to show that the placer gold in that part is not even and extensive and of the same grade and quantity as was taken out of the worked drifts. Wilkins, a very intelligent witness of large experience, says what he found he would not call pay at all. * * * Bell, another expert miner, confirms him. It is true that other witnesses\u2014Butler, a man also of large experience, says that he would not be satisfied with that prospecting, but would require to run drifts or tunnels between these various shafts so as to cross cut, and that pay might be found in that part which these shafts had not struck. No one denies that. It is possible that some pay may exist in spots between these shafts, but it must dodge around in a very curious manner to avoid all these shafts if it is there at all. Shafts were also sunk by laymen at E and D shown on the plan, and no pay found. Here we have both sides of the old workings explored, and so far as the explorations have gone (and they have been pretty general over the ground) no pay has been struck. I am of the opinion that for future operations claim ' 32 ' is worthless as a mining proposition\n\"Now, did Barrett know this? man was in a better position than he was to know it. \"Witnesses were called who had taken lays of this ground, and it is also proven that Barrett knew of these lays when they were granted. The laymen swear that the lays extended up the creeks from the lower part\u2014three 50 foot lays which would take in 150 feet of the claim and that Barrett must have known of the holes G, F, H, K and I, J. Barrett says he did not know of those shafts. It is hardly reasonable to believe that a man owning a property and being interested in it and knowing that lays were operated on it, and that the lays had been abandoned, would not make some in- quiry as to why they were abandoned, and would not know the result of the operations on this very ground of which he was the owner. It passes my comprehension and my belief that any one operating a mining claim would be so indifferent as not to know what the result of these laymen's operations had been. I believe that Barrett knew that this ground had been explored and was as it has turned out to be now. There is nothing to contradict his own story that he found good pay in three shafts that he sank * * * but if Barrett found good pay in those places then the subsequent operations made by the then explorers resulted differently. * * * Viewing all the circumstances, considering the fact that the syndicate made no investigation of the virgin ground, and that Barrett was in a position to know when they were not, I believe he made the representations which they say he made, and that he knew at the time he was making it that it was not correct. There is no doubt in my mind that these parties have been overreached, that they have acquired in '32' a practically worthless property. * * * These men say that they come from a country where business is not conducted upon these principles, where a man's word is taken. They say they were introduced to Mr. Barrett and met him several times at the house of Mr. Justice Dugas. * * * 'We did trust Mr. Barrett implicitly; we had been introduced to him by Judge Dugas, and it is a French custom when a high official such as Judge Dugas, one of the best men in the territory, introduces you\u2014it is French custom to believe in him entirely.' And they say throughout their evidence that they did trust Barrett because they found him as they say they did find him. It is not denied\u2014Barrett admits\u2014that a very great part of the conversations which were carried on were carried on in Mr. Justice Dugas' house. Now, I can conceive that these men, coming from a different atmosphere, and meeting Barrett as they say they did, would be inclined to believe in him, that any suspicions they might have would be lulled in this way, and that they were the easier taken in. It did not occur to them that Barrett might have been imposing on the good nature not only of themselves, but of the judge, and under the cloak of this good company he was endeavouring to unload upon them properties which he had worked out. In this connection * * *Barrett endeavoured to show that no property ever carried pay from rim to rim, and particularly that Dominion Creek could not, as it is spotty, and that any one who believed such a story would be foolish, and it is true that all the witnesses with one or two exceptions, swore that if any man told them a yarn like that they would not believe him. Wilkins, one of the main witnesses for the syndicate, said he would not take any man's word for any such statement, but Barrett himself says that he has known a claim with pay from rim to rim, and it would not be unreasonable to believe a man if he said so. This he modified afterwards on re-examination, when his counsel saw the effect of what he was saying, by saying that when he knew of claims containing pay from rim to rim he meant claims which had pay in spots from rim to rim, but not even an extensive pay. I agree, upon the whole evidence, that it is most unusual, in fact, exceedingly rare, to find any claim in the Yukon Territory which carries pay as represented ; that is, even and extensive pay from rim to rim, pay as a rule being found only in certain channels or spots on the claim, larger or smaller, but not at all, as a rule, spread over the entire claim, and I believe that any man having experience in the Yukon Territory would not have believed a person making such a statement without investigation. Now, as to the meaning of even and extensive pay, I take it that the impression which they then got, and which Barrett intended to convey, was that the pay in the portions of the ground unworked was of the same nature and extent as the pay in the ground already worked out, and that basing a calculation upon the result of the former works and the area of the ground unworked, a very large profit would result from future operations. Of course, when one would say ' even and extensive' it could not possibly mean that every pan would be alike; that is manifestly impossible; but it would mean that the pay over the whole ground would in the wash up average the same, and that the same pay would be found all over the claim. As to claims '9' and '12,' I have already touched upon '12' so far as the extent of the operations is concerned. As to the extent of the pay I do not find the evidence so clear on behalf of the defendants. They swear that Barrett told them that pay was good and that the claim could be worked to a profit and that the same pay would be found all over the claim as was found on the face of the hillside, and in the part already worked. Barrett denies this, and it is evident that some considerable panning was done on the hillside, and I do not think the representations are as clear cut in regard to this claim at least, or not sworn to as clearly as in the other\u2014'32.' In regard to '9,' the question of the value of the ground did not come up directly beyond the question of the output of a certain claim, and it is also confused, so that I cannot give any judgment or come to any conclusion upon the fact. I, therefore, do not find that the repre-sentations as to the extent of the pay have been proved in regard to these two claims and '12' hillside. Barrett says that he had worked the claim to a profit, but I cannot find that the representations were of the same direct nature respecting 12, nor as to 9, so far as the nature of the ground is concerned.\"\nThe learned trial judge in assessing damages continued as follows :\u2014\" There is also evidence that something was said of each parcel of four being valued at $35,000, and this claim No. 32, which I am considering, was taken at $35,000. That, I may say, however, was not definitely ascertained or sworn to, but some such conversation did take place. More than that, one Stearns was the owner of a half interest in this claim and that half interest was got in at $17,500 ; therefore the whole claim upon that basis would be worth $35,000. All these various pieces of evidence coming together would lead me to believe that the value fixed by Barrett to the knowledge of the syndicate, for this claim, in estimating the total value, was $35,000. The claim is now worthless. It could not be sold at all today for any money in my opinion. Will I assess the damages at $35,000, the price paid while allowing the defendants to retain? If revision of the contract had been asked for I have no doubt that would be the measure, less the profit derived from the claim. Now the syndicate have taken out a net profit from this claim of $13,317. Am I to allow this profit in estimating? If any other damage than the actual damage or loss sustained, in fact based upon restoration, would be allowed, then I may ignore the profit. The defendants also made a loss, but I think the net profit is $13,317. The question which is troubling me is\u2014shall I deduct the profit from that value? If I am to go upon the principle of allowing profit and loss from the various workings I will have to estimate the loss for the working of drift 9, that is, I will have to calculate the value of the ground taken out of that claim in excess of what was represented by Barrett to have been taken out and in all other parcels as well. But I have no means of ascertaining this without a reference. No evidence on the question of total profit and loss was given. If this property had been sold before or after the working of drifts '7' and '5,' which were made by the syndicate, what would it have brought if intending purchasers were ignorant of the result of the prospects made upon the claim which revealed its worthlessness? I cannot tell this and there is no possibility of ascertaining it now. On the whole I think I am justified in allowing as damages the full price paid for this claim at $35,000 as loss of bargain. If I should have assessed upon the other principle I now make the calculation in case I may be wrong. There should be allowed $35,000, less the net profit of $13,317, but adding to that the value of the ground taken out of ' drift 9 ' in excess of representation ; also the syndicate should have interest upon the balance of their money from the date of the purchase until judgment. Then, as to the balance of the damages, the only other claim against which I allow damage is claim No. 12, and that is for the Cassidy drift, known as drift 4. In this I have no trouble in coming to the amount of the damages. It is sworn that the total product was $11,000 from this drift, but that it was worked upon a lay, in which the laymen received fifty per cent, which was a fair allowance; therefore, the loss in this case is $5,500, which will be added to the other, making the total damages against the defendant Barrett $40,500. There will be judgment for the syndicate for this amount on the cross action.\"\nAnd directions were given as to the taking of accounts, etc.\nOn appeal to the full court the decision of the trial court judge was set aside by the judgment now appealed from and the syndicate's counterclaim against Barrett was dismissed with costs.\nThe questions raised upon the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nChrysler K. C. for the appellants.\nAylesworth K.C. and Ridley for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting.\u2014I unhesitatingly would dismiss this appeal upon the simple ground taken by the majority in the court below, that these appellants, assuming that their allegations of misrepresentation and fraud have been proved, have not proved that they have suffered any damages. No separate valuation was put upon these properties, and it is quite consistent with the evidence that the value of the properties purchased by the appellants, apart from \" Claim No. 32,\" exceeded the $167,500 they paid, and there is no evidence whatever as to the value of \" Creek Claim No. 12 \" at the time of the trial. Now, if the appellants got $167,500 worth of property or more, what damage have they suffered? The fact that they do not ask for the rescission of the contract would tend to indicate that they have not made such a bad bargain. I would also have found it impossible to reverse for the reasons that I gave in Kirkpatrick v. McNamee ([1]) upon an analogous appeal.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I would restore the judgment of the trial judge purely and simply, but as the majority of the court think that the amount of the damages should be reduced I will not dissent.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur generally in the judgment of my brother Nesbitt, and think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored subject to the variation hereinafter stated. The findings of fact of the trial judge should not, I think, under the circumstances, be reversed. A great deal depended upon the manner in which the witnesses gave their evidence and I do not find anything in the evidence which would justify me in reversing these findings. So far as they affect this appeal the learned judge found as a fact that the appellants' agents in the purchase of the properties bought by them relied upon the representations made to them by the defendant Barrett at the time the bargain was made and the purchase completed. He had the means of knowledge and they had not. They \"took his word about the yielding of the property\" and \"relied solely upon his representations\" as to that fact. The representations were as to '\"Plot 32\" substantially that he, defendant, was certain the same pay was to be found from rim to rim; that he had prospected the claim so that he was certain; that he shewed them several holes that he had sunk on that ground and that he had prospected on the right limit and on the left limit, that is to say, from each side of the drift worked at that time, and that if he had not made these representations to them they would not have purchased the property at any such price.\nThe learned judge found as a fact not only that these representations were made and that the purchaser relied upon them in purchasing the property, but that they were false to the knowledge of the defendant Barrett when he made them. The representations made with reference to the \"Cassidy claim. No. 4\" were also found by him to be false to the knowledge of respondent Barrett, and that the appellants relied upon them in making the purchase. That being so the action would lie for deceit and fraud and the question would then remain whether or not, the representations being false as to two of the properties purchased, damages could be recovered irrespective of the other properties included in the purchase and irrespective of the results or values which these other properties yielded as to which no false representations were made.\nThe learned judge found as a fact that in making up the total consideration for the entire property purchased there was evidence shewing the values which had been placed by the parties upon each of the two properties as to which false and fraudulent representations had been made with respect to their yielding qualities.\nOn this point the evidence I am bound to say is not as clear and conclusive as I could wish but I accept the finding of the trial judge as correct upon the point.\nThen, as to the measure of damages recoverable, it is clear that such damages must in actions for false and fraudulent representations not only be proximate but must be clearly defined and ascertained. All speculative values or damages must be excluded. The plaintiffs' loss is not in an action for deceit the value of his bargain. If the false statements relied on had not been made the plaintiff would have retained the consideration he paid but would have had nothing more, and the difference between that consideration and the actual value of the property represents all the loss that the defendants' wrong has caused.\nThe rule is laid down by Ch. J. Fuller of the Supreme Court of the United States in delivering the judgment of that Court in the case of Smith v. Bolles ([2]), who says:\nWhat the plaintiff might have gained is not the question but what he has lost by being deceived into the purchase.\nAnd further:\nWhat the plaintiff paid for the stock was properly put in evidence not as the basis of the application of the rule in relation to the difference between the contract price and the market or actual value but as estab- lishing the loss he has sustained in that particular. If the stock had a value in fact that would necessarily be applied in reduction of the damages.\nThis is also the English rule. In Peek v. Deek ([3]) Cotton L. J. said:\nThe damage to be recovered by the plaintiff is the loss which he sustained by acting on the representations of defendant. That action was taking the shares. Before he was induced to buy the shares he had the \u00a34,000 in his pocket. The day the shares were allotted to him which was the consequence of his action he paid over that \u00a34,000 and he got the shares. And the loss sustained by him in consequence of his acting on the representations of the defendant was having the shares instead of having in his pocket the \u00a34,000. The loss therefore must be the difference between his \u00a34,000 and the new value of the shares.\nIt is true that both the English and American cases were those of fraud in the sale of a chattel. But the reason of the rule must, I take it, be equally applicable to the purchaser of mining properties such as those here in dispute and would be the difference between the value of the property and the price paid. It has been so followed in the Federal Courts of the United States. See Alwater v. Whiteman ([4]); Glaspell v. Northern Pacific Railroad Co. ([5]).\nIn the case now before us the trial judge found that the price paid for the property \"No. 32\" was $35,000. He also found that the purchaser had before the trial realized a net profit from the working of part of that lot of $13,317, and that the property as it then stood after deducting that $13,317 was practically worthless. This net profit being deducted from the price paid would leave the damages on lot \"No. 32\" at $21,683 which was the actual loss or damage sustained by the plaintiff on that lot. Then, as to the damages on the other property \"Claim No. 12,\" for the \"Cassidy drift\" known as \"No. 4,\" he finds, on the same principle, the damages to be $5,500 which added to the $21,683 would make $27,183, for which amount judgment should be entered.\nNesbitt J,\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the very carefully prepared judgment of my brother Idington, and shall therefore content myself with shortly stating why I am unable to agree with his conclusions. I fully concur with his statement of the law as to what is necessary to be proved in an action for fraudulent deceit The learned trial judge, however, who had the law there fully argued before him, and was quite alive to the necessity of distinct proof of the various matters referred to by my brother Idington, has found in a very fully considered judgment against the defendant Barrett. He says that having in view the fact that the defendant made no investigation of the virgin ground\u2014\nI believe he (Barrett) made the representations which they say he did and that he knew at the time he was making it that it was not correct. There is no doubt in my mind that these parties have been overreached; that they have acquired in 32 a practically worthless property.\nIn dealing with the other claim \"12\" he goes into the evidence very fully and concludes that \"drift No. 4\" was not pointed out and further concludes that inspection would not have revealed the drift. The learned judge found the greatest difficulty in coming to a conclusion as to how he should assess the damages He finds that while the price agreed upon was $167,500 that in reference to \"32\" the result of the evidence is:\nThere is also evidence that something was said of each parcel of four being valued at $35,000. That, I may say, however, was not distinctly ascertained or sworn to, but some such conversation did take place. More than that, one Starnes was the owner of a half interest in this claim and that half interest was got in at $17,500; therefore, the whole claim upon that basis would be worth $35,000. All these various pieces of evidence coming together would lead me to believe that the value fixed by Barrett to the knowledge of the defendant for this claim in estimating the total value, was $35,000. The claim is now worthless. He then proceeds:\nIt could not be sold at all today for any money in my opinion. Will I assess the damages at $35,000 the price paid while allowing the defendants to retain? If revision of the contract had been asked for I have no doubt that would be the measure, less the profit derived from the claim. Now the defendant syndicate have taken out a net profit from this claim of $13,317. Am I to allow that profit in estimating? If any other damage than the actual damage or loss sustained, in fact based upon restoration, would be allowed, then I may ignore the profit. The defendants also made a loss, but I think the net profit is $13,317. The question which is troubling me is\u2014shall I deduct the profit from that value? If I am to go on the principle of allowing profit and loss from the various workings I will have to estimate the loss for the working of drift 9, that is, I will have to calculate the value of the ground taken out of that claim in excess of what was represented by Barrett to have been taken out and in all the other parcels as well. But I have no means of ascertaining this without a reference. No evidence on the question of total profit and loss was given. If this property had been sold before or after the working of drifts 7 and 5, which were made by the defendant company, what would it have brought if intending purchasers were ignorant of the result of the prospects made upon the claim which revealed its worthlessness? I cannot tell this and there is no possibility of ascertaining it now.\nOn the whole I think I am justified in allowing as damages the full price paid for the claim at $35,000 as loss of bargain. If I should have assessed upon the other principle I now make the calculation in case I may be wrong. There should be allowed $35,000 less the net profit of $13,317, but adding to that the value of the ground taken out of drift 9 in excess of the representation ; also the defendant company should have interest upon the balance of their money from the date of the purchase until judgment. Then, as to the balance of the damages, the only other claim against which I allow damage is claim No. 12, and that is for the Cassidy drift, known as drift 4. In this I have no trouble in coming to the amount of damages. It is sworn that the total product was $11,000 from this drift, but that it was worked upon a lay, in which the laymen received fifty per cent, which was a fair allowance; therefore, the loss in this case is $5,500, which will be added to the other, making the total damages against the defendant Barrett of $40,500. There will be judgment for the defendant syndicate of this amount on the cross-action, and there will be judgment for the bank, the plaintiffs, against the syndicate for the amount sued for by them, with costs.\nI think that the true rule is laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States in Smith v. Bolles ([6]), in the following language: He was bound to make good the loss sustained, such as the moneys the plaintiff had paid out and interest, and any other outlay legitimately attributable to defendants' fraudulent conduct, not the expected fruits of an unrealized speculation.\nAlso Mullett v. Mason ([7]).\nThe damages recoverable are such as result from false representations in so far only as the defendant is presumed to have known they were false. See Kerr on Fraud (3 ed.) p. 369.\nI think, therefore, that assuming $35,000 was the price fixed for thirty-two the plaintiffs are entitled to the actual loss suffered.\nIt was urged very strenuously that the rule laid down in Peek v. Derry ([8]), in the Court of Appeal in England, was the rule applicable here, and that plaintiffs were compelled to show that the balance of the property remaining in their hands was not of such value that no loss might ultimately be suffered. I do not think that this is correct. I think that as to the balance of the property, although the purchase money is a lump sum, as the trial judge has found, that, in making up that lump sum, thirty-two was taken at $35,000, that, in absence of proof to the contrary by the plaintiffs, it must be presumed that the representation as to the balance of the property was true and that the property is worth the price agreed upon between the parties and that as the plaintiffs could not claim for speculative profits in connection with it, so the defendant cannot claim that there may be speculative value over and above the value at which it was taken between the parties, and the plaintiffs are entitled by their bargain to any speculative values which may exist in the properties, or to any enhanced value which may arise after the sale. The defendant cannot claim these enhanced values as an offset to the damage arising from fraudulent representation in respect to a distinct and separate parcel. The price at which the property is sold is not conclusive as to its value though very strong evidence, and so thought Lord Denman in Clare v. Maynard ([9]), at page 743. Had the sale been of all the properties for a lump sum without referring to the price separate as to one of them I still think it is a question of evidence entirely as to damages suffered in respect of one parcel. It may be difficult of proof. It cannot be the law that if I purchase five undivided mining properties and in developing the first one at a large expense I find I have been swindled and an action of deceit lies against the seller that I cannot recover the damages I have suffered from such fraud in respect of that property. I think the rule would be in such a case that if I could prove what the fair proportionate value of such property was to the other properties included in the purchase, and so establish what my loss was in respect of that one, I am entitled I think to assume that the representations as to the others are correct and that there is no loss to me in regard to them. But surely I cannot be compelled at a vast expenditure of money to go on and explore these properties to shew that they too are worthless, or if I do go on and explore them and find speculative value in them that this can be set off against my loss on the one on which loss has been occasioned. I am entitled by my bargain to get the benefit of any such speculative values if they should be found. The seller cannot claim the benefit of them. He is entitled on the contrary, until his representations are proved to be false and fraudulent, to have it assumed that the properties are of the character represented, and if the true proportionate value can be established at which they were taken in making up the lump sum, then the difference between the true proportionate value and the lump sum which I have paid for the whole would be my actual loss by reason of the fraud in reference to one, if that one worthless. I could also add the legitimate expense I have undertaken by reason of the fraud such as was necessarily to be expected to be undertaken as attributable to defendant's fraud.\nMr. Aylesworth illustrated a case of purchase of fifty shares of stock in one company and fifty shares in another company and the purchaser retaining both stocks and bringing an action for deceit. One stock proved, at the trial, to be utterly worthless and the other to have risen largely in value since the date of the purchase. He claimed that as it was only the actual loss which could be recovered in an action of deceit, that the person committing the fraud was entitled to set off the loss arising from the worthlessness of one stock by appealing to the enhanced value of the other. I do not think this is sound, I think the purchaser is entitled to the benefit of his bargain of the fifty shares with all its possibilities and that the vendor is liable for the fraudulent deceit in reference to the other. We are not, however, in view of the trial judge's finding in this case, driven to solve this difficulty because he finds that \"claim 32,\" had a price set apart for it and we are able to arrive at the damage arising to the purchaser from the fraud which has been practiced. Apart from the question of damages I do not think we can, in view of the authorities, substitute ourselves in such a case as this for the trial judge, and I think that the findings of fact should not have been interfered with and they should be restored by this court. The memorandum book so much relied upon does not impress me in the same way as it has my brother Idington. The entries made in it are of an entirely distinct character from the representations relied upon.\nThe learned trial judge sat in appeal and after hearing full argument and the judgments of his brother judges he reiterates the view already expressed, and as it is peculiarly a case in which the local conditions of mining and certainly demeanor in the box plays such an important part I cannot feel that it is right for an appellate court to come to a conclusion that the trial judge was clearly wrong in his findings of fact. I would, therefore, restore the judgment with the variation suggested by my brother Davies.\nMr. Aylesworth also urged that as the counterclaim of the syndicate had been dismissed as against the plaintiffs no judgment could be given in the counterclaim against Barrett who has come in at the trial and consented to the case being gone on with against him. There is no direct authority I can find but it seems to me to be the better view that as the court was given jurisdiction by consent judgment can be entered. It may be that Barrett should be held to have nominated the trial judge the tribunal to dispose of the dispute between himself and the Syndicat in which case his judgment would not be appealable. See Attorney-General of Nova Scotia v. Gregory ([10]).\nI think the appellant is entitled to costs in this court and in the courts below.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014On the 23rd day of June, A.D. 1901, the defendant, the Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke, through its manager, L. Paillard, purchased from the defendant Barrett, one of the defendants by the original action, and defendant in the counterclaim, the following mining claims and machinery on same :\n1. Creek Claim No. 32, below Upper Discovery, on Dominion Creek; 2. Creek-Claim No. 12, above Lower Discovery, on Dominion Creek;\n3. Hillside placer mining claim opposite the upper half of No.12, above Discovery, on the left limit of Dominion Creek;\n4. Creek Claim No. 9, above Lower Discovery, on the same creek;\n5. Creek Claims, upper and lower halves of No. 2, Cariboo Creek;\n6. Hillside opposite the upper half of 28, on the left limit of Eldorado Creek;\n7. A one-fifth interest in about 150 claims on Barlow Creek.\nAlso a roadhouse or hotel on mining claim No. 36, below Upper Discovery, on Dominion Creek, and a stock of provisions and liquors as described in the chattel mortgage, Exhibit \"C\" (referred to in the evidence, page 22) at the price of $167,500, payable $75,000 in cash and the balance of $92,500 secured by mortgage and note.\nThe appellants having received conveyances of these properties entered into possession and worked part of the property. The Canadian Bank of Commerce, as holders of this note and mortgage, sued appellants on the 16th May, 1902, therefore, and they set up fraud, and by a counterclaim that raises in effect an action of deceit, sought to recover from the bank and the respondent Barrett, damages arising from this deceit Barrett was not thus brought into the suit until the trial when he at once, upon amendment being directed and allowed, pleaded to the counterclaim denying the alleged fraud.\nAll other questions and issues are now out of the case and the counterclaim dismissed as to the bank. The trial judge, while dismissing the bank, found against Barrett in respect of four out of a much larger number of alleged misrepresentations which he was charged with making.\nThese findings are not literally as alleged, though said to be founded upon those set out in the pleadings. The appellants' factum summarizes them as follows:\n(a.) That with regard to Creek Claim No. 32, below Upper Discovery, said defendant Barrett had prospected the claim all over;\n(b.) That the pay-streak on said claim was even and extensive extending from rim to rim, and the said Barrett guaranteed that it was as good in the part unworked as in the part he had worked out himself, and that, by reason of his knowledge of what it contained and calculating upon the area worked by him, it would yield profits exceeding $400,000.\n(c.) That, for the purpose of prospecting said claim, he, Barrett, had taken out a small drift at the upper end towards the left and that the ground taken out of said drift would not exceed 900 superficial feet.\n(g.) That, excepting certain specified work, no work had been done on the upper part of Creek Claim 12.\nTo appreciate the evidence in support of these findings, we must bear in mind that fraud is proved when it is shown that a false representation had been made knowingly, or without belief in its truth, or recklessly, careless whether it be true or false, and that to prevent a false statement from being fraudulent there must always be an honest belief in its truth. Moreover, in an action of deceit, The plaintiff cannot establish title to relief simply by showing that the defendants have made a fraudulent statement; he must also show that he was deceived by this statement, and acted on it to his prejudice. To be a ground for an action of deceit the false statement must be material. It is an inference of fact, not of law, that the representation was the inducement. It is not sufficient defence to prove that the person deceived made some investigation into the facts.\nThe appellants were represented in the transaction by Paillard, and for the purposes of considering the evidence, and indeed the whole case, I will deal with him as if he were a party. He has stated what induced him to enter into the contract as follows:\u2014\nQ. What was the figure?\u2014A. The figure we agreed upon was $167,500.\nQ. What induced you to come to such an agreement and give such price?\nA. Because he represented to us that the claims were pretty good, that it was a good investment and that, for instance on 32, I would get as much in proportion as he had taken out before, that the claim 32 would yield a profit of $400,000, that the expense would not be over 40 per cent of the gross output; I said to him several times that I relied entirely upon his word. At another time he stated:\nQ. Did you rely upon yourself for any facts at all?\nA. No, I took only the figures of Mr, Barrett, that is all. I could rely only on those figures.\nIt will be observed that in these two statements there is no distinction attempted to be drawn between the representation as to the figures and the representation or representations that I may refer to as of a general character, speaking in regard to the value or supposed value of the investment. It is necessary to bear this in mind in considering Exhibit \"F 3,\" which contained memoranda made at the time in Paillard\u2019s notebook. This notebook is referred to by Paillard in his evidence as follows:\nQ. Did you make any other investigation on 32?\nA. We went all over the ground and we asked Mr. Barrett the parts worked out and not worked out.\nQ. You asked him as to the parts worked out, and did he give you any measurements?\nA. He gave us a measurement.\nQ. I think you told my learned friend that you put that down carefully in a memorandum book?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Everything he said to you about the measurement?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Everything he told you about the quality of the ground?\nA. Yes. .\nQ. And in fact everything he said from the time you went there until the purchase was concluded was kept track of?\nA. Not perhaps everything.\nQ. Everything of moment V\nA. Yes.\nQ. You carefully put that down in a memorandum book?\nA. Yes.\nQ. With what object did you do that?\nA. It was to have an idea of the ground worked out in that claim, to see how much ground was left to work, and to see how much that claim had yielded, and to see how much it would yield.\nHe says the entries thus made on this note book were made at the time, standing upon the property that was being bargained for, and in the course of the talk he had with Barrett in relation thereto.\nIt strikes me as most singular that in these memoranda there is not to be found a single reference to any one of the grounds upon which the misrepresentations are now rested.\nI have no doubt that Paillard got all that appears in Exhibit \"F. 3\" for the express purpose of testing the value of the property and forming from that his own judgment, and that he discarded as of no consequence what he was told, if ever told, about even and extensive continuation of the same rich products from rim to rim; the $400,000 prospective profits; the 30 x 30 feet at foot of No. 9 shaft; Barrett's assertion of having prospected all over, and the materiality of that now raised as to numbers 3 and 4, the products of which might have come out of one shaft as well as two.\nThe commendation and all that bears that character is left out of the note book. What one expects a prudent man to have noted is noted, and what a business man of that kind would discard has been discarded. It destroys by what it includes, and what it omits, the theory now put forward by Paillard of his having relied entirely on these representations now in question.\nThe excuse is given that Paillard did not put down those because they did not deal in quantities.\nThe quantities given were but the means of testing the quality of the property.\nWhy should express representations of quality in such a case be omitted if stated and relied upon?\nThe excuse given does not appear to me well founded. The manner of making the representations stated by Paillard and the circumstances of giving them are stated as follows: Q. What occurred when you went to him?\nA. Mr. Barrett showed us the properties; he took us on the ground.\nQ. What ground first?\nA. First, he took us on 32 below upper; I requested him to make a plan in order to understand better his explanations, and he said it was better to see, on the ground itself; he showed us the part worked out and the part that was left to be worked; and he gave us the figures for each and every drift; I put them on my memorandum at the same time.\nQ. What did he say, if anything, as regards the drift of 32?\nA. For each drift he gave me the figures of the output of that drift, and he said that the same pay would be found all over the claim.\nQ. What figures did he give you?\nA. He gave me several figures, one for each drift.\nAnd again:\nQ. Did he state to you at any time how he arrived at the knowledge that 32 was a claim that would yield such enormous profit?\nA. He said that judging from the amount of gold he had taken from those drifts, and being certain that the same pay was to be found all over the claim.\nQ. Did he tell you how he was certain?\nA. He said that he was certain that the same pay was to be found from rim to rim.\nQ. Did he say what made him certain as to that?\nA. He said that he had prospected the claim so that he was certain.\nQ.What parts of it did he say he had prospected?\nA. He showed us several holes that he had sunk in the ground.\nQ. Did he say what part of the claim he had prospected?\nA. Yes, he said he had prospected on the right limit and on the left limit, that is to say, from each side of the drifts worked at the time.\nQ. If he hadn't made these representations to you which you have stated would you have purchased the property at any such price?\nA. No.\nQ. What did you rely on in making the purchase?\nA. I took his word.\nAgain (p. 100):\nQ. Coming to the particulars of the alleged misrepresentations, we will take up the first one, that is A., respecting creek claim 32; did he show you the holes on the claim?\nA. He showed us some holes; yes.\nQ. Did he show you all the holes that you have on this plan, Ex. \"H. 2\"?\nA. No; all the holes that are on that plan were not there at the time.\nQ. Did he show you all thus holes that were there at the time?\nA. He showed me several holes; I don't know if they are all on this plan or not. Q. Can you point out any holes on this plan that were there at the time he showed you?\nA. I can mention the holes that are on this plan that he showed us.\nQ. I want to know if there are any holes on that plan which were there at the time that he didn't show to you?\nA. I don't know if there were more holes that he didn't show me because there were some tailings on the ground.\nQ. Have you any holes marked on that plan as being there at the time when you made the examination which he didn't show you at the time?\nA. I don't see any.\nQ. Well then, when you say prospected all over, you mean that he said that he had sunk these holes?\nA. He said he had prospected the claim all over.\nQ. And he showed you the holes that he prospected?\nA. He showed me some of them, but I don't know if he showed all the holes that he had sunk because there was some tailings.\n(P. 102):\nQ. You say in item B, of your alleged misrepresentations that calculated by the area it would yield $400,000; that is 32?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did he absolutely guarantee to you that?\nA. He said he was sure the pay would yield a net profit of $400,000 according to what he had and that he was sure the pay was the same on the balance of the claim; he said he was certain.\nQ. How could he be certain?\nA. I don't know; he said he had prospected all the claims so that he knew pretty well what was in that claim.\n(P. 122):\nQ. Have you any entry in your memorandum book with regard to the representation which you say Mr. Barrett made that the claim would yield you a profit of $400,000?\nA. No.\nTarut, the assistant of Paillard, who went with him, says, p. 124:\nQ. For what purpose did you go?\nA. We went at that time for examination of the claim.\nQ. After you got there what did you do?\nA. Mr. Barrett took us over the ground and showed us all the limits of the claim, his plant, and gave us every opportunity about seeing the claim.\nQ. Well, what claims were talked of, if any?\nA. He took us the first to 32 and Mr. Paillard requested him to make a sketch of the claim. He said that he was not able to do so, but that he would give Paillard full information and then Paillard wrote down the information and made a sketch according to his statement.\nQ. Where was this done?\nA. This was done on the ground, on 32.\nQ. Do you remember what was said by Barrett as to 32?\nA. He told us that the pay was even from rim to rim; that he had prospected the claim all over and had ascertained this fact, and he showed us an old shaft where he had taken out $25 in an hour and a half from rocking; this was close to the right limit in the upper part of the claim. On the right limit he showed us a hole where he had found good pay.\nQ. Did he say anything further as regards the claim?\nA. He gave us the output that had been taken out for each drift.\nAnd, p. 125, after stating quantities taken, he is asked:\nQ. Anything after that?\nA. After that he said the area of what was worked on the claim, and for drift No. 1 we estimated, according to his statements, that there was 2000 square feet worked out.\nWhat is meant by the term \"prospecting,\" so frequently used by these gentlemen? What did Paillard think it meant? Did he not take it to mean what he had been shown there, the tests put before him? It is not said by Paillard that he understood it in any other sense. It ought not to be taken in any other sense than what any person of ordinary intelligence standing where they stood on the property, going from one hole to another on it as they did, seeing what could be seen there, measuring results as given and noted down, might, when such a phrase was used, reasonably he expected to intend it to mean.\nBarrett was speaking of and in relation to this very means of exploration of which Paillard was taking notes. The meaning of prospecting here is not what others might think or attach to it as a generic term or descriptive of the exceeding care that a cautious man might use for himself to test such property. The evidence relating to that and that kind of work was, I submit, beside the question and misleading. It seems to me that the learned trial judge did not correctly appreciate the evidence\nListening to witnesses explaining what was not for the purpose then in hand a technical term shows this. This is not a case for rescission, where it might be possible to conceive of this language having led to such misconception as to entitle one who did not really understand it to relief.\nIt is an action of deceit of which the very essence is that there should be no doubt of what the speaker intended and the listener understood by the language used.\nIs it not a most remarkable feature of the case that this man who is charged with fraud has not in a single instance of those numerous and important specific statements set down as from him in this note book, been proven to have made in regard to any of them a single false statement?\nIs it not equally remarkable that such proof failing it is sought to rest the charge of deceit on evidence of conversations which all authority warns against as fruitful of errors? Misunderstanding of each other's meaning in conversation and the possible faults of memory at the end of two years as to the exact language used, render it dangerous to try to so fix upon any one a charge of fraud.\nThe learned trial judge infers from the knowledge Barrett had that he knew a great deal more than I can find the evidence as showing he knew or pretended he knew.\nThere may be much ground of suspicion that the pay-streak in the main drifts had been so rich that Barrett was afraid the rest would not prove as fruitful as that had so far been. We must have much more than suspicion, we must have clear proof of it, or facts from which we cannot infer anything but fraud, before we can act. We cannot infer it from the results here in so hazardous and uncertain a business as mining.\nThe fact that the learned trial judge allowed himself for an instant to impute to Barrett the knowledge before the sale of the results derived from digging the holes G. F. H. K. and IJ, which were dug after the sale tends, I submit with every respect, to deprive his judgment of that weight which it is usual to give to the trial judge's opinion.\nThen, did Paillard rely upon these representations now relied upon? The learned trial judge says:\nAt first I was amazed that the men should have believed, as they say they did believe.\nWith great respect I am unable to understand how he ever got rid of his first impression. The story of Paillard relying entirely on these alleged unnoted misrepresentations is exceedingly improbable. Consideration of this point is of importance in a twofold aspect. If the stories were not relied on then there is no ground of action. And if they are incredible or improbable that tends to discredit the man who says he did rely on them. Take the one that \"the claim 32 would yield a net profit of $400,000.\" This property was one of four (included in this sale) that the man so implicitly relied on put before the witness Paillard as of an equal value, and on this basis he furnished equally good expectations to the witness of realizing $1,600,000, and this Barrett was giving away for $167,500, and the gentleman of education, who had been in Dawson City in the Yukon on mining business for two years previously to receiving this tale, swears he believed and relied upon it and was induced thereby to enter into this contract. And he believes all that from the mouth of a man who was a comparative stranger.\nI call attention the more readily to all this in weighing Mr. Paillard's evidence, because I find him by the following evidence telling something that a regard for his own honour ought to have seen put right by the end of this trial; (p. 93):\nQ. And did you receive a letter in reply?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Where is that letter?\nA. That letter is lost.\nQ. You received another letter about this too?\nA. Yes.\nQ. That met a like fate?\nA. That was lost too.\nQ. And they were burnt?\nA. No, not that I know of.\nQ. You have an office on the claims out there?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Some place to keep documents?\nA. Yes, we have an office.\nQ. These letters disappeared almost immediately after you received them, didn't they?\nA. No.\nQ. We hadn't them on the 14th October, the time the examination was held?\nA. Yes, I could not find them at that time.\nQ. When did you receive them?\nA. I think I received the first of them in the beginning of September.\nQ. The examination was held on the 18th October?\nA. That may be. I don't remember.\nQ. These letters were valuable papers, were they not?\nA. I didn't consider them.\nQ. They referred to a large transaction?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And I suppose they contained the commendation or blame of you entering into this large transaction?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And yet they disappeared?\nA. They were mislaid.\nIf he relied on what he now is said to have relied on, the correspondence with his principals would have shown it and been quite clearly admissible to refresh his memory, if on no other ground.\nIt is not the case of the destroyer of the documents, so there is in law possibly no legal presumption against him. But the principle lying at the bottom of that rule may as matter of reason be well applied.\nI have dealt with the case as we, I think, ought to regard it from the salient points of view. We have to determine whether or not the court below were right in overruling the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nThough I have not here set out an analysis of the evidence in detail I have read everything, including not only that referred to by the factums but also all that which in the case is presented on behalf of the appellants, and much of it many times, and find nothing sufficient therein to correct or change, but rather on the contrary to deepen, the general impressions received and presented above.\nWhen one approaches the other evidence from the point of view I have taken in regard to Mr Paillard I think there can be no doubt, in the absence of a report to the contrary expressly discrediting the witnesses testifying against him, that the evidence they gave is entitled to equal credibility with that of Mr. Paillard or any other, and the weight of evidence manifestly is thus found against the appellants. The main claim of misrepresentation thus falls to the ground, and the others I think must go with it.\nFor example, I find Paillard thought at one time after investigating the matter that the so-called 30 x 30 feet area which is spoken of as the excavation of No. 9, was much less than about one half what he now alleges. As to that matter there is not any reliable basis for saying more than that probably the area exceeded 30 x 30 feet somewhat, but how much, or how much at least, is not shown. The story as to Cassidy and his work, and whether there were two shafts or one seen or shown, does not seem to me of much importance. Pail lard at any one time after discovering these things did not seem to attach more importance to them than as being probable mistakes. It was by dwelling upon the extravagant meaning attached to the word \" prospecting \" that seems to have led to the fundamental error in this case of imputing to Barrett a representation he cannot necessarily be said to have intended, and then imputing to him a knowledge that he is not shown to have possessed or to have pretended to possess.\nAnd the basis for the assessment of damages for $35,000 is thus gone. That being the case, I need not dwell upon the features of the case in which the further sum of $5,500 is allowed. Not only does it fail by reason of the weight of evidence being against it, but the principle upon which such assessment was made is, I think, entirely wrong. This brings me to the question of damages, which I need not in the view I take decide, and say upon what basis they should be assessed. I am quite clear that they have been assessed upon an entirely erroneous basis. The plaintiff in an action for deceit is entitled only to such damages as he can show he has sustained. This contract was not a joining of a number of sub contracts together resulting in a total, but was one entire contract for the block sum already stated Whatever Barrett may have\" thought or said, Pail lard expressly discards any other way of looking at the matter at the time of the bargain than as a complete whole. His company may not have been damnified a single cent. We have not the evidence upon which, whatever may be the correct legal method of assessing damages in this case, we can apply successfully the legal principle that only for such damage as the appellants sustained could they recover damages here. They had a very obvious remedy in rescission if, when their suspicions were first awakened, they had taken steps to that end. They had done no more than in the case of The Lindsay Petroleum Co. v. Hurd ([11]). The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Bleecker & O'Dell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Pattullo & Ridley.\n[1] 36 Can.

Mr. Justice Sedgewick, after hearing the parties, refused the leave asked for. The applicants now move for leave to appeal from that refusal.\nThis application is opposed on the part of the Grand Trunk Railway Company on the ground that no appeal lies from Mr. Justice Sedgewick's order.\nWe are of the opinion that this contention must prevail and the application must be refused. The judge to whom the application is made would not have the power to refer it to this court. A statutory enactment of this nature cannot be extended by interpretation. Jurisdiction is conferred upon a judge to grant or refuse the leave to appeal, as a persona designata, but not to the court. Whether he gives leave or refuses it, the right to apply for leave is exhausted.

It is also provided that if the mortgaged goods are removed into another district a certified copy of the mortgage shall be filed in the registry office thereof within three weeks from the time of removal otherwise the mortgage shall be null and void as against subsequent purchasers, etc.\nHeld, reversing the judgment in appeal, that the \"subsequent purchaser\" in such case must be one who purchased after the expiration of the three weeks from time of removal, and that though no copy of the mortgage is filed as provided it is valid as against a purchase made within such period.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe defendant Hulbert was mortgagee of chattels under a mortgage from one McDonald and had registered his mortgage in the District of Edmonton. Mc- Donald removed the mortgaged goods into the District of Calgary and, within three weeks from the time of such removal, sold them to the plaintiff Peterson. Some two months later the defendant Hulbert sent his co-defendant Worth, a bailiff, to seize the goods. Worth took them out of plaintiff's possession, and the latter brought an action for conversion, in which he obtained a verdict for $125.\nAfter the removal of the goods into Calgary District, Hulbert failed to comply with the provision of the Ordinance requiring a certified copy of the mortgage to be filed within three weeks, and his mortgage became void as against the plaintiff, provided the latter was a subsequent purchaser under the Ordinance.\nThe court below held that subsequent purchaser in the Ordinance meant a purchaser subsequent to the removal and not subsequent to the expiration of the three weeks within which the copy must be filed.\nBeck K.C. for the appellant, having stated the point in issue the court called upon counsel for respondent to maintain the judgment appealed from.\nMasters K.C. for the respondent. Registration Acts were passed to prevent frauds arising from mortgagors retaining possession of mortgaged property, and should be construed strictly. Boulton v. Smith ([1]); Harding v. Knowlson ([2]); Olmstead v. Smith ([3]).\nThe cases relied on by the dissenting judge below and by appellants in their factum of failure to renew a chattel mortgage on expiration of a year from registration and a purchase within the year are distinguishable. They were decided entirely on the ground of notice and that the purchaser merely replaced the mortgagor. Hodgins v. Johnston ([4]) is one of those cases. The other, Clarke v. Bates ([5]), has no application. That was a case of removal under a statute in the same terms as the Ordinance in this case, but it was decided on the ground that the goods were removed by a stranger and not by the mortgagor.\nEven in case of failure to renew a mortgage a purchase within the year has been held good. McMartin v. McDougall ([6]); Courtis v. Webb ([7]); Boynton v. Boyd ([8]).\nIn Clarkson v. McMaster ([9]), this court held that where by statute possession of mortgaged chattels would not validate a mortgage void for want of registration as against creditors becoming such before possession taken, the mortgage remained void as against those becoming creditors after possession.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSedgewick J.\u2014The defendant Hulbert was mortgagee of the goods in respect of which this action was brought. The mortgage is dated the 18th April, 1902, and was registered in the office of the Registration Clerk for the Edmonton Registration District on the 28th day of April, 1902. About three months later the mortgagor removed the goods to the Calgary Registration District. Within three weeks after such removal he sold the goods in the latter Registration District to the plaintiff. About six weeks after the sale, the defendant Hulbert, hearing of the removal and sale, took the goods from the plaintiff, whereupon he brought this action for the conversion of the goods. The mortgage was never registered in the Calgary District.\nThe only question involved in this case therefore is: Was the plaintiff's title subject to the defendant Hulbert's mortgage?\nSection 29 of the Bills of Sale Ordinance provides:\nIn the event of a permanent removal of goods and chattels mortgaged * * to another registration District * * a certified copy of such mortgage * * shall be filed with the registration clerk of the District to which such goods and chattels are removed, within three weeks of such removal, otherwise the said goods and chattels shall be liable to seizure and sale under execution, and in such case the mortgage shall be null and void as against subsequent purchasers and mortgagees in good faith and for valuable consideration as if never executed.\nThe case was tried before Sifton C.J. who gave judgment for the plaintiff and this judgment was affirmed on appeal by the Supreme Court of the Territories, Scott J. dissenting.\nWe are all of opinion that the appeal must be allowed, because in our view the expression \"subsequent purchaser\" in the section just quoted means a purchaser after the expiration of the three weeks specified as the period within which the mortgagee must file his mortgage. During those three weeks he had all the rights with the common law and the Bills of Sale Ordinance secured to him, and any dealing with them by the mortgagor was in violation of or repugnant to those rights within that period and absolutely unavailing as against the mortgagee. We therefore think that the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed, the whole with costs, the costs in the courts below to be taxed according to the proper scale.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Rutherford & Jamieson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: MacDonald & Griesbach.\n[1] 17 U.C.Q.B. 400 ; 18 U.C.Q.B. 458.\n[2] 17 U.C.Q.B. 564.\n[3] 17 U.C.Q.B. 421.\n[4] 5 Ont.

Wordsworth v. Barley (1 B. & Ad. 391); Lord Oakley v. Kensington Canal Co. (5 B. & Ad. 138); and Whitehouse v. Fellowes (10 C.B.N.S. 765) referred to.\nIn the present case, the permanent character of the damages so caused could not be assumed from the manner in which the works had been constructed and, as the nuisance might, at any time, be abated by the improvement of the system of operation or the discontinuance of the negligent acts complained of, prospective damages ought not to be allowed, nor could the assessment, in a lump sum, of damages, past, present and future, in order to prevent successive litigation be justified upon grounds of equity or public interest. Judgment appealed from reversed, the Chief Justice and Girouard J. dissenting. Fritz v. Hobson (14 Ch. D. 342) referred to. Careau v. The Montreal Street Railway Co. (31 Can. S.C.R. 463) distinguished. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench ([1]), appeal side, reversing, in part, the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, (Fortin J.), and increasing the damages claimed by the action of the plaintiffs, with costs.\nThe action was instituted in December, 1902, by the proprietors of property in the vicinity of the power house of the Montreal Street Railway Company, in the City of Montreal, and alleged that the company constructed immense works and installed heavy machinery therein, in 1893, for the operation of their system of electric tramways; that since then the company added to the constructions so erected and increased the power of their machinery, particularly during the years 1896 and 1897, and since that time; that the machinery has been and still is in operation both day and night and constitutes a continual nuisance and source of injury to the owners and tenants of the property in question, and renders the buildings thereon erected uninhabitable. The action claimed damages (a) for depreciation in value of the land, $3,233,(b) for loss of rent since 1893, $800, and(c) for inconvenience, diminution in the enjoyment of the property, troubles and damages generally caused to the dwellings, $1,500, making a total of $5,333, damages past and future claimed on account of the continuing nuisance resulting from the operation of the defendants' works.\nBy their defence, in addition to pleading the general issue, the company specially denied that any depreciation in value had taken place and that if any depreciation had taken place it was not their fault; alleged that the property is situate in a manufacturing district and was, when the power-house was constructed, unsuitable for residential purposes, and that if the plaintiffs or their tenants have suffered inconvenience it is only what should be reasonably expected in view of the nature of the locality and the character of the buildings in the vicinity; that the company's buildings and the work carried on therein are proper and suitable to the locality, necessary for the purpose of carrying out the objects of public convenience for which the company was incorporated, lawfully erected in a skilful and proper manner in virtue of the powers, franchises and privileges conferred upon the company by law, and could not constitute grounds for a claim for damages, nor are they a nuisance to the neighbouring proprietors; that the operations are carried on with due and proper care; and they further pleaded prescription.\nThe case was tried without a jury by Mr. Justice Fortin, who maintained the action in part only, holding that the defendants had caused to the plaintiffs, by the operation of their power-house by vibration, smoke, soot, etc., certain damages, which he estimated and fixed at 300 for the two years preceding the institution of the action. The remainder of the claim was disallowed on the grounds, (1) that any damages suffered more than two years before the institution of the action were prescribed, and(2) that no permanent damages or damages to be suffered in the future could be allowed as the defendants might, at any time, discontinue their operations or so modify them as to put an end to the inconvenience complained of. Judgment accordingly went for $300 and costs.\nThe plaintiffs appealed from this judgment with the result that the court of appeal increased the damages awarded to $1,500, the reasons given being that the defendants had abused their rights to the detriment of the plaintiffs and caused them inconvenience exceeding what a neighbour is required to endure; that this violation of the rights of neighbourhood (droits du voisinage) continued from 1893 to the time the action was instituted, and that under the circumstances, prescription under art. 2261 C.C., did not apply, and that defendants' establishment was of a permanent character which had the effect of unduly depreciating the value of the plaintiffs' property. The court then proceeded to declare that it was in the interest of the parties to settle once for all and definitively, both for the past and for the future, the damages resulting from the operation of the defendant's power-house, fixed the amount of the damages so suffered at $1,500, and gave judgment for that increased amount with costs.\nFrom this judgment, the present appeal is taken by the defendants who submit that the judgment of the Superior Court should be restored.\nCampbell K.C. and Hague for the appellants. The court below in assessing damages and including future damages due to the assumed permanency of the nuisance complained of did not frame the judgment on the principle of Gareau v. Montreal Street Railway Co. ([2]) in such a way as to render that judgment, if accepted, a final settlement of all damages. On the contrary it gave respondents $1,500 unconditionally and simply upon their action as brought, that is to say for the damages suffered. The conclusions are, thus, inconsistent with the reasons upon which the judgment is based. It appears also from the special reasons given by Lacoste C.J. that the appeal court disagreed with the Superior Court on the question of prescription, on the ground that the nuisance was continuous and, so long as it continued, prescription did not run; and, on the question of future damages, distinguished this case from Drysdale v. Dugas ([3]) in which no future damages were allowed. The learned Chief Justice explains that the $1,500 was made up of $ 1,000 for depreciation in the value of the property, and $500 for loss of rent and general damages, but that the court purposely awarded a lump sum in order to leave more latitude in the event of the case being carried further.\nIn the first place the appellants take issue on the plaintiffs' title to the properties in respect of which damages are claimed. At the time of the action the plaintiffs had merely a right of redemption in this property, having sold it \u00e0 droit de rem\u00e9r\u00e9 several months previously. This constituted complete alienation, subject to the condition, and divested the plaintiffs of any right to the present action: Arts 1546, 1547, 1553, 1554, 1560 C.C.; Bourque v. Lupien ([4]); Lamontagne v. B\u00e9dard ([5]) Salvasl; v. Vassal ([6]).\nThe evidence does not justify the claim that the value of the property was depreciated owing to the vicinity of the power-house and the finding of the trial judge in this respect should not have been interfered with, and nothing should be awarded for depreciation in values as a result of the construction and operation of the power-house. It appears that the character of the locality, having been always more or less a manufacturing district, is now becoming entirely so, and consequently the houses are becoming less desirable to tenants as the result of such changed conditions and neglect to keep the buildings in proper repair. The question of depreciation is purely a matter of fact, as to which the trial court should not be reviewed by a court of appeal. Cossette v. Dun([7]) per Gwynne J. at page 257; Gingras v. Desilets([8]); Ryan v. Ryan([9]) per Gwynne J. at page 406.\nThe trial court allowed no future damages. The appellate court has, however, taken them into consideration. In this they were clearly in error. The court cannot adjudicate beyond the conclusions: art. 113 C.P.Q.; Cheveley v. Morris([10]); Watkins v. Morgan ([11]). No future damages were claimed; the claim was confined to damages actually suffered at the time the action was taken, and plaintiffs' counsel strenuously objected to evidence of any facts subsequent to that time. There is nothing in the judgment appealed from to prevent a fresh action for continuing the alleged nuisance. It is an unconditional absolute award beyond the conclusions of the declaration, and, as such, clearly irregular and ultra vires.\nEven if future damages had been prayed for they should not have been awarded. If damages were suffered, they resulted not from the construction or existence of the power-house, but from the operation of the machinery. In Drysdale v. Dugas ([12]) such damages were refused, and there is no reason in the present case to adopt a different rule. The appellants were clearly within their rights in building the powerhouse and in installing machinery therein. The only complaint can be that they have been operating their machinery in such a way as to interfere with their neighbours' rights. If they have done so it is the negligent or wrongful method of operation and not the mere operation of the machinery (per se a lawful act) which is the sole cause of the damage complained of. The court had no right to presume the continuance of wrong-doing, nor the infliction of injuries in the future. Art. 1053 C.C. makes no provision for anticipation of damages that might occur in the future even from the same cause of action. It is clearly impossible for any court to say what future conditions will be. The nature of the locality may change irrespective of the presence of the powerhouse; the operations may, at any time, be discontinued or so modified as to do away entirely with complaint. The methods adopted in modern machinery are constantly changing, and there is no reason why the court should assume that the present conditions will be eternally the same. The permanent character of the buildings and the length of the charter have nothing to do with the question. In Carpentier v. Ville de Maisonneuve ([13]), the nuisance complained of was from an establishment for supplying electric light; the court refused to assume that the nuisance complained of would be permanent. In France future damages are sometimes allowed, but always on condition that the actual state of things continues and with the reservation that the parties are always free to ask that the amount of the damages be increased or reduced. 6 Laurent, No. 152, p. 207; Pand. Fr. Rep. \"Etablissements dangereux,\" No. 688-689; Dalloz, Supp., \"Manufactures,\" No. 88; 4 Aubry & Rau, No. 308. Even assuming anything to justify condemnation in respect of future damages, the court of appeal has neglected to avail itself of the conditions and restrictions which the jurisprudence of France so reasonably requires. If the power-house were to cease to exist or to cease operations to-morrow, appellants will have compensated respondents, in advance, for purely chimerical damages based upon mistaken anticipations.\nIn respect of any damages suffered more than two years before the action was taken the two years' prescription under art. 2261 C.C. must apply. Whatever damage was done was the result of acts the time of which was certain and fixed before the action was taken. The damages for loss and general inconvenience were fixed and certain then, and the damage which subsequent acts of negligence might cause was entirely distinct and as such constituted a new cause of action. Kerr v. The Atlantic & North-West Railway Co.([14]), per Taschereau J.; Breakey v. Carter ([15]). Two years before the present action was instituted the respondents might have sued for loss of rent and inconvenience to the extent of the damages which they had then suffered for two years before, and which they are now including in this action. Surely, having neglected to take the action then, they are now debarred from their right under art. 2261 C.C. The damages may be of the same nature, but they are not the same damages. See also Wilkes v. Hunger ford Market Co. ([16]).\nMignault K.C. and Lamothe K.C. for the respondents. As the defendants did not appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court decreeing their responsibility, the only questions which can arise under the present appeal are: First, Was the action prescribed as to any damages suffered more than two years previous to its institution? Secondly, Have the plaintiffs the right to claim damages for permanent depreciation of their property and buildings? We will therefore not refer any further to the question as to title nor discuss whether the defendants are in law responsible for damages caused by vibration, noise, etc., inasmuch as they have not appealed, and because this point has been conclusively settled by Gareau & The Montreal Street Railway ([17]) and The Montreal Water and Power Company v. Davie (2).\nAs to the contention of the appellants that they are exercising powers conferred upon them by their charter of incorporation and are exempt from liability for damages caused thereby, see Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy ([18]); Royal Electric Co. & H\u00e9v\u00e9 ([19]); Montreal Water and Power Co. v. Davie([20]). If this ground was a good defence surely they should not have acquiesced in the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe damages suffered cannot be prescribed under art. 2261 CO., which establishes a prescription for damages resulting from offences or quasi-offences. The damages in the present instance resulted from a continuing cause, and from a violation of the law of neighbourhood, and being, as such, damages due under a quasi-contract rather than by reason of \u00e1 d\u00e9lit, the prescription applicable to offences and quasi-offences could not apply. Where the cause of damage is a continuing one damages for the whole period during which the cause of damage has existed can be claimed. Kerr v. The Atlantic and North-West Railway Co. ([21]); The Town of Truro v. Archibald ([22]); R\u00e9p. g\u00e9n. jur. Belge, vo. \"Prescription,\" No. 59; Sourdat, \"Responsabilit\u00e9,\" vol. 2, No. 1485; Grenier v. City of Montreal([23]); Bell v. Corporation of Quebec ([24]); Robert v. City of Montreal([25]); Beauchemin v. Cadieux ([26]). This is an implied quasi-contract whereby each proprietor obliges himself to so use his property as not to damage his neighbour's, and. damages resulting from the prejudicial use of his property are not subject to the prescription of two years under art 2261 CO. which applies to d\u00e9lits. See Breakey v. Carter([27]); Pothier, 2nd Appendix to the Treatise on Partnership, Nos. 230, 241 (ed. Bugnet, vol. 4, p. 330, No. 235); Baudry-Lacantinerie, \"Biens,\" No. 217; \"Propri\u00e9t\u00e9,\" No. 223. The appellants claim that they have exercised every precaution in installing their machinery; they deny that they have been guilty of any fault, but assert that they have only exercised their rights. Under these circumstances, if they are responsible for any damage by reason of the use they make of their property, and their responsibility is now res judicata, they cannot claim the benefit of the two years' prescription affecting offences or quasi-offences, the first characteristic of which is the illegality of the act complained of. Consequently the claim was not barred by prescription of two years, and the plaintiffs are entitled to claim all damages suffered by them from the time of the establishment of the power-house down to the institution of the action. The Court of King's Bench was clearly right in considering the power-house as a permanent institution. The depreciation caused to the property is of a permanent nature, and there is no hope of the property ever regaining its former value. We are entitled to damages for inconvenience or loss of enjoyment, and also to damage resulting from the depreciation of the property itself, and from the impossibility of disposing of it. All our rights of property, the rights of enjoyment, use and disposal, have been affected by the power-house, and the depreciation being an actual fact all damages can be recovered. See Dalloz, Supp., vo. \"Manufactures, fabriques et ateliers,\" Nos. 86, 88, 176; Req. 8 mai 1850, Affaire Cartier ([28]); seq. 20 f\u00e9vrier 1849, Affaire Desrone ([29]); Paris, 18 mai 1860, Affaire Robin ([30]); Dalloz, Supp. vo. \"Propri\u00e9t\u00e9,\" No. 70; 2 Aubry & Reu (5 ed.) p. 307, par. 194; Clerault, des \u00e9tablissements dangereux, ch.

Tipping ([31]); Baltimore & Potomac Railroad Co. v. Fifth Baptist Church([32]).\nThe Court of King's Bench has considered it in the interests of the parties to put an end to any further litigation, and granted $1,500.00 for all damages, past, present and future, including the depreciation of the property and the loss of the enjoyment and use of the same, following Gareau v. The Montreal Street Rail-way Co. ([33]). The appellants acquiesced in a condemnation of $300 for two years, and consequently every two years they can be called upon to pay a similar sum. The only difference between the parties now is $1,200, which will put an end to further litigation and cover all damages. This judgment was most fair and equitable for all parties, and the respondents are willing to accept this award in final satisfaction of their claim.\nThe Superior Court concluded that no damages beyond two years preceding the action, or of a permanent character could be granted, and did not pass upon the evidence relating to depreciation of the property, or to loss of enjoyment. Consequently the Court of King's Bench was the first to pass on this evidence. That court made a most careful study of the evidence and, in its opinion, this evidence is stronger than the evidence in the Gareau Case([34]). That finding is fully justified by the evidence, and should not be interfered with on appeal.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I dissent from the judgment of the majority of the court for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Girouard.\nGIROUAIRD J.(dissident).\u2014Tout en partageant l'opinion de M. le juge Fortin qu'une r\u00e9clamation comme celle des demandeurs se prescrit par deux ans, aux termes de l'article 2261 du Code Civil, je suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que la cour pouvait et devait m\u00eame mettre fin au litige tant pour le pass\u00e9 que pour l'avenir.\nL'\u00e9tablissement de l'intim\u00e9e, qui est la cause des dommages, a \u00e9t\u00e9 construite \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, et fait m\u00eame partie de l'immeuble; art. 377, 379, 380 C.C.; et il est raisonable de consid\u00e9rer la cause des dommages comme permanente. Cette r\u00e8gle de droit s'impose comme n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la situation; sans elle, le propri\u00e9taire serait sans rem\u00e8de efficace. Par example, veut-il vendre pendant la dur\u00e9e de la nuisance qui est cause du dommage \u00e0 sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9? De suite, il subit une diminution du prix proportionnelle au dommage souffert. Pour lui ce dommage se fait sentir d'une mani\u00e8re permanente et c'est de cette mani\u00e8re que les tribunaux doivent l'appr\u00e9cier.\nIl n'y a aucun texte de loi qui s'oppose \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision. Il y a de plus une grande raison d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public de l'adopter; elle tend a emp\u00eacher la multiplicit\u00e9 des proc\u00e8s. Je concours pleinement dans le judement de la cour d'appel et particuli\u00e8rement les motifs suivants:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que l'\u00e9tablissement de l'intim\u00e9e a un caract\u00e8re de permanence, ce qui influe davantage sur la valeur actuelle de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des demandeurs et la d\u00e9pr\u00e9cie notablement;\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'il est de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des parties de r\u00e9gler une fois pour toutes et d\u00e9finitivement tant pour le pass\u00e9 que pour l'avenir, les dommages qui r\u00e9sultent de l'exploitation de l'usine de l'intim\u00e9e;\nConsid\u00e9rant que les dommages s'\u00e9l\u00e8vent \u00e0 la somme de $1,500.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in the reasons stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Nesbitt.\nNESBITT J.\u2014In this case the plaintiffs sued as proprietors of a property contiguous to the power-house of the company alleging that owing to the negligent operation of the company's works damage was suffered.\nThe trial judge held that the plaintiffs were limited to the recovery of damage by the prescription of two years under art. 2261 of the Civil Code and could not recover for permanent damage. The Court of King's Bench held that the prescription did not apply and also assessed damages as for a permanent injury and gave a sum to represent the damage once for all.\nIn my view, the action was one for tort and the negligence gives rise to a continuous series of torts which can be brought to an end by the defendant discontinuing the act and is within the article of the Code referred to, and the damages prescribed by two years' limitation.\nThe power-house of the defendants is on their own land and its operation is the cause of the tort to the plaintiff and cannot in the eye of the law be recoggarded as permanent no matter with what intention it is built. The work is done by public authority but so negligently as to cause injury to the plaintiffs and it is to be supposed will be remedied and the plaintiffs, therefore, can recover only for loss to the date of the tort, although in one case where the nuisance was abated before the trial the damages, on the ground of convenience, were assessed up to the time of the abatement of the nuisance. See Fritz v. Hobson([35]); Wordsworth v. Harley([36]); Lord Oakley v. Kensington Canal Co. ([37]); Whitehouse v. Fellowes([38]).\nIn the case of works authorized by law, where the power of expropriation is given upon due compensation, the rule has grown up of assessing the damages once for all, since the work complained of is assumed to be permanent and the defendant would have the right to erect the works complained of upon setting the necessary machinery of the law in train. In the case of trespass upon the plaintiff's land where, to remedy the wrong, another trespass would have to be committed, the injury is not continuing but inflicted once for all and full compensation is to be recovered in one action and so in actions of personal tort causing injury to the person. I think, therefore, the course pursued by the court below, while calculated to put an end to successive litigation and in the interests of the parties, was not justified and the judgment of the trial judge should be restored with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The learned trial judge, properly as I think, disallowed respondent's claim for past damages beyond the time limited by art. 2261 of the Civil Code.\nHe also refused, I think properly, to allow prospective damages.\nHe omitted making any allowance for damages to the buildings or to the property itself as reduced in value by anything that happened up to the time of the action being begun and, in this respect, he may possibly have erred.\nIt is impossible, considering the way in which the evidence has been given, to form a satisfactory opinion as to what damages may have happened to the property within the two years preceding the action. If these damages should, in the judgment of the respondents, be substantial, I think, in the result I am. about to state, they should have an opportunity of having such damages assessed in respect of the causes of action confined to the two years in question and beyond the damages which the learned trial judge has allowed here for the loss in respect of the use or current enjoyment of benefits or profits from the use of the property during the said two years.\nThe Court of King's Bench, in appeal, has estimated damages upon a basis that includes prospective damages. It is possible, on the evidence, to arrive at a reasonable amount on that basis if prospective damages are allowable for the evidence was given looking to that result. I am of opinion, how-ever, that, in allowing prospective damages, the appellate court has erred.\nHolmes v. Wilson ([39]) decided that an action for \"keeping and continuing a buttress\" on the land of another after the recovery for the trespass of erection can be maintained.\nThompson v. Gibson([40]) seems expressly in point, for there it was held that an action for continuing a nuisance will lie. Numerous cases are cited. Some of them go to shew that the assignee of the property could bring an action even though he might have the right to abate the nuisance. This was in 1841, for damages to a market by the erection of a building.\nBattishill v. Reed([41]) illustrates the damages that might be allowed for injury to the property and admits and approves the principle upon which the foregoing cases rested. The action was brought by a reversioner only and he was restricted, therefore, to the amount actually necessary to be spent upon the structure to remove the cause of offence.\nBankart v. Houghton ([42]) was a case where judgment was recovered at common law and then a bill filed to restrain execution thereof and also future actions on the ground of acquiescence. The motion was dismissed, the court holding that acquiescence could not be relied on as an answer to damages.\nIn Backhouse v. Bonomi([43]) it was held, relying upon these cases and others, that the action for future subsidence could only be bound by the lapse of time from the subsidence, though the excavation causing it had occurred long before. It seems to be conclusive as the judgment of an appellate court of high authority in every respect upon the point of the right to bring the action accruing from the time the damage happens. That seems to involve all the other questions in dispute in this case in relation to the assessment of damages.\nMitchell v. Darley Mayne Colliery Co.([44]) reiterates all this, reviews the authorities again, overrules Lamb v. Walker([45]), and leaves the law, I think, as I have just stated it.\nHole v. Chard Union([46]) in the Court of Appeal decided that a nuisance from a sewer created continuing damages and gave actions in the future but the difficulty was overcome there by means of the order xxxvi, R. 58, which provides that:\nWhere damages are to be assessed in respect of any continuing cause of action they shall be assessed down to the time of the assessment.\nThis reiterates the law, shews the modification by apt legislation in England, which we have not got here, to apply to the cases under consideration.\nI am constrained to hold, therefore, to the opinion that there cannot in law be any assessment against the will of the parties in regard to prospective damages that will bind all concerned and protect the company against future claims.\nIf we could import as a principle of action the method adopted in France, as shewn by the authority quoted from Laurent, we could meet these cases admirably. In the absence, however, of legislation I do not see how that can be done here. It seemed to be conceded in argument that such is the case. But this was attempted to be met by treating the establishment of the works as permanent, which, as to the location of this power-house in question creating the nuisance, I do not find to be the case.\nGareau v. The Montreal Street Railway Co.([47]) does not seem to aid us except in recognizing the rights of the respondents to recover damages flowing from the vibrations complained of as produced by appellant's machinery.\nThis court there suggested an amount that would be proper to allow and that was acceded to by the parties appellant there. What was suggested in argument here as a proper disposition of the rights of the parties, following the lines of that case, might well be worth the parties' while considering, but I fail to see how we can impose our will upon them in the present state of the law.\nI would prefer to allow a new trial to enable respondents, if they should desire it, to establish substantial damages to the structure for the two years before their action, but, as that seems impossible, I agree that the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, in appeal, should be reversed, and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants : Campbell, Meredith, Macpherson & Hague.\nSolicitor for the respondents : J.

In an action by M. against S. for waste by cutting wood on said fifty acres the defence set up was that by parol agreement in consideration of S. conveying one hundred acres of his land to W. he was to have a deed of the fifty acres, and having so conveyed to W. he had an equitable title to the latter. M. admitted the agreement but denied that the land to be conveyed to S. was the said fifty acres.\nHeld, per Nesbitt an\u00e0 Idington JJ. that the conveyance to W. was a part performance of the parol agreement and the statute of frauds was no answer to this defence.\nThe majority of the court held that as the possession of the fifty acres was referable to the lease as well as to the parol agreement, part performance was not proved, and affirmed the judgment appealed from in favour of the plaintiff (37 N.

DAVIES J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. The questions involved are largely those of fact. The trial judge has found them in plaintiff's favour, and the Court of Appeal in Nova Scotia has confirmed his judgment. The evidence is very confused and in the important points almost directly conflicting. As the trial judge says:\nThe whole difficulty between father and son has so obviously grown out of family feuds and constant litigation that little credit can be given to anything they say, and in the absence of written evidence no legal effect in my view could be given to the defence set up.\nOn such a finding by the trial judge as to the credibility of the parties and their evidence it would require a very strong case indeed to justify this court in reversing his conclusion, confirmed as it is by the Provincial Court of Appeal. Mr. Borden felt this difficulty but contended that the trial judge had misapprehended the evidence as to the defendant's possession of the seventy acre lot in dispute, and that his judgment was formed on that misapprehension. For my part I am quite unable to see that there was any such misapprehension. His conclusions were reached by rejecting the evidence of the defendant and accepting that of the plaintiff and his witnesses, and I incline to the opinion that he was right.\nThe facts, so far as I have been able to extract them, are that the father was at one time the owner of a considerable block of land and entered into a family agreement in writing with his two sons, Samuel, the defendant, and William, under which the lands were apportioned between them as tenants from year to year of their father, conditional on their providing for the maintenance and support of the old man and his wife.\nUnder this family arrangement the seventy acre lot became William's, as tenant. The defendant admitted cutting the trees complained of but contended that he had become the equitable owner of this seventy acre lot by virtue of a parol agreement made between himself and the plaintiff, his father, whereby, in consideration of his conveying 100 acres of land previously conveyed to him by the father to his brother William, the plaintiff agreed that he should have the use of the lot in question in all respects as owner, and that he would give him the title by will at his death. He contended that he had conveyed the 100 acres to William, had entered into possession of the seventy acres under the parol agreement with the father, and that there having been part performance of the agreement his equitable title was a good defence to the action.\nThe father on his part utterly denied the existence of any such agreement, but admitted that he was to give Samuel fifty acres of land somewhere if he would convey one half of his 300 acre lot to William which he denied was done. William, the brother, on the other hand says that Samuel, the defendant, went into possession of the seventy acre lot under an agreement of exchange with him whereby it was provided that Samuel was to convey to William \"one half of the land he owned between the two rivers\" estimated to contain about 300 acres, and William was to assign to Samuel his interest in the seventy acres. William says,\nhe, Samuel, was to have the use of it the same as I had. He was to rent the same as I did. It was not the understanding that he was to have the use of it in father's lifetime and have it willed to him. He was to have the use of it. The time was up every year.\nIn order to successfully maintain his defence and defeat the operation of the Statute of Frauds it was essential that defendant should have proved part performance of the alleged verbal agreement by which he was to become the owner of the seventy acres. Has he done so? The trial judge held he had not because his possession was as clearly referable to the lease of that seventy acres from the father to William, and of which leasehold interest Samuel had become the assignee (if William's version was accepted) as it was to the alleged verbal agreement between the father and Samuel.\nThe defendant could only succeed, and that was fully recognized by his counsel, by showing that the acts relied upon by him as part performance were unequivocally and in their own nature referable to some such agreement as that alleged by him. Maddison v. Alderson[2]. In my opinion he has signally failed to do so. His possession of the seventy acre lot, to put it at the highest for him, is as clearly referable to the exchange of lands testified to by William and under which Samuel became the tenant of his father of this lot as it was to the alleged verbal agreement of which Samuel testified. I must say that I concur with the trial judge in thinking the former theory to be the correct one.\nThat being so there was no part performance of the alleged agreement even if one could accept the vague and unsatisfactory evidence of Samuel as to its existence.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nNESBITT J.\u2014The plaintiff, Jacob Meisner, the father of William, Samuel and Stephen Meisner, was apparently the owner of a considerable tract of land.\nIn November, 1886, he conveyed a parcel of land to the defendant Samuel Meisner which I gather was then assumed to contain about 150 acres. In November, 1888, a lease was executed between the father and Samuel and William of the homestead together with stock and implements. This lease expressly excepted 50 acres of the homestead from the portion to be rented to Samuel, and expressly leased said 50 acres to William. In the view I take of the document I think this 50 acres about which the dispute has arisen is, for the purposes of this suit, to be treated as if it had been leased by a separate document to William. In October, 1893, Samuel conveyed to William 100 acres, part of the parcel conveyed in 1886 by the father to Samuel. The father now sues Samuel for cutting wood on the fifty acres or seventy acres which was exclusively leased to William in 1888. Samuel sets up as a defence that he is entitled to cut this timber on the ground that by a bargain between himself and his father he, at the request of the father, conveyed the 100 acres in 1893 to his brother William; that William then gave up possession of the fifty acres and Samuel went into possession of it and has cut wood from time to time; and that the father agreed that if he would give a deed to his brother of the 100 acres, he, the father, would give the defendant the exclusive use and enjoyment of the seventy acres as his own during the father's life time and give him a title of the seventy acres by his will.\nThe trial judge found against the claim of the son and such finding has been affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and we are pressed with the argument that this court should not disturb a mere finding of fact in which both the courts below have concurred.\nSo long as an appeal lies to this court on questions of fact I think we cannot decline the duty of forming and expressing our own judgment, bearing in mind, however, the considerations so fully referred to by Lord Davey in Montgomerie & Co. Limited, v. Wallace-James[3], at pages 82 and 83. I have the less hesitation in this case because it is apparent that the trial judge was influenced in his decision by the view which he held that he was not entitled to draw any inference from the fact of finding the defendant in possession of the seventy acres, because, he said,\nhis acts of possession, in the absence of corroborative evidence as to the agreement, must be referred to the lease under which he had the right to enter on this lot for ordinary purposes but not to cut timber on it.\nThis same error runs still more strongly through the judgment of the Court of Appeal which makes a full collection of cases to shew that no evidence to contradict or vary the terms of the lease could be given by the defendant, cases having no bearing unless the court assumed the defendant was entitled to possession by virtue of the lease. I have already pointed out that the lease expressly excludes this fifty acres from its provisions and expressly gives the exclusive possession to William Meisner. It is quite clear that if the evidence convinces us that the possession of Samuel Meisner at the date of the litigation is to be referred to a subsequent arrangement such as Samuel alleged, that then the father cannot succeed in this action of waste and the statute of frauds is no answer to the defendant. Samuel swears expressly to the bargain\u2014I give a short extract of his evidence:\nMy father said if I would give Willie a deed of 100 acres between the two rivers that he would give me the seventy acre lot and at his death I was to have a title of it. It was to use it as my own. That was before I gave the deed. I gave the deed to Willie. There was no objection to it from my father or from Willie from that time until this trouble arose. Since I gave the deed to Willie I have cut logs on the seventy acre lot. I have cut pine, spruce, hemlock and hardwood. That is before this last time. My father knew I cut. The seventy acre lot was surveyed twice. It was surveyed just before I gave Willie the deed. Father and William got it surveyed. I did not get the deed from my father at once after I gave the deed because he said he would not put it out of his hands; he would give me the land and after his death I would get the title of his will.\nThe father admits that he requested the defendant to give William a deed and admits that he was to give a deed of some land but denied that it was the fifty acres, and says that he has not yet made up his mind what land it will be; he says:\nI cannot tell when the deed was given by Samuel to Willie, I did not read it, it was read to me.\nThe brother William says:\nSamuel gave me a deed. I put it on record. I did not pay Samuel anything for it.\nThe brother, however, says that the defendant was to simply take his place as tenant in the fifty acres and he could be turned out at any time, his time was up every year. He also says, referring to the seventy acre lot,\nyes, he was to have the use of it if he gave me one-half of what he had between the rivers, I had the use of the seventy acre lot before that.\nThis seems to make it plain that Samuel's possession is to be referred to the bargain, not to the lease. This is the fact on which both courts erred.\nStephen Meisner, another brother, called as a witness, swears:\nFather complained to me that Samuel was stripping that land. I said, well, did not Samuel get that land from you? Does he not own it? Did he not give William the 100 acres of land between the two rivers for a place over on the side of the river? And he told me, yes, but Samuel did not give the 100 acres, only part of the 100 acres. * * * * He said when Samuel gave William the 100 acres he was giving him the seventy acre lot. He said Samuel gave William a deed of part of the 100 acres but not the whole.\nSamuel Robar, a neighbour, states that the father told him substantially the same. Thomas Acker, another neighbour, states that three years before the trial he asked the father for liberty to cut hemlock trees upon the lot and in reply he said he could not as it belonged to Samuel. It is true the father denies that he made these statements, but the story of the father that the defendant was to give the deed of 100 acres to his brother, and that he was to give a deed of some fifty acres not mentioned seems incredible, more particularly as the defendant, apparently immediately after the conveyance by him to William of the 100 acres, for the first time went into the exclusive possession of the fifty acres and apparently exercised the usual rights of ownership from time to time from 1893 down to 1902, without objection by the father. Nobody other than William Meisner made any suggestion of an execution of the deed of 100 acres for a mere yearly tenancy which William enjoyed of the fifty acres, which bargain, if made, would of course account for the possession of Samuel. Apart from the possession of the seventy acres I think the execution by Samuel of the conveyance to William of the 100 acres, which was executed on the faith of the father's promise, was an act of part performance taking the case out of the Statute of Frauds. In the matter of Estate of Earl of Longford; In re Cook's Trustee's Estate[4]. See Lincoln v. Wright[5] as to the defence of Statute of Frauds. I do not intend to prejudice the position of any of the parties in any action of specific performance. Different considerations may arise there, as for instance the father's statement that Samuel had not conveyed all he agreed to which if found to be the fact might influence a court in its decree in such an action. I would allow this appeal with costs in all the courts.\nIDINGTON J. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wade & Paton.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McLean & Freeman.\n[1] 37 N.

Judgment appealed from affirmed, Nesbitt and Idington JJ. dissenting.\nBy a clause in a contract for the construction of works, the completion thereof was undertaken within a specified time and in default of completion as stipulated it was agreed that the contractor should pay \"as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, the sum of fifty dollars for every subsequent day until the completion.\"The works were not completed within the time limited, and, in consequence, both parties joined in a petition to a municipal corporation for extension of the time during which subsidies it had granted towards the cost of the works could be earned. The petition was granted and the works were completed within the extension of time allowed by the corporation.\nHeld, Nesbitt and Idington JJ. dissenting, that damages accruing under the clause in question did not, upon mere default, become sufficiently liquidated and ascertained so as to be set off in compensation against a claim upon a promissory note.\nHeld, per Girouard and Davies JJ. (Nesbitt and Idington JJ. contra), that by joining in the petition for extension of time the party in whose favour the penal clause might take effect had waived the right to claim damages thereunder during the period of the extension so obtained in the interests of both parties to the contract. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, by which the plaintiffs' action was maintained with costs.\nThe Dominion Bridge Company, respondents, brought the action for $4,571.65 on a promissory note made by the railway company, appellants, for the balance due the bridge company on a contract between the Ottawa and Gatineau Railway Company, the Pontiac and Pacific Railway Company and Horace Jan-son Beemer, of the one part, and the said bridge company, of the other part, whereby the bridge company agreed to supply, build and erect the metal superstructure of the interprovincial bridge across the Ottawa River between the City of Ottawa and the City of Hull.\nThe railway company contested the action and, among other defences, pleaded that, under the contract, the bridge company had undertaken that the works would be fully completed in August, 1900, but had failed to finish their part of the works within the time limited and did not complete them until sometime in January, 1901; that by a clause in the contract, in case of such default, it was stipulated that the bridge company should pay \"as liquidated and ascertained damages for such default, and not as a penalty, the sum of fifty dollars for every subsequent day until the completion of the said bridge superstructure\"; that the default continued for 155 days, and, thereby, there became due by the bridge company in virtue of said clause, to the defendants, $7,750.00 as damages, liquidated and ascertained, still owing and unpaid, at the time of the action, and which the defendants offered, pro tanto, in compensation against any sum that might be due to the plaintiffs. The defendants, however, did not set up this claim for damages by a cross-demand.\nThe respondents met this plea by three objections: First, that the appellants had not alleged that they had suffered any damages by the delay; Secondly, that the superstructure and piers which the railway companies and Beemer had undertaken by the first contract, were to be fully completed on the 1st of September, 1899, and that this work was not completed until November following, and that, having themselves been the cause of the delay, the penalty clause cannot be enforced; Thirdly, that both appellants and respondents had subsequently joined in a petition to the Council of the City of Ottawa (which had granted subsidies for the construction of the bridge, provided it was completed and opened to the public on or before the 9th of September, 1900) to extend the time during which the subsidies could be earned and received; that, consequently, the penalty stipulated had failed by reason of such petition, and that the appellants had, by waiver as well as by acquiescence in the respondents' acts, lost the right to enforce the said clause respecting damages.\nThe Superior Court condemned the defendants to pay the $4,571.65, with interest, and rejected the defendants' plea setting up the claim for liquidated damages in compensation.\nThe defendants appealed to the Court of King's Bench, which affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court, four of the judges affirming on the sole ground that the debt offered in compensation was not claire et liquide, sufficiently liquidated, and, therefore, could not be offered in compensation; the fifth judge, Blanchet J. differing from the majority on this point and being to confirm on the sole ground that the appellants had renounced their right to claim liquidated damages by joining in the request with the bridge company to the City of Ottawa for an extension of the time of the earning and the payment of the subsidies. The majority of the court, in referring to this ground taken by Mr. Justice Blanchet, were of opinion that the acts recited were not a renunciation.\nThe questions raised on the present appeal sufficiently appear in the judgments now reported.\nCampbell K.C. and K. R. Macpherson for the appellants. Notwithstanding the strict words of art. 217 C.P.Q., compensation takes place by the sole operation of law, and the issue is properly raised by simply pleading it. Arts. 1076, 1188 C.C., arts. 3,203 and Sch. E. 4, C.P.Q. In this case, which fulfils all the requirements of the articles of the Civil Code, just cited, the damages sought to be set off, although not absolutely claire et liquide, are so easy of proof that they fall within the principle laid down in Hall v. Beaudet ([1]); Duguay v. Duguay([2]); Ross v. Brunet([3]); De-cary v. Pominville([4]). This is also the doctrine of the French law: 2 Pothier, No. 628; 28 Demolombe, Nos. 522, 523, 524, 525; 18 Laurent, No. 405; Merlin, Rep. de Jur. vo. \"Compensation,\" para. 2, No. 1; 4 Aubry & Eau, p. 227. The clause of the contract is a liquidation of the damages exempting the railway companies from any proof as to the amount, and leaving it only necessary for them to establish the number of days during which the works remained incomplete. See also Kneen v. Mills([5]); Mignault No. 5, p. 424; Delorimier No. 8, p. 347; 3 Larombiere, art. 1231; 6 Toullier, Nos. 813-814. In McDonald v. Hutchins([6]), cited by Blanchet J., it was held \"that no evidence was permissible or required to prove damages resulting from the inex\u00e9cution of an obligation within a specified time where these damages have been agreed upon by the parties to the contract at a certain stipulated sum or rate per day.\"\nThe defendants were, consequently, within their rights in pleading compensation and set-off, and there was not, in this case, any necessity of filing a cross-demand. Whether the opinion of the majority of the court below on this point is technically correct or not, it is within the power of this court, the whole merits of the contestation being now before it, to define and determine the respective responsibilities of the parties, and to declare the plaintiffs' claim compensated, and no ends of justice will be served nor principles of law vindicated by refusing the claim of the appellants and forcing them to prolong this litigation by an independent action.\nThe plaintiffs were not delayed or inconvenienced in any way by any act or default of the defendants in respect to the completion of the portions of the bridge to be constructed by the railway companies: Holme v. Guppy([7]); Bettini v. Gye([8]); Graves v. Legg([9]); The completion of the works by the railway companies was not a condition precedent: Wheelton v. Hardisty ([10]).\nThe application for extension of time for the completion of the works was proposed and carried out by the plaintiffs. The railway companies only joined in it because they were forced to do so in order to avoid large pecuniary loss by the forfeiture of the subsidies. There was no waiver either express or implied, and although Blanchet J. quoted authority for his opinion, it was not shared by the majority of the court be- low. That defendants never waived their rights is abundantly clear from the evidence of the plaintiffs' engineers and one of the directors that the works to be performed by the railway companies could have been completed within the time specified in the original contract and in time to earn the subsidies, even though the extension had not been granted.\nGormully K.C. and Cross K.C. for the respondents. It is clear that, the number of days during which the default continued being disputed, the alleged penalty is not a debt certain and demandable and does not possess the essential characteristics of a claim which could be set off against a claim due under a promissory note. Arts. 1178, 1188 C.C.; Art. 217 C.P.Q.; Pothier, \"Obligations,\" No. 628; Mourlon, No. 1442; 16 Laurent, No. 304; Dalloz, 96, 2, 180; Finnie v. City of Montreal ([11]); Pand. Fr. vo. \"Obligation,\" Nos. 5692, 5693, 5701, 5703, 5709. The penalty is not exigible because of the appellants' own default, or rather, because of the default of the persons with whom respondents contracted to comply with their precedent or reciprocal obligations under the contract to complete their share of the bridge work within the time limited. Holme v. Guppy([12]). Moreover, they joined in the petition to the City of Ottawa for an extension of the time fixed for the completion of the works and, thereby, lost the right to enforce the penalty, by acquiescence in the modification of the contract whereby the necessity of completion of the works within a specified time ceased. The application was acceded to; the bridge was completed at a later date and the bonuses were secured and paid. Under these circumstances there was failure of the consideration for which the penal clause was stipulated, and both contracting parties having secured the benefit of the bonus, the benefit which in the very words of the contract it was the object and intention of the parties to secure, the appellants cannot now claim the penalty in addition. Dalloz Rep. supp., vo. \"Obligation\" Nos. 665, 1594, 1619; Dalloz, 79, 1, 122, notes 1 and 2; 54, 1, 288; Dodd v. Churton([13]); Kerr Engine Go. v. French River Tug Co. ([14]); Pand. Fr. vo. \"Obligations\" No. 2562; Rolland de Villargues, vo. \"Clause p\u00e9nale\" Nos. 49, 50.\nThe claim for damages cannot, in any event, be set off under a plea of compensation. Such damages can be recovered and set off only upon a cross-demand filed according to the provisions of articles 203, 215 and 217 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This has not been done, and, consequently, compensation cannot be declared by the court.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014Je renverrais cet appel sur le motif donn\u00e9 par la cour du banc du roi que la cr\u00e9ance de l'appelante n'\u00e9tant pas claire et liquide ne peut \u00eatre oppos\u00e9e en compensation de celle de l'intim\u00e9e et qu'elle ne pouvait d'ailleurs \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9e dans l'instance que par une demande reconventionnelle. L'article 217 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure ne me para\u00eet pas laisser de doute sur la question, et, comme le remarque le savant juge en chef de la cour du banc du roi, la jurisprudence en ce sens est maintenant fix\u00e9 sur la question. GIROUARD J.\u2014Je serais port\u00e9 \u00e0 croire, avec la majorit\u00e9 de la cour d'appel, que, dans les circonstances de cette Cause, la compensation des dommages liquid\u00e9s ne peut avoir lieu sous l'empire du nouveau code de proc\u00e9dure civile (art. 217), sans former une demande reconventionnelle, surtout lorsqu'il y a objection de la part du d\u00e9fendeur. Mais je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re renvoyer l'appel avec d\u00e9pens pour le motif adopt\u00e9 par M. le juge Blanchet. Pour les raisons qu'il d\u00e9veloppe, je n'ai aucune h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 conclure avec lui qu'il y a eu prolongation du d\u00e9lai stipul\u00e9 pour l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux, \u00e0 laquelle l'appelante a non seulement acquiesc\u00e9, mais qu'elle a demand\u00e9 elle m\u00eame pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de toutes les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es\u2014 elle m\u00eame comprise.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The respondents sued the appellant to recover a balance due on a promissory note for $4,571.65, and the appellants representing, under a change of name, The Ottawa & Gatineau Railway Co., and the Pontiac Pacific Railway Co., pleaded by way of compensation under the Code certain liquidated damages payable to them under a contract made 26th April, 1899, between the two said railway companies, now merged in and represented by the appellants, and the bridge company, respondents, for the building and erection of the superstructure of the Interprovincial Bridge between Ottawa and Hull, which was being constructed by the companies and parties the appellants now represent, and in which it was stipulated that:\nIn case the said superstructures should not. in all respects be completed on or before the first day of August, 1900, then the bridge company should pay to the parties of the second part (now represented by the appellant company) as liquidated and ascertained damages for such default and not as a penalty the sum of $50 for every subsequent day until the completion of the said bridge superstructure.\nThe railroad companies and persons now represented by the appellants, who had undertaken to erect the Interprovincial Bridge and had secured certain subsidies towards its construction from the Dominion and provincial governments, and from the Cities of Ottawa and Hull, not being considered financially strong, had secured the co-operation of a financial syndicate to assist them and contemporaneously with the execution of the contract for the construction by the bridge company of the superstructure, another contract was entered into between the same parties and the financial syndicate as a third party in which, after reciting the contract by the bridge company for the erection of the metal superstructure and the disposition of the different bonuses and subsidies granted and expected towards the construction of the bridge, the syndicate agreed with the bridge company to supply the railroad companies and persons with whom it had contracted, now represented by appellants, with all the necessary funds to enable them to carry out the construction of all those portions of the bridge and its approaches as had not been undertaken by the bridge company by their past recited agreement, so as to enable such companies and parties to carry out and complete the works in the third clause of the agreement within the respective times therein mentioned.\nThe railroad companies and persons represented by appellants thereupon in the said third clause agreed with the bridge company, respondents (inter alia), that:\nAll of the substructures and piers of the said bridge should be fully completed and ready for the building and placing by the bridge company of the metal superstructures thereon on or before the first day of September, 1899.\nThe learned trial judge found in accordance with the evidence that the defendants (appellants) did not complete the substructure till some months after the stipulated time, and that the delay in the completion by the bridge company of the superstructure contract was not caused by the delay of the defendants in constructing the substructure, but by the difficulty of the bridge company in obtaining structural steel. He further found that the work of the defendant in completing the approaches and in finishing the bridge ready for traffic was not delayed by the delay in the plaintiff's work, that, thus, the defendant suffered no damage by plaintiffs' delay, and that the conditions of the payment of the subsidies as to time were at the request of both parties, plaintiffs and respondents, extended for six months, so that no damage resulted from loss on that score.\nIn the result he held that as the several obligations of the parties for the construction of the substructure and the superstructure were dependent, the covenant on the part of the defendants for the construction of the substructure within the specified time limit was a condition precedent to their right to the liquidated damages provided for, and not having been complied with, the liquidated damages could not be recovered as such or be opposable in compensation against plaintiffs' claim on the note.\nHe further held that even if the penalty or liquidated damages were held to be recoverable in whole or in part the debt represented by them was not \"liquid\" either as to its existence or amount within the meaning of the Code. An appeal to the Court of King's Bench was dismissed on the latter ground. Mr. Justice Blanchet, however, while concurring in dismissing the appeal, did so on the ground that the parties by their conduct and actions in applying for extensions of time for the completion of their work to the governments and corporations paying the subsidies had thereby waived the agreement to pay stipulated damages for non-compliance with their contractual agreements as to time.\nI confess that I have had great doubts on the questions involved. After much consideration, however, I have reached the conclusion that the two clauses in the contract deeds providing, the one for the completion of the substructure, and the other of the superstructure, at specified times, were mutual and dependent one on the other, and that as the defendants failed to complete the substructures for some months after the period they had stipulated to do so, and there are, to say the least, grave doubts as to whether their default was not the occasion, at least in part, of plaintiffs' default in completing the superstructure, they lost the right to recover the liquidated damages stipulated for and were relegated to their ordinary right to recover just such damages as they could prove they sustained.\nThe construction of the substructure was, of course, a necessary condition precedent to the erection of the superstructure. Whether a contractual obligation had been specifically entered into by the appellants for the construction of such substructure or not it would necessarily have to be implied, and if by delay on the appellants' part in providing the substructure or the approaches the bridge company was prevented completing its superstructure contract within the stipulated time, the provision for stipulated damages could not be invoked and the appellant would be relegated to his ordinary proof of damages. Then, why was any stipulation required by the bridge company as to the completion of the substructure and approaches? Simply, as was so strongly argued by the respondents' counsel, because they desired to incorporate the element of time in the condition. The building of the substructure being a condition precedent the time within which it should be built was inserted and made part of that condition. If a condition precedent it must, of course, have been fully performed and satisfied in order to render the promise absolute, and it lies upon the promise to prove the performance or an excuse for non-performance. Heard v. Wadham([15]); Clack Y. Wood ([16]).\nThe dependence or independence of covenants is to be collected from the evident sense and meaning of the parties and, however transposed they may be in the deed, their procedure must depend upon the order of time in which the intent of the transaction requires their performance. Mansfield C.J. Kingston v. Preston, ([17]); Leake on Contracts (4 ed.) p. 456.\nOf course it makes no difference whether the parties have put their contract in one or more deeds. Their intent must be gathered from the entire contract, and if there are contemporaneous deeds on the same subject matter affecting the relative rights of the parties inter se, they must, of course, be read together. If the covenant by the appellants to build the substructure and approaches by a specified time was in the same deed as the covenant by the bridge company to finish the superstructure, the dependence of the one covenant upon the other might seem more marked. But the fact of the mutual covenants being in separate deeds cannot make any difference in their construction.\nThe law is stated very clearly with respect to the right to recover liquidated damages where impossibility of performance is caused by an act of a party to the contract in Leake on Contracts (4 ed.) p. 496, where all the cases are collected. The latest case appears to be that of Dodd v. Churton([18]). In that case the act of the promisee, which, it was held, discharged the promisee from his liability to pay liquidated damages at a stipulated rate for each week's delay, was the requiring of certain extra work to be done as it was stipulated in the contract he had a right to require. The additional works called for only involved two weeks' delay after the specified date. The actual delay was for twenty-five weeks longer, and for these twenty-five weeks the owner claimed from the contractor the stipulated and liquidated weekly damages. The Court of Appeal held, however, the contractor had been exonerated, and that if the clause relating to stipulated damages was intended to be applicable to a condition where extra work had been required to be done it must be explicitly made so applicable. All the authorities are reviewed in this case, and the application of the principle it lays down to the case before us is fatal to the right claimed by appellants.\nAs I understand that principle, it is that if the owner by the ordering of extra work or by the doing or omitting to do any act which he ought to have done or omitted has delayed the contractor in beginning the work or necessarily increased the time requisite for finishing the work he thereby disentitles himself to claim the penalties for non-completion provided for by the contract. It avails not for the promisee to say there were other reasons besides my default for your failure to fulfil your covenant, in fact the real cause of your failure lay with and in yourself, and my failure was not the reason of yours. Such reasoning would avail in any action in which the actual damages suffered were sought to be recovered, but not in an action to recover stipulated iquidated damages in the nature of a penalty. Where the promise broken is dependent on a promise of the promisee which in itself is a condition precedent of the fulfilment of the promise sought to be enforced, and such condition precedent is not performed, only the actual damages and not the stipulated can be recovered.\nIn this case I am not satisfied that the appellants' delay and default with regard to the substructure did not delay the respondent in completing the superstructure, nor am I satisfied that the conduct of the parties subsequently did not operate as a waiver. I therefore concur in the conclusion of the Chief Justice that the damages claimed cannot be opposed by way of compensation to plaintiffs' claim on the note.\nNESBITT J. (dissenting).\u2014The plaintiffs, the bridge company, sued upon a note made by the rail way company, and to this there is no defence other than the claim by the railway company that the bridge company were in default under a contract by which it agreed:\nAnd in case the said superstructures shall not in all respects be completed on or before the 1st day of August, 1900, then the bridge company shall pay to the parties of the second part as liquidated and ascertained damages for such default and not as a penalty the sum of $50 for every subsequent day until the completion of the said bridge superstructures covered by sub-clause a of clause 2 hereof. The first objection taken is a matter of procedure, viz.: that this defence is set up as a matter of compensation. Art. 1188 provides:\nCompensation takes place by the sole operation of the law between debts which are equally liquidated and demandable and have each for object a sum of money or a certain quantity of indeterminate things of the same kind and quantity.\nOn this point I do not desire to reiterate the reasons given by Mr. Justice Blanchet in the court below.\nThe next objection was that two other parties should be plaintiffs, and I again adopt the reasoning of Mr. Justice Blanchet upon this point without repeating his language.\nThe next objection is that by another contract the defendants were to provide the approaches, etc., eleven months before the date stipulated in the contract I have referred to when the penalties should begin to run.\nThe defendants answered this by alleging that the evidence clearly established that their default in no way had relation to the failure to complete the approaches, and that it is indisputable that such default to supply the superstructures arose from the plaintiffs' inability to obtain structural steel. The plaintiffs, I think, cannot rely upon this being a condition precedent, as I think it is proved the delay did not affect the plaintiffs' default, and the case seems to me to differ from such cases as Holme v. Guppy([19]) and Dodd v. Churton([20]). See the language in Wright v. Cabot([21]); Hudson on Building Contracts (2 ed.) p. 237; Russell v. Da Bandiera([22]:); also Dodd v. Chur-ion(2), at pp. 566 and 568, where Lord Esher M.E. and Chitty L.J. both indicate the condition must have effected the delay.\nThe plaintiffs further object that no damage is shewn and appeal to article 1066, C.C., which is as follows:\nThe creditor, without prejudice to his claim for damages, may require also that anything which has been done in breach of the obligation shall be undone, if the nature of the case will permit, and the court may order this to be effected by its officers, or authorize the injured party to do it, at the expense of the other.\nBut if the obligation has been performed in part, to the benefit of the creditors, and the time for its complete performance be not material, the stipulated sum may be reduced unless there be a special agreement to the contrary.\nThe defendants reply art. 1076, C.C., which is as follows:\nWhen it is stipulated that a certain sum shall be paid for damages for the inex\u00e9cution of an obligation, such sum and no other, either greater or less, is allowed to the creditor for such damages.\nI need only refer to the latest case upon the point, Clydebank Eng. & Shipbuilding Co. v. Don Jose Ramos Yzquierdo y Castaneda ([23]), to establish the proposition that this $50 a day is not a penalty. In this case the sum reserved was fixed by the parties to cover many elements of damage which might be suggested, such as payment of interest while the payment of subsidies was delayed; loss of the use of the bridge, etc., and, indeed, the railway companies gave notes during the process of manufacture which were deducted by, the bridge company from the subsidies assigned to it, and interest for the delay occasioned by the bridge company was deducted by the bridge company from the railway company.\nThe next objection, and the only one in which Mr. Justice Blanchet agreed with the plaintiffs was, that owing to the defendants having petitioned for an extension of the time within which the subsidies were payable there as an implied consent to waive the damage clause. I cannot agree in this view. The defendants were to be paid subsidies conditional upon completion within a time stated. The plaintiffs were under contract with the defendants to finish within that period, and under contract to pay a certain per diem sum for failure. The plaintiffs notified the defendants they could not finish within that period owing to their inability to get structural steel. The defendants were compelled by this default to apply for the extension of the time for payment of subsidies, and I fail to see how that affects the contract of the plaintiffs with them to complete. No other practical course was open to the defendants, and in the absence of an express agreement to waive their right against the plaintiffs under the contract I cannot see how they have lost them. I was inclined to think the doctrine referred to in Hughes v. Metropolitan Railway Co. ([24]) would assist the bridge company, and that it might say that, while no waiver at law existed in its favour, yet the defendants by applying for the extension had (unintentionally it may be) led it to suppose that the contract for time would not be insisted upon, and I would have been of the view that it was a good answer but for the fact that the bridge company asserted that the application for time would have no effect on its conduct, and it would finish so soon as it could. We cannot imply in a party's favour what he himself says is not the fact.\nIn my view the plaintiffs are liable to the defendants for the $50 per day for every day they were in default under the clause I have quoted, and the appeal should be allowed with costs in all courts.\nSince writing the above I have read the judgments of the Chief Justice and my brother Girouard, and although I would at once withdraw any view I might entertain on a question of procedure in Quebec, which was contrary to one expressed by them, I think that as all the fact were fully tried out, and it was not suggested any further evidence could be adduced on a trial in which the defendants claimed the sum stipulated for as a per diem allowance, the justice of the case demands this court should make any amendments necessary to dispose of the real question in issue. See Price v. Fraser([25]).\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondents sued appellants upon their promissory note and they set up a defence of compensation arising out of another transaction between the same parties.\nThe appellants are the successors of other companies whose rights, and the rights of one Beemer, are vested in them in respect of a covenant contained in a deed dated 26th April, 1899:\nThis covenant is as follows:\nAnd in case the said superstructures shall not in all respects be completed on or before the first day of August, A.D. 1900, then the bridge company shall pay to the parties of the second part as liquidated and ascertained damages for such default, and not as a penalty, the sum of fifty dollars for every subsequent day until the completion of the said bridge superstructure covered by sub-clause a of clause 2 hereof.\nThe work was not done within the specified time. The parties of the second part, referred to as such in the covenant, are those whose rights the appellants have acquired.\nIt has been contended that those liquidated damages are not claire et liquide such as can be set up by simple defence of compensation, and that any rights appellants may have to claim the same can only be asserted by means of a cross action or an independent action.\nI think, if simplicity of character in the claim and its susceptibility of easy proof are the tests to apply to find out whether it is within the meaning of article 1188 of the Civil Code, this stands that test very well.\nThat is certain which can be reduced to certainty.\nIt is admitted such a principle may in some cases be invoked to bring claims within the meaning of this article.\nIt is shewn here much evidence has been taken and how many questions the parties have tried to raise, and we are asked to consider the point in light thereof, and pressed that if we do we must conclude that the claim was not claire et liquide as the authors say it ought to be.\nI dissent from that. I think the claim must, as regards the length of the evidence and argument, be looked at by the results arrived at. If the evidence and other things, such as pleadings, contentions and arguments, have been unfounded they cannot be considered in deciding as to the point of simplicity or complication of the claim. Litigants can, if so disposed, always make the clearest and simplest look the very reverse.\nIt is quite clear that the respondents covenanted to pay so much per day after a certain date if their work was not then finished, and there has been no real contest as to the fact that the work was not finished then, or until a date at which that per diem allowance would exhaust all the appellants can claim in\" this action.\nThe respondent sets up also that the covenant in question was conditional upon the performance by the appellants of their covenant to have the substructure of the work in question done by a certain date.\nThese respective covenants of the parties are in separate deeds.\nI do not attach much importance to that. Even if they had formed a part of the same deed we must, in construing them, have asked, as we do now: Did the parties intend and express the intention that the one covenant should be 'dependent on the other?\nIf they intended so they have here clearly omitted to do so.\nIs there anything to be implied in the contract or both contracts read as a whole to supply this want of expression?\nI am unable to see how.\nThe covenant of the appellants with, and required by, respondents from appellants' assignors\nthat the substructures and piers of the said bridge shall be fully completed and ready for the building and placing by the bridge company of the metal superstructures thereon on or before the first day of September, 1899, etc.\nexists in a document that has relation to, and aimed entirely at, securing the fulfilment of the conditions upon which subsidies therein referred to were to be earned, and secured to the respondents as their source of payment or security for payment.\nIt could not be said to have relation to anything else save that all documents between the parties had reference to the common purpose of a bridge to be erected. It sometimes happens that parties engage in works of construction where one of them to permit of due expedition by the other of his work, must give assurance that a particular part of such work will be done and out of the way of the other by a given date, and in such cases we often find mutual covenants for liquidated damages or penalties.\nThe frame of the contract in such cases evidences the intention and, with or without the provisions for damages being mutual, there sometimes occur expressions of mutuality that enables the court to imply dependence of the one covenant in the performance of the other. The case of Dodd v. Churton([26]) illustrates, in a way, one form of the many such cases that can be found in the books, but this case in hand, so far as I can see, is not brought within any of them.\nI think the respondents had just that security that every contractor has, that the law implies that he for whom the work is being done shall not omit to do all that is needed in reason to be done to enable the work to proceed with due regard to the time specified for its completion.\nIf the owner fails to observe this implied obligation, and by reason thereof there has been delay, then the contractor is absolved from his covenant for performance or penalties or damages absolutely or partially as the terms of the contract may declare or imply.\nIf the north end pier had been shewn to be a necessity for the possible execution of the respondents-work at the other end of the bridge, or its absence a serious obstacle to the work, then they might have been absolved. Nothing of the kind is shewn. It is a daily occurrence that one class of work may be proceeding on one part of the structure whilst another may not yet be quite begun.\nHere there was nothing done or omitted to be done by the appellants that by reason thereof can fairly be said to have occasioned respondents' delay that is now in question.\nI include in that all that has been said or can be said to have arisen from the appellants joining in the application to the City of Ottawa for an extension of time.\nThere was nothing inconsistent in all that took place in that connection with the completion by the respondents of their work within the specified time or the continued existence of the obligation then resting upon them to have it so completed.\nHow or upon what principle of law, short of some inconsistency being created, between the sanction to be given by the City to the extension asked, and the continuance of the obligation or possibility of the due fulfilment thereof, such consent as appellants gave could release the obligation, I am quite unable to comprehend.\nHad there been created such a conflict by the acts to which appellants' assignors were parties, then there must of necessity have been implied a rescission or modification of the original contract.\nThat not being the case I think the appeal must be allowed with costs and the action be dismissed with costs, save such costs as the plaintiffs therein may be entitled to up to the time of the communication of Beemer's want of interest in the claim.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants : Campbell, Meredith, Macpherson & Hague.\nSolicitor for the respondents : A.

Avenue in the Town of Maisonneuve, and restore the roadway as nearly as possible to its original condition, and that the costs of the application should be paid by the appellants to the respondents.\nThe circumstances under which the dispute arose are as follows:\nThe Montreal Terminal Railway was declared to be for the general advantage of Canada by the Act 57 & 58 Vict. ch. 83. It passed through the Town of Maisonneuve and, in virtue of its charter and an agreement with the town, the respondents obtained an order under sec. 175 of the \"Railway Act, 1903,\" from the Board of Commissioners for Canada dated 8th June, 1904, approving of proposed branch lines upon Ernest Street among others. On 30th September, 1904, a further order was made by the Board under sec. 184 of the Railway Act, granting leave to carry and operate the said branch line along and upon said street upon obtaining the consent of the Town of Maisonneuve. The respondents proceeded with the construction of said branch line across the intersection of Ernest Street and a projected street, named Pius IX. Avenue, when the appellants, who operate a tramway which extends into the Town of Maisonneuve, on the 15th of October, 1904, laid a double set of tracks, sixty feet in length, across Ernest Street at said intersection, thus obstructing the work of the respondents, crossing their proposed line and preventing them from laying their rails. No other rails were laid on either side of the rails forming the obstruction to connect them with the appellants' tramway.\nUpon application by the respondents the Board of Railway Commissioners, under sees. 23 and 44 of the Railway Act, by the order appealed from ordered the appellants to remove the obstructing rails.\nThe appeal is taken under the first part of paragraph 3 of sec. 44 of the Railway Act, and involves the question merely of the jurisdiction of the Board to make the order complained of.\nCampbell K.C. for the appellants. The order appealed from is beyond the jurisdiction or authority of the Board of Railway Commissioners, because the respondents had no power to enter into a contract with the town for the construction or operation of an electric street railway; they had no charter power to construct or operate any such railway. The appellants had power to construct the track on Pius IX. Avenue both from the Legislature of Quebec and the Town of Maisonneuve, and the line so constructed was its property. The order in question could not be carried out without the destruction of the appellants' property and interference with its civil rights, matters wholly under the jurisdiction of the Legislature of Quebec and the courts having civil jurisdiction in that province.\nThe Railway Act does not confer upon the Board of Railway Commissioners any authority to authorize the use by federal corporations of the streets of municipalities unless the company should first obtain the consent by by-law of the municipality validly passed, approved and sanctioned under the provisions of the existing municipal laws, in the present case, arts. 481 and 484 of the Quebec Municipal Code. It does not confer, and could not confer, any authority to order the destruction of property or to affect civil rights except in so far as sec. 101 of the British North America Act, 1867, permits. Section 7 of the \"Railway Act, 1903,\" does not bring a provincial electric railway within the purview of the Act, so far as the removal or destruction of the railway of the provincial company is concerned, but only as to \"connection\" or \"crossing,\" both of which words imply the continued existence of the provincial work.\nIf any provisions of the \"Railway Act, 1903,\" can be construed so as to empower the Board to order the demolition of the works of a provincial company, it is ultra vires to that extent.\nDandurand K.C. and Belcourt K.C. for the respondents. It is too late now for the appellants to question the jurisdiction of the Board; besides this we contend that the Board had full jurisdiction to make the order.\nThe appellants were represented before the Board at the hearing and answered the application by counsel; they joined issue on the merits and accepted the jurisdiction and they are now estopped from questioning the jurisdiction of the Board. They accepted the tribunal, and there is nothing, in law, to prevent the Board from adjudicating in the matter. The question of jurisdiction, if any there was, could only arise on account of the personality of the appellants, i.e., the fact of their incorporation by the provincial legislature. The jurisdiction ratione person\u0153 is not a question of public order and a tribunal which on that ground would not have jurisdiction of right can validly adjudicate with the consent, even tacit, of the parties. Pothier, Trait\u00e9 de Proc\u00e9dure, ch. 2, sec. 4, sub-secs. 2 et 3; L'Union St. Joseph de Montr\u00e9al v. Lapierre[2]; Oakes v. City of Halifax[3]; Beauchamp, Jurisprudence of the Privy Council, p. 611, No. 62; p. 624, Nos. 101, 104, 105, 108, 109, 111. Under any circumstances the Board had full jurisdiction in the matter under sec. 23 of the Railway Act, and the appellants had violated the orders, previously made by the Board in June and September, by laying tracks across the respondents' line without the previous authorization of the Board as required by sec. 177. They acted contrary to orders based on sees. 175 and 184 of the Railway Act by obstructing the construction and operation of the branch line authorized and sanctioned by said two orders. The Board, therefore, had complete jurisdiction in the matter, and appellants cannot as a provincial railway claim exemption from the operation of the \"Railway Act, 1903.\" The words of sec. 23 are conclusive; every violation of the Act brings the offender under the jurisdiction of the Board. Section 7 of the \"Railway Act, 1903,\" enacts that every steam or electric street railway or tramway authorized by special Act of the legislature of any province crossing the line of a railway subject to the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada comes under the Act as regards such a crossing. Even supposing the terms of the Act did not make it specially applicable in the premises, under the rules governing the interpretation of statutes the Board would still have jurisdiction because the Act was passed with a certain object and a tribunal constituted to carry out that object; consequently, that tribunal is vested with all the powers necessary to that end, even though such powers are not specially mentioned. Beauchamp, Jurisprudence of the Privy Council, p. 765, No. 127. If the appellants can defy the Board the power given respondents, under authority delegated by Parliament, would be set at naught and the orders of the Board would be utterly valueless. Under see. 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, railways declared to be for the general advantage of Canada are excluded from the classes of subjects in relation to which the legislatures may exclusively legislate and, by sec 91, the Parliament of Canada may legislate upon any matter not exclusively assigned to the provinces. This has been done by special Acts concerning the company and by the Railway Act. It is true this legislation in its operation affects a purely local company, but it does so only incidentally and without taking the right of crossing under certain conditions from the appellants. In many instances Dominion legislation incidentally affects provincial subjects, but the principle now well determined by jurisprudence is that the incidental effects of a federal law over provincial matters does not affect its validity. See Lefroy, Legislative Power in Canada, prop. 36, p. 416, prop. 37, p. 425 (f). Under such circumstances the balance of power being with the federal authority (secs. 91 and 92 B. N. A. Act) and local interests being subservient to general interests, the federal law must govern. Lefroy, prop. 46, p. 52 (f). Railways are the arteries of trade and commerce and the principal factors therein and conflicts between railways of the character in question in this case are of a nature to interfere with trade and commerce. It is therefore natural that the law to govern in such a case should be the federal law, the regulation of trade and commerce being assigned exclusively to the federal authority.\nAs to civil rights, all the appellants can claim is the right of constructing lines and branch lines in localities determined by its charter for the purpose of carrying passengers, and, incidentally, laying tracks for the purpose of establishing said lines. They cannot, however, shew any law or statute authorizing them to obstruct any other railway, and yet that is what they have done wilfully and maliciously. Their object was not the construction of a line to carry passengers, but merely a wilful obstruction. How, then, has the Railway Act or the Board interfered with its civil rights? See Masten, Company Law, p. 90, No. 11.\nThe orders of the Board in June and September, 1904, have not been attacked, they are still in full force and effect and manifestly within the powers of the Board. This court ought not to interfere with the order of the 27th December, 1904, as it is merely a consequence of the previous orders and for the purpose of enforcing them.\nA. G. Blair for the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada. The order appealed from was necessary to enforce the former orders. The jurisdiction of the Board to make the orders made in June and September is not and cannot be questioned. The Board, consequently, was vested with all the necessary authority for the enforcement of the former orders, validily made in June and September, when they judged it proper to do so in deciding upon the respective rights of the applicant company and the contestants. Both parties appeared before the Board, submitted to their jurisdiction as a special tribunal, presented their respective contentions, and the decision they arrived at ought to be binding upon both of them.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014This case comes up under sec. 44, sub-sec. 3, of the \"Railway Act, 1903,\" by special leave, on an appeal upon a question of jurisdiction from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners. The order appealed from, dated the 27th day of December, 1904, reads substantially as follows:\nIN THE MATTER OF\nThe application of the Montreal Terminal Railway, hereinafter called \"The Applicant Company\" under sec. 23 of the \"Railway Act, 1903,\" to the Board for an order directing the Montreal Street Railway Company to remove the two sets of rails which the said company has placed across the line of the applicant company in course of construction, and across the width of Ernest Street in line with the projected street known under the name of Pius IX. in the town of Maisonneuve.\nWHEREAS by an order of the Board, dated the 8th day of June, 1904, the plans, profiles and books of reference of proposed branch lines of the applicant company along and upon Adams Street, Ernest Street, Sherbrooke Street, Orleans Street, LaSalle Street, and Second Avenue, in the Town of Maisonneuve, were approved and sanctioned subject to the terms and conditions of an agreement bearing date the 30th day of April, A.D. 1904, made between the Corporation of the Town of Maisonneuve and the Montreal Terminal Railway Co., the applicant company being also authorized to construct, maintain and operate the said branch lines;\nWHEREAS by a further order of the Board, dated the 30th day of September, A.D. 1904, leave was granted under sec. 184 of the \"Railway Act, 1903,\" to the applicant company to establish and operate its line of railway on Ernest Street, Orleans Street, Sherbrooke Street, LaSalle Streat, Adams Street, and Second Avenue, in the Town of Maisonneuve, in accordance with the terms of the said agreement of the 30th of April, 1904;\nWHEREAS this application was heard in the presence of counsel for the applicant company and for the Montreal Street Railway Company; and it appearing from the evidence adduced for the applicant company, under and by virtue of the above recited orders of the 8th of June and the 30th of September, 1904, had proceeded to establish and operate its line of railway along said Ernest Street, in the Town of Maisonneuve; and\nWHEREAS during the night of the 15th of October, 1904, the Montreal Street Railway Company did lay double rails across the line of the railway of the applicant company, at the intersection of said Ernest Street with Pius IX. Avenue, thereby obstructing and impeding the establishment of the applicant company's line of railway as authorized by the said orders of the Board of the 8th of June and the 30th of September, 1904, said obstruction being in violation of the said orders\u2014therefore\nIT IS ORDERED\nThat the Montreal Street Railway Company do, at its own cost and expense, remove, within forty-eight hours after the service upon it of this order, the rails and other obstructions so laid down by the said Montreal Street Railway Company at the intersection of Ernest Street and Pius IX. Avenue, in the Town of Maisonneuve, and restore the roadway as nearly as possible to its original condition.\nIn answer to the respondents' application to the Board for that order, the appellant company had pleaded as one of the grounds for their opposition to the respondent's application that:\nThe Town of Maisonneuve had no power to grant to the Montreal Terminal Railway Company and the Montreal Terminal Railway Company had no power to acquire from the Town of Maisonneuve the right to construct or operate branch or circuit lines by electricity in the town and the contract referred to as passed before Ecrement, Notary, on the 30th day of April, 1904, was ultra vires of the town and, moreover, could not under the statutes of the Province of Quebec, bind the said town, except with the approval and sanction of the municipal electors of the said town and the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, neither of which approvals had been obtained.\nThe appellants, by that plea, based their opposition to the order of the 27th December, 1904, which they now appeal from on the ground of the illegality of the two previous orders of the Board, one of June, 1904, and the other of September, 1904, which are the foundation, in express terms, of the last order, of 27th December last, now appealed from.\nBy the said order of June, the Board had decreed:\nThat the branch lines of the applicant company (the present respondent) as shewn on and by the plans, profiles and books of reference on file with the Board under No. 12957, file No. 643, be and the same are hereby approved and sanctioned, subject to the terms and conditions of agreement bearing date the 30th day of April, 1904, and made between the Corporation of the Town of Maisonneuve and the Montreal Terminal Railway Company;\nThat the applicant company be and they are hereby authorized to construct, maintain and operate the said branch lines.\nAnd by the order of September, the respondent company were granted leave to establish and operate their line of railway on Ernest, Orleans, Sherbrooke, LaSalle and Adam Streets and Second Avenue, in the Town of Maisonneuve, Province of Quebec, in accordance with the terms of agreement entered into between the said applicant company and the Corporation of the Town of Maisonneuve, under the date of 30th April, 1904.\nI understand that the majority of the court are of opinion that this appeal from the order of December should be allowed upon the ground taken as above by the appellants in their plea that the two previous orders referred to are illegal because they are based, as appears on their face, upon the contract with the Town of Maisonneuve of the 30th of April, 1904, which, as pleaded by the appellants, was ultra vires of the said town.\nI have to dissent from that conclusion upon the simple ground that the said contract cannot be impugned by the appellant company in such a collateral proceeding as this one is, especially in the absence of one of the parties to that contract, the Town of Maisonneuve.\nThe Board of Railway Commissioners had not the power to set it aside. They had to treat it as in full force and effect. They might have suspended their proceedings, had the appellants applied for it, so as to allow them to regularly impeach the said contract and the by-law which authorized it before the provincial tribunals having jurisdiction in the matter. But in the absence of any application to that effect they had to treat it as legal and valid and give effect, as they have done, to their two first orders.\nThe appellants would have this court substitute itself, as a court of first instance, for the provincial tribunals of original jurisdiction in the matter. This in my opinion, we should refuse to do.\nThough unnecessary for the determination of this appeal, in the view taken by the majority of the court, I feel in duty bound to say that there is, in my opinion, no foundation whatever for the appellants' contention that the \"Railway Act, 1903,\" in any of the sections in question in this case or referred to by the parties, is ultra vires and unconstitutional.\nThe Railway Board's action would be paralyzed in its most important functions were their powers curtailed as the appellants contend they should be.\nIts powers are extensive no doubt, but they necessarily had to be, in the public interest, for the efficient control and administration of the railway system of the country.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting), concurred with the Chief Justice.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This is an appeal granted by leave of a judge of this court under sec. 44 of the \"Railway Act, 1903,\" from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners made on the 27th December, 1904, ordering the immediate demolition and removal of an obstruction laid down by the Montreal Street Railway Company upon the road-bed for a railway built by the Terminal Railway Co. (respondents) at the intersection of Ernest Street and Pius IX. Avenue in the Town of Maisonneuve, and to restore the road-bed as nearly as possible to its original condition.\nThe only question for us to determine is whether the Board of Railway Commissioners had jurisdiction to make the order appealed from.\nThe road-bed of the respondents at the intersection of the two streets in the Town of Maisonneuve had been made after the company had entered into a contract with the town for the construction of an electric road, of which the road-bed in question formed a part, through the limits and along and across certain streets of the town.\nA by-law, or resolution on which to base one, had been introduced into the town council and passed by it, authorizing a contract to be entered into with the respondents for the construction of this road, but it was admitted that such by-law had never as a fact been submitted to the ratepayers or to the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council for approval as prescribed by sec. 481 of the Municipal Code of Quebec.\nThe 23rd section of the \"Railway Act, 1903,\" confers upon the Board of Commissioners full jurisdiction to inquire into, hear and determine any application by or on behalf of any party interested and (inter alia) sub-sec. (6).\nrequesting the Board to make any order or give any direction, sanction or approval which by law it is authorized to make or give.\nI cannot have any doubt that in making any order within its jurisdiction the Board has full and complete power to make it effective, and that, if in the case before us the Board was invested with power to make an order on the subject of this obstruction, the form it adopted would not be open to the objections taken to it as infringing upon the powers and charter rights of a provincial railway or to property and civil rights within the province. I have had occasion so very lately to discuss the plenary powers which Parliament possesses to legislate under the enumerated sub-sections of sec. 91 of the B. N. A. Act, 1867, that I need not repeat my arguments here[4]. Then, as to the authority of the Board in this ease we are referred to the 184th section of the Railway Act. It reads:\nThe railway may be carried upon, along or across an existing highway upon leave therefor having been first obtained from the Board as hereinafter provided, but the Board shall not grant leave to any company to carry any street railway or tramway, or any railway operated or to be operated as a street railway or tramway, along any highway which is within the limits of any city or incorporated town, until the company has first obtained consent therefor by a by-law of the municipal authority of such city or incorporated town.\nSub-section 3 of the above section reads:\nNothing in this section shall deprive any such company of rights conferred upon it by any special Act of the Parliament of Canada, or amendment thereof, passed prior to the present session of Parliament.\nSeveral questions were discussed at the bar arising out of this section.\nMr. Belcourt contended strongly that the section did not apply at all because the provincial charter gave the company power to build it with the consent of the municipality, and that the charter granted by the Dominion Parliament subsequently (57 & 58 Vict. ch. 83) in its second section preserved this right to it. A careful comparison of the two charters convinces me that this contention cannot be sustained.\nThe Dominion charter prescribing exactly through what municipalities the roads the company (thereby made a Dominion corporation) were authorized to build should run, applying to the company and its undertaking the Dominion Railway Act, and making complete provision for the construction and operation of the undertaking it authorized, necessarily repealed the general powers of the provincial charter, giving general powers to build anywhere in the Island of Montreal. The powers conferred by the two charters were inconsistent, and the later Dominion legislation having been applied for by the company itself repeals the provincial legislation with which it is inconsistent, excepting in so far as any of the latter powers are specifically retained,\nMr. Belcourt argued that the power to build was retained by the 2nd section of the Dominion charter as being a \"right or privilege acquired,\" but I think Mr. Campbell's answer was irresistible that the true meaning of the words of that section is that they apply only to assets and liabilities of the company, and not to its charter powers.\nEven if that was not so, and if the company retained, after obtaining its Dominion powers, the full powers originally granted by the local legislature, I would have no hesitation in holding that the consent of the municipality which by the local charter was made a condition precedent of the right to build, meant a legal consent, a consent in the way and manner prescribed by the Municipal Act, a consent by bylaw approved of by the ratepayers and Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council.\nThen sec. 184 of the Railway Act applying what does it mean? It says:\nThe railway (which by the interpretation clause in this case means the railway authorized by the Dominion charter) may be carried upon, along or across an existing highway upon leave therefor having been first obtained from the Board as hereinafter provided.\nAnd then it goes on to provide that the Board shall not grant the leave until the company has first obtained the consent of the municipality, city or town, as the case may be. This consent of the municipality, to be evidenced by a by-law, is made a condition precedent to the exercise by the Board of its powers. The method of evidencing that consent is by bylaw, and this must, of course, comply with the requirements of the provincial law in that regard, defining what is necessary to constitute a valid by-law. In Quebec such a by-law must be approved of by the majority in number and value of the electors, proprietors of taxable real estate, as well as by the Lieutenant Governor in Council.\nTwo ex parte applications were made to the Board of Railway Commissioners by the respondent company, one in June, 1904, under the 175th section of the Railway Act, authorizing the construction of branch lines of not more than six miles in length, asking for the approval of plans of the company shewing the proposed lines of which this line in question is one, and the other on the 30th September, 1904, under the 184th section of the Act for leave to carry and operate its line along certain streets of Maisonneuve the line in question being one. Both applications were granted.\nAs to the former it is perhaps not necessary for me to express an opinion whether the clauses authorizing six mile branches apply to such an undertaking as that authorized by the respondent company's charter. Reading that charter carefully, as comprised in the two statutes, 57 & 58 Vict. ch. 83, and 62 & 63 Vict. ch. 76, I have no personal doubt that they do not, because it is evident that Parliament defined with great care the places through which and the extent to which the company might build, and the extension of the branch line sections into the charter would be quite inconsistent with its specific and definite provisions, and, in fact, be quite incongruous.\nWith respect to the latter order of the 30th September authorizing the running of the railway on the streets of Maisonneuve, it was an ex parte order made on the application of the Montreal Terminal Railway Co., and expresses upon its face to have been made upon the consent of the Corporation of the Town of Maisonneuve filed with the Board.\nThe Board knowing well that it could only make its order conditionally on the existence of a consent of the municipality evidenced by a by-law assumed the existence of such by-law and gave the order.\nThe railway company which made the application took the order at its peril. The consent referred to in the order does not profess in any way to say that the by-law had been approved as required by law, nor is there anything in the record from which such approval could be inferred.\nSuch approval was, in my opinion, necessary to the validity of the by-law and to enable the Board to make the order it did.\nWe are asked to presume that the by-law was submitted to the ratepayers and approved, but I think we cannot do that in the face of a by-law which professed to dispense with such an essential. Everything necessary to give validity to the proceedings of the Board in a case in which it has jurisdiction may well be presumed, but not the existence of facts on which the jurisdiction itself depends. And more especially not the existence of two essential facts necessary to the validity of a third fact, the by-law, where the third fact, the by-law, is proved, but the two others antecedent and indispensable facts are absolutely without mention, and nothing is said from which their existence could be inferred.\nWhen the application was made for the order to remove the obstruction now in immediate question, the appellant company pleaded in answer not only the absence of any proof of the facts, but also their nonexistence. The Board, therefore, made the order now before us in this appeal with full knowledge that certain facts necessary to give them jurisdiction were non-existent and not proved or without appreciating the importance of the objection. In my opinion it is fatal to the validity of the order impeached which, therefore, must be set aside.\nI have purposely refrained from entering into any discussion of the supposed rights of the appellants as it did not appear to be necessary for a decision of the only point here involved, viz.: the jurisdiction of the Railway Board to make the order.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs against the respondents in this court and before the Railway Board.\nNESBITT J.\u2014I have had the opportunity of reading the judgment of my brother Davies, and while agreeing in the result, desire to add a few words as to my reasons for so concurring.\nI think the Board of Railway Commissioners have full power to enforce any order which they may make in any case where they have jurisdiction; and that the fullest possible effect should be given to the language contained in the latter part of sec 23 of the \"Railway Act, 1903.\" The very object of the Act would be otherwise defeated if it was necessary to apply to the courts of the various provinces to enforce orders made by the Board.\nThe order, however, made in this case must be justified under secs. 177 and 184 of the Act, and, in order to bring itself under the latter, I think the applicant company must shew it has obtained an effective bylaw of the municipality according to the provincial law governing the making of such by-laws by municipalities; at least in the absence of express federal legislation empowering the building of the railway without such formalities being complied with. In this case Parliament merely authorizes the building of the railway upon obtaining the consent of the municipality, which must be interpreted to mean consent in legal form, and in this case consent as defined by sec. 481 of the Municipal Code. This authority was expressly denied, and the only evidence before us shews a lack of such authority, and sitting as we do in appeal we have a right to examine the evidence essential to jurisdiction required by the 184th section of the Railway Act.\nI express no opinion as to the application of the 175th section of the Act to electric tramways chartered to run between certain defined termini. The section was originally applicable to steam railways, which required short branches for the development of traffic arising from industrial or mining enterprises coming into existence near the main line, but by sec. 118 it may be very plausibly argued that Parliament has enabled any tramway chartered by it and declared to be for the general advantage of Canada to take advantage of the very extensive powers originally intended to serve public needs in the case of trunk lines.\nI agree with my brother Davies as to the meaning to be attached to the words \"right or privilege acquired\" used in the second section of the Dominion Act referred to.\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Board of the Railway Commissioners for Canada under sec. 44, sub-sec. 3, of the Railway Act, which provides that:\nAn appeal shall lie from the Board to the Supreme Court of Canada upon a question of jurisdiction.\nSection 23 of the said Act gives jurisdiction to the Board to inquire into, hear and determine any application by or on behalf of any party interested within sub-sections (a) and (b) of the said section. The latter sub-section provides as follows:\nAnd the Board may order and require any company or person to do forthwith or within or at any specified time and in any manner prescribed by the Board so far as is not inconsistent with this Act, any act, matter or thing which such company or person is or may be required to do under this Act or the special Act, and may forbid the doing or continuing of any act, matter or thing which is contrary to this Act or the special Act, and shall have full jurisdiction to hear and determine, etc., etc.\nThe question raised here is whether or not what was complained of before the Board comes within the part of the section I have quoted.\nIt seems that the appellants and respondents are rival companies, which I will assume for the present (but I am not expressing or to be held as here expressing any opinion upon the point), had each the power to build railways in the Town of Maisonneuve upon fulfilling the conditions of law enabling them to operate within the said town.\nThe appellants anticipating their future operations, in the way of construction within the said town, whilst the respondent company were building the road along Ernest Street, laid down at the intersection of that street with Pius IX. Avenue, transversely across Ernest Street, three lengths of rails, forming a double track, as if to become part of the railway when built along Pius IX. Avenue. The appellants had not at the time in question built any part of their road upon Pius IX. Avenue, but, avowedly, were laying down this small portion of track in the hope of getting some advantage as the senior road, when the questions would come to be determined of the two roads crossing each other at this junction, the mode of affecting the crossing, and the burthen to be borne by the respective companies in relation to the establishment and continuation of said crossing.\nI look upon that proceeding as highly irregular and that in doing it the appellant company stand in the same light as any one else, other than the railway company, in placing such an obstruction on the public highway would be in. Those doing any such act might be proceeded against, by the municipal authorities or ratepayers specially interested, or by the respondent company if they had acquired the right to lay a track upon Ernest Street and were obstructed thereby, in the ordinary courts of justice having jurisdiction in that behalf, to have such obstruction removed, and the parties putting it there restrained from a continuation of such obstruction, or laying down or erecting any such at any other place on the street over which the respondent company had a right to lay their track.\nI cannot understand, on the facts, that what was complained of was anything more than any other obstruction that evil disposed persons might be guilty of placing upon the street for the purpose of obstructing the respondent company or any other purpose.\nTo make this clear let us turn to the paragraph of sec. 23 that I have quoted and analyze it. It enables as follows: The Board to\n(1). Order and require any company or person to do * * * any act, matter or thing which such company or person is or may be required to do under this Act or the special Act. (2) Forbid the doing or continuing of any act, matter or thing which is contrary to this Act or the special Act.\nHow can the specific act complained of here be said to have been forbidden? Under what section of the Railway Act or any special Act were the appellants forbidden to do such an act as is complained of here?\nSuch an act, wholly irregular, never was contemplated as having been likely to occur and come within this Act, or the powers given the Board by this Act; or when done by anybody as requiring a new remedy to be applied by this legislation.\nThe only section upon which reliance has been placed in argument here, to shew that what has been done had been forbidden by the Act, is sec. 177. That section forbids one railway company to cross or join the lines or tracks of another railway company without the leave of the Board.\nThere were no lines or tracks in existence here. It is clearly a misapprehension to apply this section to projected lines that may never be built.\nWhat the section forbids is plainly, any company presuming to take to itself the right, for purposes of making a crossing, to meddle with the railway lines or tracks of any other company without permission. Thus far the public safety required some properly constituted authority to have the power of control. It is the public and the public interests alone that are to be looked to in every question coming up for interpretation under this legislation. The Board has been specially constituted for that protecting purpose. The conflicting powers that may exist only in theory and are not brought into operation as between two companies are something with which the Board has nothing to do.\nIt can still less be said that the removal that has been ordered of this obstruction was something contemplated by the Act. It seems to me that the plain ordinary meaning of either set of words I am referring to does not convey such a meaning as to clothe the Board of Railway Commissioners with power to enforce the civil rights of any company as against those who may have trespassed upon their property or, in any of the numerous ways one can conceive of, invaded their civil rights.\nThe whole scope and purpose of the legislation constituting the Board and assigning it certain powers is that the acts of the railway companies, as such, and the railway companies in their relation to each other, as such, shall be governed and controlled by the Board.\nI am not desirous of laying down here any rule (as to what is the power of government or control incidental to the main purpose of this legislation, and incidental to the jurisdiction thus defined) that will apply to all cases.\nI am clear, however, that the exercise of such powers as have been conferred upon the Board must be restricted within the literal meaning of the words I have quoted and what is necessarily implied or to be implied incidentally to giving that literal meaning full force and effect.\nTo permit of a wrong, such as I take it the appellant company were guilty of here, to be remedied by the action of the court of the Board of Railway Commissioners, would be but to open the door to the exercise of a wide jurisdiction over the railway companies, or any of them, in their relations to any or all of His Majesty's subjects in their dealings with or in opposition to a railway company and be beyond the scope of the \"Railway Act.\"\nI would suggest that when any question arises out of any such relationship, whether of a contractual character or in the nature of a trespass or other wrong, which is brought before the Board, they should be careful to ask whether what has been complained of has been forbidden specifically by the \"Railway Act\" or a special Act or regulations duly made by the Board as such, or a something that has been required by the \"Railway Act\" or special Act or such regulations to be done by a railway company. And if not, then the parties should be remitted to the ordinary tribunals.\nIn speaking of regulations I mean general regulations not specific orders. As to such orders though the Act seems to give them binding authority till appealed from or rescinded, that is not to be stretched too far. Prima facie they are valid and are declared by the Act to be valid.\nBut if they directed one railway company to amalgamate with another and be constituted one, or assigned the Parliament buildings to a railway company, I need not say such an order would be void. What may be intended by declaring such orders valid is to protect those who act under them, even if the orders turn out ultra vires.\nThe remarks of some members of the Board seem to indicate a different view taken in this case, and that may have lead to what I think is error in this order.\nThere is, however, another ground that I think is well taken if we are to assume that the evidence upon which it rests and the legal presumption arising from such evidence as is before us will permit us to say that the point is well taken. The point I refer to is this: The respondent company claimed to have entered into an agreement with the Corporation of the Town of Maisonneuve, giving the respondent the right to use the streets of the said town for the purpose of running their cars over them.\nThis agreement rests upon nothing but a resolution of the council of the town. It is said that there is no evidence of the absence of a by-law. The agreement upon its face purports only to be, pursuant to a resolution of the council, and the contention was set up before the Board that there was no by-law sanctioned by the people (and it was not denied), and therefore I think the presumption relied on cannot apply. No by-law was ever passed giving the consent which the agreement shews. The Railway Act, sec. 184, provides as follows:\nThe railway may be carried upon, along or across an existing highway upon leave therefor having been first obtained from the Board as hereinafter provided, but the Board shall not grant leave to any company to carry any street railway or tramway or any railway operated or to be operated as a street railway or tramway along any highway which is within the limits of any city or incorporated town until the company has first obtained consent therefor for a bylaw of the municipal authority of such city or incorporated town.\nThe Board in this case upon an ex parte motion, in June last, made an order approving and sanctioning branch lines of the applicant company\nsubject to the terms and conditions of agreement bearing date the 30th day of April, A.D. 1894, and made between the corporation of the Town of Maisonneuve and the Montreal Terminal Railway Company.\nand authorized the applicants to construct, maintain and operate the said branch lines.\nOn the 30th of September last, another ex parte order was made granting leave to the respondent to establish and operate its lines of railway on Ernest and other streets in Maisonneuve in accordance with the terms of the agreement already referred to.\nIt was urged before us that it must be presumed from these orders that the Board acted regularly, and that it follows therefrom, as a presumption, that the necessary by-law of the municipal authority required by sec. 184 already referred to had existence, and that such may not only be presumed, but must be presumed until this order has been set aside.\nI am unable to take that view. I think when the Board of Railway Commissioners had before them the facts stated on the application now in question and not controverted, that they should have observed that they had been led into error by the applicants as to these orders of June and September.\nMoreover, I think it may well be said that when the Board made such orders the presumption was that they did not intend them to operate until consent had been got in the proper manner from the proper municipal authority.\nI do not think there can be any question as to the intention of the legislature in enacting, as it has, in the Municipal Code. It is elementary law that every municipal corporation has only such powers as the legislature chooses to grant it. And the legislature, by art. 464 and art. 479, sub-secs. 4, 5, 6, of the Municipal Code, enacts as to the passing of by-laws as follows:\nArt. 464:\u2014Every municipal council has a right to make, amend or repeal by-laws, which refer to itself, its officers, or the municipality, upon any of the subjects mentioned in this chapter.\nArt. 479:\u2014Sub-sec. (4)\u2014By acquiring the right of way in the municipality for any railway company, either by mutual agreement, or by paying the price of the lands necessary for that purpose, as established by an expropriation made for that purpose under the provision of the Railway Act. (5) To provide for the establishment, construction or running, within the municipality, of lines of omnibuses, stages or tramways driven by steam or electricity, undertaken and built by incorporated companies or by any person or firm.\n(6)\u2014To grant to any company, person, or firm of persons who undertakes or has already undertaken to establish, construct or run such lines of omnibuses, stages or tramways driven by steam or electricity, a privilege for laying rails and running omnibuses, stages or electric or steam cars over its roads and streets, or within the limits of the said municipality, and to grant such persons an exclusive privilege for ten years.\nWe have not been referred to any other power than is thus conferred.\nArticle 481 provides that:\nEvery by-law passed in virtue of the two preceding articles shall before coming into force and effect, be approved by the majority in number and in value of the electors being proprietors of taxable real estate who have voted in the municipality, and by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council.\nNo other power has been given the municipal authorities to speak on. this subject. It is idle, in face of this, to argue that because a statute such as the special Act relied upon in this case has used the word \"consent\" without adding in what way to consent we are to infer some other power rather than that the law has expressly given.\nThere is only one lawful way in which the municipal authorities can exercise such high authority in the Province of Quebec. Elsewhere the need of such a restriction upon municipal councils has been much felt.\nIt would be rather shocking to find and tell the people of Quebec province, who are thus far in advance of others, that such proper legislation was of no avail to protect the ratepayers' municipality in the way it was intended they should be protected by restricting the authority of the council in such cases until the people had expressed their will in the usual way.\nI am satisfied also that sec. 184 I have quoted is not any authority for the Board of Railway Commissioners to act in any other case than where the consent of the municipal authority has been given by bylaw.\nThe saving clause, sub-sec. 3 of that section, which the respondent's counsel relied upon, does no more than preserve the rights conferred by any special Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nIf any such company should have, independently of the Board of Railway Commissioners, authority to run over the streets of any city or town that must stand. It is not affected by the will of the Commissioners or the authority given to the Commissioners.\nTo give effect to the presumptions alleged to exist in this case would be to permit the respondents to take advantage of their own wrong.\nI think it may well be laid down as a principle of action for all who apply to the Board of Railway Commissioners in cases such as we have before us that the utmost good faith should be observed.\nI do not wish it to be inferred that I think that in this case there was any intentional bad faith. I rather infer that it was a mistaken view of the law that led to the present position of matters.\nI think the appeal should be allowed. I do not think there should be any costs to either party. Though the appellants have succeeded on the law their conduct was such as should not be encouraged in any way. They are entirely to blame, in attempting to do what they did, for all the expense and trouble that has ensued including this application.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Campbell, Meredith, Macpherson & Hague.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Dandurand, Brodeur & Boyer.\n[1] 35 Can.

[1897] ch. 148, sec. 41.\nK., a manufacturing furrier, by agreement with a retail trading company, placed a quantity of his goods with the latter which could sell them as they pleased, paying on each sale, within 24 hours thereafter, the price mentioned in a list supplied by K.K. had the right to withdraw from the company any or all such goods at any time and all remaining unsold at the end of the season were to be returned. While still in possession of a quantity of K.\u2019s goods the company made an assignment for benefit of creditors and they were claimed by the assignee.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (9 Ont. L.R. 164), which maintained the verdict for defendant at the trial (7 Ont. L.R. 356) that the property in and ownership of the goods never passed out of K. and the transaction was not one within the terms of R.S.O. [1897] ch. 148, sec. 41.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial[2] in favour of the defendant.\nThe facts of this case are stated in the following admissions signed by counsel for the respective parties.\n\u201cThe plaintiff and the defendant by their counsel for the purposes of this action mutually agree to admit the following to be facts, to be added to by such evidence as either party sees fit to offer at the trial: \u201cThe defendant was a manufacturing furrier, also engaged in the retail fur trade, during the time that the matters in question arose. The plaintiff is the assignee for creditors of the Richard Simpson Company, Limited, lately doing business on Yonge street, Toronto. The Richard Simpson Company became insolvent and assigned to the plaintiff on or about January 16th, 1903.\n\u201cEarly in November of 1902, the Richard Simpson Company and the defendant entered into an arrangement by which the defendant agreed to place with the Richard Simpson Company to be exposed for sale, at their place of business, certain furriers\u2019 goods for which that company gave to the defendant, amongst others, the receipts produced. The goods so to be placed were manufactured by the defendant, but bore no mark or label containing the name or address of the manufacturer. The arrangement was verbal, no attempt being made to comply with the provisions of R.S.O. ch. 149 (if applicable, which is not admitted by the defendant), nor with the provisions of sec. 41, R.S.O. ch. 148 (if applicable, which likewise is not admitted by the defendant). The Richard Simpson Company were to have the right to sell any of such goods to whom they pleased, without reference to Kahnert, and for such prices as they saw fit, but the company undertook to pay to the defendant within twenty-four hours after any sales being made of such goods, the amounts of the net cash prices placed by the defendant upon such goods so sold, and the company had the right to retain for itself any sum realized on such sales over and above such fixed net prices. The defendant had the right to withdraw from the Richard Simpson Company any or all such goods at any time. During the season certain goods so placed were at the defendant\u2019s request returned to him by the Richard Simpson Company. Any of the said goods unsold by the Richard Simpson Company, at the end of the season, were to be returned to the defendant. The goods were at first placed with the Richard Simpson Company only until the 1st of January, but later it was arranged that they might be kept for an indefinite further period. By agreement these goods, while with the Richard Simpson Company, were to be at their risk as to loss or destruction by burglary, fire, etc. When these goods were sent out by the defendant they were entered in a special account in his shipping book at pages 132 and 133. Whenever the Richard Simpson Company remitted proceeds of sales of such goods the defendant entered the same as part of his cash sales upon the date of receipt as \u201ccash received from sales of merchandise.\u201d\n\u201cCertain other goods were sold by the defendant to the Richard Simpson Company during the same period on terms of credit, 7 per cent. off for payment within thirty days, and 10 per cent. off for payment within ten days. These goods were entered in a separate account in the shipping book of the defendant at page 250. Some of this latter class of goods, taken in the first place by the Simpson Company on approbation, were retained by them without payment and treated by both parties as part of the account first above mentioned.\n\u201cAt the time of the assignment to the plaintiff the Richard Simpson Co. had a large quantity of the aforesaid goods in their possession, which the plaintiff went into possession of along with the general stock, but which, on demand of the defendant and under threat of action, the plaintiff handed over to the defendant, without prejudice to the rights of creditors of the Richard Simpson Co., and pursuant to the terms of four certain letters now produced which passed between Messrs. Anglin & Mallon, acting for the defendant, and the plaintiff and his solicitor. The goods so handed over are, with the exception of one article (a mink ruff, No. 533, $15.00), the articles contained in the list produced and market Exhibit 1 on the examination of the defendant for discovery. All the articles contained in the said list were articles placed with the Richard Simpson Co. under the agreement first above mentioned, except No. 16, a coon and Persian caperine, $15.50; No. 19, coon and Persian caperine, $15.50; No. 20, Isabella fox ruff (557) $30.00, and No. 29, mink ruff (533) $15.00, not returned. These four articles were sent to the Richard Simpson Co. upon sale account, but \u201con approbation,\u201d and were never returned by the Simpson Co. They remained in the hands of the company at the time of the assignment, either still on approbation or treated by the parties as part of the goods under the agreement first above mentioned.\nFRANK A. ANGLIN,\nCounsel for defendant.\nW.R. SMYTH,\nCounsel for plaintiff.\u201d\nThe plaintiff contended that under these facts the arrangement was governed by sec. 41 of R.S.O. [1897] ch. 148, which is as follows:\n41\u2014(1) In case of an agreement for the sale or transfer of merchandise of any kind to a trader or other person, for the purpose of resale by him in the course of business, the possession to pass to such, trader or other person, but not the absolute ownership until certain payments are made or other considerations satisfied, any such provision as to ownership shall be against creditors, mortgagees, or purchasers be void and the sale or transfer shall be deemed to have been absolute, unless. * * * A.C. Macdonell for the appellant cited Ex parte White[3]; Mason v. Lindsay[4].\nDay for the respondent referred to Helby v. Matthews[5]; Whitfield v. Brant[6]; Ex parte Bright[7].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014It seems to me clear that Simpson & Co. never bought the goods now in question from the defendant, and never were possessed of them animo domini. They were invested by the defendant with the jus dispondendi, but not exclusively.\nThe fact that the defendant had at any time, as long as they remained in the company\u2019s store, the right to have them returned to him, at his will, seems to me totally incompatible with any claim of ownership by the company. It was surely his goods that would be so returned, not the company\u2019s, and on the date of the assignment they had never ceased to be his property. And I fail to see how a sale can be implied where on the face of the agreement there was actually no sale.\nAs to those now in question the defendant never had an action against the company for goods sold and delivered. He never was as to those a creditor of the company. That he became their creditor by the assignment, as appellant would contend, seems to me untenable. I cannot see that this assignment cut out the defendant from the right he had under the agreement of ordering the goods back to his own store; nor how it would have the effect of forcing on the company a purchase which, under their agreement, they had a right to make but never made.\nIt is argued, however, by the appellant that by sec. 41, ch. 148 R.S.O., the absolute ownership of the goods must, as against him, be deemed to have passed to the company. That section reads as follows:\nIn case of an agreement for the sale or transfer of merchandise of any kind to a trader or other person, for the purpose of resale by him in the course of business, the possession to pass to such trader or other person, but not the absolute ownership until certain payments are made or other considerations satisfied, any such provision as to ownership shall as against creditors, mortgagees or purchasers be void and the sale or transfer shall be deemed to have been absolute * *\nThis case, in my opinion, is not governed by that section.\nThese goods cannot be said to have been intended for a resale by the company. The word resale would import, in this case, if appellant\u2019s contention prevailed, that the defendant had sold them, but he never did. Neither was there any agreement for a sale by the defendant to the company of goods to be resold by them. There was to be no sale at all by the defendant to the company at any time, where the company sold the goods to third parties in the course of their business. When the company sold it was not their title to the ownership of the goods that they passed to the purchasers; they never had it. Till then it had remained in the defendant. The statute contemplates a sale or transfer by which a conditional or qualified ownership passed, or an ownership with a resolutory clause on default of payment, such as was the case, for instance, in Forristal v. McDonald[8], or Banque d\u2019Hochelaga v. Waterous Engine Works Co.[9] When it says that the absolute ownership shall only pass under certain subsequent conditions it assumes that a qualified ownership had previously passed. Now here, I repeat, none whatever had passed to the company as to the goods now in question.\nHad Kahnert failed instead of the company and assigned to his creditors, these goods would have passed to his assignee. The company could not have refused to deliver them up on the ground that they were their property.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nSEDGEWICK, DAVIES and NESBITT JJ. concurred.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The defendant delivered some goods to the Richard Simpson Company, and got them back, after the company had made an assignment, without prejudice to the rights of either party to this suit. The learned trial judge, Sir William Meredith, stated in his judgment the facts upon which the questions raised here are to be disposed of:\nThe arrangement was that the Simpson Company might sell the whole or any part of the goods to whomsoever they chose, and for such price, and on such terms as they might see fit; but they were, whenever a sale was made, to pay in cash to the defendant the price of the article sold, according to a price list which was furnished to them by the defendant when the goods were from time to time delivered to the Simpson Company. The company had also the right, according to the testimony of the defendant himself, whether they had made a sale or not, to become the owners of the whole or any part of the goods at the prices named in the list, and they had also the right at any time to return the whole or any of the goods which remained unsold.\nUpon this concise statement of facts, which the appellant admits to be correct, it is contended that the Simpson Company having made an assignment to the appellant under and pursuant to R.S.O. 1897, ch. 147, and amending Acts, the title to the goods in question passed to him as such assignee. The company never did anything in the way of asserting the right to become purchasers of these goods.\nAs between the parties the respondent was entitled at the time of the assignment to a re\u2011delivery of the goods by the Simpson Company.\nIt is claimed, however, that the provisions of sec. 41 of the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgages Act, R.S.O. ch. 148, had the effect upon and by virtue of this assignment of defeating this right and vesting the title to the goods in the assignee. The section reads as follows:\n41.\u2014 (1) In case of an agreement for the sale or transfer of merchandise of any kind to a trader or other person for the purpose of resale by him in the course of business, the possession to pass to such trader or other person, but not the absolute ownership until certain payments are made, or other considerations satisfied, any such provision as to ownership shall as against creditors, mortgagees or purchasers be void, and the sale or transfer shall be deemed to have been absolute, unless * * in writing, etc.\nThe transaction not being in writing is not within the exception in the section, and, therefore, the questions raised must turn upon the interpretation of these words I have quoted.\nIt is not possible to call what took place a sale. It is urged that it was a transfer, and that as such it is within this section.\nI am unable to understand how this helps the appellant unless the word \u201ctransfer\u201d is given an unusual meaning and one that does not truly and correctly represent the transaction here.\nThere was nothing in the transaction in the way of the conveyance of right, title or property.\nThe company became merely the bailees of the property; and their right to it or dominion over it never extended beyond that, and never was intended to ex- tend beyond that, until something should be done that never was done.\nThe section presupposes, by its very words, that there is some provision made between the parties; by the agreement it strikes at, that relates to such a conditional or suspensive ownership as if got out of the way would leave the property vested in the debtor. It makes or purports to make \u201csuch provision as to ownership\u201d as against creditors void.\nThere was only one possible thing here that had or could have had any relation to ownership, and that was the option of the bailee to purchase. If that is made void what remains?\nHaving regard to the long past history by which the common law rights governing dealing with personal property have been invaded by one restriction after another for the purpose of protecting innocent purchasers and creditors, or one or other of them, and the principles of interpretation applicable to such legislation, I think it would be manifestly erroneous to give this latest attempt a wider meaning than the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal have given it.\nOne can imagine many cases in every day\u2019s transactions in which, by giving to this section the meaning we are urged to give it here, the property of innocent men would be exposed to seizure under execution for debts they knew not of.\nIt is only the same right as an execution creditor would have that this kind of assignee has.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.R.

On failure to take proper measures in order to ascertain these facts and obtain a clear title to the bills and goods, any pledge thereof must be assumed to have been made subject to all rights of such consignee. The Chief Justice dissenting.\nHeld, per Taschereau C.J. dissenting:\u2014Where a sale of goods has been completed by actual tradition and delivery the mere absence of the consignee's indorsement upon shipping bills representing the goods made in the name of the vendor cannot have the effect of reserving any right of property in the vendor. If the goods have been sold upon terms of credit, the unpaid vendor has no right to revendicate such goods after they have passed into the possession of a third person in the ordinary course of business, and, in the present case, on failure of the conservatory seizure and in the absence of any right of the plaintiff to revendicate the goods, the alternative relief prayed for by his action should not be granted.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, by which the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal (Pagnuelo J.) ([1]) in favour of the plaintiff was reduced to $2,667.10 and modified accordingly.\nThe following statement of the circumstances of the case is taken from the notes of reasons for the judgment of His Lordship, Mr. Justice Pagnuelo, at the trial.\n\"The plaintiff sued for the recovery of 5,324 bales of hay and 54 bills of lading granted by several railway companies to the plaintiff in May, 1894, and prayed that the defendants should be ordered to return the hay and the bills of lading, and in default, condemned to pay him $5,244.50. He alleged that he agreed to sell hay to the firm of Marsan & Brosseau at $8.50 per ton; that he loaded the hay on cars at various railway stations and took said bills of lading, from the railway companies, in his own name, consigned to himself at New London, Conn., New York and Boston; that he forwarded the bills to Marsan & Brosseau as evidence of the shipments, without being indorsed by him, thereby retaining the ownership in the hay represented by the bills of lading; that there were in all 54 cars of a value of $5,244.50; that Marsan & Brosseau illegally transferred the bills of lading to the Ontario Bank, without the plaintiff's indorsement and without paying for the hay; that Marsan & Brosseau are notoriously insolvent, and were insolvent at the time of the transfer by them of said bills of lading to the bank, to the knowledge of said bank; that Marsan & Brosseau had no right to transfer the bills of lading to the bank and the bank acquired no right in them, gave no value and received them in fraud of the rights of the plaintiff, and for the purpose of obtaining an undue preference over the creditors of Marsan & Brosseau; and the plaintiff also prayed for the resiliation of the sale by him to Marsan & Brosseau and to be acknowledged as the owner of the hay and of the bills of lading;\n\"The bank, after a general denial, pleaded that Marsan & Brosseau became the owners of the hay sold by plaintiff to them; that the bills of lading were not made with the object of enabling plaintiff to retain the ownership of the hay until paid for; that plaintiff well knew that Marsan & Brosseau had no means to pay for the hay except either by delivering the hay and obtaining the money from the purchaser, or by pledging the bills of lading with a bank for the purpose of obtaining advances thereon; that the hay in question was intended to be shipped to foreign parts, and the bills of lading were delivered to Marsan & Brosseau to enable them to finance the adventure; that at the time of the institution of the action the bills of lading were not in the possession of the bank, nor the hay represented thereby; that at the time of the transactions Marsan & Brosseau were believed to be merchants in good standing and solvent, and the bank dealt with them and made advances in good faith, in the usual course of business and for valuable consideration; it denied having received the bills of lading in fraud of the rights of the plaintiff or of the creditors, or for the purpose of obtaining an undue preference over them; that neither the hay nor the bills of lading were found nor seized in the possession of the bank, which is not liable to return the same nor to pay the value of the hay.\n\"There was no allegation or pretension that the bills of lading were ever indorsed by anybody, and there is the allegation that the hay and bills of lading were no longer in the bank's possession. This last allegation, as a matter of fact, was not true, because the bills of lading were under its control and the hay was under its control, in fact being on the way at the time and still on this continent.\n\"It appears from the evidence that the hay in question was to be shipped to England to be sold there, and that the railway receipts or inland bills of lading were to be exchanged for ocean bills of lading through Marsan & Brosseau or their agents, and sold in England also through the same agents; that plaintiff's name was entered on said railway receipts as shipper and consignee for the purpose of retaining the control over said hay and of retaining the ownership thereof until paid, the plaintiff expecting the ocean bills to be made to his order as shipper and consignee; that Marsan & Brosseau on receiving said railway receipts from plaintiff forwarded to him bills of exchange at 30 days, some of which bills of exchange the plaintiff discounted at his own bank and retired when due; the others he returned to Marsan & Brosseau after they became bankrupt on the 28th of May, 1894; that the bank made advances to Marsan & Brosseau upon these railway receipts, without the personal indorsement of the plaintiff and upon the sole indorsement of Marsan. I have come to the conclusion that all the advances made on that hay were made on the shipping bills or railway receipts, although the manager of the bank declared that 26 cars had been pledged to the bank by Marsan & Brosseau upon ocean bills obtained by them, in their favour, and indorsed by them. * * I find, also, in his evidence, statements which enable me to say that all the advances made on this hay were made on railway receipts.\n\"When the railway companies were presented with those railway receipts with the name of Gosselin and then the name of Marsan & Brosseau on, they would make no objection and take the signature of Gosselin as being genuine; therefore they made no objection to giving in their stead ocean bills to the order of Marsan & Brosseau. That was done to the knowledge of Mr. King all the time. * * He explains that at the time of the suspension of business by Marsan & Brosseau the bank had on hand 20 shipping bills, and these shipping bills were transferred by the bank to their own agents without any indorsement at all, and * * ocean bills were obtained * * without indorsement, so the bank had to give a guarantee to the railway companies on account of a large number of cars for which ocean bills were asked to be made in the name of the bank without indorsement by Gosselin. The witness continues 'but in the ordinary course of business Marsan & Brosseau would take those from me on a bailee receipt and exchange them for the ocean bills payable to their order, which I would negotiate in the regular way :\n\"It is evident then from this that the advances were made to Marsan & Brosseau on those railway receipts because Mr. King would not part with them afterwards and deliver them over to Marsan & Brosseau to be exchanged for ocean bills without taking a bailee receipt for them, thereby constituting Marsan & Brosseau the bank's agent to exchange those bills of lading. It was then their property. If it had not been their property, they would have had no business to take a bailee receipt and constitute Marsan & Brosseau the bank's agents for that purpose. * *\n\"So long as Marsan & Brosseau carried on their business, and until they stopped carrying on their business on the 28th May, the bank always used Marsan & Brosseau as their agents to exchange the bills of lading. After that they had no more use for Marsan & Brosseau, and they transmitted these railway receipts to their agent, to make the exchange for ocean bills, and then it was that the bank gave their letter of guarantee to the railway company. * *\n\"Mr. King was sure that the railway receipts were indorsed by Marsan & Brosseau by putting on the name of Gosselin, and so he was aware of the transaction all the time. The evidence goes on; 'Q. You are sure they were indorsed? A. Yes. Q. Then you remember of having these bills of lading in your hands \u2014the original bills? A. No, I do not remember.' How is that if he made all the advances on the railway receipts which he handed back to Marsan & Brosseau as their trustee, and bailee receipts, to be exchanged for ocean bills? He repeats that in so clear a manner that I must take his words, especially when they are against the bank, as I must say he has been a very reluctant witness in the case. He first started by saying that he could give no information, that all the books of the bank relating to this transaction were burnt years ago, when they moved into new offices, and they burned all their old books, and he forgot to tell his assistant not to burn the books relating to this matter. I must say he was very reluctant to give us the facts in this case, but one by one the facts came out and now we have his evidence before us which settles that matter so far as I am concerned.\n\"Marsan & Brosseau would therefore by authority from plaintiff indorse plaintiff's name on said receipts, and the bank knew that Marsan & Brosseau signed plaintiff's name, and never objected; and Marsan & Brosseau acted only as agents and bailees for the bank in exchanging said bills. * *\n\"I now come to that part of the case which has been brought out in the evidence, but was not pleaded specially,\u2014that every time a car was sent to Marsan & Brosseau by the plaintiff, along with the railway receipt, Marsan & Brosseau would at once make a bill of exchange upon themselves for the amount of the car, accept it and send it over to the shipper. Gosselin says that he made this agreement with Marsan & Brosseau. He had already sold them a large quantity of hay for years, and at the time when these cars were loaded they were his debtors for over $3,000. He would not advance them anymore and he made a special bargain with Marsan that he would put the railway receipts to his own order. * *\nAt the time of the action plaintiff's hay was in the possession of the bank under the bills illegally and wrongfully transferred to it by Marsan & Brosseau; the plaintiff never agreed to part with the hay in question until he was paid for the same, and he retained the legal possession and control of the same by shipping on railway receipts to his own order as shipper and consignee; the plaintiff, by taking Marsan & Brosseau's drafts and discounting some of them for his own accommodation, did not thereby release his control of the hay; if Marsan & Brosseau had no . means to pay for the hay except by pledging it, such pledge could not legally be made without the plaintiff's consent and signature when he would see to the payment of his claim, while, by ignoring plaintiff's rights under said railway receipts, Marsan & Brosseau have used the advances made by the bank upon the railway receipts, for the satisfaction of other and previous claims of the bank against Marsan & Brosseau, or of other creditors of Marsan & Brosseau;\n\"The evidence shews that the money received was put to the credit of Marsan & Brosseau, in their bank account, who drew thereon their own cheques to pay previous debts they had at the time, and even that part of the money was used for paying over $5,000 to the bank upon a previous shipment of hay. * * The hay had to be unloaded from the ship, to be stored and other expenses had to be incurred. The bank became nervous, and when they received from Marsan & Brosseau 32 railway receipts, including some of Gosselin's and some from other traders, upon which they wanted advances to be remitted to England, on bills of lading, as I have just stated, Mr. King sent a letter to Marsan & Brosseau returning the bills of exchange, but retaining bills of lading, and saying that he would agree to open to them an overdraft account to the amount of $1,900 upon the 32 cars covered by so many bills of lading that he had in hand; he would not credit them in the bank account for the amount, but he would allow them to overdraw their account to the extent of $1,900, and, if they sent other railway receipts to make 75 altogether, he would raise the overdraft to the amount of $1,000.\n\"Marsan & Brosseau had to submit to this and say nothing. They sent other railway receipts, altogether to the amount of 75, and the power to over-draw was raised to the amount of $4,000; but two days afterwards the bank obtained from Marsan & Brosseau two cheques to the amount of $5,000 to cover the bank against probable loss in England on the hay which had already been shipped; that is, they used the 75 cars to cover previous advances. That was against the law as it stood then, * * at that time it could not be done; that transaction was evidently for the object of covering past advances. Marsan & Brosseau were to overdraw $4,000, but they were asked to give two cheques of over $5,000 to pay drafts sent to England with hay previously shipped to England. There are statements in the record to shew that those $5,000 were paid for a certain number of drafts discounted, so that the money which Marsan & Brosseau obtained on that occasion from the bank * * was used to pay a previous debt of the bank.\n\"It is true that plaintiff intrusted Marsan & Brosseau with the railway receipts for the purpose of exchanging them for ocean bills of lading, as the hay was intended to be shipped to England, but he had reason to expect that the ocean bills would be made to his order, or his consent for the substitution of another consignee on the ocean bills of lading would be asked.\n\"As the transaction took place those railway receipts indorsed by Marsan with Gosselin's name and his Own name, were replaced by ocean bills to the order of Marsan & Brosseau, who handed them over to the bank, and so Gosselin lost all his rights. * *\n\"I consider, therefore, that the plaintiff never parted with the legal possession of his hay, that he never indorsed and never authorized Marsan & Brosseau to indorse for him his name on the said railway receipts.\" * *\nThe following exhibits, filed of record, shew the conditions of the shipping bills which have been referred to:\n\"EXHIBIT D 1.

The questions at issue on this appeal are discussed in the judgments now reported.\nBrodeur K.C., Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and Gosselin for the appellant and cross-respondent, cited McGil-levray v.

Il n'a pas cr\u00fb, et avec raison en face de la preuve, pouvoir soutenir devant nous l'all\u00e9gu\u00e9 de sa d\u00e9claration qu'il n'avait pas fait une vente compl\u00e8te du foin \u00e0 Marsan et ah mais qu'il s'en \u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 paiement, et a enti\u00e8rement abandonn\u00e9 cette pr\u00e9tention. Il n'a pas m\u00eame cit\u00e9 les d\u00e9cisions sur lesquelles il aurait pu en loi l'\u00e9tayer, la preuve le lui eusse-t-elle permis. Forristal v. McDonald([28]); La Banque d'-Hochelaga v. Waterous Engine Works Co. ([29]). Et la cour dont est appel a fait une juste appr\u00e9ciation des faits, quoique je ne puisse adopter les conclusions qu'elle en a tir\u00e9es, en basant son jugement, non pas sur une promesse de vente ou une vente sous condition suspensive ou r\u00e9solutoire mais bien sur une vente actuelle et effective. \"La vente \u00e9tait parfaite,\" dit justement le savant juge en chef Lacoste au nom de la cour. Et le demandeur, Gosselin, ne le conteste pas dans son factum, pas plus qu'il ne l'a fait \u00e0 l'audition.\nIl l'a d'ailleurs admis sous serment dans son affidavit pour jugement contre Marsan et al. La cour de premi\u00e8re instance avait aussi en termes pr\u00e9cis annul\u00e9 la vente; c'\u00e9tait, en termes non \u00e9quivoques, admettre qu'il y en avait eu une; on n'annule pas ce qui n'a jamais exist\u00e9.\nOr, il en \u00e9tant ainsi comme question de fait, il en ressort n\u00e9cessairement qu'en loi Marsan et al. sont devenus instanter propri\u00e9taires absolus de ce foin. Et la pr\u00e9somption, qu'en mettant les connaissements ou lettres de voiture en son nom le demandeur s'en \u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, est compl\u00e8tement \u00e9cart\u00e9e.\nLa vente est parfaite (d\u00e9cr\u00e8te l'art. 1472 C.C.), par le seul consentaient des parties quoique la chose ne soit pas encore livr\u00e9e.\net le contrat d'ali\u00e9nation d'une chose certaine et d\u00e9termin\u00e9e rend l'acqu\u00e9reur propri\u00e9taire de la chose par le seul consentement des parties, quoique la tradition actuelle n'en ait pas eu lieu, dit Fart. 1025; et ceci s'applique aussi bien aux tiers qu'aux parties contractantes, dit Fart. 1027; de Folleville, de la Possession des Meubles, page 161; Demolombe, Oblig. vol. 1er. No. 409. Ainsi les cr\u00e9anciers du demandeur n'auraient plus eu le droit de saisir entre ses mains le foin ainsi vendu \u00e0 Marsan et al.; Demolombe, Oblig. vol. 1er, No. 472; Larombi\u00e8re, Oblig. sous art. 1141, No. 18; Young v. Lambert ([30]). Et pourquoi? Parceque tant vis-\u00e0-vis les tiers que vis-\u00e0-vis le demandeur, Marsan et al. \u00e9taient devenus les propri\u00e9taires actuels du foin, m\u00eame en supposant qu'ils n'en auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis de suite en possession. Le demandeur n'avait certainement plus le droit, lui, de le vendre ou donner en nantissement \u00e0 la banque ou \u00e0 qui que ce f\u00fbt. Quelqu'un cependant devait avoir ce droit. On ne peut, comme le pr\u00e9tendrait le demandeur, concevoir, sous les circonstances, l'id\u00e9e d'un article de commerce frapp\u00e9 d'indisponibilit\u00e9. Et, si le demandeur n'avait plus le jus disponendi c'est parce qu'\u00e0 Marsan et al. seuls il \u00e9tait pass\u00e9. Il est impossible pour le demandeur de pr\u00e9tendre qu'il \u00e9tait convenu entre ses acheteurs et lui qu'ils n'auraient pas le droit de revendre. C'\u00e9tait pour revendre, et uniquement pour revendre, et revendre avec toute la diligence possible, et il le savait, qu'ils achetaient. Et de plus, il n'ignorait pas qu'ils \u00e9taient, dans l'intervalle, dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 de le payer aux termes convenus sans obtenir sur nantissement du foin les fonds n\u00e9cessaires pour ce faire. Si le demandeur e\u00fbt insist\u00e9 sur la condition que ses acheteurs n'auraient pas, quoique propri\u00e9taires, le droit de revendre ou mettre en gage, ces derniers lui auraient tout simplement dit qu'il devait bien savoir qu'avec cette condition toute transaction entre eux \u00e9tait impossible.\nMaintenant, si Marsan et al. sont devenus propri\u00e9taires du foin, ils ont pu transf\u00e9rer leurs droit \u00e0 la banque qui, en vertu des articles suscit\u00e9s, est devenue propri\u00e9taire absolue m\u00eame avant tradition; 2 Aubry & Eau, par. 183, No. 6. Sa bonne foi n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en doute ni par l'une ni par l'autre des cours provinciales et ne pouvait l'\u00eatre.\nLe demandeur repose toute sa cause contre la banque sur ce pr\u00e9tendu manque de tradition. Mais, en fait et en loi, sa position n'est pas tenable. Marsan et al., d\u00e8s leur achat, laissant de c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour le moment le fait de la tradition manuelle des connaissements, sont devenus par leurs agents et voituriers, les seuls possesseurs actuels, man\u00fb, de ce foin, possesseurs pro emptors. Ils en ont d\u00e8s lors eu en fait le contr\u00f4le exclusif, corpore et animo dominantis, engag\u00e9 les voituriers, pay\u00e9 le fret, et auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 les seules victimes, avenant le cas de perte in transitu. A eux seuls auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 payables les dommages qu'auraient pu causer les fautes des voituriers dans le transport. Les faits de la cause repoussent compl\u00e8tement la proposition du demandeur, qu'en mettant les connaissements en son nom, il se soit r\u00e9serv\u00e9 la possession l\u00e9gale. Ces connaissements ne sont pas m\u00eame \u00e0 ordre, mais en son seul nom comme personne d\u00e9nomm\u00e9e. Lyon Caen & Renault, 5 Dr. Comm. No. 701, 713, et seq.; Buch\u00e8re, Valeurs Mobili\u00e8res, No. 451. Et d'ailleurs, ce n'est pas la possession l\u00e9gale des connaissements dont il s'agit, c'est la possession de fait, la possession mat\u00e9rielle du foin m\u00eame.\nOr cette possession de fait, le demandeur s'en \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement dessaisi. Sa propre d\u00e9claration l'all\u00e8gue sp\u00e9cialement. Son jugement contre Marsan et al. en est, d'ailleurs, une admission non \u00e9quivoque. Il a cess\u00e9 de poss\u00e9der animo dominantis ce qu'il avait vendu. Et c'\u00e9tait dans l'unique but de permettre \u00e0 ses acheteurs de revendre aussit\u00f4t possible ou d'obtenir de la banque, si n\u00e9cessaire, les avances pour le payer lui-m\u00eame, qu'il les avait constitu\u00e9s les porteurs des connaissements et les possesseurs du foin. M oisons Bank v. Janes ([31]); Fowler v. Meildeham([32]). Il n'avait aucune intention d'aller lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 New York ou \u00e0 Boston, et savait parfaitement qu'il lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible d'exiger que les connaissements lui fussent retourn\u00e9s pour son endossement avant que la revente f\u00fbt possible. Il doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9, sous les circonstances, avoir autoris\u00e9 Marsan et al. \u00e0 transf\u00e9rer les connaissements et \u00e0 signer son nom au dos d'iceux, si n\u00e9cessaire. Il n'a obtenu leur consentement \u00e0 acheter qu'\u00e0 la condition qu'ils pourraient revendre ou mettre en gage \u00e0 leur gr\u00e9. Il esp\u00e9rait, sans doute, qu'ils le consid\u00e9raient comme cr\u00e9ancier privil\u00e9gi\u00e9, et verraient \u00e0 ce qu'il f\u00fbt le premier pay\u00e9 sur le produit de leur revente, et c'est dans ce seul but qu'il a mis les connaissements en son nom tout en les mettant en possession actuelle du foin comme propri\u00e9taires. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 de\u00e7u en cela; ses acheteurs l'ont tromp\u00e9, mais la banque ne doit pas \u00eatre la victime. Sur lui seul doivent peser les cons\u00e9quences de l'abus par ses acheteurs de la confiance qu'il avait repos\u00e9e en eux.\nJe retourne \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention du demandeur qu'en mettant les connaissements \u00e0 son nom seul, il n'est pas cens\u00e9 avoir livr\u00e9 le foin \u00e0 Marsan et al., en supposr\u00e0nt que ce moyen lui compete malgr\u00e9 l'admission contraire que comporte le jugement qu'il a pris contre eux. Lui est-il possible de soutenir que les tiers dans le commerce, et surtout la banque vis-\u00e0-vis qui depuis longtemps il avait montr\u00e9 la plus grande confiance dans Marsan, \u00e9taient tenus de traiter la tradition manuelle \u00e0 eux des connaissements comme illusoire, sans but, et sans aucune cons\u00e9quence? Mais pourquoi les leur remettre, pourquoi les en faire les porteurs? N'\u00e9tait-ce pas pour qu'ils s'en servent, pour qu'ils en retirent le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice? Ces connaissements constituaient des droits incorporels, des titres \u00e0 des droits contre les voituriers, des indicia de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Pickering v. Busk ([33]); Cole v. North Western Bank([34]). Or ces titres, quoique non \u00e0 ordre ou au porteur, pouvaient \u00eatre vendus ou c\u00e9d\u00e9s. Ils n'\u00e9taient pas frapp\u00e9s d'inali\u00e9nabilit\u00e9. Or comment pouvaient-ils \u00eatre vendus ou c\u00e9d\u00e9s? Par la d\u00e9livrance manuelle, dit la loi, ou par un transport formel. La d\u00e9livrance \u00e0 Marsan et al. les en constituait vis-\u00e0-vis les tiers les acqu\u00e9reurs par le fait m\u00eame. La vente des cr\u00e9ances et droits d'action contre des tiers est parfaite entre le vendeur et l'acheteur par la d\u00e9livrance du titre, s'il est sous seing priv\u00e9, et, vis-\u00e0-vis le vendeur ou c\u00e9dant, l'acqu\u00e9reur ou cessionnaire en est de suite saisi. L'article 1570 C.C. le dit express\u00e9ment.\nEt, dit l'art. 1494, la d\u00e9livrance des choses incorporelles se fait par la remise des titres. M\u00eame eussent-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ordre l'endossement de ces connaissements par Gosselin n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire pour les transmettre; leur n\u00e9gociation aurait pu se faire au moyen d'une cession ordinaire et dans les termes du droit commun. C'est ce que la cour de cassation a express\u00e9ment d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans plusieurs causes, entre autres celles cit\u00e9es au No. 35 de Sirey, Code Annot\u00e9, sous l'art. 1690, C.N.; voir 4 Bravard, Dr. Comm. page 382; Lyon Caen & Eenault, vol. 5, Dr. Comm. No. 701. Et par l'art. 1573, il n'y a que les billets pour la livraison de grains ou autres choses payables \u00e0 ordre qui peuvent \u00eatre transport\u00e9s par endossement. Les titres nominatifs \u00e0 une personne d\u00e9nomm\u00e9e, comme ceux au porteur, sont donc transport\u00e9s par la simple d\u00e9livrance. Et l'art. 2421 qui ne donne le droit de transporter un connaissement par endossement que pour un connaissement \u00e0 ordre laisse \u00e0 douter si un endossement par Gosselin de titres payables \u00e0 lui seul comme ceux-ci l'\u00e9taient, aurait conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 ses acheteurs plus ou m\u00eame autant de droits que la d\u00e9livrance manuelle Ta fait. Ils sont devenus \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit investis du jus disponendi et des connaissements et du foin.\nLaissant ces consid\u00e9rations de c\u00f4t\u00e9, \u00e0 tous points de vue de la cause, le demandeur e\u00fbt-il quelques droits contre la banque, son action en revendication et en demande de r\u00e9solution de la vente \u00e0 Marsan et al. faute de paiement du prix ne peut-\u00eatre maintenue.\nD'abord par Fart. 2268 du Code Civil, la possession actuelle par la banque \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire, tant des connaissements que du foin en question m\u00eame, emp\u00eache la revendication, la banque \u00e9tant aux droits de commer\u00e7ants en pareilles mati\u00e8res et les ayant acquis dans le cours ordinaire de leur commerce. Beauchamp, Code Civil, sous art. 2268, No. 14. Cet article (il est bon de noter) s'applique maintenant express\u00e9ment au contrat de nantissement par le statut 42 & 43 Vict. ch. 18, sec. 1, pass\u00e9 depuis la d\u00e9cision de la chambre d\u00e9s lords dans le cause de City Bank v. Barrow ([35]).\nPuis par l'art. 1999, le vendeur non pay\u00e9 n'a pas d'action en revendication de la chose vendue si la vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 terme ou si la chose vendue est pass\u00e9e entre les mains d'un tiers qui en a pay\u00e9 le prix. Moss v. Banque de St. Jean([36]); Troplong, Priv. & Hyp. 185 \u00e0 200. Et par l'art. 1543, le droit de r\u00e9solution d'une vente de meubles faute de paiement du prix ne peut-\u00eatre exerc\u00e9 qu'autant que la chose reste en la possession de l'acheteur, en sa possession physique et ostensible.\nOr. ici, le demandeur l'admet, la vente \u00e0 Marsan \u00e9tait \u00e0 terme; de plus, il l'all\u00e8gue lui-m\u00eame, la banque \u00e9tait, lors de l'institution de l'action, en possession actuelle et du foin et des connaissements, et elle en avait pay\u00e9 le prix. B\u00e9darride, Achats et Ventes, No. 328. En ne saisissant pas le foin in transitu entre les mains du voiturier, le demandeur a admis que Marsan et al. et la banque en avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en possession actuelle. Rogers v. Mississippi and Dominion S.S. Co. ([37]) et causes y cit\u00e9es. Le demandeur, sentant la force de cette objection \u00e0 son action telle que form\u00e9e, a tent\u00e9 d'y r\u00e9pondre en invoquant l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 contre le texte m\u00eame de la loi. \"Si je n'ai pas droit de revendiquer, dit-il, j'ai un droit d'action contre la banque, soit en dommages, soit parce qu'elle s'est appropri\u00e9 sans droit ce qui m'appartenait,\u2014ou un privil\u00e8ge ou droit de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur ce foin, ou enfin un droit quelconque, et mon action ne peut-\u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9e.\" C'est l\u00e0 une proposition qui n'est pas soutenable. S'il n'a pas droit \u00e0 l'action telle qu'il l'a prise, elle doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e purement et simplement, sauf \u00e0 juger du m\u00e9rite de toute nouvelle action qu'il peut juger \u00e0 propos d'intenter quand elle viendra devant nous. De son action en revendication, qui est une action r\u00e9elle, il ne peut faire une action personnelle. Il est loisible sur une telle demande sans doute, de prendre alternativement des conclusions personnelles. Mais ces conclusions subsidiaires doivent n\u00e9cessairement tomber avec l'action principale, si elle n'est pas fond\u00e9e. Il n'y a lieu \u00e0 les accorder que dans le cas o\u00f9 le droit \u00e0 la demande en revendication \u00e9tant fond\u00e9, les meubles en litige ne peuvent pas \u00eatre remis au demandeur parce qu'ils ne sont plus en la possession du d\u00e9fendeur. Il va de soi que si la demande en revendication est non fond\u00e9e parce que le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e9tait l\u00e9galement propri\u00e9taire en possession, l'action en son entier doit \u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9e. Le fait que la demandeur n'a pu saisir ne peut suppl\u00e9er la base l\u00e9gale qui a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'action d\u00e8s son origine.\nOn nous a cit\u00e9 un grand nombre de causes. J'y applique en bloc le dictum si rationel de Lord Halsbury dans la cause de London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons ([38]):\nNo one case can be an authority for another when the solution rests upon the evidence.\nTant qu'\u00e0 la loi qui r\u00e9git le litige, il ne peut y avoir de doute, et les parties n'en ont point soulev\u00e9. La loi commerciale anglaise n'a de force dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec que dans des cas exceptionels sous aucun desquels la pr\u00e9sente cause tombe.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The whole difficulty, as I understand it, arises from a misconception of the true nature of the contract of sale agreed to by the parties, although I believe the case is a very plain one. The original bills of lading were issued in favour of the appellant, who did nothing to deprive him of the rights he acquired under the same and the agreement; that is the whole case. He should succeed.\nThe contract of sale was perfect and binding by their mere consent as held by the courts below, although the thing sold was not delivered; arts. 1025, 1472, C.C.; but it was subject to a suspensive condition or condition precedent that the property and its legal possession were not to pass till the price was paid; arts. 1087, 1473, 1475, C.C.; and that was the reason why all the railway bills were issued consigned to the appellant, who also appeared as the shipper. Thus both parties had their respective rights secured, the purchaser by getting manual possession of the bills of lading, and the vendor by announcing to the world that the property was not to pass without his order. Neither could sell or pledge without the consent of the other as long as the contract was in force. This is found by the two courts below and proved beyond doubt, in my opinion.\nThe appellant alleges in his declaration that he \"agreed to sell,\" etc. As I understand the meaning of these words they are synonymous to \"did sell,\" for a sale is not possible without an agreement; it is a contract. All the judges seem to have thus considered the transaction. It is suggested that as plaintiff admits in his affidavit for judgment by default against Marsan & Brosseau that they bought from him (achetaient de moi) the hay in question, it was a simple and ordinary sale, and not one suspended by a condition precendent. But this is not the full statement of the plaintiff, for he commences his affidavit by declaring \"Les faits relat\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9claration sont vrais\" The declaration fully sets up the suspensive condition, and when a few lines lower down he says that Marsan & Brosseau bought the hay, he evidently meant and said that they did so in the manner and form alleged in his declaration.\nHe alleges in his declaration:\nThat the said bills of lading for the said hay were forwarded to the said defendants Marsan and Brosseau as evidence to them of each of the said shipments but the said bills were not indorsed by the said plaintiff and the said plaintiff retained, until paid and settled for, the ownership and proprietorship of the said hay as represented by the said bills of lading.\nThis appeal involves no difficult legal question; the law applicable to a case like the present one has been laid down in very clear terms by this court.\nFirst, we have the decision rendered in 1883 in Forristal v. McDonald ([39]), where the plaintiff had assigned crude oil to A., who was a refiner, on the express agreement that no property in the oil should pass until he made up certain payments, and he, without making such payments, had sold the oil to the defendants for value. The court held that the plaintiff, having retained the property in the oil and not having done anything to estop him from maintaining his right of ownership, was entitled to recover from the purchaser the price of the oil.\nIn a more recent case of Banque d'Hochelaga v. Waterous Engine Works Co. ([40]), in 1897, this court held that a sale, made subject to a suspensive condition that the property should not pass until the price be paid, is valid, and that no property passes till the payment is made. This court, by a majority judgment confirming the Court of Appeal, went so far as to hold that in such a case the thing sold, in that instance machinery incorporated with an immoveable, can be claimed by the vendor even against an hypothecary creditor in good faith and for value, although the sale had not been recorded in any public office, or published anywhere, and the incorporation had been done with the consent of the vendor or owner of the machinery. The present case is not similar except as to the effect of a suspensive condition. Chief Justice Strong apparently speaking for the court said, at page 413:\nThe contract of sale may by English law be modified in any way. the parties may agree, and in particular it is open to them to suspend! the operation of the general effect of the contract in respect of the vesting of the property in the vendee, and to provide that it shall not pass until the price is fully paid. It has, however, been assumed, and I accept it as a settled point in the case, that the law of the province of Quebec is to furnish the rule of decision in the present case. No proof of the law of Ontario was made and the court had a right, therefore, to assume that it was identical with the law of Quebec upon the point involved, as indeed it is. Then it cannot for a moment be pretended that there was anything illegal in this stipulation that the vendor should retain the property. Mr. Justice W\u00fcrtele fully explains the principles of the French law on this head, and the authorities he refers to and the extracts he has given from Laurent and Aubry & Rau, beyond all question state the law correctly. To these authorities, that of many other authors might be added.\nThe judges of the two courts below have not referred to the above cases, especially the latter one. As it is a Quebec case they thought that the rule was hardly open to any doubt or discussion. Mr. Justice Pagnuelo, the trial judge, says so in express terms and finds only the facts to be somewhat complicated. They all agree that under the railway bills no property and no legal possession passed to Marsan, Brosseau or anyone else.\nThey only differ upon the appreciation of the facts. Both courts have found, as a matter of fact, that 27 cars of the hay had been pledged to the bank by Marsan & Brosseau under the railway bills of lading, and as to these cars both courts condemned the bank to pay the value of the hay. But as to the balance of the hay contained in the 26 cars, the Court of Appeal would not adopt the conclusion of the trial judge, as, in their opinion, the plaintiff had not sufficiently proved that the hay in these 26 cars had been pledged to the bank, under the railway bills of lading, although no comment is made upon the evidence. As to those cars, simply remarks Chief Justice Lacoste, plaintiff's remedy is against the railway companies.\nThere is no doubt that as to the 27 cars, ocean bills of lading were obtained and delivered to the bank after the advances had been made on the railway bills.\nMr. King, the manager of the bank, admits this in his first deposition. He was, however, \"a very reluctant witness,\" observes Mr. Justice Pagnuelo. The learned judge, in a long opinion where he fully reviews the evidence, finds that all the fifty-three cars had been pledged to the bank under the original railway bills. I am inclined to agree with him in this finding of fact. The bank knew that there were original railway bills for the 26 cars as well as for all the other cars, which had all been held by the bank and were given up only to obtain ocean bills. As much is also admitted by Mr. King:\nQ.\u2014Will you please look at theso shipping bills. I see the name of the consignee there is the plaintiff, not Marsan & Brosseau; how could Marsan & Brosseau negotiate these bills of lading with you without indorsement?\nA.\u2014I understand they were in the habit of negotiating them in that way continuously: I was informed so at the time, and I was informed by the agent of the Central Vermont Railway, that he would issue through bills of lading for any documents of that kind.\nQ.\u2014Would not the other shipping bills be made to the same order, that is the ocean shipping bills?\nA.\u2014No, the ocean shipping bills would be to Marsan & Brosseau.\nBy the court:\nQ.\u2014To Marsan & Brosseau?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nBy plaintiff's counsel:\nQ.\u2014And you were having these ocean bills made to replace these?\nA.\u2014Yes, because Marsan & Brosseau had stopped business at that time, but in the ordinary course of business,' Messrs. Marsan & Brosseau would take those from me on a bailee receipt, and get them exchanged for the ocean bills, payable to their order, which I would negotiate in the regular way.\nQ.\u2014Were you negotiating the transfer of these shipping bills for ocean bills yourself?\nA.\u2014After Messrs. Marsan. & Brosseau stopped business, yes\u2014 not before.\nQ.\u2014And you were asking the railway companies to make the ocean bills in the name of Marsan & Brosseau, for bills of lading that were consigned to other parties?\nA.\u2014No, not after they stopped business. By the court:\nQ.\u2014Before they stopped business?\nA.\u2014Before they stopped business the exchange was made by Marsan & Brosseau,- not by the bank.\nBy plaintiff's counsel:\nQ.\u2014But at the time the exchange was made you had advanced upon the bills of lading?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014You had made your advances upon the bills of lading before the bills of lading were exchanged for ocean bills?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014And it was Marsan & Brosseau who were obtaining this transfer after the bills of lading had been negotiated with you, by advances made by you?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014How was that?\nA.\u2014They would arrange for shipment of the stuff from Boston or New York, or wherever it might be, and I would hand them such receipts as these in trust.\nQ.\u2014Who to?\nA.\u2014To Marsan & Brosseau.\nQ.\u2014You would return the bills of lading in trust to Marsan & Brosseau.\nA.\u2014Yes, on what we call a bailee receipt, and Mr. Marsan or his agent or whoever it might be, would take them to the railway office and bring back to me the ocean bills of lading payable to their order which would be attached and dispatched to the parties to whom they might be selling the stuff on the other side.\nThis language is plain enough. Mr. King has not corrected it in any way, although he was examined twice at great length, first in January, 1903, when he appeared as the first witness for the plaintiff, and the second time a year after when he was the last witness for the bank. The fact that he was the general manager of the bank and the very man who had personally attended to the banking operations of Marsan & Brosseau is of considerable importance. Under arts. 315 and 316 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it is the testimony of the party. The trial judge relies upon that given in the first place when the mind of the witness, interested as he was, was free from the influence of the developments and discoveries of a long enqu\u00eate and trial, and I cannot for a moment suppose that an appellate court is in just as good a position as he was to appreciate that testimony. It is indeed very remarkable that it agrees entirely with the issue as then joined between the parties, as we will see in a few moments.\nIt is said that witness Sutton, the bookkeeper of Marsan & Brosseau, throws a different light upon the transactions. As I read his long deposition he does not; and, moreover, he cannot speak with accuracy on this matter. He speaks from the books of Marsan & Brosseau, kept by him nine years before, which are not complete, the car book and others having been accidentally burnt, and even if complete cannot make evidence against the plaintiff. He declares several times that he had nothing to do with the banking business of the firm, nor the papers necessary to carry it out; all this was always attended to by Mr. Wilfrid Marsan personally; he is sure he never spoke once to Mr. King about it. He says:\nJe n'ai jamais eu de pourparlers avec Monsieur King pour le compte de la banque. * * *\nQ.\u2014Est-ce que vous ne pr\u00e9pariez pas les papiers pour la banque?\nR.\u2014C'est lui m\u00eame, Marsan, qui voyait \u00e0 cela. Il avait cela sous sa charge.\nAnd he repeats several times:\nCe n'est pas moi qui faisais les affaires de banque. C'est Monsieur Marsan qui escomptait cela et puis il m'apportait le resultat.\nHe knows so little of the transactions with the bank and how they were conducted that he never mentions the \"bailee receipts\" referred to by Mr. King. It is not upon testimony of this kind that the evidence of the manager of the bank can be ignored. The trial judge did not do so, and I think no appellate court ought to disturb his finding. This finding is so true that, before the bank got the last ocean bills of lading through W. P. Holland & Co., its agents, after the insolvency of Marsan & Brosseau, it granted to the railway company on the cars on which the hay was being carried, a letter of guarantee that the railway company will not suffer by reason of issuing ocean or through bills without the indorsement by the shippers of the railway bills.\nThe railway companies evidently thought that Marsan & Brosseau, as in previous years, could obtain ocean bills without the order of Gosselin, but that the bank could not after their insolvency. They all could do so validly, by making ocean bills consigned to Gosselin. This might not have been practical, but we have nothing to do with inconveniences. The clear way to get over this difficulty was to disinterest Gosselin and pay what was due to him. By issuing these ocean bills to the order of Marsan & Brosseau or W. P. Holland & Co., the railway companies misunderstood their obligation or duty; possibly they may be responsible to Gosselin for the loss, as suggested by the Court of Appeal, but their mistake did not give a title to the bank, because it knew that these ocean bills were substitutes for the railway bills issued in favour of appellant; in fact this substitution was done at the request of the bank. The Court of Appeal so held as to 27 cars and I cannot see how, on the evidence, a distinction can be made as to the other cars.\nIn neither the declaration nor the pleas is a word said of the ocean bills of lading. Issues are raised between the parties as to the original railway bills only, and the bank claims as holder of the said bills and not as holder of ocean bills. When examined sur faits et articles, a short time after joining the issue before the trial, the bank was asked:\nQ.\u201428. N'est-il pas vrai que vous avez vendu le foin repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par les connaissements (bills of lading) dont il est question en cette action et que vous en avez per\u00e7u le produit?\nR.\u2014Oui.\nThis answer, which has been overlooked by the court of appeal, according to the express enactments of our codes, constitutes what is termed a judicial admission, un aveu judiciare, and the bank cannot afterwards be allowed to contradict it, unless error or mistake be alleged and proved. Arts. 364 to 363, C.P.Q.; art 1245, C.C.\nI, therefore, agree with Mr. Justice Pagnuelo that the bank should pay the price of the 53 cars, namely, the sum of $ 4,934.44, less the sum of $125, admitted by both parties to be a final dividend received by Gosselin out of the insolvent estate of Marsan & Brosseau, the whole with interest and costs, in all the courts.\nI have said nothing of six cars which, as argued by the appellant, with 20 cars, were deducted by the Court of Appeal, because it is conceded that, as to these six cars, no ocean bills were issued at the time any advance was made, and therefore the bank must have obtained the hay upon the original railway bills.\nI might content myself with these few remarks, but as the case is one of considerable commercial importance I will endeavour to review all the objections presented at the argument.\nIt is contended by the bank that the sale was not one for cash, and that consequently under art. 1888, C.C. the vendor could not proceed by revendication, and his action must be dismissed in toto. I am not prepared to concede that it was a credit sale. True, Marsan & Brosseau subsequently sent Gosselin drafts for the full amount of the purchase money to help him to pay the farmers who had supplied the hay; not one draft was met at maturity and many were returned when they assigned a few days after. This course was adopted only to accommodate Gosselin and not to change the character of the sale. The paper was not accepted in payment or settlement of the price. The bills of lading remain in the same position as before; there was no indorsement, no order of delivery, no receipt or discharge, and Gosselin had past experience for not doing so as Marsan & Brosseau were his debtors for over $3,000 upon transactions of the preceding year, which were all closed by railway bills consigned to them. And finally, how can it be said that a sale which is suspended and can take effect only when the price is paid is not a cash sale in law?\nPerhaps it was, in fact, a credit sale, but a credit sale is capable of a suspensive condition and it is especially to protect the vendor in such a case that the condition stipulated by him becomes effective and beneficial.\nBut suppose it was a credit sale in law and in fact, and granting that a writ of revendication could not be resorted to, can we not maintain the main prayer of the declaration that the sale be rescinded and that a personal condemnation be made for the payment of the price against both the parties who appropriated and converted to their own use and benefit both the railway bills and the proceeds of the hay? The revendication was a mere accessory process in the cause which might succeed or not, and finally was not granted by the courts below, as nothing was found to seize, but its defeat cannot be, and in the opinion of the two courts below was not, fatal to the demand, which was entirely independent of the right to revendicate. They maintained the conclusions of appellant's demand, which were as follows:\nThat by the judgment to be rendered herein the said agreement or promise to sell said hay to the said defendants Marsan & Brous-seau be resiliated and cancelled and the said hay declared to be the property of and returned to the said plaintiff and the said bills of lading as representing the same, and the said defendants, Marsan & Brousseau, and the said other defendants the Ontario Bank, ordered to return to said plaintiff the said above mentioned hay and the said bills of lading as representing the same within such delay as this honourable court shall fix, and in default of which that the said defendants may be jointly and severally adjudged and condemned to pay and satisfy to the said plaintiff the said sum of five thousand two hundred and forty-four dollars and fifty cents with interest.\nIn the face of arts. 1065, 1087, 1473, 1497, and 1543, of the Civil Code, it cannot be seriously contended that they have erred in doing so. Chief Justice Lacoste correctly, it seems to me, lays down the true rule of law in these few words:\nC'est en vertu d'une r\u00e8gle commune aux contrats en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral reproduite dans l'article 1065 que Gosselin exerce son droit. \"Dans le cas de contravention du d\u00e9biteur (dit cet article) le cr\u00e9ancier peut demander la r\u00e9siliation du contract d'ou na\u00eet l'obligation ! \" Ici l'obligation de payer le prix n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie, le vendeur peut demander la r\u00e9solution du contrat de vente. Cette r\u00e9gie est confirm\u00e9e par l'article 1545 C.C. au titre de la vente. S'il n'en \u00e9tait pas ainsi, le vendeur serait dans une situation absurde. Marsan & Brousseau \u00e9tant en faillite, l'article 1497 le dispensait d'effectuer la livraison et il serait toujours rest\u00e9 en possession du foin qui n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Telle n'a pu \u00eatre la volont\u00e9 du l\u00e9gislateur.\nThe respondent insisted strongly upon arts. 1488, 1489 and 2268, of the Civil Code, as permitting a pledge consented to as security for advances made or to be made under the Quebec statute passed in 1879, 42 & 45 Vict. ch. 19. But there are in those articles, as well as in that statute, several conditions required for the validity of the sale or pledge. It is not sufficient that the goods be obtained from \"a trader dealing in similar articles.\" The pledgee must be in possession (arts. 1966, 1970 C.C.) and in good faith, and finally, under art. 1966 of the Civil Code, no pledge can take place except \"with the owner's consent,\" expressed or implied. The French version, having a comma before the word \"with,\" shews plainly that these words apply to the whole article. This disposes of the proposition that the bank acquired under ocean bills issued in favour of Marsan & Brosseau, and indorsed by them to the bank. They were not owners.\nThe bank cannot claim to have acted in good faith in this matter in a legal sense at least. It was informed from the beginning and knew, and the whole world was informed by the appellant in the railway bills, that he remained the proprietor and in legal possession of the hay represented by the railway bills. If anyone was willing to make advances on the security of these bills, knowing that he was not dealing with the legal possessor and owner, he should have made inquiry and ascertained the facts, and either obtained the consent of the consignee or at least provided for the price agreed to be paid to Gosselin; and if he failed to do so, it was at his own risk and peril. Whether the bills of lading are to be considered to be negotiable or not, a delivery order from the consignee or his receipt for the price, or at least a tender of the same, was necessary to relieve and free the bills of the condition which was attached to the same. I think the regular course would have been an indorsement by him, for bills of lading, whether payable to order or not, are negotiable by the law merchant, subject to certain limitations, as provided for in arts. 1745, 2421, C.C., and 52 Vict. ch. 30 (D.).\nThe appellant relied upon the Bank Act of 1890 in force at the time these transactions took place. He holds that this Act amends the common law, the Civil Code, as far as banks are concerned, and I agree with him in that contention. Section 64 so declares in express terms. Then comes section 73, which enacts that a bill of lading acquired by a bank\nshall vest in the bank, from the day of the acquisition thereof, all the right and title of the previous holder or owner thereof.\nMarsan & Brosseau had no right or title whatever except on the payment of the price agreed to and, therefore, had nothing to transfer except on the fulfilment of that condition.\nThe trial judge has dealt at great length with the alleged money advances made by the bank for the bills of lading. He expresses the view that no extemporaneous advances were made as required by the Bank Act, sec. 75. The evidence shews that Marsan & Brosseau had been insolvent for many months previously, and that when they failed they had liabilities exceeding $ 100,000 and a very small estate; it paid only five cents on the dollar. When they got plaintiff's hay in May, 1894, they had their bank account largely overdrawn all the time, to which new overdrafts were allowed when plaintiff's railway bills came in. It may be that these overdrafts do not meet the requirements of sec. 75 of the Bank Act (changed since) as to contemporaneous negotiation. However, I do not propose to pronounce upon this branch of the case. It involves the examination of a complicated and difficult account mixed up with other accounts, and I must confess that I do not feel equal to the task, especially as there is no necessity for the undertaking.\nBefore closing I wish to refer specially to a recent decision of the House of Lords, Farquharson Bros. & Co. v. King & Co.([41]). The appellants, who, according to the head-note,\nwere timber merchants, warehoused with a dock company the timber they imported, and instructed the dock company to accept all transfer or delivery orders signed by their clerk. The clerk had their authority to make limited sales to their known customers. The clerk, under an assumed name, fraudulently sold timber of the appellants to the respondents, who knew nothing of the appellants or of the clerk under his real name, and who bought and paid the clerk for the timber in good faith. The clerk carried out the sales by giving the dock company orders for the transfer of timber into his assumed name, and then in that name giving delivery orders to the respondents:\nHeld, that the appellants, not having held out the clerk to the respondents as their agent to sell to the respondents, were not estopped from denying the clerk's authority to sell; that the clerk, having no title or apparent authority himself, could not give the respondents any title; and that the appellants were entitled to recover from the respondents the value of the timber.\nReferring to the language that His Lordship had used in a previous case, with reference to the maxim invoked also by the present respondents, that when one of two innocent persons must suffer from the fraud of a third, he shall suffer who has enabled such third person to commit the fraud, the Lord Chancellor said, at page 332:\nThe language of the learned judge (Savage C.J.) quoted by me is this: Speaking of a bona fide purchaser, who has purchased property from a fraudulent vendee and given value for it, he says: \"He is protected in doing so upon the principle just stated, that when one of two innocent persons must suffer from the fraud of a third, he shall suffer who, by his indiscretion, has enabled such third person to commit the fraud.\" Those words \"who by his indiscretion\" appear not to have made much impression upon those who were commenting upon this matter. What indiscretion did the appellants here commit? They entrusted their clerk with the delivery orders. It is said that in some exceptional cases he was allowed to make a contract; but what has that got to do with it? No one knew that outside the firm themselves; and you might just as well say in the case of a shopman in a furniture broker's shop, that because he is there, because he habitually delivers goods to the orders which his master receives, that gives him to all the world the power of giving a title if he steals his master's tables and chairs and delivers them to somebody else.\nThe present case is much stronger. Here the public is warned that the apparent possessor of the bills is not owner or real holder. The plaintiff, who is publicly and privately the true and only owner and holder in legal possession, has done nothing to enable Marsan & Brosseau or anyone else to dispose of his property in fraud of his rights. He is not guilty of any indiscretion or imprudence. He has given no authority, even in a limited sense, to sell or pledge. He remained within the limits of his rights. On the contrary the bank, knowingly or innocently it matters very little which, illegally in any event, trespassed upon them. The bank knew that all the railway bills were issued in favour of the appellant; it had received every one of them from Marsan & Brosseau. It knew that they never had the legal possession of and had no title whatever in the hay in question and, therefore, had nothing to transfer except on the fulfilment of the condition as to the payment of the price. Unfortunately it relied upon the wrong willingness of the railway companies to issue ocean bills, without the order or consent of the true owner and possessor, and without providing for the payment of what was due to him under the contract. It cannot be allowed to invoke ignorance of law to advance good faith and avoid responsibility; it got the proceeds of the hay and must pay the price agreed to, although the railway companies may also be liable. Banks when dealing with this kind of security must ascertain that they are contracting with the owner or holder or his agent or assignee before they can get a title. Bills of lading are not like bills of exchange and promissory notes, where actual honesty goes very far to protect the holder. But if a bill or note payable to the order of a payee be taken by a bank or anyone else without the indorsement of the payee, or with a forged indorsement, honesty or honest blundering will not be sufficient to give a title to the bank. Likewise in cases of restrictive indorsements which prohibit or merely restrict the transfer of the ownership of a bill of exchange, the holder is bound to notice the restriction and comply with their requirements; his honesty will not save him from the consequences of his failure in this respect. See sec. 35 of the Bills of Exchange Act, 1890, which reproduces the common law. Surely the holder of a bill of lading cannot be in a better position.\nTo sum up:\n1. The effect of the sale of the hay was suspended till the payment of the price.\n2. The price never having been paid, appellant was entitled to a resiliation of the sale and to demand from the purchasers and the bank the hay in question, and in default the price agreed to.\n3. The manual possession by Marsan & Brosseau or the bank of the bills of lading consigned to the vendor himself and not indorsed by him did not vest them with the legal possession, not the title to the hay which remained in the appellant. 4. The bank cannot be considered in law to be in good faith.\n5. Even if in good faith, the bank did not obtain legal possession or acquire from the true owner or holder of the hay, and no pledge is valid under the Code or the Bank Act without possession by the pledge and consent of the owner of the thing pledged.\n6. The bank only acquired the rights of Marsan & Brosseau subject to the same suspensive condition as to the payment of the price. If the hay realized more than this price the bank may keep the excess; if less it must, however, pay the full price as Marsan & Brosseau were bound to do.\n7. The right of the appellant to resiliation of the sale, and a personal condemnation against both Marsan & Brosseau and the bank, exist notwithstanding the failure of revendication.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal of the appellant should be allowed and the judgment of the Superior Court restored, less a sum of $125, with costs in all the courts and that the cross-appeal of the respondent be dismissed with costs. However, I am alone of that opinion with my brother Idington.\nWe agree that the sale was conditional and that the judgment of the court of appeal should be confirmed, the Chief Justice dissenting. Mr. Justice Davies, moreover, is for allowing the principal appeal as to six cars. As this conclusion is better than that of the court of appeal and meets my views in part, and without withdrawing anything from the above opinion, Justice Idington and I accept the result arrived at by Mr. Justice Davies.\nThe cross-appeal is therefore dismissed with costs and the principal appeal of appellant is allowed in part, and the judgment of the Court of Appeal is modified by adding the price of the six cars, namely, $562.33, less a sum of $125, with interest and costs in all the courts.\nDAVIES J.\u2014In this case so far as the 27 cars of hay are concerned on which the bank made the advances to Marsan & Brosseau on the inland bills of lading deliverable to Gosselin and not indorsed by him, I am of the opinion that the judgment of the Superior Court, confirmed by the Court of Appeal, was right.\nOn this branch of the case I do not desire to add a word to what has been said by the courts below and by my brother Girouard in his judgment, which I have had the privilege of reading.\nWith respect to the 20 car loads of hay as to which the Court of King's Bench reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and held the bank not to be liable to Gosselin, I concur in the judgment of the Court of King's Bench.\nThe question with regard to these 20 cars is whether the advances made by the bank to Marsan & Brosseau were made originally upon the inland bills of lading, which were deliverable to the plaintiff Gosselin, or were made bon\u00e2fide and in good faith in the ordinary course of business to Marsan & Brosseau upon ocean bills of lading deliverable to themselves and indorsed to the bank by them. I am of the opinion that the advances were made in good faith upon the ocean bills of lading, as found by the court of appeal, and that, therefore, the bank is not liable, under the Code, for these 20 cars to the plaintiff in this action.\nThe question is largely, if not entirely, one of fact, and while I admit that the evidence of King, the bank manager, when first given would justify the conclusion that the bank might have made the advances originally on inland bills of lading deliverable to Gosselin, his subsequent explanations when he was recalled, after Sutton, the bookkeeper of Marsan & Brosseau, had been examined, read together with Sutton's positive testimony, place the matter beyond reasonable doubt.\nAs I have the misfortune to differ on this one point of fact only from by brother Girouard, I cite the evidence on which I rely as follows:\nThe witness Sutton, the accountant of Marsan & Brosseau, speaking of the 26 cars of hay, says, at page 72\nThere were 20 cars discounted by drafts attached to through bills of lading.\nand again at pages 187-188:\nQ.\u2014At what date were these cars transferred to the bank, the first 26 or 27 which you have traced in p. 26?\nA.\u2014The first six cars in p. 26 were transferred to the bank on the 21st of May as collateral security to my knowledge; it was upon them that there were advances; that is to say they were given as collateral security and the 20 other cars were discounted on the 17th of May according to our books.\nQ.\u2014Why?\nA.\u2014For discount. There were through bills of lading and drafts on the bank and the bank advanced us upon them. It advanced the amount specified in the margin.\nQ.\u2014Were any cars mentioned in Exhibit p. 26 transferred' to the bank in the form of shipping receipts inland bills?\nA.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014None at all?\nA.\u2014None at all.\nQ.\u2014Not one?\nA.\u2014No; there were ocean bills of lading made for that day on which we transferred to the bank.\nQ.\u2014Were they all in the name of Marsan & Brousseau?\nA.\u2014The through bills of lading. Q.\u2014Is it mentioned in Exhibit p. 26?\nA.\u2014I believe so; they were always made in the name of Marsan & Brousseau.\nQ.\u2014The entries in your books indicate that all your cars enumerated here were transferred in the form of ocean bills of lading obtained from the agents of Marsan & Brousseau?\nA.\u2014Obtained from the railway agents.\nQ.\u2014Marsan & Brousseau were exchanging the shipping receipts for ocean bills?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Have you the date of the discounts?\nA.\u2014Yes, it is on these 26 cars.\nAnd again, at page 190, the same witness Sutton repeats emphatically that there were 27 cars in the form of inland bills, and 20 cars and 6 cars (26 in all) in the form of ocean bills of lading.\nThe evidence of King is as follows:\nQ.\u2014Now, will you take communication of the Exhibit D 2 now filed, and state what that is?\nA.\u2014Mr. Sutton in his evidence stated that some twenty cars had been transferred to the bank which I had been unable to identify when first examined, but on the numbers given by Mr. Sutton, who stated that these cars had been exchanged by the firm of Marsan & Brousseau for ocean bills of lading at their order, and lodged with the bank attached to sterling drafts on London, then I was able to locate them by the sterling drafts and the ocean bills of lading; and I find that these several sterling drafts were discounted in the regular way for the firm of Marsan & Brousseau and put to their credit on the seventeenth of May $2,763.18, and the other on the eighteenth day of May, $3,227.71. These deposit slips correspond with entries in Exhibit p. 24. I file the deposit slips as D 4 and D 5.\nQ.\u2014As in your possession originally, when you were first examined these drafts afforded no information as to the identity of the hay?\nA.\u2014No, there was no possibility of my telling whose draft it was.\nQ.\u2014This was just an ordinary transaction of discount in the regular way of business?\nA.\u2014Yes, the ordinary purchase of a sterling draft with the document attached, and it went to the firm's credit in the usual way of business.\nOn this evidence the Court of Appeal found as a fact, and I fully concur with them, that these 26 cars of hay came to the bank in the form of ocean bills of lading, deliverable to Marsan & Brosseau, and that the advances were made by the bank on these ocean bills in good faith, and so far as 20 cars are concerned that the advances were contemporaneous with the receipt of the bills.\nThe only point on which I differ from the court of appeal is with respect to the advances made upon the last six cars of hay on the 21st May, and just before Marsan & Brosseau assigned.\nIn fact it cannot properly be said to be a difference of opinion, but a finding on a question of fact apparently overlooked by the court of appeal.\nThe trial judge had found that the advances made upon these 6 cars were not contemporaneous advances with the handing over of the bill of lading, but were really \"advances to pay a previous debt due by Marsan & Brosseau to the bank.\"\nIf so it would be in violation of the 75th section of the Bank Act of 1890, which was in force at the time the transaction occurred, and the plaintiff could recover for the value of this hay.\nThe court of appeal appears, as I have said, to have overlooked the point. I followed the argument very closely and also the additional memoranda or supplementary factums which counsel on both sides were asked to give on the special point, and I reached the conclusion after carefully going over the extracts from the bank books produced as exhibits and the evidence, that so far as these 6 cars were concerned 66 tons and 312 lbs. of hay of a value of $8.50 per ton amounting to $562.33, the appeal must be allowed, and that amount added to the judgment in plaintiff's favour, because the debt or advance of the bank was not \"negotiated or contracted at the time of the acquisition by the bank\" of the bill of lading on which it was making the advances, as provided by the 75th section of the Bank Act of 1890.\nThen there was an amount of $ 125 recovered by the plaintiff Gosselin from the estate of Marsan & Brosseau, which, it was agreed at the argument, should be deducted from the amount awarded him as against the bank.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal for the $562.33 and costs, and deduct from the amount of the judgment so increased the said sum of $ 125.00.\nNESBITT J.\u2014I concur with the judgment of the Court of King's Bench.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014It was attempted to rest the appellant's claim on the provisions of the Civil Code, and especially upon arts. 1489 and 2268, coupled with the enabling provisions of the Bank Act.\nIn the light of the case of The City Bank v. Barrow ([42]), which turned upon the same and other provisions, I do not think the Ontario Bank can rely here upon such and other provisions of the Code as may be read with those specially referred to.\nIt is said City Bank v. Barrow (1) no longer applies because of the amendment by 42 & 43 Vict. ch. 18, sec. 1, which reads:\nArticles 1488, 1489 and 2268 of the Civil Code apply to the contract of pledge.\nBut what is the \"contract of pledge?\"\nArt. 1966 of the Code says:\nPledge is a contract by which a thing is placed in the hands of a creditor, or being already in his possession is retained by him with the owner's consent in security for his debt. The owner cannot be said, on the facts here, to have pledged thus the goods in question.\nArt. 1489, C.C., will not operate so as to constitute Marsan the owner.\nNor will this article apply in any way inasmuch as it is intended to have effect only in the cases of goods lost or stolen.\nSee Canada Paper Co. v. The British American Land Co. ([43]), where it was held in appeal by the Court of Queen's Bench for Quebec to have such limited meaning.\nIt is said by Beauchamp, in his notes on art. 1488, CO., that neither that article nor art. 2268 C.C., can have the effect of enabling a valid sale to be made and title acquired by the purchaser of stolen goods.\nDoes art. 1488 C.C., apply to this as a commercial matter?\nIt is impossible here to give the bank a title unless within the provisions of the Bank Act.\nAnd I think, therefore, that art. 1488 C.C., must be read, whatever it means, as impliedly excepting such transactions as get vitality only by and through the Bank Act.\nIt must be confined to those cases where complete operation can be had by virtue of the local law of Quebec quite independently of reliance on anything beyond.\nCan what transpired give the bank any title under the Bank Act?\nThe bank is limited by sec. 64 of that Act to such buying and taking of pledge as authorized by the Act.\nSection 73 enables a bank to acquire:\nAll the right and title of the previous holder or owner thereof, or of the person from whom such goods, wares and merchandise were received and acquired by the bank if the warehouse receipt or bill of lading is made directly in favour of the bank, instead of to the previous holder or owner of such goods, wares and merchandise.\nUnder this section the bank can only receive such title as the owner or person from whom it received the goods.\nIn this case the bank did not acquire any title from the appellant, Gosselin, who held the shipping receipts.\nThe unauthorized act of Marsan & Brosseau in procuring ocean bills of lading to be issued in their names and in fraud of Gosselin did not transfer any title to them, and, therefore, their indorsement of such ocean bills of lading to the bank did not pass any title to the bank.\nMarsan & Brosseau were not the agents of Gosselin for the purpose of having issued any such bills of lading to themselves.\nAll they had any right to do was possibly to see that the ocean bills of lading were issued to Gosselin in exchange for the shipping receipts which were in his name.\nThe interpretation of the expression \"agent\" by sub-sec. 3 of sec. 73 does not in any way extend such limited authority as to give any force or effect to his fraud.\nMarsan & Brosseau were not intrusted with the possession of the goods, nor were the goods consigned to them, nor could the possession of the shipping receipts in Gosselin's name be said to be proof of the possession or control of the goods or authorizing, or purporting to authorize, either by indorsement or by delivery of them, to transfer or receive the goods thereby represented.\nIf the possession of such a shipping receipt could enable one entrusted with it, only for a specified purpose, to pledge the goods it covered, no shipper would be safe in doing anything by an agent.\nIf authority be needed, for elementary propositions such as most of these are, the cases of Cole v. North-Western Bank, [1875] ([44]); and Johnson v. Credit Lyonnais Go. ([45]); upon the Factor's Act, which rests upon and gives expression to the same principle as the provisions of the Bank Act, are ample.\nThe Court of King's Bench in the judgment appealed from recognize that Marsan & Brosseau were not brokers, factors or commission merchants within the provisions of the Civil Code relied upon.\nObviously this is so, and even if they were they were not employed by Gosselin as such and, therefore, derived no authority from such provisions.\nThe court recognizes not only this, but also that the documents in question did not give authority to assign the goods or receive them.\nI am unable to see how giving such documents into the hands of any one could deceive a third party or lead him to believe that the agent receiving them got the right of contracting.\nNo evidence is pointed out in support of this, beyond the document, and the evidence of Gosselin is all the other way.\nThe evidence of Mr. King as he first gave it clearly supports Gosselin and, when his amended statement is fully considered, it reduces the question to this\u2014 that he had no knowledge but the presentation of the ocean bills of lading in Marsan & Brosseau's names.\nThat being the result of fraud could give the bank no better title than Marsan & Brosseau had. Mr. King gives no evidence that he relied on a single thing that Gosselin had done to mislead him.\nThe former dealings between Gosselin and Marsan & Brosseau, as independent seller and buyers respectively, could not furnish such evidence.\nThis is not the case of agents who had long, or in a single case, acted for a principal and had been held out by him as such, where the persons dealing through such agents might claim to throw the loss on the principal.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nSince writing the foregoing I have had the pleasure of reading the judgment of my brother Girouard and what he points out as to the evidence, the procedure and form of action, confirms my previous impressions.\nThe formal judgment of the majority of the court was pronounced, as follows, by His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard:\nThe cross-appeal of the bank is dismissed with costs, the Chief Justice dissenting, and the principal appeal of Gosselin is allowed in part with costs, the Chief Justice and Nesbitt J. dissenting, by adding $562.33 to the amount of the judgment of the Court of Appeal, less $125, and the bank is, therefore, condemned to pay to appellant $3,104.43 with interest thereon from the 7th June, 1894, and costs in all the courts.\nAppeal allowed, in part, with costs; cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant : L.

The statement of the case was as follows:\u2014\n\"1. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company was incorporated in 1881 by Letters Patent issued by the Governor General under the Great Seal of Canada pursuant to section 2 of the Act 44 Victoria, chapter 1.\n\"2. The said Letters Patent are in the form set forth as schedule A to the said Act and the contract between Her late Majesty and the syndicate whose rights were subsequently acquired by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, is also set forth as a schedule to the said Act, which will be found in the statutes of Canada for the year 1881 on pages 3 to 30 both inclusive.\n\"3. On 14th November, 1902, the said company deposited in the Department of Railways and Canals at Ottawa a map and plan of a proposed branch line of railway from a point near Sudbury, on the company's main line of railway, to a point near Kleinburg, on the Ontario and Quebec Railway, all in the Province of Ontario, together with profile and book of reference.\n\"4. On the 18th day of November, 1902, the said map and plan, profile and book of reference were duly sanctioned by the Minister of Railways as appears by his certificate indorsed thereon.\n\"5. Subsequently an application to the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada was made by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for the approval of certain deviations from the said proposed route.\n\"The James Bay Railway Company was incorporated by statute 58 & 59 Victoria (Canada), chapter 50 and thereby authorized to construct a railway from Parry Sound in the Province of Ontario to French River, thence northerly to the easterly side of Lake Wahnapitae and thence to James Bay, and by statute 60 & 61 Victoria (Canada), chapter 47 the James Bay Railway Company was authorized to extend its line from Parry Sound to the City of Toronto or to a point adjacent thereto.\n\"7. Upon the said application to the Board of Railway Commissioners, the James Bay Railway Company filed a protest with the said Board, and being notified of the hearing of the application by the said Board appeared and objected to the approval of the said deviations upon the ground that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company had no power to construct the branch in question for two reasons::\u2014\n\"(a) That the period within which branch lines of railway could be constructed by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company under its statutory and charter authority had expired; and\u2014\n\"(b) That no such authority empowered the construction, at any time, of branch lines in the Province of Ontario.\n\"The following questions, being in the opinion of the said Board of Railway Commissioners questions of law, are submitted by the said board for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada:\n\"I. Has the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, under the legislation, schedules and charter aforesaid, now power to construct the branch line referred to, or has the time expired within which such branch line might be constructed?\n\"II. Do such legislation, schedules and charter authorize construction by the said company of the proposed branch line, it being altogether situated in the Province of Ontario?\n\"III. Is it open to the James Bay Railway Company or to the Board of Railway Commissioners to take the objection that the time within which the said company may build branch lines under its charter has expired? \"8. All statutes and orders-in-council, also the said maps, plans, profiles and books of reference may be referred to on the argument of the case subject to all objections as to their admissibility in evidence.\n\"9. All the statements in the schedule hereto for the purpose of this reference are admitted by the parties to be correct and may be used on the argument subject to all objections as to their admissibility in evidence.\n\"SCHEDULE.\"\n\"REFERRED TO IN THE FOREGOING STATEMENT OF CASE.\"\n\"(1) At the date of the Canadian Pacific Railway Charter (1881) the territory through which its main line was to be constructed was, with the exceptions to be mentioned, almost completely uninhabited and Only by its general characteristics had become known to the people of Canada. The exceptions to this statement are:\u2014\n\"(a) A small settlement existed at Port Arthur and Fort William:\n\"(b) Southern portions of the Province of Manitoba and as far west at the present western boundary of the Province had been surveyed and were sparsely settled, particularly in the neighborhood of Rat Portage and the Red River District where the \"Winnipeg settlement was:\n\"(c) Some portions of the country between such western boundary and British Columbia had been surveyed into blocks of sixteen townships each:\n\"(d) A small settlement on the British Columbia coast.\n\"(2) From year to year after the date of the contract the Government of the Dominion of Canada caused portions of Manitoba and the Northwest Territories to be surveyed and set off into townships and sections but it was not until the year 1901 that the last of the townships in the North\/West Territories and western part of Manitoba through which the railway runs was surveyed and set off into sections. Some of the territory in the eastern part of Manitoba and the western part of Ontario, and in British Columbia, together with large tracts in Manitoba and the North-West Territories through which branch lines of the Canadian Pacific Railway may at some time run (if the contentions of the Canadian Pacific Railway in in question herein are sustained) have not yet been surveyed even into townships by the Government.\n\"(3) At the date of the Canadian Pacific Railway charter the main line of the railway north of Lake Superior had been projected to run some distance north of the Lake and join the line between the Lake and Selkirk. The accompanying sketch marked Plan No. 1, (partial copy of a map attached to the report of the then Engineer-in-Chief of the Department of Railways\u2014Mr. Sandford Fleming\u2014dated 26th April 1878), shows the projected junction of the eastern and Lake Superior sections of the railway and the line to Fort William as then contemplated. After that date the route of the main line was changed. The part of it lying north of Lake Superior was brought more to the south so as to skirt the Lake and the western end of the eastern section was made to join the eastern end of Lake Superior section at or near Fort William as shown in the accompanying sketch marked Plan No. 2 which is a partial copy of a map.\n\"(4) Prior to 1st May, 1891, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, without any other legislative authority than that contained in the legislation of the Parliament of Canada appearing in the said statute 44 Vict., ch. 1, and the schedules thereto and the charter issued in pursuance thereof, constructed and equipped the branch lines of railway or extensions of branches in List A, in paragraph 5. hereof. Subsequent to said first May, 1891, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company have constructed, without any such other authority, the branches or extensions of branches set out in List B in paragraph 5 hereof. In respect of the branches or extensions of branches set out in the said lists, those which are accompanied by the word \"(Inspected)\" were inspected by a Government Engineer and permission granted to the Company to open such branches respectively for the public conveyance of passengers.\n(5) For the information of the court the following lists have been prepared:\u2014\n\"LIST A\"\nBRANCHES OF THE COMPANY'S MAIN LINE CONSTRUCTED PRIOR TO MAY 1st, 1891.\"\n\"1.

The Company enacted bylaws in connection with the issue of the branch bonds, and, on 19th May, 1887, an order-in-council was passed approving of such by-laws.\nAs to the Dyment Branch, in Ontario, 63 & 64 Vict., ch. 8, authorized a cash subsidy. \"The subsidy has been paid by the Dominion Government to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. The subsidy agreement between the Crown and the company, dated 28th August, 1902, and signed on behalf of Her Majesty by the Acting Minister of Railways, contains the following recital:\u2014'Whereas the company was incorporated and authorized to build the railway hereinafter mentioned by the Act or Acts following, namely, Canada 1881,chapter 1, section 14' This section is the clause in the company's original charter authorizing the construction of branch lines.\" As to the Arrow Lake Branch, in British Columbia. 55 & 56 Vict., ch. 5, sec. 3, authorized a cash subsidy. \"The subsidy has been paid by the Dominion Government to the company.\"\nAs to the Pheasant Hills Branch, in Manitoba and North-West Territories, by 3 Edw.

The subsidy agreement is dated 14th January, 1904, and the recital contains a reference to the company's original charter similar to that in the Dyment Branch.\"\nAs to the Souris Branch, in Manitoba and North-West Territories, by 53 Vict, ch. 4, sec. 1, \"the Governor-in-Council may grant subsidies in land hereinafter mentioned to the railway companies and towards the construction of the railways also hereinafter mentioned, that is to say:\u2014To the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, Dominion lands to an extent not exceeding six thousand four hundred acres per mile for a branch line to be constructed from Glenboro' westerly a distance of about sixty miles, to a point on the proposed branch railway of the said company running from Brandon, south-westerly.\u2014To the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, Dominion lands to an extent not exceeding six thousand four hundred acres per mile for a branch line of railway from a point at or near Brandon, on the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, south-westerly to or near township three, range twenty-seven, west of the first principal meridian, and thence westerly a total distance of one hundred miles; and also a similar grant, at the same rate per mile, for the said company's proposed branch railway from a point on the line just described at or near township three, range twenty-seven, west of the first principal meridian, easterly to Deloraine, a distance of about twenty-five miles,\u2014making the total length of railway to which this grant is applicable one hundred and twenty-five miles.\"\n\"The order-in-council of 18th of May, 1899, providing for this grant of land states that: 'It is the intention of the company to build these extensions under the powers conferred upon It in relation to the building of branch lines.' The order-in-council of 7th February, 1891, sets apart the reservation of land required to meet the above grant. Orders-in-council were made in 1890 and in 1891 (after 1st May) extending the time for completing this branch. The order-in-council of 24th August, 1894, provides for a land grant of 6,400 acres per mile, for the extension of the Souris Branch from a point in the vicinity of Souris in a westerly direction, a distance of about 32 miles. The order-in-council of 22nd August, reports that the company has earned 1,408,704 acres of land by the construction of the Souris Branch and provides for grants thereof; 54 & 55 Vict., ch. 10 authorizes the Governor in Council to grant the land subsidies for another branch in Manitoba; 54 and 55 Vict., ch. 71, \"authorizes the issue of Consolidated Debenture Stock to use in acquiring or satisfying bonds issued in respect of the Souris Branch and contains the following words in sub-section (a) of section 1; The company being at the time of the passing of this Act empowered by its charter to construct the same.' All this stock has been issued and sold by the company and is now outstanding.\"\nThe statement continues:\u2014\n\"The only reference in the statutes to the Sudbury Line is contained in 51 Vict. ch. 51 (1888), which is the Act increasing the company's bonding powers on branch lines from $20,000 to $30,000 a mile. The preamble to this Act is as follows:\u2014\"Whereas the Canadian Pacific Railway Company has, by its petition, represented that the branch line, to be known as the Toronto Branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which it proposes to construct under its charter from a point at or near Sudbury to a point at or near Claremont, will be unusually expensive; that an issue of twenty thousand dollars of bonds per mile thereon would not constitute a sufficient aid towards the construction thereof; and that a similar state of things will probably occur in respect of other branches to be hereafter built by the said company, and it has prayed that the maximum amount of bonds to be issued on any such branch, be fixed at thirty thousand dollars per mile, and it be authorized to issue debenture stock in the place and stead of such bonds; and it is expedient to grant the prayer of the said petition.\n\"8. The route map of the James Bay Railway Company was duly filed and approved by the Minister of Railways and Canals pursuant to section 122 of the 'Railway Act 1903' on the 2nd day of April 1904. Plans, profiles and books of reference showing the James Bay Railway Company's location through the districts of Nipissing, Parry Sound and Muskoka and the County of York were duly submitted to and sanctioned by the Minister of Railways and Canals prior to the coming in force of the said Act and thereafter by the Board of Railway Commissioners at various dates between January 26th, 1904, and December 14th 1904, and all requirements of the several Railway Acts applicable thereto preliminary to the commencement of construction have been duly complied with.\n\"9. The locations of the two railways in the District of Nipissing for some distance occupy identical areas and at other places throughout the locations they overlap and cross each other. By the deviations of the Canadian Pacific Railway in question herein that company is seeking to occupy a line which will cross the line of the James Bay Railway Company.\n\"10. At the dates of the passing of the Act 44 Vict. ch. 1, the entering into the agreement and the granting of the charter referred to in the said Act, the North-West Territories were governed by the Parliament of Canada by virtue of The Imperial Act 34 & 35 Vict. ch. 28, sec. 4.\"\n\"11. On or about the 13th day of November, 1897, at the request of the then Minister of the Interior, Sir Oliver Mowat, then Minister of Justice, after hearing counsel for those interested including the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, gave a written opinion which deals with the power of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to build branches under the statute 44 Vict. ch. 1. The following is the whole of such opinion in so far as it relates to the power of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to build branches.\"\n\"I think, though the point is not free from difficulty, that the time for building branch lines was limited to the time mentioned in clause 4 of the contract. That clause stipulates for the completion, on or before the 1st May, 1891, of the works therein described as the east section and centre sections of the road and the 15th section of the Act provides for the company's constructing \"the main line,\" and an existing branch described in the Act, and also other branches to be located by the company from time to time as provided by the said contract * * * 'the said main line of railways and the said branch lines of railway shall be commenced and completed as provided by the said, contract.' This language is so clear and explicit that it is out of the question to suppose it not to have been intended that there should be a limit of time as regards the branches. Not only does the Act expressly state the contrary, but to give an unlimited time for commencing or completing a railway authorized by any Act would have been contrary to the whole course of railway legislation. It would be contrary also to the policy of the General Railway Act of 1879 s. (6) which Act is referred to in the 22nd clause of the contract as applying to the Canadian Pacific Railway so far as applicable thereto and as not inconsistent with the Act relating to that company.\n\"Now it is true that the 4th section of the contract does not expressly mention branch lines. But it being quite clear from the 15th section of the Act that it was intended there should be a limit of time both for commencing and for completing these, that Parliament interpreted some provision in the contract as containing a limit or as showing a limit when read with the 15th section of the Act, and that the only provision on the subject of such a limit is the 4th clause of the contract, that clause is to be construed accordingly. The words 'the said main line of railway and the said branch lines of railway shall be commenced and completed as provided by the said contract' may be read as including in the eastern and centre sections named the branch lines which the company should build therefrom under the authority of the Act; or the 15th section may be read as if it said \"provided for by the contract in respect of the works therein specified. It was evidently intended by Parliament to put the main line and the branch lines on the same footing in this respect.\n\"It has been suggested that the 15th section may be read as limiting time for those branch lines only which the company had contracted to build, but these are no more provided for by the words than other branch lines are; and if the 4th clause may in the light of the 15 th section be read so as to embrace the branch lines contracted for, these may be read in like manner as embracing the branch lines located by the company from time to time.\"\nThe date fixed by the contracts referred to in section six of the agreement in the schedule to 44 Vict. ch. 1 for the completion of the construction of the Lake Superior section, were all prior in time to the first of May, 1891.\nThe statement then refers, with extracts to the following statutes namely,\u201433 & 34 Vict. ch. 3 (D), (preamble and sec. 1); 34 & 35 Vict. ch. 28 Insp.

Blake K. C., Walter Cassels K. C. and W. A. H. Kerr for the James Bay Railway Co. In order to arrive at the rights of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. in view of the legislation which has been enacted, it becomes essential to consider what rights were granted to the contractors by section 14 of Vict., ch. 1. The company stand in the place of the contractors, they are the contractors, and their right to construct branch lines is a right given them \"from time to time.\" It must be limited to the time within which their contract had to be performed. No right could exist after they had received the consideration for the fulfilment of their contract, within the time limited, after the expiration of their contract and after the time had expired.\nNo such right can be inferred from the provisions of section 15 of the charter. The opinion of Sir Oliver Mowat, on this question,[24] is obviously correct and we refer to it as part of our argument). It is obvious that if the general powers to build branches, as claimed, existed there could be no necessity for the specific powers given as to building branches mentioned in clause 15 of the charter.\nIt was never contemplated or intended that the Dominion should infringe the rights of the provinces to incorporate railways having their terminal points within the provincial boundaries, in virtue of the British North America Acts, 1867 and 1871. At the time of the contract the powers subsequently taken by the Dominion, by 46 Vict, ch. 24, sec. 6, as to legislation in regard to railways intersecting or crossing railways chartered by the Dominion, did not exist nor was any such right then claimed by the Dominion. The \"territory\" within which the Tights were granted respecting branch lines was, obviously, only that territory over which the Dominion had sole jurisdiction under the British North America Act, 1871. It is impossible to place any construction upon clause 14 of the contract which might extend its meaning so as to include other parts of Canada.\nThe only other clause which can be relied upon by the company as giving them the powers claimed as to the construction of branch lines is clause 15 of the charter, and this still leaves them subject to the condition that any branches or branch lines, including those specifically named, must be completed within the time limited for the construction of the main line according to the contract. If there was such power conferred as is now claimed by the company as to the construction of branch lines, then there would have been no necessity of giving specific powers as to the branches particularly mentioned. These particular branches were named and power given to construct them for the reason that they would not be covered by section 14 of the contract, their terminal point not being within the territory of the Dominion. It is obvious that, when the contract was entered into, the contractors were to have the right to layout and equip, etc., branch lines to any point or points within the territory of the Dominion, what was meant by the word \"territory\" was what was known by the British North America Act of 1871, as the territory of the Dominion. It would seem an absurd contention that these words should be construed as meaning any point or points within the Dominion of Canada.\nThe contractors were constructing two sections; qu\u00fb contractors they would have the right to build branch lines. The Government were constructing the other sections of the railway, and the words \"to any point or points within the territory of the Dominion\" cannot be held to mean more than they say, and have reference only to as the territory over which the Dominion had exclusive legislative jurisdiction, and in which the Dominion owned the Crown lands. This is manifest from the provision of the clause 14, providing that the Government shall grant to the company the lands required for the roadbed of such branches, for the stations, etc., in so far as such lands are vested in the Government. How can it reasonably be contended, having regard to this language, that a general power to construct east from Winnipeg to the Atlantic Ocean, or west from Winnipeg to the Pacific Ocean, could be conferred upon these contractors?\nWe also submit that if, in point of fact, any particular branches have been sanctioned by the Parliament of Canada, although we do not admit that any have been so sanctioned, such a thing as estoppel could only be set up in regard to the particular branches so sanctioned. There is no ambiguity whatever as to the meaning of the statute, 44 Vict., ch. 1. There is no power in the Government to vary or alter the terms of the contract and such a thing as an estoppel against the Crown and the public of Canada, by an acceptance of certain lines constructed even if beyond the powers of the company, could have no possible effect in enlarging the powers conferred by the statute and contract hereinbefore set out.\nAs to our rights of contestation, we do not require to bring in the Attorney General for Ontario; we can sustain our position alone as our lands and rights are imperilled. Grahame v. Swan[25], at page 559. As to the interpretation of the words \"time to time\" see 26 Am. & Eng. Encycl (2 ed.), and at page 167 as to stare decisis being a wider term than res judicata. This is not a case for scire facias, there is no question of a forfeiture of any kind.\nNew combe K.C., Deputy of the Minister of Justice, and A. S. White K.C. held a watching brief on behalf of the Attorney General for Canada.\nFormal answers were rendered by the Supreme Court of Canada, as follows:\u2014\n\"In the matter of application No. 590 of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for approval of certain deviations from the original plan of the route of the Sudbury Branch of their railway, referred by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada, under the statute of Edward VII., chapter 58, section 45, being 'The Railway Act, 1903,' the following questions were submitted to the court for hearing and consideration:\n\"I. Has the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, under the legislation, schedule and charter aforesaid, now power to construct the branch line referred to, or has the time expired within which such branch line might be constructed? \"II.

Sedgewick J.\"\n\"D. Girouard J.\"\n\"L. H. Davies J.\n\"Wallace Nesbitt J.\"\n\"John Idington J.\" Reasons for foregoing answers were delivered by Their Lordships, annexed to the formal opinion, as follows:\u2014\nSedgewick J.\u2014This is a reference to this court from the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada by virtue of the Dominion Railway Act, 1903 Some years ago the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. had located a branch line from Sudbury in the Province of Ontario to Toronto, and had obtained, before the passing of the Railway Act of 1893, the approval of the Minister of Railways to the location and plans thereof. Subsequently, after the passing of that Act, the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. applied to the Board for approval of certain deviations from the proposed route of this Sudbury branch. The James Bay Railway Co. opposed the application on the ground that the Canadian Pacific Railway Co had no authority to construct the branch cither under its original charter or by any subsequent legislation. These are the questions:\n1. Has the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, under the legislation, schedules and charter aforesaid now power to construct the branch line referred to; or has the time expired within which such branch line might be constructed?\n2. Do such legislation, schedules and charter authorize construction by the said Company of the proposed branch line, it being altogether situated in the Province of Ontario?\n3. Is it open to the James Bay Railway Company, or to the Board of Railway Commissioners, to take the objection that the time within which the said Company may build branch lines under its charter has expired?\nSection 15 of the Canadian Pacific Railway Go's charter is as follows:\n15. The Company may lay out, construct, acquire, equip, maintain and work a continuous line of railway, of the gauge of four feet eight and one-half inches, which railway shall extend from the terminus of the Canada Central Railway near Lake Nipissing, known as Callander Station, to Port Moody in the Province of British Columbia; and also, a branch line of railway from some point on the main line of railway to Fort William on Thunder Bay; and also the existing branch line of railway from Selkirk, in the Province of Manitoba, to Pembina in the said Province; and also other branches to be located by the Company from time to time as provided by the said contract,\u2014the said branches to be of the gauge aforesaid; and the said main line of railway, and the said branch lines of railway, shall be commenced and completed as provided by the said contract; and together with such other branch lines as shall be hereafter constructed by the said company, and any extension of the said main line of railway that shall hereafter be constructed or acquired by the company, shall constitute the line of railway hereinafter called The Canadian Pacific Railway.\nThis section contemplates two classes of branch lines, namely, branches such as that from Selkirk to Pembina, and another from a point on the main line of railway to Fort William. These two branches may be called the Government branches to distinguish them from the other branches to be located by the company from time to time, which may be called the company branches.\nI take the meaning of this clause to be that the company might \"acquire\" (it certainly was not intended that they should \"lay out\" or \"construct\") the two sections of the main line which the Government were to build and those Government branches which were either in process or in contemplation of being built; and that they might \"construct\" the other two sections of the main line and other branches \"to be located by the company from time to time.\"\nThe first question then is: Has the time expired for the construction of branch lines? The controlling word is in clause 15 above set out, wherein it is provided that the company may construct other branches to be located by the company from time to time, and that the whole, namely, the said main line of railway and the said branch lines of railway (Government branch lines and company branch lines) shall be commenced and completed as provided by the said contract. There is a time specified when the main line is to be commenced and also when it is to be completed, but there is no provision in the contract which can with any certainty lead to the conclusion that any time was ever fixed for the commencement or completion of the company's branch lines. The contestants, the James Bay Railway Co., seek to eliminate the words \"shall be commenced and completed as provided by the said contract,\" and to insert in lieu thereof words which may have, and which I think have as a matter of fact, a different meaning: They propose to read the provision that branch lines must be commenced and completed as provided by the said contract, as if it said that branch lines \"shall be commenced and completed within the same time as is provided by the contract for the commencement and completion of the two sections of the main line by the company.\" I have not sufficient boldness to venture upon such judicial legislation as this. Judicial legislation may be necessary where we have to delve into the common law to obtain some precedent for a state of affairs involving legal rights the like of which is new in the experience of mankind, but I have never yet been able to see any necessity for a resort to that method when we are endeavouring to interpret a written instrument, whether it be a statute, a contract, or any other document. No matter what the intention may have been, unless that intention can be unequivocally drawn from the language which the parties have used in the instrument under consideration, it is all the same as if there had been no intention at all.\nThe contestants contend that the contract must be construed so as to make the commencement of the branch lines co-incident with those of the two sections of the main line, but one section of the main line is to be commenced by the \"first July next\" and the other not later than the \"first May next.\" Which of these dates applies to branch lines?\nSeveral considerations in addition to those arising from a study of the mere words themselves will, I think, lead to the conclusion that it could not have been the intention of Parliament to provide a definite period beyond which the company would lose their power of building branch lines.\nConsider the condition of the North West Territories at the time this contract was made. A vast, practically unknown country, the fertile belt of which was in round numbers nearly 1000 miles in length, and nearly 500 miles in width. It was practically unsurveyed. The road was intended to be not only a great international highway extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific, but a great colonization railway as well, its main object being to open up to the world that magnificent area of wheat growing country, the wealth and potentialities of which we have even yet hardly begun to appreciate.\nThe Government had entered into an obligation with British Columbia pursuant to the \"Carnarvon Terms\" to complete the road at the earliest possible moment, and the whole power of Parliament, practically the whole revenues of the country, and every energy the Canadian people possessed, were cheerfully given to attain the end in view, the national honour of Canada being to a certain extent involved. The first great aim of the government, of Parliament and of the company must therefore have been to finish the main line first; branch lines to be built by the company might well afford to wait. They could not be built anyway for any practical purpose, particularly through the fertile belt so called, without previous survey and considerable settlement. What concession would it have been to give the company the right to build branch lines only during the ten years during which the main line was being built? They could not touch branch lines. It would be an illusory gift at the best. It has been suggested to us that the power contended for by the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. that, they have the right in perpetui y to build branch lines from their main line was such a tremendous power, a power so fraught with danger to the state and the exercise of which might prevent the building of other railways by competing companies, that any construction other than that must be resorted to. I have yet to see anything very extraordinary in the grant of this power, especially when we consider the other grants which Parliament in its wisdom was induced to make for the purpose of completing the railway and of thus cementing together the theretofore scattered fragments, the disjecta membra of the Dominion.\nParliament had contributed $25,000,000 in cash and 25 million acres of land. It had given gratuitously to the company the two main sections ready to be operated, at a cost I suppose as great as that of the sections built by the company. It had made them a perpetual corporation, and eliminated from the general Act section after section which might be supposed to interfere more or less with the carrying on of the enterprise and with the borrowing of money for that purpose. It had also, (and this may be deemed to be an extraordinary concession, necessary doubtless in the interests of the enterprise, but still extraordinary,) enacted that the Canadian Pacific Railway, and all stations, station grounds, work shops, buildings, yards and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances required and used for the construction and working thereof, and the capital stock of the company, should be forever free from taxation by the Dominion or by any province thereof to be established or by any municipal corporation therein, and it had as well exempted the company's lands from taxation for twenty years after the grant thereof from the Crown. Thus Parliament had given the company chartered powers to last forever. It had given them the right to operate forever a line of railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific, assuming the company took advantage as it has since done of this special provision in the charter for the acquirement of railways east of Sudbury. It had exempted the company's property, so far as it was within the North-West Territories and was used for railway purposes, from taxation forever. Why should it be thought a strange thing, an abnormal thing, a thing so unthinkable that the words of the contract must be twisted out of shape to obviate the difficulty\u2014 why should it be thought a strange thing that Parliament should give to the company along with these other perpetual rights, the perpetual right of building branch lines from any part of its main line to any other point within Canadian territory? The whole state of affairs at the time of the charter must have indicated that for many years, perhaps for generations, the Canadian Pacific Railway could be successfully operated only by the opening up of the North-West for settlement and by the building of branch lines by this parent road for the purpose of making the most of the country and developing its innumerable magnificent resources. One can easily imagine that it would have brought a smile to the cheek of those illustrious gentlemen whose daring and patriotism, and whose pluck and fortitude (along with that of others,) accomplished the work, had some law officer of the Crown in treaty with them suggested \"Oh, but if you want to build any branch lines you must begin and complete them at the same time as you begin and complete the main line.\" Short work, one can readily conceive, would be made of such a proposition as that.\nI take the liberty of adding here an epitome of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's argument on this branch of the case, as set out in their factum:\n1. The contract does not fix any date for completion of branch lines.\n2. The dates fixed for the commencement and completion of the main line cannot apply to the company's branches;\n(a.) Because there are several such dates, and there is no reason for selecting one rather than the other.\n(b.) Because the short periods for the commencement of the main line would be absurdly inadequate for the location of the necessary branches.\n(c.) And still more inadequate for the comencement of construction.\n(d.) Because the speedy construction of the main line was the paramount object of the contract.\n(e.) Because the main line itself (from which branches were to be built) was not itself fixed by the contract and was not definitely settled until the year 1882 or afterwards.\n(f.) Because the clause itself speaks of \"other branch lines\" to be \"hereafter constructed by the said company.\"\nI am now come to the second question: Has the Canadian Pacific Railway Company power to build branches in Ontario? The contestants say\u2014 \"No. That they cannot build branches except to a point within what is known as the North-West Territories,\" basing their argument upon section 14 of the contract which provides that:\nThe company shall have the right from time to time to lay out, construct, equip and maintain and work branch lines of railway from any point or points along their main line of railway, to any point or points within the territory of the Dominion.\nThey argued that the word \"territory\" there must mean immovable property owned by the Dominion. This argument appears to me to be so, shall I venture to say, far-fetched, that the very statement of it is its own contradiction.\nThey also argue that \"territory of the Dominion\" means \"The North-West Territories.\" A third argument is that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company is empowered to build branches from the eastern and central sections only. To my mind nothing can be more unlikely or inconceivable than this. Even admitting the contention, nothing can be derived from it, for the branch which is under consideration is admitted to commence at a point upon the eastern section.\nI simply propose to assert that the territory of the Dominion has no connection whatever with the phrase \"The North-West Territories of Canada,\" except in so far as the North-West Territories are part of that territory. The territory of the Dominion, I take it, is all those lands and lands covered with water which form part of or are under the Parliamentary control of the Dominion. The phrase has no reference whatever to the dominium or ownership of the Crown, but to those British Dominions beyond the seas, known under the constitutional Act by the name of Canada. The point, however, seems to me so insignificant that the elaborate argument given by counsel for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company is all that need be referred to.\nAs to the third question I concur in the judgment of my brother Nesbitt.\nGiROUARD J.\u2014This reference\u2014the first from the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada\u2014involves very important questions of construction of the powers of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., to construct branch lines. It has been said that franchises of this character are to be construed most strictly against the corporation and in favour of the public; but it is now well settled both in England and the United States that the powers may be implied as well as expressed, and that their construction must be reasonable, that is, consistent with and following a reasonable view of the general scope and purpose of the legislative grant, viewed in the light of surrounding circumstances. Attorney General v. Great Eastern Railway Co.[26]; The Government of Newfoundland v. Newfoundland Railway Co.[27]; Jacksonville Railway Company v. Hooper[28]. It will not, therefore, be out of place at the outset to give a short history of the Canadian Pacific Railway and inquire into the circumstances which gave rise to the construction and operation of this transcontinental line.\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway does not owe its existence to the ambition of individual adventurers, but to the national policy of Canada, as expressed in several Acts of its Parliament. The very preamble of the Act we are now requested to consider, 44 Vict. ch. 1, declares that by the terms and conditions of the admission of British Columbia into the Dominion of Canada\nthe Government of Canada has assumed the obligation of causing a railway to be constructed, connecting the seaboard of British Columbia with the Railway system of Canada.\nThe immense western country known as Rupert's Land, which had recently been acquired from the Hudson Bay Company, had not been surveyed; it was very little known and, as stated in the printed case, \"was almost completely uninhabited.\". The Canadian Government, however, was so satisfied that the obligation assumed in favour of British Columbia would easily be accomplished, that it agreed to do so within ten years from the date of the union, that is in 1881.\nThe stated case, settled by the Board of Railway Commissioners and agreed to by the parties, refers us to many statutes and other public documents. I think that in a case of public interest, I may say of Government or parliamentary contract or agreement like the present one, we ought to carefully consider not only the parts of the documents quoted, but also the whole, and in fact all the public documentary records which may affect the case, and which, under the Evidence Act of 1893, courts of justice can take official notice of without causing any surprise or injury to any party. In many past cases of this description this court and the Privy Council have even referred to opinions expressed in Parliament as reported in Hansard.\nIn 1872 the Parliament of Canada passed the first Canadian Pacific Railway Act and granted a subsidy of 50 million acres of land, and 30 million in cash; 35 Vict. ch. 71. Although two companies were incorporated to carry out the scheme, and one of them was accepted and obtained the contract, nothing came out of this first effort. In 1874 another offer was made, which will be found in 37 Vict. ch. 14. Briefly stated, it provided for a subsidy of 20,000 acres of land, and $10,000 cash per mile, and a Government guarantee of 4 per cent for twenty-five years upon such sum as might be necessary to secure the construction of the road. There was no provision for any branch line except the Georgian Bay and the Pembina branches, which were also generously subsidized. The second scheme also failed, and to keep faith with British Columbia an extension of time had to be demanded and the Government set to work by commencing to build two of the heaviest sections of the entire line, extending over about 644 miles of a mountainous country, namely, the Lake Superior section, from the head of Lake Superior near Fort William to Selkirk, and the western section from Kamloops to Port Moody. While these extensive works were in progress under Government contracts a new project was proposed, and approved of by Parliament, the meaning of which we are called upon to determine, as to branches to be constructed. This statute is 44 Vict. ch. 1, and was passed in 1881, although the contract which led to it was signed in October, 1880. The Government undertook to finish and deliver to the company the two sections commenced, and the company promised to build the eastern section from Callander Station to the Lake Superior section, and also the central section from Selkirk to Kamloops, on or before the first day of May, 1891, the company receiving a cash subsidy of 25 millions of dollars and a land subsidy of 25 millions of acres, valued at that time at about $1.50 per acre. This statute is composed of three parts. 1st. \"An Act respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway;\" 2nd. The said contract; and, 3rd. the charter or Act of incorporation. I presume the three documents must be read together, but if there is any discrepancy between them the contract must give way. I believe there is none, at least as to the point before us.\nAs it may easily be understood from the past experience most extensive and, in fact, unprecedented powers were demanded and obtained. To do so the whole policy of the country, as expressed in the Railway Act of 1879, had to be set aside and a new and exceptional one adopted. More liberal subsidies and concessions had to be granted. The two Government sections, which were estimated to cost about $28,000,000, but did actually cost a little over $31,000,000, were to be delivered free of charge. The lands required for the Toad bed, for stations, station grounds, workshops, dock ground and water frontage at the termini on navigable waters, buildings, yards, if vested in the Government, were granted to the company. It was also agreed that all this property and the railway, its rolling stock and the capital stock of the company were to be forever free from taxation by the Dominion or the Territories, or any province or any municipal corporation to be established therein, and that the land grants were also to be free from taxation for 20 years from the date of the Crown patent, unless sooner sold or occupied. The selection of these lands was entirely left with the company instead of the Government. The importation of the rails and all railway and telegraph material to be used in the original construction was declared to be free from customs duty. The company might at any time, whether within ten years or after, operate lines of steamers over seas, lakes and rivers, which it might reach or connect with, although in doing so it might damage or even destroy similar lines already existing. Finally, to come to the matter which is the subject of this reference, unlimited powers to build branch lines were given to the railway company by merely depositing the plan of location, without the sanction of the Governor in Council.\nNotwithstanding these extraordinary concessions and privileges, the company soon almost came to grief, and in 1884 had to come to Parliament for relief. It was granted in the form of a temporary loan for nearly $30,000,000, which was satisfied and settled a few years afterwards, and before maturity, partly in cash or its equivalent, and partly by selling to the Government 6,793,014 acres of its land grants at $1.50 an acre. (47 Vict. ch. 1., 49 Vict. ch. 9.) Ever since the company's success has been constant and on the increase, so much so that it has added 4,785 miles of extensions and branches to its original main line, and has finally become one of the greatest railway corporations in the world, with a paid-up capital of $407,000,000, and nearly $133,000,000 of bonded debt, according to the blue books published by the Government, from which and the Acts of Parliament all the above figures have been collected. Now railway charter holders who are always to be found in every progressive and prosperous country, are quarrelling with it over the power, which it has at all times exercised, of building branch lines any where within the Dominion under their charter and without a special Act of Parliament.\nAt the argument I was very much impressed with the magnitude of the powers claimed by the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., as it would strike the mind under existing circumstances, but viewed in the light of the above circumstances it is not extraordinary. Parliament and the country, it seems to me \u2014 for its action was sanctioned by the people the following year \u2014 were prepared to grant almost anything to meet its obligation to British Columbia. But let us go now to the pure legal aspect of the case.\nThe charter, clause 15, enacts:\nThe company may lay out, construct, acquire, equip, maintain and work a continuous line of railway, of the gauge of four feet eight and one-half inches, which railway shall extend from the terminus of the Canada Central Railway, near Lake Nipissing, known as Callander Station, to Port Moody, in the Province of British Columbia; and also a branch line of railway from some point on the mainline of railway to Fort William, on Thunder Bay; and also the existing branch line of railway from Selkirk, in the Province of Manitoba, to Pembina, in the said province; and also other branches to be located by the company from time to time, as provided by the said contract \u2013 the said branches to be of the gauge aforesaid; and the said, main line of railway, and the said branch lines, shall be commenced and completed as provided by the said contract; and, together with such other branch lines as shall be hereafter constructed by the said company, and any extension of the said main line of railway that shall hereafter be constructed or acquired by the company, shall constitute the line of railway hereinafter called the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nClause 18 of the charter, para, (d), enacts that\nthe map or plan or book of reference of any part of the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway made and deposited in accordance with this section, after approval by the Governor in Council, and of any branch of such railway hereafter to be located by the said company, in respect of which the approval of the Governor shall not be necessary, shall avail, etc. Clause 31 of the charter also provides for the issue of bonds in place of land grant bonds\non the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway and the branches thereof hereinbefore described, but exclusive of such other branches thereof, etc.\nClause 14 of the contract reads as follows \u2014\n14. The company shall have the right, from time to time, to lay out, construct, equip, maintain and work branch lines of railway from any point or points along their main line of railway to any point or points within the tevritory of the Dominion. Provided always, that before commencing any branch, they shall first deposit a map and plan of such branch in the Department of Railways. And the Government shall grant to the company the lands required for the road bed of such branches, and for the stations, station grounds, buildings, workshops, yards and other appurtenances requisite for the efficient construction and working of such branches, in so far as such lands are vested in the Government.\nI was first inclined to think that the power to build the branch lines was limited to the North-West Territories, which were the property of the Dominion. After carefully examining all the clauses of the contract I soon became convinced that the word \"territory\" (without a capital T) in section 14 must be taken in, its ordinary sense, that is, jurisdiction. Whenever Parliament intends to use it as indicating the country known as the \"Territories,\" it generally uses that expression, or sometimes that of \"Territory,\" as in section 9 of the charter and the preamble of the Act, or more often that of \"North-West Territories,\" as in sections, 11, 14, 15 and 16 of the contract. Such is, moreover, the name which Parliament had previously given to that country. 32 & 33 Vict. ch. 3, s. 1.\nLikewise, as to time, I fail to find any limitation. It is contended that branch lines, like the main line, must \"be commenced and completed as provided by the said contract.\" But the contract does not impose any limitation as to the commencement or completion of their location or construction; it has a limitation in clause 4 as to the main line only and also \"the said branch lines of railway\" contracted for, namely, the Fort William branch\u2014which was never built in consequence of a deviation of the main line \u2014 and the Pembina branch, which, although finished, had to be maintained and worked. As to the other branches to be located, which the company may or may not immediately construct, the charter, section 15, and the contract, clause 14, both provide that they may be constructed from time to time, that is, at any time the company deems it expedient. This is the only reasonable construction which can be placed upon these enactments. It is, in fact, necessary to the working out of the land grant arrangement.\nIt is stipulated in the contract, section 11, that these land grants are to extend back 24 miles deep on each side of the main railway from Winnipeg to Jasper House; but if they are not fit for settlement the deficiency is to be made up in the fertile belt or elsewhere \"at the option of the company * * * extending back 24 miles deep on each side of any branch line or lines of railway to be located by the company.\" It would take years, certainly more than ten years, before the company might be called upon to make this option and select its land grants; in fact the parties have admitted in the stated case that it was not till 1901 that the last townships through which the mainline of the railway runs were surveyed and set off into sections. They also admit that large tracts of land through which branch lines of the company may run under the charter have not yet been surveyed into townships by the Government. There is no limitation of time as to the option or selection; it could not be commenced before some years, and certainly could not be completed before the necessary surveys were made; parties agree that it cannot be completed even at the present time. How can it be contended that the company could possibly locate or build branch lines necessary to the development of these lands before they are selected and probably patented by the Crown?\nClause 6 of the contract provides for the completion and delivery of the Government sections partly by the 30th of June, 1885, and the whole at the latest by the 1st of May, 1891. I cannot understand how the company could possibly complete all its branch lines from these sections before the latter date, for, as I understand clause 7 of the contract and clause 15 of the charter, these sections form part of the Canadian Pacific Railway from which the company can construct branch lines as well as from the sections constructed by the company. As a matter of fact only seven branches were built prior to the 1st of May, 1891, in order to give railway facilities to distant settlements or to industrial establishments in close proximity, whereas nineteen have been built since that date. In all cases of railway development, especially in an immense and wild country like that traversed by the Canadian Pacific Railway, almost entirely uninhabited on its entire length of about 2,644 miles west of Callander Station, near Sudbury of to-day, the necessity of branch lines is not generally felt till the main line is built and operated, and for many years afterwards.\nIf any doubt be possible upon the point, which I do not, however, entertain, courts of justice should hesitate before denying a power which has often been recognized by the highest authorities. We have no expression of judicial opinion exactly in point except as to location, but we find, in the case of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Major [29] decided by this court in 1886, and reported in 13 Can. S. C. R., at page 237, dicta and propositions as to time, which seem to sustain the contention of the company in the present instance. Chief Justice Ritchie, referring to a certain limitation enacted by the Railway Act of 1879, and to section 14 of the contract, said, speaking for the court:\u2014\nFrom which (section 14) it is abundantly clear that the right conferred on the railway company from time to time to lay out, construct, equip, maintain and work branch lines of railway from any point or points along their main line of railway to any point or points within the territory of the Dominion is entirely inconsistent with any such limitation; and therefore I think the company had a right to construct a branch from any point or points on the railway to English Bay as well as to any other point or points within the territory of the Dominion.\nAnd further on the learned judge adds (at page 240):\u2014\nNo court has a right to reject, or refuse to give effect to, the words of the legislature if a reasonable construction can be placed on the language used, and, therefore, I am constrained so to construe this statute as to give effect, if possible, to this, to my mind, very plain language of the legislature, and I can give no effect to it if it was not the intention of the legislature to authorize such branches and such extensions of the main line as might be found expedient to complete and make available this great national undertaking, the construction of a railway connecting the sea-board of British Columbia with the railway system of Canada, a construction not only reasonable but one which, in my opinion, harmonizes with the subject of the enactment and the object which the legislature had in view.\nWhen the contract was under discussion in the House of Commons Mr. Blake, the leader of the Opposition, demanded its rejection upon the ground, among others, that\nby the contract, power is given to the company forever to build branch lines in various parts of the Dominion. (See Votes and Proceedings, (1881) p. 159).\nFrom the time of its approval by Parliament to the 1st of May, 1891, no less than seven branch lines were constructed within the limits of the old provinces, and after that date to the year 1903 eighteen more were built and operated within the old provinces, two of them extending through the Territories and only one being entirely in the latter country, the whole without any objection being raised by any one, and in almost every case, after due Dominion inspection and authorization.\nIn 1884 Parliament expressly recognized the Algoma branch, then in course of construction from Sudbury to Sault Ste. Marie, in the province of Ontario, under the general powers of the charter and authorized a large issue of bonds (47 Vict. ch. 1). Parliament has also granted cash and land subsidies to branch lines of the company constructed before and since 1891. A full list of all these branch lines is given in the stated case, and it is not necessary to repeat it here. I will, however, reproduce the preamble of a Canadian statute passed in 1888, 51 Vict. ch. 51, which is the Act increasing the company's bonding power on branch lines generally, and one of the Sudbury branches in particular, from $20,000 to $30,000 per mile, as expressing the views of Parliament both upon the location and time of their construction:\nWhereas, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company has, by its petition, represented that the branch line, to be known as the Toronto branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which it proposes to construct under its charter from a point at or near Sudbury to a point at or near Claremont, will be unusually expensive; that an issue of twenty thousand dollars of bonds per mile thereon would not constitute a sufficient aid towards the construction thereof; and that a similar state of things will probably occur in respect of other branches to be hereafter built by the said company, and it has prayed that the maximum amount of bonds to be issued on any such branch be fixed at thirty thousand dollars per mile, and that it be authorized to issue debenture stock in the place and stead of such bonds; and it is expedient to grant the prayer of the said petition, etc.\nIt may be said that implied recognition of power by the legislature is not sufficient to confer that power, although very high American authorities can be quoted to the contrary, which will be found collected in American and English Encyclopcedia, (2 ed.) vol. 7, p. 708; I refer especially to the case of Society vs Pawlet,[30] decided by the United States Supreme Court. But it cannot, I submit, be seriously contended that the subsequent action of Parliament is not sufficient to remove any possible doubt in the matter. And finally, when we consider the disastrous consequences which a decision adverse to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company would bring upon its millions of bonds and debenture stock distributed all over the world, which would not be binding upon the so-called branch lines, I think we should come to the conclusion that it has at least that effect, unless forced to do otherwise by clear terms of the statute. For the reasons already advanced I think the statute supports this conclusion. Without wishing to add anything to the judgment of the House of Lords in Attorney-General vs. Great Eastern Railway Co.[31] which I believe fully covers the case, I would be inclined, under the special circumstances of the case, to treat the charter of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in a liberal manner, like any other statute, in accordance with the principle laid down in the Interpretation Act, namely, that every Act of Parliament must receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best insure the attainment of the object of the Act, and of every provision or enactment thereof according to its true intent, meaning, and spirit; 31 Vict. ch. 1, s. 1, par. 39; R. S. C., ch. 1, s. 7, par. 56.\nWith these explanations, I shall now proceed to answer the questions submitted:\nTo the first question I answer;\u2014Yes, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company has now power to construct the branch line referred to, as under section 14 of the contract and section 15 of the charter it may construct any branch line at any time.\nTo the second question, answer;\u2014Yes. To the third question:\u2014In consequence of the above answers the answer to this question is unnecessary.\nDavies J\u2014After the fullest consideration and repeated conferences with my colleagues. I have reached the conclusion that the first two questions should be answered in the affirmative These answers render it unnecessary to give any answer to the third question, and I express no opinion with regard to it.\nI have read with great care the opinion prepared by Mr. Justice Nesbitt and, as I find myself in full accord alike with his reasoning and his conclusions with respect to these two main questions, I will content myself with concurring with his judgment so far as it relates to these two questions and their answers.\nNesbitt J.\u2014This is a case submitted by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada under the 43rd section of the Railway Act, 1903. The following are the questions submitted:\n1. Has the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, under the legislation, schedule and charter aforesaid, now power to construct the branch line referred to, or has the time expired within which such branch line might be constructed?\n2. Do such legislation, schedule and charter authorize construction by the said company of the proposed branch line, it being altogether situated in the Province of Ontario?\n3. Is it open to the James Bay Railway Company or to the Board of Railway Commissioners to take the objection that the time within which the said company may build branch lines under its charter has expired?\nIn the year 1874 an Act was passed, chapter 14 of 37 Victoria, intituled: \"An Act to provide for the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\" This Act recites the admission of British Columbia into the union with the Dominion of Canada. It recites the fact that by the terms of the admission the Government of the Dominion were io construct a railway from the Pacific to connect the seaboard of British Columbia with the railway system of Canada. It then provided that a railway to be called the Canadian Pacific Railway should be made from some point near to and south of Lake Nipissing to some point in British Columbia on the Pacific Ocean. It provided for the division of the said railway into four sections. It also provided for certain branches of the railway to be constructed, such branches to form part of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Section 8 of the said statute provided for the construction of the said railway in subsections by contractors, and, after providing for the construction and the consideration to be paid therefor, subsection 10 of the said section 8 provided that in applying the said Railway Act to the Canadian Pacific Railway or any portion thereof the expression '''the railway\" shall be construed as meaning any section or subsection of the said railway the construction of which has been undertaken by any contractors, and the expression \"the company\" shall mean the contractors for the same. The said statute sets out further provisions for the construction of the railway.\nSubsequent to this statute the Act in question (and upon which mainly this case turns) being chapter 1 of 44 Victoria, assented to on the 15th of February, 1881, was enacted. It recites that by the terms and conditions of the admission of British Columbia into union with the Dominion of Canada the Government of the Dominion has assumed the obligation of causing a railway to be constructed connecting the seaboard of British Columbia with the railway system of Canada. It also recites:\nThat whereas certain sections of the said railway have been constructed by the Government and others are in course of construction, but the greater portion of the main line thereof has not yet been commenced or placed under contract, and it is necessary for the development of the North-West Territory and for the preservation of the good faith of the Government in the performance of its obligations, that immediate steps should be taken to complete and operate the whole of the said railway.\nIt then recites:\nAnd whereas in conformity with the express desire of Parliament a contract has been entered into for the construction of the said portion of the main line of the said railway and for the permanent working of the whole line thereof, which contract with the schedule annexed has been laid before Parliament for its approval, and a copy thereof is appended hereto, and it is expedient to approve and ratify the said contract and to make provision for the carrying out of the same.\nThe statute then enacts under section 1 as follows:\nThe said contract, a copy of which with schedule annexed is appended hereto, is hereby approved and ratified, and the Government is hereby authorized to perform and carry out the conditions thereof, according to their purport.\nThe second section of the said statute provides that\nfor the purpose of incorporating the persons mentioned in the said contract and those who shall be associated with them in the undertaking, and of granting to them the powers necessary to enable them to carry out the said contract according to the terms thereof, the Government may grant to them, in conformity with the said contract, under the corporate name of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, a charter conferring upon them the franchises, privileges and powers embodied in the schedule to the said contract and to this Act appended, and such charter being published in the Canada Gazette with an Order in Council relating to it shall have force and effect as if it were an Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe contract by its first clause inter alia provided:\nThe individual parties hereto are hereinafter described as the company.\nI read this clause as a conveyancing description applicable to the contractors until after the necessary steps were taken by them to complete the incorporation authorized by the charter when the rights, franchises and privileges conferred by the contract on the incorporators became vested in the \"corporate entity\" to be known as the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. This was complete as I understand after the 9th April, 1881. See Gazette of that date.\nThe 13th clause provided that the company should have the right to lay out and locate the line of railway contracted for preserving the terminal points from Callander Station to the point of junction with the Lake Superior section and from Kamloops and from Selkirk to the junction with the western section. The work was divided into four sections and two branches, and the company were to build the central and Eastern sections which were to be commenced respectively by the 1st May and the 1st July, 1881, and to be completed by the 1st May, 1891. See fourth clause of contract. The Government, by the sixth clause of contract, were to complete the Western and Lake Superior sections by the latest by May, 1891. There were also two branch lines, one from Selkirk to Pembina and one from some point on main line to Fort William. These the Government were to construct the Fort William branch as part of the Lake Superior section, as a reference to the first clause of the contract and the map on page 16 of case will shew.\nBy the 14th clause of the contract it was provided:\nThe company shall have the right, from time to time, to lay out, construct, equip, maintain and work branch lines of railway from any point or points along their main line of railway, to any point or points within the territory of the Dominion. Provided always, that before commencing any branch they shall first deposit a map and plan of such branch in the Department of Railways. And the Government shall grant to the company the lands required for the road bed of such branches and for the stations, station grounds, buildings, workshops, yards and other appurtenances requisite for the efficient construction and working of such branches, in so far as such lands are vested in the Government.\nAnd by the 15th clause of the charter it was provided:\nThe company may lay out, construct, acquire, equip, maintain and work a continuous line of railway, of the gauge of four feet eight and one half inches; which railway shall extend from the terminus; of the Canada Central Railway near lake Nipissing, known as Callander Station, to Port Moody in the Province of British Columbia; and also a branch line of railway from some point on the main line of the railway to Fort William on Thunder Bay; and also the existing branch line of railway from Selkirk, in the Province of Manitoba, to Pembina in the said province; and also other branches to be located by the company from time to time as provided by the said contract,\u2014the said branches to be of the gauge aforesaid, and the said main line of railway, and the said branch lines of railway, shall be commenced and completed as provided by the said contract; and together with such other branch lines as shall be hereafter constructed by the said company, and any extension of the main line of railway that shall hereafter be constructed or acquired by the company, shall constitute the line of railway hereinafter called The Canadian Pacific Railway.\nIt is upon the construction of these two clauses that the contest mainly turns. Mr. Blake and Mr. Cassels for the James Bay Railway Company argued that the contract was one between the Government and the incorporators described as \"The Company\" and was only for the Eastern and Central sections and that the incorporators must complete building within ten years, and had only the right contemporaneously with their building of such sections to carry out and locate branches; that the \"corporate entity\" only became assignee of the privileges and franchises granted to the incorporators and could enjoy no higher rights than granted to the incorporators under the contract, and such rights were only, so far as we are here concerned, to locate branches up to May, 1891, and only from some point on the eastern and central sections to some point on land owned by the Dominion. I think this is a fair statement of the position taken by the counsel for the James Bay Railway Company. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company's counsel, Mr. Ewart and Mr. Aylesworth, contended that the \"corporate entity,\" the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, had the right for all time to lay out and locate branches from time to time from any point on the main line between Callander and the Pacific sea-board subject, at the present time, to the filing of plans and approval required by the Railway Act, 1903; that from Callander eastward the rights of the company were governed by section 25 of the charter with which we are not now concerned. A great deal was said in argument as to the previous railway policy of the Parliament of Canada and the policy since in respect to other railways, and as to the public danger involved if a construction such as contended for by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company was adopted. We are not in one sense concerned with that construction. The purpose is expressed by the terms of the statute which are absolutely controlling as to the legislative intent, and while a construction which will produce a consequence so directly opposite to the whole spirit of our legislation ought to be avoided, if it can be avoided without a total disregard of those rules by which courts of justice must be governed, yet if Parliament has explained its own meaning too unequivocally to be mistaken the courts must adopt that meaning. We have only to declare what the law is, not what it ought to be, and I feel relieved from any doubt in this case which I might entertain (though I entertain none whatever) by the fact to which I attach considerable importance that successive Acts of Parliament have been passed by which Parliament itself has assumed as the correct one the construction I adopt. (I shall refer to these later.) The courts too have expressly in one case and by implication in another adopted one phase, viz., the right to build anywhere from the main line from Callander to the Pacific. I will also refer later to these more at length. On the question of the construction contended for by the James Bay Railway Company being likely to place the territory tributary to the main line from Callander to the Pacific in the grasp of a monopoly I would only say that in practice no such result has followed. Numerous railway charters have been obtained and railways actually built in many places where, if my construction of the charter and contract is correct, the fear of the right of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to parallel, &c, would have deterred the application for the charter or the construction of the railway if capital was likely to be deterred by such fear. It is to be borne in mind also that in the United States, in most if not all of the states, the location of the line of its road is entrusted by law to the company alone, and that where a corporation has been organized in compliance with the conditions of the statute and has made a map and profile of the route intended to be adopted by the company, it has acquired a vested and exclusive right to build, construct and operate a road on the line which it has adopted subject to the right of other road companies to cross its route and lands in the way and manner provided by law. It would scarcely be urged that this policy, the very opposite to the one adopted here, has deterred railway building in the United States. It is to be further borne in mind that in this country all branches built by the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. to develop territory or to acquire traffic as the needs of the country arise, have to be approved as to the general route by the Minister of Railways and as to deviations, etc., by the Railway Committee and the public rights thus fully conserved; This of course has no bearing on the construction of the charter but is, I think, an answer to the argument of future monopoly which has been advanced as a reason for a different construction being the proper one to arrive at.\nThe general rule which is applicable to the construction of all other documents is equally applicable to statutes and the interpreter should so far put himself in the position of those whose words he is interpreting as to be able to see what those words related to. He may call to his aid all those external or historical facts which are necessary for this purpose and which led to the enactment and for those he may consult contemporary or other authentic works and writings. This however, does not justify a departure from the plain reasonable meaning of the language of the Act. The best and surest mode of expounding an instrument is by construing its language with reference to the time when and circumstances under which it was made, and next to such method of exposition is the rule that if an Act be fairly susceptible of the construction put upon it by usage, the courts will not disturb that construction. The authorities for these statements are too well known to render lengthy citation necessary. I refer, however, to Read v. The Bishop of Lincoln[32]; Herbert v. Purchas[33]; Maxwell on Statutes, (3 ed.) pp. 32-39, inclusively, pp. 423 and following; Broom's Legal Maxims (7 ed.) pp. 516-579. As to reference to House of Commons records for purposes of historical exposition, see The Attorney General of British Columbia v. The Attorney General of Canada[34]; The Fisheries Case[35]; pages 456-465 et seq.; In re Representation in the House of Commons[36], pages 497, 581-593. To apply, then, contemporaneous historical reference and. legislative and judicial exposition, the recital in the Act under consideration establishes that the Government of Canada was under obligation to construct a. railway connecting the sea-board of British Columbia with the railway system of Canada. The stated case contains the following admissions:\u2014\n(1) At the date of the Canadian Pacific Railway charter (1881) the territory through which its main line was to be constructed was, with the exceptions to be mentioned, almost completely uninhabited, and only by its general characteristics had become known to the people of Canada The exceptions to this statement are:\n(a) A small settlement existed at Port Arthur and Fort William; (b) Southern portions of the Province of Manitoba and as far west as the present western boundary of the province had been surveyed and were sparsely settled, particularly in the neighbourhood of Rat Portage and the Red River district, where the Winnipeg settlement was;\n(c) Some portions of the country between such western boundary and British Columbia had been surveyed into blocks of sixteen townships each;\n(d) A small settlement on the British Columbia coast.\n(2) From year to year after the date of the contract the Government of the Dominion of Canada caused portions of Manitoba and the North-west Territories to be surveyed and set off into townships and sections, but it was not until the year 1901 that the last of the townships in the North-West Territories and western part of Manitoba through which the railway runs was surveyed and set off into sections. Some of the territory in the eastern part of Manitoba and the western part of Ontario and in British Columbia, together with large tracts in Manitoba and the North-West Territories through which branch lines of the Canadian Pacific Railway may at some time run if the contentions of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in question herein are sustained, have not yet been surveyed, even into townships, by the Government.\n(3) At the date of the Canadian Pacific Railway charter the main line of the railway north of Lake Superior had been projected to run some distance north of the lake and join the line between the lake and Selkirk. The accompanying sketch marked plan No. 1 (partial copy of a map attached to the report of the then Engineer-in-chief of the Department of Railways\u2014Mr. Sandford Fleming\u2014dated 26th April, 1878) shows the projected junction of the eastern and Lake Superior sections of the railway and the line to Fort William as then contemplated. After that date the route of the main line was changed. The part of it lying north of Lake Superior was brought more to the south so as to skirt the lake, and the western end of the eastern section was made to join the eastern end of Lake Superior section at or near Fort William, as shown in the accompanying sketch marked plan No. 2, which is a partial copy of a map.\n(4) Prior to the 1st May, 1891, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, without any other legislative authority than that contained in the legistion of the Parliament of Canada appearing in the said statute 44 Vict. ch. 1, and the schedules thereto and the charter issued in pursuance thereof, constructed and equipped the branch lines of railway or extensions of branches in list A in paragraph 5 hereof. Subsequent to said 1st May, 1891, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company have constructed without any such other authority the branches or extensions of branches set out in list B in paragraph 5 hereof. In respect of the branches or extensions of branches set out in the said lists, those which are accompanied by the word \"inspected\" were inspected by a Government engineer and permission granted to the company to open such branches respectively for the public conveyance of passengers.

North-West Territories: The Portal Branch from North Portal to Pasqua, 160.3 miles. Constructed 1893.\nThe undertaking was of a very exceptional speculative character and in turning to the Act, contract and charter we find unprecedented clauses. The Government bound itself to complete two sections, the Fort William Branch and the Selkirk and Pembina Branch, and hand same over to the contractors, to pay a cash subsidy of twenty-five million dollars and to give a land grant of twenty-five million acres to be fit for settlement and to be in alternate sections; the land grant to be free from taxation for twenty years from the grant from the Crown; the capital stock of the company and its stations, station grounds, workshops, buildings, yards, rolling stock, etc., to be exempt from taxation forever. There are other marked benefits conferred, a masterly summation of which may be found in Hansard, 1881, vol. 5, p. 517. I refer to this latter only to show that the undertaking was thought to be so hazardous that exceptional privileges were deemed necessary to induce the contractors to enter upon the undertaking and to give point to the consideration that it was extremely unlikely any person contemplated that branches would be required prior to May 1891; that the road was a colonization road and branches would be built as the country developed and the future revealed along what lines trade developed making the location and construction of branch lines feasible and practicable. This being the situation of the parties the contract was made with the incorporators and a charter was granted creating the corporate entity which, after the incorporators had performed the initial requirements, came into existence on the 9th April, 1881. As I have before indicated, in my view after that date it was such corporate entity which is described by the word company when that word is used in the contract and charter. This is apparent when section after section is examined.\nSection 7. The railway constructed under the terms hereof shall be the property of the company.\n(This must mean the corporate entity not the incorporators who are also as I have said referred to as the company). The same section provides \"and the company shall thereafter and forever efficiently maintain, work and run the Canadian Pacific Hallway.\"\nSection 9 The Government agree to grant to the company a subsidy in money of twenty-five million dollars and in land of twenty-five million acres.\nSection 10 grants the road-bed to the \"company.\" Section 11 grants the land to the company, and further on the grant of land is to be\non each side of any branch line or lines of railway to be located by the company.\nSection 16 exempts forever from taxation the capital stock of the company and the lands of the company for twenty years from the Crown grant. As I have stated, according to Mr. Blake's argument, the word ''company\" meant incorporators, and the incorporators' obligations ceased in May, 1891, and the rights acquired by the contract by them were by the Act and charter at that date and then only vested in the corporate entity. In sections 17, 18 and 20 the word \"company\" is also used in a sense wholly inappropriate to the incorporators described as such as it would scarcely be argued that when the company may issue land grant bonds, etc., the incorporators as contractors were meant and not the corporate entity. If then the corporate entity is intended to be described when the word \"company\" is used in the contract when section 14 says The company shall have the right from time to time to lay out, construct, equip, maintain and work branch lines of railway from any point or points along their main line of railway to any point or points within the territory of the Dominion\na sensible construction can be placed on the language. If the argument is acceded to that the contractors (the incorporators) are thus described the result follows that as the gentlemen named were only to build and own the eastern and central sections \"their\" line of railway is only the eastern and central part of the railway, and branch lines can only be built from such sections. Mr. Blake and Mr. Cassels urged this most strenuously pointing to section 13 which says:\nThe Company shall have the right * * * to lay out and locate the line of railway hereby contracted for\nand as the only line contracted for was that part comprised in the eastern and central section, the language used in section 14 must be construed as I have indicated, and further that the words \"within the territory of the Dominion\" meant within land owned by the Dominion and not the area over which the Dominion Parliament exercised legislative jurisdiction. I may describe this as the argument of \"place\" as opposed to that of \"time\" with which I will deal later. To deal with \"place\" first. In my view the contract means that the company, the corporate entity at any rate up to May, 1891, could built branches anywhere from the main line of railway between Callander and the Pacific sea-board, and in using the words \"territory of the Dominion\" Parliament meant within the area over which the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada extended as to the whole main line of railway from Callander to the Pacific. If the construction argued for is to be placed on these sections it would lead to such obviously absurd results that' some other construction must be sought for. In pointing to these results 1 cannot do better than adopt some of the arguments of the counsel for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company upon this point:\u2014\n(1) A branch may commence at \"any point or points along their main line of railway \"\u2014anywhere in any province\u2014but it must end in the North-West Territory.\n(2) For example, a branch may (indisputably) commence at Portage la Prairie in Manitoba and run south-west; but it cannot stop until it gets beyond the boundary of the province. It must finish in the Territories.\n(3) Conversely a branch may (indisputably) commence at Regina in the North-West Territories and run north-east; but it must stop before crossing the Manitoba line. It must finish in the Territories.\n(4) What more absurd provision than that a branch line may start anywhere along a 2,500 mile line of railway, but must always run towards its centre, and must finish there within a fixed limit of a few hundred miles.\nObjection: Points \"within the territory of the Dominion\" means points upon land owned by the Dominion.\nPursuing the line or reasoning just submitted, it would appear that the effect given by the present objection to the clause under consideration is that although a branch may begin anywhere on the main line it must always finish upon Government property. It must not stop a mile short on Jones's land, or go a mile beyond to Smith's land. Some Government property must always be picked out for one of the termini.\nSo that if the Government did not happen to own a lot or two in a certain town, no branch could have its terminus there. And if in the town the Government did own a lot, the railway would have to lay the last rail upon it however inaccessible it might be\u2014or stay away altogether.\nAnd what if the Government sold the lot before the railway reached it?\nI would also add, I find in the contract the draftsman there describing the North-West Territories says:\nThe company may, with the consent of the Government, select in the North-West Territories any tract or tracts of land. (Contract, sec. 11).\nIn the establishment of any new province in the North-West Territories. (Contract, sec. 15).\nThe lands of the company in the North-West Territories shall be free from taxation. (Contract, sec. 16).\nMr. Cassels also argued that if the company already possessed the power 10 construct branches in Ontario, why was it necessary to get special provision inserted in clause 15 of the charter in reference to the branch line from Fort William to the main line? This branch was to be built by the Government and acquired by the company, so that argument fails.\nThese considerations would be sufficient in my view to determine that the argument as to the places from which branch lines would be built could not be limited as to point of commencement to the eastern and central sections and, as to terminals, to land owned by the Dominion. But, when one sees how the court and Parliament have dealt with the subject, it makes the conclusion to be now arrived at irresistible.\nThis court has already held in The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Major[37] that the company had power to build a branch from Port Moody to Vancouver, and this branch was on the western section and in the area of the Province of British Columbia, but within the legislative jurisdiction for the purposes of railway authorization of the Dominion Parliament. It is true the present argument was not advanced to the court but it must be assumed that the court would not overlook so obvious a want of legislative authority as is contended for here. In the case of Ontario etc. Railway Co. v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[38] the point urged as to the meaning of \"within the territory of the Dominion\" was, if correct, so complete an answer that one can scarcely understand if it was tenable if the court could say, at page 443,\nno question was raised as to the authority of the defendants (the Canadian Pacific Railway Co.) to construct a line of railway to the Sault Ste-Marie,\nand it is to be observed that the counsel now raising the question were engaged for the plaintiff in that case. For the action of Parliament, I refer also on this point to the list \"A\" before referred to, and to the list \"B,\" 8 to 16 inclusive, as to the points from or to which branches could be built, all of which acts are opposed to the construction contended for.\nI have therefore come to the conclusion I have above indicated that as to section 14, the line of railway referred to is the line from Callander to the Pacific seaboard, and that the words \"territory of the Dominion\" mean the area along such line or railway over which the Dominion Parliament had legislative jurisdiction.\nI come now to deal with the time within which the right to build branches so authorized must be exercised. The clause pointed to under which it is claimed no branch could be built after May, 1891, is 15 of the charter before set out. The clause used the words \"lay out, construct and acquire\" and these have to be divided and made applicable to the subject matter. The company was not to \"lay out or construct'' either of the branches nor two sections of the main line, but was to \"acquire\" these. That is the Government were under obligation to build two sections of the railway or two branches for the company and, as to these, the words \"lay out\" or \"construct\" are inapplicable to the company. There were other branches to be located from time to time by the company as provided by the contract. (Clause 14). When the draftsman says in clause 15 of the Act (schedule A),\nthe said main line of railway and the said branch lines of railway shall be commenced and completed as provided by the said contract\nI take it he is referring to the various sections and described branches for the completion of which an obligation existed both on the part of the Government and the company under the contract, and when he refers to other branches to be located from time to time he refers to the branches under clause 14 which the, company have the privilege of building but as to which no contractual or other obligation existed. No time was fixed by the contract either for the commencement or completion of such branches and it is a misdescription to refer to them as having a time limit under the contract. The express right to lay out, locate and build from time to time given by the contract cannot be cut down by mere surmise that a power to build from time to time could not be contemplated because it would be out of harmony with existing railway policy. The contract was very keenly debated; the effect of this provision was drawn in the most marked manner to the public attention and denounced as mischievous. See Hansard vol. 5, p. 503. I refer to this not as throwing any light upon the meaning of the clause but as shewing the attention of Parliament was drawn to the existence of such a clause and that it was open to the construction claimed for it. The clause was passed and the list I have referred to shews the branches built since 1891 and the action of Parliament thereon from that date until the present time.\nIn a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in 183 [Illegible Text], in a court in which both those great jurists Chief Justice Marshall and Justice Story sat, and the opinion of the court was delivered by Mr. Justice Story, it was held that the naming of a society in a royal charter was a plain recognition by the Crown of the existence of a corporation and of its capacity to take the land in controversy and further that such a recognition would confer the power to take the land even if it had not previously existed. See 4 Peters, 480, at p 502, where the argument of Mr. Daniel Webster is given effect to by the court. I cite this case not as an authority but as entitled to great weight on account of the eminence of the counsel and Bench concerned in it. It seems to me to be on the same principle as the cases referred to by me before collected in Maxwell on Statutes, (3 ed.) pp. 428=429, and as Parliament has over and over again recognized the right to build branches after 1891, that great importance is to be attached to such Parliamentary interpretation or recognition. It is to be borne in mind also that on the faith of the contract being ample authority to build at any time branches within the limits described, large sums of money it was stated had been borrowed solely on the security of such branch lines and Parliament must have known that such would have been the inevitable result. It is said that Sir Oliver Mowat, in 1897, when Minister of Justice, advised that no such power existed, but, it seems tome, that the fact of Parliament subsequently disregarding and ignoring his advice and again recognizing the right to build both as to time and place, strengthens the position of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in appealing to the doctrine of recognition embodied in the case in 4 Peters before referred to. It appears to me, therefore, that the time limit in clause 15 is only as to branches contracted for and has no application whatever to such branches as the company was privileged to build at its option. The third question it is perhaps unnecessary to answer in view of the opinion I have formed of the proper answers to the first two.\nAssuming that ten years was the limit within which branch lines were to be built, I am of opinion nevertheless that as there are no words in the Act, charter or contract expressly providing that at the end of the ten years all power to built shall cease such as were used in Montreal Park and Island Railway Co. v. The Chateauguay and Northern Railway Co.[39], that the power still exists until a forfeiture of such power is declared in properly constituted judicial proceedings. This is the rule in the United States. See Morawetz on Corporations, ss. 1006-1015; Thompson on Corporations, Vol. 5, ss. 6598-6602. In England I find no direct authority but if I am correct that the power still exists it would seem to follow that only in a suit to which the Attorney General is a party plaintiff (or if he refuses he may be made a party defendant) can the question be successfully raised. I do not decide this, however, as it is very doubtful where, as in this case, the James Bay Railway Company will be crossed and otherwise interfered with by the building of the branch and it has, therefore, a special and peculiar interest, whether it cannot raise the question. Hinckley v. Gildersleeve[40]; Town of Guelph v. Canada Co.[41]; Stockport District Waterworks Co. v. Mayor of Manchester[42]; Pudsey Goal Gas Co. v. Corporation of Bradford[43], would seem to indicate that in such case the James Bay Railway Company would be entitled to be heard in a suit brought by it to restrain the Canadian Pacific Railway Company entering upon its lands. In this proceeding, however, ss. 3 and 5 of the general Railway Act, 1903, should be read in with clause 14 of the contract and as additional to it, and as the Canadian Pacific Railway Company have to file plans and obtain approval of them, the James Bay Railway Company would have a right to appear and appeal to the discretion of the Minister of Board on such application. It is doubtful if the court could compel the Minister or the Board to act if in his or its bond fide discretion approval of plans was declined Attorney General v. Toronto Junction Recreation Club[44]; In re Massey Manufacturing Co.[45] shew when the court can interfere and compel executive action.\nI think the Minister or Board has more than ministerial powers and represent the Crown, and it seems to me that this distinguishes the case from a mere action by a private party when, even with his special interest, he might be precluded from raising the question as to which I do not think we are called upon to decide. I think, in this application to the special tribunal created by the Act, the James Bay Railway Co. may be heard.\nI would therefore answer to the first question:\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway has power to construct the branch referred to and the time within which such branch ought to be constructed has not expired.\nTo the second question; Yes.\nTo the third question; Yes\nIdington J.\u2014Under the Railway Act of 1903 the Board of Railway Commissioners submit for the opinion of this court the following questions:\n1. Has the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, under the legislation, schedules and charter aforesaid, now power to construct the branch line referred to. or has the time expired within which such branch line might be constructed? 2. Do such legislation, schedules and charter authorise construction by the said company of the proposed branch line, it being altogether situated in the Province of Ontario?\n3. Is it open to the James Bay Railway Company or to the Board of Railway Commissioners to take the objection that the time within which the said company may build branch lines under its charter has expired.\nThe legislation, schedules and charter aforesaid consist of 44 Vict. ch. 1, and the schedules annexed thereto, of which latter the first is a copy of the contract between Her Majesty and certain gentlemen who undertook thereby to build parts of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the second is a copy of the legislation that became the authority for the issue of the letters patent creating the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nIt is the extent of the corporate powers of this company as to building branch lines that is now called in question. The questions asked must be answered by the meaning given to sec. 14 of the contract schedule just referred to.\nTo interpret it properly regard must be had not only to the rest of the contract and the enactment that gives it vitality, but also to the history leading up to it and the conditions immediately surrounding it.\nWhilst all must be looked at and the whole considered together, we must bear in mind that the one schedule contains a temporary contract and the other the foundation for a chartered corporation that was to have a perpetual existence.\nThe contract was with certain parties who could not, save by the creation of the corporation, transfer their rights to any one else.\nThe corporation was to consist not only of such parties, but also of such others as they might associate with them as shareholders. The contract was only to be binding in the event of the Act of Incorporation being granted to the company in the form of schedule \"A.\" Section 21 of said contract that shews this, is as follows:\u2014\n21. The company to be incorporated, with sufficient powers to enable them to carry out the foregoing contract, and this contract shall only be binding in the event of an Act of incorporation being granted to the company in the form hereto appended as schedule \"A.\"\nThis legislation having been passed providing the Act of incorporation, the contract became thereupon immediately binding and the contractors then might or not as they saw fit seek for the immediate issue of the letters patent creating the corporation. They were not bound to do so. No part of this contract expressly rendered it necessary to do so.\n\"Whatever may have been the design of this cumbrous method and the hiatus that was to exist between the legislation providing for, and the incorporation of, the company, it is important to mark the existence of this hiatus for it enables one more clearly to observe by the actual segregation of the contract from the incorporation and incorporating enactments that there may, and perhaps must, be attached to each of the provisions of the contract a meaning quite independent of anything else in schedule A which might never have been called into active existence.\nI have no doubt that the parties who provided this condition of things had some real purpose in view and that it did not come about as mere accident.\nIts resultant effect on the meaning we must give to the provisions of the contract is not to be waived off by saying that the promoters, though contractors, never intended or were intended to construct the railway. Their legal position by virtue of this contract was that they must, and that there was no other means of escape from its obligations than by and through the creation of a corporate body which the contract did not render by its express terms at all obligatory on them to bring into being. Let us, therefore, interpret this contract as we can, and as far as we can, by itself as an independent document, but of course to be interpreted in light of what had gone before and the then surrounding conditions.\nThe first clause thereof interprets \"The Canadian Pacific Railway\" to mean the entire railway as described in 37 Vict. ch. 14, and the individual parties thereto as described by the words \"The Company.\"\nThe words \"The Company\" being a term that might appropriately be applied to the corporation to be formed, when formed may have been used in anticipation thereof and designed to bear a reference as occasion called for it to the syndicate body or the corporate body, but this possible double use or meaning in no way ought to be permitted to confuse us.\nThe primary meaning of the term \"The Company\" in this contract, and particularly in every place where present contractual obligation or present privilege or franchise is designed to be expressed, must mean the individuals as contractors.\nWhen those privileges and franchises have been transferred to and those obligations imposed on the corporate body by the occurrence of certain events, and the operation of the enactments that anticipated such events, and the Parliamentary assignment resultant therefrom has taken effect, the term \"The Company\" may be read then and thereafter in the same clauses or some of them as descriptive of or meaning the corporation.\nMeanwhile the term \"The Company\" designates contractors who have undertaken certain work. It means no one else.\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway which is in question in this contract and interpreted therein as I have pointed out by reference to 37 Vict. ch. 14, is by sec. 1 thereof defined as follows: 1. A railway, to be called \"The Canadian Pacific Railway,\" shall be made from some point near and south of Lake Nipissing to some point in British Columbia, on the Pacific Ocean, both the said points to be determined and the course and line of the said railway to be approved of by the Governor in Council.\n3. Branches of the said railway shall also be constructed as follows, that is to say:\nFirst. A branch from the point indicated as the proposed eastern terminus of the said railway to some point on the Georgian Bay, both the points to be determined by the Governor in Council.\nSecondly. A branch from the main line near Fort Garry, in the Province of Manitoba, to some point near Pembina, on the southern boundary thereof.\nAnd by sec. 4 thereof it is enacted that\nthe branch railways above mentioned shall, for all intents and purposes, be considered as forming part of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nThis railway was in process of construction by the Government when this contract was entered into.\nThe road to be built has been divided into four sections, of which the terminal points were in this contract more accurately defined than in 37 Vict. ch. 14. Two of these sections had been partially constructed and were by this contract allotted to the Government to complete, and the other two, called respectively the eastern and central sections, were by the contract assigned to the company for construction.\nThe Selkirk branch, from Selkirk to Pembina, was then completed. Sections 13 and 14 of the contract are as follows:\n13. The company shall have the right, subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, to lay out and locate the line of the railway hereby contracted for, as they may see fit, preserving the following terminal points, namely: from Callander station to the point of junction with the Lake Superior section; and from Selkirk to the junction with the western section at Kamloops by way of the Yellow Head Pass.\n14. The company shall have the right, from time to time, to lay out, construct, equip, maintain and work branch lines of railway from any point or points along their main line of railway to any point or points within the territory of the Dominion. Provided always, that before commencing any branch they shall first deposit a map and plan of such branch in the Department of Railways. And the Government shall grant to the company the lands required for the road bed of such branches, and for the stations, station grounds, buildings, workshops, yards and other appurtenances requisite for the efficient construction and working of such branches, in so far as such lands are vested in the Government.\nIt is this right from time to time to lay out, etc., branch lines of railway, etc., that is now said by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company here to continue for all time as theirs.\nThe question has been approached and argued as if the company had always existed, and as if it had been owner or in some way master of the main line from end to end of the original project, and as if the words \"their main line\" in sec. 14 meant the whole main line.\nHad that been the case, and the corporate company had an existence when this contract was entered into, one could understand the reason for asserting that the term \"their main line\" means what is now claimed by that company.\nNot only, as I have pointed out, is this not the case, but it was certain contractors only who were given the rights there and now in question. These contractors had by said sec. 13 only the right, subject to the approval of the: Governor in Council, to lay out and locate two sections of the main line, and the subsidies of $25,000,000 and 25,000,000 acres of land that they were to get by sec. 9 of the contract were mainly given for that work, and were to be paid and granted as the work of construction proceeded. The subsidies were by subsec. (a) of sec. 9 appropriated in relation to said central and eastern sections on the respective bases as to land and money as therein appears.\nWhat concerns us here is to observe that those subsidies were to be paid or granted as the work of construction of those two. sections progressed and became in twenty mile sections completed, so as to admit of the running of regular trains thereon. These subsidies would by this process be exhausted by the time of the completion of these two sections, which time was fixed at 1st May, 1891.\nIf we remember the limited authority given the company by sec. 13 and that their contract for construction had nothing to do with what was beyond their two sections, and that, though by sec 7 they became entitled to running rights over the other sections being constructed and to be constructed by the Government as same were completed, they were not to have any right of property therein until the eastern and central sections had been completed by them, and then only as Government had completed its parts, which need not be until 1st May, 1891, we will be able to understand the very peculiar words \"their wain line\" in this sec. 14. We see thus why what at first blush seems a strangely inapt expression is used. \"Their main line\" were the central and eastern sections built by them.\nIts true meaning being thus seized, it is plain that their rights to build branch lines were limited to that part of which they were in a limited sense masters. This also furnishes obvious common sense reasons for giving powers to build branches from their main line, when one reflects on the probable needs of construction and the anticipated colonization of the country that the contractors were becoming so deeply interested in.\nWithout giving to these words \"their main line\" a meaning that they will not bear in light of what I have adverted to or attributing to the man who drafted this contract a poverty of language or ignorance of its precise meaning that he nowhere else indicates as one of his failings, 1 think these words must be held to refer only to the two sections that were then, as they were constructed, to become the property of the company of contractors.\nWe find on turning to sec. 11 provision for selecting lands along and for 24 miles deep \"on each side of any branch line or lines of railway to be located by the company and to be shown on a map or plan to be deposited with the Minister of Railways.\"\nThis indicates nothing beyond a plain intimation that at least some branch lines of the nature indicated were expected to be built during and within the time when the company had to have their contract finished and be in a position to select their lands.\nIt is said, however, that all this does not, and that the contract does not, in express terms put a limit of time or place upon the expected construction of branch lines. I have indicated why I think the part or place was limited. If I am right in that limitation, I am unable to comprehend why it should exist in that limited way only unless we are to construe the grant of this power as one to be exercised only as incident to and during and not beyond the period fixed for the construction of those two sections in relation to which the parties were speaking and contracting, to be known as the eastern and central sections. \"Within such limits one could understand such a grant being made. Time and the existing condition of things would keep is exercise within reasonable bounds. If it were intended as a general power for all time I can see many more reasons for its creation or existence in relation to the other sections after construction than I can in relation to those to which my interpretation confines it.\nAnd why, if intended in the sense now contended for, should the extension of the then existing Selkirk and Pembina branch and branches from such an important branch have been omitted? We thus find the probable limitation of time, without imputing absurdity either in language, intention or construction.\nWithout formulating any rule or pushing any canon of construction too far for this complex matter of a grant, a contract and a Parliamentary concession rolled into one to bear, I think I am safe in saying that we need to seek for a reasonable meaning or intention and to avoid, if possible, that which would be repugnant to the then mode of thought and strangely inconsistent with the remainder of the contract.\nThat which I now suggest would not be unreasonable.\nWe find it by considering the contract as a whole, and the legislation before and with it, including Schedule A as a whole. We are forbidden by considering the Consolidated Railway Act of 1879, which was the deliverance of this same Parliament as to the general policy, of that time, in regard to railways and especially as to their branch lines, and the time within which main lines should be constructed, and in the application of that Act to the undertaking in question, to give this paragraph the meaning now contended for by the Canadian Pacific Rly. Co.\nThe lines upon which this contract was framed had been laid down by 37 Vict. ch. 14, in every essential feature.\nExcept in regard to the extent of the subsidies and the financial arrangements based thereon, speaking in a comprehensive and general sense, there was no material departure from those lines unless we are to interpret this contract as conferring upon the contractors the right (as now asserted) forever to build branch lines.\nWhy should we suppose such a radical change of purpose or of policy? Why when decided upon, if ever decided upon, should we find it conferred by a grant of a personal and non-assignable franchise and not expressly given to the perpetual corporation as such?\nI think we should be slow to attribute to Parliament an assignment forever of all right of control over the power of a railway company, building a line of such magnitude as this one, to build when, where and how it saw fit such branch lines as the company should decide to build. The aspect of national importance, from both the political and commercial points of view, seems also to forbid such a purpose, and especially such a sudden change of purpose.\nOf course, even if the purpose, so repugnant to all this, and the thought of that time, were yet plainly expressed we must give effect to it. It has not been so expressed unless we impute to the words \"from time to time\" as used here the meaning of \"forever.\" The contrary to my mind was intended, if not expressed in words, and the power of building branches was limited to those sections that the contractors undertook personally to build, and to the time of limitation for that building, and incidental thereto, as part of the whole, that whole being the completion and delivery over of the parts and branches so built to the future controlling power that from the 1st May, 1891, if not earlier, was to use the whole road.\nIt would seem from all this not only that the intention of the parties to the contract is discovered by reading it with regard to these limitations of time and space for the operation of the powers given by sec. 14 but also that full effect is given to the words \"from time to time\" when read to mean so long as the constructive period that these contractors might possibly have something to say in regard to the subject matter, and not to mean from time to time forever. A remarkable feature of this matter is that in so far as affecting the then present and soon or immediately to become operative contractual obligations, privileges or franchises this contract and the Parliamentary transfer thereof are implicitly relied upon to execute the purpose of the parties, but when it comes to the exercise of a right that would come into or might only come into being, or rather that the parties intended should have a right to exist and become at a later period a perpetual right, vested in the corporate company, the parties to this contract do not rely upon this contract, ample as are its powers, but in regard to its accruing future rights of paramount and permanent importance they are careful to repeat the provisions therefor in the legislation.\nSee for example the repetition in sec. 3 of the Act, of the contract conditions in regard to the perpetual and efficient operation of the railway and the money and land grants, and in sec. 5 of the Act of the future running rights over the road and ownership of same as completed, and of the whole when completed.\nThe deposit, the standard of construction, the times for completion, the grants of land for road bed &c, the extinction of Indian title, the restriction of competitive lines, some of the bonding provisions, and the right to build branch lines, are all treated alike as of a temporary character and permitted to rest upon the contract, also temporary, and are not repeated elsewhere. That which is not necessarily legislative in its character but merely contractual is governed by the contract. That which is to abide for all time is as one would expect treated as needing direct legislation.\nI recognize that this line of distinction is not adhered to in every respect and literally, but when we look at the contract and the legislation I think there exists a clear line of demarcation such as I have indicated between what was temporary in character and that which was to be permanent, and we find such an important matter as the construction of branch lines omitted entirely from the permanent side of the line of demarcation. Why should it from its importance and permanency not find its place there?\nAll the Syndicate had acquired by this contract was transferred by the operation of sees. 3 and 4 of schedule \"A,\" as soon as the letters patent were issued and the provisions of that schedule became operative, but that transfer did not enlarge the power to build branches beyond what had been possessed by the contractors. It transferred a right which at best could not have extended beyond the lives or surviving life of those to whom it was granted as a personal right, license, or franchise. I have to repeat that it could never extend by this contract to their assigns, for they were not named in the instrument framing the personal grant.\nThis being the only alternative limitation of the grant indicates again in another way the intention of the contracting parties that the right to build such branch lines should exist only in relation to and during the process of construction of what they had respectively undertaken should be done by each.\nNow, coming to the consideration of sec. 15 of schedule \"A,\" which is as it were a summing up of the whole matter, and seems conclusive upon close analysis thereof as binding us to adopt a temporary and not a perpetual time for the existence of the right to build those branch lines, sec. 15 is as follows:\u2014\n15. The company may lay out, construct, acquire, equip, maintain and work a continuous line of railway, of the gauge of four feet eight and one-half inches; which railway shall extend from the terminus of the Canada Central Railway near lake Nipissing, known as Callander Station, to Port Moody in the Province of British Columbia; and also a branch line of railway from some point on the main line of railway to Fort William on Thunder Bay; and also the existing branch line of railway from Selkirk, in the Province of Manitoba, to Pembina in the said province; and also other branches to be located by the company from time to time as provided by the said contract,\u2014the said branches to be of the gauge aforesaid; and the said main line of railway and the said branch lines of railway, shall be commenced and completed as provided by the said contract; and together with such other branch lines as shall be hereafter constructed by the said company, and any extension of the said main line of railway that shall hereafter be constructed or acquired by the company, shall constitute the line of railway hereinafter called The Canadian Pacific Railway.\nThis, analysed, provides as follows:\n(1.) \"A continuous line of railway\" &c.\n(2.) \"A branch line of railway from some point on the main line of railway to Fort William on Thunder Bay.\"\n(3.) The existing branch line of railway from Selkirk in the Province of Manitoba to Pembina in the said province.\n(4.) And also \"other branches to be located by the Company from time to time as provided bp the contract\"\n4a. \"The said branches to be of the gauge aforesaid.\"\n(5.) \"And the said main line of railway and the said branch lines of railway shall be commenced and completed as provided by the said contract.\n(6.) \"And together with such other branch lines as shall be hereafter constructed by the said Company, and any extensions, &c......... shall constitute the line of railway hereinafter called the Canadian Pacific.\"\nObserve that there are only two specific branches named, of which one is already existing and not needing \"to be located\" or built.\nWhen we ask the meaning of the 5th paragraph of this analysis we find the plural\u2014\"branch lines of railway\"\u2014used. It cannot, therefore, only refer to the specified branches preceding it, as there is only one \"to be commenced and completed.\" It must, therefore, of necessity include another or others. What other or others? Those that \"shall be commenced and completed as provided by the said contract, is the only possible reply, to begin with. And they can, in the next place, only be those (in the 4th paragraph of analysis) \"other branches to be located by the Company from time to time as provided by the contract\"\nWhether I have made my meaning clear or not, this seems to me as simple as the simplest mathematical problem. It is said, however, that though this be taken as the correct rendering of the language used, the words \"commenced and completed as provided by the said contract\", do not refer to branches, or at all events to those \"to be located\" branches. It cannot refer to any branches unless it be those branches to be located, for the contract does not name or refer by name to the branch here specified to Fort William at all.\nMoreover, the Fort William branch was not off or from the eastern or central section at all, and if what is now contended for by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company ever was supposed to have a foundation in fact, there was no necessity for referring in this incidental way to the Fort William branch. If the company had a right by the terms of the contract to build any branches they saw fit, there was no necessity for specially describing or apparently thus enabling them to build the Fort William branch.\nNo other branch is, or I submit can be, in question if those here referred to as \"to be located\" do not answer the description.\nAre we then, not being able to find something to which to apply those words (in paragraph 5 of this analysis) to read the paragraph as if the words \"and the said branch lines of railway\" had no existence or meaning? Is it to escape, as the only way of escape, from the imperative words \"shall be commenced and completed as provided by the said contract\" that we are to resort to that alternative?\nI think that they should be read in light of what I have adverted to as applicable to what may or shall have been done within sec. 14 of the contract, and that only. We thus, and only thus, can give effect in a reasonable and natural way to every word in this sec. 15.\nAnd when we have done so, we look back to the contract to find what is meant by these words completed as provided by the said contract,\" which plainly imply a period of completion.\nI think the 6th paragraph of this analysis relates to the branch lines which the Railway Act gives power to construct, and such other lines as might lawfully be constructed by or acquired by the corporate company.\nSuch anticipatory words are in such legislation useful and were appropriately used here.\nI am in this view not troubled about the Algoma branch legislation, the Sudbury branch legislation, or any other legislation relating to those branches built or partly built within the time limit I have suggested, nor am I in this result troubled about small branches within the powers given by the Railway Act of 1879.\nWhat is relied upon as happening since May, 1891, as confirmatory of the pretentions now put forward by the company, is for the most part thus disposed of and what remains is of an administrative character that ought not to influence any court in the interpretation of an Act of Parliament. I am unable to understand why some of these incidents have been allowed to trouble us at all. The branches running off the branch lines, as, for example, the Souris Branch, surely cannot help us to interpret the powers of the company in regard to branch lines running from a point on their main line.\nWhat was done in relation to these subsidiary branches illustrates when closely examined a variety of cases such as a parliamentary beginning within the time, a carelessness or audacity as to whether powers had or had not existed after the time expired, and finally a statute expressly granting the power by 63 & 64 Vict., ch. 55, to build just the same sort of branch lines if not the same as are here expressly put before us as exemplifying alleged parliamentary recognition, or extensions thereof.\nThe company petitioned Parliament for this grant of new powers, and in this same Act there is provided, expressly as it seems to me, that two lines off and from the main line shall be built by virtue of the powers therein given.\nIt looks very much as if in 1900 the company had abandoned, if indeed it ever seriously had before then put forward, the contention here in question.\nThe Arrow Lake branch is apparently part of the Kootenay railway scheme, for which there was independent legislation, and by 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 71, s. 2, as well as a preceding section, this company is empowered and protected\nThe Pheasant Hills Branch grant was to be commenced within two years from 1st August, 1903, completed before the end of four years from that date, or as fixed by the Governor in Council, and to be constructed according to the description, conditions, and specifications approved by the Governor in Council on report of the Minister of Railways and Canals, and specified in a contract with the Minister, who is empowered, with approval of the Governor in Council, to make it, and the location of the line is to be subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, and by sec. 6, the Governor in Council may at all times secure to other companies running powers and reasonable facilities for enjoying same equally, etc. And the Governor in Council is to have control over all tolls, etc.\nIndeed much time spent on this branch of the case following up the data given, so far as given, leads me to the conclusion that all the grants relied upon as some recognition of the existence of the powers now claimed were conditional upon terms to be imposed by the Governor in Council. And where the branch line involved a bonding power, as in the case of the Kootenay and other companies, no reliance was placed upon the powers now claimed and existing, but parliamentary sanction or confirmation was sought and got for what was to be done.\nI am quite aware that much of the reasoning I have adopted in reaching the conclusions I have is not in accord with that by which some of the former members of this Court arrived at their conclusions in the case of Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Major[46], which might have been supported on other grounds, and also does not necessarily govern us in this case.\nWith great respect and regard for those who decided that case, I take the liberty of thinking here that in some respects the arguments presented to us now were not presented then. It was admitted by counsel that if the time had elapsed within which the power to build branches was given, the question of the extent of that power need not be answered.\nI therefore confine myself on this point, without concealing my opinion, to saying in reply to question No. 1, that the time has expired within which such branch line might have been constructed. And as to the third question, I think in view of the great length of time that has elapsed, in my judgment, since any such power existed in the company and nothing as to the work in question here done under it, or asserting it, save filing of plans in question here, that it became the duty of the Board of Railway Commissioners to consider and determine the question of right, or extent of right, existing in the company when they applied to that Board and within their exercise of powers to determine, and that the Board could hear any one interested as the James Bay Railway Co. seemed to be here; and that Company as well as the Board had the right to take the objection taken.\nThis is a case of the limitation of the company's powers by time and space that were as I find defined.\nIt raises none of the questions that might have arisen in regard to work that had been only partly done when the time expired.\nSolicitor for the Canadian Pacific Railway Co.: A.

The solicitor registered the deed to himself but not the other, forging on the same a certificate of registry, and he, in 1895, mortgaged the land and the mortgage was duly registered. R.T. and W.T. were in possession of the land all the time from 1891; and only discovered the fraud practised against them in 1902. In 1903 the mortgagee brought action to enforce his mortgage.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (9 Ont. L.R. 105), Davies and Nesbitt JJ. dissenting, that the legal title being in the solicitor from the time of the execution of the deed to him the Statute of Limitations began to run against him then and the right of action against the parties in possession was barred in 1901.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nOn the 19th of June, 1891, the defendant Rachel Tranouth, then Rachel Maxfield, was the owner in fee simple and in possession of 100 acres of land in the Township of Cavan, and on that day, being about to marry her co-defendant, desired to convey to him an undivided one-half share thereof, so that they might become tenants in common in fee.\nShe therefore requested one George Sootheran, a conveyancer, to prepare the necessary instruments for that purpose, which he undertook to do.\nThe instruments which he prepared, and which were duly executed in duplicate, were a conveyance from the lady to himself, Sootheran, and a re-conveyance to the two defendants as tenants in common in fee.\nThe deeds were left with Sootheran for registration and safe keeping, and on the 29th of September afterwards, he duly registered the conveyance to himself, but fraudulently omitted to register the re-conveyance, and indorsed upon one of the parts a certificate of registration, to which he forged the signature of the registrar.\nAfterwards, on one or more occasions, Sootheran, without the knowledge of the defendants, fraudulently borrowed money for his own use, by mortgage of the land thus appearing to stand in his name in the registry office; and on the 30th day of August, 1895, he applied to Mr. Seth S. Smith, a solicitor, for another loan wherewith to pay off the mortgage or mortgages which he had previously made. Mr. Smith, acting for the plaintiffs, agreed to advance the money, $2,000, out of the funds of the plaintiffs in his hands upon receiving a certificate of the sufficiency of the security. For this purpose Sootheran forged a certificate purporting to be signed by the assessor of the township, expressing that the land was worth $4,000, and that the defendants were in possession thereof under a lease for seven years, of which only three years had expired. Upon the faith of this certificate the loan was completed upon a mortgage of the defendants\u2019 lands, dated the 30th day of August, 1895, executed by Sootheran to the plaintiffs, and which was duly registered on the following day.\nSome time in the year 1902 the defendants learned accidentally of the registration against their land of the mortgage or mortgages thus made by Sootheran, and began to make inquiries, upon hearing of which Sootheran absconded.\nThe present action was commenced on the 12th of May, 1903, against the defendants, who had been in continuous possession and occupation of the land from and after the 19th of June, 1891, and is for possession and sale of the land, in default of payment of the mortgage made to them by Sootheran under the circumstances above related.\nTwo defences were set up to the action, first, notice of the fraud which had been committed by Sootheran, or such absence of inquiry as was equivalent to notice, and secondly, the Real Property Limitation Act.\nThe learned Chancellor held against the defendants on both grounds of defence, and granted a judgement for redemption and sale and for immediate possession which the Court of Appeal reversed.\nH.J. Scott K.C. for the appellants cited Murray v. East India Co.[2]\nWatson K.C. and Ruddy for the respondents referred to Ross v. Hunter[3]; Stephens v. Simpson[4].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This case has given me much trouble. The fact that the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of the Chancellor and that my brothers Sedgewick and Idington are unhesitatingly of opinion that the Court of Appeal was clearly right, whilst my brothers Davies and Nesbitt, with no less hesitation, say that it was clearly wrong, is, by itself, cogent evidence that the point in controversy, though reduced to a narrow compass, is not of an easy solution.\nAfter great hesitation I have come to the conclusion, with my brothers Sedgewick and Idington, that the appeal should be dismissed. In doing so, I am forced to confess that my best reason for it is that to doubt is to confirm.\nSEDGEWICK J. concurred with Idington J.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that the true construction of the Registry Act of Ontario, 87th section of chapter 136, Revised Statutes, is simply to give a registered conveyance affecting lands priority over an unregistered conveyance of the same lands, although the latter was first executed. The section does not avoid previous unregistered instruments absolutely, but only as against subsequent purchasers or incumbrancees for value without actual notice, whose conveyances are registered. For all other intents and purposes the unregistered conveyance is good.\nIn this case the parties, plaintiffs and defendants, were the innocent victims of the wilful fraud of one Sootheran.\nThe plaintiffs claimed the land in question as the registered mortgagees of the same under a conveyance from Sootheran.\nSootheran had previously conveyed to the defendants. The deed was not registered, the defendants being deceived into the belief that it was by a certificate of registry forged upon it by Sootheran. The single question for us to determine is whether the defendants had acquired a title by possession under the Statute of Limitations. The Court of Appeal held that as the unregistered prior deed to the defendants from Sootheran was, by the Registry Act, made void, it could not be invoked by the subsequent registered mortgagees to shew that Sootheran, after its execution, had no right of entry to the lands in question. They held that the Statute of Limitations did, consequently, apply to him. Being void they held that it was void under the statute ab initio, and that the defendants being in possession the Statute of Limitations began to run the day after Sootheran got his deed and became owner in fee of the lands, and that their possession had ripened into a statutory title before this action was begun.\nThe fallacy underlying this reasoning lies in the ignoring of the words of the section making the unregistered prior conveyance void only as against the subsequent conveyance registered. The unregistered deed to the defendants conveyed to them all Sootheran\u2019s title and interest. Such title and interest still remains, but it is made by the statute to rank after the mortgage subsequently executed but first registered. Sootheran had, after the execution of the deed to the defendants, no right of entry which any possession under the Statute of Limitations could bar. In fact the statute did not, and under the construction I place upon the Registry Act could not, apply to him. It follows, therefore, that, as against the plaintiffs, the defendants have not acquired any statutory title, and the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Chancellor restored.\nNESBITT J. (dissenting).\u2014I concur. The authorities seem to me to clearly establish that the only effect of the Registry Act is to give priority to the registered over the unregistered instruments, leaving the interests of the parties otherwise unaffected. New Brunswick Railway Co. v. Kelly[5].\nIf, as suggested, no legal title ever passed from Sootheran to the mortgagee, as he had already conveyed the legal title to the defendants and, therefore, no right of entry ever accrued to the mortgagees, the Statute of Limitations never became applicable between the parties, and the Registry Act gives the mortgagees the priority they claim.\nThe result of the judgment of the Court of Appeal and the majority of this court is that a person who is the legal and equitable owner in possession of land, and as to whom the Statute of Limitations cannot have any application (who has, by his own act, in executing a conveyance which has been registered enabled an innocent party to bring into play the Registry Act), can defeat the plain language of that Act creating priority against him by invoking a statute which had admittedly no application prior to the registration, and add a term of years as running which, in fact, was not running. 0 plus 5 = 10 is an arithmetical calculation I fail to appreciate. I would restore the judgment of the Chancellor.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014It is asked by the appellants: When did the right of entry accrue? They set up the outstanding estate vested in the respondents by Sootheran\u2019s deed to them to shew that it stood in the way of making entry until the mortgage to the appellants was registered.\nThis deed is, by virtue of the Registry Act, made void as against the appellants. It is not made, it is said, absolutely void, but only as against the subsequent mortgage. I grant that. But how far is it necessary to make it void to enable the mortgagee to assert a good title to the legal estate?\nIt must make it void back far enough to enable the mortgagee to shew a good paper title\u2014and that means beyond the time when the unregistered title began.\nThen, when it runs to that point, there is presupposed an absence of any other legal estate. There cannot be two at the same time.\nThere seems, therefore, no escape from the result that, in this case, by the assertion of their title, the appellants, of necessity, obliterate, by force of the Act that they invoke for their protection, any title that the court can, in this case, consider. The appellants cannot claim at one and the same moment a legal estate vested in them and also in their adversaries.\nThis is, after all, only another way of saying and illustrating what the late Chief Justice Draper and others said in correct legal phraseology as to the unregistered deed being void ab initio.\nI think the appeal should, for these and for the reasons assigned by the Court of Appeal, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Seth S.

Idington J. dissenting.\nIn Manitoba the Crown as represented by the Government of Canada may, in an action for damages for injuries to an employee, rely on the defence of common employment. Idington J. dissenting.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing the petition of the suppliant.\nThe suppliant sued as administratrix of the estate and effects of her son, one William Edward Ryder, deceased, and for the benefit of the brothers and sisters of the said deceased as well as of herself, claiming the sum of $5,000 damages for the loss and damage which she and various brothers and sisters of the deceased had sustained by reason of his death.\nThe deceased, William Edward Ryder, met his death on the 20th April, 1903, while in the employment of the Department of Public Works of Canada by an accident which occurred at the launching of a tug named \"Sir Hector,\" the property of the Government of Canada. The said tug was used in connection with certain dredging operations carried on by the Department of Public Works at the mouth of the Red River in the Province of Manitoba, and had been hauled out of the water for repairs on to the bank of a slough, part of the Red River.\nOn the said 20th of April, 1903, preparations were being made for launching the \"Sir Hector\" under the direction of Robert Francis Sweet, a dredge master in the employ of the Dominion Government, who was entrusted with the operation by Zepherin Malhoit, the resident engineer of the Department of Public Works in charge of the dredging operations.\nMr. Sweet had under him a foreman named John Davis, who was the foreman in charge of the launching, and about ten other men, including the deceased William Edward Ryder, were engaged under the foreman John Davis in the launching.\nWhile the preparations were still going on the vessel, by some accident, was prematurely launched, and John Davis, the foreman, and William Edward Ryder, were caught and crushed to death under her side as she moved down to the water.\nThe court gave judgment that the suppliant was not entitled to the releif sought by her petition of right.\nFred. Hope for the appellant. The Crown cannot rely on the defence of common employment, as the accident was due to a defective system. Webster v. Foley[2]; Brown v. Leelerc[3].\nUnder the Exchequer Court Act a provincial statute may apply to the Crown, though the latter is not named therein. The Workmen's Compensation Act of Manitoba so applies. Letourneux v. The King[4]; The Queen v. Martin[5]; Penny v. The Queen[6]; McDonald v. The King[7].\nNewcombe K.C., Deputy Minister of Justice, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nNESBITT J.\u2014This action was brought for the death of a servant of the Crown while engaged in the work of launching the Dominion steam tug \"Sir Hector,\" at or near Selkirk, in the Province of Manitoba. The judge of the Exchequer Court stated the defences as follows:\n1. That the accident did not occur on a public work.\n2. That it was not caused by negligence.\n3. That the negligence complained of (if any) was that of a fellow servant of the deceased, and the Crown is not liable therefor.\n4. That the Workmen's Compensation for Injuries Act (Manitoba) sec. 1, ch. 178, does not apply to this case.\nThe learned judge dealt only with the third and fourth defences, and I understood in the argument it was agreed against the conclusions he arrived at in reference to the third and fourth defences we should express no opinion on the very debatable questions involved in the first two defences referred to, but should remit the case for determination to the trial court.\nIn my view the cases of City of Quebec v. The Queen[8]; The Queen v. Filion[9]; The Queen v. Grenier[10]; and Letourneux v. The King(1); establish the doctrine that the Crown is liable to any person suffering injury in person or property or any public work resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment, such redress being sought for in the Court of Exchequer.\nThe liability is created according to those cases by the statute itself, and evidence that such injury resulted on a public work from the negligence of an officer or servant while acting within the scope of his duties, etc., is all that is necessary for the proof of the plaintiff's case. The action lies in law by force of the statute. It assumes, according to the reasoning contained in those cases, that the Crown can be guilty of negligence creating liability if such negligence is that of an officer or servant. It does not, however, deprive the Crown of the defences open; see The Queen v. Martin[11].\nWhat defences (at the date of the statute) would then have been open to an employer guilty of negligence? Since the decision of Priestley v. Fowler[12], it has been the established law of England that the employer could answer to his servants' negligence that such negligence was a risk assumed by the employed and so arose the doctrine known as \"common employment.\" I have dealt so fully with the authorities in the recent case of Canada Woollen Mills v. Traplin[13], that I need not reiterate. The statute does not take away this defence from the Crown. The Workmen's Compensation Act was passed not to create any new right of action, but to take away certain defences which were open under the authorities to the employer. The Manitoba statute does not purport to apply to the Crown even as represented in Manitoba, and in my view until the Crown is deprived by competent authority of such defence it is still open to it. I think this must have been the view of the Chief Justice of this court in the Filion Case[14], else the latter part of his judgment in that case is unexplainable, also his language in the Grenier Case[15], at p. 51. Appellant's counsel argued that this defence was not open, as he claimed the Crown would be liable in the cases where an employer would be, namely, for defective system or non-supply of adequate materials or proper machinery. I express no opinion as to what might be held in a proper case. Many considerations arise pro and con. This is not defective system. At the highest it is a negligent isolated act of the superintendent in not properly staying the boat, so that it slipped when the blocks were removed. I would dismiss the appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The question raised by this appeal is whether or not the Exchequer Court Act, 50 & 51 Vict ch. 16, sec. 16, created a liability or merely constituted a jurisdiction in the Exchequer Court to determine in regard to claims for or in respect to which liability existed already or might thereafter be created. It is as follows:\nThe Exchequer Court shall also have original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\u2014\n(a) Every claim against the Crown for property taken for any public purpose; (R.S.C. ch. 40, sec. 5).\n(b) Every claim against the Crown for damages to property injuriously affected by the. construction of any public work; (R.S.C. ch. 40, sec. 6).\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property on any public work, resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown, while acting within the scope of his duties or employment; (R.S.C. ch. 40, sec. 6). (d) Every claim against the Crown arising under any law of Canada or any regulation made by the Governor in Council; (R.S.U.S. sec. 1059(1)).\n(e) Every set-off, counterclaim, claim for damages, whether liquidated or unliquidated, or other demand whatsoever, on the part of the Crown, against any person making claim against the Crown. (R.S.U.S. sec. 1059(2).)\nShortly after this enactment came into force Sir Henry Strong, then Chief Justice of this court, in a most luminous and comprehensive judgment, if I might be permitted to say so, in The City of Quebec v. The Queen[16], dealt with this question.\nI cannot do better than adopt the exposition of the law as given in that judgment from pp. 426 to 430 of 24 Can. S.C.R., as applicable to the case now in hand. It reads as follows:\nThis subsection (d) which gives jurisdiction to the Exchequer Court to hear and determine \"every claim against the Crown arising under any law of Canada\" would indubitably and upon the direct authority of two recent decisions of the Privy Council, if the words \"under any law in Canada\" were eliminated, have the effect of giving a remedy to the subject against the Crown in all claims for damages for torts or delicts. In the case of Farnell v. Bowman[17], an appeal from New South Wales, it was held that the Government of that colony was liable to be sued in an action ex delicto under a statute providing \"that any person having or deeming himself to have any just claim or demand whatever against the Government\" might set forth the same in a petition to the governor, upon which petition a certain prescribed procedure being followed judicial relief might be obtained as in the case of an ordinary action between subject and subject. In this judgment it is said with reference to the proper construction of the statute: \"Thus unless the plain words are to be restricted, for any good reason, a complete remedy is given to any person having or deeming himself to have any just claim or demand whatsoever against the Government. These words are amply sufficient to include a claim for damages for a tort committed by the local Government by their servants.\"\nIn the case of the Attorney-General of the Straits Settlement v. Wemyss[18], the words of an ordinance authorizing a remedy by petition of right against the Crown for tortious acts were in words even mora opposite to the case before us; these worde were: \"Any claim against the Crown for damages or compensation arising in the colony shall be a claim cognizable under this ordinance.\"\nThe. Judical Committee in their judgment make the following observations upon the meaning of this provision:\u2014\"Their Lordships are of opinion that the expression \"claims against the Crown for damages or compensation\" is an apt expression to include claims arising out of torts, and that as claims arising out of contracts and other classes of claims are expressly mentioned, the words ought to receive their full meaning. In the case of Farnell v. Bowman[19], attention was directed by this committee to the fact that in many colonies the Crown was in the habit of undertaking works which in England are usually performed by private persons, and to the consequent expediency of providing remedies for injuries committed in the course of these works. The present case is an illustration of that remark. And there is no improbability, but the reverse, that when the legislature of a colony in such circumstances allows claims against the Crown in words applicable to claims upon torts, it should mean exactly what it expresses.\"\nThese two cases have a two-fold application here, first as shewing that the words \"any claim against the Crown\" are sufficiently comprehensive to include torts, more especially as the 15th section makes express provision for the case of claims arising from contracts; secondly, these judgments of the Privy Council lay down a rule or canon for the construction of colonial enactments by which the remedy of the subject against the Crown is enlarged, which it is the duty of this court to apply, as far as possible, to the Acts of Parliament now under consideration.\nIt being then established by the cases cited that the language of section 16, sub-section (d) \"every claim against the Crown\" is to have the wide construction before stated applied to it, which would include claims for damages arising ex delicto, we are next to inquire whether any and what restriction on the meaning which would be thus attributable to the expression in question, if it had stood alone, is imposed by the words \"arising under any law of Canada,\" which immediately follow.\nIt may be said that these are words of limitation which confine the clause to claims in respect of which some pre-existing law had imposed a liability on the part of the Crown. Again, it may be said that a \"law of Canada\" necessarily means not only some prior law of Canada, but must also exclusively refer to statute law. In support of this last proposition it might be said that there is no general common law prevailing throughout the Dominion of Canada, that each of the several provinces possesses its own private common law, and that the common law of the territories not included within any of the provinces depends on the enactments of the Dominion Parliament. This may be true, and is a necessary incident and result under every system of federal government where the several provinces or states forming the confederation have each its own separate and different system of private law. This has been recognized as a necessary consequence under the federal constitution of the United States, and that for a reason which would be equally applicable to Canada. It can make no difference that all the provinces, save one, derive their common law from that of England; the circumstance that the private law of one province, that of Quebec, is derived from a different source, makes it impossible to say that there is any system of law, apart from statute, generally prevalent throughout the Dominion. No inconvenience can result from this, since every case which could arise would be provided for by the law of some one or other of the provinces.\nWere I obliged to determine this question of construction as one on which the decision of this appeal depended I should probably come to the conclusion that the clause in question ought not to be so interpreted as to exclude claims in respect of torts and delicts, not referable to any prior statute of the Dominion, but being such as would, under the law of any of the provinces of Canada, have entitled parties to relief as between subject and subject. Taking the rule so clearly and emphatically laid down by the Privy Council in the cases before cited as a guide which we are bound to follow, it would appear to be proper that a wide and liberal construction, what is called a beneficial construction, should be placed upon the language of the legislature; a construction calculated to advance the rights of the subject by giving him an extended remedy. Proceeding upon this principle, we should, I think, be required to say that it was not intended merely to give a new remedy in respect of some pre-existing liability of the Crown, but that it was intended to impose a liability and confer a jurisdiction by which a remedy for such new liability might be administered in every case in which a claim was made against the Crown which, according to the existing general law, applicable as between subject and subject, would be cognizable by the courts. Further, I am of opinion that it would be right to hold that the words \"law of Canada\" did not mean exclusively a statute of the Dominion of Canada, but might be interpreted as meaning the law of any province of Canada which would have been appropriate for the decision of a particular claim in respect of a tort or delict if it had arisen between subjects of the Crown. It would not, I think, be taking any unwarrantable liberty with the language of the legislature so to interpret the words \"any law of Canada,\" for in a non-technical and popular sense the laws of the several provinces of Canada are laws of Canada, and the rule laid down by the cases before cited requires us to give the terms used the most favorable and comprehensive construction possible.\nMr. Justice Gwynne, in the same case, recognized almost as distinctly, though not using express words to that effect, that this legislation created a liability as well as established a jurisdiction. The judgment of the court in that case, by reason of the facts in the opinion of the court falling short of bringing the case within the Act, even if it were to be assumed capable of the construction that it created a liability, left no binding decision in accord with the opinions thus expressed. The head-note in the report is in accord with the opinions expressed, but obviously is misleading in this regard if taken as the decision.\nA few months later, in The Queen v. Filion[20], the majority of this court decided that the Crown, at all events as to the Province of Quebec, had become liable for the negligence of its officers in a case within the Act. Chief Justice Strong and the late Mr. Justice Gwynne clearly treated the case as if liability had been created as well as jurisdiction given by this Act.\nThe Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Sedgewick assumed that that had been decided in the former case. Mr. Justice Gwynne does not refer to the former case, but is most explicit in his language in expressing the opinion that the Act created a new liability and that thereby the Crown had become responsible, for he says:\nI am of opinion that the language of the above Dominion statute is sufficient to give the persons suffering injury in person or property or any public work resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment, a right to redress, even though they may have had none before, such redress being sought for in the Court of Exchequer. Mr. Justice Sedgewick, whilst adopting the opinion of Mr. Justice Gwynne in the former case, incidentally points out that in Quebec the doctrine of collaborateur did not obtain as it had in England.\nThis adoption of the principle thus reached and acted upon, I think, binds us now. It has been recognized in many cases since, needless to refer to, except in the case of Letourneux v. The King[21], where the present Chief Justice of the court delivering the judgment of the court (from which only Mr. Justice Davies dissented, although, I take it, not on the ground of the principle I have referred to being wrong, but on other grounds) expressly says:\nBy section 23 it was enacted that any claim against the Crown may be prosecuted by Petition of Right, and sections 15 and 16 give exclusive original jurisdiction to the Exchequer Court so that this action lies in law. Such is the jurisprudence of this court as finally settled by The Queen v. Filion[22].\nAnd again he says:\nAnd upon the authority of The Queen v. Filion (2), under sections 16, 23 and 58 of the Exchequer Court Act, this right of action cannot be controverted.\nThis is important not only as the deliverance of the majority of the court, but as coming from the present Chief Justice, who had originally dissented from the rest of the Court in the case of The Queen v. Filion (2).\nBecause of the result having been reached in this indirect way, I have set forth at length the process of reasoning and facts so that what was meant, and what follows, may be better understood.\nThe way in which Sir Henry Strong puts the matter when he implies, rather than says, that the whole of the sub-sections must be read as parts, of which each depends for its operative force upon the reference by the sub-section (d), to the \"law of Canada,\" may lead to different results from following that on which the late Mr. Justice Gwynne apparently puts it as resting, for each class of injury or compensation, upon each independent sub-section respectively giving a right and a remedy appropriate thereto.\nThe case of Attorney-General of the Straits Settlement v. Wemyss[23] seems expressly in point as upholding the latter view, and applicable here, and the necessity for relying upon the Manitoba Workmen's Compensation for Injuries Act need not in that way be resorted to.\nThe Crown is, by the other way, made liable whensoever and wheresoever the negligence of a servant would have rendered a private individual master liable therefor.\nI think it must be taken in either case as the result of this history that it has been deliberately determined after full consideration that, in the words of Sir Henry Strong already quoted:\nThe act was intended to impose a liability and confer a jurisdiction by which a remedy for such liability might be administered.\nIf the question should be again agitated and be determined differently from the result about to be declared in this case, the final consideration may call for a determination of the exact legal results that I am not called upon to decide.\nThe Workmen's Compensation Acts in Manitoba and in Ontario and elsewhere have restrictions upon the amount to be recovered, and otherwise. These restrictions would probably be inoperative if the liability as well as remedy is created independently of any provincial legislation and merely by force of sub-section (c) itself.\nIt may be that by a consideration of the whole legislation under review and having regard to the object aimed at, of removing the historical distinction in favour of the Crown and the desirability of removing a distinction in results derivable from intrinsically the same relations under another or different form the way may be found to interpret so as to effect these objects.\nThe policy of this section 16 (as a group or as independent sub-sections) of the Exchequer Act is, clearly, to put the relation between the Crown and its subjects, and all issues springing therefrom, in regard to the several matters dealt with by such legislation, upon the same footing as between subject and subject.\nThis result may not be exactly obtained by adopting either of such interpretations as I have adverted to.\nNo canon of construction is violated, however, in adopting either. The modern trend of legislation seems in accord with some such construction.\nI do not understand that the opinion of the majority of the court now denies this principle of liability as having been created by the Act and as still existing.\nIt would seem rather as if they found such limitations of the liability as to exclude servants, suffering from the negligence of fellow-servants, from the benefits of the Act, unless where brought within its beneficial operations by reason of special legislation or the state of the law at the time of the enactment under consideration.\nI am unable to concur in this.\nI cannot think that the suggestion to look upon the doctrine of common employment simply as a defence is a sound one.\nWith great respect I am bound to say that the suggestion seems to me to spring from a misconception of and misapplication of the legal principles involved.\nAt least ever since Priestley v. Fowler[24], it had been, until remedied by legislation, English law that no action would lie against the master for injuries arising from the negligence of a competent fellow-servant.\nThere was by that case, if not before, held to be an implied contract that the suffering servant had assumed that responsibility and risk and that the master had not to answer for the others of his servants in that regard.\nIt is not a matter of defence such a payment; as accord and satisfaction; as release; or as the Statute of Limitations, which had to be pleaded in bar.\nIf sued by a servant for negligence of a competent fellow-servant, the master could plead \"not guilty,\" but required no other defence. Sometimes, even before the modern loose system of pleading, pleas can be found (where the declaration had not truly and explicitly set the facts forth), in answer to such a declaration alleging that the accident arose from the neglect of such a fellow-servant, but in cases where the facts and cause of action had been properly set out in the declaration and were not complicated with other considerations such as the incompetence of the fellow-servant or like consideration, a demurrer or the simple plea of \"not guilty,\" would have been all that was required. See Deverill v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[25], and Degg v. Midland Railway Co.[26]. Hence when the Employers' Liability Act in England and the Workmen's Compensation Acts of Ontario, Manitoba and elsewhere came to be enacted, each of them proceeded not by removing a defence, but by creating a liability.\nSo far as the cases covered by sub-sec. (c), sec. 16, now in question, are concerned, the liability of the Crown was created thereby and unlimited if no other legislation, local or general, imposed a barrier.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and the matter referred back to the Exchequer Court for trial or completion of trial.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Heap & Heap.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

A power of attorney was given to one of the parties to purchase said assets, which was done, payment being made by the discount of a note for $2,000 made by H. and indorsed by another of the parties. The company having been formed the said assets were transferred and the said note was retired by a note of the company for $4,000 indorsed by H., which he afterwards had to pay. H. also, or the company in Buffalo of which he was manager, advanced money to a considerable amount for the company which eventually went into liquidation. After the company was formed, in pursuance of the original agreement between the parties, stock was issued to each of them as fully paid up according to the amounts for which they respectively subscribed, and in the winding-up proceedings they were respectively placed on the list of contributories for the total amount of said stock. The ruling of the local master in this respect was affirmed by a judge of the High Court and by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Davies and Nesbitt JJ. dissenting, that as all the proceedings were in good faith and there was no misrepresentation of material facts, and as H. and S. had paid full value for their shares, the agreement by which they received them as fully paid up was valid and the order making them contributories should be rescinded. Held, per Davies and Nesbitt JJ. that as they did not pay cash or its equivalent for any portion of the shares as such the order should stand.\nHeld, also, that it is the duty of the Supreme Court, if satisfied that the judgment in appeal is erroneous, to reverse it even when it represents the concurring view of three, or any number of, successive courts before which the case has been heard.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson, who upheld the ruling of the local master placing the appellants on the list of contributories of the Baden Manufacturing Co., in process of being wound up under R.S.C. ch. 129.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments given on this appeal.\nAylesworth K.C. and Robertson (Segsworth with them) for the appellants referred to Kelner v. Baxter[1]; Natal Land & Colonization Co. v. Pauline Colliery Syndicate[2].\nHaight for the respondent cited North-West Electric Co. v. Walsh[3]; In re Hess Mfg. Co.[4]\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The appellants were each subscribers for twenty-five shares of the stock of the Baden Machinery Manufacturing Company, Limited, a company incorporated under The Ontario Companies Act by letters patent, dated August 27th, 1902. The stock is of the par value of $100 per share, and the appellants claim that their stock is paid up, as their stock certificates state. In winding up proceedings before the local master at Berlin under the Winding Up Act, R.S.C. ch. 129, an order was made placing the appellants on the list of contributories for the sum of $2,500 each, being the full par value of their stock. That order was confirmed by Mr. Justice Ferguson, and the Court of Appeal for Ontario have dismissed an appeal taken by the appellants from his order. The present appeal is from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nThe facts of the case are rather complicated. They are substantially as follows:\nFor some time prior to the formation of the Baden Machinery Manufacturing Company a firm of Oelschlager Brothers had carried on business as manufacturers of wood-working machinery at Baden, where they had a large plant and a factory, subject to encumbrances. Their interest in the property, valued as a going concern, was worth from $17,000 to $25,000. The firm had, however, heavy debts to banks and others. They had no cash capital, one of the brothers was intemperate, and both were poor business men. They had, in consequence, lost their credit and were on the eve of failure.\nThe appellants were officers of the Buffalo Tool and Machine Company, doing business at Buffalo, N.Y., and having a branch place of business at Toronto. Their company had given orders for machines to Oelschlager Brothers, and had trouble in getting their orders filled. Inquiry by Hood as to the cause led to his discovery of the financial difficulties of Oelschlager Bros. On his suggesting assistance he was visited in Buffalo by Oelschlager Brothers and by one Oliver Master, a broker from Berlin, who was then liable to the banks for about $2,600 upon paper he had indorsed for the accommodation of Oelschlager Brothers, and which he would have to pay unless he could get some one else to come to the rescue. Master called over to Buffalo one W.M. Cram, a solicitor practising at Berlin, who was in the same position as Master with respect to Oelschlager Brothers.\nMaster and Cram having suggested to Hood, as a solution of all their difficulties, the formation of a joint stock company, it was agreed among them that Cram should acquire the property of Oelschlager Brothers on the best terms he could as trustee for Hood, Snow and Master, and undertake on their behalf to pay the debts of Oelschlager Brothers, and that thereupon a company should be formed, to which the property with its encumbrances might be transferred, Hood undertaking for himself and Snow to give such financial assistance from time to time as might be required to carry on the undertaking, and that in consideration Hood, Snow and Master should receive paid-up stock in the company to the amount of $10,000, that being the value placed by them on their interest in the property (valued as a going concern) after it had the financial assistance promised by Hood and Snow. Hood represented Snow as well as himself in these transactions.\nTo carry out their plan, on the 29th July, 1902, Hood, Snow and Master signed a document appointing Cram their attorney and trustee to acquire and hold for their use and benefit the property of Oelschlager Brothers. Cram, in exercise of that authority, acquired the property, consisting of the plant and factory before mentioned, in consideration of the payment of $1,155 and the assumption of the encumbrances upon the property and of certain debts of Oelschlager Brothers to banks and others.\nThe transfer from Oelschlager Brothers was not completed until the 9th August, 1902, as appears by the affidavit of execution of the bill of sale. In the meantime, Hood, in pursuance of the agreement to aid financially, had given his promissory note for $2,000 to Master on the 6th August, 1902. The proceeds of this note were to be used to pay off certain encumbrances and to carry on the concern, but $1,155 of the proceeds was actually used by Cram to pay to Oelschlager Brothers the cash consideration on the purchase of their property.\nPending the completion of arrangements, Cram continued the factory as a going concern, and for that purpose requiring the sum of $700, applied to Hood, and he procured the acceptance by the Buffalo Tool and Machine Company of a draft, dated 8th August, 1902, for $700, in Cram\u2019s favour, and the proceeds were used in the Baden business. Again, on the 13th September, 1902, Cram required $1,200 to pay off the lien and mortgage of one Petrie, covering portions of the plant, and again Hood procured the acceptance by the Buffalo Tool and Machine Company of a draft for that amount in Cram\u2019s favour, and the Petrie claims were paid out of the proceeds.\nOn the 27th of August, 1902, letters patent were issued incorporating the Baden Machinery Manufacturing Company, Limited, the objects of the corporation being \u201cto manufacture and dispose of engines and boilers and wood-working and other machinery, and to repair machinery.\u201d Hood, Snow and Master were the provisional directors, and they called the first general meeting of shareholders for the 17th day of October, 1902.\nAt the shareholders\u2019 meeting on October 17th, 1902, the agreement or arrangement proposed\u201d to be made by Hood, Snow and Master with the company as before set forth was put before the meeting.\nThere were present at this meeting all the shareholders except Snow and Carter. Snow was repre- sented by his proxy, Hood. Carter, who was an employee of the Buffalo Tool and Machine Company, and whose $1,000 of stock was to form part of the $10,000 paid-up stock, had had the proposed arrangement submitted to him when he was asked to subscribe, and had assented to it, and in fact it was a proposal entirely for his benefit, and it was only upon that understanding he had subscribed. All the shareholders present assented to the arrangement, and in pursuance thereof certificates were, on the same day, issued to Hood, Snow and Master for the stock they had subscribed for, as fully paid-up stock.\nThe company forthwith took over the plant and factory and continued the business theretofore carried on. On the 1st November, 1902, the company took up Hood\u2019s $2,000 note by giving the company\u2019s own note for $4,000, dated November 1st, 1902, which, however, it was necessary to have indorsed by both Hood and Snow before discounting it. This $4,000 note was eventually paid up by Hood out of moneys obtained by him for the purpose from the Buffalo Tool and Machine Company. The company also, from time to time, made provision for the debts of Oelschlager Brothers at the banks as well as for some of their own debts.\nFor these and other purposes of the company, such as payment of wages, frequent application was made to Hood for financial assistance, which Hood obtained for the company from his own company, the Buffalo Tool and Machine Company. These applications were in pursuance of the agreement, before stated, which provided, among its other terms, that the stock of Hood and Snow should be paid-up stock, and no other agreement was ever made in reference thereto. The total amount obtained by the Baden Company from Hood for the enterprise from the time of taking over the Oelschlager property exceeded $13,000, not one dollar of which was ever returned. Certain machinery, amounting in value, at the outside price, to $2,675, was delivered to the Buffalo Tool and Machine Company, by the Baden Company, but it had no connection with the advances made, and, in fact, none of the machinery was shipped until after advances aggregating between $5,000 and $6,000 had been made.\nThe net result, as appears by the liquidator\u2019s report, so far as creditors are concerned, has been that the $6,000 indebtedness of Oelschlager Brothers has been reduced to an indebtedness of less than $2,000, leaving aside the claim of Hood and Snow and the Buffalo Tool and Machine Company, in respect of advances made.\nOn the 18th day of May, 1903, an order was made to wind up the company, and the respondent was appointed liquidator. The plant at Baden had prior thereto been seized under execution and sold by the sheriff. The liquidator obtained an order for payment over to him of the proceeds of the sale of the plant, and still claims to hold such proceeds as the property of the company, and has not in any manner offered to hand over such proceeds to those from whom the company obtained such property, nor has he in any way applied to set aside, or to have the company relieved from, the agreement under which the property was obtained.\nUnder these circumstances the appellants claim that they are entitled to hold their stock as fully paid under the terms of the agreement made on the 17th October, 1902, as if paid in cash; that the company has, by receiving all the benefits provided for it by such agreement in taking over the property purchased from Oelschlager Brothers and in receiving to a much larger amount than the value of the stock the financial assistance promised by Hood on behalf of himself and Snow, and by issuing certificates for paid-up stock, and by assuming as between the company and Hood, Snow and Master, the debts of Oelschlager Brothers and Hood\u2019s note for $2,000, affirmed that agreement; that the liquidator has re-affirmed it by claiming from the sheriff the proceeds of the sale of the plant; and that he cannot in this proceeding repudiate that part of the agreement which is for the appellants\u2019 benefit.\nThe appellants further say that even if what took place on the 17th October, 1902, did not amount to a formal agreement binding upon the company as such, an implied agreement to the same effect arose by reason of what was done on the faith of the understanding between the parties.\nThe case as I view it is entirely one of inferences of fact from the facts proved and the application to it of incontrovertible law. It seems to me clear upon the evidence that the appellants have given real and valid consideration for their stock.\nMr. Justice Sedgewick has put in writing the reasons upon which the majority of the court have come to the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed. I have only a few words to add. The respondent has not failed to resort to the stock argument on appeals of this class of cases, that upon a question of fact he has the concurrent finding of three courts below in his favour. Now, in the first place, there are no controverted facts of any importance here. The case rests principally upon inferences of law and facts from admitted or uncontradicted facts. And, sec- ondly, it must not be forgotten that, when the statute allows of an appeal on facts, even if concurred in by three courts, as here, it is on the assumption, as in all cases, that there may be error in all these judgments, and the respondent is not entitled to invoke as an argument in his favour the very judgment that the appellant complains of.\nIt is our duty, in every case, to give the judgment that the Court of Appeal should, in our opinion, have given. The fact that two or three courts have passed upon a question of fact does not relieve us from the responsibility of judging of the evidence as we view it. If, in this case, we think that the local master came to a wrong conclusion, it is not simply because two successive appeals from his findings have failed that the appeal to us must also fail. When the statute gives an appeal to any court it never imposes the condition that the judgment must not be reversed. We have repeatedly had to reverse on questions of fact; Russell v. Lefran\u00e7ois[5]; The North British & Mercantile Ins. Co. v. Tourville[6]; Dempster v. Lewis[7]; and, as long as the right to appeal as to findings of fact exists, we have to continue to do so every time that we are convinced that there is error in the judgment complained of, whatever may be the number of courts or of judges that the respondent has previously succeeded in leading into error.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014There is nothing at common law to prevent two mercantile establishments carrying on two separate businesses uniting for the purpose of forming a new partnership, each association contributing as its share of the capital of the new partnership whatever property it may possess. And in the absence of bad faith or fraud there is nothing to prevent the members of the new partnership from allotting as among themselves the share of the capital with which each member of the partnership may afterwards be credited, even although the amount so allotted to him may be from a purely monetary point of view largely in excess of its market value. In other words, members of a partnership for mutual convenience may agree among themselves that the nominal capital may exceed, without reference whatever to amount, what from one point of view may be deemed to be the real capital. And if afterwards the original members, or other members coming in after the original members choose to form themselves and do form themselves into a joint stock company under the Ontario Companies Act, it being agreed that the whole assets of the partnership shall become the capital and the Only capital of the company, the same results follow. The members of the new company in such a case would have just as much right as the former partnership to agree among themselves as to the figure at which the capital stock of the company shall be put down, whether that figure is actually in accordance with the fact, or is more or less fictitious. Admitting that in such proceeding there was no fraud, accident or mistake, no failure on the part of any one to disclose material facts, the complete and adequate knowledge on the part of every member as to the exact condition of affairs, all parties being sui juris and of disposing mind and understanding, no court of justice would or could entertain an action to set aside such an agreement, whether such action is brought by a shareholder or by any subsequent member of the company. It would be otherwise were it necessary in order to the raising of additional capital that the prospectus should be issued, and after the formation and complete organization of the company there had been left in the treasury or unallotted stock for the purpose of inducing the public to purchase these shares so undisposed of. In that case the original members of the company or its executive would be under certain legal and equitable obligations to the owners of the new stock company in regard to the actual accuracy and the utmost fidelity to proof as between them and the new members.\nThe company now being wound up was not a company of the latter, but of the former kind. Upon its organization a meeting was held at which every shareholder or the representative of every shareholder was present. Whatever negotiations may have taken place prior to the 17th October, 1902, to my mind it is clearly established by evidence, the evidence, too, of the respondent\u2019s witnesses (see the evidence of Oliver Master) that on that day, before the stock had been divided, there was a meeting of all of the shareholders of the company, every one of whom was either present or his representatives were present, and it was unanimously agreed that the stock in the company, as mentioned in the charter of incorporation, should be wholly divided up amongst the then existing shareholders in certain proportions, and that this verbal understanding was on the same day carried out by the secretary and president of the company issuing under the seal of the company certificates for fully paid-up shares to the amount just agreed upon, and the two appellants now hold these certificates as evidence of their immunity from further liability in respect to the shares so transferred to them. The evidence shews that the whole transaction was one of the most perfect good faith; that the property brought into the business by the corporators was in the view of every one approximate, at least, to the stated amount of the company\u2019s capital. There was no suggestion of any fraud, imposition, mistake, failure to disclose material facts or anything to suggest any desire on the part of the company or any officer or member of it to defraud anybody, whether as between themselves or any future creditors.\nSome time afterwards, the company having become financially embarrassed, a winding-up order was made and the two appellants were placed upon the list of contributories in order to pay the full amount of the capital stock held by them, as if nothing had been paid at all. I am of opinion that this transaction cannot now be impeached by the company\u2019s liquidator.\nSome point was made in the court below that the agreement come to at the meeting of the 17th September not having been made a matter of record in the minutes of the company, no evidence could be given by oral testimony shewing that the agreement was. I have never found, apart from statutory enactment, where evidence of that kind was held properly rejected. The company may bind itself in many cases by simple silence; it may as effectively bind itself by verbal communication made by its responsible executive officers. A fortiori, when not only its executive, but every possible shareholder comes to an agreement as to a certain proceeding, and that agreement is followed up by a legal transfer under sale of the property, the subject matter of the discussion, the agreement in question, in absence of evidence to the contrary, must be held to be valid and binding, not only as between the shareholders but as between themselves and the whole world. I am of opinion the appeal should be allowed and the appellants\u2019 names struck off the list of contributories. The appellants will have their costs in all the courts below.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I concur in the judgment allowing the appeal with costs and striking the appellants\u2019 names off the list of contributories, for the reasons stated by my brother Sedgewick.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed, and will add very few words to the reasons given for the judgment of the Court of Appeal by the Chief Justice of that court.\nThe appeal turns largely, if not entirely, upon questions of fact. The three courts below have found these facts against the appellant and the question for us to determine is whether they have properly appreciated the evidence.\nThe main question is whether the appellants as promoters of the company being wound up occupied such a fiduciary position towards the company at the time of its formation as prevented them from making any secret profit out of the sale to the company of the Oelschlager business and property which they had previously acquired.\nI am clearly of the opinion that they, together with Master, did occupy such fiduciary position and that on the formation of the company which they had promoted, and of which they and Master became the directors, it was not legal for them to issue to themselves as paid-up shares of the company shares which as a fact were unpaid, and the alleged payment for which alone consisted in the profit which they charged the company in the sale to it of the Oelschlager business. The facts in the case are as conclusive as the law. On the 26th July the appellants Hood and Snow, together with Master, Cram and Oelschlager, signed a memo of agreement to become incorporated as a company under the provisions of the Ontario Companies Act under the name of the Baden Machinery Manufacturing Company, Limited, with a capital of $40,000, divided into 400 shares of $100 each, and severally agreeing to\ntake the respective amount of the capital stock of the company set opposite their respective names as hereunder and hereafter written and to become shareholders in such company to the said amounts.\nThis was signed on the 26th July by Hood for $2,500, by Master for $2,500, by Cram for $100, and Oelschlager for $1,000. On the 29th July Snow signed for $2,500, and in August two other shareholders signed.\nThe three promoters of the company about to be formed, namely, Hood, Master and Snow, on the latter date of 29th July\u2014and after the execution of the above memorandum\u2014executed a power of attorney to one of the other promoters, Cram, in the following words:\nWe and each of us hereby nominate and appoint William Moffatt Cram our attorney and trustee, to acquire and hold for our and each of our use and benefit, the property owned by William Oelschlager, and the property owned by Henry Oelschlager, of Baden, and any other property owned by Oelschlager Brothers, of Baden, the said property to be acquired and held as aforesaid, for the purpose of a joint stock company, proposed to be formed with us as provisional directors, and this is the said Cram\u2019s authority for so doing, and we hereby authorize him to do whatsoever may be necessary in the premises.\nThe Oelschlager property was then almost immediately purchased by Cram under this power of attorney, namely, on the 4th August following, who, after letters incorporating the company had been issued, assigned and handed over the property to it. Letters patent constituting Hood, Snow, Master and Cram a body incorporate under the name of the Baden Machinery Manufacturing Company were issued 27th August, 1902, and Hood, Snow and Master were named provisional directors of the company.\nThe first meeting of these provisional directors was held 4th October, when it was decided to call a general meeting of the company on the 17th day of October for \u201cthe purpose of organization,\u201d and to demand a transfer to the company of the property from Cram.\nThis transfer was promptly executed by Cram and at the organization meeting held 17th October, Hood was elected President, Snow one of the directors and Master Secretary\u2011Treasurer and director.\nOn the same day twenty-five shares of stock each were issued to Hood and Snow, but the local judge held as the evidence shewed that although the stock was issued as fully paid-up stock, nothing, in fact, had been paid by either of these parties. They were consequently held liable on the subsequent winding up of the company to pay the amount of this stock so issued to them, and from this decision successive appeals up to this present one have been taken.\nThe facts are complicated by a $2,000 note which at the time of the purchase of the Oelschlager property Hood signed in favour of Master, which was discounted and the proceeds applied, $1,155 in paying Oelschlager and the balance in carrying on the business after the purchase. It was, however, stipulated by Hood from the first that this $2,000 should be assumed with other liabilities by the new company, and this was afterwards done by the company issuing its note for $4,000, and Hood got back his $2,000 note. This $2,000 note may therefore be eliminated from the transaction, and when that is done there would not be a dollar paid by Hood either actually or ostensibly towards the purchase of the property.\nIt was properly admitted by Mr. Aylesworth that this $2,000 did not in any way constitute a payment for the shares issued to Hood, or have anything to do as consideration for these shares.\nWhat was contended was that the purchase of the Oelschlager property by their attorney, Cram, was entirely a personal one by Hood, Snow and Master for themselves, and not for the company, and that they were under no personal fiduciary relationships with regard to the sale of that property to the company, but could do with it as they liked after its purchase, and, having sold it to the company they were justified in taking as and for their own profit the paid\u2011up shares for which they had subscribed, and that the absence of any record in the minutes of the company authorizing the issue of such shares as paid-up shares made no difference if the fact was as they alleged that it was understood and agreed that they should be so issued.\nI am quite unable to put this construction upon the Cram power of attorney, or to accept the reasoning of Mr. Aylesworth upon this point.\nAt the time this power of attorney was given these parties, Hood and Master, had, together with Cram, executed the agreement subscribing for their stock in the proposed company. They were promoters of that company in every sense of the word within the definition of that term as given by Lord Cairns L.C., in Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Company[8], at p. 1236. They authorize Cram to purchase the pro- perty \u201cfor the purpose of a joint stock company proposed to be formed by us as provisional directors.\u201d They afterwards complete the formation of the company and as provisional directors call upon Cram to assign the property to the company, which he at once does, and which assignment they as provisional directors of the company accept.\nI am of opinion that on these facts the appellants under the authorities clearly occupied as promoters a fiduciary position towards the company, and as such could not be permitted to issue to themselves as secret profit paid-up shares of the company, and where they have done so the shares can, in a winding-up proceeding such as this, be treated as unpaid shares. See Chief Justice Strong\u2019s judgment In re Hess Manufacturing Company[9]. See also In re Olympia Limited[10], and on appeal to the House of Lords under the title of Gluckstein v. Barnes[11], especially the observations of Lord Robertson at p. 256.\nThe law is clear that the consideration which must be paid or given for shares in order that they may be considered paid up and that the holders may not be held liable as contributories in a winding up must be a real, valid and bon\u00e2 fide consideration in cash or its equivalent actually paid or transferred and that nothing less will suffice. North-West Electric Co. v. Walsh[12]; Ooregum Gold Mining Co. v. Roper[13].\nThis is sufficient to dispose of the appeal, and if it were not, I desire to say that I fully share the opinion expressed by the Court of Appeal that the oral evidence given to establish an agreement for these shares as paid-up shares in the face of the record of the min- utes of the company, which is absolutely silent on the subject, is altogether too vague and unsatisfactory to justify any affirmative holding, even if admissible at all to supplement such minutes.\nNESBITT J. (dissenting).\u2014I confess I have been greatly troubled in this case. The question is one solely of fact, and were it not that three courts have found the facts against the appellants, I should have thought the view so ably argued for by Mr. Aylesworth entitled to prevail. At one time I thought the Chief Justice in the court below had taken a wrong view of the effect of the statement that the goods were purchased for the company to be formed, and so gone wrong in the result, but I am satisfied he only viewed it as a circumstance shewing there was no intention to have the stock issued for the consideration of the transfer of the goods, and that the company, as it was originally intended, paid for the goods by note (which subsequently was left unpaid) and assumed the liabilities of Oelschlager Brothers, and that the stock was issued as paid up when in fact no legal consideration was given to the company. Had the company paid the $4,000 note it would have paid for the goods, etc., for which it is now claimed the stock was issued.

The motion was, in the alternative, for leave to appeal per saltum from the order of Mr. Justice McLeod dated the 15th day of September, ordering and directing the winding up of the company, or for leave to appeal from the previous judgment of the Supreme Court of the 12th September.\nAs a matter of fact Mr. Justice McLeod made no formal order in the matter of the winding-up proceedings until after the appeal court of New Brunswick had given their judgment. In fact he declined to do so, stating at the close of his opinion that:\nAs the matter is a very important one I will not make an order now, but I will order it to go by way of appeal to the Supreme Court, and I will order it to be entered on the motion paper to-morrow morning, and if there is any difficulty then, it may be treated as a reference from me and I will act on the order of the court.\nWhen the matter, therefore, came before the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, it was more in the nature of a reference than in the nature of an appeal.\nIf I granted an appeal from their judgment it would seem to me to be a purely academic one. I am of opinion, under the 76th section of the Act, that leave to appeal per saltum cannot be allowed, and as there was no formal judgment given by Mr. Justice McLeod before the 15th September, from which an appeal could be taken to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, I do not think I can grant leave to appeal from the judgment or order made by the latter court on the 12th September. As a matter of fact, the judges in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick were equally divided, and the order made was \"that this appeal drop and be dismissed, the court being equally divided.\"\nIn my opinion the proper course is for the parties desiring to appeal to take an appeal out from the formal order for winding up, signed by Mr. Justice McLeod, of the 15th September, to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and apply subsequently to a judge of this court for leave to appeal from the disposition that court may make on the appeal to it.\nThe application, therefore, will be dismissed with costs, and as the case presents very special features which, in my judgment, justify special counsel in attending, I fix the costs at $50.\nOn the merits of the case I desire to be understood as expressing no opinion whatever.\nApplication dismissed with costs.\n",

AND MR. JUSTICE TEETZEL.\nControverted election\u2014Secrecy of ballot\u2014Act of D.R.O.\u2014Numbering ballot.\nUnder the Dominion Controverted Elections Act a ballot cast at an election is avoided if there are any marks thereon by which the voter may be identified whether made by him or not. Hence, when the deputy returning officer in a polling district placed on each ballot the number corresponding to that opposite the elector's name on the voters' list the ballots were properly rejected. Judgment appealed from (9 Ont. L.R. 201) affirmed, Sedgewick and Idington JJ. dissenting.\nAppeal from the judgment of Chief Justice Sir William R. Meredith and Mr. Justice Teetzel[1], avoiding the election of the respondent Smith for the Electoral District of Wentworth, Ont.\nThe following case was stated for the opinion of the judges assigned to try the election petition:\n\"1. The election above referred to was holden on the 27th day of October and the 3rd day of November, A.D., 1904, when the petitioner William Oscar Sealey and Ernest Disraeli Smith were the candidates. \"2. Pursuant to the provisions of the Dominion Elections Act, the returning officer for the said election did by proclamation indicate and name the time when and the place where he would add up the number of votes given to each of the candidates at said election, namely: Thursday, the 10th day of November, A.D. 1904, at the hour of 10 a.m., at the Town of Dundas, in the said electoral district, and at the said time and place the said returning officer did add up the number of votes given to each of the said candidates, and did declare the petitioner William Oscar Sealey to have received 2,938 votes, and did declare the respondent to have received 2,918 votes, and did declare the petitioner duly elected.\n\"3. Pursuant to the provisions of the Dominion Elections Act a recount was held before the senior judge of the county court of the County of Wentworth at Hamilton on the 18th day of November, 1904, and on the 21st day of November, 1904.\n\"4. The said judge after the conclusion of the said recount and final addition certified to the returning officer that the petitioner, William Oscar Sealey, had received 2,889 votes, and that the respondent, Ernest Disraeli Smith, had received 2,899 votes, and the said returning officer thereupon declared the respondent duly elected.\n\"5. At the poll in polling sub-division No. 23 of the said electoral district the deputy returning officer on each ballot, before handing the ballot to a voter to mark, put the same number on the back of the ballot as was put opposite such voter's name in the poll book used at said poll, and such numbers still remain on the back of the said ballots and in the said poll book.\n\"6. At the poll mentioned in the preceding paragraph 47 ballots were marked for the petitioner and 22 for the respondent.\n\"7. On the said recount the judge disallowed and declined to count for either candidate any of the ballots cast at said polling sub-division No. 23, on the grounds that in his opinion the numbers on the back of each ballot was a mark by which the voter could be identified.\n\"8. Pursuant to the provisions of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, on the 25th day of November, 1904, the petitioner filed his petition herein, and on the 10th day of December, 1904, the respondent herein filed his cross-petition against the said William Oscar Sealey.\n\"9. The time for the trial of said petitions has been fixed for Wednesday, the 1st day of February next, at the court house in the City of Hamilton, at which time and place it is agreed it shall proceed.\n\"10. On the trial of said petition and cross-petition no witnesses shall be called and no evidence shall be given except the above stated case, and the facts herein set forth and the inspection by the court of the poll book and ballots used at said election at said polling sub-division No. 23, and the deductions to be drawn therefrom and all the other charges contained in said petition shall be dismissed without costs and the said cross-petition shall be dismissed without costs.\n\"The questions for the opinion of the court are:\n\"First: Is the respondent, E. D. Smith, the duly elected member for the Electoral District of Wentworth?\nSecondly: If not, is the petitioner, W. O. Sealey, the duly elected member for the said Electoral District of Wentworth? \"Thirdly: Or is the said election for the Electoral District of Wentworth null and void?\"\nOn said case the trial judges reported as follows:\n\"The undersigned two of the justices of the High Court of Justice for Ontario assigned to try the above petition and cross-petition do hereby certify that on the first and second days of February, A.D. 1905, at the City of Hamilton, in the above electoral district, we held a court for the trial of and there tried the petition and cross-petition between the said parties respecting the above election.\n\"By agreement between the parties all matters in dispute in the said petition were comprised in a case stated for the opinion of the court pursuant to section 49 of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, and all charges of corrupt practices were abandoned and no witnesses were examined at the trial.\n\"After hearing what was alleged by counsel on both sides:\n\"We find and report that neither of the parties to the said petition and cross-petition of the candidates at the said election was duly elected and that the said election was and is void.\n\"In the said petition and cross-petition of the respondent charges were made that corrupt practices had been committed at the said election, but all the said charges were abandoned and no evidence was given in support thereof. We repeat, therefore, that no corrupt practice was proven before us to have been committed by or with the knowledge or consent of either of the candidates at the said election.\n\"We have no means of forming a belief whether corrupt practices have or have not extensively prevailed at the said election.\n\"We have no reason to believe that the inquiry into the circumstances of the election has been rendered incomplete by the action of any of the parties to the said petition or that further inquiry as to whether corrupt practices have extensively prevailed is desirable.\"\nAylesworth K.C. for the appellant referred to the East Hastings Election Case[2]; Russell Election Case[3]; Bothwell Election Case[4]; Digby Election Case[5]; under the Acts in force prior to 1900, and to the 'North Simcoe Election Case[6]; and the London Election Case[7]; decided after the Election Act of 1901.\nLynch Staunton K.C. and Duff for the respondent. The Election Acts call for absolute secrecy of the ballot, which should be held in view in construing their provisions. Veale on Statutes, p. 140; Washington v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[8].\nThe ballots were clearly invalid and properly rejected. Pritchard v. Mayor of Bangor[9]; Bridport Election Petition[10].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is a plain case, as I view it, and, notwithstanding the able argument at bar by appellant's counsel, I unhesitatingly think that his appeal must be dismissed. His contentions are, virtually, that the statute does not mean what it says. When it decrees in so many words that all the ballots upon which there is any writing or marks by which the voter could be identified must be rejected it does not say, as the appellant would contend, that the deputy returning officer is authorized to count a ballot so marked simply because it is himself who has marked it. The principle of the Act, it must be conceded, requires absolute secrecy of the ballot for the protection of the voter; and that, in the public interest, as well against the deputy returning officer as against every one else.\nIt must be because, as a general rule, all ballots marked by a deputy returning officer are not to be counted, that it was enacted by the amendment of 1886 (as declaratory law 49 Vict. ch. 4, sec. 8) that, by exception, those the marking whereof by himself is specially provided for by the Act have to be counted.\nLe sous-officier-rapporteur (says the French version in clear terms) \u00e9cartera tous les bulletins qui porteront quelques mots \u00e9crits ou quelque marque ou indication autre que le numero \u00e9crit inscrit par le sous-officier-rapporteur dans les cas ci-dessus pr\u00e9vus qui pourraient faire reconna\u00eetre le votant.\nWhy would the statute enact by way of exception that those ballots falling within the class of cases specially provided for as to marking by the deputy returning officer shall not be rejected if all those marked by him not falling within that same class of cases were likewise not to be rejected. To enact that those the marking of which is authorized shall be counted was to enact, or taking it to be the law, that those the marking of which is not authorized shall not be counted.\nThat amendment of, 1886 declaring, ex abundanti cautel\u00e2, that votes legally marked by a deputy returning officer under the Act are not to be rejected cannot be construed as meaning that those he illegally marks are also not to be rejected. Then Parliament, by allowing the statute to remain as it is since 1886, must be taken to have tacitly acquiesced in the construction that has generally been put upon it by the courts, that any mark upon the ballot paper by which the voter could be identified, never mind by whom made, voids the vote.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J. (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014If any doubt could be entertained as to the meaning of the former statute, that doubt has been removed by the Dominion Controverted Elections Act of 1900, adding the two last lines to section 80. Section 96 cannot help the appellant; quite the reverse, for it evidently refers to the exceptional cases mentioned in section 80. Mr. Aylesworth has admitted that possibly, by means of the numbers on the back of the ballot, the voter could be identified, and that the end which Parliament intended to achieve, namely, the perfect secrecy of the ballot, would be defeated. It is perhaps to be deplored that the fate of an election should thus be left in the hands of dishonest or ignorant deputy returning officers, unfortunately too numerous. Parliament alone can remedy such a serious result, so contrary to the popular government of a free country.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nNESBITT J.\u2014I concur with the Chief Justice.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014This case turns upon the interpretation to be given to sub-sec. 2 of sec. 80 of the Dominion Elections Act, 1900. The end of sub-section 1 and the whole of section 2, are as follows:\n* * * he shall open the ballot box and proceed to count the number of votes given for each candidate, giving full opportunity to those present to examine each ballot.\n2. In counting the votes he shall reject all ballot papers which have not been supplied by the deputy returning officer, all those by which votes have been given for more candidates than are to be elected, and all those upon which there is any writing or mark by which the voter could be identified, other than the numbering by the deputy returning officer in the cases hereinbefore provided for.\nHas Parliament by this directed the deputy returning officer to count only such ballots as he may choose?\nThat seems to be the issue. For if we follow the respondent's reading of the golden rule of construction he invokes, then the officer can, before counting, destroy such ballots as he may desire should not be counted.\nThe court, it is said, in such an event can do nothing to relieve from what may have been an accident, or to defeat what may have been a fraud.\nThe election may be set aside. That is no efficient remedy. It may be exactly what the officer designed to bring about.\nThe innocent blunder here may find its counterpart in fraud hereafter. Either may happen. Either must defeat the purpose of the Act, if we listen to the pretention put forward that secrecy is the sole thing to be considered.\nTo maintain seriously the proposition that the main purpose and policy of the Act is to secure the secrecy of the ballot is to overlook what the Act is for.\nThe purpose of the Act is to give effect to the will of the people. The signification thereof by ballot is but a means to that end.\nThe interpretation we are asked here to adopt, must be adopted alike in the cases of fraud and accident as respondent's counsel properly conceded. That interpretation would sacrifice the object of the Act for the conservation of the manner of effecting its purpose.\nIs it possible that Parliament can ever have intended that?\nIt has been said for ages that a statute is to be expounded \"according to the intent of them that made it\"\nRules of construction are but means to realize that intent.\nThe rule appealed to is as follows:\nIn construing wills, and indeed statutes and all written instruments, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to, unless that would lead to some absurdity or some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument, in which case the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words may be modified so as to avoid that absurdity and inconsistency, and no further.\nIt would be hard to recognize the observance of this rule in the results that the respondent's contention leads to.\nIt would be observing the first part of the rule and discarding the rest.\nCould there be a greater absurdity than that the will of the people must be defeated by means of the machinery designed to give effect to it and a continuation of such results be rendered possible?\nIs not this sub-section just one of the cases within the exception in the rule? May not the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words be so modified as to avoid the absurdity and repugnance?\nDoes the rule not clearly indicate in the light of the facts we are to pass upon that such is the proper view to take?\nThe intention of Parliament would then be found rather than in any view that renders it necessary to make a travesty of such intention and declare the election void.\nDrastic measures may be needed to preserve the secrecy of the ballot, but that would not do it. The harm, if any, has been done, the possibility of betrayal by the officers and agents of the secrets they are bound by law (see sec. 96, sub-secs. 5, 6) to keep sacred still exists.\nWhy should we adopt any other remedy than that expressly given?\nA prosecution for breach of this statute is what Parliament has plainly indicated as all that it is intended should in this regard be given for such a purpose as the preservation of secrecy. Why above all should we adopt such a futile remedy as setting aside this election? Why should we confuse the two things? The secrecy of the ballot and the selecting power of the people as shewn by their votes that this enactment was intended to procure are quite distinct and, as I have said, are respectively means and purpose; and each has separate and distinct enactments for safeguarding it.\nIs it not much more consonant with reason to read the whole of this sub-section 2 as directory? Reading it so accords with these considerations I have pointed out.\nThat would give it such elasticity as would enable the court to set aside the election when the facts seemed to demand it so that justice might be done, and refrain from such a course when unnecessary within the provisions of section 152, the predecessor of which in identical words was relied upon in the Bothwell Election Case[11].\nBut whether the section is directory or mandatory and imperative its primary purpose is to guide this officer in counting ballots. Can it be conceived possible that it was ever meant to guide him to reject in regard to marks accidentally or improperly made by himself?\nHe was bound by every principle of law and ethics not to use the fruits of his own wrong to the detriment of others.\nWas it not only his duty to discard his own wrong, but also obliterate it as soon as seen, so that others should not be misled?\nHe has discarded it. He failed to obliterate it. He fell short thus in the discharge of his duty as declared by this court in the Bothwell Election Case(1).\nIn this way of looking at the case it is one that comes within the curative provision I have referred to.\nBut when we consider the purview of the Act is there any need of thus refining; perhaps over-refining?\nThe ballot was to protect the man from the master and defeat the briber's arts.\nIt was clear that if there could be a means of the man assuring the master or the purchased voter assuring his corrupter how the vote has been cast then the Act might be defeated. The purpose of the Act, as I have said, was to give effect to the will of the people and to limit the expression of such will to worthy freemen and reject that of the confessedly unworthy. To prevent this a direction was adopted by section 41 and schedule L., declaring that if the voter\nplaced any marks on the ballot paper by which he can afterwards be identified his vote will be void.\nIt is abundantly clear to my mind that this and this only was the kind of marking and the only marking that within the sub-section now under consideration was expected to occur, and which it was intended to prevent or deprive of success.\nIt is almost impossible to imagine that it was ever supposed by any one, that a sworn officer of the law, having accidentally or innocently made a mark, was a something likely to happen and needing such an absurd method of rectification or remedy.\nIt is surely repugnant, therefore, to the general purview of the statute to read this sub-section 2 in an absolute and narrow literal sense.\nMoreover, there are presumptions of law that have uniformly been held to be implied in the legislative use of general words to restrict their ordinary meaning so that manifest wrong and injustice will not result from giving them their widest sense.\nFor example, when a statute authorized in express words \"any or the nearest justice of the peace\" to try certain cases, it was held that such general words would not authorize a judge to try any such case out of the territorial limits of his own jurisdiction: See 1 Hawke P.C.C. 65, sec. 45; Re Peerless[12]; The King v. Inhabitants of Fylingdales[13].\nIt was also held that giving power to grant an injunction, in all cases in which the judge or court should consider it \"just and convenient\" did not extend the authority of the court beyond cases where there was an invasion of recognized and legal or equitable rights.\nIn Reg. v. Coaks[14] it was held that the law declaring that he having the majority of votes should be declared elected, was not to override the general law that those who knowingly should vote for one ineligible throw away their votes. This case has been criticized in some points but not in this, or overruled as far as I can see.\nThe statute which enacted that \"every conveyance\" in a particular form should be valid would not cure a defective title; Ward v. Scott[15]; Whidborne v. Ecclesiastical Commissioners[16]; Forbes v. Ecclesiastical Commissioners for England[17].\nThe 12 Car. II. ch. 17, which enacted that all persons presented to benefices in the time of the Commonwealth, and who should conform, as directed by the Act, should be confirmed therein \"notwithstanding any act or thing whatsoever,\" was held obviously not intended to apply to a person who had been simoniacally presented.\nThe Factors Act which enacts that any agent \"entrusted with the possession of goods\" shall be deemed their owner is confined by the general scope and object of the enactment to mercantile agents and transactions.\nRuther v. Harris[18] decided that a provision of forfeiture of \"fish taken by him and any net or moveable instrument used by him in taking the same\" operated even where no fish had been caught and that the net ineffectively used for the purpose was forfeited. The provision in the Railway and Canals Traffic Act imposing liability for loss \"occasioned by the neglect or default of such company or its servants\" was held in Shaw v. Great Western Railway Co.[19] not to cover theft by a servant of the company.\nIn The Queen v. Harrald[20], an Act declaring that wherever\nwords occur which import the masculine gender the same shall be held to include females for all purposes connected with and having reference to the right to vote in the election of councillors, etc.,\nwas held not to apply to married women.\nAnd when Baron Parke in Miller v. Salomons[21] had to interpret an Act requiring one to take and subscribe the oath of adjuration \"according to the form therein set down and prescribed\" he stated the rule of interpretation now appealed to here and departed from the literal meaning, and remarked that in case of absurdity, inconsistency or repugnance,\nwe may predicate that the words never could have been used by the framers of the law in such a sense.\nI think these illustrations are sufficient to shew that the modification I suggest, as required here by the purview of the Act, of the grammatical sense of the words in question are well within precedent and authority. See Maxwell, Hardcastle and Endlich if further illustrations be needed.\nThere is no decision binding this court to adopt such an interpretation of this sub-section as the respondent contends for. We have been pressed to accept dicta that appear in the Bothwell Election Case[22] as expressing the opinion of this court upon the question raised here. In that case the deputy returning officer, at No. 1 Sombra Poll, did just what the deputy returning officer is complained of doing in this case. But when he was counting the ballots he came to the conclusion that those which had written upon them the objectionable numbers ought not to have been so numbered, and he proceeded to obliterate the numbers, and did so in the presence of the agents of the parties to the election, and then counted the ballots as if nothing had been marked. What right had he to do this? What right if the sub-section in question is to be given such an absolute literal interpretation as asked for could he possibly have? The subsection speaks clearly and distinctly in relation to the appearance of the ballots when taken from the ballot box.\nIf the deputy returning officer had the right after the ballots were taken from the box thus to rectify his mistake surely all that is asked by the appellant here is simply an extension of the same procedure. The court is asked to ignore here what the officer there, as the court held, had properly obliterated. So far, therefore, from the Bothwell Election Case[23] being a decision in favour of the respondent I read it as in favour of the appellant's contention. What the appellant says is, that the words are not inflexible, and do not in law require an inflexible interpretation. And that the court seems expressly to have decided. It is true, that the late Mr. Justice Gwynne in that case dissented and his opinion is quite consistent with the interpretation contended for by the respondent here. The late Mr. Justice Henry also seems to have indicated that but for Jenkins v. Brecken[24] he might have been of the same mind, but joined the majority of the court. The late Chief Justice Ritchie said:\nIt seems to me that this in no way differs from the principle acted on in Jenkins v. Brecken[25], but is a much stronger case for the application of that principle, the only difference being the rectification of the error or irregularity by the officer at the close of the poll. The appellant's contention is that this rectification made a ballot, bad in the box, good out of the box, but this, though on the surface plausible, is, in my opinion, by no means a legitimate or accurate way of stating the case; if literally so, it is no more nor less in effect than was done in the Brecken Case (1). In what respect does the present case differ substantially from that of an officer inadvertently marking a ballot and giving it to a voter and before being used he discovers that he has improperly marked it, and then and there effectually expunges the mark and hands it to the voter? In such a case he immediately, before any harm is done, corrects his error. In the present case the officer, in the fair and legitimate discharge of his duty, innocently but irregularly marks a ballot; discovering his error at the very first moment it could be done, in the presence of the agents of the parties, he proceeds to undo what he had improperly done, and he accomplishes this in such a manner that the secrecy of the ballot is preserved, and also in such an effectual way that there is no possibility that any party could be injured thereby, and this, too, in the presence and without the slightest objection or protest on the part of the agents of the candidates.\nHe also said before this in regard to the question of secrecy having been preserved:\nAnd I may say if they had been seen by the deputy returning officer I should doubt whether even this would affect the question because the secrecy in such a case would be as much preserved by the oath of the deputy returning officer as in the case of the ballots he marks for illiterate voters.\nMr. Justice Strong, in his brief judgment concurring with the Chief Justice, says:\nI desire also to add that, by assenting to the grounds upon which the judgment proceeds, I do not mean to preclude myself from the right to consider in any future case in which the question may arise, whether any mark put on a ballot by mistake and in good faith by a deputy returning officer is to be held a ground for rejecting the ballot.\nThe late Mr. Justice Fournier, in his judgment, states the facts, follows much the same line of reasoning as the Chief Justice, and finds, as he believed, according to the principle of the judgment in Queen's (P.E.I.) Election Case; Jenkins v. Brecken[26] and of the then sec. 80, that was identical with the present sec. 152, to which I have adverted.\nI am, therefore, unable to assent to the proposition that the Bothwell Election Case[27] can in any way be relied upon to support the respondent's position here. And I do think that it is a most significant thing that so able and astute a lawyer as Mr. Justice Strong should have preserved, in the way he did, his right to declare, if he saw fit, the meaning of the then section. His intimation to my mind is plain.\nAs to the decisions upon the English Ballot Act, 1872, and the Election Act of Ontario, there is one observation to be made applicable to both. These Acts were framed upon an entirely different principle from the Dominion Elections Act, 1900. Under the former in both cases numbers had to be put upon the back of the ballots and so they were traceable. Scrutiny might be had, and incidentally to scrutiny, numbers such as were put upon the back here would facilitate the exposure of secrecy, supposed to be covered by the ballot. It would do more. It would facilitate, when secrecy was violated, the improper revelation to one bent upon what was intended to be kept secret.\nOn the other hand, the Act we are now considering in its whole scope prevents possibility of scrutiny. There is no chance of such a thing being successfully sought for. There is no reason in such an act to anticipate disclosures by means of the machinery put in operation necessary for a scrutiny.\nIn one way of looking at all this consideration of the two kinds of legislation it may be said that the necessity (in the case of this Act) for prohibition of anything tending to expose the ballot to identification needs to be construed more liberally than otherwise and given effect to with the utmost rigour. It may be said that the prohibition of scrutiny indicates an intention to make of secrecy the supreme guide for the interpretation of the Act.\nOn the other hand when there is no practical possibility of the numbers that are complained of being seen and thereby leading to identification of the voter there can be no necessity for the rigid interpretation, and it cannot be predicated of the legislation to be interpreted that it was supposed necessary at the expense of all else so to protect the voter. Whichever may be the proper inference, or whatever may be the proper reasoning to be drawn from a comparison of the English cases and the Ontario cases with this, I do not think, when we consider the difference in the policy of those Acts, upon which those decisions are respectively founded, that they can be held for our present purpose as of high authority.\nIn regard to the Ballot Act, 1872, I do not find in it any such curative provision as I have referred to as existing here, and relied upon in the Bothwell Election Case[28]. In both that Act and the Election Act of Ontario it is expressly provided, in addition to forbidding the counting of the ballot having unauthorized writing upon it by which the voter can be identified, that it shall be void. The Act in hand is one that by these different features and other minor details is so much differentiated from the Acts I have just referred to that its interpretation must be sought for upon consideration of its own purview, and cannot be aided much by considering entirely different legislation.\nWith every respect, I think in this case there has been entirely too much importance attached to the secrecy of the ballot and the risk of exposure and identification by means of the numbers wrongfully placed by the deputy returning officer. When is this to take place? I have pointed out that it cannot be through the means of the scrutiny. I think it cannot be by the means of the first count of the votes by the deputy returning officer or by means of the recount by the judge.\nI entirely agree on this point with the well-reasoned judgment of Judge Ardagh where he held in the North Simcoe Election Case, in 1904[29], that the deputy returning officer had no right to look at the poll book and compare it with the ballots. One has but to read the whole of sec. 80, sub-sec. 1, to see that it contained two distinct directions as to the work to be done by the deputy returning officer. One relates to the disposition to be made by him of the papers including ballots spoiled and unused and poll books and only then when he has completed that part of his work shall he open the ballot box and proceed as directed in the language I have quoted from the section. His simple duty at the next stage of the proceeding is to count ballots. He does not need to refer to the numbers on the poll book for identification in any way. When he sees his own numbering wrongfully put upon the ballots he is under no necessity in order to understand what that means to refer to any poll book. No one else has a right any more than he to refer to the poll book for that or any other purpose, after the total number of votes has been checked. No comparison of numbers on poll book and ballot paper can properly be made at any stage of the proceedings till a trial of a petition, and then only so far as to discover the nature of the impropriety to be investigated.\nThe counting the number of votes that appear on the poll book as having voted has all been accomplished before the count or recount of ballots is made.\nThe proceedings before the county judge are simply a repetition of what I have thus described as having been done by the deputy returning officer. I see no occasion for looking at or inspecting the poll books. The number of the ballots cast can be checked without any such reference and, with all respect, I think ought to be checked without any such reference.\nIf this all be right when is the terrible disaster to overtake the secrecy of the ballot? By what means is such a thing to be accomplished? One can conceive of resorting to methods to which the deputy returning officer might be a party, and, with his connivance, improper results might be obtained, but that as well as the improper use by the deputy returning officer of such numbering as done here can be dealt with when fraudulently done, and the fraudulent act defeated by such remedy as setting aside the election if need be, or by declaring the correct results. Fraud has to be reckoned with in every phase of human activity, has to be met by the strong arm of the law, and when the case, that rests upon fraud as the basis of the improper dealing that has led to such numbering of ballots as here complained of, arises, it must be dealt with by the way and in the spirit that the courts have to deal with fraud and wilful wrongdoing, both in election and in other cases.\nI dissent, with respect, from the opinions of those who attach such supreme importance to the secrecy of the ballot. And I have adverted thus to the subject to shew wherein I think it is in this connection of little moment. I may add also that, whilst the ballot no doubt protects the weak against the strong, it is but a very small fraction of the electorate who need and actually depend on such protection.\nThe great majority of freemen are proud to avow their opinions and openly declare outside the polling booth their preferences. When one reflects on this well-known fact and the exceptional nature of the case we have to deal with, I think it must be seen that far too much importance is attached to the secrecy that helps the few, and too little weight given to the wrong done the many. Such protection is bought at a price I am sure the legislature never intended to pay. We have in the judgment of the trial court appealed from the opinion of Sir William Meredith, concurred in by Mr. Justice Teetzel, that the interpretation which I have been arguing for would be the correct reading of the provision as it stood before the revision of the statutes in 1886. I quote the following from their opinion:\nReading the provision as to the rejection of ballot papers as it stood before the revision of the statutes in 1886, in connection with the directions for the guidance of electors in voting, no canon of construction would be violated, I think, by interpreting the words \"any writing or mark by which the voter could be identified\" as meaning any such writing or mark placed on the ballot paper as is mentioned in the directions, and therefore as extending only to those placed on it by the voter himself or by his connivance or with his consent.\nThis opinion, I think, should govern this case, for I do not think that the change made in the revision of 1886 makes any difference. I think the following remark made by Baron Martin in Miller v. Salomons[30] at page 531, might well be applied to the amendment in question:\nIt is quite notorious that Acts of Parliament are frequently made and that much more frequently sections are introduced to meet objections and set at rest doubts without much consideration as to whether they be really well founded or not.\nThe amendment consists in the addition of the words, \"other than the numbering by the deputy returning officer in the cases hereinbefore provided for,\" at the end of the sub-section in question.\nThis amendment seems to have come into the statutes simply in the process of revision in 1886 and in considering it, and what effect is to be given to it as a change of the law, if any, I think regard should be had to 49 Vict. ch. 4, sec. 8.\nI am, with great respect, unable to see how or why this change should make any difference in the interpretation. It would be necessary by the application of the principles I have sought to apply herein for the officer to adopt the same line of duty, and the court to avoid 5 the same absurdity and repugnance to the purview of the Act\nApplying those principles and the considerations that Chief Justice Meredith seems to think are properly to be had in view, the result would be the same. There had been an obvious oversight in not originally making the exception that these words provided, and all that seems to happen is that the Commissioners in the revision observing the oversight added these words. The amendment proceeds upon the presumption that the officer will have discharged his duty, will not have acted improperly, and that the proper interpretation of the section as it originally stood would be the correct one when thus added to.\nI think the appeal ought to be allowed, but inasmuch as the judgment appealed against was in accord with judicial opinions that might reasonably be followed, and that it might be said bound the court below, yet does not bind this court, I would not give costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

J.\nControverted elections\u2014Service of Petition\u2014Service out of jurisdiction\u2014Second service on agent\u2014Nova Scotia Election Court Rules.\nUnder the Dominion Elections Act service of an election petition cannot be made outside of Canada. Idington J. dissenting.\nBy rule 10 of the Nova Scotia rules under the Election Act, a candidate returned at an election may, by written notice deposited with the clerk of the court, appoint an attorney to act as his agent in case there should be a petition against him.\nHeld, than an agent so appointed is only authorized to act in proceedings subsequent to the service of the petition, and service of the petition itself on him is a nullity.\nAppeal from the judgment of Weatherbe C.J. allowing the preliminary objections to the petition against respondent which denied that the same had been served and dismissing said petition.\nBy order of a judge the election petition was served on respondent at Boston, Mass., and the latter thereupon appointed an agent under rule 10 of the Supreme Court Rules relating to controverted elections, which is as follows: Any person returned as a member may, at any time after he is returned, send or leave at the office of the clerk of the court a writing signed by him, or on his behalf, appointing a person entitled to practice as an attorney to act as his agent, in case there should be a petition against him, or stating that he intends to act for himself, and in either case giving an address, within the City of Halifax, at which notices may be left.\nA copy of the petition was afterwards served on such agent at Halifax after preliminary objections to the petition had been filed. By leave of a judge further objections were then filed, by which it was denied that the petition had ever been served, and on the hearing thereon the Chief Justice dismissed the petition for want of service.\nThe material sections of the Election Act and rules thereunder are set out in the judgment on this appeal.\nLovett and R. V. Sinclair for the appellant.\nRoscoe K.C. and Mellish K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The respondent having been returned at the general elections of 1904 as a duly elected member of the House of Commons for the County of King's, N.S., the appellant on the 12th December, 1904, presented a petition impugning the said return.\nAs the respondent was then in Boston an order was taken by the appellant, on the 16th, extending the time for service to the 23rd of January, 1905, inclusive, and on the same day, 16th December, an order was taken giving leave to effect service on the respondent personally at Boston.\nUnder these orders the respondent was served personally at Boston three days later, on the 19th of December. On the 23rd the respondent, under the rules, appointed one C. F. Pearson as his agent and attorney, notice whereof was given by said Pearson on the 24th, and on the same day the respondent filed preliminary objections against the petition.\nOn the 23rd of January following, the petitioner himself casting a doubt upon the service in Boston, a second service of the petition was made at Halifax on the said Pearson, as agent of the respondent. What became of the first preliminary objections filed on the 24th of December does not appear by the printed record. They are not now in question. On the 6th of April, upon leave, a second set of preliminary objections was filed by the respondent against the petition on the ground, amongst others, that the said petition had never been duly served upon him. By the judgment now appealed from these preliminary objections were maintained, and the petition dismissed, the learned judge holding the service in Boston bad because not authorized by statute, and the service on Pearson also bad because not previously authorized by the court or a judge. This judgment is, in my opinion, unassailable.\nAs to the service in Boston there is nothing in the statute that governs this case (54 & 55 Vict. ch. 20, sec. 8), or the rules of the court construed with that statute, as they must be, that authorizes a service abroad. And no such service can be legally made without clear statutory authority. Here the statute must be construed as authorizing exclusively, first, a personal service anywhere in Canada, if possible, and, secondly, if that is not possible, a service upon such other person or in such other manner in Canada as directed by the court or judge. As to the service upon respondent's agent at Halifax, it is invalid because not authorized by the court or a judge. Rule 20 of the Election Rules, N.S., enacts, it is true, that when a party against whom a petition is filed is not within the province, the petition shall be served in such manner as one of the judges shall direct, but the words \"in such manner\" must now be read as if followed by the words \"in Canada.\" The appellant argued that under rules 10 and 46 of the N.S. Election Rules, the service on respondent's agent at Halifax was valid.\nThose rules read as follows:\n10. Any person returned as a member may at any time after he is returned send or leave at the office of the clerk of the court a writing signed by him or on his behalf appointing a person entitled to practice as an attorney to act as his agent in case there should be a petition against him or stating that he intends to act for himself, and in either case giving an address within the City of Halifax at which notice may be left and in default of such writing being left within a week after service of the petition notices and proceedings may be given and served respectively, by posting up the same in the office of the clerk of the court.\nThis is a reproduction of rule 10 of the English and Ontario rules. Rule 46 says that:\nAn agent employed for the petitioner or respondent shall forthwith leave written notice at the office of the clerk of the court of his appointment to act as such agent, and services of notices and proceedings upon such agent shall be sufficient for all purposes. (59 of the English rules and 49 of Ontario rules.)\nAt first I thought that the appellant's contention was well founded, and that these rules authorized the service of the petition on the agent, but after further consideration I have come to the contrary conclusion.\nIn England, though the two preceding rules referred to are enacted in the same terms, they could not have been intended to have any application to the service of the petition itself, since rule 14 specially adds that where the respondent has named an agent, the service of an election petition may be by delivery of it to the agent.\nRule 14 in Ontario is in the same sense.\nNow when, in drafting their rules, the judges in Nova Scotia, who had before them the English rules, which in many instances they adopted textually, deliberately left out this last one, the legal inference is that they did not intend to authorize the service of the petition itself on the agent, but simply the service of the proceedings subsequent to an effective and valid service of the petition.\nThen by the statute of 1891, subsequent to these rules, when the service cannot be made upon the respondent himself in Canada, it can only be made upon such other person as directed by the court or a judge. Here there was no order permitting service on respondent's agent. The service upon him was, therefore, void and ineffective.\nThe appellant further argued that the respondent had waived any objection he might have had against the service by appointing an agent and filing preliminary objections, and taking proceedings thereupon. This contention cannot be supported; Montmagny Election Case[1].\nThe preliminary objections alleging no service could not with any fairness be construed as admitting a legal service. The respondent here, it is true, filed a cross-petition, arid such a proceeding could be taken perhaps only after service, but he carefully, in express terms, filed this cross-petition \"without waiving any objection to the service of said petition.\"\nIt may be that the cross-petition filed on the 30th of December, 1904, is irregularly on the record; this we do not have to decide. But it cannot have the effect contended for by the appellant of an unconditional admission by respondent of a legal service of the petition. There is nothing inconsistent in the respondent saying \"a de facto service, or an attempted service, or what the appellant pretends to be a service has been made on me, or on some one else or somewhere for me, but I impeach the validity of that service, and appear for the exclusive purpose of asking the court to declare it illegal, ineffective and null.\"\nAnother point raised by the appellant is as to his allegations of corrupt practices by the respondent at a previous election which were struck out by the judge. As the petition must stand dismissed for want of service we need not adjudicate upon this point. I may as well remark, however, that no appeal would lie from the dismissal of the paragraphs of the petition relating thereto (23 to 34), if all the other preliminary objections had been dismissed, as the judgment thereupon would not in that case have put an end to the petition, but solely to the said paragraphs thereof; sec. 50, ch. 9, R.S.C\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The service of the election petition in Boston is bad, because it was not made in Canada; 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 20, sec. 8. The second service in Halifax is also bad, because it was made not upon a general agent authorized by the respondent to accept service of an election petition and all papers connected with the same, but upon an attorney or agent authorized to represent him in a special cause already instituted. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I have carefully read and considered all the cases cited by the learned counsel who argued this appeal. I concur in and adopt the rule laid down by the Court of Appeal in In re Bus field[2], at page 132, by Cotton L.J., as the result of all the cases, in the following words:\nWhere anything like jurisdiction over the person has been sought to be exercised leave to serve abroad in cases not coming within the terms of Order XI., has been refused as in Re Maugham[3], and in Re Mewburn's Settled Estates[4]. In my opinion the principle laid down by the late Master of the Rolls is correct, that the court has no power to order service out of the jurisdiction except where it is authorized by statute to do so.\nThen does the Controverted Elections Act authorize such service out of the jurisdiction? The jurisdiction of the Election Court, as already determined by this court in the Queen's and Prince Election Case[5], so far as service of the petition is concerned, extends all over Canada. After that case was decided Parliament amended the 10th section of the Controverted Elections Act by 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 20, which in its 8th section declares that notice of the presentation of an election petition, etc., may be served on the respondent personally \"at any place within Canada.\" The section goes on to declare that if such personal service cannot be made then service may be effected.\nupon such other person or in such other manner as the court or judge on the application of the petitioner directs.\nIt is clear to my mind that this substituted service, if made on any other person than the respondent, was not authorized to be so. made out of Canada, and it is equally clear to me that the \"other manner\" of service means some other manner within Canada, and does not alter and was not intended to alter the place where legal service could be effected. In other words substituted service alike with personal service must be within Canada, the statute not having either expressly or by necessary implication authorized it to be made out of the jurisdiction of the court.\nThe result is that the personal service effected on the respondent in Boston was not a good service, and I fully agree with all my colleagues that the subsequent service without any special order therefore made upon the respondent's agent appointed for the purpose of taking exception to the personal service made upon him in Boston by preliminary objection was not a good service. The rules of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia do not cover any such case, and the English rule and the Ontario rule, under which such service may be effected, seem to be designedly omitted. At any rate these later rules are not in the Nova Scotia rules.\nThe appeal, therefore, should be dismissed with costs.\nNESBITT J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014I think this appeal must be determined by the interpretation to be given to section 10 of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act as amended by 54 & 55 Vict. sec. 8, whereby it is made to read as follows:\nNotice of the presentation of a petition under this Act, and of the security, accompanied with a copy of the petition, shall, within ten days after the day on which the petition has been presented, or within the prescribed time, or within such longer time as the court, or any judge thereof, under special circumstances of difficulty in effecting service, allows, be served on the respondent or respondents at any place within Canada. If service cannot be effected on the respondent or respondents personally within the time granted by the court or judge, then it may be effected upon such other person, or in such other manner, as the court or judge, on the application of the petitioner, directs.\nObviously the first part of this section contemplates that notice of a petition must be served within Canada.\nIt is equally clear to my mind that service within Canada was intended to be in all cases a personal service if possible.\nThen the second part of the section provides for service, when that cannot be so effected on the respondent,\nupon such other person, or in such other manner as the court or a judge on the application of a petitioner directs.\nWhen the service which the first part of the section provides for, that is the personal service within Canada, cannot be accomplished, I think the alternative proposition of the section, providing for all else in the way of service, commits the entire subject matter of service to the discretion of the court or judge to dispose of on the application of the petitioner. Power is given to direct service upon any other person than the respondent. It might be directed to be made upon any one named. Any person in the same association or representing the same party, or in some way from identity of interest likely to defend respondent's seat might well have been named, but failing that or the adoption of such plan of action, on whom can it be served?\nThe judge or court have committed to them, I think, in the widest possible sense the power to direct service on another person or by substitution in any way that the words \"or in such other manner\" are capable of authorizing to be done. Does that extend to a service beyond the jurisdiction? Would it have been improper for the judge who made the order in this case to have directed only that notice and a copy of the petition should be mailed (say at Halifax) to the respondent at Boston and order that such should be service?\nWhen the judge knew that the respondent was sojourning at a place so near to his home as Boston, or if he had been even nearer, would he have discharged his duty properly by directing that the petition, as has been suggested, might be posted up with notice in the office where it was filed as a mode of service, and yet have refrained from directing a communication thereof by mail or otherwise to the respondent, simply because respondent happened to be beyond the boundary line?\nCan it be said that a judge would have the discretion to direct the most obscure method of service, and that he must abstain from daring to direct transmission even for a few feet beyond the boundary line of Canada, of the notice of the presentation and copy of petition?\nThe whole difficulty, it is suggested, arises from the necessity for the observance of a highly technical rule requiring foreign service to be effected only by virtue of a statute.\nOne thing to be observed and borne in mind is that this proceeding is not one begun by way of a common law writ which never could have run into, or by any such semblance thereof as service abroad be permitted to run into, a foreign country.\nThe law permitting that to be done must be by or founded upon a statute.\nIt is likewise to be borne in mind that despite such rigid rule of the common law the practice of the Court of Chancery grew up whereby proceedings began by bill, and the invitation to answer was served abroad by means of a subpoena. It is said that might go for nothing. As to relief to be got against the person of the defendant it obviously must go for nothing, yet such service abroad seems to have been usual.\nSide by side with these classes of cases which illustrate distinctly different growths of law the practice of service abroad, of notice in some form or other, of proceedings, in relation to things over which the court had a jurisdiction, grew. The curious may follow the inquiry in Daniell's Chancery Practice and other books wherein interpleader, for example, is shewn to have been one where the court first had required to be satisfied of such notice abroad, then proceeded to exercise, if the party abroad disregarded the notice, such jurisdiction as would give to those invoking the power of the court a remedy and protection in regard to their property within the jurisdiction which would have the effect of forever barring the right of him who happened to be abroad.\nI am not concerned to follow this learning further than to shew that there was not, even long ago, an inflexible rule of law that was of such universal application, that every statute creating a new jurisdiction such as these election courts, must be held to have necessarily had implied in their constitution a limitation of power forbidding the use (unless most explicit, express language gave it recognition) of notice to be communicated to a party in a foreign country, as of any force or effect whatsoever.\nIs there such an inflexible rule of law requiring us to place such a restricted meaning upon the comprehensive and the plain words in question?\nI rather think there is not now any such principle of law by which we must so interpret the words now under consideration, but on the contrary thereof that we must interpret the statute in the light of reason and daily practise and give to the words \"such other manner\" their widest signification.\nIf we look at the history of foreign service as outlined in Piggott on Service out of Jurisdiction, or for my present purpose concisely set forth in the judgment of Lord Chancellor Chelmsford in Drummond v. Drummond[6], and we find that the authority upon which the courts have acted, in making rules under and by virtue of which foreign service has become almost a universal form of procedure, at first rested upon implied rather than express power, we will be better able to appreciate the importance of not confining the powers of the court or judge under the second part of the section I am now considering within too narrow limits.\nThe power upon which at that time such general jurisdiction rested is well put in the judgment I am referring to thus:\nBut one of the Acts in pursuance of which these orders are made is the 3 & 4 Vict. ch. 94., which is of much more extensive operation. It empowers orders to be made with respect to the process, pleadings and course of proceeding in the Court of Chancery, not only in certain specified particulars but also in general and comprehensive terms. Amongst others, power is given to make alterations \"generally in the form and mode of proceeding to obtain relief and in the general practice of the court in relation thereto.\" These words seem to me to be sufficiently large to authorize rules to be made upon service to parties anywhere out of the jurisdiction, without which, in many cases, relief would not be attainable.\nCan it be said that the words quoted\ngenerally in the form and mode of procedure to obtain relief and in the general practice of the court in relation thereto\nare any more definite or imply in any more definite way that foreign service may be provided for than the words \"in such other manner as the court or judge,\" etc., directs service to be had? Yet in Drummond v. Drummond[7] Lord Chancellor Chelmsford evidently had the opinion that these words he quoted were sufficient authority for providing by general rules for service abroad.\nIt is unnecessary to say more on this than point out that the expression which Lord Chelmsford quotes was not used in relation to service at all, but the words we have to interpret expressly relate to service.\nYet the rules committee, constituted of the most eminent lawyers of that day, felt authorized thereby to expressly provide for foreign service.\nTrue such had to be submitted to Parliament before coming into force.\nI think, however, if foreign service was then so much beyond legal ken, or habit of thought, as the argument here would indicate, the judges would have refrained from submitting, as they did, by virtue of such authority, rules (which would be in light of that argument of such an invasive character), providing for it.\nWhen the judges of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia enacted rules they had only general, comprehensive words empowering them to make such rules of court\nfor the effectual execution of this Act and of the intention and object thereof and the regulation of the practice and procedure and costs with respect to election petitions and the trial thereof and the certifying and reporting them.\nThey then, by Rule 20, provided as follows:\nWhen the party against whom any petition is filed is not within the Province of Nova Scotia the petition and the accompanying document shall be served in such manner as one of the judges shall direct.\nWhen a service was made in Ottawa of a petition filed in Nova Scotia, against the member representing one of the ridings in that province, without deciding the question of the extent of the authority given by the rule, this court held that the service was good and at the same time the late Chief Justice Ritchie remarked[8]:\nI throw out of consideration altogether in this case the point raised as to the power of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to make rules in relation to the service of the presentation of the petition when the respondent is out of the province and jurisdiction of the court in which the petition is filed. If I was called on to express an opinion at the moment I would, as at present advised, think the court possessed such power.\nMost of the other judges seem to have been impressed with the order for extending time being one of discretion, and the service having been made at Ottawa, seems to have been treated as if good though beyond the jurisdiction of the province. This was before the Act was amended so as to make it clear that personal service within Canada would be sufficient.\nThis seems to me, when we look at the original section 10, which it interprets, to differ in spirit from that mode of interpretation that we are now asked to apply to the amended one in regard to the principle of extra territorial service.\nIt makes the jurisdiction of the court in regard to the directing of such service as within the purpose of the Act as it then stood.\nThe amendment nowise affects the spirit in which this mode of interpretation of the Shelburne-Queen's Election Case[9] should be applied to the second part of the amended section. If we adopt the same ideal of interpretation and do not feel hampered by practice or mode of interpretation that restricts service to mean anything but foreign service, we are at liberty to interpret this second part of the section in the same spirit in which the first part was interpreted in that case.\nIt would be in accord with the spirit of modern legislation throughout the Dominion, and especially with the spirit of the special legislation of Nova Scotia in regard to the rules of practice for the local courts providing for service of writs of summons, or notice thereof, of notice of originating summons or petition, as the case may be, within the usual range of subjects such rules are made applicable to.\nIf the words I refer to are capable of authorizing the judges to make a general rule of practice going the length of providing for foreign service, then, I think, in default of the rule, the language enables in each specific case the court or a judge on the application of a petitioner to make such order as was made here.\nThe case of the Credits Gerundeuse Ltd. v. Van Weede[10] would seem very much in point.\nIt was an application for leave to serve a copy of an interpleader summons obtained under Order 57 out of the jurisdiction, and the application was granted. The court observed that they did not assert any present jurisdiction over Jordi or propose to compel him to submit to its process, but merely give him notice of the proceedings which were being taken.\nJordi had commenced action in the court claiming the goods or their value, but he was beyond the jurisdiction of the court. The order did not rest upon any special legislation, but upon a long line of authorities, such as I have intimated above in regard to interpleader and other matters. I think the claim against the respondent is very much as was said by Sir Henry Strong in a somewhat similar case,\nthat these petitions are not personal actions, but more properly actions in rem.\nAll these considerations and such authority must not be lost sight of when we come to interpret the authority that is given by virtue of the words\nor in such other manner * * * as the court or judge may direct.\nI think the principles laid down by Lord Justice Bowen in Re King's Trade Mark[11] should be observed in the construction of this and any similar statute.\nHis exposition of the law therein seems amply to cover this or any other case. Amongst other things he says:\nIf the court at home has jurisdiction over the person or the thing, then the question whether sufficient notice has been given to anybody who is interested in the way in which the court exercises that jurisdiction, is a matter of municipal procedure\u2014municipal procedure to be regulated by statute, or by rules of court, where the court is empowered to make rules, but if there is no statute and no rules of court, a procedure which is to be judged of by the light of natural justice. In the last mentioned case the question of the validity of the notice is a question of procedure. It is not a question of jurisdiction.\nI think these words are applicable to this case when considering the meaning to be attached to the words we have to give effect to.\nAs to the application of words \"other manner\" see in Jackson v. Rainford Coal Co.[12] remarks of Chitty J. The West Algoma Election Case[13] would seem, as well as these other considerations and decisions, to uphold the conclusion I have arrived at, that it was entirely within the discretion of the judge who made the order for personal service in Boston, to do so or not and that with the exercise of that discretion we have no right to interfere.\nI may add that I would not if I could, for the order seems to me to be in accordance with reason and common sense as well as natural justice.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John A.

Subsequently, respondent having return to Canada, another copy was served on him at Ottawa within the time for service as extended by a judge under the Elections Act. Preliminary objections to the petition were filed, in some of which the respondent claimed that he had never been served as required by law. These objections were allowed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, who held that the service in London was void, but that it prevented a second service, and he dismissed the petition.\nLovett and R. V. Sinclair for the appellant.\nRoscoe K.C. and Mellish K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia dismissing, upon preliminary objections as to the service thereof on the respondent, the appellant's petition against the return of the respondent as member of the House of Commons for the electoral district of Shelburne and Queen's, N.S., at the general elections of 1904.\nThe said petition was presented in due time under the statute on the 12th of December, 1904. Before it could be served the respondent had left for Europe. On the 16th of December an order was taken extending the time for service to the 10th of February, 1905. On the same day an order, was taken giving leave to effect service on the respondent in Austria or in England. On the 3rd day of February, 1905, the respondent was served at London, in England. On the same day an order was taken extending the time for service to the 25th of March, 1905, and on the 28th day of February, the respondent having returned to Canada, service was made upon him personally at Ottawa. On the 6th day of March (the 5th being a Sunday), within five days of the service upon him at Ottawa, the respondent appeared by attorney and filed the preliminary objections now in question, having taken no notice of the service upon him in England. The judgment a quo dismissed the petition on the ground: 1st. That the service in England was bad because not authorized by the statute. 2ndly. That the service at Ottawa was also bad because a first service had been made or attempted to be made in England.\nWith deference, there is, in my opinion, error in that judgment upon the second point, and I would allow the appeal upon the ground that the service at Ottawa was a perfectly good and valid one.\nThe respondent has to admit that, but for the previous attempted service in England, the validity of that service at Ottawa could not be questioned under the provisions of the statute 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 20, sec. 8; Queen's and Prince (P.E.I.) Election Case[1]. Now, as held by the court below, that service in England was clearly unlawful; the statute does not authorize a service out of Canada and, without a direct authorization, such a service is void. Compare Williams v. The Mayor of Tenby[2]. And that being so, the appellant had a perfect right to effect a personal service at Ottawa within the extended delay.\nA defective previous service cannot, as the respondent would contend, invalidate a subsequent service made in conformity with the statute; Glengarry Election Case[3]. The respondent, who rightly insists that the service in England was a nullity de non esse, having no force and effect whatever, and treated it with contempt, would now argue that it has the effect of nullifying the service at Ottawa. I fail to see upon what ground that contention can be supported.\nAnother ground of appeal taken by the appellant is as to the striking out of his petition by the judgment the allegations of corrupt practices by the respondent at the previous election of 1900, and in allowing No. 16 of the respondent's preliminary objections. As to this part of the judgment no appeal lies under sec 50, ch. 9, R.S.O., as the allowance of this paragraph of the preliminary objections would not alone have put an end to the petition. Compare Mcintosh v. The Queen[4]. So that paragraphs 23 to 34 of the petition remain struck out.\nThe appellant has argued that, by appearing and filing preliminary objections, the respondent had waived his right to complain of the irregularities or deficiencies of the service. Though it is unnecessary to determine the point, in the view we take of the merits of the preliminary objections, yet it is not inexpedient to remark that the decision in the Montmagny Election Case[5] does not support that contention.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs and the preliminary objections dismissed with costs.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The notice of the election petition served upon the respondent in London, England, was contrary to 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 20, sec. 8, and is null and void. But the service made personally upon him in the City of Ottawa within the prescribed time was valid. There is no law and no authority for holding that a process of law cannot be served a second time, when, as in this instance, the first service was bad. The service may even be validly made twice or thrice; such a course would involve only a question of costs. The appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014For the reasons given by me in the case of King's (N.S.) Election Case; Parker v. Borden[6], just decided, I am of opinion that the service upon the appellant outside of Canada of the notice of the presentation of the petition in this case was not a good service.\nI concur, however, with all my colleagues in holding that the personal service subsequently effected upon the appellant was a good service, being in conformity with the statute, and not being in any way affected by the previous invalid service. This latter service was made in Canada and within the time therefor properly extended by the proper authority. The appeal should be allowed with costs.\nNESBITT J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nIDINGTON J. concurred in the result but not in the reasons.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John A.

JUSTICE GRAHAM.\nControverted election\u2014Preliminary objection\u2014Status of petitioner\u2014Corrupt acts\u2014Evidence\u2014Dominion Elections Act, 1900, sec. 113.\nSection 113 of the Dominion Election Act, 1900, provides that any person hiring a conveyance for a candidate at an election, or his agent, for the purpose of conveying any voter to or from a polling place shall, ipso facto, be disqualified from voting at such election.\nHeld, that the right of an elector to present a petition against the return of a candidate at an election may be. questioned, by preliminary objection, on the ground that he is disqualified under the above section and that on the hearing of the preliminary objection evidence may be given of the corrupt act which caused such disqualification. Beauharnois Election Case, [31 Can. S.C.R. 447] distinguished.\nHeld, also, that though, unless the commission of the corrupt act charged is admitted, it must be judicially established, such admission or judicial determination does not take effect merely from the. time at which it is made but relates back to the commission of the act.\nAppeal from the judgment in each case of Mr. Justice Graham, who dismissed the preliminary objections filed by the respective respondents to the election petitions.\nTo each of the three election petitions the respondent filed preliminary objections, one of which, No. 10, alleged that the petitioner had been guilty during the election of the offence mentioned in section 113 of the Dominion Elections Act, 1900, and was therefore disqualified from voting at said election, and consequently from petitioning against the return of the candidate elected thereat. The trial judge dismissed all the preliminary objections, holding that he had no power to receive evidence of the corrupt acts charged by the tenth. The respondents to the petition appealed from such decision.\nOn the hearing of the appeal an objection was taken to the jurisdiction of the court, but it was ruled that if the evidence had been received and the charges sustained, that would have put an end to the petitions, thus giving the court jurisdiction. Roscoe K.C. and Hellish K.C. for the appellants referred to the North Victoria Election Case[1]; North Simcoe Election Case[2]; Dufferin Election Case[3].\nLovett and R. V. Sinclair for the respondents cited the West Assiniboia Election Case[4]; Marquette Election Case[5].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I am of opinion that these appeals from the judgment in each case dismissing the tenth preliminary objection should be allowed with costs.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The principal, and, in fact, the only question involved in this appeal is whether or not evidence should be received of alleged corrupt practices by the petitioner at the election in question. The trial judge decided that such evidence could not be received. If the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, ch. 9, sec. 5, of the Revised Statutes of Canada, had not been altered by subsequent legislation, it seems to me that we would be almost bound to adopt the conclusion Mr. Justice Graham arrived at, supported as it is by eminent judicial authorities in this country. The point came before this court in The Beauharnois Election Case[6] but was not decided, the majority of the court holding simply that there was no evidence to support the charge of corrupt practices made against the petitioner. Now we have to face the difficulty which presents itself almost in the form of a demurrer to the preliminary objections of the respondent. It is contended by him that both under the New Franchise Act of 1898, 61 Vict. ch. 14, sees. 4(d) and 5, and the Dominion Elections Act, 1900, 63 & 64 Vict, ch. 12, secs. 3(a) and (d), a person inscribed on the voters' list, guilty of corrupt practices, cannot vote and cannot maintain a petition against the return. Then section 64, sub-sec. 3, of the same Act provides:\nIf the elector's name is found on the list of voters for the polling division of the polling station he shall, subject to the provisions hereinafter contained, be entitled to vote.\nFurther on come several sections providing for the disqualification of voters guilty of corrupt practices, especially section 113, about the hiring of teams for the conveyance of voters to the poll, which, ipso facto, disqualifies the voter from voting at such election. This section is in these words:\n113. The hiring or promising to pay or paying for any horse, team, carriage, cab or other vehicle by any candidate or by any person on his behalf, to convey any voter or voters to or from the poll, or to or from the neighbourhood thereof, at any election, or the payment, by any candidate or by any person on his behalf, of the travelling or other expenses of any voter, in going to or returning from any election, are unlawful acts; and every candidate or other person so offending shall forfeit the sum of one hundred dollars to any person who sues therefor; and any voter hiring any horse, cab, cart, waggon, sleigh, carriage or other conveyance for any candidate, or for any agent of a candidate, for the purpose of conveying any voter or voters to or from the polling place or places, shall, ipso facto, be disqualified from voting at such election, and shall, for every such offence, forfeit the sum of one hundred dollars to any person who sues therefor.\nI quite agree with Mr. Justice Graham, quoting with approbation the language of Baron Martin in the Norwich Election Case[7], that even in the case of hiring teams, a judgment declaring the voter guilty of the act is necessary, unless, perhaps, he confesses, but the judgment or confession will have a retroactive effect. The charge may be made in any proceeding relating to the trial of an election petition, by way of preliminary objection or petition for disqualification as well as by an independent action. The inquiry must, however, be limited to the hiring of teams under section 113, for no other clause uses the same language. We have nothing to do with the reason which induced Parliament to impose this exceptional severity, but it is obvious. The hiring of teams for polling day is, perhaps, the most common and effecting corrupt practice at elections, and, apparently, the least objectionable, morally, in so far as the voter is concerned.\nThe question, as put by the learned judge, is, perhaps, too general; it may be allowed as an introduction to the specific offence. In my humble opinion, the voter may have committed all the corrupt practices prohibited by the statute and yet be a qualified petitioner, if he has not been guilty of the offence defined in section 113.\nClause 129 provides for the punishment of all corrupt practices, and, undoubtedly, comprises the hiring of teams prohibited by section 113, which, by section 120, is declared to be a corrupt practice; but the effect of the various unlawful acts or corrupt practices is not the same. Under section 129 it is in futuro only, but under section 113 it goes back to the date of the commission of the act, at least to the polling day. The voter hiring any conveyance, whether his own or any other, for the purpose of conveying any voter to or from any polling place, is ipso facto disqualified from voting at such election, and, consequently, from being a petitioner in an election petition.\nThe result may not serve public interest. I quite agree with the late Chief Justice Richards that the importance to the public of determining whether the petitioner's hands are clean is insignificant compared to that of being satisfied that the respondent has not obtained the seat illegally. But the remedy rests, not with the courts, but with Parliament. In such a case as in the scandalous, so-called, \"sawing-off,\" the intervention of a new petitioner ought to be provided for within a certain delay.\nI believe the appeal in each case should be allowed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014These three appeals from the judgments of Mr. Justice Graham dismissing preliminary objections to the election petitions filed against the several respondents involve practically the same points, and may be consequently disposed of together.\nThe objections were: (1) That the petitioners had been guilty of bribery at the elections as defined by the 108th section of the Dominion Elections Act, 1900, and, therefore, had no right to vote; and (2) That they had hired conveyances to carry voters to the polls in violation of section 113 of the said Act, and were, by such act, expressly disqualified.\nIn dismissing both objections the learned judge expressed himself as being concluded by the Beauharnois Election Case[8]. The learned judge, however, entirely misapprehended that decision. The head-note of the report correctly states the decision, which was that\nas corrupt practices had not been proved the question as to the effect of the statutes did not arise.\nIt is true that Mr. Justice Gwynne expressed himself to the effect stated by Mr. Justice Graham, but his statements were purely obiter and not necessary for the decision of the case while the remaining five members of the court studiously avoided expressing any opinion on the points raised by him, and the then, and also the present, Chief Justice, who delivered reasoned judgments, explicitly stated the grounds of their judgments to be the absence of any evidence of corrupt practices.\nWith respect to the other authorities cited by the learned judge, I have read them all with great care, but cannot say that they are of much assistance in determining the points in question on these appeals.\nThese points must be determined by the language of the Dominion Elections Act, 1900, and the Controverted Elections Act, the former of which was not in force, in its present form, when the decisions referred to by the. learned judge were rendered.\nThe Controverted Elections Act gives the right to present an election petition exclusively to: (1) \"A person who has a right to vote\" at the elections to which the petition relates, or; (2) to a candidate at such election.\nThe questions raised by way of preliminary objections in this case were to the status of the petitioners, alleging that they were not persons entitled to vote at the respective elections because of their having been guilty of bribery and corruption within the 108th section of the Dominion Elections Act, or of unlawful acts within the 113th section.\nThe 12th section of the Controverted Elections Act provides for the presentation of preliminary objections to the petition and for their disposal in a \"summary manner.\"\nThe proviso of the 5th section of that Act, defining who may be a petitioner, declares that nothing in the Act should prevent objections under section 12\nto any further proceeding on the petition by reason of the ineligibility or the disqualification of the petitioner.\nThe proper time and way, therefore, to raise the objection to the petitioner's status was at and by the preliminary objections, and the sole questions to be determined are whether petitioners, if proved to have been guilty of bribery and corruption, within the meaning of the 108th section, or of unlawful acts within the 113th section, were still persons entitled to vote at the election, and, therefore, entitled to petition.\nTurning to the Dominion Elections Act, 1900, I find in the 7th section three classes of persons declared disqualified and incompetent to vote: First, judges of the courts; 2ndly, persons disqualified for corrupt practices under sections 126 and 129 of that Act and; 3rdly, persons disfranchised for taking bribes under chapter 14 of the statutes of 1894. The next section, the 8th, then goes on to disqualify and declare incompetent to vote, certain officials and persons acting in connection with the election for pay or reward.\nThen comes an entirely new section, 9, which reads:\nEvery person guilty at an election of the unlawful act mentioned in section 113 is disqualified from voting at such election.\nI am of the opinion that, without doing violence to the clear language of this section, I cannot hold either that a person so guilty is not disqualified from voting or that he is \"a person who had the right to vote at the election,\" and so a person entitled, under the words of the Controverted Elections Act, to file a petition. Turning to the 113th section itself, I find the intention of Parliament emphasized by the repetition of the disqualification of the voter in the following language:\nAny voter hiring a horse, cab, cart, waggon, sleigh, carriage or other conveyance for any candidate for the purpose of conveying any voter or voters to or from the polling place or places shall, ipso facto, be disqualified from voting at such election.\nNo language could be clearer or more explicit than this, and, when coupled with the new clause 9, which Parliament added to the disqualifying clauses in the revision of the Elections Act, in 1900, places the question, for me, beyond any doubt.\nAn impression seemed to prevail at the argument that the official list of voters was conclusive of the right of a man to vote. If his name was found there, his right to vote existed. If it was not found such right did not exist. Any such impression is, obviously, inaccurate.\nIn one, at least, of the provinces, there are no voters' lists at all, and no such test is applicable there.\nMany classes of persons whose names have been omitted from the lists in consequence of some provisions of the local law, are, nevertheless, entitled, under the 6th section of the Franchise Act, 1898, to vote at the place where, but for such omission, they would have been entitled to vote, on their taking the prescribed form of oath.\nOthers, whose names are on the list, but who are at the time of the election, either persons in a gaol for a criminal offence, or confined in a lunatic asylum or a poorhouse or other similar institution, are disqualified and incompetent.\nSo the question, in all cases, comes back to that of actual competency, and is one of fact to be determined on preliminary objection to the petition and by no means concluded by the production of the list of voters.\nI cannot draw any distinction between any of the enumerated classes of disqualified persons I have mentioned and those offenders against the 113th section of the Act who, by the words of the statute are disqualified and rendered incompetent by the very commission of the offence.\nThose voters who are charged with having committed generally the offences of bribery or corruption, within the definitions of those offences in the 108th section of the Act, seem to stand in a different position. Their case is governed by the 7th section of the Act which disqualifies\npersons disfranchised for corrupt practices under sections 126 and 129 of this Act.\nThese words, obviously, relate to those persons who, under the words of these two sections, have been \"found guilty\" and \"after they have had an opportunity of being heard.\"\nTheir disqualification covers a long period of years, and is not confined to the election at which they have committed the offence.\nThey cannot, therefore, be said to be \"disqualified\" until they have been \"found guilty after they have had an opportunity of being heard.\" The disfranchisement is not made to operate from the commission of the offence, but from their conviction, after trial.\nI am not concerned with the distinction Parliament has drawn between the two classes of offenders, or for the reasons which prompted the distinction. I find it in the Act, and my duty is to give effect to it. If Parliament determines to put both classes of offenders upon the same footing, as regards election petitions, a very few will suffice to do so.\nThese appeals must, therefore, each and all, be allowed with costs so far as the judgment and rulings of the learned judge went, disallowing the 10th preliminary objections and excluding evidence of petitioners' guilt under the 113th section of the Dominion Elections Act, 1900.\nOn the other ground, of the exclusion of evidence tending to shew that the petitioners were guilty of bribery or corruption generally, as defined by the 108th section of the Act, I think the rulings of the learned judge were correct, and that the preliminary objections were properly disallowed.\nWith respect to the jurisdiction of the court to hear the appeal, we disposed of that upon the argument, being all of the opinion that we had jurisdiction, the preliminary objections being of a character which, if they had been allowed, \"would have been final and conclusive, and have put an end to the petition.\"\nNESBITT J.\u2014I concur with the judgment of Mr. Justice Davies.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The first-mentioned case was argued and the other two agreed by counsel to stand upon the same argument with attention being called to the slight variations that obtained in each that might in certain events differentiate it from the first case.\nIn the view I take they may be disposed of together. The question raised is whether or not the status of the petitioner can be attacked by reason of any breach of the Dominion Elections Act, 1900, committed by him, at or during or immediately preceding, the election, and, thus, if he be found guilty of such breach, the petition may be dismissed.\nIt has been held in the court below that the respondent cannot, in such a case, take any such objection to a petition, unless and until the petitioner had been adjudged guilty of the offence charged.\nIt has, undoubtedly, been held in courts in Ontario and other provinces that, upon somewhat similar legislation to that now presented for our consideration, the offences of a petitioner, under the circumstances arising here, cannot be set up for the purpose of impeaching his status as a petitioner.\nI do not think that it is necessary to review in detail each one of these cases. To do so would involve a comparison of the statute or statutes upon which they were decided with the statutes we have now to consider in order that such a review might be of any value. Some of these cases, no doubt, were correctly decided upon the statutes that were then before the courts deciding them. Others would seem of doubtful authority.\nThe utmost, however, that can be said is that none of them seem to be the affirmation of any legal principal that must of necessity decide these cases now in hand.\nI propose, therefore, considering the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, the amendments thereto and the other statutes that may bear upon the issue raised in these cases independently of these authorities, none of which are binding upon this court.\nI think we must give such interpretation to section 5 of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act as it will bear upon consideration of the section itself and these other statutes that I have referred to.\nThis section five reads as follows: A petition complaining of an undue return, or undue election of a member, or of no return, or of a double return, or of any unlawful act by a candidate not returned, by which he is alleged to have become disqualified to sit in the House of Commons, at any election, may be presented to the court by any one or more of the following persons:\n(a) A person who had a right to vote at the election to which the petition relates; or\n(b) A candidate at such election.\nAnd such petition is, in this Act, called an election petition; provided always, that nothing herein contained shall prevent the sitting member from objecting; under section twelve of this Act, to any further proceeding on the petition by reason of the ineligibility or disqualification of the petitioner or from proving, under section forty-two hereof, that the petitioner was not duly elected.\nIf I had come to the consideration of what the words of sub-section (a) meant without having been embarrassed by the authorities I have referred to, I should have thought that there could be but one meaning to attach to such language.\nThe plain, ordinary meaning would certainly be that a person who had not the right at any time, during the election, to take the oath that any deputy returning officer, elector or agent had a right to tender him, could not be said to have had a right to vote at the election.\nThe language is so plain that it is hard to understand, without a review and full consideration of the cases, how it could have been interpreted otherwise. It is not now, as I have said, necessary to do so.\nWhatever may have been the legislation to be considered in relation to these words elsewhere, I think it is our duty, not being fettered by authority, to declare, in accordance with the plain, obvious meaning of the words.\nI am not oppressed with any question of convenience or inconvenience (which had weight in some of the cases), no matter how difficult the problem may become of solution by reason of the want of facility for procuring evidence, and the want of legislative provision for making a proper issue, upon which the facts might be intelligibly tried, with due regard to the rights of any one and every one concerned. I think there is no insuperable difficulty in the way.\nWith due respect, I think there never has been any difficulty in the way. The courts of each province have had imposed upon them, by section 62 of this statute, the duty to make rules for \"the effectual execution of this Act and of the intention and object thereof,\" and, if the court has any difficulty in solving the question now raised by reason of any of the considerations I have just adverted to, then the fault must lie with the court not with the legislature or with the legislation in question.\nThe failure to have provided a proper means, a due course of procedure, for the trial of an issue that obviously lay at the threshold of the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court, or judge thereof, such as that of the status of a person professing as a petitioner to have had a right to vote at the election to which his petition relates, cannot affect in any way the proper interpretation to be given to this section, since the meaning has, otherwise, become clear. The issue that sub-section (a) of section 5 presents is as simple and as clearly presented for the consideration of the court, trying to find the facts, as language can make it. The facts in one case might be of the simplest possible character; in another case, although the cause for impeaching the petitioning voter's right might be of the simplest possible character, the facts to be dealt with might render it a most difficult matter to determine. Difficulties such as these might present themselves in carrying into effect any statute and any law. The difficulties disappear when properly grappled with. It became the duty of the court to furnish by general rules, applicable to this statute, the method for carrying it into execution, and, if the court failed in doing so, it must then, by section 63, proceed according to\nthe principles, practice and rules on which election petitions, touching the election of members of the House of Commons in England were, on the 26th day of May, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four, dealt with\nso far as consistent with this Act.\nBy section 26 of 31 & 32 Vict. ch. 125 (Imp.), it was provided that\nUntil rules of court have been made in pursuance of this Act, and, so far as such rules do not extend, the principles, practice and rules on which committees of the House of Commons have heretofore acted in dealing with election petitions shall be observed so far as may be by the court and judge in the case of election petitions under this Act.\nSuch, in the absence of suitable rules for the purpose of trying the question as to the status of a petitioner, would be the law by which the court must be governed. Before the adoption of the trial of election petitions by courts of law, numerous cases indicate that committees of the House of Commons had, from time to time, been able to try and adjudicate upon the question of the right of a petitioner to present a petition.\nI am not concerned with the result of such cases. I am only concerned in pointing out that, however consistent or inconsistent the results of such trials may have been, it was recognized practice that the petitioner's right could be tried by the committee before proceeding to try the petition. The Dominion Controverted Elections Act, by the section I have quoted, plainly indicates that the sitting member might object, under section 12 to any further proceeding on the petition by reason of the ineligibility or disqualification of the petitioner.\nSection 12 required as follows:\nWithin five days after the service of the petition and the accompanying notice, the respondent may present in writing any preliminary objections or grounds of insufficiency which he has to urge against the petition or the petitioner or against any further proceeding thereon and shall, in such case, at the same time, file a copy thereof for the petitioner and the court or judge shall hear the parties upon such objections and grounds and shall decide the same in a summary manner.\nThe courts have found means of trying very important questions arising out of preliminary objections, and, in relation to such trials, have not found it difficult to find herein power in the court or judge, by virtue of this legislation, to give effect to the trial of and adjudication upon the validity or invalidity of such preliminary objections.\nI see no difficulty in the way of the use of such power even without the enactment of rules for the procedure thereof, so as to try any issue, such as is raised, in regard to the status of the petitioner in any one of the cases now before us.\nThe words \"a summary manner\" indicate a form of trial in which the ancient established course of legal proceedings may be so far disregarded as to enable an expeditious determination to be reached.\nThe rules that were formulated by the judges of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for the trial of controverted elections, which were made under and by virtue of the Act in question, and other powers vested in or inherent in such judges, by rule 52 thereof, provide:\nIn all cases not otherwise provided for, the rules of practice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia shall apply to all proceedings on election petitions. I think, therefore, with due respect, that there could be found within the various powers conferred by the Act in question directly upon the judges, the power, within the rules governing procedure in England in similar cases, (especially when establishing the introduction of the practice and power of election committees), and the inherent or expressed powers and practice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in other matters, of trying according to law the question of whether or not the petitioner in this case had, at the time of the election, a right to vote at the election in question.\nI think it should have been done.\nWithout such a trial, the proviso in section 5 and the preliminary objection against the petitioner in section 12 are, in a plain, obvious case, rendered null. And that it cannot be done in a difficult case is what should not be held in any court possessed of the ample powers that I think have been conferred by the legislation and rules I have just referred to.\nI am unable to understand where the line is to be drawn. The numerous absurd results that would follow from adopting the voters' lists as conclusive forbid drawing the line there. And when once that is departed from to try the simple issue of the petitioner, admittedly an alien, admittedly disqualified by virtue of office or from the simpler cases of that kind, I see no reason to draw the line of distinction between such cases and the more complicated cases where the petitioner may refuse to admit that he is an alien, or that he holds a disqualifying office, or that he had, in any way, become disqualified to vote at the election.\nTo render the absurdity of drawing the line at the certified voters' lists more manifest, what of the cases where there are no voters' lists?\nThis petition affirms, in words of the statute, by the petitioner, \"that he had the right to vote.\" He then swears, when presenting the petition, to an affidavit that he has good reason to believe and verily does believe that the several allegations contained in the petition are true.\nIt is not pretended that although he may have, by virtue of his own acts, so disqualified himself from voting, that he dare not have ventured to take the oath, that the deputy returning officer may have tendered him, in asking for a ballot, yet that he can take this oath verifying the petition.\nI am unable to comprehend the distinction. The plain, ordinary meaning of the words seem to indicate the same thing. The oath at the poll is of a searching character. The oath verifying the petition is not of that character. If the petitioner were disqualified, this is such a statement as he cannot properly be heard to say ought not to be tried on a preliminary investigation.\nIt would be, in fact, whatever the intention may have been, an imposition upon the court, and courts have always heretofore found ways to deal with offences of that character.\nI see no reasons for drawing the line at election petitions.\nSince writing the foregoing, I observe the following very apposite remark of Chief Justice Taylor in the Marquette Election Case[9]:\nUnless that affidavit is so presented there is properly no petition before the court. And, as I have already said, it cannot be a matter of indifference whether the required affidavit is true or false. That no affidavit has ever been objected to in Ontario can be no reason why, as counsel seemed to argue, the court must accept without question an affidavit even although it may be a false one. From the language used by Patterson J.A., In re West Simcoe[10], it is plain that the court, there, expect a petitioner to make a careful study of the facts and of the provisions of the Act as to corrupt practices before swearing to such an affidavit as is required.\nThere is, therefore, no doubt in my mind that the court can inquire as to the truthfulness of an affidavit presented with a petition and whether it has been imposed upon in connection with the presentation of a petition.\nSection 7 of the Dominion Elections Act, 1900, provides that:\nThe following persons shall be disqualified and incompetent to vote at any Dominion election, whether disqualified or incompetent or not to vote at a provincial election.\nAnd of those, sub-section (c):\npersons disqualified for taking bribes under section fifteen of the Act to disfranchise voters who have taken bribes, being chapter 14 of the statutes of 1894.\nSection 8 declares that\nthe following persons shall be disqualified and incompetent to vote at an election, etc.\nOf those are returning officers, election clerks, any person at any time employed at same election by by any person as counsel, attorney, solicitor, agent or clerk at any polling place at any such election, who has received or expects to receive any sum of money, etc., and, by section 9,\nevery person guilty at an election of the unlawful act mentioned in section 113, is disqualified from voting at such election.\nSection 113 provides that\nany voter hiring any horse * * for the purpose of conveying any voter to or from the polling place or places shall, ipso facto, be disqualified from voting at such election, etc., etc. To my mind, and I think the mind of every person conversant with the evil at which section 113 was intended to strike, this is what the section, as I have expressed it, was intended to meet.\nI am not prepared to fritter away, by a refining of the words of section 113, what obviously was intended by the enactment of section 9.\nIt was the unlawful act, in any one of its several manifold manifestations, that section 113 presents that was intended to be reached.\nWe are asked to hold that all those who may thus be disqualified by such strong and emphatic language from voting at any election are yet within the meaning of the words in section 5, persons having a right to vote.\nI have said, elsewhere, in relation to decisions upon Election Acts, that where there are so many considerations within the purview of any one of them, that, when these are added to in another or taken away by another, the general purview of the Act may not be or appear to the court to be the same and the decisions thereon should not necessarily be the same.\nI am constrained to think that, if the eminent judges whose authority is appealed to on behalf of the decision in the court below, could have had presented to them, in its present condition, the Act now under consideration and the various considerations that are suggested by the legislation since these decisions were made, that they each and all would have adopted the course of refusing to be bound by such opinions as a proper interpretation of the Act as it now stands.\nI was, at first, impressed with the review of the authorities and the decision of the late Chief Justice Moss in the Dufferin Election Case[11].\nI think, if he had survived to the present day to witness the alleged growth of \"saw-off,\" he would have been the first to realize the need of an untainted petitioner, and first, probably, to have discovered the need for and means of placing the power of petition in the hands of untainted promoters of petitions.\nSince writing the foregoing I have had the pleasure of reading the judgment herein of my brother Sir Louis Davies, and regret that I cannot agree with the distinction he draws between the cases where the Dominion Elections Act and its amendments specially disqualify the voter and those others where voters may have been guilty of other corrupt acts.\nThe first class consist of a number of whom some have been, by way of emphasis, specially declared to be disqualified. It was, obviously, necessary, in framing the Election Act, to have a disqualification clause as to judges and others disqualified by reason of office. And, as the express disqualification for some specific acts and results of or incidental to judicial investigation had crept into the Act, it would have been unwise to omit in such a general disqualification clause a repetition of all such cases, lest unintentional and unwarranted inferences should be drawn from such omission.\nI cannot think that, by reason of such special marking of disqualification in some cases, the legislation in which it is found is to be read as intending all others to be eligible to vote; for the oath the voter may have to take seems to bar him from such eligibility.\nWe are asked here to construe section 5 of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, and that specially points by express words at \"ineligibility or disqualification of the petitioner\" as grounds that may be taken by way of preliminary objection.\nI see no reason, therefore, for limiting this section 5 and also section 12 to the cases of express disqualification. The one voter is expressly and the other impliedly disqualified. And neither can, in my opinion, be held eligible to vote.\nI agree in the result of reversing the ruling, but, with respect, I think it should be unlimited.\nAppeals allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: G.

Judgment appealed from (9 Ex. C.R. 67) affirmed.\nWhere meeting ships are in collision and one of them has neglected to observe the regulations, there must be evidence of gross dereliction of duty or want of skill in navigation in order to make out a case for apportionment of damages against the other ship.\nWhere a ship navigating a narrow channel has no proper look-out and neglects to signal her course at a reasonable distance, thus perplexing and misleading a meeting ship, the former is alone responsible for all damages caused by collision, even if, in the agony of collision, a different man\u0153uvre on the part of the other ship might have avoided the accident. Judgment appealed from (9 Ex. C.R. 67) reversed, Girouard J. dissenting.\nCommentaries in the appellants' factum relating to a judgment of the Wreck Commissioner's Court, which did not form any part of the record, were ordered to be struck out, with costs to the respondents.\nSee note at p. 592, respecting appeal to Privy Council. Appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Quebec Admiralty Division [1] by which both ships were held to be at fault and were condemned for one-half the damages caused to each, respectively, by a collision in the River St. Lawrence near the Harbour of Sorel.\nThe action was brought by the respondents, owners of the \"Canada,\" for $150,000 damages suffered by her, on account of the collision, occasioned, as was alleged, by negligence and want of skill in the navigation of the \"Cape Breton.\" The appellants made a cross-demand for $6,211.40 for damages sustained by the \"Cape Breton\" by reason of the same collision. The trial took place before Mr. Justice Routhier, who rendered the judgment appealed from (1) by which both ships were held to be in fault and the appellants were condemned to pay to the respondents one-half of the damages arising out of the collision to the steamer \"Canada,\" while the respondents were condemned to pay to the appellants (as counter-claimants) one-half of the damages suffered by the \"Cape Breton,\" the parties, respectively, to pay their own costs.\nThe appellants now appeal from that part of the judgment whereby they are held to be in any way to blame for the collision in question, and are condemned to bear part of the damages caused thereby or any costs incurred in consequence thereof.\nThe material facts of the case and questions at issue on this appeal are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported.\nAt the hearing the respondents moved to strike out portions of the appellant's factum which referred to, reproduced and commented upon the judgment of the Wreck Commissioners' Court, a document which did not form a part of the present case on the appeal. Counsel were heard for the motion and contra.\nHarris K.C., F. Meredith K.C. and Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. (H olden with them), for the appellants, relied upon the decisions in The Turret Steamship Co. v. Jenks[2]; The \"Cuba\" v. McMillan[3]; The \"Victory\"[4];\n*NOTE:\u2014The text of the Privy Council judgment referred to (not officially reported) delivered 20th March, 1901, is as follows:\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPERIOR COURT SITTING IN REVIEW, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nThe Turret Steamship Company v. William G. Jenks, and others.\nPresent.\u2014The Lord Chancellor, Lord Macnaghten, Lord Davey, Lord Robertson, Lord Lindley.\nTHE LORD CHANCELLOR.\u2014In this case their Lordships have had the opportunity of considering the matter without reserving judgment. Unlike a great many cases of the sort, the surrounding circumstances as well as the direct evidence make the cause of the collision particularly clear. The \"Turret Age\" was going up and the \"Lloyd S. Porter\" was coming down the River St. Lawrence. According to the rules which deal with narrow channels such as that which, in one sense in any event, both vessels were in, speaking broadly, each vessel ought to keep to its own side of the road.\nTheir Lordships will not stay for a moment to consider the question who was in or who was out of the channel. It is clear, according to the evidence, that the \"Lloyd S. Porter\" in disregard of that rule was coming down on her wrong side. The result was that the vessel that was going up and which was on its proper side was placed according to the whole of the evidence in considerable difficulties. It is idle to speak of the recognition by either vessel of the other as big or little. It is at night. All that the parties can see at a reasonable distance (such a distance as would be necessary to avoid the danger of collision) is the lights by which they are guided if they see them and if they look out for them. So far as the \"Turret Age\" is concerned there appears to have been a very careful look-out. There was no doubt that the pilot was there giving directions and observing what was being done. If one looks at the evidence of what The \"James Mackenzie\"[5]; The \"Thing-valla\"[6]; Wilson, Sons & Co. v. Currie[7]; The \"Arabian\" v. The \"Alma\"[8]; The \"Ngapoota\"[9];\nwas done on board the other vessel, the \"Lloyd S. Porter,\" it is impossible to doubt that there really was no look-out at all. The only person who purports to be looking out at all is the helmsman who comes on deck about fifteen minutes before the collision. He receives one direction to keep the vessel so as to avoid the buoy and then he is left to be guided by whatever he may choose to consider a fulfilment of that direction. It is probably fair to suppose that the point of light that he does select is one which, in the then condition of things, would enable him to clear the buoy. That is all he does and that is the only direction given to him and the only thing that he purports to do. On the other hand, the \"Turret Age\" is encountered by a vessel which, if it is performing the man\u0153uvres that it ought to perform, will keep clear of them. They proceed, and their Lordships think that they had a right to proceed, upon the fair belief that the vessel which they saw was going to perform the proper man\u0153uvres for the purpose of avoiding any difficulty or danger. Suddenly and without any warning the vessel that they were meeting changes her course and suddenly starboards. The whole point of the controversy between the parties resolves itself into a question of whether, upon that sudden man\u0153uvre made by the \"Lloyd S. Porter,\" there was time to avoid the collision by any counter-man\u0153uvre that could be made by the \"Turret Age.\"\nTheir Lordships have had the advantage of a nautical assessor to whom they have propounded the questions: First, \"Whether or not the 'Turret Age' was right in keeping to the north side of channel?\" And he is of opinion that she was right in keeping to the north side. Their Lordships have also asked him: \"Whether, in his judgment, there was time, under the circumstances proved, by any man\u0153uvre on the part of the 'Turret Age' to avoid the collision?\" He is of opinion that there was no time to avoid the collision under the circumstances.\nPutting those two propositions together, with the circumstances that have been referred to, it would seem to be clear that the one vessel, because she was a light vessel and because she did not care about great The \"Bywell Castle\"[10]; The \"Tasmania\"[11]; The \"Nor\"[12]; The \"Sarah Thorp\" v. The \"America\"[13]; The \"Glannibanta\"[14]; The \"Maud Pye\"[15]; The \"Rabboni\"[16]; The \"Bold Buccleugh\"[17]; Ward v. The \"Ogdensburg\"[18]; The \"Ottawa\"[19]; The \"Shenandoah\" and The \"Crete\"[20].\nWhere fault on the part of one vessel is established by uncontradicted testimony and such fault is of itself sufficient to account for the disaster, it is not enough for such vessel to raise a doubt with regard to the management of the other vessel. There is at least\ndepth of water, was so loosely and vaguely steered that she might have been in or out of the channel, without there being any wilful misrepresentation in what the witnesses have said. Their Lordships think the more reasonable hypothesis would be, considering what she was steering for and where she was coming from, that she was in the channel; up to a certain time, on the north side of it. The position of the wreck afterwards does not seem to be conclusive as to where she was at the moment of the collision because there would be certainly the question both of wind and stream to be considered; but undoubtedly it brings it all within a very narrow compass. In the result, their Lordships are of opinion that the \"Lloyd S. Porter\" was wholly and solely to blame and they will, therefore, humbly advise His Majesty to allow the appeal, to reverse the judgment of the Superior Court, in Review, with costs, and to reverse the judgment of the Superior Court, and order judgment to be entered for the appellants in their action and also in the cross-action which was brought by the respondents with the costs of both the action and cross-action, and to remit the case to the Superior Court for the assessment of the damages to be paid by the respondents.\nThe respondents must pay the costs of the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs. some presumption adverse to its claim, and any reasonable doubt with regard to the propriety of the conduct of such other vessel should be resolved in its favour. The \"Samuel Dilleway\"[21]; The \"Parkersburg\"[22]; The \"Atlas\"[23]; The \"Young America\"[24]; Chamberlain v. Ward[25].\nThe \"Canada\" should have kept to her starboard side of the fairway, but in any event, even if she had had a right to starboard her helm the last time, she was bound to indicate by the proper signal to the \"Cape Breton\" her intention to do so before leaving her own side of the fairway and the \"Canada\" should in any event have stopped and reversed before the collision. Regulations, arts. 25, 28 and 23; The \"Clydach\"[26]; The \"Victory\"[27]; \"River Derwent\"[28]; The \"Bermuda\"[29].\nThe presumptions are always against a vessel failing to comply with the narrow channel rule.

When the collision, from any cause, could not be avoided, both vessels were bound to take such action as might best aid to avert collision. The \"Canada\" did so, while the \"Cape Breton\" failed to do so and was negligently and unskilfully navigated. Further, the well-known rule of prudent seamanship was infringed when the \"Cape Breton\" put her helm hard-a-port and reversed full speed astern with a right-handed propeller, to a green light.\nThe trial judge, before whom all the witnesses were heard, believed the pilots of the \"Canada,\" but did not credit the pilot of the \"Cape Breton.\" He came to the conclusion that the three lights and then the green light of the \"Canada\" were seen at a much earlier period and a much great distance than the \"Cape Breton's\" witnesses pretend, and that the collision was largely due to the error of her pilot in determining at first to pass port side to port side and obstinately persisting in that resolution though having reason to know, and in fact knowing, that the approaching vessel was about to enter the Harbour of Sorel in the manner provided by regulation 33, which provides that:\nUnless it is otherwise directed by the Harbour Commissioners of Montreal, ships and vessels entering or leaving the Harbour of Sorel shall take the port side, anything in the preceding articles to the contrary notwithstanding.\nHe held also that the helm of the \"Canada\" was not altered after passing the last buoy until the whistle of the \"Cape Breton\" was first heard; and he accordingly determined that the \"Cape Breton\" was to blame in each of the three respects above mentioned.\nThe learned judge further held that the \"Canada\" was also to blame; that she was not provided with the proper look-out; that the lights of the \"Cape Breton\" were properly exhibited and burning efficiently and should have been seen by the people on board the \"Canada,\" at least a mile off, and would have been so seen had there been an efficient look-out. He held, further, that the \"Canada\" should have blown two blasts of her whistle at an earlier period than she actually did, viz., when slightly starboarding on passing the third buoy and directing her true course on Sorel. And for these various acts on her part he held the \"Canada\" also to blame.\nAs to the look-out, two men thoroughly familiar with the navigation of that portion of the St. Lawrence were in the wheel house, one managing the wheel as pilot and the other as look-out, provided with powerful binoculars for use if required. There was no other look-out. The services of the pilot in a proper position for seeing and conversant with the lights which he was likely to meet were in fact and in law those of a proper look-out and more likely to be serviceable than, in the present instance, the knowledge of the look-out forward of the \"Cape Breton.\"\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs for the following amongst other reasons: 1. Because the side lights of the \"Cape Breton\" were not exhibited as required by law after she had raised her anchor and proceeded on her course immediately before the collision and because such lights were, if in their places, immediately before the collision so placed after the vessel was under way, and were not burning brightly and efficiently as provided by the regulations. 2. Because no proper and efficient look-out was kept on board the \"Cape Breton.\" 3. Because the \"Cape Breton\" ported her helm from time to time improperly in view of the position and approach of the \"Canada.\" 4. Because the \"Cape Breton\" neglected to sound a blast of the whistle as by law obliged when she ported her helm at the distance of about a mile. 5. Because the people of the \"Cape Breton\" knew that the \"Canada\" was steering her course, for her port, the Harbour of Sorel, and improperly determined to pass across her course and to the south of her, in contravention of the established regulations. 6. Because the \"Cape Breton\" after porting twice sounded one blast of her whistle and put her helm hard-a-port improperly, a man\u0153uvre which immediately led to the collision. 7. Because in putting her helm hard to port, the \"Cape Breton\" was also put full speed astern with a right-handed propeller, making the collision inevitable. 8. Because the evidence as found by the learned judge establishes that the \"Cape Breton\" improperly neglected to ease or stop her engines at any time before whistling.\nBesides the authorities mentioned in the notes furnished by the trial judge, we submit the following: \"Starboard Side,\" Marsden (4 ed.) p. 514; Todd & Whall, Practical Seamanship, p. 281; \"Stopping and Reversing,\" art. 23, Moore's Rule of the Road at Sea, p. 51; \"Slacken Speed,\" The \"Beryl\"[32]; The \"Benares\"[33]; Marsden[34]; The \"Germany\" v.

The \"Canada\" is alone to blame for this collision.\nThere is, in the record, no evidence that the \"Cape Breton's\" crew were guilty, on the occasion, of any wrongful manoeuvre at all, so that, as I view the case, there is no room in it for the application of the law on collisions whenever caused or contributed to by errors of judgment committed, in extremis.\nThe respondents' contentions rest on a palpable error. They assume that the \"Cape Breton's\" crew were aware of the fact that the \"Canada\" had no proper look-out and did not see their side lights. But there is no foundation whatever for that assumption. It is the contrary that the \"Cape Breton's\" crew assumed, and, in law, were bound to assume. The Dorchester[52]. And having no reason whatever to doubt when they first sighted the \"Canada,\" that she, seeing their regulation lights (as they believed she did), would act lawfully and keep her course in the North Channel, her crew were not. in fault for not stopping and reversing sooner. Wilson, Sons & Co. v. Currie[53]; The Free State[54]. They were justified up to the last moment in relying upon the \"Canada\" obeying the ordinary rules, by which both were bound, instead of doggedly and recklessly persisting, as she did,, in unlawfully attempting to force them to disregard those rules. Turrett v. Jenks[55], in the Privy Council, 1901. A mere apprehension, had there been room for it, that the \"Canada\" would persist in starboarding her helm would not, under the circumstances, have been a valid reason for the \"Cape Breton\" to leave the south side of the channel, assuming always, as she rightly did, that the \"Canada\" had her (the \"Cape Breton's\") red light in sight as soon as the latter had the former's light in sight. To justify a departure from a rule of the. road in such a case it must appear with perfect clearness, amounting almost to certainty, that adhering to the rule would have brought on a collision, and violating the rule would have avoided it. See per Dr. Lushington, in the Boanerges v. The Anglo-Indian[56]. Of course, if the \"Cape Breton\" instead of sounding a first blast and porting her helm had, at that moment, sounded two blasts and starboarded her helm, or had stopped and reversed, it is now evident that there would have been no collision. But there was no reason whatever then for her to do either one or the other, and \"being wise after the event\" cannot be a guide for our decision. The question is: Was the possibility of a collision then present? Could her pilot then foresee any immediate danger of it? The \"Canada's\" own manoeuvring answers \"No.\" She would herself, had she seen the \"Cape Breton's\" red light in time, either have stopped or ported her helm; and the \"Cape Breton\" could reasonably remain certain up to the last moment, not being aware of the fact that she had no eyes to see her (the \"Cape Breton's) red light that she, the \"Canada,\" would either stop, or port, in time, not attempt madly to cross her bow as she did.\nCertainly, as argued by the respondents, the \"Cape Breton\" would not, in law, have been justified in standing upon her right obstinately, recklessly and regardless of the safety of the \"Canada\" if, by any man\u0153uvre whatever, she could have prevented a collision. But, when charging her with want of skill and negligently failing to adopt measures to avoid a collision, it was incumbent upon the \"Canada\" to prove, without any doubt, not only that her crew had it in their power to adopt safe measures to avoid it, but also that they must necessarily have been perfectly convinced, in time to avoid it, of the imminent danger of it. See per Dr. Lushington, in \"The Legatus\" v. \"The Emily\"[57]. And that proof is entirely wanting. It is only when it was too late to avoid the collision that the \"Canada\" shewed her green light to the \"Cape Breton.\" When the \"Cape Breton\" sounded her first blast, she had the \"Canada's\" red light in sight. So that the possibility of any danger at all could not then have come to her pilot's mind.\nThe sole cause of the accident is that the \"Canada's\" crew did not see the \"Cape Breton's\" red light till after the \"Cape Breton's\" first blast, when she ought to have ported her helm, as the \"Cape Breton\" rightly depended upon her doing so. And the reason why they did not see that light is presumed, in law, to be because they did not in fact have a proper look-out. R.S.C. ch. 79, sec. 6. \"The Englishman\"[58]. And the principle in such cases, where there has been a departure from an important rule of navigation, is that if it is at all possible that the non-observance of the rule has caused the accident then the party in default cannot be excused. Emery v. Cichero[59]; McCabe v. Old Dominion S.S. Co.[60]. Here, there is no room for doubting that if the \"Canada\" had seen the \"Cape Breton's\" red light before hearing her first blast, she would either have kept to the north side of the channel, or, before starboarding her helm to take her course towards Sorel, would have sounded two blasts. The \"Cuba\" v. McMillan[61]; \"The Victory\"[62]. If the \"Canada\" had ported her helm when she heard the \"Cape Breton's\" first blast, the weight of the evidence is that the collision would have been avoided. However that may be, it is clear that if the \"Cape Breton\" had continued on her same course or starboarded her helm when she heard the \"Canada's\" two blasts, she could not have prevented the collision. R.S.C. ch. 79, sec. 5. The \"Canada's\" man\u0153uvring had then rendered it inevitable.\nThere was then no possibility for the \"Cape Breton\" of avoiding the collision, (says Hamelin, her pilot): To starboard her helm then would have made matters still worse, (says McNeil, her first mate): When the \"Canada\" sounded her two blasts there was no possibility of avoiding a collision, (says Bromley, her look-out).\nAnd any reasonable doubt on this point, were there any, must be solved in favour of the appellants. The respondents were deliberate transgressors of the law; on them\u2014I repeat it\u2014was the burden of proving clearly that the appellants' crew might, by ordinary skill and prudence, have avoided the collision. They have failed to do so. Emery v. Cichero[63]; Valentine v. Cleugh[64]; The \"City of New York\"[65]; The \"Chicago\"[66]; The \"Teaser\"[67].' The weight of the evidence is the other way. Had the \"Canada\" been a few few further north, so as to sink the \"Cape Breton\" instead of the \"Cape Breton\" sinking her, the \"Cape Breton\" could not have been found guilty of negligence or of wrong manoeuvring. Such a plea by the \"Canada\" in that case in answer to the \"Cape Breton's\" claim would have been equivalent to saying to her, \"Why did you not starboard your helm and sink us both?\" The \"Agra\" and \"Elizabeth Jenkins\"[68]. With logic of the same force she now says to her: \"You blundered because you should have given us a chance to sink you with us.\" Rule 33 as to Sorel Harbour has no possible application. The \"Cape Breton\" was not going to Sorel and the \"Canada\" knew it. It is not the case, as the respondents' contentions on this point would necessarily lead to, that every ship going from Montreal to Quebec or England has to pass through the Harbour of Sorel. Then, when the \"Canada,\" with a meeting ship in sight, coming almost end on, which she knew was not going to Sorel, changed her helm at a point arbitrarily chosen by herself, two miles away from Sorel, to direct her course to port, presumably intending to force that ship to meet her under the Sorel rules instead of the St. Lawrence rules, which, up to that moment, governed them both, it was incumbent upon her to sound the two regular blasts. When the \"Cape Breton's\" pilot saw her closing upon him, but not sounding two blasts, he was led to think that she did not intend to put herself across the \"Cape Breton's\" bow. On the contrary, by not then sounding two blasts she warned the \"Cape Breton\" to keep her course in the South Channel; yet she would now say to her: \"You ought to have crossed over to the North Channel; I deceived you, but you were wrong to believe me.\" The respondents' contentions, based on this Sorel rule, are, however, only an afterthought. The simple reason that the \"Canada\" directed her course towards Sorel so far away from it without previously signally to the \"Cape Breton\" her intention to do so, is that she did not then see her, and she did not see her Because she had no proper look-out. Had she seen her she would have steadied her course up the river and steered towards Sorel only after passing her. Her pilot admits it.\nGreat stress has been laid by the respondents on the flash of the \"Canada's\" green light that the \"Cape Breton\" is proved to have had in sight for a moment, when still a mile, at least, away from her, not ceasing herself to shew her red light to the \"Canada.\" But that is a piece of evidence which seems to tell more in favour of the appellants than in their favour. By the fact that the green light was immediately shut out from the \"Cape Breton's\" sight, the red one and the white one only remaining in sight, the \"Cape Breton's\" crew had reason to believe that this momentary flash of it was due either to the sinuosities of the channel or to the sheering of the \"Canada\" in the current. Had the \"Canada,\" having the \"Cape Breton's\" red light in sight, or presumed by the \"Cape Breton's\" crew to have had it in sight, and herself then not ceasing to shew her red light to the \"Cape Breton,\" intended then to change her course and make for the south shore, she would before doing it, as already remarked, have reasonably been expected by the \"Cape Breton\" to sound the two regular blasts. And by not doing so at that moment, the \"Cape Breton's\" crew rightly assumed that the \"Canada\" intended to observe the rule of the road and meet her port to port, she not having signalled a contrary intention. There certainly was then no immediate danger of collision, no reason for either ship to stop and reverse, and for the \"Cape Breton\" to then starboard her helm, with the \"Canada's\" red light in sight, would have been a flagrant breach of the rules.\nThe appeal is allowed; decree to be entered for appellants on the action and on the cross-action, with costs on both in both courts against the respondents; case remitted to the Exchequer Court, Quebec Admiralty District, for the assessment in the usual way of the damages to be paid by the respondents.\nThe \"Rules of the Road\" now in force in Canada, which govern the case, are those promulgated by the Order in Council of the 9th of February, 1897, page LXXXI\u2014Statutes of 1897 (D.).\nThe motion by the respondents to strike out of appellants' factum their commentaries upon the judgment of the Wreck Commissioner's Court is allowed with costs. That judgment does not form part of the record and could not legally have been received in evidence.\nSEDGEWICK J. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal with costs and remitting the case back to the court below to have damages assessed; also in the order striking out irrelevant matter in the appellants' factum.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting):\u2014The principles of law governing cases of collision are well known and easily understood, but their application to the special circumstances proved has always been difficult. The evidence on both sides in this case form two immense volumes, and there is a big volume of exhibits consisting of photographs, maps and plans, which were explained by the witnesses to the local judge in admiralty of Quebec (Routhier J.) of great experience in cases of this description; and this: may account for the absence of nautical assessors; whose attendance was not even suggested by either party.\nBefore reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Routhier, I would certainly refer the case to the court below in order to obtain the opinion of one or more nautical assessors as to whether there was time for the \"Cape Breton,\" on the evidence, to avoid the collision\u2014a course which seems to be in accord with the decision of the Privy Council on the appeal of the Turrett Steamship Company, Limited v. Jenks and others[69], decided in 1901, relied upon by the appellants, and in the still more recent case of The \"Empress of India\" v. The Imperial Chinese Government[70], decided in August last, but not yet reported. Their Lordships even referred the question to nautical assessors to report to themselves. I doubt that this court, having only a statutory constitution, can go so far, but we certainly can send the case back to the court below for the purpose of obtaining that information. Little reliance can be placed upon the opinions of experts examined as witnesses who almost invariably support the views of the party who retains their services.\nOf course we had the explanations of the volume of exhibits by counsel, but no one will contend that they are as valuable as those made by the witnesses. Furthermore, the trial judge has entirely, and apparently for good cause, discredited some of the witnesses, of the appellant, especially pilot Hamelin, and expressed a preference for others.\nUnfortunately, (he says), the questions of fact are a great source of embarrassment in this cause by reason of the great number of witnesses heard and of the astonishingly conflicting evidence produced by them. Several of the witnesses seem to believe it is their duty to swear contrary to what the witnesses of the adverse party have affirmed and that they are called in court but for that purpose.\nUnder the circumstances I do not feel inclined to interfere with his findings of fact, and I think the soundness of his rulings of law cannot seriously be questioned. I do not intend to review the facts of the case. This gigantic work has been exhaustively done by the learned judge in his reasons for judgment, which cover nearly thirty pages of the printed case. He has so fairly summed up in a few pages the whole situation as it existed when it was yet time for the \"Cape Breton\" to avoid the accident\u2014which seems to be the only point dividing this court\u2014that I cannot do better in concluding than reproduce them:\nLet us now go into a more detailed examination of the course of the \"Canada\" and of the \"Cape Breton\" and let us see what mistakes were made on both sides which led them to the collision. I say at first that the two vessels perceived one another from a distance and that having ascertained they were coming closer, the \"Cape Breton\" had the right to believe they would meet according to rule 18, that is to say, each keeping to the right, red light to red light. Here is this rule 18; it reads as follows:\n\"When two steam vessels are meeting end on or nearly end on so as to involve the risk of collision each shall alter her course to starboard so that each may pass on the port side of the other.\"\nWell, the \"Cape Breton\" evidently relied on this rule and thenceforth she had the right to follow the right of the channel, that is to say the south according to rule 25, which says:\n\"In narrow channels every steam vessel shall, when it is safe and practicable, keep to that side of the fairway or midchannel which lies on the starboard side of such vessel.\"\nIt is simple and consistent with the law.\nWith respect to the \"Canada\" the question of the course to be taken became on the contrary complex. She was going to Sorel and the lights of the Harbour of Sorel were already visible at the horizon on her left side; consequently, two different courses were open to her to meet the \"Cape Breton,\" and in taking into consideration the general practice followed by her she might have thought she had to choose between two conflicting rules,\u2014rule 18 which told her as well as the \"Cape Breton\": \"Meet to your right\"; and rule 33, applicable to the Harbour of Sorel, which told her: \"Meet to your left.\"\nRule 33 says this:\n\"Unless it is otherwise directed by the Harbour Commissioners of Montreal, ships and vessels entering or leaving the Harbour of Sorel shall take the port side, anything in the preceding articles to the contrary notwithstanding.\"\nThe first of these courses, that is to say according to rule 18, was certainly, in my opinion, the safest, because it is the general rule, the rule known to all mariners, and a great number of them even know of no other rule with respect to meeting one another. I have had proof of this in a number of cases that have come before me.\nIn following it the meeting would have taken place in perfect security, and without lengthening in a perceptible measure the course towards Sorel.\nBut the \"Canada\" was in the habit, as the other boats of the plaintiff company were, to take the direction of the Harbour of Sorel, immediately after having passed the last black buoy and even occasionally between the two black buoys, so as to follow the tangent, instead of a line more or less angular, and the mariners in charge of this vessel did not dream of departing from this habit and this practice.\nEvidently it never struck them,\u2014First, that this practice was, perhaps, not known to all mariners; and,\u2014Secondly, that the vessel to meet might not have known the \"Canada\" and not be aware that she was going to Sorel; and finally, that the Sorel wharf was still two miles distant, and that the extent of this harbour is determined by no law, unfortunately, and has no measurement nor known boundaries, and that rule 33 was, perhaps, not applicable to this part of the river where they were then and where the meeting was to take place.\nNo doubt of this kind seems, however, to have crossed their minds, and when they had passed the last black buoy they changed their course and inclined towards the south, applying thenceforth rule 33, and preparing to meet on the left the steamer which was coming towards them.\nSeemingly, with perfect security, they probably said: \"The officers on the steamer coming to meet us must know who we are, and where we are going, and they must know, as we do, rule 33 of the Harbour of Sorel.\" But it was presuming too much on the knowledge and information possessed by the officers of the \"Cape Breton,\" and it was taking as unquestionable their contention that from that place and from the moment they left the ship channel, they were entering the Harbour of Sorel, which is not absolutely certain. It was wanting to impose on the other vessel a local and not a universal practice. Undoubtedly, we can say: \"It was not only a practice and a habit, it was rule 33, and even with respect to the habit, it is just to take it into account.\" So, if one refers to Marsden, on page 370, we read this:-\n\"But though the regulations are the paramount rules of navigation, yet where the usage of the place and the business and courses of particular vessels are obvious and well-known, no seaman has a right to neglect the knowledge he has of the probable movements of other ships with reference to such usage.\" Spencer, at page 44, sec. 22, says this:\n\"Where well-known usage has sanctioned a particular method of navigating local waters, it is competent for the court to admit evidence of such usage, and if it be proved that the matter is regulated by general usage, the court may, in its discretion, hold the vessel to conform to such usage.\"\nDifferent from a general principle, usage is of an exceptional application in the discretion of the court, which is bound to weigh the circumstances and to take usage into account.\nWell then, I say this: In this situation, and weighing all the circumstances of the evidence, I think that the obligation was upon the officers of the \"Canada\" to signal the \"Cape Breton\" of their intention to pass on the left instead of passing on the right.\nIt is a general principle, if a steamer follows a course that may appear extraordinary to the other steamers, though justified by special reasons, she does it at her risk and peril, and if she wishes the other steamers to be informed of it she must signal her intentions, because the others have a right to presume that her course will be conformable to the ordinary rules. There is occasion in this case to apply rule 28, because both vessels were following a course they thought authorized by the regulations.\nRule 28 says this:\n\"When vessels are in sight of one another, a, steam vessel under way in taking any course authorized or required by these rules, shall indicate that course by the following signals on her whistle or siren, viz:\u2014One short blast, to mean:\u2014'I am directing my course to starboard.' Two short blasts, to mean:\u2014'I am directing my course to port.' Three short blasts, to mean: \u2014'My engines are going full speed astern.' \"\nI say that the \"Canada\" in such a case, should have blown two blasts to say:\u2014\"I am going to port side and not to starboard.\"\nWhen two steamers mutually perceive each other going in opposite directions, and going to meet one another, and there is any doubt as to the direction of one of them, rule 28 becomes obligatory, and they must mutually signal each other by blasts of the whistle to inform each other and naturally they must signal each other when it is still in time and not wait until it is too late. In the present case both steamers are in fault in this respect. As soon as the \"Cape Breton\" saw the \"Canada\" change her course, a man\u0153uvre which suddenly shewed her green light for an instant, (this is proved by the officers of the \"Cape Breton\") she should have understood that the \"Canada\" was directing her course towards the south, or at least that her course was uncertain, and she should have then, from that moment, have blown a blast of the whistle. Likewise, the \"Canada,\" which was preparing to meet differently from the requirements of rule 18, should have informed the \"Cape Breton\" of it by two blasts of the whistle. The \"Canada\" was all the more obliged to do it, as she was following a course which was familiar to her, but which was not to the \"Cape Breton,\" and of which the \"Cape Breton\" could ignore the reason. I therefore say that, under these circumstances, and to avoid the collision which they should have foreseen, the two steamers should have exchanged blasts of the whistle to mutually inform each other of their respective courses, and that they should not wait till it was too late as did the \"Cape Breton.\"\nThere were still other man\u0153uvres which the circumstances commended them to use to avoid the collision, and which I blame them for neglecting. I cite to this effect Spencer on Collisions, p. 93, sec 26, intituled:\u2014\"Where lights are doubtful,\" and who says what follows:\n\"Keeping a steamer under way at full speed when there is uncertainty as to the meaning of the lights carried by another vessel is negligence per se.\"\nThe author cites four precedents in support of this doctrine. At p. 193, sec. 80, he says:\n\"Under the rules, the obligation to reduce speed arises whenever there is any uncertainty as to a vessel's own position or the movements or course of an approaching vessel sufficiently near at hand to render her a menace to the other's safety. \"Where uncertainty of position or of course is coupled with dangerous proximity, both vessels should reverse and come to a stop, until all uncertainty its to each other's situation is determined.\"\nFive precedents are cited in a foot-note in support of this doctrine.\nLet us apply these two rules of conduct, which are based upon reason and jurisprudence to the facts proved on both sides in this case, and we should, I think, conclude therefrom that neither the \"Canada\" nor the \"Cape Breton,\" complied with these rules.\nIn the first place, the officers of the \"Canada\" contend that up to the last minute the \"Cape Breton\" shewed neither red nor green light.\nTill the first blast of the \"Cape Breton's\" whistle, they swear having seen only her white light, which would not have been sufficient to inform them as to the steamer's course.\nIf this be true, they must then have been in great uncertainty with respect to the meaning of this white light, which was moving all the same, and which was drawing nearer and on the course they were following, and the danger of being drawn nearer was being added to this uncertainty. What were they then to do? The, text writers and jurisprudence answer: \"They should at first reduce speed, reverse and come to a stop until all uncertainty had ceased. Now they did neither one thing nor the other. Therefore, they are in fault.\"\nDid the \"Cape Breton\" behave better? Her officers tell us they were going down the river at full speed. On leaving Sorel, they perceived the white light on the \"Canada's\" mast and her saloon lights. They say they did not know it was the \"Canada,\" but they saw the lights of an upbound steamer. She was still four miles distant at the time. Then they saw her red light, and they ported their helm to meet on the right. This is not what I blame them for. That was all right. Thus the \"Canada's\" red light indicated she was directing her course towards the north to meet on the right and the \"Cape Breton\" was directing her course towards the south.\nBut one thing which should have astonished the officers of the \"Cape Breton\" is, that while shewing her red light, the \"Canada\" was also remaining almost in a line with the \"Cape Breton\" which, nevertheless, kept her helm to port and was tending obliquely towards starboard.\nAll of a sudden the \"Canada\" shewed her green light. McNeill and Hamelin said it was but a flash which did not last long. I have serious doubts upon this point and there are many reasons to believe that from that very moment the \"Cape Breton\" must have seen the three lights and that afterwards she must have seen but the green light when the \"Canada\" had changed her course after passing the second black buoy. Be it as it may, the sudden appearance of this green light, and the fact that the \"Canada\" was drawing near the south, instead of getting away towards the north were sufficient to give rise in the minds of the officers of the \"Cape Breton\" to serious doubts as to the meaning of the green flash and upon the true course of the \"Canada.\"\nBut are these doubts mere hypotheses, or did they exist in the minds of the officers McNeill and Hamelin? Yes; these doubts did exist.\nI find the proof of the same in their testimonies, and I also find it in the log-book, where this uncertainty is recorded. It is sufficient to see upon this point the citation of the log-book in Captain Reid's evidence. Here follows what we read there:\u2014\n\"A few minutes before the collision the \"Canada's\" masthead and port side lights were shewing at about one point or one and a quarter off our port bow. The pilot finding the \"Canada\" was closing in on him, ported and kept to starboard. A little later on, the pilot asked me: 'What does he mean. I am keeping to starboard and he is closing in on me?' Then the pilot ported and blew one blast of the whistle. The \"Canada\" answered by blowing two blasts. The wheel was put hard-a-port, the pilot again blew one blast, and ordered the engines stopped and full speed astern.\"\nThis is what we find in the log-book.\nAs we see, the pilot was noticing that the \"Canada's\" light was always at one point or one and a quarter points on the port bow, notwithstanding that the \"Cape Breton\" was going full speed to starboard. In spite of having ported his helm, the \"Canada\" was always closing in on him. What does this mean, he said to the other officers. What is the steamer doing? I am going more and more to starboard and she pursues me.\nTherefore Hamelin was in doubt. He no longer understood the \"Canada's intentions, the meeting of the flash of the green light, and the course the \"Canada\" was following.\nIn this condition of uncertainty, he should: (1) Reduce his speed; (2) Reverse and come to a stop until he could understand what course the \"Canada\" was following. He did neither one nor the other of these two things, and made the same mistake as the \"Canada.\"\nThere is more, and that must have increased pilot Hamelin's uncertainty. It is the fact that he was then a few hundred feet outside of the channel to the south and that he was consequently deviating from the course generally followed by steamers and from the one he had himself intended to follow in leaving Sorel. Since he wanted to pass north of the black buoy, as I heretofore said, and that if the \"Canada\" obstinately kept barring his way, he himself shewed the same obstinancy in placing himself across the \"Canada's\" way. Such a course followed by two steamers toward the south outside the channel must have appeared to him at least, strange, and increased his uncertainty.\nThe \"Canada\" could at least say: \"I am here because I am going to Sorel,\" but she, the \"Cape Breton,\" (which was going down to Quebec), why was she out of the main channel; and why did she persist in wanting to pass south of the \"Canada,\" while her ordinary course towards Quebec was north and free?\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs. I am not satisfied that the judgment appealed from is wrong. Before reversing, I would certainly require the opinion of competent and disinterested experts and, for that reason, I would agree that the case be sent back to the court below for the purpose of getting the opinion of three nautical assessors upon the question as to whether there was time, under the circumstances proved, by any manoeuvre on the part of the \"Cape Breton,\" to avoid the collision; costs then to follow final decision.\nNESBITT J.\u2014The action is one by the Richelieu Company in respect of a collision which occurred about 2.35 a.m. of the 12th June, 1904, between the steamers \"Canada\" and the SS. \"Cape Breton\" in the St. Lawrence River about two miles below Sorel, which lies at the mouth of the Richelieu. The case was argued at great length, the evidence being voluminous, but I have concluded the essential facts are within small compass.\nThe \"Cape Breton\" had been anchored over night in the River St. Lawrence opposite the Harbour of Sorel. She had weighed anchor and had proceeded about two miles down the River St. Lawrence when the collision occurred. The \"Canada\" was on her way up the river from Quebec. The River St. Lawrence flows in a northeasterly direction so that the \"Cape Breton\" had the south shore on her starboard side and the \"Canada's\" starboard was towards the north shore. The boats came into collision on the south side of the fairway or mid-channel line, the \"Cape Breton's\" stem striking the \"Canada\" on her starboard quarter between the pilot house and wheel-box. The \"Cape Breton\" was damaged to some extent by the collision and the \"Canada\" sank in about thirty-five feet of water, with her bow about 400 feet south of the centre line of the channel.\nBoth vessels were carrying the regulation lights. The \"Canada\" was steaming at about 14 miles an hour, and the \"Cape Breton\" at about ten miles an hour. The \"Cape Breton\" was being navigated by a regularly licensed branch pilot, and her first officer (who carried a master's certificate) was in command of the vessel on the bridge with the pilot. An able-bodied seaman was stationed in the \"Cape Breton's\" bow in the capacity of \"look-out,\" and having no other duties to perform, while the ship's boatswain and another able-bodied seaman completed the watch on deck at the time. The \"Canada\" had no look-out, and the red and green lights of the \"Cape Breton\" were not seen by any one. When the \"Canada\" arrived at the north of the black buoy described in the evidence, she not having seen the lights indicating an approaching vessel changed her course and turned for Sorel without giving any signal to any approaching vessel that she was going to the other side of the channel, and in effect becoming a crossing instead of a passing vessel. It is at this point only of the case I have entertained any doubt, because, if the evidence satisfied me that, notwithstanding this default, nevertheless those in charge of the \"Cape Breton\" should or did see the green light indicating an approaching crossing vessel, then I think the \"Cape Breton\" would be partially to blame. If, on the other hand, the fact of the \"Canada\" attempting to cross only became apparent after the first blast and the answer to it, then I think no fault can be attributed to those in charge, even if, in the agony of collision, a different movement might have avoided the accident. Certain principles seem to me to be well settled by the authorities. First, that these vessels were approaching each in a narrow channel and rule 25 was applicable, which compels each to keep to that side of the fairway or mid-channel, which lies on the starboard side of the vessel. The \"Canada\" answers by referring to rule 33 by which ships entering or leaving Sorel are directed to take the port side, but even assuming the point where the \"Canada\" changed her course was within that rule (which I am inclined to think it was not), she was bound under the combined effect of rules 27 and 28 to give notice to an approaching vessel of the intention to so direct her course as to cross the other. Assuming after that the \"Canada\" was properly on her course she was bound under article 19 to keep out of the way of the \"Cape Breton,\" and if necessary to slacken her speed or stop and reverse. She neither gave notice of her change of course from that to be assumed under rule 25 she was going to follow nor attempted to keep out of the way, nor slackened, nor stopped, nor reversed, and the conclusion is irresistible that she behaved as she did simply because she failed utterly to see the lights of the \"Cape Breton\" by reason of failure to keep proper look-out and so to appreciate that a vessel was approaching. In fact her pilot Boulle says he saw the red light of the \"Cape Breton\" first when that vessel blew a single blast, and then she was only 700 or 800 feet away. Even then, after an interval of five or six seconds, he blew two whistles and continued on his course. As I have said, notwithstanding this utter failure to obey the rules on the part of those in charge of the \"Canada,\" if those in charge of the \"Cape Breton\" knew or with due care should have known of the change of course of the \"Canada\" and could have prevented the collision by any act on their part, then the judgment must stand. The pilot Hamelin admits that a mile away he saw a flash of a green light indicating, if it continued in view, a crossing vessel, but he swears it was a momentary flash to be expected from an approaching vessel owing to the sinuosity of the river, and that he kept a constant lookout and saw nothing but a red and white light indicating an approaching and passing vessel until, a quarter of a mile away, the vessel suddenly turned in front of him when he signalled he would go still more to the right, assuming the vessel would obey the signal, and to his astonishment she answered she would continue her course, and that instantly he stopped and reversed, but too late to avert the disaster. The trial judge does not expressly find upon this, but indicates his doubts as to whether the green light was not visible for a longer period of approach than I have indicated. Had he found expressly it might have been difficult for the appellants to displace the finding, but, bearing in mind the well-settled principles of law applicable, I think the defendants must be absolved. The fault of the \"Canada\" being obvious and inexcusable, the evidence to establish the fault on the part of the \"Cape Breton\" must be clear and convincing in order to make a case for apportionment, and the burden of proof is upon the \"Canada\" to establish fault in the \"Cape Breton\". The trial judge has not discredited the testimony of those in charge of the \"Cape Breton\"; he relies apparently on an ambiguous entry in the \"log\" and a conversation between the pilot and mate which I think is shewn to have taken place when the first blast was given and not when the green light flashed momentarily in view. I think in view of the findings that the regulation lights of the \"Cape Breton\" were burning, and that she was on her proper course, she was not bound by seeing the momentary flash of the green light to anticipate the conduct of the \"Canada\"; that she took all proper precautions as soon as chargeable with notice of risk of collision and, assuming the learned judge is right, that if she had starboarded her helm the accident might have been avoided (though the weight of evidence seems to me to be the contrary), the pilot exercised the best judgment he could in the agony of collision without violating any express rule, and cannot be held responsible if his judgment erred. The case, I think, is governed by The \"Victory\"[71]; The \"Cula\" v. McMillan[72]; Turret SS. Co. v. Jenks[73], decided in the Privy Council, in 1901. I would allow the appeal with costs in all courts.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I concur for the reasons stated by my brother Nesbitt.\nAppeal allowed with costs*\nSolicitors for the appellants:\nSolicitors for the respondents:\n[1] 9 Ex.

The defendants demurred to the plaintiffs' statement of claim, and, upon hearing arguments upon the demurrer, on the 18th of September, 1905, the judge of the Exchequer Court adjudged that the said demurrer should be disposed of at the trial of the action. The defendants' motion was for leave to appeal from the said order under the provisions of the fifty-second section of the Exchequer Court Act, as amended by the Acts 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 26, there being no evidence that the amount involved exceeded five hundred dollars.\nOrde and Markey for the motion.\nAylen K.C. contra.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014The motion is made by the defendants for leave to appeal from an order of Mr. Justice Burbidge, in the Exchequer Court of Canada, directing that a demurrer of the defendants to the statement of claim should be disposed of at the trial of the action and that the costs of the demurrer should follow the event.\nMr. Aylen, opposing the motion, admitted that the amount in controversy exceeded five hundred dollars, but objected that the order complained of was not a judgment within the meaning of sections 51 and 52 of chapter 16 of 50 & 51 Vict., as amended by 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 26, and 2 Edw. VII. ch. 8, sec 2, and, therefore, was not appealable, even with leave, and he urged the objection as a complete answer to the motion.\nI think the objection is well taken. The enactment, as amended, reads thus:\nAny party to any action * * * who is dissatisfied with any final judgment, or with any judgment upon any demurrer, given therein by the Exchequer Court, may, on taking certain prescribed steps, appeal against such judgment to this court. One of the essential steps, in a case like the present, is obtaining leave of a judge of this court.\nThe order in question is not a judgment upon the demurrer. It is merely a postponement of judgment until the trial. The learned judge has expressed no final opinion on the issues raised by the demurrer. They are still undetermined, and, therefore, there has been no judgment upon the demurrer within the meaning of the statute.\nIf the defendants' contentions were to prevail, then an order of the learned judge postponing the argument for a day, or a week, would also be appealable. I think the judgment meant by the statute is a judgment upon the issues raised by the demurrer. It would be very anomalous that there could be no appeal against any other judgment, unless it were final, and yet, that there could be an appeal from an order, in the case of a demurrer, which had decided nothing whatever.\nThe motion should be refused with costs.\nMotion refused with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Smith, Markey, Montgomery & Skinner.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Lafleur, Macdougall & Macfarlane.\nNote.\u2014The appellants, having taken proceedings for an appeal, de piano, under section 51 of the Exchequer Court Act, the respondents, on 23rd Oct., 1905, moved to quash the appeal for the same reasons as are stated in the foregoing judgment.

(Girouard and Idington JJ. contra).\u2014A recital in the preamble to a special private Act, enacted by the Parliament of Canada, is not such a declaration as that contemplated by sub-section 10(c) of section 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, in order to bring the subject matter of the legislation within the jurisdiction of Parliament.\nA motion made, while the case was standing for judgment, to have the case remitted back to the courts below for the purpose of the adduction of newly-discovered evidence as to the refusal of Parliament to make the above-mentioned declaration was refused with costs. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the decision of Mr. Justice Britton[2], refusing the injunction sought by the plaintiff to restrain the company\u2019s proceedings for the expropriation of certain lands required for their works and dismissing the action with costs.\nThe respondent company was originally incorporated by a special Act, 50 & 51 Vict. ch. 120, under the name of the Canadian Power Company and, by section 29 of that Act, the powers of expropriation mentioned in the \u201cRailway Act\u201d were conferred upon the company. The name of the company was subsequently changed and other powers conferred upon it by the Dominion Statutes, 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 126, 56 Vict. ch. 89, 62 & 63 Vict. ch. 105, 63 & 64 Vict. ch. 113, and 2 Edw. VII. ch. 86. Under the powers so conferred upon them, the company took proceedings for the expropriation of certain lands belonging to the appellant as being necessary for the carrying out of the objects for which they had been incorporated and for the construction of their works in the Village of Chippewa, where they were constructing a canal and hydraulic tunnel. The appellant objected to the expropriation upon the ground that the plan of the respondents\u2019 undertaking upon which the expropriation proceedings were founded shewed a substantially different undertaking from that authorized by Parliament; that the undertaking with which the respondents are actually proceeding is in fact a third undertaking, entirely different both from the undertaking shewn upon the plan and from that authorized by Parliament; that the two undertakings last referred to, for either of which the appellant\u2019s land would alone be required, are abandoned, or at least cannot be proceeded with for an indefinite time; and that, in any event, the undertaking is merely local and private, and not within the authority of the Dominion Parliament, and that power of expropriation in connection therewith could be obtained exclusively from the Provincial Legislature.\nThe case came before Mr. Justice Britton, on a motion by the company for the possession of the lands. The plaintiff had brought his action to restrain the company from proceeding towards the expropriation and notice, on his behalf, had been given for an injunction against the company. By consent of the parties, the motion for possession of the lands was considered as a motion for judgment in the action; a chamber motion for leave to pay the amount of the award was also to be determined. Notice had also been served, pursuant to an order of Mr. Justice Street, upon the Attorneys-General for Canada and for the Province of Ontario, inasmuch as the validity of the Act of 50 & 51 Vict. ch. 120 (D.), and the Acts amending the same were called in question, but neither Attorney-General was represented at the trial.\nThe preamble to the Act of incorporation recited that it was desirable \u201cfor the general advantage of Canada\u201d that a company should be incorporated for the purpose of utilizing the natural water supply of the Niagara and Welland Rivers, and that the contemplated works \u201cwill interfere with the navigation of the Welland River.\u201d The Act then proceeded to incorporate the company with, amongst other powers, those already referred to, but without enacting any clause declaratory of the general advantage of Canada or of any two or more of the provinces through the works or undertakings of the company so incorporated. The Act also authorized the company to enter into contracts extending beyond the limits of Canada. At the trial, Mr. Justice Britton held that the preamble shewed, by implication, the intention of Parliament to give power to deal with matters subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion of Canada and, in connection therewith, to expropriate private property in the Province of Ontario; that this amounted to a Parliamentary declaration that the formation of the company for the purposes mentioned was for \u201cthe general advantage of Canada\u201d[3]. On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, this decision was affirmed[4], and, in delivering the judgment of that court, Mr. Justice Maclennan said:\n\u201cWe are of opinion that this judgment should be affirmed.\n\u201cThe first objection to the power of expropriation claimed by the defendants is that the work authorized by the company\u2019s Acts of incorporation is a purely provincial work and therefore ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament.\n\u201cIt is not necessary that we should say that we agree with all the reasons given by the learned judge for his opinion that this objection is not well founded. It is sufficient to say that the matter is made quite clear by the preamble of the Act, and the power granted to the company by section two, 50 & 51 Vict. ch. 120 (D.), to contract with any bridge company having a bridge across the Niagara River to carry wires across, and to connect with wires of any electric light company or other company in the United States.\n\u201cThe preamble recites that it is desirable for the general advantage of Canada that a company should be incorporated for certain purposes; that certain persons have prayed for incorporation of such a company, and that it is expedient to grant their prayer. And then follow the enacting clauses. We think that recital is clearly a declaration by Parliament that the work which is thereby authorized is a work for the general advantage of Canada within section ninety-two, sub-section 10(c), of the B.N.A. Act. We also think the power granted by section two of the company\u2019s Act above mentioned makes the work authorized a work, or undertaking, extending beyond the limits of the province, within section ninety-two, sub-section 10(a). The work is therefore one excluded from the jurisdiction of the legislature of the province.\n\u201cIt was also objected that the work being constructed by the company is not such as authorized by its Act, because the terminus selected is not that prescribed. \u201cThe canal which is authorized is to extend from some point on the Welland River at or near its conjunction with the Niagara River to a point or points on the west bank of the Niagara River about or south of the Whirlpool. The point selected for the southern terminus is near the falls, which is said to be two and one-half miles south of the Whirlpool, and it is argued that the point so selected is therefore not about or south of the Whirlpool. We cannot say that these words restrict the company to the selection of a point about or near the Whirlpool, or that a point two and one-half miles south of it is not within the language used. So to hold, would be to construe the words as if they had been about and south.\n\u201cIt is further contended that the company is seeking to expropriate a greater width of land than is authorized by the Dominion Railway Act.\n\u201cWe think this objection also fails. By section twenty-nine of the company\u2019s Act, certain sections of the Dominion Railway Act[5], are made applicable to the company, and among others section eight, prescribing the breadth of the land which may be taken without the consent of the owner. That section declares that where the railway is raised more that five feet higher, or cut more that five feet deeper, than the surface of the line, the land taken shall not exceed one hundred yards in breadth. It is sworn that the depth of the company\u2019s canal where it passes through the land in question is more than five feet, the average depth being seventeen and one-half feet, as appears upon the plan and profile filed and approved by the Deputy Minister of Railways and Canals. The width claimed by the company from the plaintiff is one hundred yards, and we think the company is within its rights in making that claim.\n\u201cWe think there is clearly nothing in the objection that the work has been abandoned, for, by the Act 63 & 64 Vict. ch. 113 (D.), the time for the completion of the company\u2019s works was extended for six years from the passing of that Act, that is, from the 7th July, 1900.\u201d\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario affirmed the judgment of Mr. Justice Britton refusing the injunction sought by the plaintiff\u2019s action and dismissing the action with costs. The plaintiff asserts the present appeal.\nThe questions at issue upon the appeal are sufficiently clear from the foregoing statement and the references made in the judgments now reported. Lafleur K.C. and H.S. Osler K.C. for the appellant.\nWalter Cassels K.C. and F.W. Hill for the respondents.\nWhile the case was standing for judgment a motion was made on behalf of the appellant to have the consideration of the appeal discharged and the case remitted back to the Court of Appeal or to the trial court in order that newly discovered evidence might be adduced tending to shew that the Parliament of Canada had, on several occasions, refused to incorporate in the Acts respecting the company any clause or clauses enacting a declaration that the works and undertaking of the company were for the \u201cgeneral advantage of Canada or for the advantage of two or more of the provinces.\u201d\nGlyn Osler appeared for the appellant in support of the motion.\nF.W. Hill, contra, was not called upon for any argument.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The appellant, evidently not expecting a judgment in his favour on his appeal as submitted for consideration in May last, moved the court yesterday for an order\nreferring the case back to the Court of Appeal or to the High Court of Justice to take further evidence as to the refusal of the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada to declare the undertaking and works of the respondent company to be works for the general advantage of Canada.\nThis motion must be dismissed with costs.\nAssuming that the evidence tendered could be legally received, and that the appellant was able to prove the fact that Parliament has refused to specifically declare that the works in question were for the general advantage of Canada, the fact would remain that it has, in fact, repeatedly assumed legislative jurisdiction over them. Now, all presumption being in favour of the constitutionality of such legislation, it must be assumed that, if they have refused to enact a special clause that would unquestionably have given it jurisdiction, and yet continued to exercise that jurisdiction by repeatedly amending the original Act, it was because such a special clause was deemed unnecessary by Parliament itself, either because in the preamble of the Act the motive that induced Parliament to pass it being that the Act was for the general advantage of Canada is an admission amounting to a declaration that it was so, or, because such a declaration was unnecessary, as the Act was one to authorize an interference with the navigation of the Welland River, or because the works were to extend beyond the limits of the province. So that, assuming that the facts alleged in the affidavits filed with the motion are true, they could not in any way affect the result of the appeal.\nThe motion is dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in the judgment dismissing the motion to refer the appeal back in order that some further evidence might be taken on the ground that the evidence proposed to be given is, in my opinion, clearly inadmissible. My reasons for the judgment on the merits are quite outside of and not affected by the evidence sought to be introduced even if admissible.\nGIROUARD and IDINGTON JJ. concurred. The following are the opinions of their Lordships on the merits.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would unhesitatingly dismiss this appeal.\nThe first ground upon which the appellant attempted to support his case is that the Dominion Act incorporating the company respondent, 50 & 51 Vict. ch. 120, is ultra vires and unconstitutional.\nNow, upon him was the burden of establishing the soundness of that contention; the presumption in law always is that the Dominion Parliament does not exceed its powers. The ground upon which he bases his argument on this part of his case is that the Dominion Parliament has not declared this company and its undertaking to be for the general advantage of Canada. But assuming, without deciding, that it has not done so as required by the British North America Act, 1867, it is evident, on the face of the Act of incorporation, that such a declaration was quite unnecessary to give to the federal legislative authority exclusive control over the company.\nThe preamble of the Act alleges that the company\u2019s contemplated works \u201cwill interfere with the navigation of the Welland River.\u201d Now, that was acted upon by Parliament, the petition for incorporation granted, the works authorized, permission granted to interfere under certain conditions with the navigation of the said river, which is proved to be a navigable one, and, by section 32 of the Act, the provisions of the Act respecting certain works over navigable rivers (R.S.C. ch. 92) were extended to the company. Now that the federal Parliament has the exclusive right to so legislate needs no demonstration. The fact that the company may not yet in fact have interfered with the navigation of that river cannot affect the constitutionality of the Act. It had and has yet the power to do so.\nMoreover, by the Act 56 Vict. ch. 89 (D.), amending the company\u2019s charter, the words \u201cor any other wires or cables which the company may lay across the said river,\u201d were added to section 2 thereof, making it clear that the company has the right to lay cables across the boundary line into the United States and to do business therein. Vide Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. The Western Union Telegraph Co.[6] Such a company, with works extending beyond the limits of the province, is not a company with provincial objects. It may, if it pleases, do business only in the United States, not at all in Ontario. And the Ontario legislature could not have given the powers that the federal Parliament has granted them.\nThe other grounds taken by the appellant are frivolous; I am inclined to say as frivolous. The judgments of the two courts below amply demonstrate it.\nThe appeal is unanimously dismissed with costs, as was, by the Ontario Court of Appeal, the appeal from Mr. Justice Britton\u2019s judgment dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons stated by my brother Davies.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Maclennan in the Court of Appeal. DAVIES J.\u2014The chief contention on the part of the appellant was that the charter of the respondent was null and void as not being within the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada and as being a purely local work and undertaking which the Legislature of Ontario could alone authorize.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario held the charter of the respondents to be intra vires of the Dominion Parliament on two grounds: First, that the general recital in the incorporating Act\nthat it was desirable for the general advantage of Canada that a company should be incorporated for the purpose of utilizing the natural water supply of the Niagara and Welland Rivers\nwas a sufficient declaration within sec. 92, sub-sec. 10 (c) of the British North America Act, 1867, and: Secondly, that the power given by section 2 of the company\u2019s charter to connect its wires with the wires of any electric or other company in the United States, made the work one extending beyond the limits of the province and so within sec. 92, sub-sec. 10 (a).\nAs at present advised I do not think the general declaration in the preamble of this private Act such a declaration as that contemplated by sub-sec. 10 (c) of section 92 of the British North America Act, 1867. In my present view of that section I should be inclined to think that with respect to a work or undertaking of a purely provincial kind solely within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislature, and with respect to which Parliament was assuming jurisdiction on the sole ground that the undertaking was for the general advantage of Canada or of two or more of the provinces, the declaration intended was an enacting declaration to the effect required by the Imperial Act. Such a declaration is not, I think, one which might be spelled out of the charter granted or inferred merely from its terms or deduced from recitals of the promoters in the preamble, but one substantially enacted by Parliament. It is not necessary for me, however, to decide the point now, as I hold the charter valid on other grounds and wish to leave the point open.\nThe jurisdiction of the legislature of Ontario is limited to the incorporation of companies with provincial objects only, and such legislature could not confer on a company incorporated by them such extensive powers as are conferred on this respondent company.\nIt is true that the location of the works where the \u201celectric power is to be generated is near Niagara Falls and solely within the province.\u201d But the undertaking of the company is not simply to generate power, but to supply such power\nto manufacturers, corporations and persons for use in manufacturing or any other business or purpose.\nNow the subject matter of the charter is obviously not merely a local one. On the contrary it is obviously one which contemplates extension over large areas. I do not find in the Act any words importing or implying a limitation upon these powers as to area. I should read the second section of the Act as giving powers to extend if found necessary or desirable to any part of Canada which was found practicable. The objects of the company as defined by the Act contemplated, in my opinion, possible extension beyond the limits of one province, and it is therefore just as much within the express exception of the British North America Act, 1867, as a telegraph or telephone company with like powers of extension. City of Toronto v. Bell Telephone Company of Canada[7].\nSuppose a similar charter granted to a company to erect its works on the Ontario side of the Chaudi\u00e8re Falls, at Ottawa, would not the argument that the language of the charter permitted the company to extend its wires for half a mile across the bridge into Hull, in the Province of Quebec, be almost irresistible. Where are the words limiting or preventing such extension to be found? There are clearly no such words while, on the contrary, the general words used fully permit of the extension from one province to another.\nIt is not necessary in an Act of the Parliament of Canada expressly to enact that the company created shall have power to extend its undertaking from the place where its chief works are authorized to be constructed into any other part of Canada. The Parliament of Canada is speaking and, unless there are words of limitation introduced, or the subject matter is obviously of a local or private nature, the language of the statute will be read as applicable to Canada, and not simply to the province in which, such as in this case, the generating works are authorized to be constructed. On the other hand, a provincial charter will be construed as having a provincial limitation, and the legislature will not be presumed to assume jurisdiction beyond the limits of the province.\nThe preamble recites the object of the promoters to be\nthe promoting manufacturing industries and inducing the establishment of manufactories in Canada.\nThe second section, as I read it, not only gives them general and unlimited powers of supplying electric power to parts of Canada beyond the province where their generating works are to be situate, but expressly authorizes them\nto connect with the wires of any company in the United States. Mr. Lafleur felt himself obliged to contend that the local legislature could grant similar powers of connection, and I was disposed at the argument to agree with him. But a closer examination of the clauses of the British North America Act, 1867, has led me to entertain very grave doubts that this is so. It seems clear to me that the legislature could not grant a local company power to connect its wires with those of a local company in any of the other provinces. If it could each company would cease to be one of a \u201clocal or private nature\u201d and become interprovincial and general. How then could the legislature grant power to connect the wires of the company it was creating with those of the companies of a foreign country. The local or private company on such connection taking place would at once cease to be \u201clocal or private\u201d within the British North America Act, 1867, and become international.\nIt was argued that the province has as much right to confer powers beyond its jurisdiction upon the corporations it calls into existence as the Dominion Parliament has beyond Canada. In a certain sense that may be true. But there is a difference and a rational one too. Provincial charters are defined by the British North America Act, 1867, as matters of a local or a private nature not \u201cconnecting the province with any other or others of the provinces,\u201d and \u201cnot extending beyond the limits of the province.\u201d Dominion charters are not controlled by any such statutory limitations, and while the exercise of the powers they confer upon a company of connecting at the international boundary line with the works of a foreign company may be subject to the municipal law of that country and permitted and controlled by the comity of nations, there is no statutory prohibition in the Bri- tish North America Act preventing the granting of the power by the Canadian Parliament to a company it incorporates to connect with a company of the United States at the boundary line.\nIt is not necessary, however, for me to decide whether a grant by the legislature of the province to a company created by it to connect its wires with those of a foreign corporation, at the frontier, would be necessarily beyond its powers or would invalidate the charter altogether or simply in part. That question was not argued excepting incidentally because the validity of a provincial charter was not an issue on this appeal. Whether there exists a concurrent jurisdiction in the Dominion and the province to confer such a power I am not called upon now to decide. I do hold the power to exist in the Dominion Parliament; and that, because of its exercise with respect to this special corporation and also because of the general extent of the powers granted, the Act of incorporation here in question is legal and valid.\nWith respect to the point raised as to whether or not the work under construction is within the Act, I concur with the Court of Appeal.\nMr. Justice Sedgewick desires me to say that he concurs with the foregoing reasons.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014There is undoubted authority for saying that an Act may extend in its operative force and effect beyond the preamble\u2019s statement of fact or purpose inducing the enactment. And it is said that where the preamble is found more extensive than the enacting part it is inefficacious to control the effect of the latter.\nThe preamble has, however, always been a guide to the interpretation of the enacting clauses following it. And the Interpretation Act, by secs. 3 and 4 and sub-sec. 56 of sec. 7, formally declares the relation of the preamble to the clauses following and in the latter section says, that\nthe preamble of every Act shall be deemed a part thereof, intended to assist in explaining the purport and object of the Act.\nIt seems to me that these considerations and declarations cannot be given full force and effect to, in the interpretation of the incorporating Act that created the respondent company, unless we read the preamble thereof as meaning that which begins by say-\nwhereas it is desirable for the general advantage of Canada that a company should be incorporated, etc.\nto be a declaration of the mind of the Parliament of Canada and its purpose in making the enactment. What more can sub-section (c) of sub-section 10 of section 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, require to give it vitality here?\nIs this recital anything else than a declaration of the Parliament of Canada? Its very essence is of that nature.\nIts being by law declared to be a part of the Act, to manifest its purpose, seems to render it impossible to hold it anything else than, or as falling short of, what the creative power of the sub-section (c) requires as a condition preliminary to its exercise.\nThat condition being thus duly complied with, the Parliament of Canada had undoubtedly the power to incorporate, and incidentally thereto to confer on this company so incorporated the fight to expropriate the land in question.\nI do not wish, especially as this suffices for disposing of the appeal, to express or to be held as impliedly expressing an opinion on some of the interesting questions of great constitutional importance that have been considered in the courts below.\nI must add, however, that I see no difficulty in the company\u2019s way by reason of its mode of procedure or alleged expiration of its powers, and on these points I agree with the reasons given in the judgment of Mr. Justice Maclennan.\nI think, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Alexander Fraser.\nSolicitor for the respondents: F.W.

On failure to give security as required the opposition was dismissed, and, on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the judgment dismissing the opposition was affirmed (35 Can. S.C.R. 1). Subsequently the proceedings in execution were continued and, on the eve of the date advertised for the sale by the sheriff, the opposants filed another opposition to secure the same charge, offered to furnish the necessary security, and obtained an order staying the sale. The judgment appealed from maintained a subsequent order made under art. 651 C.P.Q. which revoked the order staying the sale and dismissed the opposition. Held, that, the judgment dismissing the opposition on default to furnish the required security was chose jug\u00e9e against the appellants and deprived them of any right to give such security or. take further proceedings to secure their alleged charge upon the lands under seizure.\nPer TASCHEREAU C.J.\u2014In a case like the present an appeal to the Superior Court of Canada would be quashed, on motion by the respondent, as being taken in bad faith.\nPer GIROUARD J.\u2014As the order by the judge of first instance was made in the exercise of judicial discretion the Supreme Court of Canada, under section twenty-seven of the Act, was deprived of jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's.

The respondents then moved for an order, under art. 651 C.P.Q., revoking the order staying proceedings upon the execution and for the dismissal of the opposition on the grounds that it was irregular, frivolous and made with the object of unjustly retarding the sale. The motion was granted and, on an appeal, the judgment allowing the motion and dismissing the opposition was affirmed.\nR. Taschereau and Desaulniers for the appellants.

The lane in question in the present case bore the number 41, and formed the rear boundary of a lot numbered 47, on the corner of Roy Street and Laval Avenue. On the opposite side it formed the side line of another lot of the same sub-division numbered 40, fronting on Laval Avenue. Subsequently the owners par indivis executed a deed of partition among themselves, by which it was declared that the lanes shewn upon the plan of sub-division should be held in common 'for themselves and their representatives.\nThe defendant acquired lot 47 through the plaintiff, Josephine Gon\u00e9, one of the parties to the deed of partition, \"with the right of passage\" over the lanes bearing the numbers 36 and 41, and proceeded to construct a building on the lot he purchased, with the rear wall on the line of the lane (No. 41), and pierced openings in this wall for doors and windows.\nThe plaintiff, Josephine Gon\u00e9, owner of lot 40, authorized by her husband, then brought an action negatoria servitutis for a decree ordering that the openings in the wall should be closed up. The defendant pleaded that the conveyance of the lot to him with the right of passage over the lanes constituted him the representative of the former owner, and vested in him a right of servitude which entitled him to have doors and windows opening upon the lane as accessory and appurtenant to lot 47 and to the use of the right of passage granted therewith.\nThe plaintiffs' action was dismissed with costs by Mr. Justice Davidson, in the Superior Court, who held that the plaintiff, Josephine Gon\u00e9, had conveyed all accessory rights in respect of the lane (No. 41) when she sold lot 47 to the defendant, and that the rights of view and light possessed by her had vested in the defendant. This judgment was reversed by the judgment now appealed from, which ordered the defendant to close and stop up all the windows and openings made by him in the rear wall of his building, within four months from service of the judgment upon him, and in default of his doing so, that the plaintiffs should have the right to close and stop up the same, with all costs against the defendant.\nMignault K.C. for the appellant.\nAngers K.C., and DeLorimier K.C, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Je suis d'avis de renvoyer l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nLa question soulev\u00e9e me para\u00eet simple.

Clark (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nJohn Docksteader (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1905: October 23, 24; 1905: November 27.\nPresent: Sir Elzear Taschereau C.J. and Girouard, Davies, Idington and Maclennan JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nMining law\u2014Staking claim\u2014Initial post\u2014Occupied ground\u2014Curative provision\u2014R.S.B.C. c. 135, s. 16\u201461 V. c. 33, s. 4 (B.C.).\nIn staking out a claim under the mineral Acts of British Columbia the fact that initial post No. 1 is placed on ground previously granted by the Crown under said Acts does not necessarily invalidate the claim, and sub-sec. (g) of sec. 4 of 61 Viet. ch. 33 amending the \"Mineral Act\" (R.S.B.C. ch. 135) may be relied on to cure the defect. Madden v. Connell (30 Can. S.C.R. 109), distinguished.\nJudgment appealed from (11 B.C. Rep. 37) affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe action was brought by the owner of the \"Colonial\" mining claim to adverse the \"Wild Rose\" claim, owned by the defendant Clark. The trial judge held that the \"Wild Rose\" claim was invalid, and on appeal to the full court and also on the present appeal the only question dealt with was whether or not the \"Colonial\" was a good claim. The objection to the \"Colonial\" was that its initial post No. 1 was placed some 290 feet in on the \"Chicago,\" another claim located and held by grant from the Crown. The trial judge and the Supreme Court of British Columbia held that this was not, under the circumstances, calculated to mislead other prospectors in the vicinity; that the plaintiff had actually discovered mineral in place; and that he had, bon\u00e2 fide, attempted to comply with the provisions of the \"Mineral Act\"; therefore his claim was valid. The defendant then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nW. A. Macdonald K.C. for the appellant. Under the mineral Act of British Columbia the initial post, No. 1, is the root of title to the claim: Madden v. Connell[2] and must be placed on the ground to be located; Madden v. Connell[3] ; Belk v. Meagher[4] .\nThe defect in this case is not a mere formality which can be cured by sub-section (g) of the Act of 1898[5] ; Pellent v. Almoure[6] ; Callanan v. George[7] ; Coplen v. Callahan[8] ; Collom v. Manley[9].\nSub-section (f) of the Act of 1898 provides a means whereby the locator of a fractional claim could make it valid notwithstanding such an error which shews, by implication, that a full claim could not, Expressio unius est exclusio alterius. See Hamilton v. Baker[10].\nS. S. Taylor K.C. for the respondent. The maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius cannot be applied as contended ; see London Joint Stock Bank v. Mayor of London[11] ;Thames Conservators v. Smeed, Dean & Co.[12] ; Broom's Legal Maxims, 493.\nAs to position of the post see Lindley on Mines, (2 ed.) pp. 548-9, 656-8 ; Del Monte Mining Co. v. Last Chance Mining Co.[13] ; Sandberg v. Ferguson[14].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. The finding at the trial, approved of by the court in banco, that the position of the No. 1 post was not calculated to mislead other persons desiring to locate claims in the vicinity cannot be reviewed here, and that puts an end to the controversy. Sub-section (g) of section 16, as amended by the Act of 1898, must be given a liberal interpretation. It applies in express terms to all the preceding provisions of the section.\nI entirely agree with Chief Justice Hunter's reasoning.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed with costs, for the reasons given by Chief Justice Hunter.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed and the judgment of the majority of the Supreme Court of British Columbia affirmed for the reasons stated by the Chief Justice of that court speaking for the majority.\nI will add a few words only to those reasons which commended themselves to my mind as alike comprehensive and conclusive, and I do so only because of the differences in the opinions of the members of this court. The question before us is as to the true construction of sections 12, 15 and 16 of the \"Mineral Act\" of British Columbia, as amended by the Act of 1898, and the particular point we are asked to decide is whether a free-miner in staking his claim under the 16th section invalidates and voids the claim in toto if he inadvertently places its initial stake within the legal bounds of another miner's claim or location, or whether the curative provisions of sub-section (g) of section 16 are applicable and can be invoked even in such a case so as to validate that part or portion of the claim sought to be located which did not infringe upon any other claim.\nThe arguments against the curative section applying to correct an error arising out of an initial stake being placed inadvertently in another claim or location were that such latter claim was expected by section 12 out of the waste lands of the Crown which a free-miner could enter upon and locate, and, therefore, the mining locator could not place his stake there at all, it being \"proscribed land\" to him, that he was really trespassing in so doing, and the provisions of the curative section could only apply to correct inadvertent mistakes in marking out a legal location selected and entirely within the area allowed by section 12.\nReliance was placed upon the case of Madden v. Connell[15], decided before the curative section in question had been introduced into the Act, where it was held that a location which had its No. 1 post on foreign territory is void. I see no reason whatever to call in question that decision or the principle on which it was based. The legislature of British Columbia had no jurisdiction whatever over the lands of a foreign country and none of the provisions of the Mining Act could by any possible intendment be held as applicable to a stake driven in the soil of that country and indicating where a mining location was to be found and bounded in British Columbia. To my mind there is a marked and vital difference between such a stake and one set within the territory generally allocated to mining prospectors in British Columbia, but which on a proper survey of the location turns out to be set within the legal limits of an adjoining prior location; a totally different set of questions at once arises.\nOf course, no one could contend that the setting up of such a stake in an adjoining location operated to take away any of that location from its owner. All that is contended for is that under certain well defined statutory conditions such a placing of the initial stake is not necessarily fatal to the entire claim or location of the miner setting it up.\nThen we were pressed with our decision in Collom v. Manley[16]. The curative section of the Act as it exists at present could not be invoked in that case, because it was not passed until after the disputes there had arisen, and I fail to understand how our decision in that case affects this one. In delivering the judgment of the court, Sedgewick J. explaining what our holdings were in the previous case of Coplen v. Callahan[17] said, at page 374,\u2014\nWe held that every direction of section 16 was imperative, that any deviations from or irregularity in respect to such directions were fatal to the location unless they came within the curative provisions of sub-sec. (g) ; that these were the only statutory provisions that could be invoked in favour of an otherwise invalid location.\nThere is nothing, however, in that case putting any construction upon this curative section or attempting to place any limitation upon its provisions.\nWe have, therefore, now to put a construction upon it for the first time and unfettered by any previous decision.\nTo my mind the argument of the appellant that the placing of the initial post of a location or claim within the limits of a prior location was fatal and could not be cured must logically, under our decision in Collom v. Manley[18], apply also to the second stake, because the placing of one as of the other is by the same section 16 made imperative and the absence of either or the placing of either on \"proscribed lands\" would be equally fatal; and so I am unable to see why the logical conclusion of the argument would not extend to a location sought to be made where both stakes were placed properly enough upon waste lands of the Crown, but the line between the two embraced within it part of a prior location. Such part was equally \"proscribed lands,\" and if the placing of one of the posts in such proscribed lands was fatal so the crossing of such lands by the line between the posts and embracing them within the junior location must be fatal also to that location. The statute requires that such line shall be marked\nso that it shall be distinctly seen in timbered localities by blazing trees and cutting underbrush.\nChief Justice Hunter has, I think, satisfactorily answered the argument that the placing of the initial post in located lands was a trespass. The limited nature of the locator's rights in his location sufficiently shews that. If it was held to be a trespass as against a prior locator, so would be a similar placing of No. 2 post, and so would be the mining and marking out of a line across a prior location, even if the two posts were properly placed.\nIn fact it seems to me that the result of the argument invalidating the entire location in any and every event and condition because the initial post was in a prior location would be so to minimize the effect of the curative sub-section as to render it practically inoperative.\nMr. McDonald, for the appellant, was obliged to concede that even if that post was placed on a prior location with the full consent of its owner, the result would be equally the same.\nNow what does the curative sub-section (g) say? It reads as follows:\nProvided that the failure on the part of the locator of a mineral claim to comply with any of the foregoing provisions of this section, shall not be deemed to invalidate such location, if upon the facts it shall appear that such locator has actually discovered mineral in place on said location, and that there has been on his part a bond fide attempt to comply with the provisions of this Act, and that the non-observance of the formalities hereinbefore referred to is not of a character calculated to mislead other persons desiring to locate claims in the vicinity.\nNow, one of the foregoing provisions of section 16 required both posts, Nos. 1 and 2, to be placed in waste lands of the Crown not previously located. That is the very contention of the appellant as to the meaning of the section, and in the present case one of the posts was admittedly not so placed. But the trial judge has found as facts on evidence which the court below held, and which I hold, as fully satisfactory that\nthe locator had actually discovered mineral in place; and there was a bond fide attempt on his part to comply with the provisions of the Act, and his blunder\u2014if it is a blunder\u2014is not of a character calcu- lated to mislead other persons desiring to locate claims in that vicinity.\nI cannot, therefore, entertain any reasonable doubt that this finding brings the locator within the very object and scope of the sub-section, and that his inadvertent mistake was not, under the circumstances and findings a fatal one, though, of course, it did not and could not operate so as to take away any of the rights of the prior locator.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014If the British Columbia Act, known as \"The Mineral Act,\" had not been amended, since the case of Madden v. Connell[19] arose, would that decision bind us here to allow this appeal?\nThe judgments in this court and in the court below in that case are so brief and pointed that I do not think it difficult to apprehend their meaning.\nThe initial stake in question there had been erroneously planted 289 feet beyond the boundary line between Canada and the United States.\nMr. Justice Martin, in that case, which is reported in 6 British Columbia Reports at page 531, speaking for the full court, said :\nThe Mineral Act of British Columbia does not contemplate the existence of a claim which takes its root, i.e., has its initial post, in a foreign soil, and, as I regard it, the whole situation is void abinitio, or, to put it in another way, there never was in law such a claim as the Sheep Creek Star.\nSir Henry Strong, then Chief Justice of this court, in delivering the unanimous judgment of the court on the appeal from the above mentioned judgment, briefly stated the conclusion, and then said : As Mr. Justice Martin says in giving judgment for the Supreme Court of British Columbia, the position is the same as if there had never been such a claim.\nDid these judicial deliverances rest upon any legal impossibility of going across the line that divides the two countries, to verify the courses and length of boundaries that the claimant of the location had thus mistakenly defined?\nI should think not. Neither international law, nor the relations between the countries at the time, had placed the slightest obstacle in the way of verification of the boundaries of the location, and of rectification thereof, if the mining law of British Columbia had permitted of such rectification.\nIt seems to me that these judgments were the result of a long line of authorities that treated literal compliance with the requirements of the statutes in regard to mining locations as a condition precedent to the validity of any claim to a license to mine in a particular location.\nThe miner locating had no right to invade the territory of another, whether that other happened to be a foreign state, or a neighbouring proprietor, or licensee, for the purpose of either selecting a place to plant, or of planting, an initial stake.\nThe law clearly defined where he had a right to go to do so. It was on the waste lands of the Crown, or lands over which the Crown had a right to license mining to be done.\nIt was never supposed that the free-miner would go elsewhere.\nIt was, indeed, I think, pre-supposed that he would not.\nAnd, as a result, when he did, and invaded, though only slightly, land in a neighbouring state, but yet held by no more sacred rights of ownership than that of any other neighbours, he never acquired, thereby, any right of location.\nIt is upon the principle I thus indicate that I conceive the decision of Madden v. Connell[20] was rested.\nI, therefore, am constrained to hold that having regard to the principle that guided this court to that[21] decision, it is now, here, binding upon us, unless the law has been changed by the amendments that have been so elaborately discussed before us.\nWhat has since been done, is to repeal section 16 of the Mining Act, and substitute for it another which provided, first, for fractional mineral claims, being located, and described, by a plan that need not be rectangular; and then, secondly, at the end of the amended section, the curative provision that still remains part of the section, and to which I will hereafter advert, was added.\nThen the legislature in a year or two, apparently intending to restrict the liberty of description that the preceding amendment had given the free-miner in regard to fractional claims, further amended this section by repealing and substituting an amended section, which directed that\na fractional mineral claim shall be marked by two legal posts placed as near as possible on the line of the previously located mineral claims and shall be numbered 1 and 2, etc., etc.\nThis was a departure that imposed by law upon the free-miner a duty, the proper execution of which involved some risk. If regard was to be had to the recognized legal methods of interpretation, and the same canons of construction were to be applied to these requirements as had hitherto for a long time been applied to such like enactments respecting posts for defining general mining locations, the free-miner should in justice be protected against this risk.\nAnd he was by this amended section protected accordingly by providing for the Gold Commissioner of the District, moving in the case of an honest mistake the post that had been inadvertently placed on another previously located mineral claim, instead of on the line as required by the Act.\nNow, without pressing unduly the application of the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, what does appear to me as very singular is, that if placing posts or selecting a place in which to place posts as means of defining a location is a mere formality, that the curative proviso of this section would be applicable to, why was this particular method of protecting against mistakes honestly made in regard to those posts, locating the fractional mineral claim adopted and specially enacted?\nI am unable to see any good purpose it could serve if the present contention of the respondent be well founded.\nThe curative proviso stood in the section before this amendment.\nIt remained word for word, as much more of the section did, when amended.\nOne thing from this is quite clear, that the legislature did not think lightly of the consequences of invading with such posts the territory of another.\nThe legislature did not see fit to rely on the efficacy of this curative proviso, with serene confidence that it would protect all honest miners who had within the fraction discovered mineral.\nOf course, if the maxim of which so much has been said were to be strictly applied, there would seem to be an end of the respondent's case. But we are trying to get at the meaning of a complicated enactment that was not framed all at one time, but at many times, and, therefore, allowance has to be made in such cases. See remarks of Baron Martin in Miller v. Salomons[22].\nI think we must look at the curative proviso, and interpret it in the light of the history of the legislation in question and of the history of the judicial interpretation of such legislation, the probable wrongs such a proviso was intended to remedy and the measure of protection it probably was designed to give to honest discoverers, and adopt a result if we can that will not be fantastical.\nIt is quite clear that posts properly placed have ever been intended to bind the discoverers as well as protect the prospectors.\nIt is equally clear, that the rigid interpretation of the minor and formal requirements of legislation, in relation to the nature of the post, and the markings thereon and in relation thereto, had harsh and unexpected results, and that a necessity arose for relaxing these.\nIt is not so clear that this relaxation was ever intended to go the length of sweeping away everything but a discovery and honest intent.\nMuch less could it be supposed that the place selected by the miner for his initial stake, which has been properly called the root of his title, might be chosen with impunity and be looked upon entirely as a formality.\nIf that had been the purpose of the legislature I think the whole plan of legislation would have been changed, and the Act recast.\nAnd when we come to read this proviso which is as follows:\nProvided that the failure on the part of the locator of a mineral claim to comply with any of the foregoing provisions of this section shall not be deemed to invalidate such location, if upon the facts it shall appear that such locator has actually discovered mineral in place on said location, and that there has been on his part a bond fide attempt to comply with the provisions of this Act, and that the non-observance of the formalities hereinbefore referred to is not of a character calculated to mislead other persons desiring to locate claims in the vicinity,\nwe must read it as a whole.\nAnd when we do that we must read it as dealing with \"the formalities\" and not with the very essence of the whole work or plan of action.\nIt was never necessary to do so.\nThe miner had ample means of fully protecting himself in making a general mining location.\nThe law provided that prior prospectors should not only erect posts, but also blaze lines or erect posts to mark clearly the ground already taken, so as to clearly distinguish it from the remaining waste lands upon which the newcomers could operate.\nThus the free-miner could, with due care, protect himself, by keeping well within the waste lands and clear of the established lines of prior locations, when selecting the place to plant an initial post; and to the right and left of that selected point, or the line drawn therefrom, he could claim as much as the law allowed him.\nAnd if by chance he overlapped, such overlapping and all else that followed in his work might or might not be of the nature of a \"formality.\"\nIt is to be observed that the discoverers do not rest such claims as are put in issue here, upon a grant from the Crown or any one else. At this stage the claimant prescribes, of his own motion, and to be effective must comply strictly with the requirements of the statute permitting him to prescribe such a right, unless the requirements be clearly qualified by some protecting proviso.\nTo go so far as the respondent asks, in order to protect him, would savour, I venture with due respect to think, of legislation rather than adjudication.\nI think, therefore, the appeal should be allowed with costs, and the declaration be made that Mr. Justice Martin suggests in favour of the \"Wild Rose\" claim.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I am of opinion that the respondent's location is valid and that the judgment in his favour to that effect is right.\nThe contest is between two mineral locations covering in great part the same ground. The respondent's location was made on the 7th of October, 1900, and that of the appellant on the 4th September, 1902. It is not disputed that but for the previous location of the respondent's location called the \"Colonial\" the appellant's location called the \"Wild Rose Fraction,\" would be in all respects valid. The sole question, therefore, is the validity of the \"Colonial.\"\nThe first objection made to the validity of the \"Colonial\" is that when it was located the ground was occupied by a previous location called the \"Cody Fraction.\" The courts below all held unanimously that the \"Cody Fraction\" was and always had been an invalid location, for reasons in which I entirely agree, and that the validity of the \"Colonial\" was not thereby affected. The only serious question in this appeal is whether or not the \"Colonial\" is invalid on the ground that stake No. 1 was placed within the limits of another location called the \"Chicago,\" which had then been surveyed and Crown granted, at a point as much as 290 feet from the boundary; and that the line between stakes No. 1 and No. 2 passed on a part of its course a few feet within the limits of another location called the \"Freddie Lee.\" The \"Colonial,\" as described, is a tract 2,500 feet square, lying to the left of the line drawn between the posts 1 and 2,\u2014that line being one of the sides of the square. According to one of the plans produced, the encroachment of this square upon the \"Chicago\" is in the form of an acute angled triangle containing about 2 1\/2 acres, and the encroachment upon the \"Freddie Lee\" is a long and very narrow strip containing perhaps half or three-quarters of an acre of land.\nNow, there is no question that this encroachment was made in good faith and by inadvertence. The whole location contains 51 1\/2 acres, of which about three acres overlap or encroach upon the \"Chicago\" and \"Freddie Lee,\" and the remaining 48 1\/2 acres are upon perfectly lawful ground. Of course, the respondent could get or take nothing within the limits of the \"Chicago\" and \"Freddie Lee\" locations. Those locations had already been secured by others to whom grants had been made by the Crown. But why should his location not be good for the 48 1\/2 acres? His description covered that perfectly, although it also covered a little more. If the Crown having granted the \"Chicago\" and \"Freddie Lee\" had afterwards granted the \"Colonial\" by the very description adopted by the respondent, there can be no doubt the later grant would be good for all not previously included in the other two. The object of the mining Acts is to promote the discovery of minerals in the lands of the Crown, and an inducement is held out to persons to search for them by enabling them to secure the exclusive possession of ground or rock in which they may have found minerals and to take the minerals for their own use. The essential thing to secure that privilege is the discovery of minerals, and the Act contains certain directions to enable the discoverer to describe and to secure his location, and to obtain the reward offered by the legislature for his industry.\nSuch being the object and purpose of the Act, I think in construing it every reasonable intendment ought to be made to uphold the validity of a claim where there has been actual discovery and an honest attempt to comply with the directions of the legislature in staking and describing the location of the discovery. Except the encroachment on adjacent locations the respondent has complied in every respect with the directions of the Act, and the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia in his judgment has pointed out how difficult it is in a mountainous region to ascertain with exactness the limits of locations, and how easily a person staking a claim might, notwithstanding the greatest care, place his post No. 1 over the boundary of another claim.\nTherefore, unless the Acts contain something which expressly or by implication declares a location to be invalid by reason of such an error as was committed by the respondents, I think we should hold it not to be fatal in this case.\nSection 16 of the \"Mineral Act,\" R.S.B.C. (1897) is that which prescribes the proceedings to be taken on the ground in locating a claim. It directs the planting of two posts 1,500 feet apart, and that the location is to be at right angles to the straight line between them. It directs certain particulars to be inscribed on the respective posts. No. 1, among other things, to be marked \"Initial Post,\" and with a statement of the bearing or direction of post No. 2 therefrom. It is further directed that in the event of its being discovered on a survey that No. 2 is more than 1,500 feet distant from No. 1, it shall be moved to the proper distance. It is declared that it shall not be lawful to move No. 1. It may justly be said, therefore, that post No. 1 is a more important post than No. 2, but granting it to be so, I do not see why if it should happen to be placed a foot or even as many as 290 feet within the boundary of an adjacent claim, it should not still answer its purpose of defining the miner's location. The posts are to be placed as nearly as possible on the line of the ledge or vein of mineral which he has discovered, and, of course, to the extent, if any, that such vein or ledge is upon ground already located his location would be inoperative; but his posts would still serve their purpose of defining the ground which he claimed as the reward of his discovery.\nNow, section 16 instead of containing any declaration that the planting of an initial post beyond the line of another location is illegal and void, contains the following sub-section (g) :\nProvided that the failure on the part of the locator of a mineral claim to comply with any of the foregoing provisions of this section shall not be deemed to invalidate such location, if upon the facts it shall appear that such locator has actually discovered mineral in place on said location, and that there has been on his part a bon\u00e2 fide attempt to comply with the provisions of this Act, and that the non-observance of the formalities hereinbefore referred to is not of a character calculated to mislead other persons desiring to locate claims in the vicinity.\nIt is clear that the conditions which make the pro- viso applicable exist in this case. It is not disputed that the locator had discovered mineral in place on the location, and it is evident that he made a bon\u00e2 fide attempt to comply with the provisions of the Act, and I think that, although the contrary was very strenuously argued, the fault in locating the initial post within the limits of the \"Chicago\" was not calculated to mislead other persons desiring to locate claims in the locality.\nIt was argued that the fault committed by the respondent was a violation of sections 12 and 15, and that violations of those sections are not cured by subsection (g).\nSection 12 provides that a free-miner may enter, locate, prospect and mine upon any waste lands of the Crown with certain exceptions, one of which is \"land lawfully occupied for mining purposes\"; and section 15 provides that such miner may locate a claim 1,500 feet square \"subject to the provisions of the Act.\" Now, what the respondent did was a literal compliance with section 12. He did, in fact, enter upon waste lands of the Crown and found mineral thereon, and the land on which he found mineral was not land then occupied for mining purposes. In making his discovery he had not committed any infraction of either section 12 or section 15. It was not until he came to comply with section 16 by defining and describing his location by marking it with posts that he committed an error. By mistake he planted his initial post outside of the waste lands of the Crown on which he had discovered mineral. That was something he did in endeavouring to comply with section 16, and his mistake, in my judgment, is cured by sub-section (g).\nIt was argued also that this case is governed by that of Connell v. Madden[23], in which the decision of the courts of British Columbia was affirmed in this court. In that case the initial post was planted in the United States at a distance of 289 feet south of the international boundary, and it was held that the claim was thereby made utterly void, and that the position was the same as if there never had been such a claim. The location which was there in question was located in August, 1894, before sub-section (g) was enacted. I think that is a very different case and not decisive of the present. A post planted in a foreign country could be nothing whatever in this country.\nFor these reasons, and those expressed in the opinion of the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia, in which I concur, I am of opinion that the appeal fails and should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

Idington J. dissented though concurring in the judgment on other grounds.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories affirming the decision of Mr. Justice Scott, at the trial, which maintained the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe action was for damages for injury to a number of horses, the property of the plaintiffs, killed or injured by a train operated by the defendants on the line of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway. The band of horses were being driven north from Montana and had arrived, in charge of the drovers, on, the evening of the day of the accident, at a point near Wetaskiwin, in Alberta. The drovers camped for the night and left the horses loose upon the prairie about a mile from the railway. At this point the ditches on both sides of the track were full of water, the line of railway was not fenced and the defendants were under no obligation to build fences enclosing this portion of the line of their railway. During the night the horses strayed on to the tracks of the railway and a train of cars ran into the bunch, killing or injuring over forty head of horses. The train struck the bunch of horses about three miles south of Wetaskiwin, whilst running through a ground-fog which obscured the view of the engine-driver and ran through the herd for a distance of 500 or 600 yards until the engine was derailed at a culvert bridge over which the horses were unable to pass.\nThe trial judge found that the straying animals had got on to the track at a point north of the derailment and had wandered along the track between the ditches until they were crowded together on the track between the flooded ditches and headed off by the culvert. He also found that the moonlight, on the occasion in question, gave sufficient light to enable the engineman to see the horses a quarter of a mile ahead, and that the train could have been stopped within a distance of one hundred yards; that the engine-driver had not kept a continuous lookout ahead; that there was a heavy fog on the prairie, and that simultaneously with the engine entering the fog-bank it struck the horses.\nThe learned judge held that the engine-driver could, by reasonable and ordinary care, have seen the horses and stopped the train in time to avoid injury, and that he was guilty of negligence\" either in not keeping a proper look-out ahead of his engine, or in not stopping the train in time to prevent the injury.\" He also held that at the time of the accident the horses were trespassers upon the railway property, but that the injuries were due to the negligence of the railway company's engine-driver and a verdict was entered for the plaintiffs. This decision was affirmed upon appeal, Wetmore and Prendergast JJ. dissenting.\nG. Tate Blackstock K.C. for the appellants.\nC. de W. Macdonald, for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014We are all of opinion that this appeal should he allowed with costs and the action dismissed with costs. Mr. Justice Maclennan has written the opinion of the majority of the court.\nGirouard and Davies J J. concurred in the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Maclennan.\nIdington J.\u2014I concur, in the result of the opinion of my brother Maclennan. I desire, however, with great respect, to say that I am unable to assent to the proposition that seems implied therein, that until aware of the presence of animals on the railway track the company could not have any duty in respect to them.\nThe probabilities of meeting trespassers on the track might be so well known to a railway company and its servants as to render it their duty to keep some look-out or take some degree of care. To limit the duty to trespassers, to cases of actual knowledge of their being in the act of trespassing, narrows the definition too much I conceive.\nBird v. Holbrook ([1]) illustrates the principle that I think should prevail in many conceivable cases of trespassers. MACLENNAN J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nI think the case is very fully and fairly discussed by Mr. Justice Wetmore in his dissenting judgment in the court below and, agreeing as I do in that judgment, I do not think it necessary to add many observations to what he has well said.\nI think the law is well settled that, the plaintiffs' animals having been wrongfully on the track, no duty rested upon the defendants or their engineer until they or he became aware of their presence. In other words, the company is not obliged, as between them and such wrongdoers, to be on the look-out for such animals. They may assume that owners of animals will observe the law and will not trespass upon the company's line.\nThe learned trial judge's finding on the evidence is that the engineer, by exercising only reasonable and ordinary care, might have seen the horses on the track in time to stop the train to avoid injuring them, and that he was guilty of negligence, either in not keeping a proper look-out ahead of his engine, or in not stopping the train in time to prevent injury. On this dilemma he founds his judgment against the defendants. He does not say on which ground of negligence he rests it. If on the first it would be clearly wrong, and he has not found as a fact that, after seeing the animals, he was guilty of delay in stopping the train.\nIn that state of the findings of the learned trial judge it was competent to the appellate court to form its own opinion on the facts.\nUnfortunately the majority of the Supreme Court of the Territories rests its judgment mainly on the same erroneous view of the law taken by the trial judge, and without finding whether or not, as a fact upon the evidence, there was negligence after discovery by the engineer that the animals were on the track.\nThe learned judge goes on to say that, however the law might be in England or the Eastern provinces on the duty of railway companies expecting and looking out for animals on their tracks, such a rule might not be applicable to the conditions of the territories where horses have the right to, and do, roam at large. No attempt was made to uphold that view of the law before us.\nUnder these circumstances, none of the witnesses having been discredited by the trial judge, it was competent to the Supreme Court of the Territories, as it is competent to us, to take an independent view of the evidence and the inferences to be drawn there from. That being so, after a perusal of the evidence, I think the preferable view is that of Mr. Justice Wetmore, that it is not sufficiently proved that after he had become aware of the presence of the animals the engineer was guilty of any negligence in stopping the train in order to prevent doing them injury.\nNor am I pressed, by the number of the animals killed, even to suspect undue delay on the part of the engineer. The whole herd contained 227 animals, besides sucking colts. Having got on the track between two ditches full of water, they naturally formed a large group, or \"bunch,\" as it was called by the witnesses, in front of the engine, there being an impassable culvert in front of them. Under these circumstances, it does not seem to me surprising that one out of every five of the whole herd was injured.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs. Appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants; Lougheed & Bennett.\nSolicitors for the respondents; Macdonald & Griesbach.\n[1] 4 Bing. 628.\n",

Duncan (Receiver) Respondent.\n1905: October 27; 1905: November 27.\nPRESENT:\u2014Sir Elz\u00e9ar Taschereau C.J. and Girouard, Davies, Idington and Maclennan JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE NORTH-WEST TERRITORIES.\nReceiver\u2014Management of business\u2014Supervision and control\u2014Laches.\nThe receiver of a partnership who is directed by the court to manage the business until it can be sold should exercise the same reasonable care, oversight and control over it as an ordinary man would give to his own business, and if he fails to do so he must make good any loss resulting from his negligence.\nThe fact that the receiver is the sheriff of the district does not absolve him from this obligation though the partners consented to his appointment knowing that he would not be able to manage the business in person.\nThe Chief Justice and Maclennan J. dissented, taking a different view of the evidence.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories affirming, by an equal division of opinion, the judgment of Mr. Justice Newlands, who granted the application of the receiver to be discharged.\nThe plaintiff (appellant) and the defendant were in partnership, at Francis, as hotelkeepers, and the former brought an action against the latter for dis- solution of the partnership, an account, and the appointment of a receiver. By an order made by Mr. Justice Newlands, with the consent of the interested parties, bearing date the 4th day of July, 1904, the respondent, Duncan, who is the sheriff of the Western Assiniboia Judicial District, was appointed as such receiver to collect, get in, and receive the debts and other assets, property, and effects belonging to the partnership business carried on by the plaintiff and the defendant, Diemert, and to carry on and manage the said hotel business at Francis.\nThe respondent entered into possession of the hotel business and put one Neil N. McLean in charge to manage the same. The parties to the action settled it, and the receiver proceeded to have his accounts as such passed. Upon the passing of the accounts it appeared that the management of the hotel business by the receiver had not proved financially successful, and that there was a deficit of $1,367.16. The plaintiff and the defendant, who appeared by counsel on the passing of the receiver's accounts before Mr. Justice Newlands, claimed that the deficit was due to the neglect of his duties by the receiver and that the latter should be held responsible for and charged with this deficit.\nOn the 29th March, 1905, Mr. Justice Newlands gave judgment, holding that the receiver was not responsible for the deficit above referred to, and further that he, the receiver, was entitled to be indemnified by the parties to the suit against all debts incurred by him during the time that he was in charge of the business. The ground on which this judgment was based was that both parties assented to the appointment, knowing that the sheriff could not attend personally to the business, and that he visited the hotel and examined affairs there as often as his official duties permitted. Both parties appealed to the court en banc.\nThe Supreme Court of the North-West Territories, en banc, was evenly divided, Chief Justice Sifton and Mr. Justice Harvey agreeing with the judgment appealed from, while Mr. Justice Wetmore and Mr. Justice Prendergast were of opinion that the judgment of Mr. Justice Newlands should be reversed. In the result, the appeal was dismissed and from that decision the present appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was taken.\nOn the appeal being called,\nChrysler K.C., for the respondent, moved w quash on several grounds, namely, that the decision appealed from was not a final judgment in the action to dissolve the partnership, that it was a matter for the discretion of the provincial courts, that it was a domestic matter to be dealt with by the courts below, and that the formal orders of Mr. Justice Newlands and the court en banc were not in the printed case. The court ordered the hearing to proceed on the merits, reserving judgment on the motion.\nEwart K.C., for the appellant.\nChrysler K.C., for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014In this case the majority of the court have come to the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the court of appeal and the receiver and manager be declared liable for and charged with the deficit of $1,367.16, and that he should be ordered to deliver up possession at once of the partnership estate and effects which came to his hands by virtue of the order of the court of 4th July, 1904, and thereupon should be discharged.\nI cannot concur in that judgment and would dismiss the appeal. Mr. Justice Maclennan has written a dissenting opinion in that sense in which I concur.\nThe respondent's motion to quash is dismissed with costs, as we intimated at the hearing. There is no room for doubting our jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This was an application by the receiver and manager of an insolvent estate for the passing of his accounts as filed. The court made a declaration that he should not be held liable for a deficit which the accounts shewed during the management of the estate by him and that he should retain possession of the property until the plaintiff's creditor paid over to him the amount of this deficit, $1,367.16.\nThis judgment was maintained by a majority of the court of appeal.\nAt the hearing counsel for the plaintiff (appellant) contended that the liability of the receiver and manager should not only be declared to cover the deficit, but that it should also extend to such profits in addition as should have been made by the business if it had been reasonably and properly managed.\nWe are now relieved from giving consideration to this latter contention because counsel consent that judgment should be given on the assumption that no such profits were actually proved in this case, and the question before us is therefore reduced to one of the liability of the receiver and manager for the actual deficit which occurred during his management, namely, $1,367.16.\nI concur generally in the judgment given by Wetmore J. and concurred in by Prendergast J. as to the responsibility of a receiver and manager of a business entrusted to his care.\nThe deficit in this manager's accounts was, in my judgment, shewn to be the direct result of his wilful default in leaving the business for months together to take care of itself without his own or any other supervision or control. No accounts were apparently kept, by the person appointed to manage the hotel, with the hotel guests or lodgers or generally of the hotel business. No attempt was made to keep separate the receipts from the lodgers or guests at the hotel and those from the casual patrons of the eating room. In fact all receipts were supposed to have been put in the bar-room till or money register. Even the hotel register which might have aided in ascertaining the times during which the several boarders lodged at the hotel was not forthcoming. The hotel manager was called to explain the accounts and generally to account if possible for the deficit. His explanations such as they were only served to make matters look worse than they did on the face of the accounts and deservedly called down upon the witness a severe rebuke from the trial judge for the manner in which he was giving his evidence. My only surprise is that under the circumstances as stated in the evidence the deficit was so small.\nIf under such circumstances as those described in this case a paid receiver and manager of a business is not to be held liable for the deficit in his accounts I do not know under what circumstances he should be. Surely it is not necessary to prove personal wrongdoing or peculation on his part in order to make such liability attach. Creditors of an estate, the running business of which is placed by a court in the hands of a receiver and manager, are entitled to exact from him such reasonable care, supervision and control as an ordinary man would give to the business were it his own. The trust was voluntarily accepted by the receiver and manager. The fact that he was also sheriff did not absolve him from the ordinary responsibilities of a position of trust which he chose to accept. He continued the business for about five months, for the three latter of which he neither gave any personal attention to it nor took any steps to preserve a business supervision or control over it. No accounts were rendered during this time shewing how the business was progressing nor did the manager cause any inspection whatever of it. The natural results of such culpable negligence ensued. The man in charge handed in certain moneys and substantially said, there is a deficit but I can give no explanations. It is said, however, that the onus rests upon the creditors to prove how the loss occurred and to shew that it was caused by the direct action or default of the receiver and manager. I do not think so. Surely every intendment must be made against a trustee or manager presenting accounts such as those in this case, and asking that they be passed and he discharged. Reasonable care and ordinary business control and oversight are required from the receiver and manager. If he brings them to the discharge of his duties he may well claim to be absolved from losses which nevertheless occurred. If he fails to do so he cannot complain if he is held answerable for losses which are the legi- timate result of his negligence, and which, in my opinion, the evidence shews the $l,367.16 loss was.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the court of appeal and the receiver and manager be declared liable for and charged with the deficit of $1,367.16, and he should be ordered to deliver up possession at once of the partnership estate and effects which came to his hands by virtue of the order of the court of 4th July, 1904, and thereupon should be discharged.\nIDINGTON J. concurred in the reasons stated by Davies J.\nMACLENNAN J. (dissenting).\u2014After a careful perusal of the evidence in this case I am unable to see that we ought to interfere with the judgment.\nThe appellants have tried out their case to the best of their ability, and have adduced all their evidence; but I think it amounts to no more than a strong suspicion that money may have been received which has not been accounted for, or that goods may have been given away without payment, or without a proper price having been charged and collected therefore, or that McLean may have received some money which he has not paid over to the receiver. But mere suspicion, however strong, will not do. I do not find that there is any particular sum, large or small, which was, or ought to have been received, but not accounted for. Without that, how is it possible to charge the receiver with any such sums? That difficulty was seen by the learned dissenting judges; and what they do is to express an opinion that the matter should be tried again, that it should be referred to the clerk, or some other officer, to take an account of what the profits of managing the business should be without any negligence on the part of the receiver. But that is the very thing which has already been done, and in which the plaintiffs have failed. They do not pretend that they have discovered any new evidence, and I see no ground on which the case should be sent back for a new trial as suggested by the learned judges.\nMcLean ought no doubt to have kept more exact accounts, and the receiver failed to exercise all the supervision which his duty required. But I think it is not proved that any specific sums were lost, or not accounted for, with which the receiver ought to be, but has not been charged. If that had been done the learned judge would have charged the receiver with them. If he had omitted to do so that could be corrected on this appeal. But the evidence is no more than general evidence of mismanagement, without proving the loss of any sum or sums of money resulting therefrom.\nThe learned judge might have deprived the receiver of his remuneration, but he has not done so, and I do not understand that the appellants ask for that.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant; Johnston & Ross.\nSolicitors for the respondent; Balfour & Martin.\n",

The release executed shall be made to include and free and discharge both the parties hereto from all and further liability to the claimant.\n\"Any loss or damage to person or property on the trains of either of the parties hereto which may be caused in any manner whatever by the negligence or the fault of any person or persons in the joint employ of the parties hereto while in the working of said railway hereby demised or the terminals thereof, shall be paid by the party upon whose train such loss or damage occurs, and such party shall save the other harmless and indemnify the other from all claims, costs, or proceedings for or in respect to such loss or damage.\n\"The superintendent, operators, despatchers, agents, and all others employed upon the repairs and maintenance and in the operation of the said joint sections, though paid by the Grand Trunk Railway in the first place, shall be considered as, and are in fact, in the joint employ of the parties hereto in reference to any question of liability of either party hereto to the other party for their negligence, and in reference to any and all other questions; and they shall render to each party such services as they may be called upon to render within the scope of their position or employment, and shall be subject to dismissal if they decline, neglect or refuse to render such assistance and service to either party hereto as such employees are usually called upon to render.\n\"Each of the parties hereto assumes all responsibility for the accidents or casualties upon, or to its own trains, and to its passengers, freight and employees, by reason of any imperfection of the track, or misplacement of switches by its own employee or a joint employee or strangers, or for damages for stock killed, or injury that may occur to persons walking upon the track or at highway crossings (if any liability therefor), or from any other cause (aside from or except collision, in any form, with the trains of the other party, or negligence of an exclusive employee of the other party) and no such accident or casualty shall give either party the right of action or claim against the other party, it being the intention and design that each party shall be responsible for its own trains, for the conduct of its own and joint employees as respect such trains, freight, passengers and employees, and generally, except when the other party or its employees are at fault.\"\nThe plaintiffs, admitting that the deceased were not in the company's service but were employees of the Crown, alleged that the deceased persons and the trains which collided were under the control of the company and its employees, for whom it was responsible, and that such employees negligently directed or allowed the trains to run in opposite directions on a single track of the railway, and thus caused the accident.\nSir Melbourne Tait, Acting Chief Justice, in delivering the judgment appealed from, referred to the facts in evidence as follows:\n\"An examination of the proof shews that the collision was due to the neglect of G. D. Stinson, then train despatcher at Bonaventure Station. When the west-bound train, drawn by engine No. 61, was reported to him at Ste. Rosalie, he issued to this train running orders to St. Hubert, but failed to provide for a crossing point between it and the east-bound train, drawn by locomotive No. 209, which had orders to run to Ste. Rosalie. The result of this neglect was that the two trains collided at about two and a half miles from Ste. Madeleine, at about 5.45 a.m.\n\"At the time of the accident the movements of the different trains between Montreal and Ste. Rosalie were under the control of Mr. Stinson, who had to provide crossing places for those running in opposite directions, without regard to which company owned the trains or by which company the employees thereon were engaged.\n\"Without going into the question how far, if at all. Stinson was subject to the direct orders of the officials of the Intercolonial Railway, the evidence shews that he was selected, engaged and paid by the company defendant, and that in the performance of his duties he was governed by certain time tables, rules and regulations supplied him by that company, that he was also subject to orders of the chief despatcher, and that the whole despatchers' department was under the general superintendence of Mr. Blaiklock, the company defendants' superintendent of the Eastern division of its railway, which included within its limits the line between Montreal and Ste. Rosalie. He appointed and discharged train despatchers, and kept a record of their conduct while in the company's employ.\n\"Under the agreement, Stinson was in the joint employ of the parties thereto. He was a train despatcher at a terminal (Bonaventure Station). In section 8, despatchers are declared to be in fact in such joint employ, and by section 19 the Crown agrees to pay a share of his salary to the company defendant.\n\"The learned judge, in his judgment, refers to sections 11 and 20, and holds that the control of the movement of engines, vehicles and trains of the Intercolonial Railway, while on the portion of the line called in the agreement the \"Montreal Joint Section,\" was vested in the company defendant to be governed by the time-tables prepared by said company, its reasonable regulations and the direction of its officials; and that the two trains, at the time of the accident, were under the agreement, and as a matter of fact, under the control of defendant company exercised through Stinson; that he was employed by the company and committed the fault which caused the collision while in the performance of the work for which he was so employed, and that the company was responsible for his fault., and that plaintiff, as a third party, was not affected by the clauses of the agreement which did not exempt it from responsibility towards her. The inscription in law was maintained in part with costs against defendant, and it was condemned to pay plaintiff $ 3,000 for damages without any costs.\n\"I concur in this judgment.\n\"The grounds urged against it by the company defendant in its factum (and it cannot be heard upon any other) are first, that it cannot be held responsible for damages caused by the negligence of those who were operating the trains of its lessee the Intercolonial Railway; that no liability arises from the fact that the accident occurred on Grand Trunk Railway territory, for a lessor is not responsible for an act of negligence made by his tenant on the leased premises; that the tenant is in no sense the agent of the landlord; in support of this, the case of Keiffer v. Le S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec([2]), is cited; and secondly, that the company defendant cannot be held liable for the negligence of despatches Stinson, who was a joint employee, because, when he, as such joint employee, was despatching Intercolonial trains, lie was, in fact and in law, the servant of that railway and not the company defendants', and that his negligence in despatching two Intercolonial Railway trains without providing a meeting place, can create no liability on the part of the company defendant.\n\"The company defendant also states in its factum that it does not invoke the agreement against third parties as being binding upon them. It asserts that it refers to it to ascertain what was in effect the position of the particular individual whose negligence caused the accident; that the question of fact must be determined by the court before any legal inferences can be drawn and the agreement between the lessor and lessee as to the joint employment of this individual is one of the facts which can only be determined by reference to the contract.\n\"Accepting the statement that Stinson was the joint employee of the parties, we can eliminate the first ground of defendants' appeal, and come down to the question whether both parties are not jointly and severally responsible for his fault. I think they are. This results from arts. 1054 and 1106 CO., the latter of which says that the obligation arising from the common offence or quasi-offence of two or more persons is joint and several. Pothier, from whom this is taken, says (Obligations, No. 453):\n\" 'Ce n'est pas seulement en contractant, que les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s obligent leurs commettants. Quiconque a commis quelqu'un \u00e0 quelques fonctions, est responsable des d\u00e9lits et quasi-d\u00e9lits que son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 a commis dans l'exercise des fonctions auxquelles il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9pos\u00e9, et s'ils sont plusieurs qui l'ont pr\u00e9pos\u00e9, ils en sont tous tenus solidairement sans aucune \u2022 exception de division ni de discussion.'\n\"Such joint and several responsibility towards third parties appears to have been contemplated by the agreement, and especially by the second part of section 7, which we are unanimous to confirm with costs.\"\nLafleur K.C. and Beckett for the appellants. The respondent cannot be held responsible for damage caused by the negligence of those who were operating the trains of its lessee, the Intercolonial Railway. No liability arises from the fact that the accident occurred on Grand Trunk territory. A lessor is not responsible for an act of negligence committed by his tenant on the leased premises. The tenant is in no sense an agent of the landlord: Kieffer v. Le S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec ([3]).\nThe respondent cannot be held liable because the accident occurred through the negligence of the despatcher Stinson, who was a joint employee. When he was despatching Intercolonial trains he was in fact and in law the servant of the Intercolonial Railway and in no sense the servant of the Grand Trunk Railway Company. Consequently, his negligence in despatching the two Intercolonial trains can create no liability on the part of the Grand Trunk Railway Company. The general superintendent of the eastern division of defendants' railway, and the chief despatcher, who appointed and discharged train despatches and kept a record of their conduct while in the company's employ, were also joint employees within the meaning of the agreement.\nWhatever might be the effect of section 20 of the agreement, as to the Grand Trunk Railway Company exercising a certain control over the joint staff, in a case which was covered by its terms, it has clearly no application to a despatcher who was not an official or employee of the Intercolonial Railway on board either of the trains. The section in terms refers only to the staff by which the Intercolonial trains are manned.\nThe appellants do not invoke the agreement as binding on persons not parties to the contract. But appellants refer to that contract to ascertain what was in fact the position of the particular individual whose negligence caused the accident. The question of fact must be determined before legal inferences can be drawn, and the agreement between the lessor and the lessee as to a joint employment of this individual is one of the facts which can only be determined by reference to the contract.\nThe cases referred to in art. 1106, C.C., and in Pothier, \"Obligations,\" No. 453, are those in which several masters employ a common servant to do the same work, but the principles do not apply to cases where the same servant may be performing distinct and separate duties for different employers.\nLastly, as to the fact that the despatchers were chosen and paid by the defendants, no inference can be drawn that, quoad the particular service which Stinson was rendering at the time, i.e., despatching the two Intercolonial Railway trains, he was, for that purpose, anything but an employee of the Crown. It is of no consequence through whom Stinson may have been paid his wages because the agreement provided that joint employees should be paid through the Grand Trunk Railway Company, the Intercolonial Railway contributing its proportion for the services rendered to it. The selection of the despatcher by the Grand Trunk Railway Company cannot change the position as it does not distinguish the present case from those in which a general servant is loaned or hired by his master to others. In all cases it is implied that the general employer has himself selected his servant but that the servant ceases to be his servant in respect of any particular work which is performed by that servant for another master.\nLaflamme and W. G. Mitchell, for the respondents. The train despatcher whose negligence caused the accident was, at the time, in the service of the appellants; he had been hired and was paid by them; he was, while performing his duties, governed by the rules, regulations and time-tables issued by them and by the instructions of their superintendent and chief despatcher.\nThe evidence conclusively shews that the appellants had and exercised the entire and exclusive control over the movements of both Grand Trunk and Intercolonial trains on this section of their railway, while the Intercolonial Railway authorities exercised no control over the movements of their trains on that section, apart from preparing the schedules of regular trains and fixing the number of extra trains. The Intercolonial Railway authorities exercised no control whatever over the despatchers' department, or the crossing points. The despatchers follow the Intercolonial Railway schedule in the case of regular trains, but, in the case of extra trains, such as those which collided, the instructions of the despatcher guide altogether.\nAppellants are not relieved from responsibility. under the circumstances, by the effect of statute 62 & 63 Vict. ch. 5 (D.), confirming the agreement of the 1st of February, 1898, because, as control is the foundation of responsibility, where there is control there is also responsibility, if fault be proved. The allegations of joint employment, joint control and joint ownership set up in the plea are not, properly speaking, allegations of fact, but depend entirely upon an interpretation erroneously placed upon the agreement and the statute. The plaintiffs cannot be in any manner bound or affected by this agreement to which they were neither parties nor privies. Under the circumstances proved, even this agreement, by its terms, would not relieve the defendants of their responsibility for the injuries resulting from their negligence. See art. 1106, C.C.; Duquette v. Pesant dit Sans-Cartier([4]); Jeannotte v. Couillard([5]); Paquet v. Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec([6]); Rancour v. Hunt([7]).\nIt is recognized jurisprudence that where a railway company grants running powers over its line to another railway company the owner, particularly when controlling the operation and movements of trains, remains responsible for collisions. 23 Am. & Eng. Encycl. of Law (2 ed.), p. 733, par. 6; p. 784, par. 6; pp. 785, 786, 730, and p. 731, sub-par. b of par. 3.\nThe decision in the case of Kieffer v. Le S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec([8]), has no application. There the act of negligence was that of the lessee; in the present case the act of negligence is that of the lessor.\nDelisle K.C. held a watching brief on behalf of the Attorney-General for Canada.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014At the conclusion of the argument in these cases I was inclined to think that there was nothing in the appellant's contentions, but, after consideration, I am not so sure of it. I find, however, that the majority of the court have agreed to dismiss the appeals. The nature of the cases is such that I would not feel justified in delaying the judgments in that sense which are now ready to be given. I concur dubitante.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Cette cause ne souffre aucune difficult\u00e9. L'appel doit \u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens pour les raisons donn\u00e9es par Sir M. M. Tait, A.C.J. DAVIES J.\u2014These appeals present the same facts, were argued together and are to be determined by the same considerations and principles.\nI do not think the agreement between the Grand Trunk Railway Company and the Government as to the running rights which the Intercolonial Railway should have over the road can prevail to relieve the Grand Trunk Railway Company, the owner of the road, from its responsibility for the accident which resulted in the damage to the several respondents. It was the negligence of an employee of the Grand Trunk Railway Company which caused the accident, an employee selected, engaged and paid by them. The special work in which this employee was engaged had reference to the operation of the railroad as a whole, and was not confined to the running of the Intercolonial Railway trains over the road. We are not called upon to express any opinion as to the liability of the Intercolonial Railway to the plaintiff respondents, either jointly with the Grand Trunk Railway Company, or separately from them, and I expressly refrain from touching upon that point. Whether, under the running agreement between the Crown and the company, there is any right or remedy over, by the Grand Trunk Railway Company against the Intercolonial Railway, is a question not before us and which I decline to consider.\nOnce it is determined, as I think it was here rightly determined, that the negligence which caused the disaster was that of a Grand Trunk Railway employee in the discharge of his ordinary and general duties, the liability of that railway company to the injured plaintiffs is fixed.\nThe appeals should be dismissed with costs in each case. IDINGTON J.\u2014These two cases turn upon the question of the liability of the appellants for the negligence of a train dispatcher, hired by the defendants, now appellants, pursuant to the agreement between them and Her late Majesty, represented by the Honourable the Minister of Railways and Canals of Canada.\nThis agreement provided for the running of Intercolonial Railway trains over part of the appellants' track. It purports to lease thereby to the Crown, but provides in fact for a joint use of appellants' property.\nThe agreement was confirmed by 62 & 63 Vict. ch. 5 (D.), and appears in full, with that Act, in the Dominion statutes.\nThe negligence of the train despatcher resulted in two of the Intercolonial trains colliding on this track of the appellants used under the said agreement by the servants of the Crown in running Intercolonial trains in connection with that railway system.\nThis collision resulted in the death of engineer and fireman on one of these trains.\nIt was found by the learned trial judge and upheld by the Superior Court (in review) at Montreal that the appellants were liable and judgment was entered accordingly.\nFrom this latter judgment the appeal is taken, and it is urged by the appellants that inasmuch as the train despatcher was engaged at the time solely in the directing of Intercolonial trains and, by the agreement in question, the agents of the Crown had some right to object to the employment by appellants of such officers, and the Crown had become bound to indemnify the appellants in such cases, and as they allege, also assumed the burthen of accidents on the Intercolonial trains, the Crown must be liable, if any-one be liable, for the damages in question.\nI am unable to take that view of the matter. The appellants had the right to hire, and to discharge, and, possibly, a right of interference in the directing of some trains which the Crown had not.\nI think we must hold this train despatcher to have been the servant of the company.\nArticle 1054 of the Civil Code seems identical with what I take the English law to be on the subject of the master's liability.\nThere may be some difference between the effect of art. 1106 C.C., and the English law, as to a several liability in some such cases, but not in a way to touch this case.\nThe kernel of the matter is very much like that involved in the cases of Laugher v. Pointer ([9]) and Quarman v. Burnett ([10]), of which the first named gave rise to much difference of judicial opinion.\nHaving regard to the almost exclusive right to hire enjoyed by the appellants and the payment of the salaries by them to the despatchers they might hire, and also to the right of selection of the appellants' superintendent of their Eastern division, who was also the superior officer of those despatchers, and to the fact that he had been engaged and paid by the appellants in the same way as the despatchers (in almost every respect), I think it must be held that the appellants were, at the time of the accident in question, the masters who must answer for the negligence of this culpable despatcher, whose neglect caused the deaths in question.\nThe contract between the owners of these two railway systems provides, by clause 8 thereof, as follows:\nThe superintendent, operators, despatchers, agents and all others employed upon the repairs and maintenance and in the operation of the said joint sections, though paid by the Grand Trunk Railway in the first place, shall be considered as, and are in fact, in the joint employ of the parties hereto in reference to any question of liability of either party hereto to the other party for their negligence, and in reference to any and all other questions; and they shall render to each party such services as they may be called upon to render within -, the scope of their position or employment, and shall be subject to dismissal if they decline, neglect or refuse to render such assistance and service to either party hereto as such employees are usually called upon to render.\nI am unable to understand how this can in this case help the appellants. It only shifts the point of view and seems to constitute both parties masters of the despatchers. They may, as suggested in the court below, be jointly liable. If joint masters and jointly liable, the effect of art. 1106 of the Civil Code, which governs this contract, is to render them severally liable and thus remove a difficulty possible to arise under English law but not in this case upon this Code.\nIn arranging time-tables and the running of extra trains it might be urged from the general scope of the contract that the appellants have the right of precedence in saying what should be done, though, it is true, bound to concede to the other party what may be reasonable in that regard.\nThe provisions of the contract for indemnity also point rather in the same direction.\nThese suggestions of precedence and the effect of the indemnity clauses are only such and are not to be taken as final opinions or even the important basis upon which my opinion rests here.\nThe contract in question is one that presents many sides and possible room for many distinctions in cases that may arise upon it.\nI think the appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I am clearly of opinion that these appeals fail.\nThe simple question is, whose servant the train despatches by whose fault the accident occurred, was. He was employed by the appellants, was responsible to them alone for the performance of his duties, and they alone were responsible to him for his wages. It is plain that if his wages were not paid any action he could bring must be against the appellants alone and, in like manner, they alone could sue him for any fault in the performance of his duties.\nI do not see how any agreement between the appellants and the Crown could give the latter any right of action against the despatcher.\nBesides, even if both the appellants and the Crown were liable, it seems to be plain that, by Quebec law, the liability would be several, as well as joint, in a case like the present.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants : A.

The action was to compel the defendants to establish and maintain a farm crossing for the use of the plaintiff in passing from one part of his farm to another where it was intersected by the railway and to recover fifty dollars damages occasioned by the defendants' refusal to furnish the crossing when required to do so. The principal defence was that the court had no jurisdiction to make any order as prayed for since the enactment of the \"Railway Act, 1903,\" vesting the exclusive jurisdiction in regard to such matters in the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada. The action was dismissed in the Superior Court, where Mr. Justice Carroll held that the jurisdiction to make such orders had been taken away from the courts and vested solely in the Board of Railway Commissioners. His decision was reversed by the judgment now. appealed from on the ground that the plaintiff, by law and by the special Act incorporating the company (16 Vict. ch. 37), as well as by the general railway Acts in force at the time of the construction of the railway, was entitled to have the farm crossing as demanded by his action.\nLafleur K.C. and P. H. Cot\u00e9 K.C. for the appellants (Beckett with them). The present appeal affects the lands of the railway and a servitude asserted in relation thereto by the plaintiff and, consequently, is of the class of cases in which an appeal will lie to this court. We refer to Chamberland v. Fortier([1]); McGoey. v. Leamy([2]); and the established jurisprudence of the court under numerous decisions since the reports mentioned.\nThe express provisions of the \"Railway Act, 1903,\" vesting plenary and exclusive jurisdiction in all matters such as those now in question in the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada have the effect of ousting the jurisdiction of courts of law or equity: Cates v. Knight ([3]); Breakey v. Carter ([4]); Mayor of Montreal v. Drummond(3[5], at p. 412; The Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway Go. v. The Atlantic and North-West Railway Go. ([6]); Ontario Lands and Oil Go. v. Canada Southern Railway Go. ([7]); Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Northern Pacific & Manitoba Railway Co. ([8]); Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McKay ([9]).\nThe special statutes affecting the Grand Trunk Railway impose no greater liability as to crossings that can be required under the general railway Acts: Y\u00e9zina v. The Queen([10]); Guay v. The Queen([11]); Grand Trunk Railway Go. v. Therrien ([12]).\nBeaudin K.C. and J. E. Perrault, for the respondent. The respondent asks the construction of a crossing with two gates to communicate from one part to the other of his farm, the cost of which would not exceed one hundred dollars, as shewn by the affidavits filed and also $50 damages. Consequently, the total amount of his claim is $150, and is not sufficient to give this court jurisdiction to hear an appeal. The case does not come within the class of cases in which appeals from the Province of Quebec are permitted by the Supreme Court Act: Cully v.Ferdais([13]);arts. 1209, 1211, C.P.Q.; Desaulniers v.Payette([14]); Shaw v. St Louis ([15]). Under the Acts, 16 Vict. ch. 37, sec. 2, and 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 51, sec. 13, the appellants are bound to establish and maintain the farm crossing as required by the plaintiff. The right accrued over fifty years ago, when the railway was constructed, and the \"Railway Act, 1903\" cannot operate retrospectively to take away that right: Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Huard ([16]). Under the special Act incorporating the Grand Trunk Railway Co., as well as under the general Acts concerning railways, the Superior Court has always had, and still has, jurisdiction to enforce the rights of individuals under what may be termed the statutory contract. This court, in the case of the Canada Southern Railway Go. v. Clouse ([17]), did not entertain any doubt as to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court. See per Gwynne J. at page 157; Canada Southern Railway Co. v. Erwin ([18]). In the case of the Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Therrien ([19]); the question as to the right to a crossing was decided on the merits, this court admitting, implicitly, that it had jurisdiction over the case. See also Dubuc v. Compagnie du Chemin de Fer de Montr\u00e9al et Sorel([20]); Smith v. Atlantic and North-West Railway Co. ([21]).\nSection 23 of the Railway Act does not give to the Board more power than the Railway Committee had under the Act of 1888. The Railway Committee, under that Act, had the same jurisdiction as the present Board, nevertheless the courts heard cases similar to the present one and have always declared that they were competent to do so. The \"Railway Act, 1903,\" has not created a new recourse, nor a special tribunal, applicable to this case, inasmuch as the recourse of the respondent existed long before the passing of that Act.\nParliament could not take away the jurisdiction of the Superior Court except by an express enactment absolutely clear and positive: Vide Lord Kenyon C.J., and Ashurst J., in Gates v. Knight ([22]); Ashurst J., in Shipman v. Henbest([23]); Loranger, Commentaire du Code Civil, vol. 1, p. 140, No. 25; Ramsay J., in Grenier v. City of Montreal ([24]); Hardcastle (3 ed.), at p. 133; Balfour v. Malcolm([25]); Endlich, Interpretation of Statutes, p. 736, No. 522. The \"Railway Act, 1903,\" does not contain any text expressly taking away the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, nor which necessarily implies that it has not jurisdiction over a case like the present one. Section 198 speaks of farm crossings, but it does not give any exclusive power to the Commissioners. The Board has the power to act if application is made to it, but there is no obligation to have recourse to the Commissioners. The Commissioners can act only at the instance of the proprietor. In the present case the proprietor brought suit before the Superior Court. He has chosen his tribunal; he could not go before the Commissioners and make the same demand, and, under section 198, the appellants could not do so because the Commissioners can act only upon the request of the owner of the land.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014Mr. Justice Davies has written in this case an opinion in which I fully concur that the appeal should be allowed.\nMr. Justice Carroll's reasoning in the Superior Court, I may add, is conclusive, and his judgment, reversed by the Court of Appeal, is restored, with costs in all the courts against the respondent. An application to quash made by the respondent at the hearing-must be dismissed. Our jurisdiction to entertain the appeal is incontrovertible. The action is unfounded in law, and dismissed for that reason.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014 Whatever doubt might exist under prior railway Acts, none is possible under the Act of 1903, sec. 42. I entirely agree with my brother Davies.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The judgment appealed from in this case determined that the plaintiff's right to a farm crossing on the appellants' railway, which ran through his farm, did not arise under the \"Railway Act\" of 1888, or that of 1903, but was a right which was created and existed under the original Act of Incorporation of the Grand Trunk Railway Company. Trenholme J., who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, says:\nIt is, therefore, in virtue of the original Act of Incorporation of the Grand Trunk Railway Company that appellant, as owner of a farm severed by respondent's railway, is entitled to a crossing in the present case.\nThat being so, the court held that jurisdiction of the ordinary courts to give effect to plaintiff's right had not been taken away by the general \"Railway Act\" of 1903, and they accordingly reversed the judgment of the Superior Court at Arthabaska, which had dismissed plaintiff's action, declared the plaintiff entitled to the crossing he demanded, and ordered the same accordingly with the necessary subsidiary orders to make their judgment effective. The judgment proceeded upon the ground that the court was bound by its judgment in a previous case of Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Huard, rendered in June,\n1892([26]),\nbased on the same statutes as are applicable in the present case (and which they held to be a) direct authority for our course in this case both in declaring appellant's right to a farm crossing and in ordering it.\nI am of opinion that the judgment appealed from is erroneous and that the old charter of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, to which the court of appeal refers, does not confer any such right upon the plaintiff to a farm crossing.\nThe question was discussed at great length in this court in the cases of V\u00e9zina v. The Queen([27]), and Quay v. The Queen([28]).\nThe meaning of sections identically worded as that upon which the court of appeal decided in this case were there considered and determined. This court there held that these statutes (that is, the Consolidated Railway Act prior to 1888) did not give a right of crossing over the railway apart from contract. This same conclusion was re-affirmed in the case of Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Therrien ([29]). By these decisions we are bound and, as far as I am concerned, I may say I fully concur in them.\nThe only statutory right, therefore, to a crossing which the plaintiff has is that conferred by the railway Acts of 1888 and 1903. The question then arises whether the enforcement of this right is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nI am of opinion that it is. In the case of Grand Trunk Railway Go. v. McKay (I), we had occasion to consider the question of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Railway Commissioners with respect to the speed of trains when crossing highways at level crossings through thickly populated parts of cities, towns and villages, and with respect to the safeguards which in such cases should be maintained for the safety of the travelling public. In that case we reached the conclusion that the jurisdiction of the Railway Commissioners in the section there in controversy was exclusive, and, from the very nature of the case, was in-tended by Parliament to be so. My reasons for judgment in that case were expressly concurred in by the Chief Justice and Killam J., and were substantially those advanced by Sedgewick J. On that point there was no difference of opinion, Girouard J. basing his dissenting opinion upon other grounds.\nI feel it, therefore, unnecessary to repeat at length this reasoning. It is true the special section relating to crossings, 198 of the Act of 1903, was not before us in the case of Grand Trunk Railway Go. v. McKay ([30]), but, in my judgment, the same reasoning which led this court to the conclusion that the jurisdiction of the Railway Commissioners was exclusive with respect to the sections of the Act involved in that case, applies to this section 198 of the Act of 1903. The sub-section of that section says:\nThe Board may upon the application of any land-owner order the company to provide and construct a suitable farm crossing across the railway wherever in any case the Board deems it necessary for the proper enjoyment of his land on either side of the railway and safe in the public interest; and may order and direct how, when and where, by whom and upon what terms and conditions such farm crossing shall be constructed and maintained. We are not now dealing with a common law right or with an antecedent vested statutory right, but with a right of crossing created by the section itself, of which I have quoted the sub-section. The crossing is to be given\nwherever in any case the Board deems it necessary for the proper enjoyment of his land * * * and safe in the public interest.\nMany considerations have to be weighed in reaching a conclusion under this section, and some of them relating to the \"public interest\" may be quite apart from the immediate surroundings. What weight, if an ordinary court was considering the question, would they give or have a right to give to the \"public interest?\" The special Board of Commissioners is enjoined to consider what would be safe in the public interest. The ordinary court is not so enjoined, and I know not on what ground but one of statutory injunction they would be justified in such a matter as farm crossings in considering the safety of the general public. These considerations on which alone its judgment would be based would, I should imagine, be limited to the rights and interests of the land-owner on the one side and the railway company on the other.\nThen consider what an extraordinary jumble might and probably would arise if two courts proceeding on different considerations reached opposite conclusions. Section 3 of section 42 enacts explicitly that\nthe finding or determination of the Board upon any question of fact within its jurisdiction shall be binding and conclusive on all courts.\nSo that, if there existed concurrent jurisdiction, the exercise by the Board of its powers must override and control, so far as facts are concerned, any conclusions of other courts. If, as I have stated, the considerations the conflicting courts were to consider were necessarily different the result would be startling.\nI am of opinion that this is a case of a statute giving a right and prescribing a mode of giving effect to it, and looking at the whole Act and especially at sections 24, 42 and 198, I entertain no doubt that the jurisdiction conferred on the Board by the latter section was intended to be exclusive.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Superior Court restored with costs in all the courts.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent claims a farm crossing but fails to establish exactly when the appellants built their road over which he seeks a crossing.\nHad he shewn that it was before the time when the statute was changed by substituting \"at\" for \"and\" in 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 51, sec. 13, as explained by 20 Vict. ch. 35, I would have been prepared to consider the meaning of the statute before that change.\nI do not think the change was merely the immaterial one it has been represented to be. In the evidence that is now before us such loose expressions as that the road was built \"about fifty years ago\" do not warrant me in considering the respondent's rights, if any, as having arisen under the earlier law, especially so when this evidence is only given by a man of forty-three years of age. The respondents can, therefore, if at all, only claim such rights as may have accrued since the change of words to which I have adverted.\nThis court has by the cases of v\u00e9zina v. The Queen ([31]), and Guay v. The Queen([32]), put upon \"The Government Railways Act,\" R.S.C. ch. 38, secs. 16, 17, 18 and 19, which are to me not distinguishable from Consolidated Statutes of Canada, ch. 66, secs. 13, 14, 15, and 16, in regard to the question of farm crossings, an interpretation that precludes us now from holding that any right to a farm crossing, save by contract or possibly by way of necessity, could arise or exist in consequence of anything done, from the time of the coming into force of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada to the passing of the \"Railway Act\" of 1888.\nIt seems to me that Huard v. The Grand Trunk Railway Go. ([33]), relied upon in the court below, may have been rightly decided if the right arose before the Act was amended in consolidating the statutes in 1859, but otherwise the decision would seem to be inconsistent with the principle affirmed in the decisions of this court above referred to.\nIt does not get over the difficulty these cases have created to refer to them as decisions upon another statute, when that other statute has for its aim the creation of exactly the same sort of right or regulating power, and uses almost identical words with that of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, ch. 66.\nFor a period of twenty-nine years the railway companies and land-owners accommodated their relations in regard to crossing rights, without the law creating a right thereto, as it turns out, but probably in light of the decisions of the Ontario and Quebec courts, as if the law had imposed the duty upon the railway company to furnish a crossing where needed.\nThen, about the time the question of the crossings arose in the cases, referred to, as decided by this court, the \"Railway Act\" of 1888 was passed, whether in consequence of the doubt which had arisen in these particular cases or generally, in previous litigation, does not appear.\nThe decisions were not given until 1889. The cases were pending in March, 1888. The enactment of section 191, in the Act of 1888, and section 198 in the \"Railway Act, 1903,\" providing for farm crossings becomes in the light of this history of the question most perplexing.\nIs it remedial legislation? Is it declaratory? Is it to apply to the cases where the railway had been constructed at any time antecedent to such enactment? Assume that, and it might, if taken absolutely so, and in the widest sense, apply to cases where the railway company may have compensated in full for the damages that severance of the land produced, or in respect of which they may have contracted to be freed from the burthen of making and maintaining a crossing.\nOn the other hand, confine the operation of either provision to the cases of future railway building and for that purpose future expropriations, and the numerous cases that the past railroad construction, and legal uncertainty, have no doubt given rise to, are then left quite unprovided for, and the land-owners unprotected, though all parties may have proceeded upon the supposition that the law already provided what these cases decide it had not.\nThere is no provision in the \"Railway Act\" of 1888 for damages. In the \"Railway Act\" of 1903, there is by section 294 the express recognition of such a right. I am of the opinion that this case falls under the latter Act, and that such a right of action exists here, and that the solution of this case and the questions it raises is, as to damages, an action upon the statute; and as to the specific relief of ordering a crossing the provision of the statute confers the right and the remedy given therefor must be followed.\nWe are not embarrassed by the question of the company's acquisition of the title in the road allowance, as was the case in Ontario Lands and Oil Go. v. Canada Southern Railway Go.([34]).\nWe have, however, before upholding the claim for damages here or indeed any right in the respondent, to meet the question of what is meant by the words \"across whose lands the railway is carried\" in section 198.\nThey are quite comprehensive enough to cover such a case as the title here. More apt words could easily have been selected for the purpose, I assume, of giving a remedy retrospectively, where the rights of the parties depend on such facts as found here.\nI go no further. Each way one looks at this section of the statute difficulties are presented, and some of them most formidable. When, however, we look at the purview of the Act I cannot think it was intended to cut off the claims of those who had, without any fault of theirs, lost in law, without compensation, such rights of crossing as both they and the railway company, I have no doubt, until the decision I refer to, conceived there existed.\nIt is to be observed that this legislation was also probably meant to deal with the cases of sub-divisions, not within the probable consideration of either party when a railway was built.\nTo meet that phase of farm crossings the whole question of granting or refusing is remitted to the discretion of the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nThat is not all that is remitted to that tribunal to dispose of in the case of farm crossings. I venture to think that so much is, and if so, why should the whole field of such crossings whether arising from future railway building or future sub-divisions of lands, or the cases arising out of past railway building not also be provided for?\nIt seems when these questions are all borne in mind that we must conclude they were all present to the mind of Parliament, and the result was the use of words capable of furnishing a remedy for each and every case so arising.\nIt would seem as if the question of the jurisdiction of the superior courts having been taken away or not, has, though the contest throughout has been in regard to that, never in law arisen. It never existed, except as to damages.\nIt follows that this case has been throughout contested on an entirely erroneous basis.\nI cannot accede to the proposition put before us that the right created by this legislation is one of a conditional character, only to come into effect upon the granting or issuing of an order by the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nThe right may be limited by the discretion of the Commissioners, in some of the many kinds of cases that are sure to arise.\nIt seems to me, however, that the companies cannot safely assume, and ought not to act upon the assumption in all cases, that until an order is got no right exists, and especially ought not to do so on such facts as this case presents.\nI am of opinion that the judgment, directing a crossing to be made, must be set aside, and the application for an order be left to the authority appointed by this Act, that created the right to grant it, and the manner of its performance or execution. This is one of the cases, however, in which the granting of the order might also be said to be administrative so clear does the right seem to be. The appellants are liable, in my view, for damages for failing to observe the statutory duty created by sub-section 1 of section 198 of the \"Railway Act\" of 1903. If authority be needed section 294 of this Act seems clear. And it is equally clear to me that the first sub-section creates a right here quite independently of the second sub-section.\nThe demand was made for a crossing. It might have been made in better form. Nothing was done. No explanation is offered by the defendants. It certainly ought not, I think, to be laid down as law that before the land-owner, who is given this statutory right, can hope to enjoy it he must, in every case, simple or complex, alike institute proceedings that the railway company ought to help to avoid. And especially so in such a case as this where years ago they had recognized the right and duty. I think in the result that each party should pay his own costs of appeal to this court and the costs in the Court of Appeal below, and that the judgment in the trial court should be with such costs as the amount of damages will carry.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I concur for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Davies.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants : P.

The debtor may accept the assignee as creditor and the institution of the action is sufficient notice of such acceptance. The Bank of Toronto v. The St. Lawrence Fire Insurance Go. ([1903] A.C. 59) followed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Richelieu, which dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs. In 1894, the City of Sorel passed a by-law to aid the construction of a railway from Longueil, opposite Montreal, to Levis, opposite Quebec, on the south side of the River St. Lawrence. The by-law granted a bonus of $50,000 to a syndicate then promoting a company for the construction of the railway and was subject, amongst others, to the conditions that the railway company should bridge the Richelieu River within the city limits; erect workshops in the city for the construction and repair of their rolling stock; construct and operate lines of railway between Sorel, Verch\u00e8res, Nicolet and Levis, with special reduced rates of fare upon accommodation trains running into Sorel every Saturday, and take their supply of water and gas at Sorel from the city works at rates specified. It was provided that all these conditions should be fulfilled and that the workshops should be constructed, equipped with the necessary tools and machinery and be in operation within three years from the date of the by-law, otherwise that the by-law should lapse and become void and that all sums payable thereunder should be forfeited.\nThe rights of the syndicate were assigned to the South Shore Railway Company, which subsequently sold and assigned them to the defendants, but the notice of such assignment was never served upon the city as required by art. 1571 of the Civil Code.\nAfter a portion of the construction of the railway into Sorel had been completed and put in operation, in 1896, one-half of the bonus was paid by the city, but the railway was never completed or operated as contemplated; a blacksmith's shop with an anvil, a forge and three workmen was established instead of general railway workshops and, finally, the railway company became insolvent and discontinued the operation of the railway. The city instituted an action, in 1904, to set aside the by-law for default in the fulfilment of the resolutory conditions to which it was subject, and to have a declaration discharging it from all liability as to the unpaid portion of the bonus, and further reserving its rights as to recovering back the portion of the bonus, $25,000, which had been advanced to the company in 1896.\nThe plaintiff's action was dismissed at the trial and the judgment appealed from affirmed this decision, although differing somewhat from the reasons given in the court of first instance.\nThe material questions at issue upon the present appeal are discussed in the judgment of His Lordship the Chief Justice now reported.\nBeaudin K.C. and Belcourt K.C., for the appellant.\nB\u00e9ique E.G. and Robertson, for the respondents.\nLE JUGE EN CHEF.\u2014Le 3 Mars, 1904, la cit\u00e9 de Sorel instituait contre la compagnie intim\u00e9e une action dont le rejet par la cour sup\u00e9rieure et par la cour du banc du roi a donn\u00e9 lieu au pr\u00e9sent appel.\nPar sa d\u00e9claration elle demandait d'\u00eatre relev\u00e9e d'une obligation de $25,000 qu'elle a contract\u00e9e en 1894, en aide d'un certain chemin de fer, express\u00e9ment sous certaines conditions r\u00e9solutoires, qui n'ayant pas, d'apr\u00e8s elle, \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies par l'intim\u00e9e ou ses auteurs, lui donnent le droit de demander l'annulation de la dite obligation dont l'intim\u00e9e est maintenant porteur.\nDeux questions pr\u00e9liminaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 l'audition. La premi\u00e8re est que, d'apr\u00e8s les all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de l'appelante elle-m\u00eame, il appara\u00eet qu'elle n'a pas droit maintenant \u00e0 ses conclusions, parce que, dit l'intim\u00e9e, ces $25,000 n'\u00e9tant pas encore exigibles, elle ne peut demander d'avance l'annulation d'une obligation \u00e0 laquelle il est possible qu'elle ne soit jamais tenue. Cette objection, maintenue par la cour sup\u00e9rieure, a \u00e9t\u00e9 justement \u00e9cart\u00e9e par la cour d'appel. Ces $25,000 sont au passif de l'appelante et diminuent d'autant son cr\u00e9dit et son pouvoir d'emprunter, limit\u00e9 par sa charte \u00e0 20% de la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re imposable par elle.\nUne seconde objection de l'intim\u00e9e contre l'action de l'appelante est qu'il n'existe aucun lien de droit entre elle et l'appelante, parce que, dit-elle, la vente et cession \u00e0 elle du chemin de fer et des $25,000 en question, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelante. Cette objection n'a pas non plus pr\u00e9valu devant la cour d'appel, et ne le devait pas. D'abord, l'appelante, par son action, reconna\u00eet et accepte l'intim\u00e9e comme sa cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re. C'est bien l\u00e0 accepter, comme il lui \u00e9tait parfaitement loisible de ce faire par son action, la cession \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e des $25,000. Bank of Toronto v. The St. Lawrence Fire Insurance Co.([1]). Et l'intim\u00e9e ne peut aucunement s'en plaindre. Elle excipe, par cette objection, du droit d'autrui. Puis, si elle d\u00e9sirait avoir le vendeur de l'intim\u00e9e en cause, elle n'avait qu'\u00e0 ce faire elle-m\u00eame. Et, en supposant qu'un jugement dans l'instance soit d\u00e9fectueux ou ineffectif parce qu'il ne serait pas chose jug\u00e9e avec les auteurs de l'intim\u00e9e, c'est l'appelante qui en souffrira, non l'intim\u00e9e.\nMaintenant tant qu'au m\u00e9rite m\u00eame du litige. L'action de l'appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9bout\u00e9e par la cour sup\u00e9rieure principalement sur le motif que la r\u00e9solution de droit sous-entendue dans tout contrat ne pourrait avoir application dans l'esp\u00e8ce parce qu'il y a eu de part et d'autre un accomplissement partiel des obligations r\u00e9ciproquement contract\u00e9es et qu'il est impossible de remettre les parties dans l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient avant 1894. Il y avait l\u00e0 erreur. C'\u00e9tait perdre de vue, et la cour d'appel l'a justement remarqu\u00e9, que par une clause expresse du contrat entre les parties, il est stipul\u00e9 que si les ateliers ou usines de la compagnie\nne sont pas construits, outill\u00e9s et en op\u00e9ration dans les trois ans de l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de ce r\u00e8glement, alors et dans ce dernier cas, icelui r\u00e8glement deviendra caduc et aucune partie du bonus dont l'octroi est contempl\u00e9 ne sera payable en vertu d'icelui.\nLe jugement de la cour d'appel, confirmant le dispositif de celui de la cour sup\u00e9rieure, rejette l'action sur le motif que la preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas qu'il y ait eu par l'intim\u00e9e ou ses auteurs une violation suffisante de leurs obligations pour entrainer la caducit\u00e9 du bonus en question. Nous ne pouvons en venir \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion.\nIl nous semble \u00e9vident que l'intim\u00e9e, en face de la preuve, ne peut pas soutenir qu'elle a raisonnablement rempli ses obligations. Elle semble croire que l'appelante n'a pas droit \u00e0 ses conclusions parce qu'elle n'a pas proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de suite en 1897 \u00e0 demander la r\u00e9solution du contrat d\u00e8s qu'elle, l'intim\u00e9e et ses auteurs, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 en d\u00e9faut. C'est l\u00e0, tout en admettant ses fautes, se plaindre de ce que l'appelante lui a accord\u00e9 un trop long d\u00e9lai pour remplir ses engagements et lui reprocher de ne pas avoir exerc\u00e9 son droit d'action avant 1901. Et cependant, elle a sp\u00e9cialement plaid\u00e9 que l'action est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e. Il faudrait, d'apr\u00e8s elle, que l'appelante lui paie ces $25,000, puis prenne une action pour s'en faire rembourser. Cette pr\u00e9tention, surtout de la part d'une compagnie insolvable, ne peut pr\u00e9valoir. Si l'appelante aurait droit de les recouvrer, les e\u00fbt-elle pay\u00e9es, elle doit avoir le droit de demander d'\u00eatre relev\u00e9e de l'obligation de les payer sans avoir \u00e0 attendre pour ce faire dix, vingt ou cinquante ans au gr\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e.\nC'\u00e9tait \u00e0 condition d'avoir le chemin de fer autoris\u00e9 par le statut, 57 Vict. ch. 72 (Que.), c'est-\u00e0-dire, un chemin de fer construit et compl\u00e9t\u00e9 dans cinq ans, que l'appelante a consenti \u00e0 souscrire ces $25,000. Elle ne l'a jamais eu. Et tant qu'\u00e0 son engagement d'avoir \u00e0 Sorel des ateliers outill\u00e9s et en op\u00e9ration dans les trois ans du contrat, elle s'en est moqu\u00e9e comme des autres. La preuve d\u00e9montre que durant sept ans elle n'a eu l\u00e0 qu'une enclume, une forge et trois ouvriers. M\u00eame depuis l'institution de l'action, toutes les r\u00e9parations importantes sont faites ailleurs parce que, dit son propre surintendant, \"la shop n'est pas suffisamment outill\u00e9e.\"\nOr, quand elle s'est oblig\u00e9e d'avoir ses ateliers outill\u00e9s et en op\u00e9ration dans trois ans, ce\u00e7i doit s'entendre \"suffisamment outill\u00e9s\" pour toutes les fins du chemin de fer afin d'avantager la population de Sorel en compensation du bonus souscrit pour eux par l'appelante. D\u00e9s 1897 l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait d\u00e9chue du droit de reclamer ces 25,000. Or, rien depuis l'a relev\u00e9e de cette d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance.\nTant qu'\u00e0 la construction du chemin jusqu'\u00e0 Nicolet et le d\u00e9faut de tenir la partie construite en op\u00e9ration, le fait admis qu'elle est en faillite et dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 de remplir aucun de ses engagements envers l'appelante serait suffisant \u00e0 lui seul pour faire maintenir l'action s'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'appelante de l'invoquer. Arts. 1082, 1092 C.C.\nL'appel est maintenu avec d\u00e9pens dans toutes les cours contre l'intim\u00e9e, l'action de l'appelante maintenue et le r\u00e8glement No. 218 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 caduc et annul\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit tant qu'\u00e0 cette partie d'icelui concernant les $25,000, et l'appelante d\u00e9charg\u00e9e de 46\u00bd payer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e ou \u00e0 ses ayants cause ces $25,000 contempl\u00e9s par le dit r\u00e8glement.\nGirouard J.\u2014Cet appel doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9. Les contribuables de Sorel ont vot\u00e9 un bonus de $50,000 pour la construction d'un chemin de fer qui a pass\u00e9 entre les mains de l'intim\u00e9e.

Le fait que la ville de Sorel a pay\u00e9 la moiti\u00e9 du bonus avant l'expiration des trois ans, ou qu'elle a attendu longtemps, avant de porter cette action ou de se plaindre, n'est d'aucune importance.

P. Q.\u2014Evidence\u2014Judgment secundum allegata et probata\u2014 Ultra petita-Surprise\nIn an action for revendication of books, documents and records retained by a fire insurance agent after his dismissal and for damages in default of delivery thereof, several policy copybooks, which could not be found at the time of the seizure, were delivered up in a mutilated condition by the defendant during the pendency of. the action, the defendant being unaware of such mutilation. Some time afterwards the answers to defendant's pleas were filed and contained no reference to the mutilated and incomplete condition in which these books were returned. At the trial plaintiffs were allowed to give evidence as to the cost of replacing these books in proper condition, although defendant objected to the adduction of such proof, and the trial court judge assessed damages in this respect at $200, and at $2000 in respect of certain mutilated plans, at the same time declaring the revendication valid, etc. On appeal by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, reversing the trial court judgment in regard to the pecuniary condemnation:\u2014\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from, that, as the defendant had been surprised, in so far as the issues affecting the policy copy books were concerned, he was entitled to relief as to the item of $200 \"for damages in respect thereof. With regard to the item of $2000 damages, however, as the defendant could not have been taken by surprise, he himself having mutilated the plans, the Supreme Court of Canada reversed the judgment appealed from and restored the trial court judgment as to that item of the damages assessed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, reversing, in part, the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, by which the plaintiffs' action had been maintained with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions in issue on this appeal are stated in the judgment of the court delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard.\nMartin K. C. and Beaudin K. C. for the appellants.\nKavanagh K. C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGIROUARD J.\u2014This appeal involves merely a question of local practice.\nIn 1900 the appellants caused to be issued a writ of revendication to seize and attach in the hands of the respondent all the books, documents and records of the company and, among others, copies or records of all policies issued by him and also all maps, whether issued by Goad or others, which they alleged to be illegally detained by the respondent, who for several years had been their chief agent in the Province of Quebec but had recently been dismissed from office.\nBy the conclusions of their demand, they pray first that the said seizure be declared good and valid, that they be declared proprietors of the said books, documents and records and that the respondent be ordered to give up the possession of the same to the appellants forthwith; and finally,\nthat in the event of the said defendant having secreted or made away with the said books, papers and documents or any part or portion thereof, which are the property of the said plaintiffs, and to the possession of which they are entitled, that he be adjudged and condemned to pay plaintiffs the value of the same, to wit, the sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the said plaintiffs expressly reserving all their rights and recourse against the said defendant for any and all damages suffered and sustained or which may hereafter be suffered and sustained by them by reason of the failure and refusal of the said defendant to hand over to said plaintiffs the said books, papers and documents the whole with costs. The trial judge maintained the saisie revendication and in this respect his judgment was confirmed by the Court of Appeal. The respondent not having appealed from this judgment it is chose jug\u00e9e between the parties, and its soundness cannot be questioned before this court, as contended for by the respondent.\nThe difficulty before us turns upon a point of practice which arose at the trial when the witnesses were examined. The plaintiffs proved first that eighteen policy copy books\u2014which could not be found when the seizure was made, but had been delivered up, pending the case, in January, 1901, and also the Goad plans which although seized were not delivered till November, 1901, under a judgment of the court\u2014 had been returned in a mutilated and incomplete condition, some 500 slips or wordings having been torn out of the policy copy books and numerous pencil memoranda and notes having been erased from the Goad plans, which slips and memoranda were proved to be very valuable and indispensable in the conduct of their insurance business. Next, the plaintiffs endeavoured to establish and did establish that it would cost $2,000 to replace the Goad maps and $200 to replace the slips in the policy copy books.\nThe respondent objected to this evidence but the trial judge (Lavergne J.) allowed it and on the 19th January, 1903, he delivered the following judgment upon this branch of the case:\u2014\nConsidering that even at the time of the attachment the defendant had secreted part of plaintiffs' property to wit, eighteen policy copy books, and had even destroyed, by erasing it, all information inscribed on Goad's plans;\nConsidering that on the 14th of January, 1901, defendant was not in a position to and did not deliver up to plaintiffs all the property claimed and of which the plaintiffs were the lawful owners;\nConsidering that even now the defendant has not and cannot deliver to plaintiffs their property in its entirety and integrity;\nConsidering that whilst the Goad plans belonging to plaintiffs were in the defendant's possession, and when said defendant was threatened to be sued, said defendant caused all the valuable information gathered since several years respecting insurance risks and which had been inscribed and annotated on said Goad's plans to be removed, erased and rubbed off;\nConsidering also that about 500 policy wordings were removed from the policy copy books by tearing off the leaves of said books, whilst they were in defendant's possession, which removal and destruction were not explained and justified in any way whatever;\nConsidering that the value of plaintiff's property so destroyed, to wit, the information on Goad's plans and the policy wording, is at least the sum of $2,200;\nConsidering that plaintiffs have established the essential allegations of their demand;\nDoth declare the said plaintiffs to be the only true and lawful owners and proprietors of said books, papers and documents claimed and demanded from the defendant, and the said plaintiffs entitled to the possession thereof; condemns the defendant to pay plaintiffs the said sum of $2,200, the whole with interest from this date and costs against said defendant.\nOn the appeal of the respondent the money condemnation was rejected with costs, upon the ground that the mutilation and erasures were not in issue.\nThe respondent invokes article 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure:\nEvery fact which, if not alleged, is of a nature to take the opposite party by surprise or to raise an issue not arising from the pleadings, must be expressly pleaded. See also art. 339 C. P. Q.\nThe trial judge has considered that the mutilations and erasures had been sufficiently alleged in the plaintiffs' conclusions, which pray\nthat in the event of the said defendant having secreted or made away with the said books, papers and documents or any part or any portion thereof, (he be condemned to pay) the value of the same, to wit, the sum of $10,000.\nThe slips on the eighteen policy copy books and the memoranda and notes on the Goad plans had been either secreted or made away with, and it was for that reason that the sum of $2,200 were allowed as representing in part the value of the property revendicated, and not as damages to plaintiffs for the privation of the papers and documents in the conduct of their business, a fact which could not be fully ascer- tained except in the distant future and induced them to reserve their remedy. We are not prepared to revise the ruling of the learned judge, except to the extent it may have caused injury. Lambe v. Armstrong ([1]); Eastern Townships Bank v. Swan ([2]); Finnie v. City of Montreal ([3]).\nThe defendant contends that he has been taken by surprise, at least as to the eighteen policy books, which had been delivered by him long before plaintiffs' answers to his pleas, without any allegation on their part that they were mutilated and incomplete, although fully aware of the fact. He swears that they were not made by him, nor by any one at his request or to his knowledge. \"We believe that he had reason to complain that, with regard to this item of $200, the evidence adduced was of a nature to take him by surprise and cause him injury and for that reason we are inclined to deduct that amount from the judgment of the Superior Court, although we admit that he could have prevented any possible injury, if, upon a proper affidavit, he had moved for an adjournment. The appellants have, however, assented to this deduction of $200, and it is not necessary to say any more about it.\nWith regard to the larger sum of $2,000, for necessary work to replace the Goad plans, which were discovered for the first time when they were delivered in November, 1901, under order of the court granted with the consent of the respondent, the judgment of the Superior Court is restored. The respondent cannot here allege surprise or any possible injustice, for he admits that the erasures were done by himself and a staff of clerks working day and night for two or three days preceding the seizure and to defeat the object of that seizure, he being dismissed at the time. The reason he advanced in his evidence for acting in this manner was that the pencil notes were made by himself and were his property. He sadly misunderstood his rights. All the courts are against him in this contention which is repeated in his factum, but was not pressed at the argument before us. Chief Justice Lacoste has dealt very lightly with this item, except that he finds the amount exaggerated. We are not willing to intertere in this respect with the judgment of the trial iudge, unless there was no evidence to support his finding: but it is admitted that there is precise evidence given by a competent witness, one Laidlaw, and we are not going to inquire why the learned judge, who saw the witnesses, adopted his appreciation of the cost of restoring the property to its original value.\nThe appeal is, therefore, allowed and the judgment of the Superior Court is restored for $2,000 with costs in all the courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants : Foster, Martin, Archibald & Mann.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Branchaud & Kavanagh.\n[1] 27 Can.

Co., claiming compensation for his death by negligence and alleging in her declaration that the negligence consisted in running a train at a greater speed than six miles an hour through a thickly populated district and in failing to giving the statutory warning on approaching the crossing where\n[page 2]\nthe accident happened. At the trial questions were submitted to the jury who found that the train was running at a speed of 25 miles an hour, that such speed was dangerous for the locality, and that the death of deceased was caused by neglect or omission of the company in failing to reduce speed as provided by \"The Railway Act.\" A verdict was entered for the plaintiff and on motion to the court, en banc, to have it set aside and judgment entered for defendants a new trial was ordered on the ground that questions as to the bell having been rung and the whistle sounded should have been submitted to the jury. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada to have the verdict at the trial restored and the defendants, by cross-appeal, asked for judgment.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that by the above findings the jury must be held to have considered the other grounds of negligence charged, as to which they were properly directed by the judge, and to have exonerated the defendants from liability thereon, and the new trial was improperly granted on the ground mentioned.\nHeld, also, that though there was no express finding that the place at which the accident happened was a thickly peopled portion of the district it was necessarily imported in the findings given above; that this fact had to be proved by the plaintiff and there was no evidence to support it; and that, as the evidence shewed it was not a thickly peopled portion, the plaintiff could not recover and the defendants should have judgment on their cross-appeal.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories ([1]) setting aside a verdict for the plaintiff and ordering a new trial.\nWetmore J., in his opinion on giving the judgment appealed from, states the facts as follows:\n\"On the 22nd June, 1903, the deceased Nicholas Andreas passed west on what is known as South Railway Street in the Town of Regina, came to Albert Street and then proceeded north on this last-mentioned street towards the defendants' railway. There was a railway crossing at Albert Street. In attempting to cross the railway at this crossing the horses and waggon in which he was driving were struck by one of the defendants' trains coming from the west, and he and the horses were killed and the waggon practically destroyed. The acts of negligence alleged and attempted to be proved were:\n\"1st. There was a failure to blow the whistle or ring the bell of the engine as provided by section 256 of 'The Railway Act,' 51 Vict. ch. 29, which was the Act in force at the time;\n\"2ndly. That the locus in quo was a thickly peopled portion of the town and the locomotive was passing there at a speed greater than six miles an hour;\n\"3rdly. That in view of the character of the crossing, it being one over which a great many people and teams passed, and the fact that there was a, tool shed, which would to some extent obscure from view an approaching train, the crossing was dangerous, and the train was running at a dangerous and reckless rate of speed. In coming along South Railway Street and passing along Albert Street, up to about opposite where this tool-house was, an approaching train coming from the west could be seen without any obstruction at a distance of at least one mile and a half away. This tool-house was ten feet three inches by twelve feet three inches, the height was twelve feet from the ground to the peak, and the sides were seven feet seven inches. Among other things it was contended on behalf of the defendants that the un contradicted evidence established conclusively that the death of Andreas was solely due to his own negligence; that if he had, as an ordinary prudent man would have done, looked in the direction of the west from which the train came he would have seen it; and that it must be assumed that he either omitted to take this ordinary precaution or if he did take it that he recklessly undertook to pass in front of the train and so his death was brought about by his own carelessness or recklessness; and that the trial judge should have non-suited the plaintiff at the conclusion of the case or directed a verdict for the defendants at the close of the whole case.\n\"Questions were submitted to the jury, which they answered as follows:\n\"1. Q. At what rate of speed was the engine running at the time it crossed Albert Street?\n\"A. Twenty-five miles per hour.\n\"2. Q. Was such a rate of speed a dangerous rate of speed for such a locality?\n\"A. Yes.\n\"3. Q. Was the death of the deceased caused in consequence of any neglect or omission of the company; is so, what was the neglect or omission which caused the accident?\n\"A. First, yes; second, failure to reduce speed of train as provided in 'Railway Act.'\n\"4. Q. If you find the plaintiff entitled to recover, at what do you assess the damages?\n\"A. (a) By reason of the killing of the deceased, $5.000. (b) For the destruction of the horses and the waggon, $400.\n\"The above questions were submitted on behalf of the plaintiff, and the following questions were submitted on behalf of the defendants and answered as stated below:\n\"1. Q. Could Andreas had he used ordinary care have seen the train in time to have avoided the accident?\n\"A. No, owing to the tool-house obstructing the view of the track for a considerable distance.\n\"2. Q. Could an ordinary man by the exercise of reasonable care have avoided the accident? \"A. Same as No. 1.\n\"3. Q. Did the plaintiff's husband exercise reasonable care to avoid the accident?\n\"A. Same as No. 1.\n\"4. Q. Might he have exercised greater care, and if so in what respect?\n\"A. No.\n\"5. Q. Did the condition of the approaches to the crossing on Albert Street in any way contribute to the accident, if so, how?\n\"A. No.\n\"6. Q. Could Andreas when he first observed train No. 2 have jumped and avoided death?\n\"A. No.\"\nOn these findings judgment was entered for the plaintiff for the amount of the damages assessed. The defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of the \"North-West Territories, en banc, to have the said judgment and findings set aside and judgment entered for them on the ground of failure by the plaintiff to prove negligence making them liable. On this appeal a new trial was ordered ([2]) on the specific ground that questions as to the bell being rung and the whistle sounded when the train approached the crossing should have been submitted to the jury.\nThe plaintiff then brought the present appeal seeking to have her judgment at the trial restored and the defendants, by cross-appeal, again asked for judgment.\nFord Jones, for the appellant, having stated the proceedings in the courts below, the court decided that the order for a new trial could not stand and called upon respondent's counsel to support his cross-appeal. Blaclcstock K.C. for the respondent referred to Wright v. Grand Trunk Railway Co. ([3]); Lloyd v. Woolland Bros. ([4]); Skelton v. London & Northwestern Railway Co. ([5]).\nFord Jones, for the appellant, cited Lake Erie & Detroit River Railway Co. v. Barclay ([6]); Smith v. Southeastern Railway Co. ([7]); Bonnville v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.([8]).\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This action was brought, in 1903, by the appellant as administratrix of the estate of her deceased husband, one Nicholas Andreas. She alleges that:\n1st. On the 22nd day of June, 1903, the said deceased was driving across the line of the respondents' railway with his team of horses and waggon, at a crossing on Albert Street, in the municipality of the Town of Regina, and that although all proper care and precaution was taken by him, a railway train, locomotive or railway engine in charge of the respondents' servants was illegally, wrongfully and negligently run or brought into collision with the horses and waggon of the said deceased, whereby the said deceased received such personal injuries that he and his said horses were immediately killed and his said waggon destroyed:\n21y. That the said train, locomotive or railway engine was being run through, and the said crossing was situate in, a thickly peopled portion of the said town at a greater rate of speed than six miles an hour, although the track of the said railway was not fenced according to the provisions of the statute in that behalf, namely, section 259 of the \"Railway Act of 1888,\" and that the said death of the said deceased and the killing of his said horses and the destruction of his said waggon were caused thereby.\n31y. That it was the duty of the respondent company to ring the bell with which the said engine on the said train was furnished or. to sound the whistle on the said engine at a distance of at least 80 rods westerly from the place at which the said railway crosses the said highway, and to keep the said bell ringing or to sound the said whistle at short intervals until the engine of the said train had crossed the said highway pursuant to the provisions of section 256 of the \"Railway Act\" of Canada; that the respondent company neglected to ring the said bell or to sound the said whistle and to keep the said bell ringing or to sound the said whistle at short intervals until the said engine had crossed the said highway; and the said injuries to and the said death of the said deceased and the killing of his said horses and the destruction of his said waggon, were caused thereby.\n41y. That the said train negligently and unlawfully approached and crossed the said highway at a very dangerous and reckless rate of speed; no warning or signal of the approaching train was given; no watchman with signals was placed at the said crossing, and no fence or gates were constructed thereat; and the death of the said deceased and the killing of his horses and the destruction of his waggon were caused by reason thereof.\nThe respondents pleaded, 1st, denying the allegations of the appellant and not guilty by statute; 2ndly, that the death of Andreas was due to his own negligence, and that he could have avoided the accident by the exercise of reasonable care.\nThe case was tried at Regina before Mr. Justice New lands. At the close of the appellant's case the respondents moved for a non suit, but the motion was refused. Questions were then submitted to the jury, and answered as follows:\nQuestions submitted at the request of the appellant. At what rate of speed was the engine running at the time it crossed Albert Street? A. 25 miles per hour.\nWas such rate of speed a dangerous rate of speed for such locality? A. Yes.\nWas the death of the deceased caused in consequence of any neglect or omission of the company? If so, what was the neglect or omission which caused the accident? (1) Yes. (2) Failure to reduce speed of train as provided in \"Railway Act.\"\nIf you find the plaintiff entitled to recover, at what do you assess the damages? A. (a) By reason of the killing of the deceased $5,000; (b) For the destruction of the horses and waggon $400.\nQuestions submitted on behalf of the defendants.\nCould Andreas, had he used ordinary care, have seen the train in time to have avoided the accident ? A. No, owing to the tool-house obstructing the view of the track for a considerable distance.\nCould an ordinary man, by the exercise of reasonable care, have avoided the accident? A. Same as No. 1. Did the plaintiff's husband exercise reasonable care to avoid the accident? A. Same as No. 1.\nMight he have exercised greater care, and if so, in what respect? A. No.\nDid the condition of the approaches to the crossing on Albert Street in any way contribute to the accident? If so, how? A. No.\nCould Andreas, when he first observed train No. 2, have jumped and avoided death? A. No.\nThe respondents then moved for the dismissal of the action, but that motion was refused and a verdict for appellant entered for $5,400. The respondents then appealed to the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories, where it was held ([9]) that though the verdict could not be sustained and the respondents' appeal had to be allowed, yet their motion for the dismissal of the action could not prevail, but that a new trial had to be ordered upon the ground that the jury were not asked special questions as to the ringing of the bell and sounding of the whistle. Against this order both parties now appeal, the plaintiff asking a restoration of the judgment she obtained at the trial, the defendants asking that the action be dismissed and the order by the court en banc for a new trial set aside.\nUnder the circumstances, the respondents' motion for a judgment dismissing the action and their appeal from the judgment refusing that motion is the first to be considered.\nThe jury's finding that Andreas was killed by the negligence of the respondents in failing, on the occasion in question, to reduce the speed of their train as provided by the \"Railway Act\" is exclusively based on section 259 of the \"Railway Act of 1888,\" which enacts that:\nNo locomotive or railway engine shall pass in or through any thickly peopled portion of any city, town or village at a speed greater than six miles an hour unless the track is fenced in the manner provided by this Act.\nThat was the first charge of negligence against the respondents in the statement of claim. Now, it is evident that this finding necessarily imports a finding that this accident occurred in a thickly peopled portion of Regina, a fact which the appellant had to prove, but of which there is no evidence to justify the verdict. In fact the contrary clearly appears. The evidence on the point is that east of Albert Street stretches the railway reserve extending from South Railway Street across the railway track to Dewdney Street about 500 yards north of the track. On this there are no houses. Then west of Albert Street the railway reserve extends from South Railway Street across the railway to a line 150 feet north of the track. There are no houses thereon nor within 200 feet of the railway (including streets) and that for a mile and a half west as previously stated there were no houses within the same limits. North of the railway reserve and street adjoining it and west of Albert Street between the reserve and Dewdney Street were a few scattered houses, west of which was open prairie.\nQ. Are there many buildings? A. There is hardly any buildings,\nsays Watson, and Powel says:\nThere was not a great deal of settlement on the north side of the track. There are six or seven houses on Albert Street; one or two on Dewdney Street north and quite a number south. There was a fairly good settlement on Dewdney Street. The Government offices were there, mill, electric light. Considerable traffic across it. (Cross-examined). No residence within 200 feet of railway track. Train not running through residence portion of city. Not running through dwelling house or on a street.\nAnd that evidence is not contradicted. Indeed it could not be. So much so that Mr. Justice Wetmore felt justified in remarking with the concurrence of all the other three judges that, if allowed the privilege of exercising his own knowledge of the locality, he would have had no hesitation in stating that in his opinion \"the place of the accident was not a thickly peopled portion of the town.\" The verdict of the jury on this fact cannot, therefore, be sustained.\nIf this was not proved to be then a thickly peopled portion of Regina, this charge of negligence, it is conceded, fails and it is the only one found. The case was rightly left to the jury, however, because in answer to question No. 3,\nwas the death of the deceased caused in consequence of any neglect or omission of the company, if so, what was the neglect or omission which caused the accident?\nthey might have felt justified in finding that the respondents had been guilty of the other negligence charged by the statement of claim, that is, in not sounding the whistle or ringing the bell as required by the statute. The judge had properly told them that:\nThe first question is whether, from the evidence which has been given to-day, the provision of ringing the bell and blowing the whistle has been complied with. It is for you to find from the facts submitted to you whether these provisions I have mentioned have been complied' with or not. You have heard all the evidence and I am going to leave it to you whether from that evidence these provisions were complied with and whether from the quarter-mile post they rang the bell and blew the whistle at intervals until they came over that crossing.\nNow the jury, with such clear and direct instructions on the point, having answered that the cause of the accident was the failure to reduce speed under, section 259 of the Act, must be considered as having negatived all the other charges of negligence. It is true that their finding as to the failure to reduce speed rendered it immaterial whether the bell had been rung or the whistle sounded. But the appellant shaped her own questions to the jury and, by not pressing this charge before them or insisting upon an answer, must be held under the circumstances to have abandoned it. She cannot have been under the impression that each of her charges could form the subject of a separate trial. If the jury had answered to that third question: \"Yes, failure to blow the whistle and ring the bell as required by the statute,\" and the court had set aside that verdict, no second trial could have been given her, whatever the evidence might have been, simply to enable her to try again her complaint of failure by the respondents to reduce the speed of the train on the same occasion.\nThe result is that the main appeal should be dismissed, the cross-appeal allowed and the action dismissed, with costs in all the courts against the appellant on both appeals.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed, both with costs, for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Davies as to contributory negligence on the part of the deceased.\nI express no opinion on the other branch of the case.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This case came before us as an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories and by way of cross-appeal.\nMr. Blackstock, for the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., which cross-appealed, admitted that he could not, in consequence of the late decision of this court in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Hainer ([10]), maintain the judgment appealed from on the ground stated. He contended, however, under his cross-appeal, either that the verdict of the jury should be set aside and judgment entered for the defendant or that there should be a new trial on the grounds, (1st.) that there was no evidence of negligence on defendants' part; (2ndly.) that, if there was, the deceased had been guilty of contributory negligence; and (3rdly.) that the damages awarded to the widow and her child, of $5,000, were grossly excessive, and that no evidence whatever of any pecuniary damage had been given.\nI have read through the evidence given at the trial most carefully and have reached the conclusion that it is impossible to sustain the verdict and that the defendants are entitled to have judgment entered for them.\nThe accident which resulted in the death of Andreas took place where the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway crosses Albert Street in Regina, N.W.T. The locality is in the outskirts or suburbs of the town, and one of the most important questions, in fact under the findings of the jury the most important question, to be determined is whether or not the locality where the railroad crossed Albert Street was a thickly populated part of Regina.\nThe only finding of negligence on the part of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. was the rate of speed at which the train crossed the street. The track was admittedly not fenced as prescribed by the Act, and if the place was a thickly peopled portion of the town the speed at which the train crossed the street, about twenty-five (25) miles an hour, was in direct violation of the provision of section 259 of the \"Railway Act\" as amended by 55 & 56 Vict. ch. 27, sec. 8. If it was not a thickly peopled portion the rate of speed was not negligence. The question of negligence or no negligence therefore depended entirely upon the fact of the locality where the accident occurred being a thickly peopled part of the city or town.\nThis question of fact is one which might well under certain circumstances and conditions give rise to fair and reasonable doubts, and if the evidence in this case could do this I would hesitate long before interfering with the finding of the jury.\nIt was strongly contended by Mr. Blackstock that there was no express finding of the jury on the point at all and that as it was a crucial fact, and one on the existence of which the sole negligence of the railway company could be imputed, the plaintiff's case necessarily failed.\nBut while I think it is to be regretted that a question was not distinctly put to them whether this locality at Albert Street through which the railway passed was a thickly peopled portion of the Town of Regina, still I think a reasonable construction of the answers given by the jury to the questions as put cannot have any other interpretation than that they did so find. The sole question remaining is whether or not there was any evidence to justify the finding. Certainly none was given on behalf of the plaintiff. On the contrary the evidence of the witnesses called on her behalf conclusively establish, to my mind, that the locality at the crossing was not \"a thickly peopled portion of the town\" within the Act. I need not quote the evidence because there is no contradiction with respect to the facts stated by the witnesses. The result may be broadly stated to be, that the point where the railway track crosses Albert Street is about 200 feet north of South Railway Street and 1,050 feet, or about 350 yards, south of Dewdney Street, each of which streets Albert Street runs into and at right angles with. The railway track runs substantially east and west and Albert Street north and south; that there was no person living between South Railway Street and the railway track, nor for one hundred yards on the south side of South Railway Street, and no one living along the track anywhere within one hundred yards; that from South Railway Street to the track on the west side the land was simple prairie or open common, and on the east side was reserved and held vacant by the railway. The railway reserve was 150 feet wide west of Albert Street on both the north and south sides of the railway and east of Albert Street 200 feet wide, south of the track, and over 500 yards wide north of the track extending up to Dewdney Street. That there was some settlement north and west of Albert Street up to Dewdney Street, and that these houses, 6 or 7, with one or two exceptions, face on Albert Street, and behind them to the west is prairie or open common. The east side of Albert Street to the north of track as far as Dewdney Street, like the east side between the track and South Railway Street, was not built on at all. The Government offices and public buildings and the grist mill and electric light building were between one-quarter and one-half a mile to the westward and there was a fairly good settlement along Dewdney Street some 400 yards away. As Powell, the plaintiff's witness, put it:\nThere are six or seven houses on Albert Street, one or two on Dewdney Street north and quite a number south. There was a fairly good settlement on Dewdney Street. The Government offices were there, mill, electric light.\nAnd again,\nThe Albert Street sidewalk joined the Dewdney Street sidewalk. There was a trail from the crossing across the prairie to the Government offices, barracks, etc. Had it not been, therefore, for the evidence given by the company's engineer (Sims) to the effect that he had at the time of the trial swung a circle with a quarter mile radius centering on Albert Street crossing and found 155 dwelling houses within it, the question would not on the evidence have been open to the slightest doubt. This evidence, however, is quite consistent with the undoubted fact that there was \"considerable settlement\" along Dewdney Street and South Railway Street, but chiefly near the outside of the radius he swung and not near the centre of the circle. Unless all the plaintiff's evidence is to be disbelieved on this point that is the only explanation, of the existence of 150 dwelling houses within the one-half mile circle.\nThe onus of proving the fact of the crossing being in \"a thickly peopled portion of the city or town\" lay upon plaintiff. She entirely failed to discharge it. The finding of the jury on the point, assuming that there has been a finding, is without any evidence to support it, and, therefore, the only evidence of any negligence on defendants' part is wanting.\nEven if, however, there could be any doubt upon this point, I am also of opinion that defendants are entitled to judgment on the issue of contributory negligence. The finding of the jury on this point is as follows:\nCould Andreas, had he used ordinary care, have seen the train in time to have avoided the accident? A. No, owing to the tool house obstructing the view for a considerable distance.\nNow, what are the facts? There is no finding that he did not see, or could not if he had used ordinary care have seen, the train coming in towards the crossing he was moving towards from the time he turned at South Railway Street into Albert Street and all the time he was moving slowly with his team along Albert Street towards the crossing until his view was obstructed, by the tool-house.\nNow, the tool-house was a small house 10 ft. by 12 ft. and about 8 ft. high, standing up and alongside of the west side of Albert Street within, say, 18 ft. of the railway track. For the moment of time that he was passing this little' tool-house his view would be obstructed, but to ask any reasonable being to hold that such momentary obstruction released him from the plain, simple and obvious duty which lay upon him of exercising reasonable care in looking at and for the train from the time he left South Railway Street until the moment when his vision was obscured by the little tool-house, is asking too much. He may not have looked during the passage of his team from South Railway Street till he actually passed the tool-house, and his horses were almost, if not quite, upon the track certainly within a few feet of it. Certainly the evidence would justify a finding that he did not look. But under the circumstances he was bound to look. His view was uninterrupted. Had he looked he could and must have seen the train coming towards the crossing he intended to pass over, at least a mile away. The evening was clear, bright and without wind. Everybody else who was called as a witness was looking and saw the train and the danger and feared an accident unless the deceased stopped. He alone appears to have been stolid, careless and indifferent. If ever a man jogged along carelessly to his death he appears to have done so.\nAn argument was attempted to be raised that his attention was distracted by an engine of the defendant company on a switch on the other side of the crossing and by a whistle from this engine and the shouting of some workmen alongside of it calling upon him to stop. But the jury have not found this. On the contrary, they carefully limit the excuse for his negligence in not looking for nor seeing the fatal train approaching to the little tool-house obscuring his view. In effect they negative, or at any rate decline to accept, the suggestion that the deceased's attention had been distracted by the engine noises and calls of the workmen on the other side of the track and I think they were right in so doing.\nI am, therefore, of opinion, alike on the ground of the failure on plaintiff's part to give any evidence from which reasonable men looking fairly at the whole circumstances could justify a finding of negligence on defendants' part, and also on the ground of contributory negligence on deceased's part, even if defendants' negligence had been proved, that the defendants' cross-appeal must be allowed and judgment entered for the defendants on the whole case.\nI do not wish, by my silence on the point, to be understood as even remotely sanctioning the view that a verdict for $5,000 for the death of a man of the class and condition of the deceased in this case could be sustained in any event under Lord Campbell's Act without at least some evidence of the pecuniary damage his widow and child sustained.\nThe only property of any kind he ever was shewn to have owned was the team he was driving at the time of his death and this ownership is asked to be assumed from his possession only. What his occupation was, whether he did or did not own a farm, and if so, what was its value, or whether he was a mere servant or labourer, and if the latter, what wages he earned, and all other information from which reasonable inferences might be drawn of the pecuniary dam- ages incurred by his wife and family from his death, seem studiously to have been kept in the back ground. The cross-appeal should be allowed with costs in all the courts and the main appeal dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014In this case the plaintiff, as administratrix, recovered, by the verdict of the jury, $5.400, and judgment for her was entered thereupon by the learned trial judge.\nUpon appeal there from to the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories, en banc, that court, not having before it the judgment of this court in The Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Hainer ([11]), seemed so pressed with the exposition of the law in The Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McKay ([12]) (as read by the members of the court), set aside the verdict and granted a new trial, in order that the other grounds taken at the trial by plaintiff, but not passed upon by the jury, might be tried out.\nThereupon the plaintiff, becoming aware of our decision in The Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Hainer ([13]), took an appeal to this court.\nUpon the opening of the argument it was properly conceded that if the findings of the jury were entitled upon the evidence to stand, The Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Hainer ([14]) must entitle the plaintiff to succeed in this appeal.\nThe respondents had, however, by way of cross-appeal, raised the question that upon the whole of the evidence the plaintiff should have been nonsuited.\nThe case has, therefore, been argued upon this contention. The plaintiff sued for damages caused by the collision of the defendants' train with the team of the plaintiff's late husband, at a crossing in the Town of Regina, which resulted in the death of her said husband and the destruction of his team.\nThe defendants' railway, at the place in question, was unfenced in any way. The train was moving confessedly at the rate of twenty-five miles an hour.\nThe first question presented thus for consideration was whether or not this rate of speed was a violation of section 259 of the \"Railway Act,\" ch. 29, of the statutes of Canada of 1888, which, as amended by 55 & 56 Vict. ch. 27, sec. 8, provides as follows:\nNo locomotive or railway engine shall pass in or through any thickly peopled portion of any city, town or village, at a speed greater than six miles an hour unless the track is fenced in the manner prescribed by this Act.\nThe portion of the Town of Regina through which the train in question passed at the place of the accident is alleged by the defendants not to have been then thickly peopled.\nThe evidence on this point is not as clear as it might 'have been made. It should not have been a difficult matter to have shewn how many houses actually existed at the time within a given radius of the spot where the accident occurred, and what these houses were, whether dwelling houses or other houses of that public character that would lead people to visit them.\nI think, however, that there was sufficient evidence furnished (the most pointed being given by defendants' witnesses) at the trial, under the circumstances, to entitle the plaintiff to have the case on this point passed upon by the jury.\nThe learned trial judge had during the trial called attention to the fact that all the jurors lived in Regina and knew the locality. No one objected to the learned judge taking that view, and when he reiterated in his charge, without objection, the same thing, I think we must take it that the respondents by their silence assented to that way of treating the case.\nIf so they ought not now, in this court of appeal, to be heard, to take any advantage of it.\nThere was nothing extraordinary in it. Every day in trying cases those engaged therein assume that to be common knowledge which, perhaps, is not strictly within the technical meaning of such kinds of evidence as renders notice thereof as part of common knowledge permissible.\nIf it is assumed as being assented to no one can complain. No one should complain.\nMany of the allusions in the evidence bearing upon this point, that seem vague and almost unmeaning to me, were no doubt well understood by the court and jury possessed of a local knowledge.\nI need not say that counsel can insist on shutting out such appeals to the personal knowledge of the jury, unless by means of a view directed by the court in the ways provided therefore by law.\nThey can, if they choose, in a civil trial at least, permit, instead of a view, the jurors to act on the knowledge of locality that they may possess.\nThe finding of the jury, read as it must be in light of the learned judge's charge, is clearly intended as a finding that the place in question was so thickly peopled as to require the train of defendants to move at a rate not exceeding six miles an hour. The court below seemed unanimously to think the evidence such as to render it a question for the jury. The respondents say, however, that even if they otherwise should be so found liable, the deceased by his own want of care brought about his own death. What is there to support this contention? Is it a case for ignoring the jury and withdrawing the case from them? Is the evidence of want of care all one way? Was the want of care inexcusable? What measure of care is called for on the part of travellers coming to a crossing?\nIt is not the measure of care that I or any judge or lawyer, whose sense of danger is quickened by long experience in dealing with such cases, may possess that is to be exacted. It is the care that must be expected on the part of an ordinary prudent man.\nThis case does not disclose whether or not deceased knew from daily or long experience that trains coming from the west approached the station there at such a high and, to a stranger, probably unexpected rate of speed.\nFor aught we know he may have crossed there only once before.\nThis crossing was just beside the station grounds. And if, as is highly probable, he assumed all trains stopped at the station a short distance east of the crossing he would likely know that such a high rate of speed as this train moved at might not be expected.\nHe did know that on his right hand and immediately beside him there was in the yard an engine moving backwards and forwards, which needed, or might be reasonably assumed to need, on his part, constant watchfulness.\nWe are asked to say, as matter of law, that whilst guarding his horses and exercising that constant watchfulness thus imperatively called for, he must be held wanting in the care of an ordinary man of prudence, and guilty of negligence, because he did not discover (within about twenty seconds, as I will show) by also looking the other way, until too late, the incoming train on his left hand. Is that a proposition that in law can be maintained?\nThe only case nearly like it is the recent case of Wright v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co. (1), where undoubtedly the engine or train that engaged the injured man's attention was standing. In this case the engine diverting attention was, if two of the witnesses are to be believed, moving from time to time nearly, if not quite, up to the moment deceased came to the crossing.\nIt matters not here that other witnesses say to the contrary. It was for the jury to decide which were telling the truth.\nIt would seem also as if the motion of the reins in deceased's hands indicated that he had looked to the west and discovered his danger, but too late. And the few-moments that the tool-house hid the coming train from the view of the deceased might, but for that obstruction, have enabled him to see it sooner and turn his horses aside and save himself.\nTo say that he could have looked before coming there is true. I am unable, however, after a most careful perusal of this evidence and of much of it several times, to feel quite sure just what he could have seen by looking. Those who tried the case were much more likely to understand the allusions in the evidence and know just how far such looking would have served deceased. How far from, in approaching, a crossing must a man look both ways?\nThe deceased had driven westward along South Railway Street which runs alongside on the south side of the track. Then at the junction of South Railway Street with Albert Street which crosses the track the deceased turned northward along Albert Street. How far that point of turning is from the railway track in question I am quite unable to discover, with certainty, from the evidence before us. Why this was not made clear I am unable to understand. It is not only the turning point on the road, but the turning point of the case. Up to this turning point it is not probable that the deceased could have seen the incoming train from the west with which he collided. The track is, to a person on the eastern part (over which deceased drove) of that street, obstructed from view by the buildings of one Sinton, who was one of the witnesses. At the south-east corner of the said junction of streets are these buildings. And so far as I can make out, from the plans exhibited in argument, they are immediately facing that part of South Railway Street, to the east of them, over which deceased had come. There was a jog in that street, at the junction with Albert Street, that makes for our present consideration as if the South Railway Street had ended there. While we have heard a great deal about the possibilities of seeing the incoming train in question at the distance of a mile, we have not been shewn or pressed with any argument that would show that any one could expect the deceased to have seen through Sinton's buildings or past them, so as to have seen the train before he turned, at the jog I refer to. How far had he then to go until he reached the cross-ing? How far past Sinton's buildings northerly could he go without seeing a train if it were a mile away? How far could he see along the railway track to the west, at any and each step of what he had to travel over, going northerly? I am unable on this evidence to do more than guess the answer to any of these questions. Yet it is upon an accurate answer to such questions, or some of them upon which we can rely, that this case hinges.\nThe witness Sinton stated that his house was about one hundred and sixty-six feet from the railway track. In cross-examination he was pressed, by counsel for defendants, to say whether it was not two hundred and thirty-seven feet and a half, and he was unable to say that he would contradict any one if he swore to that. The railway officials failed to clear this up. Defendants put in a plan that has a mark on Albert Street two hundred and thirty-seven and a half feet, but it does not show properly from where or to where it is estimated to designate. And all the witness is asked by way of verifying it is as follows:\nNow I notice on this plan certain measurements. Are those measurements correct? A. Yes.\nThis plan seems more for other purposes than any relating to this question of the distance from Sinton's house to the track. How am I to verify it? Am I to guess how wide South Railway Street is or was, and how wide Albert Street was or is, and apply this vague and uncertain kind of evidence and determine for myself the exact distance deceased had to go after reaching a point where he could see a train? Am I in short in a better position to know than the jurors who knew the locality and everything that was said by the witnesses in relation to the different localities, and understood everything that was said?\nOn the evidence it is purely guess work, to make any accurate estimate of the distance that the deceased had to travel after making the turn and getting out past Sinton's house so far on to Albert Street that he could have had a view of the coming train or west-ward track. We do know from the evidence that the tool-house was nineteen feet from the track. We also know that the tool-house took up twelve or fourteen feet further space, but how it stood in relation to the track, whether with the length or the width facing Albert Street or the railway, which does not cross Albert Street at right angles, we are not told. These trifling-differences might make but a few feet in the distance to be travelled to get past the house. But when evidence is put before the court that the house is only six or seven feet high and no explanation given as to which way the roof runs which was, at the peak thereof, twelve feet high, I think we are not helped as much as we might have been to an understanding of the exact situation. Then, assuming that the south side or end of this tool-house would be fifty-two to fifty-five feet south of the track and that one hundred and sixty-six feet from Sinton's is to be taken as the correct measurement, there would be one hundred and one or one hundred and four feet from Sinton's to the tool-house. From this should we deduct sixty-six feet for width of South Railway Street? If so, we then have only thirty-five or thirty-eight feet that the deceased passed without looking where he might have seen. Double the distance for argument's sake, and then we are left to say as matter of law that a man whose attention was diverted to an actual danger on his right hand, having missed the opportunity of looking whilst passing a particular seventy or eighty feet of road, is to be held guilty of such inexcusable negligence as to deprive him and his representative, by reason thereof, of any remedy, is something which I venture to say has never yet been ruled in an English or Canadian case. Let us consider the plans and compare them and then try another way. Plan Exhibit 1, that the company produced, shows what I take to be a measurement of two hundred feet from the track to the south line of the eastern part of South Railway Street, which line seems, when projected, to come out on the face of the north side of Sinton's buildings, which the evidence shows do mark on the ground the south boundary of the South Railway Street at that part. To understand this the jog must be borne in mind. Deduct from two hundred feet the width of the street, and we have a distance of one hundred and thirty-seven feet to travel, after the turn was fully made and deceased passed the junction. Let that be reduced by the distance taken up by the tool-house and nineteen feet beyond and it leaves only eighty-two or eighty-five feet over which deceased in his travelling could have looked westward and seen anything coming from the west on the track. Of course, I refer to such a distance, away west on the track, as the train must, according to the evidence, have been at this time when the deceased, it is said, ought to have looked.\nAnother way to find the distance from the track to Sinton's house is to assume the track, as the plan indicates it, in the centre of a road allowance of 300 feet, and add 66 feet for width of road to half of this and we have 216 feet altogether. Deduct one-half the width of the track, the distances to the tool-house and past that house, and part of road allowance, to get where team had got past Sinton's house; and this being fairly done, we have not in one way as much as above, or to take as an extreme view the other way of looking at it, more than one hundred feet for deceased to travel. Assume any of these results of estimated distances to be correct. Then at the rate of three or four miles an hour the deceased had to cover such distance only about twenty seconds in which to look, whilst passing the open space, where he is charged with neglecting to look: Suppose he postponed doing so till nearer the track and as a stranger not regarding the house, but the track\u2014was it unreasonable neglect? Was it such neglect under the circumstances of having to watch to the right? Was it so especially when in law the defendants' train ought not to have travelled there at more than six miles an hour? What right have they to insist under such pressure from them, to the right and to the left of the driver, on such promptness of action\u2014and decision on the part of the driver? Surely they had no right to create, by their unlawful act, a condition of things demanding such urgency on the part of deceased, and then turn round in light of the results and claim the benefit of their own wrong? The case of Correll v. The Burlington, etc., Railroad Co. ([15]), at p. 125, has some remarks which might be adopted here on this point. It is to be observed that once past the tool-house the team could not have been turned round. The approach to the crossing of the track sloped up, and was too narrow to permit of turning.\nAnother thing lost sight of in the evidence of some witnesses is the curve in the track within the mile back that has to be reckoned with, on this point of the case, and weighing the evidence given. What use to tell us about the possibility of seeing a train a mile distant, as witnesses do, who had from their point of view nothing to allow for obstruction or for this curve? Why was the evidence not confined to the point or points of view that deceased had and that alone? Why have we not a single witness that speaks pointedly as having tested any of those points of view, at any one of the places deceased is by the argument of defendants required to have looked? To my mind it is very singular indeed, if not suspicious, that if the company really had such a clear case from any of these points of view, that we are not favoured with any such tests. It is true that the engineer of the coming train, presumably as was his duty looking ahead, says he saw the deceased or his team. His evidence is open to comment, it is not quite consistent and leaves room for mistakes on his part. The degree of credence to be attached to it was peculiarly for the jury.\nIt is made clear that standing on the track, at the point where deceased was killed, and looking west-ward, one can see a long distance. It does not seem to have served deceased to look just then for the train was too near.\nIt devolved upon the defendants to make all this clear. Have they done so? It was no part of the plaintiff's duty to clear this up. She is entitled to insist that the burthen of proof which rests upon the defendants, setting up contributory negligence, should be met with that degree of certainty that will enable the court to say before submitting it to the jury that there is evidence of contributory negligence. And then, before withdrawing it from the jury as clearly proven, and entitling a judge to dismiss the action, the proof must be so clear and satisfactory that twelve reasonable men cannot be supposed honestly and reasonably to find it possible to come to the conclusion that it is not sufficient. And there must be no evidence to the contrary. If there be evidence to the contrary the case must go to the jury. Is that the case here? To grant a non suit on such evidence, as in this case, seems to go further towards the abolition of the right to a juror's judgment than any case has yet gone.\nIn many cases where there was no excuse for failing to look the courts have, in absence of that or any other evidence rebutting or explaining such failure, non suited. But here exists strong reason excusing, if ever a man had an excuse, for watching to the right more than the left. And to pass upon it the jury were the proper tribunal. I think the deceased had far more excuse than the unfortunate people in the Hainer Case ([16]). In that case the people were walking and had only to guard a few steps.\nI think, also, that probably the jury here were quite as competent as I to determine what degree of foresight should be exacted from a man driving a team under the circumstances I refer to.\nSo far as the law has yet gone, I am unable to hold that a man must in law have looked both ways within the limits of a distance of only seventy-five to one hundred feet before reaching such obstruction to view as existed here at a railway crossing, or be there after his own assurer.\nThe \"stop, look and listen\" rule in Pennsylvania exacts in substance nothing more.\nAnother feature, pressed in argument as if against deceased, I take entirely the other way.\nMen undoubtedly called to him and raised a great cry. But I think their efforts, however kindly meant, in all probability diverted him from looking to the west and made him look more intently the other way. Am I to forget also the many cases in which it has been said that momentary forgetfulness as a possible factor in the conduct of every man is a thing to be considered in weighing what a prudent, careful man of the ordinary reasonable type may be held in law bound to do?\nI cannot, having regard to all these considerations, which we must observe and which, indeed, so to speak, form part of this case and must in law be reckoned with, on the evidence before us, see how this case could properly have been withdrawn from the jury.\nIt was their province to weigh and decide upon such matters as I have adverted to, and they have decided adversely to the defendants, after a proper charge from the learned trial judge.\nI think their finding must stand.\nIt was possible for the finding to have been the other way, and had it been so the result must have stood.\nI think the appeal of the plaintiff ought to be allowed and the cross-appeal of the defendants dismissed and both with costs to the plaintiff.\nThe court below, upon contradictory evidence as to the point of ringing of the bell and blowing of the whistle, not passed upon by the jury, thought proper to direct a new trial. I understand that some of the majority of this court decide that the verdict covers the point because the jury gave only one reason and omitted any other.\nWith respect I must add, that without the majority of this court agreeing that such contributory negligence has been shown as defeats the action, we ought not to interfere with the discretion of the court below in granting a new trial to clear up the issue upon which no verdict has been given. Maclennan J.\u2014After a very careful consideration of this case I am constrained to the conclusion that there was no sufficient evidence to warrant the finding of the jury that the part of the town at which the unfortunate accident occurred was a thickly populated part thereof, and, therefore, that the speed of the train was not illegal.\nOn this point I concur in the reasons of my brother Davies, which I have had an opportunity of reading.\nI also agree with him in the opinion that there was no sufficient evidence of pecuniary damage suffered by the plaintiff and her child, by the death of her husband, to warrant the verdict of $5,000 to be divided equally between them.\nOn the question of contributory negligence I think the jury might quite properly find, as they did, upon the whole of the evidence, although they specify only one particular ground for their finding.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs and that the cross-appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court below.\nAppeal dismissed with costs and cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Jones & Gordon.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Mackenzie & Brown.\n[1] 2 West.

Tupper was set aside.\nThese proceedings were instituted in the Court of Probate for the Count of Colchester, N.S., at Truro, under the provisions of section 34 of the \"Probate Act\" (N.S.) which provides that any executor may be required by any person interested in the estate to have the will proved in solemn form. The testator, Abraham N. Tupper, who died on the 23rd day of February, 1902, left a will bearing date February 20th, 1902, also one bearing date September 4th, 1901. In the will of 20th February, 1902, the testator named his wife, Harriet N. Tupper, executrix, and the respondents, Frederick Tupper and Edwin Dickie, executors, and these proceedings for proof in solemn form of that will were instituted by the testator's widow.\nThe learned judge of probate pronounced against the will of 20th February, 1902, upon the ground that, in view of such will having been prepared by Frederick Tupper, who was one of the residuary legatees named therein, and of the doubtful capacity of the testator when instructions were given for the will, and entire incapacity at the time when it was executed, those seeking to establish the will had not done so by evidence of the clear and unquestionable character required in such cases, and he decided, therefore, that the will should not be admitted to probate. On appeal to the court en banc this judgment was set aside and the will of February, 1902, declared to be valid and the last will of the testator. The appellant society were residuary devisees under the former will of 1901, and parties to the proceedings in the probate court.\nW. B. A. Ritchie E.C. for the appellants.\nNewcombe K.C. and Mellish K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (oral.)\u2014The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the probate court restored. The appellants' costs on the appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and on the appeal to this court should be allowed against Frederick Tupper personally.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting).\u2014It seems to me, on the evidence, that in February, 1902, the deceased intended to and did make a new will purporting to dispose of his entire estate. The majority of this court proposes to reject this new will as invalid, as there is a suspicion that attaches to it, and which, in their opinion, has not been cleared up. The court en banco has unanimously found against the appellants, reversing the ruling of the probate judge who had held that the last will and testament of the deceased was a former one made in September, 1901.\nAt no time in the courts below did any one of the parties imagine that the court would make a third will out of the two made by the testator, as suggested by my brother Davies. The parties contesting the last will, and claiming under the first one, did not set up any such contention in any contestation or argument.\nThe probate judge did not suggest any such adjustment. He rejected the last will in toto. Taking his view of the evidence I doubt that he could have rendered a different decree. The full court of Nova Scotia understood the fact in a different light and restored the last will of February, 1902.\nTaking the view of the facts proved in the case as expressed in the strong opinion of Mr. Justice Graham, in which I concur, I am of the opinion that the whole of the last will should prevail, and I would dismiss the appeal with costs. DAVIES J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (Fraser J. hesitante) reversing the decision of the county court judge for the County of Colchester (N.S.), acting as probate judge, refusing to admit to probate a will purporting to be that of the late Abraham N. Tupper, bearing date the 20th February, 1902, three days before his death.\nThe learned trial judge pronounced against the will of February 20th, 1902, upon the ground that, in view of such will having been prepared by Frederick Tupper, who was one of the residuary legatees named therein, and of the, at least, doubtful capacity of the testator when instructions were given for the will, and entire incapacity at the time when it was executed, those seeking to establish the will had not done so by evidence of the clear and unquestionable character required in such cases, and the learned judge concludes his judgment by saying:\nNot being, therefore, judicially satisfied that this will is the true last will and testament of the deceased, I think that it should not be admitted to probate and so direct.\nThe judgment of the trial judge and also that of Graham J., who delivered the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, are very voluminous and exhaustive. The latter judgment reviews all the facts and the conclusion is that any suspicions which may have been aroused as to the will of February 20th, 1902, not expressing the true mind and desire of the testator because of its having been prepared by his brother Frederick Tupper, who was a large beneficiary under the will, were sufficiently satisfied and allayed by the circumstances of the case and by the evidence of the draftsman beneficiary Frederick Tupper. The will of 20th February, 1902, was contested by his widow, Harriet N. Tupper, his adopted daughter, Matilda Tanner, and also by the appellant the British and Foreign Bible Society and the Congregational Church of Truro, but the only contestant appealing to this court is the Bible Society.\nThe Bible Society and the Congregational Church were residuary legatees under a previous will made about five months before his death, viz., on the 4th September, 1901, and which was produced in evidence and proved.\nThe latter will of 20th February, 1902, did not profess expressly to revoke the former one of 4th September, 1901, and as I shall hereafter shew only did so impliedly in so far as the provisions of the latter will altered or were inconsistent with the former one.\nThe testator at the time of his death was seventy-six years of age. He left no issue but had an adopted daughter, Matilda Tanner, now a widow, who, with her daughter Gladys, aged about ten, lived with the testator and his wife as part of the family.\nThe testator was one of the leading supporters of and contributors towards the Congregational Church at Truro, and was secretary of the British and Foreign Bible Society at Truro, in which he had always been greatly interested and to which he had frequently expressed his intention of leaving a portion of his property. At the time of the execution of the will of the 4th September, 1901, the testator was in good health and of strong testamentary capacity. The will which he then executed was one drawn by himself and in his own handwriting. The evidence was clear and strong that his interest in and warm sympathy with the Bible Society and the Congregational Church had continued unabated until his death, and that on the other hand the relations between himself and brother had been for some time past very cool, if not strained. They seldom exchanged visits or saw each other.\nThere were substantial differences between the two wills which need not be set out at length. Under the former will neither Frederick Tupper nor his sister, Mrs. Fulton, got anything. They were not even mentioned in it. Under the latter they each got one of his farm properties. The farm devised to Frederick was valued at about two thousand dollars ($2,000), and the lot devised to Mrs. Fulton at about five hundred dollars ($500), and these two Frederick Tupper and Mrs. Fulton, in addition to the specific devises to them, were substituted as residuary devisees in the places of the Bible Society and the Congregational Church. There was also a substantial difference in the provisions made for his adopted daughter and grand-daughter, those in the first will being very much more favourable to them.\nThe entire value of his estate was agreed to be about $10,000.\nInasmuch as Mrs. Tupper, the widow, only had a life interest in the property left for her support the value of this residuary devise would be dependent upon the time of her death, and if that happened soon after her husband's death would be very large having reference to the value of the whole estate.\nHaving reached the conclusion concurred in by both courts below, that the evidence as to undue influence and want of testamentary capacity was not strong or conclusive enough to justify the setting aside of the last will, I do not deem it necessary to go at any greater length than I have done above into a discussion of the differences between the two wills. The questions at issue here are, I think, reduced to the one whether or not the evidence in support of this will in favour of which the court is asked to pronounce, and under the terms of which the writer of the will became entitled to such substantial benefits, is sufficient to satisfy the court judicially that the paper does express the true mind and will of the deceased.\nSo far as the devise of the farm to Frederick Tupper is concerned, and so far as all the other parts of the will are concerned down to, but not including, the residuary devise, I am not satisfied that the doubts and suspicions naturally aroused by the evidence and all the circumstances are sufficient to justify us in pronouncing against the will. I have already said there is no sufficient evidence of the exercise of undue influence by either Frederick Tupper or his sister, Mrs. Fulton. I am more than doubtful whether the testator was at the moment of time of the execution of the instrument of sound mind and memory and capable of understanding the contents of what he was signing. I think there was sufficient evidence, however, to justify the courts in concluding that at the time he gave his instructions to the draftsman or writer, Frederick Tupper, he knew what he was doing and authorized the changes made from the former will outside of the disposition of the residue. As there is reasonable ground for holding the will as drawn (always excepting the residuary devise) did conform to the instructions the dying man gave it can, under the authority of Perera v. Perera[1], be upheld as valid.\nBut then we are face to face with the question whether the testator had actually changed his mind with regard to the residuary devise and had determined to omit the Bible Society and the Congregational Church from his will altogether, and substitute as beneficiaries for them his brother, who drew the will, and his sister, and whether he actually instructed his brother to make such an important change.\nThen what is the law where a will is written or prepared by a party in his own favour. In Williams on Executors (10 ed), 1905, at page 86, it is said:\nBy the Civil law, if a person wrote a will made in his own favour the instrument was rendered void. That rule has not been adopted by the law of England, which only holds that where the person who prepares the instrument or conducts its execution is himself benefited by its dispositions this fact, unless it be merely the case of a small legacy to him as executor, or other such circumstances, creates a suspicion of improper conduct and renders necessary very clear proof of volition and capacity as well as of a knowledge by the testator of the contents of the instrument.\nThis doctrine was fully considered by the Lords of the Judicial Committee in the case of Barry v. Butlin[2]. In delivering the judgment of their Lordships in that case, Parke B. made the following observations:\nThe rules of law, according to which cases of this nature are to be decided, do not admit of any dispute so far as they are necessary to the determination of the present appeal, and they have been acquiesced in by both sides. These rules are two; the first is, that the onus probandi lies upon the party propounding a will, who must satisfy the conscience of the court that the instrument propounded is the last will of a free and capable testator. The second is that if a party writes or prepares a will, under which he takes a benefit, that is a circumstance which ought generally to excite the suspicion of the court, and calls upon it to be vigilant and jealous in examining the evidence in support of the instrument, in favour of which it ought not to pronounce unless the suspicion is removed, and it is judicially satisfied that the paper propounded does express the true will of the deceased. These principles, to the extent that I have stated, are well established; the former is undisputed; the latter is laid down by Sir John Nicholl, in substance, in Paske v. Ollat[3], Ingram v. Wyatt[4], and Billinghurst v. Vickers[5], and is stated by that very learned and experienced judge to have been handed down to him by his predecessors; and this tribunal has sanctioned and acted upon, it in a recent case, that of Baker v. Batt[6].\nThese rules of law were expressly adopted by Lord Cairns and approved by the other law Lords in the case of Fulton v. Andrew, at page 461.\nIn the case of Brown v. Fisher[7] Sir James Hannen, the president, in delivering judgment, after citing with approval the doctrine laid down in Williams on Executors, above quoted, and the rules of law formulated by Parke B. cited above and approved of by Lord Cairns, goes on to say:\nI have usually taken the opportunity of referring to that as laying down what is the guiding principle to be acted on in cases of this kind. Now in the present instance the will was indeed prepared by a solicitor who was, however, carefully excluded by the plaintiff from all communication with the testator. The plaintiff of course says that he did so by the authority of the testator, but he has no evidence in corroboration of that statement and it depends entirely upon his own evidence, whereas there is a strong presumption against its correctness from all the circumstances of the case.\nThe learned president in that case held that where a beneficiary who had procured and subsequently propounded a will failed under those circumstances to satisfy the court by \"affirmative and conclusive evidence\" that the testator did in fact know and approve of the contents of the will, which he had actually executed, the court applying and acting upon the principles laid down by the House of Lords in Fulton v. Andrew[8], would refuse probate of the will with costs.\nNow, applying these principles to the case before us let us look at the facts. I appreciate fully the grave importance of reaching the conclusion that there is no sufficient evidence to warrant us in finding that the testator had so changed his mind with regard to the residue and that he had so instructed his brother.\nThe evidence seems to me to shew beyond reasonable doubt that the great purpose he had in mind in making a new will was so to change the old one of the previous September as to meet the objections raised by his wife, and several times talked over with her by him, as to the impolicy of postponing the time when the residuary devise was to take effect so far as the Congregational Church was concerned. It is reasonably clear, however, that in doing so he decided to make still further changes, and amongst them to give his brother and sister each a farm and a lot of land, and also to alter the provisions he had made for his adopted daughter, and to a limited extent those made for his wife. These changes were more or less talked over and explained by Frederick Tupper with Mrs. Tupper, the testator's wife, the day the will was drawn, and though perhaps not fully explained or not fully understood by the wife and the adopted daughter, still I have reached the conclusion that the evidence taken as a whole is sufficient to establish that these changes were determined upon by the testator and were made.\nOutside of the evidence, however, of Frederick Tupper himself there is not a scintilla of evidence to establish the faintest intention on the testator's part to change the beneficiaries of the residuary devise of his September will. The trial judge distinctly declines to accept the uncorroborated evidence of Frederick Tupper on this crucial point, and I am bound to say I concur in his conclusions. Much necessarily depended upon the credibility of the witnesses. The trial judge distinctly states with respect to Mrs. Tupper's testimony that\nshe convinced me of being a most conscientious and intelligent witness and I attach full weight and credit to her testimony.\nShe emphatically denies that Frederick Tupper either read to her, as he says he did, the whole will or that he ever intimated in any way that the residuary clause had been changed. She admits, however, that other portions of the will were read to her. I would gather from her evidence that substantially all of the will except the residuary devise was so read.\nIt is true that Frederick Tupper states that he received the instructions to make himself and his sister the residuary devisees and that he did read the will to the testator as it now appears. But the trial judge distinctly refuses to believe that statement, and I am bound to say that a careful perusal of the whole evidence satisfies me that his finding in this respect was in accordance with the weight of testimony.\nThe evidence of Mrs. Tanner, the adopted daughter, and Mrs. Tupper, is very strong that it could not have been read to the testator, at any rate not in the way and manner required by the law.\nAs to what is a sufficient reading of a will such as this making important changes in the will executed a few months before and substituting the draftsman of the second will and his sister as the residuary devisees instead of the former beneficiaries, the observations of Lord Cairns and Lord Hatherley in the case of Fulton v. Andrew[9] are most apposite and instructive. At pages 462, in commenting upon the law laid down by Lord Penzance to the jury in the case of Atter v. Atkinson[10], Lord Cairns says: In the first place the jury must be satisfied that the will was read over, and in the second place must also be satisfied that there was no fraud in the case. Now, applying those observations to the present case, I will ask your Lordships to observe that we have no means of knowing what was the view which the jury, in the present case, took with regard to the reading over of the will. The only witnesses upon the subject were those witnesses who were themselves propounding the will. No person else was present\u2014no person else knew anything upon the subject. It appears that these witnesses stated either that the will was read over to the testator, or that it had been left with him over night for the purpose of being read over. The jury may, or may not, have believed that statement, or may have thought, even if there had been some reading of the will, that that reading had not taken place in such a way as to convey to the mind of the testator a due appreciation of the contents and effect of the residuary clause\u2014and it may well be that the jurors, finding a clear expression of the intention of the testator, or what they may have thought to be a clear expression of the intention of the testator, in the instructions for the will, were not satisfied that there was any such proper reading or explanation of the will as would apprise the testator of the change, if there was a change, between the instructions and the will.\nAnd again at page 465:\nIt was suggested that, when once the jurors had before them uncontroverted evidence that the will was read over to the testator, any verdict on their part that the residuary clause was not known to the testator would be opposed to their finding upon the issue that he was of sound and disposing mind. I say that that again was a question for the jurymen, and it might well be that they would not believe the evidence with regard to the reading over of the will. Upon these grounds, endeavouring to place myself in the position in which the court of probate was placed when it had to deal with this rule nisi, I feel myself obliged to say that there was nothing which could be alleged against this verdict of the jury which required the court to direct a new trial. It was eminently a question for the jury, and I see no reason whatever to be dissatisfied with the verdict.\nAnd Lord Hatherley at page 468 says:\nA matter which appears to me deserving of some remark, and upon which the Lord Chancellor has already fully commented, is the supposed existence of a rigid rule by which, when you are once satisfied that a testator of a competent mind has had his will read over to him, and has thereupon executed it, all further inquiry is shut out. No doubt those circumstances afford very grave and strong presumption that the will has been duly and properly executed by the testator; still circumstances may exist which may require that something further shall be done in the matter than the mere establishment of the fact of the testator having been a person of sound mind and memory, and also having had read over to him that which had been prepared for him, and which he executed as his will. It is impossible, as it appears to me, in the cases where the ingredient of fraud enters, to lay down any clear and unyielding rule like this.\nAnd again at page 473:\nThe case is a singular one in its character, and without wishing to shake the force of the observations made by the learned judge of the probate court, as to the danger (which is a real danger) of holding that any man of sound mind who has put his hand to an instrument after having had that instrument read over to him, can have meant otherwise than what he said; admitting all that, yet I do say that at least the jury should be satisfied that it was read over to him, and not only that it was read over to him, but that it was read over in such a manner as that the discrepancy between the instructions and the will was brought before the consideration of the testator. It appears to me that in this case there is nothing to induce us to say that the jurors were not warranted in their conclusion.\nAdopting these legal conclusions of these eminent jurists it seems to be impossible on the evidence in this case to reverse the findings of the trial judge or to hold that this will was ever read over to the testator so as to convey to his mind a due appreciation of the contents and effect of the residuary devise, and that he was taking away from the Bible Society and the Congregational Church all that he had devised to them by the will of September and substituting the draftsman and. his sister for the society and the church.\nMrs. Fulton, one of the residuary devisees herself, who was present with testator a great part of the day the will was drawn, admits that she never gathered from the testator any idea of an intention to make Frederick and herself or either of them residuary legatees. She says that no mention ever was made of the residue nor that he intended to give Frederick or herself any portion of it, and further that when the testator told her it was his intention to give Frederick the farm and her the Lay ton lot that he (the testator) also said that Frederick would like the Layton lot too, but that the farm was enough for him. This was within a few hours or so of the execution of the will.\nThis by itself would, of course, be far from conclusive, but Mrs. Tanner, the adopted daughter, who was present in and out of the room most of the time when the testator was giving the instructions about the will, states what took place on the point I am discussing as follows:\nQ. Did he say anything to the deceased while you were there? A. The first question I heard him ask papa was, \"Newcombe, when Harriet is done with this, what do you want done with it?\" He asked him that question once, and papa's answer was, \"I want it collected and put in the bank for Harriet's use.\" Fred then said, \"Newcombe, when Harriet is done with this\u2014when she is dead\u2014 what do you want done with this?\" and he said again, \"I want it collected and put in the bank for Harriet's use,\" and Fred rose and said, \"That is not what I asked you. I want you to pay attention to what I say. Don't think about anything else. When Harriet's done with this money, what do you want done with it?\" and papa said, \"I want it collected and put in the bank for Harriet's use,\" and before he had done speaking Fred left the room impatiently. When he left the room he went into the dining room. When he left the room I went to the bedside and applied a cooling lotion to the patient's forehead. He said, \"Where has Fred gone?\" I pointed to the dining room door and he said, \"He has gone to judgment.\" Shortly after that I went out into the kitchen for some nourishment. Fred Tupper returned to the sick room as soon as I left. I came back in two minutes and he left the room as soon as I came in. I remained for some time and then went out for some stimulant, and he came in when I went out again. I don't know whether any writing was going on. He had left some notes on the dining room table, and the second time I came out I looked over the notes.\nQ. Were these notes completed then? (witness shewn notes). A. It seems to me that the paper I saw was written on both sides. I could not be positive, but I think the papers I then saw were written on both sides. There were two half sheets lying on the table, and I am quite sure I read both sides.\nQ. Was this in the notes that you read\u2014that the balance left of his estate after the death of his wife was to go to Fred Tupper and Mrs. Fulton; was that in the notes you read? A. No.\nQ. When was it you first saw the provision about giving the residue of the estate to Fred Tupper and Mrs. Fulton? A. It was later in the evening. I saw it in the completed will.\nFrom the time Fred Tupper finished the will to the time the witnesses came, the will was not read over to Mr. Tupper to my knowledge. I had an opportunity of knowing. I was attending and taking charge of the patient. I was not out of hearing long enough for the will to have been read over to him.\nShe was severely cross-examined on the point, but persisted in her evidence, saying:\nI did not hear the will read. I don't think it was read. There was no chance for it to be read without my hearing it.\nAn attempt was made to discredit her evidence on this point because she said at one place in her cross-examination that she did not hear any conversation they had about the residue. There was no discussion with the testator in my presence as to \"what should be done with it when Mrs. Tupper was done with it.\" But in a few moments afterwards she explains that she understood the question of counsel to refer \"to discussions between Fred Tupper and Mr. Tupper\" in her hearing, and that in the answer above quoted she was \"referring to discussions between Fred Tupper and Mrs. Tupper.\"\nMrs. Tupper is equally, if not more, emphatic about the reading of the will. She swears first that Fred Tupper professed to read the will over to her, tout never read the part referring to the gift of the residue to himself and his sister. Again and again she repeats this over, and declares that she never knew anything about it until she learned of it after the will was signed from Mrs. Tanner. She is equally emphatic in stating that the will could not have been read over by Fred Tupper to her husband after the former had done writing it, and declares that before it was signed she said to Fred Tupper that the will should be read over to her husband and that he replied either \"it has\" or \"I did,\" and did not read it then as she desired him to do.\nA careful study and analysis of the whole evidence has convinced me that there is sufficient to uphold the second will of the 20th February, 1902, except the residuary clause; that the only evidence in support of this clause is that of Fred Tupper, the draftsman of the will and joint beneficiary with his sister under this clause; that there is no corroborative evidence of any kind whatever either as to the testator entertaining or expressing any intention of changing the residuary legatees under the previous will or of his having instructed Fred Tupper to make the change; that the only proper conclusion which should be drawn from the evidence as a whole is that while the other parts of the will may have been read over to the testator the residuary devise certainly was not read or was not at any rate so read that the testator might have understood or did understand it; that at the time of the giving of the instructions for the drawing of the will the testator may be held to have been of sound disposing mind and memory and capable of making a valid testamentary disposition of his estate; that he was not in such a condition at the time of the actual execution of the will and, therefore, there will not, from the mere proof of execution in the light of his then capacity, arise any presumption of knowledge of the contents of the will. But on this question of presumption the law as laid down in Fulton v. Andrew[11], by Lord Cairns is that even where there is affirmative evidence of knowledge by reason of the will having been read over to a testator competent in mind before execution there is no unyielding rule of law shutting out all further inquiry.\nThen, if so, what is the law with respect to the residuary devise appearing in the will and yet found not to be the will of the testator? Must the entire will be set aside and probate refused, or may the part proved be accepted and the part not proved rejected? And in the latter case is there an intestacy as to the residue, or in cases where there is no express revocation of previous wills may the parts of the previous will not inconsistent with the later one be accepted and probate granted with respect to them?\nThere have been doubts in former times upon the point, but the later cases seem to have removed those doubts and placed the law upon the basis of right and common sense. In Allen v. McPherson[12] all the distinguished jurists who there delivered judgments, but especially Lord Lyndhurst, at page 209, and Lord Campbell, at page 233, expressed themselves in terms which leave no doubt that the ecclesiastical courts formerly could and the Court of Probate can now admit part of an instrument to probate and refuse it as to the rest.\nThe present law is well summarized on pages 87-88 of Powles and Oakley on Probate (ed. of 1892). It reads as follows:\nWhat is now the law on this point has been very clearly and simply laid down by Lord Penzance in the case of Lemage v. Good-ban[13]. His Lordship says:\u2014\"The case of Plenty v. West[14], so far as it supports the doctrine that the use of the words 'last will' in a testamentary paper necessarily imports a revocation of all previous instruments, is, I think, overruled by Cutto v. Gilbert[15], and Stoddard v. Grant[16]. * * * Cases of the present character are properly questions of construction, and in deciding on the effect of a subsequent will on former dispositions, this court has to exercise the functions of a court of construction.\" The principle applicable is well expressed in Mr. Justice Williams book on Executors (9 ed.), pp. 139-140. He says:\u2014\"The mere fact of making a subsequent testamentary paper does not work a total revocation of a prior one, unless the latter expressly or in effect revoke the former or the two be incapable of standing together; for though it be a maxim, as Swinborne says above, 'that no man can die with two testaments,' yet any number of instruments, whatever be their relative date, or in whatever form there may be, (so as they be all clearly testamentary) may be admitted to probate as together containing the last will of the deceased. And if a subsequent testamentary paper be partly inconsistent with one of an earlier date, then such latter instrument will revoke the former, as to those parts only where they are inconsistent.\" This passage truly represents the result of the authorities. The will of a man is the aggregate of his testamentary intentions, so far as. they are manifested in writing duly executed according to the statute. And as a will, if contained in one document, may be of several sheets, so it may consist of several independent papers, each so executed. Redundancy or repetition in such independent papers will no more necessarily vitiate any of them, than similar defects if appearing on the face of a single document.\nIn the notes of this paragraph cited from the tenth edition of Sir E. V. Williams' book on Executors, page 120, many of the later cases are cited. In In the Goods of Petchell[17] Sir James Hannen acted upon the rule laid down in the text of Williams, and admitted the two instruments together to probate as together containing the will of the deceased. The case is one very much in point, for the part of the first will in that case admitted to probate was the residuary devise, which, as in this case, was held not to have been revoked. See the remarks of the President, Sir James Hannen, pp. 156-157. See also In the Goods of Sir J. E. Boehm[18], where it was held that probate of a will omitting or striking out the name of Georgiana in the second clause of gift might be granted to executors. Morrell v. Morrell[19]. The cases are not all uniform and the true rule to be adopted seems to be that followed by Sir James Hannen in Dempsey v. Lawson[20], where after reviewing the cases that learned judge concludes that the use of phrases such as \"my last will\" does not necessarily import a revocation of a previous will, and that not even the presence or absence of a general revocating clause is conclusive. That in the alternate result it must come down to a question of intention to be gathered from a comparison of both wills. He adopted as a proper rule that laid down by Lord Penzance in Lemage v. Goodban[21]:\nThe intention of the testator in the matter is the sole guide and control. But the intention to be sought and discovered relates to the disposition of the testator's property and not to the form of his will. What dispositions did he intend, not which or what number of papers did he desire or expect to be admitted to probate, is the true question.\nThis no doubt must be the true rule. As Sir J. Nicoll says in Methuen v. Methicen[22]:\nIn the Court of Probate the whole question is one of intention; the animus testandi and the animus revocandi are completely open to investigation in this court.\nThe late case of Townsend v. Moore[23] is most instructive on the point I am discussing. Part of the head note to the report of that case reads:\nBut when the provisions of two testamentary documents, the priority of which is uncertain and in neither of which there are expressed words of revocation, are apparently inconsistent, the court will endeavour so to construe the words that if possible the two documents may stand together and may both be admitted to probate as expressing together the whole testamentary intention of the testator.\nThe Appeal Court in this case reviewed most of the authorities to which I have referred and approves and adopts the paragraph from Williams on Executors which I have above quoted. It also reviews and approves of the decisions in the case of Lemage v. Goodban[24], and In the Goods of Petchell[25], and Vaughan Williams L.J. quotes extensively from the judgment of Sir James Wilde in the former case and also from that of Sir James Hannen in the latter. In the quotation from the latter judgment is the following:\nThe law thus laid down was acted upon by my predecessor, Lord Penzance, in Lemage v. Goodban(1). In that case there were two instruments, both purporting to be the last will and testament of the deceased. In each will there was a residuary clause, but in the latter it was perfectly unintelligible and it was impossible to give effect to it. The court held it was justified in granting probate of both instruments, because the earlier contained a residuary clause which it was thought it was not the intention of the testator to revoke. That precedent I am entitled to act upon in this case. * * * Acting on the decision to which I have referred, I have come to the conclusion that I am justified in holding that the testatrix intended that the residuary bequest, which is found in the first will, but not in the later, should form part of her will, and that by varying in the second instrument the dispositions of the former she did not intend to revoke the residuary clause contained in the earlier paper.\nThe conclusion reached by the L.J. is stated at page 83 as follows:\nUpon the authorities I come to the conclusion that, if on any reasonable construction the two documents can stand together, it is the duty of the court of probate to admit both documents to probate.\nRomer L. J., at page 84, states the law to be:\nBut when there are two testamentary documents, and the court is able to gather that one was not intended wholly to revoke the other, but that both were intended to be effective, at any rate to some extent, then I think, on authority and on principle, that the two documents must be admitted to probate, so that effect may be given to them, so far at any rate as circumstances will permit. How far that could be done would be left to a great extent to a court of construction to determine. The authorities to which my brother Vaughan Williams has referred shew, I think, that this is the correct view of the law, and I need not further dwell upon them.\nIn the present case I am of opinion that the intention of the testator to be gathered from the dispositions of the two wills. omitting the residuary devise from the latter which I reject for the reasons before stated, is that the two wills should stand together and rather than that an intention to create an intestacy with regard to the residue should be presumed the residuary devise in the first will, which is not in any way inconsistent with the proved portions of the second will, and is not, therefore, revoked by it, should together be taken and held to constitute the true will of the deceased and the two instruments ought to be admitted to probate as in In the Goods of Petchell[26] as together containing the will of the deceased.\nOn the question of the addition of another executor by the second will, see In the Goods of Matthew Leese[27], where Sir C. Greswell held, page 443:\nThe executors of the second will are entitled to ask for probate of the first as well as the second will.\nI think the cases of Lemage v. Goodban[28], in 1865, and In the Goods of Petchell(1), (1874), and Town-send v. Moore[29], conclusive as to the right of the court to admit to probate both instruments as containing the will of the deceased.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversed, and the record remitted to the court of probate for the County of Colchester with directions to admit the two instruments of the dates of 4th September, 1901, and the 20th February, 1902, to probate as containing together the true will of the testator, viz., the unrevoked residuary clause of the first will and the second will omitting its unproved and rejected residuary clause.\nWith respect to costs I think the costs of all the parties so far as the probate court is concerned should be paid out of the estate, but that the costs of this appeal and that to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia should be allowed to appellant as against Fred Tupper one of the respondents. The other respondent joining as one of the executors for the sake of conformity not having costs against him.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014In the case of Barry v. Butlin[30] Baron Parke delivering the judgment of the court said:\nThe rules of law, according to which cases of this nature are to be decided, do not admit of any dispute so far as they are necessary to the determination of the present appeal, and they have been acquiesced in on both sides. These rules are two; the first that the onus probandi lies in every case upon the party propounding a will, and he must satisfy the conscience of the court that the instrument so propounded is the last will of a free and capable testator.\nThe second is that if a party writes or prepares a will, under which he takes a benefit, that is a circumstance that ought generally to excite the suspicion of the court, and calls upon it to be vigilant and jealous in examining the evidence in support of the instrument, in favour of which it ought not to pronounce unless the suspicion is removed, and it is judicially satisfied that the paper propounded does express the true will of the. deceased.\nThese rules have been observed ever since in a line of cases of the highest authority and express what undoubtedly is the law that ought to govern our decision here.\nHave the respondents satisfied all the requirements of these rules by the evidence put before the Court of Probate in which the alleged will now in question was propounded?\nThe learned trial judge seems to have correctly apprehended the law that must govern him. He had to deal with much conflicting evidence given by witnesses in his presence and has not only failed to find, after an exhaustive analysis of the evidence, that the alleged will can be held proven, but has also referred to Mrs. Tupper as being\na most candid, frank, conscientious and intelligent witness (and that he) attached full weight and credit to her testimony.\nI have read all of the evidence in the case and much of. it more than once, and its perusal impresses me that what the learned trial judge thus says of Mrs. Tupper is absolutely correct.\nIf she is thus to be relied upon and her evidence accepted in its entirety it is impossible to uphold the alleged will.\nI need not for the purposes of disposing of this case go further. I had written at length an analysis of the whole evidence, and it became apparent to my mind that in the statement of facts in his very able judgment the learned trial judge had in no particular overstated the case against the will.\nIn some particulars, needless to enlarge upon here, the facts seemed to me more strongly against the position of the respondent, Fred. Tupper, than the learned judge saw fit to present them.\nI do not see any good purpose to be served by giving here at length the analysis I made, but content myself with adopting the judgment of the learned trial judge which I think should be restored. The appeal must be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nI think the respondent, Fred. Tupper, should pay the general costs of both appeals. He is entitled to costs out of the estate as given by the trial judge.\nBut when he ventured beyond that, he was doing more than his duty as a trustee required, and ought, I think, to abide by the usual result of such a venture.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014After a very careful study of the evidence in this case I have come to the same conclusion as the learned trial judge. It would serve no useful purpose to state the impressions made upon my mind by the evidence of the various witnesses, as was so elaborately done by both the trial judge and by Mr. Justice Graham who delivered the opinion of the Supreme Court. Suffice it to say, that I think the respondent, Frederick Tupper, who prepared the will, has not discharged the onus which rested upon him, as a comparatively large beneficiary under the will, as required by the cases of Fulton v. Andrew[31]; Tyrrell v. Painton[32], and Adams v. McBeath[33]. Nor am I satisfied that the deceased was, during the preparation and at the time of the execution of the will, of sufficient testamentary capacity to enable us to uphold it as valid.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.

The renewal receipt was not countersigned nor delivered to the assured and the agent did not remit the amount of the premium to the company. When the note fell due it was not paid in full and a renewal note was given for the balance which remained unpaid at the time of the death of the assured. The conditions of the policy declared that if any note given for a premium was not paid when due the policy should cease to be in force.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (38 N.S. Rep. 15) Davies and Maclennan JJ. dissenting, that the transactions that took place between the assured and the agent did not constitute a payment of the premium and that the policy had lapsed on default to meet the note when it became due. The Manufacturers Accident Ins. Co. v. Pudsey (27 Can. S.C.R. 374) distinguished; London and Lancashire Life Assurance Co. v. Fleming ([1897] A.C. 499) referred to.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] which set aside the judgment entered upon the findings of the jury and dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe action was brought by the beneficiary under a policy of life assurance and the only question raised upon the pleadings and to be tried was whether or not the renewal premium was paid in cash to the company's agent when it became due. The renewal premium was payable on the 15th of October, 1902, and on the expiration of the days of grace the assured gave the local agent of the company a note, for the amount of the premium with interest added, at sixty days, which the agent caused to be discounted and the proceeds were placed to the credit of his personal account in the bank. When the note fell due a partial payment was made on account and the assured gave the agent another note for the balance remaining due which he failed to pay, and he died on the 12th of March, 1903, without having paid the amount of the renewal note. The agent was in possession of a properly signed renewal receipt for the premium at the time these transactions took place, but he did not countersign it, as required by its conditions, nor did he remit the proceeds of the note discounted to the company. Later on, while, the renewal note was current, he returned the renewal receipt to the company as unpaid, and the policy was noted as lapsed. At the trial the jury found that the premium had been paid in cash to the company at the time when the local agent discounted the first note and received the proceeds and, upon this finding, judgment was entered in favour of the plaintiff. The judgment now appealed from set aside the verdict as being against the evidence and dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs. Mellish K.C. for the appellant. We submit that the findings of the jury and the judgment thereon should be restored, or in the alternative a new trial ordered. Under the facts the jury could have come to no other conclusion than that the premium was paid in cash to the company's agent. It was received to be discounted, and the discount charge was added to the face of the note; the agent used the note for the purpose for which it was given, not to pay the premium with the note, but to get the money in payment of the premium by discounting the note. The agent got the money in that way and held it for his company, but subsequently changed his mind, as he found he had made a mistake in lending his own credit to the assured who was in financial difficulties. The note was not payable till sixty days after its date (15th Oct., 1902). The agent was not authorized to take a note in payment of the premium, and the policy would have been avoided thirty days after that date (the grace allowed), and the assured could not have revived it even by paying the note at maturity. See opinions by Sir Henry Strong in London and Lancashire Life Assurance Co. v. Fleming[2], in the Privy Council and by Burton and Osier and Maclennan JJ. in the same case in the Court of Appeal for Ontario[3], at pages 670-673; also by Meredith C.J. in the report of the judgment of the trial court[4]; which clearly indicate that if such an agreement as that referred to had been proven, and the notes discounted, as they were by this agent, it would have amounted to a payment of the premium in cash. The condition and the stipulation in the application for insurance, made part of the contract, that if any note given for a premium be not paid when due the policy will not be in force, refers only to such notes made directly to the company. See also The Manufacturers' Accident Ins. Co. v. Pudsey[5].\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondents. There was no evidence whatever of payment of the premium, and the learned trial judge should have withdrawn the case from the jury, as requested by counsel at the trial on the conclusion of the plaintiff's case. It was for the judge, alone, to decide whether or not any facts had been established by evidence, from which payment of the premium might be reasonably inferred, and if such facts had not been established by evidence then it was his duty to have withdrawn the case from the jury. Metropolitan Railway Co. v. Jackson[6], per Cairns L.J. at page 197; Ryder v. Wombwell[7], per Willis J. at page 38; Bridges v. North London Railway Co.[8], per Pollock B. at page 221. We also rely on Dublin, Wicklow & Wexford Ry. Co. v. Slattery[9], and particularly the observations of Lord Penzance at page 1175, Lord O'Hagan at pages 1181, 1182, and of Lord Coleridge, pages 1195-1197.\nThe fact that the renewal receipt had not been countersigned, as required by its conditions, is a fact strongly demonstrating that the premium had not been considered as having been paid. Moreover, it never reached the possession of assured. Confederation Life Association v. O'Donnell[10]; Busteed v. West England Fire and Life Ins. Co.[11]; Bunyon on Life Assurance (3 ed.) p. 83; London and Lancashire Life Assurance Co. v. Fleming[12]; Torrop v. Imperial Fire Ins. Co.[13].\nThe proceeds of the note were held by the agent merely as agent for assured. If he had agreed to apply these funds to the payment of the premium he never so applied them. The money was paid into his bank account as the agent of Hutchings to pay the premium and he never did pay the premium. He never paid out the money as instructed by his principal, but kept it in his personal account and used it for his own purposes. If assured gave the note to him as agent of the company his act, in taking the note, was not binding on the company, because it was beyond his authority as defined by the policy to take such a note.\nIt is submitted that the agent held the money as agent for Hutchings until the maturity of the note, when, if Hutchings paid it, he got the renewal receipt and the agent was to pay the company. This is shewn by the renewal receipt being attached to the note. Later on when it became evident that Hutchings could not pay the renewal note and re-pay the sum advanced by the agent on renewing it, it was agreed that the agent should treat the paper as for his own accommodation, to which Hutchings agreed.\nThe respondent relies on the following authorities: Acey v. Fernie[14], approved by the Privy Council in London and Lancashire Life Assurance Co. v. Fleming (1); Bartlett v. Pentland[15]; Baines v. Ewing[16]; Brice on Ultra Vires (3 ed.) p. 658; Giblin v. McMullen[17]; Riddle v. National Fire and Marino Ins. Co. of New Zealand[18]; Hine Bros. v. Steamship Insurance Syndicate[19]; Phillips v. Mayer[20].\nThe fact of there being an express condition in the policy, limiting the authority of the agent, was notice to the assured that the agent was not possessed of power to take a renewal note. It was not, therefore, within his apparent authority, as it appeared otherwise from the policy. Frank v. Sun Life Assur. Co.[21]; McGeachie v. North American Life Ins. Co.[22].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and GIROUARD J. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014My mind fluctuated a good deal during the course of the argument before us, but a careful reading of the evidence and judgments appealed from, and further consideration of the arguments of counsel have convinced me that there was sufficient evidence before the jury to enable them to find a payment in cash of the premium by the assured to the agent of the company. The agent held in his hands at the time the renewal receipt duly signed by the company's proper officers.\nThere is no term of the policy requiring this receipt to be countersigned or delivered by the agent. It merely requires, to enable the agent to receive payment, that he should have in his possession the receipt signed by the president, managing director and secretary of the company, or any two of them. On this evidence there was a finding in favour of the plaintiff and on that finding the trial judge directed judgment to be entered for her. The question is one purely of fact. Both parties rely upon the case of London and Lancashire Life Assur. Co. v. Fleming[23]. Applying the principles of law determined in that case to the facts proved in this the question is reduced entirely to one of fact: Did or did not Harrington receive the premium in cash? And the proper tribunal to determine it, once there was evidence to submit to them, was the jury.\nOn the 15th day of October, 1902, the agent of the company, Mr. Arthur E. Harrington, went to the insured and arranged with him to raise the money by a note which Harrington was to discount. The premium was $49.27, and the note was for $50.27\u2014the difference being to pay the charge of discounting. Harrington discounted the note with the bank and got the proceeds, $49.27, to remit to the company, but failed to remit, as he heard very shortly after taking the note that the assured was in financial difficulties. The note was payable sixty days after date.\nIt was argued that because Harrington had the proceeds of the note put to his credit in his account in the bank where he discounted the note that, in some way or another, he could not be said to have received it in cash.\nI am unable to appreciate or accept that argument or to discern the substantial difference between Hutchings taking the note, having it discounted and handing over the proceeds to Harrington or the latter discounting it and putting the cash to his own credit. In either case he would have received the cash.\nIt matters not what Harrington did with the cash after he received it or how long afterwards he heard assured was in financial difficulties and determined upon protecting himself by retaining the money he had received as the proceeds of the note.\nAll the subsequent acts and conversations of the agent and the assured may have been good evidence to thrown light upon what was the real transaction at the time of the discount of the note.\nBut it was all admitted, and went to the jury and the finding of the jury, which in my opinion was justified, should not be disturbed.\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This case is clearly distinguishable from that of the Manufacturers' Accident Ins. Co. v. Pudsey[24], upon which appellant relies. There the renewal receipt which was a badge of authority in the hands of the agent was found by the jury to have been delivered over to the assured upon his payment of part of the premium and giving his note for the balance, and the court held correctly that there was evidence to go to the jury on that and other points in dispute.\nThe failure of the assured here to get the receipt for the premium or perhaps even to have seen it and the peculiar circumstances connected with the retention of it by the agent tell against the assured having relied upon the agent having authority, or the company by any act of theirs inducing him to rely on the authority of the agent for doing as he did.\nThe principles upon which the decision in the case of London & Lancashire Life Assurance Co. v. Fleming[25] rests are decisively against the case of the appellant here.\nI think, therefore, that the appeal ought to be dismissed with costs. MACLENNAN J. (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and that the judgment at the trial should be restored.\nThe life policy sued on provides that the premiums, after the first, shall be paid at the head office of the company. But by a privilege or proviso indorsed upon the policy and made part thereof it is declared that premiums may be paid to any officer or agent who has in his possession a printed receipt therefor issued by the company and signed by the president, managing director and secretary or any two of them. Such a receipt duly signed in accordance with that privilege or proviso was in the hands of the agent of the company, Mr. A. E. Harrington, at the time of the transactions between him and the deceased which are in question.\nI think, in the first place, it is clear that if the assured had paid the premium to Harrington that was all he was required to do. It was not necessary that Harrington should deliver the receipt to him or that he should request or demand that to be done. The payment of the money was the essential and only thing required to be done and the sole question is whether or not the assured did in fact pay his premium to Harrington.\nWhat took place was this: The premium, $49.27, was due on the fifteenth of October, 1902, and the assured had not the money, so the company's agent, Mr. Harrington, took a note at sixty days for the sum of $50.27, the excess over the amount of the premium being for the discount charged by the bank. Mr. Harrington says that he discounted the note and the proceeds, $49.27, were placed to his credit, and that he had, at that time, in his possession the company's receipt duly signed according to the privilege or proviso.\nI think the effect of that transaction was a payment by the assured to the company's agent of the premium on his policy, that is, a payment in money according to the terms of the policy.\nIt appears that Harrington did not send the money to the company, nor did he deliver the receipt to the assured, but attached it to the note. I think that makes no difference and that the premium was paid according to the terms of the policy.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Henry C.

VII. c. 104 (N.S.)\nBy statute in Nova Scotia if land is taken for railway purposes the compensation therefor, and for earth, gravel, etc., removed shall be fixed by arbitrators, one chosen by each party and the third, if required, by those two. A railway company intending to expropriate, their engineer wrote to M., who had acted for the company in other cases, instructing him to ascertain whether the owners had arranged their title so that the arbitration could proceed and, if so, to ask them to nominate their man who, with M., could appoint a third if they could not agree. The engineer added, \"I will send an agreement of arbitration which each one can subscribe to or, if they have one already drafted, you can forward it here for approval.\" No such agreement was sent by, or forwarded to, the engineer, but the three arbitrators were appointed and made an award on which the owners of the land brought an action.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (38 N.S. Rep. 80), that as the company had not taken the preliminary steps required by the statute which, therefore, did not govern the arbitration proceedings, the award was void for want of a proper submission.\nThe company entered upon land and cut down trees and removed gravel therefrom without giving the owners the notice required by statute of their intention to take their property. The owners, by their action above mentioned, claimed damages for trespass as well as the amount of the award.\nHeld, that as the act of the company was not authorized by statute the owners could sue for trespass and as, at the trial, the action on this claim was dismissed on the ground that such action was prohibited there should be a new trial. Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendants.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the above head note.\nNewcombe K.C. and Hellish K.C. for the appellants.\nDaniel McNeil and A. A. MacKay, for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and GIROUARD J. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I agree with the judgment of Russell J. and would allow the appeal and order a new trial.\nThe appellant company entered upon the plaintiffs' lands, cut down and carried away trees, excavated a gravel pit, and otherwise damaged the property.\nThey had a legal right to do all this provided they had proceeded under the statute authorizing the construction of the road and given the plaintiff the statutory notices of their intention to take his property.\nThey did not, however, do this and, therefore, in all that they did with respect to plaintiffs' lands they were trespassers only.\nIf they had given the necessary notices defining what property they intended to take and had entered and taken the property in assertion of that right I should have been inclined to hold that the letter of the railway company's engineer to Mr. Sinclair might be construed as a sufficient and complete appointment of the company's valuator or arbitrator. In that case the arbitration would have been under the statute which in connection with the notice would contain a complete submission, and define not only what the arbitrators were to value, but the method of procedure.\nI agree with Meagher J. that in such a case the latter words of the letter might be read as authorizing Mr. McKeen to\nmanage all the appraisal proceedings for them as well as to act as appraiser\nbecause there could not be then any doubt as to what property or damages the arbitrators were appraising.\nBut as the defendants had not given the necessary notices and the statute did not apply, and no submission of any kind was executed defining what the arbitrators were to value, whether the plaintiffs' lands taken by the company, if any were taken, or merely the damages caused by digging the gravel pit referred to in Sinclair's letter or the latter damages plus those caused by the trees cut down and destroyed, I cannot agree that there was any legal or binding arbitration or award; or that the letter could be construed as in itself an authority to act until there had been an agreement defining what the arbitrators were to value. But I have no doubt whatever of the plaintiffs' right to recover for all the damages they have sustained at the company's hands against the defendants as trespassers and which damages, I think, should have been assessed under the alternative claim of the plaintiff at the trial.\nWhile the appeal must be allowed with costs in this court our judgment should be the one which the court appealed from should have given, namely, that proposed by Russell J., the costs of the appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to be paid by the defendants and the costs of the first trial to be costs in the cause.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellants are a railway company, that by the law of Nova Scotia at the times in question had a right, upon giving of notice under the statute, to have done all that was done by them, and in question here.\nThey without such notice and without any other authority had entered upon respondents' lands and committed trespasses in the way of taking timber and gravel.\nSome talk took place, after some of these trespasses, between one of the respondents and the agent of the company, that indicates an intention to have an arbitration in respect of these trespasses and of further appropriations by the company of the respondents' property of both land and gravel, but nothing definite was arrived at.\nThere was nothing from which either party could not in law have receded. The respondents could have sued for the trespasses.\nThere was no express license for the continuation of such trespasses.\nThere was nothing passed between the parties that could in any way be said to have defined the extent to which the company had a right to go, or expected and intended to go.\nAbout a year later, on the 20th day of July, 1901, the appellants filed a plan by which they indicated an intention to expropriate the land in question, but the extent of their intended expropriation thereby disclosed did not cover all the land over which they had trespassed.\nThere were thus existing in law at the time when the alleged submission to an arbitration, which resulted in the award sued upon, was written, at least three distinctly separate claims, relative to which disputes might arise, and for settlement of which one or more arbitrations might furnish appropriate remedies; one for the trespasses done before anything passed between the parties, another for those done after the talk between them, for which there might be said to have been given, by one of the respondents, an assent that might possibly be held to have been as to him a license, to do what was done thereafter, but did not constitute a bargain between all the parties.\nThe damages, arising from these later acts thus assented to, could not be measured upon any principle of vindictive damages, though what arose from the earlier acts might, by reason of the high-handed methods adopted, well have such measure applied in regard to them.\nThen there was a third claim, for the price of, or compensation for the acquisition desired by the company, of the fee simple in the land, in respect of which the plan was filed.\nThere may not have been any such power of expropriating the fee simple as the company thought there was. There is no doubt a provision under which the company might have entered for the purposes of taking gravel, without seeking to acquire the fee simple in the land from which the gravel was to be taken.\nIt does not become necessary in the way this case strikes me to decide whether or not there was such a power of expropriation as the company believed there was.\nIt is sufficient for my present purpose to point out that this company, clearly in good faith, believed that they had such power of expropriation, and that it was in light of that belief that their agent carried on his negotiations with the respondents and proceeded to consider the business of the proposed arbitration when he wrote the letter I am about to quote.\nIf ever there existed need for a clear, comprehensive and well considered submission defining exactly what arbitrators were expected to pass upon, this remarkable jumble of a variety of causes of action, resulting from illegal and unbusinesslike acts of the company together with intentions to acquire property by virtue of such a proceeding, resting upon statute or agreement, seemed to demand it.\nYet we have an attempt made by this suit to rest an award, said to relate to some or all of these matters against the appellants, upon nothing but the following letter, written by an agent of appellants:\nToronto, Canada, March 31st, 1902.\nLewis McKeen, Esq., Mabou, C.B.;\nDear Sir,\u2014Will you please ascertain if the McIsaacs of Strathlorne have arranged their title to the ballast pit at Loch Ban in such a way that the arbitrators can get to work. If they have please let them know that you are prepared to act, and ask them to appoint their man so that you two if you cannot agree as to the valuation may select a third.\nDo nothing in the case of Dr. Gunn at present. I want to get the McIsaac's matter out of the way first, and then we can take up his claim afterwards. I will send an agreement of arbitration which each one can subscribe to, or if they have one already drafted, you can forward it here for approval. I expect to get away every week, but something turns up to keep me here, and you had better take the case up without me. Yours truly,\nDiet. A.S. Angus Sinclair. It seems that the man to whom the letter was addressed never answered it, but proceeded without further authority, with some one named by respondents, to nominate a third man. And the three, thus constituted so-called arbitrators, without notice to the company or hearing evidence or counsel or agent on behalf of the parties except the respondents, awarded that the appellants pay the respondents $957 together with $1.00 each to said arbitrators. The award is not before us. What it covers or purports to cover is left for us to guess until produced.\nThere is not the slightest doubt but that the company's agent who talked over the matter with the respondent Murdoch McIsaac intended to acquire the land, and that the arbitration he suggested was to cover that acquisition.\nHis evidence shews that, and is not contradicted.\nThe plan filed would indicate that also.\nThe pleadings indicate that the award was in relation to what had been taken from the land, or injury to the land, but not the value of the land itself.\nThere is no means of being certain from the evidence whether the arbitrators considered land, or gravel and damage to land, as combined in submission and award.\nIt seems abundantly clear from the letter quoted that the title to the land had been in question and was present to the writer's mind.\nThe terms of the letter itself, and the facts, may indicate that land as well as gravel were to have been considered.\nIt seems hopeless to try and support any such award upon a submission so clearly indicating that it was not a final document, but that if the respondents would name a man a proper submission would be drawn up and signed.\nIt is useless to try, as was urged, to reject the latter part of the letter or to impute it only to matters concerning Dr. Gunn and his claim.\nThis latter part of the letter refers to the possibility that \"they have one already drafted\" and if they had \"you can forward it here for approval.\"\nBut as the proposal on the writer's part, to send an agreement of arbitration, comes after the interjected sentence, \"Do nothing in the case of Dr. Gunn at present,\" we are asked to attribute these later remarks to Dr. Gunn's business and not to that of the respondents.\nI strongly dissent from that proposed method of interpreting a document.\nBut for this argument, and what appears in the court below, I would not have thought it possible to claim any but the one meaning for this letter, and that clearly to be, as I certainly never have doubted it meant, to have proper articles of agreement settled before proceeding at all with arbitration.\nSurely the consideration the parties had in mind, those the so-called arbitrators bore in mind, and the numerous legal difficulties surrounding the relations of the parties in regard to this property, ought to have been thought of by all concerned before adopting this kind of authority for the disposal of such matters in difference as had arisen between those parties.\nI am quite sure a moment's consideration of all those things would have stayed those arbitrators. Such methods of arbitration as they adopted ought not to be encouraged.\nThe judgment on this award ought to be set aside and judgment be entered for plaintiffs in respect of the trespasses and the case go back for assessment of the damages arising from such trespasses with costs of appeal to the company here and possibly in the court below, and costs of the action and of the reference to be in the discretion of the judge who assesses the damages.\nI do not, however, dissent from the disposition made of the costs.\nMACLENNAN J. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W. H. Fulton.\nSolicitor for the respondents: J. D. Matheson.\n[1] 38 N.S. Rep. 80.\n",

And I do hereby appoint my brother, Donald McIsaac, and my brother-in-law, Donald McIsaac, tailor, my executors to carry out this my last will and testament.\"\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (38 N.S. Rep. 60), that the widow took the real estate in fee with power to dispose of it and the personalty whenever she deemed it was for the benefit of herself and her children, to do so.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe only question to be decided by this appeal was as to the construction of the will set out in the head note. The plaintiff was a son of the testator who claimed that the widow only took a life estate in the realty and defendant's title derived from her was defective. The Statute of Limitations was pleaded as to which plaintiff claimed that it began to run only from the date of his mother's death, at which time he was residing out of the province and only returned shortly before his action was commenced.\nA. A. MacKay for the appellant. We contend that Margaret McIsaac took only an estate for life in the property, with a power of appointment among the children, and that all she conveyed to Donald Beaton was this estate for life. The words \"to be by her disposed of amongst my beloved children as she may judge most beneficial to herself and them\" create what is known as a power in the nature of a trust. It is a power of appointment among the children. Though testator is providing that his estate shall go to his children, there is no gift to them, except in or by means of the power; there is no gift to the children in express terms, and no estate vests in them until the power is exercised. In default of the exercise of the power the estate vests in all the children equally, on the death of the donee of the power. Smith's Principles of Equity, pp. 42, 43 and 44; Jarman on Wills, p. 372; Crockett v. Crockett[2]; Godfrey v. Godfrey[3]; Bibby v. Thompson[4]; Hart v. Tribe[5]; Newill v. Newill[6]; Booth v. Booth[7]; Theobald on Wills (4 ed.), pp. 475-6, 384-387. The words are apt and imperative; she has no discretion except that allowed her by the will. \"To be paid\" in an agreement creates a covenant to pay. Bower v. Hodges[8]. \"To be settled,\" creates an executory trust. Ballance v. Lanphier[9]. The objects of the disposition are limited and not within her control; \"amongst my children.\" She has a discretion as to the time and manner of the disposition, and takes an interest herself, and it follows that as she may postpone that disposition until it is impossible to make it, that is at her death, she takes an estate for life. Lambe v. Eames[10], and cases of that class are clearly distinguishable as there the words were \"to be at her disposal in any way she may think it best for the benefit of herself and family.\" Her discretion was unlimited in every direction, and she, therefore, took the fee simple. Curnick v. Tucker[11]; LeMarchant v. LeMarchant[12].\nThis case is not that of an executor exercising an implied power of sale, nor is it the case of a devisee exercising an implied power of sale for the payment of debts. Robinson v. Lowater[13]; Theobald on Wills (6 ed.), p. 433; Dart on Vendors and Purchasers (7 ed.), p. 635.\nUnder the direction to pay debts the personalty should have been exhausted before recourse could be had to the real estate. Williams on Executors (10 ed.) 1315 et seq. The direction, if a charge, only charges the real estate when the personal property is insufficient to pay the debts. At the time of this sale the statute in relation to such sales, R.S.N.S. (2ser.), ch. 139, secs. 13-18, provided that undevised real estate should be sold first under license from the Court of Probate, unless it appeared that a different arrangement was intended by the testator, in which case the provisions of the will were to be complied with. There is no evidence that there were any debts rendering a sale necessary. The testator left personal property, and seems to have been a well-to-do farmer, in those days.\nSection 19, ch. 167, R.S.N.S., 1900, does not bar the plaintiff's right to recover. The right of entry accrued in 1882, the plaintiff was then out of the province and only returned about 1902, and he had ten years from the time of his return in which to bring the action. Darby & Bosanquet, Statutes of Limitations (2 ed.) 322. We also rely upon Evans v. Evans[14]; Talbot v. O'Sullivan[15]; Combe v. Hughes[16]; Ramsden v. Hassard[17]; and Elphinstone on Deeds, p. 40, Rule IX. and notes.\nMellish K.C. and Jamieson for the respondents. The plaintiff's claim is barred by the Statute of Limitations, R.S.N.S. 1900, secs. 10, 18, 19 and 27. The respondent contends that the appellant's right of action first accrued either under section 10 (b), on the death of the testator when his children were entitled to have the property divided, or under section 27, when the widow sold the lands in 1860. In either case the plaintiff cannot recover under section 19.\nThe property is charged with the testator's debts and devised to the widow so charged \"to be by her disposed of amongst my beloved children as she may judge most beneficial for herself and them.\" This devise conferred upon the widow a power of sale to pay the debts. Theobald on Wills (6 ed.), p. 432, and cases there cited; Marshall v. Gingell[18]; Brooke v. Brooke[19]. The widow presumably sold the lands in exercise of that power and there is some evidence that the proceeds were used to pay testator's debts. It is, however, for the plaintiff to shew that the sale by the widow was wrongful to the knowledge of the purchaser. Colyer v. Finch[20].\nThe words of the will by which the lands are devised \"to be by her disposed of amongst my beloved children as she may judge most beneficial for herself and them\" taken alone either create the widow merely a trustee for the children; Blakeney v. Blakeney[21]; Theobald on Wills (6 ed.), p. 476; in which case the plaintiff's right of action would have first accrued when the widow conveyed the land to Donald Beaton (section 27), or the words merely mean that the lands are to be disposed of by the widow as she may judge most beneficial for herself and children\u2014in which case she would have a clear power of sale. There is no authority for the proposition that the widow took a life interest under the will.\nThe plaintiff is neither in possession nor in constructive possession of the lands sought to be partitioned herein and cannot maintain this action. An action by partition is not a substitute for an action in ejectment. Bennetto v. Bennetto.[22].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and GIROUARD J. were of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The question in this appeal is as to the construction of a will made by Archibald McIsaac who died in 1858, which will was in the following words:\nI give and bequeath to my beloved wife, Margaret McIsaac, all and singular the property of which I am possessed, whether real or personal, or wheresoever situated, to be by her disposed of amongst my beloved children as she may judge most beneficial to her and them, and also order that all my just and lawful debts shall be paid out of the same.\nMcIsaac was a poor farmer living in Cape Breton and at the time of his death owned a farm of 100 acres worth about $600 and a very small stock of cattle together with a few other chattels. He left a widow and nine children in very poor circumstances, and owed some debts, the amount of which was unproved.\nThe contention on the part of the appellant was that under this will the widow only took a life estate with a trust in favour of the children, and his counsel admitted that unless that construction prevailed the appeal must fail.\nThe trial judge held in favour of appellant's contention, and gave judgment in his favour. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, on appeal, reversed this judgment, Townshend and Meagher JJ. holding that the widow took an estate in fee simple under the will and in any case had power to sell the land in consequence of the charge upon it of the testator's debts, while Russell J. agreed in the result, but based his judgment upon the implied power to sell arising out of the charge of the debts.\nThe case is one by no means free from difficulty and I have entertained a good deal of doubt as to the true meaning of the will. As was said by Chief Justice May in Talbot v. O'Sullivan[23], at p. 308:\nThe authorities upon the construction of wills of this class are extremely numerous and not probably capable of being reconciled, and the decisions properly depend in each case upon the particular language used in the will to be interpreted.\nI have, after an examination of the authorities and much reflection upon the language of this will, reached the conclusion that the reasoning of Townshend J. concurred in by Meagher J. as to its true meaning, should prevail.\nThe two leading authorities, Lambe v. Eames, in appeal[24], and Howorth v. Dewell[25], relied on by the learned judge in support of his position are, I think, very applicable, and difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish. I only desire to add a few words as to the intention which ought to be drawn from the somewhat enigmatical language of the will in question. It must be admitted that where the will begins with an absolute gift in order to cut it down, the latter part of the will must shew as clear an intention to cut down the absolute gift as the first part does to make it. Now here, the words of the will in the first part are absolute and unqualified, and if the will had stopped at the words \"wherever situated,\" it would not be open to any argument that the widow took an estate in fee simple of the lands and the personal property absolutely. Now what are the words which can satisfy us that this estate was cut down? They are attempted to be discovered in the words\nto be disposed of amongst my children as she may judge most beneficial to her and them.\nBut the courts would not and could not undertake to execute any trust arising out of words such as these. They were the expression of his personal and absolute confidence in his wife. How could the court declare any disposition amongst the children which they might think proper to be such a disposition as the testator had in mind when he said \"as she might judge most beneficial to her and them.\" She alone and not the court was to make the determination. Whether circumstances might arise in which she could be called to account for a breach of trust we have not now to decide. But I cannot find in the words quoted any justifying a conclusion that the estate devised in the first part of the will was cut down in the latter part, much less that a specific and limited estate for life was created.\nPerhaps a good way to test the question is to apply it to the personalty. The same language is used in the will with respect to the personal property as with respect to the real estate. If that language creates an estate for life in the widow in the land it also limits her rights in the personal property to its user for life and prevents any sale of it. The widow could not sell, but must divide the property in specie amongst the children. Would such an argument applied to the personal property be reasonable? Would it not be destructive of the very object the testator had in mind? Not a horse or a cart or farm implement could be sold. They might be used by the widow, but must at her death be divided amongst the children in specie. She could not sell and apply the proceeds for their maintenance and support if she deemed that method \"most beneficial to her and them,\" as specified in the will.\nThe application of the rule contended for to the personalty seems to me to illustrate its weakness more forcibly than when applied to the realty. But I quite concur that it was the full intention of the testator, and that he has sufficiently expressed it, to give his widow the absolute right to sell all or any part of the property devised and to apply the proceeds\namongst the children as she thought most beneficial to herself and them. In the view I take of this will, that the absolute estate granted to the widow in the first part of the devise is not cut down by the subsequent words, and that these words do not, under the authorities above referred to, constitute a trust which a court of equity either should or would administer, in this view I say it is not necessary for me to consider either the Statute of Limitations or the point on which Russell J. relied in his judgment. That point was, and it was also adopted and relied on by Townshend and Meagher JJ., that the direction or order of the testator for the payment of his debts out of the real and personal property devised constituted a charge upon the lands and gave the devisee a power of sale over them. If it was necessary for me to consider this point I should require further time, because the two leading cases in the House of Lords relied on as authority for the proposition are cases in which the devisee of the lands charged was also executor of the will. In the latest case in the House of Lords of Corser v. Cartwright[26] Lord Cairns said at page 737:\nMy Lords, for the sake of caution I ought to observe that in Coyler v. Finch[27], as in the case before your Lordships, the devisee of the real estate charged with the payment of debts was also an executor; and I desire not to apply any observation which I am now addressing to your Lordships to the case of a stranger, that is to say a person who is not an executor, being devisee of estates charged with the payment of debts.\nIn the case at bar the widow was such stranger, being devisee of the lands, but not executor of the will.\nThe late case of Re Bailey[28]. shews that the power of sale is not necessarily implied even when lands are devised to executors and his testator directs that his debts shall be paid by them, but that it is a question of intention to be collected from the whole will.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014It is, I admit, possible to distinguish the words, or literal meaning of the phrase, used in the devise in the will in question here from that in the case of Lambe v. Eames[29].\nIf one does not feel bound, as he might, in regard to what was known to be a carefully drawn document, to adhere to the literal meaning, of every word, but rather seeks to ascertain the intention of the testator by observing the general scope and purpose of the will, in light of the surrounding facts and circumstances, I think this case is not distinguishable from that just cited.\nIt is quite possible, by the same method of interpretation, to accept the alternative adopted by Mr. Justice Russell, and there may possibly be open, though I am not inclined to think so, the other alterative, to read it as a devise so charged that the person accepting it became bound to satisfy the charge and incidentally thereto be empowered to sell. In any of these alternatives the result here would be the same.\nEvery effort made, during the ingenious argument presented to us, to extract some meaning from the words in question other than one of these alternatives, when tested by the supreme test of the intention of the testator sought out in the way I indicate above, seems to me to fail to produce anything that one could seriously think was like unto what it was possible the testator could have intended.\nEvery case relied upon to support each of these other interpretations, so proposed by counsel, is easily and clearly distinguishable from this case. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMacLennan J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe question is whether the gift by the testator's will to his wife of his real and personal estate enabled her to sell and make a good title to his farm; or whether, if that be doubtful, the plaintiff, one of the children of the testator, can recover the farm after forty-four years' uninterrupted possession by the purchaser and his assigns.\nThe gift is as follows:\nI give and bequeath to my beloved wife Margaret McIsaac, all and singular the property of which I am possessed whether real or personal or wheresoever situated, to be by her disposed of amongst my beloved children as she may judge most beneficial to her and them, and also order that all my just and lawful debts shall be paid out of the same.\nIn and by the same will he appointed his brother and brother-in-law his executors, \"to carry out this my last will and testament,\" but he assigned to them no other duty.\nThe testator was a farmer, owner of a farm of 100 acres, and was possessed of some farm stock and implements. He had a family of nine young children. The land was of no great value, and only brought $600 when sold sixteen months after his death. He owed some debts, and there is some evidence that while the family remained on the farm they were to some extent dependent on neighours for assistance.\nThe testator died in 1858, and in 1860 the widow sold and conveyed the land to a person under whom the defendant derives his title. The plaintiff is one of the children of the testator, and claims that under the will his mother was tenant for life, and her children tenants in remainder in fee, and that upon his mother's death on the 3rd of April, 1882, he became seized of an estate in possession in fee simple.\nHe avoids the defence of the Statute of Limitations by saying that when his right of action first accrued, at the death of his mother in 1882, he was resident without the province, and so continued until within a short time before he commenced his action.\nNow the first thing to be observed is that beyond any question the legal title of the testator's farm vested in the widow under the will. She took the legal fee simple in the land, and whatever beneficial interest in the land was intended to be given, or was given, to the children was in the nature of a trust. The personal estate is given in the same terms, but other persons being named executors the property in the personal estate would not vest in the widow absolutely until the debts were paid. Subject to that, the legal property in the personal estate would be in her absolutely, upon the same trust as that resting upon the land. Now the trust of both kinds of property being the same, the court must put such a construction upon that trust as will best accord with its terms and with the nature of both kinds of property, and with the reasonable and probable intention of the testator having regard to the circumstances of his property and his family. The widow is given the title of both kinds of property in the most unqualified manner, and she is to dispose of it as she may judge most beneficial to her and them. But it is said she must dispose of it amongst the children. I attach importance to the word \"dispose,\" which is a large word, larger than divide. Applying it to the personal estate, it is easy to say it means to sell and apply the proceeds as she might judge most beneficial to herself and her children. In short, she was to dispose of everything both real and personal, to see that all just debts were paid, and to apply what was left for the benefit of herself and her children according to her best judgment.\nI think the reasoning of the court in Lambe v. Eames[30] entirely applicable to this case, and that the proper construction of the will is that it gave the widow not only the legal title in fee simple in this land, but also an absolute power to dispose of it, as well as of the personal estate, if and when, in her judgment, it was for the benefit of herself and her numerous helpless children to do so.\nIn the foregoing view of the case it is unnecessary to consider the defence of the Statute of Limitations. But it being, as I think it is, quite impossible to hold that the will gave the widow the beneficial interest for life and the children an interest only at her death; and on the contrary, it being plain that the children as well as the mother were intended to have an immediate beneficial interest in both lands and goods, it follaws that if the widow had no power to sell the wrong done to the children was done by the sale and conveyance.\nIt is impossible to contend upon the language of the will that the children were not to have any immediate benefit, or that their mother could turn them all adrift, and take all the use and benefit of the property both real and personal for her own exclusive use for life.\nIf that be so the plaintiff's cause of action arose when the sale and conveyance was made on the 5th of April. 1860, and is barred by section 19 of the Statute of Limitations.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Jos.

Shortly afterwards the son with the widow and other heirs conveyed away four of the sixty acres and nearly thirty years later they were deeded to McD. Under a judgment against the executors of McI. the sixty acres were sold by the sheriff and fifty including the said four were conveyed by the purchaser to McI.'s son. The sheriff's sale was illegal under the Nova Scotia law. The son lived on the fifty acres for a time and then went to the United States, leaving his mother and sister in occupation until he returned twenty years later. During this time he occasionally cut hay on the four acres, which was only partly enclosed, and let his cattle pasture on it. In an action for a declaration of title to the four acres:\nHeld, that the occupation by the son under colour of title of the fifty acres was not constructive possession of the four which he had conveyed away and his alleged acts of ownership over which were merely intermittent acts of trespass.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nThe facts are sufficiently set out in the above head note.\nNewcombe K.C. for the appellant.\nAlexander McDonald, for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE and GIROUARD J. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014But for the strong opinion expressed by Townshend J. as to the rights acquired by the defendant by the application of the principle of constructive possession I should not have entertained the slightest doubt upon this case.\nIn deference to that opinion I have carefully examined the evidence and weighed the arguments advanced for the defendant.\nAll the alleged general acts of possession on the block of land occupied by the defendant and his mother, brothers and sisters may well be held applicable alone to such part of the fifty acres as they admittedly own.\nThe isolated and intermittent entries upon the vacant and unenclosed four acres in dispute which they had sold and conveyed to the predecessor in title of the plaintiff cannot be held to be anything else than mere acts of trespass.\nTo apply the doctrine of constructive possession to such a case as this and to extend it to the four acres which the defendant, his mother, brothers and sisters had sold and conveyed for valuable consideration and by warranty deed to the plaintiff's grantor, and to do this under colour of a void deed which on its very face relates back to and professes to convey to defendant's vendor amongst other lands the very lands which the defendant, his mother, brothers and sisters had already sold and conveyed to the plaintiff's vendor and the title to which they had warranted, would, it seems to me, be not only introducing a novel and indefensible extension of the doctrine, but one destructive of the plainest principles of law and equity. I agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant seeks to establish title to four acres of land by virtue of the Statute of Limitations in force in Nova Scotia.\nThe evidence of actual and continuous possession entirely fails to support the appellant's contention unless he can rely, as he seeks to do, upon an alleged constructive possession he sets up.\nHis father devised to him certain lands and by virtue of such devise he entered into possession of the same, and whilst in such possession he sold and conveyed the part thereof, which comprises the four acres now in dispute, to the person through whom respondent claims.\nIn this conveyance dated 9th Oct., 1877, the heirs at law, and legatees given by the will certain interests charged by the will upon the said devise, joined as grantors. The appellant and these other grantors covenanted as follows, in said deed of conveyance, that they\nthe said lot of land and premises against the lawful claims and demands of all and every person and persons whomsoever will warrant and forever defend.\nA creditor of the testator recovered judgment against the executors of said will, and thereupon the sheriff, by virtue of an alleged writ of execution, pretended to sell and convey the whole of the lands of the testator to one Gillis, in 1880.\nThe appellant being in possession saw fit, rather than have any contest with Gillis, to take from him a deed purporting to convey fifty acres of said land. This land now in question was by the description in said last-mentioned deed comprised in the said fifty acres.\nThe sheriff's sale is now conceded to have been null and void and to have conveyed nothing, and the deed from Gillis to the appellant falls with it.\nThe rather startling proposition is put forward that the original possession, continued by the appellant, had the effect of giving such vitality to the deed as to enable the appellant to claim as law, that his continuing in undisturbed and undoubted possession of part of the land covered by this void deed must be held as giving him a constructive possession also of the four acres in question over which he occasionally exercised some sporadic acts of ownership, such as cutting marsh hay on it, and letting his cattle roam over it, as others might, and probably did, for it was only partially fenced about.\nHe says this constructive possession was such as to satisfy the possession required to acquire title by virtue of the Statute of Limitations.\nManifestly there are two complete answers to this pretension.\nThere must be shewn in every case of constructive possession something done by him claiming it, under and pursuant to the defective or void deed relied upon, to enable the grantee to ask the court to interpret his acts of possession as intended to extend to or have a relation to all the property comprised in such deed.\nThe entry under such a defective or void deed upon one part of the whole described as conveyed thereby has been taken as indicating a purpose to enter upon the whole and the acts of possession, following such an entry, need not extend to every part and corner of the lot thus dealt with, to shew such an actual physical use thereof as when a trespasser enters and claims to have acquired title by length of possession.\nThe reason for this is obvious and need not be laboured with. How can anything of this sort ever be attributed to a void deed under which the grantee did nothing? He made no entry for he was already in as devisee and never in law and in fact held in any other character.\nNo matter however adroitly he may answer questions on the point, there is left nothing else to rely upon.\nAgain, how can he claim anything as arising from this deed? How could he who would, if the deed which rested on the title of the father had been valid, and cut out the grant he had made to the respondent's vendor, have been compellable, under his warranty covenant, to have reconveyed to the respondent or his grantor all he had got under such a deed, set up what if valid would have been in breach of his own covenant?\nIn the definition of constructive possession good faith is sometimes included, and in any event is one of the elements it must rest upon. This supposed violation of his covenant in the case I put does not seem to be a very sound basis upon which to rest a claim that must have good faith to support it.\nIt seems from the effect we are asked to give to this void deed as if it were to be held a case of nothing being more valuable than something.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal with costs. Appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Frank A. McEchen.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Alexander McDonald.\n",

Order XXXII, r. 3\u2014Judicial discretion\u2014Statute of limitations.\nBy his last will N. bequeathed shares of his estate to his daughters A. and C. and appointed A. executrix and trustee. C. was weak-minded and infirm and her share was directed to be invested for her benefit and the revenue paid to her half-yearly. A. proved the will, assumed the management of both shares and also the support and care of C. at their common domicile, and applied their joint incomes to meet the general expenses. No detailed accounts were kept sufficient to comply with the terms of the trust nor to shew the amounts necessarily expended for the support, care and attendance of C., but A. kept books which shewed the general household expenses and consisted, principally, of admissions against her own interests. After the decease of both A. and C. the plaintiffs obtained a reference to a master to ascertain the amount of the residue of the estate coming to C. (who survived A.) and the receipts and expenditures by A. on account of C. On receiving the report the judge referred it back to be varied, with further instructions and a direction that the books kept by A. should be admitted as prim\u00e2, facie evidence of the matters therein contained. (See 37 N.S. Rep. pp. 452-464). This order was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (37 N.S. Rep. 451) that the allowances for such expenditures need not be restricted to amounts actually shewn to have been so expended; that, under the Nova Scotia statute, 2 Edw. VII., ch. 13 and Order XXXII., rule 3, a judge may exercise judicial discretion towards relieving a trustee from liability for technical breaches of trust and, for that purpose, may direct the admission of any evidence which he may deem proper for the taking of accounts.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the order of Mr. Justice Graham, which referred the master's report back to him for further inquiry and variation with directions as to how the accounts should be taken and as to the reception of certain books of account as prima facie evidence of matters therein contained.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue on the present appear are sufficiently stated in the head note and judgment now reported.\nNewcombe K.C. and Mellish K.C. for the appellants.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and GIROUARD J. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs for the reasons given in the court below.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur for the reasons stated by my brother Maclennan.\nIDINGTON J\u2014Four points: (a) the additional allowance of $400.00 per annum for expenses out of income; (b) the commission allowances; (c) the statute of limitations and; (d) the admission of the account books as evidence, are taken on this appeal, which is from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, dismissing an appeal from Mr. Justice Graham's order referring back to the referee his report for amendment and reconsideration. The order, as first made, was amended by the learned judge, and, as amended, is copied in full in the opinion judgment of Mr. Justice Townshend, who delivered the judgment of the court, and, hence, there cannot be any possible mistake in saying that this amended order was the order appealed from to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and fully considered by that court and upheld. And, as a result, the terms of that amended order thus adopted by the court below are all that is now before us to pass upon.\nThe first of the four points is the only important one. The master allowed only $500 a year for the support and maintenance by the late Antoinette Nordbeck of her late sister, Caroline Nordbeck, who had an income exceeding the amount of the $900.00 a year that Mr. Justice Graham has allowed.\nShe was kept, though of feeble mind, in the condition of affluence and comfort that she was entitled to be kept in, having such income.\nThe sister who did all this was the executrix, was a capable person, and doubtless used the incomes of herself and sister as if both held in common. She did not keep such accounts as a banker might have done, but kept such accounts as do shew a general annual expenditure in this way of living, and as may fairly be said to have benefited the feeble sister to the extent the learned judge has allowed.\nThe contention is set up that because Antoinette did not keep and exhibit an account in detail, and hence was unable to prove, item by item, the actual expenses (specifically so to say applicable, and applied to the direct benefit of Caroline) she must not be allowed beyond what she can shew items for.\nI know of no such rule of law as will require any court to restrict the allowances for expenditure in such cases within what can be shewn in that way to have been expended.\nIf the law be so then we might go further, and say the very cheapest mode of living ought to be adopted in all such cases because the quasi ward is unable to have and express an opinion, and entitled to have all her money saved except what is needed for bare subsistence, and she is to be presumed as not having been capable of enjoying life better, by reason of the surrounding comforts that a spacious, well kept house and grounds might afford, and the corresponding equipment of such a house, and all that can be implied therein.\nThe lot of such trustees as this Antoinette Nordbeck had by fate given her, is always hard enough, without adding a new terror to the lives of those who have to bear such burthens.\nShe spent for the living of herself and her sister. She did not make money out of the incomes of both or either.\nHer father, by his will, clearly indicated she was trusted by him to do almost as she pleased, and not to be charged in the way sought to charge her here.\nI have not the slightest doubt she did in regard to the manner of expending the incomes just what her father would have approved of.\nThe court below used the evidence in the account books, kept by the executrix, and by that means was able to make an allowance that possibly the referee could not have made.\nUnless and until the court or a judge directs a referee to make use of such account book he cannot, as in Ontario, for example, where the master has the power given him, which in Nova Scotia is only reposed in the court, or a judge. The learned judge went further, and by use of that, with other evidence, fixed, as the learned judge had a right to fix, what he found all that evidence enabled him to find and fix.\nI see no reason to interfere with that finding.\nIn all these cases the judge, who has had a chance of knowing the local conditions, is better able to appreciate properly such evidence as we have before us than we possibly can.\nThe learned judge may have allowed more even than I, if on the spot and acquainted with the local conditions, might have allowed on this evidence.\nEven so, I would not reverse, unless satisfied that by no reasonable inference from the evidence, could the expenditure challenged have been imputed to the support and maintenance of the weak one, in such ways as would minister to her comfort and enjoyment of life; or that the income had been improperly exceeded or misapplied.\nThe use of the books as evidence was purely a matter of discretion and what I have written disposes of all that need be said in relation to its exercise.\nSome commission seems clearly allowable and is so as far as directed; but the measure of it may on the facts be affected by what the evidence shews, and will, when fixed, be subject to review by the judge or court below.\nThe statute of limitations, of which we heard so much, is as yet not in this appeal. The referee may or may not find such facts as may render the statute operative.\nWhen he does the judge and court below will no doubt deal properly in regard to it, for it was pleaded, but not passed upon, by the record of judgment, and would seem open in law for future disposition if need be.\nThe appellants have failed on all four points taken and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nMacLennan J.\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiffs in an administration suit, from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Graham J. referring the case back to the referee to review and vary his report.\nThe action respects the estate of Peter Nordbeck, who died in January or February, 1861, having first made his will bearing date the 9th of October, 1860, of which he appointed his daughter Antoinette executrix. The testator left an estate estimated at about \u00a315,000, Nova Scotia currency. He left him surviving besides Antoinette, two other daughters, Eleonora and Caroline, and these were his own children. Eleonora was then the wife of one Harley, and she and her husband are now dead. Four children and three grandchildren of Mrs. Harley are plaintiffs; and the defendants are the executors of Antoinette, who died in 1898, aged 84 years. One of the plaintiffs is administratrix of Mrs. Harley, and another is administratrix of Caroline, who died in January, 1902, aged 80 years.\nAfter providing for his daughter, Mrs. Harley, the testator devised his dwelling house on Brunswick Street, with all the furniture and effects contained therein, to Antoinette for her own absolute use, but subject to the free and unrestricted use and occupation of the same by Caroline for life. He then gave his residue to Antoinette and Caroline equally, share and share alike, with a direction that Caroline's share should be invested by Antoinette, and that the income should be paid half-yearly to her for life, and at her death to her children, if any, and if she died unmarried her share should be divided equally between Antoinette and Mrs. Harley. The will provides for the case of Antoinette or Caroline marrying and leaving children surviving them, but they both died without having been married. The judgment at the hearing determined that Mrs. Harley's children became entitled between them to one-fourth of the testator's residue upon the death of Caroline, and that determination is now acquiesced in. The judgment then directed certain accounts and inquiries to be taken and made. But, except as to the proportions or shares of the residue to which the plaintiffs were declared to be entitled, the judgment decided nothing whatever as to the rights or liabilities of the parties, nor was any authority given to the referee to decide or declare any such rights or liabilities.\nFurther directions were reserved, and also liberty to apply.\nThe referee made his report, with statements of the several accounts directed by the judgment, and finding the half of the residue, with interest computed thereon from the testator's death, including the value of existing securities, and the dividends paid thereon to amount to $49,653. He also found that a proper allowance for the maintenance of Caroline from the death of her father until her own death was the sum of $20,500. He also computed income and interest subsequent to her death at $1,092.\nThe plaintiffs moved before Mr. Justice Graham to confirm this report, and the defendants moved to vary it, and the learned judge delivered a very extended opinion in which he referred it back, with directions to vary it. An order to that effect was drawn up bearing date the 17th of December, 1904. The plaintiffs immediately appealed against this order to the Supreme Court, and while the appeal was pending Mr. Justice Graham re-cast the order of the 17th of December, varying it a good deal in form, and this amended order was duly drawn up and issued, bearing date the 27th of January, 1905.\nA very earnest contention was made before us that the amended order was void, and that the learned judge had no power to make an alteration in his order after it had been issued.\nI have carefully perused and considered the learned judge's written opinion, on which the orders were founded, and have, also compared the substance of the two orders, and I am clearly of opinion that the second order more fully and completely follows and carries out the learned judge's written opinion than the first. The main difference is in the form. It is hard to say there is any difference of substance, except the direction, in the second order, of an inquiry whether the trustee acted honestly and reasonably within the Trustee Act and ought to be excused. But that is something to which, in his written opinion, the learned judge had made distinct reference and the omission of which from the first order drawn up was a good reason for having it re-drawn. Another difference may be noted, that while the first order enables the referee to determine whether to apply the Statute of Limitations, the amended order reserves that power to the court.\nIt was also argued that there was some inconsistency between the order under appeal and the order made by the learned judge at the trial. I do not think this is so. It was said that the order or judgment at the trial expressly excluded the application of the Statute of Limitations. It is true that in his written opinion the learned judge had expressed himself so; but that is omitted from the order as issued, and in such cases the order as drawn up and issued must govern, unless and until corrected or amended. Besides, the judgments at the trial, as I have pointed out, did no more than direct certain accounts to be taken, without in any way deciding the rights or liabilities of the parties in respect to them, and reserved further directions and liberty to apply.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that there is nothing in any of these objections.\nThe question then remains, whether on the merits the order was rightly affirmed by the Supreme Court, and I think it was.\nI cannot imagine a case in which the modern remedial legislation with respect to the onerous, and often thankless, duties of trustees ought with more propriety to be applied, if that can fairly and justly be done. Here were two daughters, spinsters, the one thirty-eight and the other forty-six years old. Their father dying gives his dwelling and all its furniture and contents to the elder, absolutely, subject to the free and unrestricted use thereof by the younger for life. The father evidently contemplated and provided for just what has taken place, for they lived together for thirty-eight years afterwards until the elder died, aged eighty-four, the younger being then seventy-six. According to the evidence the younger sister was not a person of strong mind, and evidently required the care and protection of her sister, but she was by no means lunatic or non compos. That is manifest from her father's will in which he provided that the interest of her share should be paid to her, and also contemplated the possibility of her marriage. It is not suggested, nor is it possible to believe, that these sisters lived together, for those many years, otherwise than in mutual confidence and affection, and yet it is sought, without the means of knowing all that passed between them in relation to their business affairs, to settle accounts between their estates as if the elder had been defrauding her younger sister every day of her life.\nA point which was strongly argued was the increase directed by the order of the learned judge of the annual allowance to be made for Caroline's maintenance from |500 to $900 a year. I think there is evidence which warrants that increase, and that the judgment on that point should not be disturbed.\nI think there is nothing else in the judgments appealed from to which objection can be successfully urged and the judgment should, therefore, in my opinion, be maintained, and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W. E. Fulton.\nSolicitor for the respondents: John A. McKinnon.\n[1] 37 N.S. Rep. 451.\n",

K. and F., two members of the firm, refused their assent to the terms of this resolution and declared their intention, of which the majority of the directors were made aware, to retire from the firm. F. subsequently wrote to the president and another director reiterating her intention to retire and declared that she would not be responsible for any further liability. The company afterwards took over the business of the firm, paying therefor $30,000 and receiving assets worth $12,000, and having eventually gone into liquidation the liquidator brought an action to recover from the members of the firm the difference. The Court of Appeal held that K. and F. were not liable though their partners were.\nHeld, that K. and F., having received the benefit of the money paid by the company, were also liable to repay the loss.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment at the trial against the respondents.\nThe plaintiff is liquidator of the Pakenham Pork Packing Co., Limited, which purchased and took over a pork packing business carried on at Stouffville under the name and style of the Pakenham Pork Packing Company. This business had been carried on for some years by the defendant James Pakenham, under the above mentioned trade name, and was so continued until the 2nd of December, 1901. On that day a partnership was formed between the defendants for the carrying on of the business, the partnership to continue for six months subject to an earlier determination in case of the consummation of certain arrangements between the defendant Pakenham and two trustees for the Pakenham Pork Packing Company, Limited.\nThe Limited Company was incorporated on the 13th of June, 1901, by letters of incorporation under the Ontario Companies Act.\nAmong the incorporators were the defendants Pakenham, Byer and Kendrick, and one H.J. Morden, who was then the local manager of the Standard Bank at Stouffville. The company was empowered to carry on the business of packing, curing and dealing in pork and other meats and the various products thereof, and for these purposes to acquire the plant, business, assets and good-will of the partnership. There were five provisional directors, of whom Pakenham, Byer and Morden were three.\nAt this time the partnership business was being carried on by Pakenham alone, and he had on the 20th of May, 1901, entered into an agreement with Messrs. Stouffer & Coulson, of Stouffville, brokers, as trustees for the limited company to be formed, to sell, assign and transfer to the limited company all the machinery, plant and good-will of the partnership business, and to transfer the lease of the premises in which the business was carried on in consideration of $20,000 in cash, and $10,000 in fully paid up stock in the limited company.\nThe limited company did not organize until the 2nd of April, 1902. On that day the shareholders held their first meeting, elected directors and transacted other business.\nBefore that date, however, a partnership had been formed between the defendants Pakenham, Byer, Kendrick and Mrs. Forsythe, upon terms contained in articles of partnership dated December 2nd, 1901, and executed by all the parties. The purpose was to carry on the existing business in the same premises under the same name, but apparently there was no grant to the partnership of any of Pakenham\u2019s property engaged in the business further than that he agreed to give them the use of the machinery in the factory free of charge.\nThe capital of the firm was declared to be $10,500, represented by a line of credit arranged with the Standard Bank, to be secured to the bank by a joint note of the parties, and for such other sums as might be agreed upon. The profits and losses were to be divided and borne in equal shares.\nIt was further agreed that the partnership should continue for six months, unless terminated under a provision whereby, when the limited company so requested, the firm would hand over to the company the factory, plant, business and good-will of the business, free and clear of all cost and charge, and thereupon the partnership should be wound up and after payment of debts the profits, if any, should be divided among the partners share and share alike.\nIt appeared from the agreement, and was further shewn by the testimony, that all that the partnership possessed when entering into business was the right to use the premises and machinery in and with which Pakenham carried on his business, and that the partnership was arranged and the three other persons brought in, in order to secure advances on a line of credit from the Standard Bank to enable the business to be carried until such time as it was expected that the limited company would be in a position to take it over.\nThe arrangement was brought about by the joint efforts of Pakenham and Morden, who was then manager of the bank and one of the provisional directors of the limited company. The partners other than Pakenham were really only partners as to profits and losses. The partnership assets would be the stock in trade, book debts, moneys and other property derived or acquired in the prosecution of the business. The partnership liabilities would consist of all debts or obligations incurred during the continuance of the term of partnership. The partnership capital was the line of credit in the Standard Bank.\nThe business was being carried on in this way at the date of the shareholders\u2019 meeting. At that meeting the shareholders approved of, adopted, ratified and confirmed the agreement of the 4th of May, 1901, and ordered that an agreement be executed to give effect thereto. By-laws were adopted and the defendants Pakenham and Byer were elected directors along with H.J. Morden, W.C. Renfrew and N. Clarke. Pakenham was appointed managing director with a salary of $2,500 per annum, and a percentage of profits for five years.\nThe first meeting of the directors was held on the 7th of April, at which all the directors except Kendrick were present. Pakenham was elected President; Renfrew, Vice-President, and A. Low, Secretary. The next meeting of importance was held on the 30th of May, the same four directors being present. Among other business transacted a resolution was passed directing the Secretary to put the company\u2019s seal on Pakenham\u2019s agreement.\nThese steps were probably taken in view of the near approach of the expiration of the term of the partnership which occurred on the 2nd of June.\nBut when that time arrived the limited company was not in a position to take over the business. And at a meeting of the directors held on the 4th of June, at which Pakenham, Byer, Morden and Renfrew were present, a resolution was passed \u201cthat in consideration of the Pakenham Pork Packing Company, comprising Messrs. Byer, Kendrick, Pakenham and Mrs. Forsythe, continuing and carrying on the present partnership business until such time as the business can be taken over by the Pakenham Pork Packing Company, Limited, that the said Pakenham Pork Packing Company, Limited, do indemnify and save harmless the said Pakenham Pork Packing Company from all loss occasioned by the continuation of said business by said partnership company.\u201d\nKendrick and Mrs. Forsythe did not assent to the terms of this resolution. On the contrary they both took the ground that they would not continue longer in the partnership, and of this Pakenham and Byer were made aware, as was also Morden.\nPakenham prepared a statement of the affairs of the partnership and submitted it to Kendrick and Mrs. Forsythe, from which it appeared that the assets amounted to $34,490, while the debt due to the Standard Bank amounted to $33,600, leaving a surplus of $890.\nThis was on the 6th of June, and on the same day Mrs. Forsythe wrote letters in the same terms to Pakenham and Morden. That addressed to Pakenham was submitted to the Board of Directors on the 10th of June, and on motion of Morden, seconded by Byer, it was resolved that Pakenham write to Mrs. Forsythe and ask her to meet Byer and Kendrick in reference to her letter. There was a meeting, with the result that Mrs. Forsythe and Kendrick adhered to their resolution not to continue longer in the business.\nAt the trial it was shewn that the letter to Pakenham was lost, but that addressed to Morden was proved. It stated that after consideration of the statement of affairs of the partnership she had decided to withdraw therefrom, and that she would not be responsible for any further advance or liability in any way, and that from the statement furnished by the partnership their affairs appeared to be in a prosperous condition, and she, therefore, expected a cheque for $222.50 and a release signed by all the members of the partnership from further liability. She repeated that she would not be responsible for any further advances, and concluded, \u201cfrom the statement you furnished me the company\u2019s affairs appear to be in a prosperous condition, and no doubt you will be able to get Mr. Renfrew or some other stockholder in the new company to take the position in the present company which I now vacate.\u201d\nThus the limited company as well as the Standard Bank, through the manager, Morden, had full notice of Mrs. Forsythe\u2019s position, and neither she nor Kendrick ever receded from their position in this respect.\nAt a directors\u2019 meeting in November, 1902, there were present Pakenham, Byer, Renfrew and Morden. On motion of Renfrew, seconded by Morden, it was resolved, that the limited company now take over from the partnership, the plant and premises in accordance with the agreement made, the limited company to take from the partnership an assignment of all book debts, choses in action and rights of the partnership in connection with the business of the limited company; also to take and receive from the partnership all the stock in the factory and in transit, also to receive an assignment of the existing lease of the present premises\u2014the limited company to indemnify the partnership against all its outstanding debts in connection with the business, according to a list to be furnished and attached to and form part of the agreement embodying the arrangement as hereinbefore set out, and the agreement with list of debts attached to be submitted to the directors for approval before being finally executed.\nThe transfer was subsequently effected and the company paid over the sum of $30,094.63 to the partnership. It was proved at the trial that the assets so transferred were worth only $12,000.\nThe court of appeal held that the respondents Kendrick and Forsythe were not liable for this amount. The liquidator appealed.\nW.M. Douglas K.C. and S.B. Woods for the appellant.\nShepley K.C. for the respondent Forsythe.\nJohn W. McCullough for the respondent Kendrick.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and GIROUARD J. were of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing, so far as the two respondents herein are concerned, a judgment of Street J. whereby an agreement made between a partnership company of which the respondents were two of the members and an incorporated company of which the appellant is liquidator was set aside and all the members of the partnership, including respondents, held liable for $18,363.66, the difference between $30,736.65, the amount paid out of the funds of the incorporated company for certain property and assets of the partnership, and $12,372.99, the admitted full value of such assets.\nSo far as Kendrick and Forsythe, two members of the partnership, are concerned they were held by the judgment appealed from not to be liable for this sum of $18,363.66, while their two associate partners, Pakenham and Byer, were held liable and the judgment of the trial judge so far as the latter were concerned confirmed.\nThese two, Pakenham and Byer, filled the dual positions of members of the partnership which sold its assets to the company, and directors of the company which bought those assets and paid the money for them. The court of appeal understood \u201cthat the trial judge did not set aside the transaction of the bargain and sale, but permitted it to stand and reduced the amount of the consideration to what he found to be the value taken by the limited company,\u201d and while holding this to be the appropriate form of relief as against Pakenham and Byer, the Appeal Court held it was not as against the other two, Kendrick and Forsythe.\nThe Chief Justice delivering the judgment of the court says:\nThey were not directors of the company, they received no part of the moneys paid or deposited on the 31st October and they were guilty of no act which can render them personally responsible to the Limited Company in respect of the two items in question. It is true that Kendrick and Forsythe were not directors of the company and were not personally guilty of any improper or fraudulent act towards the company. But I am quite unable to accept the conclusion of the Chief Justice that\nthey received no part of the moneys paid or deposited on the 31st October ($30,094.6.3)\nor that they were not responsible for the acts and representations of their co-partners who were also directors of the company.\nThis money was not actually paid into their own hands it is true, but it was taken by their partner Pakenham from the funds of the limited company of which he was president and manager, and paid into the bank to discharge and pay the $30,094.63 which, on that day, 31st October, the partnership of which they were members owed the bank and which, of course, they were personally liable for. The judgment appealed from relieves these respondents from their unquestioned liability on the 31st October for the amount of the debts of this partnership which exceeded the assets by $18,000, and it could only be sustained by holding the appropriation of the limited company\u2019s moneys to have been legally defensible, and such as a court of equity could sanction. Nor do I understand the judgment of the trial judge as understood by the court of appeal. His formal judgment does not in so many words rescind the agreement dated in November, 1902, and executed in January, 1903, for the bargain and sale of the partnership assets to the limited company. But the result of the judgment substantially is to do so, and in his reasons for judgment it is quite plain that what he intended to do was to rescind this agreement. After referring to the agreement he goes on to say: Of course that was an absurd, outrageously absurd, agreement to make on behalf of the partnership. The assets\u2014what are called assets\u2014as distinct from the plant and buildings, belonged to the partnership. The plant, buildings, etc., belonged to Mr. Pakenham himself, so that is an easy way of separating them. And because of the absurd nature of the agreement, it is a matter that cannot possibly stand, where the managing portion of the buyers, the incorporated company, were the principal partners in the partnership. So that an account should be taken there of the moneys paid by the Limited Company in debts of the partnership in the shape of book debts and stock in trade, and the partnership should pay the difference between these two sums, and they should not have got it.\nI fully concur in the conclusions of the trial judge as to \u201cthe absurd, outrageously absurd\u201d character of this agreement. It does not seem to me to be so much an improvident or a questionable agreement as one utterly indefensible and unjust, if not actually fraudulent. It was not an agreement dealing with a speculative property or with property about which one might charitably imagine large differences of opinion could honestly exist, but one dealing with property and assets about the real value of which, if there had been no misrepresentations or concealment of material facts, there could not exist any substantial difference. In determining such value the trial judge with consent of counsel accepted the nominal or face value of the debts as given though it is well known they were not of such face value, and the value of the other assets as claimed by the defendants in the action. The counsel for the liquidator chose to accept this rather than go to a reference, and the difference between such value and the amount actually paid for these assets, viz., $30,094.63, was $18,000, the sum now in dispute and which the partnership benefited by and the limited company lost.\nBy such consent and such action of the court with respect to it the respondents are effectually answered when they suggest that rescission could not take place because they could not be restored to their former position. As a matter of fact they were placed by the judgment of the court in a much better position than they possibly could have been in if the stock and book debts were handed back to them, for they were allowed more than their highest value.\nThe court of appeal agree that the transaction is one which so far as Pakenham and Byer, the two partners who were also directors of the limited company, are concerned, cannot stand, and the whole question is whether it can stand as regards the other two members of the partnership, Kendrick and Forsythe, the now respondents, because they were not directors of the company or active participants in the transaction impeached.\nThe contention is that the agreement has not and ought not to be set aside, but that so far as Pakenham and Byer are concerned they must not, being alike vendors and purchasers, benefit from the transaction, but must be held liable for the $18,000 improperly taken from the limited company while their partners for whom they acted and who, as a consequence of their action, are benefited to the extent of the $18,000 cannot be held liable for it.\nI am not able to accept such reasoning. The agreement made by Pakenham and Byer, directors of the company, with themselves as members of the partnership is not and cannot be defended.\nIt could only have been accepted by a disinterested director under misrepresentation or concealment of the facts, and it is plain to me that such was the case with respect to the director Clark. It does appear to me that if from the nature of their dual positions these two men, Pakenham and Byer, could not be permitted to benefit at the expense of the company and its share- holders from such an agreement as they attempted to make between the partnership and the company, neither should their co-partners for whom they acted be permitted so to benefit.\nIf because of misrepresentation of material facts or failure to disclose them or the outrageous character of the bargain or the dual character of their positions or all or any of these things combined the benefits which Pakenham and Byer would have derived as members of the partnership if the agreement was maintained is denied them, surely it must on the same grounds and for the same reasons be denied to those partners of theirs for whom they acted. I cannot understand how these other two partners, the respondents Kendrick and Forsythe, can be permitted to escape liability for a sum of $18,000 while their partners, who consummated and carried out the transaction by which the escape is effected, are held liable for the same sum on the ground that under the circumstances the principles of equity will not permit them to reap and enjoy such unrighteous profits and advantages. The reasoning of the court proceeds, of course, on the ground that the agreement was not and could not be set aside, and that only the active participants in the wrong should be punished, but it omits the vital and cardinal facts that the active partners were the agents of the silent partners throughout the transaction, and that the result of the judgment would be to permit the latter to enjoy the fruits of an unrighteous contract made for them by their active agents and partners.\nPakenham was the one ruling active managing partner in the partnership, and also the ruling active managing director of the limited company. In this dual capacity he sold or attempted to sell the assets of the partnership to the limited company at a time when their extreme value was $12,000 for a price so outrageous and absurd ($30,000) that so far as he is concerned it is agreed on all sides and by all the courts it must be set aside and he be held liable for the unjust and improper benefits or profits he attempted to obtain. And so also with regard to Byer. But it is said that because Kendrick and Forsythe were not active participants in the wrong done to the shareholders of the company they are entitled to enjoy the fruits of such wrongful action which they equally shared with Pakenham.\nStripped of all irrelevant matter the facts become plain and simple. Without authority or justification Pakenham on the 31st of October took $30,094.63 of the money belonging to the shareholders of the limited company and paid it to the bank to extinguish the partnership company\u2019s debt.\nIt is contended that in the following month of November the transaction was ratified at a meeting of the directors of the company, four of them being present and two of the four being Pakenham and Byer, and the assets of the partnership agreed to be accepted as consideration for the money paid.\nIt is quite plain that these two latter were not disinterested or competent directors to bind the company to such a transaction, and it is equally plain that the resolution of the directors at such meeting was not an authority to carry out the transaction, or even a confirmation of it, because it expressly provided that a most important part of the transaction was to be determined upon at a further and subsequent director\u2019s meeting.\nSuch other meeting was, it is contended, held on Jan. 21st, 1903, at which five directors, Pakenham, Byer, Clark, Morden and Renfrew were present, when it was resolved, Renfrew dissenting, that the agreement in question \u201cshould be approved and executed by the different parties.\u201d\nBut Clark, one of the directors, states explicitly, that he voted to approve because he thought he could not help himself being misled by the assurances given him by Pakenham and his solicitor that the limited company was bound to carry the agreement out in furtherance of a previous resolution which the directors had come to in the preceding month of June. It is clear beyond argument that the previous resolution referred to in no sense bound the company or the directors to any such approval or ratification, and that Clark\u2019s vote and adhesion were obtained by a clear misrepresentation of the facts.\nThen, again, it is equally clear that if Pakenham did not deliberately misrepresent the material facts which the directors ought to have known he failed to disclose those facts to them.\nThe mischief, however, had at that time been done, the misappropriation of the funds had already taken place, and if the parties to it then desired to obtain the ratification of the company either at a meeting of the directors or of the shareholders of the company, such ratification could only be obtained on a full and plain statement of the true facts being laid before them.\nNo ratification by the shareholders ever took place. The matter was never laid before them, and the resolution of the directors relied upon as sufficient was passed, not with the facts truly laid before them, but under clear misapprehension and suppression of those facts, if not specific misrepresentation.\nSuch a resolution so obtained could not operate to bind the shareholders or the limited company to any transaction so inequitable, unjust and outrageous as the one now in question, and to me it is inconceivable that any disinterested director with the true knowledge of the facts would have voted such ratification. Renfrew dissented. Pakenham and Byer from their fiduciary relationship to the partnership and the company were disqualified. Clark was misled, and the only remaining director was Morden, the manager of the bank which had advanced the money and to which it was owing.\nIt must be remembered that while Kendrick and Forsythe had at the expiration of the partnership articles given the clearest notice that they would not be bound for further advances made to the partnership and that they desired to terminate it and put an end to it, they still remained liable for the then existing debts of the partnership of which this $30,094.63 formed part. No notice or determination on their part could avail to relieve them of such liability. The partnership remained in liquidation during the summer and autumn months, and on the 31st of October when the moneys of the limited company were applied by Pakenham in paying off this partnership debt to the bank the liability of the partners existed.\nSuch appropriation as I have already shewn was quite illegal and improper. It was not, in my opinion, at any time subsequently approved of or legally ratified by the company either in meeting of the directors or shareholders, and that being so I am at a loss to conceive on what principles Kendrick and Forsythe can be held to be released from their liability for this partnership debt or that liability fastened upon the limited company. All parties agree that it was not until the 1st November, 1902, that the incorporated com- pany took over the property. Up to that time at least the partnership was in liquidation.\nSome observations of the Chief Justice of the court of appeal were called to our attention as implying a doubt in his mind whether the rule in Clayton\u2019s Case[1] could not be invoked to relieve the partners from their liability for the debt to the bank. But it seems to me quite clear that as between the parties to this suit, the shareholders of the limited company acting through the liquidator and the partners of the partnership company, no such rule could have any application. No juggling with figures on the part of the bank and no method of keeping their accounts adopted by them could possibly affect the liabilities, as between themselves, of the parties to this suit. The point was mentioned by counsel, but not pressed or elaborated, and was practically disposed of at the argument, it appearing to be clear from the record that at the trial the liability of the several partners to the bank for the $30,094.63 paid with the money of the limited company was admitted.\nThe last and remaining contention of Mr. Shepley was that rescission could not be granted in this case, because the parties could not be restored to their original position. There was no dispute as to the general proposition, but its application to the facts of this case was denied, and I have already partially dealt with it. The full value of the assets of the partnership at the date when the $30,094.63 was paid over was allowed to the respondents. They were not prejudiced nor placed in a different position with regard to these assets. Their value was agreed to at the trial and the partnership was allowed full credit for them. The respondents, therefore, are not in a posi- tion to invoke the application of the principle referred to.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court of appeal, and the judgment of the trial court restored.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The defendants, Pakenham, Byer, Kendrick and Mrs. Forsythe, were partners in a pork packing business.\nThe Pakenham Pork Packing Company was a joint stock company incorporated under the Ontario Joint Stock Companies Act and organized in April, 1902.\nThe partnership was heavily indebted to the Standard Bank and relieved themselves by improperly using, in May, 1902, seven thousand dollars of the corporate company\u2019s money.\nThis was done by the simple process of drawing a cheque signed by the hand of Mr. Pakenham upon the corporate company\u2019s bank account, and placing it to the credit of the partnership account.\nOn the 31st October, 1902, the process was repeated, but this time the cheque was for $30,094.63, and was signed by the same Mr. Pakenham\u2019s hand in the name of \u201cPakenham Pork Packing Company, Limited,\u201d per \u201cJas. Pakenham, managing director.\u201d\nIn neither case was there any transaction between the partnership and the company that lent any colour of right to such a proceeding. There was nothing but audacity,\u2014or should I say kind philanthropy to aid a hard pressed concern\u2014to justify such an action.\nThe company went into liquidation and the plaintiff, as liquidator, sued to recover from the partners these moneys.\nMr. Justice Street, who tried the case, gave judgment for the plaintiff, for both sums less a sum of $12,372, that the parties at the trial agreed had come to the hands of the company, from the goods of the partners, by a later proceeding to which I will refer presently.\nThe Court of Appeal held he was right in respect of $7,000, but wrong as to the second sum as regards the respondents Kendrick and Mrs. Forsythe.\nThis is an appeal by the liquidator from such judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nIt seems that the right of action as to both sums was on the first of November, 1902, complete.\nI have abstained thus far from referring to aught else in the case in order that the matter may appear clearly in what I believe to be its true light. It was conceded by the counsel for respondent, Mrs. Forsythe, that there was no bargain by which these takings of the company\u2019s money could be justified, at least up to the 31st October, 1902, and possibly the 19th November, when there took place what, with steps following it, he relied upon.\nCounsel for Kendrick took the position that, on the 4th of June, 1902, at a meeting of four directors of the company of whom defendants, Pakenham and Byer, were two, a resolution was passed that the company, in consideration of the partners named continuing and carrying on the partnership business until such time as the business could be taken over by the company, the company indemnified and saved harmless the partnership from all loss occasioned by such continuation.\nThis curious resolution passed at such a meeting of directors composed of two of the men thus indemnified, and only two other directors, when the business of the Board could only be conducted by a quorum of three, needs only these facts to be stated to shew how little in law it is worth considering here. No agreement followed it then, or was founded upon it.\nThe beneficent document was not considerate enough even to promise that the company should get the benefit of the profits, if any, earned by the carrying on of the business.\nThe company had no more to do with that partnership business than with any other, had never promised to buy it or become bound in any way in regard to it. Proximity and a common parentage were all that lent a colour to the confused notions of the business relations of the partnership and company.\nThe partners, however, on the 31st of October, 1902, got from the bank their securities which they had given for the partnership debt, and this, undoubtedly, as the result of Mr. Pakenham giving, as already stated, on that date the cheque of the company for $30,094.63.\nIt was faintly suggested in argument that this man Pakenham was the managing director of the company and hence his co-partners could deal with him in making a bargain such as implied by this transaction.\nBut there was no bargain nor any pretence of bargain till 19th November following. He had no authority from the company to do what he did on the 31st October, 1902. He had authority from the respondents, as their partner, though in liquidation only, and their adoption of his acts by accepting the results completed a confirmation thereof, if it were needed. The reliance placed upon the later acts of the company\u2019s officers as binding, indeed, the only alleged binding thing relied on, presupposes want of authority in Pakenham on 31st October. Yet the respondents held, in the meantime, their surrendered securities, and I repeat thereby confirmed if needed be the authority of Pakenham to get for, and bring to them, such valuable documents.\nBoth respondents rely upon what took place on 19th November, 1902, and at later meetings, when an agreement professing to be an assignment pursuant to a bargain of the previous July, used in its operative part the words\nof the partnership business now being operated by the company as a going concern, together with all the stock in trade in and upon the said premises or in any way the property of the said parties of the first part in connection with the said business, and doth also assign, transfer and set over unto the said parties of the second part all the book debts, claims, demands and choses in action of them and the said parties of the first part arising out of or in connection with the said business carried on under the name of the Pakenham Pork Packing Company other than and except any rights as against the parties of the second part, and the intention and agreement being that the said parties of the second part shall in all respects occupy the position of the parties of the first part in respect of the said business so carried on.\nIt proceeded to bind the company to pay all the debts according to schedule \u201cA\u201d attached.\nNo one seemed able to specify these debts and the matter stood over till January, 1903.\nThe learned trial judge properly, as I think, characterized this as an absurd, outrageously absurd, agreement.\nI do not think it necessary to consider it further than to say that I fail to see in it anything that released or in any way abrogated the right of action that had enured to the company the moment their money was on the 31st October, 1902, wrongfully taken from them.\nThe agreement of July was so amended by consent at the trial as to take away any basis for resting this agreement upon that. It does not profess to be a ratification of what Pakenham had presumed to do on the 31st October.\nIt was sanctioned only by Pakenham, Byer and Clark, of the directorate. The meeting of directors consisted of only four directors. One of them opposed its adoption. Clark explains how he was improperly led by Pakenham to believe the company already bound by the July agreement which obviously they were not.\nIt required three directors to make a quorum.\nI am unable to understand how the action of Pakenham and Byer, sitting as directors and personally interested in the matter, could give vitality thus to what had been done by Pakenham on 31st October even if, though it does not profess to relate back thereto, it could, by intendment of law, be made so to relate back. In fact Pakenham had already presumed on 31st October to take over the stock in trade and all that this professes to assign.\nCould he do so? The whole board were by the by-law of the company only authorized\nto make or cause to be made for the company any description of contract which the company may by law enter into.\nThat certainly would not have rendered a contract made by all the directors for themselves with the company lawful, without the express sanction of the shareholders.\nNor do I think the resolution of January, 1903, brought about by imposing upon Clark, as he explains, or supported by Morden, under circumstances I need not enlarge upon, but which made him a person deeply interested in not discharging his duty as a director, remedies or rectifies the matter.\nI am unable to see how this case where the directors, or a majority of them, acting, were doing it for themselves, stands any higher that where they all may have done so, in such a supposed case.\nAnd when the result sought is to set up a bargain for 30,000 and for what it was admitted was then worth only about $12,372, one is not apt to infer, in law, any authority, in the minority of one or two disinterested directors to form for fellow interested directors a contract.\nIt is to be noted that the Ontario Joint Stock Companies Act as amended expressly forbids directors voting on sales by or to themselves, and emphasizes thus what possibly was law before in most cases one can conceive of. I think, however, it may well be held as going beyond the law as it stood before and render ipso facto void all contracts resting upon such voting so as to need no rescission.\nIn this view there is no need of setting aside this agreement. It is, however, as I hold, only necessary to find that it failed in law to set up or place on any legal basis the acts of 31st October, 1902, which cannot be supported.\nAnd as to the supposed difficulty of putting the parties respondent here in the same position as they were before that time, the only difficulty is that created by these respondents and their partners putting assets they had in the control of the officers of the company, and such mistake is easy of remedy by allowing the value of those assets, which was done by the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nThe disposal of their partnership goods was what respondents say they awaited, and hence less difficulty in this part of the case.\nThey have disposed of, at no doubt a good price, $12,372 worth of what they wanted to sell and dispose of.\nThe appeal should be allowed and judgment of trial judge restored with costs here and below.\nMACLENNAN J. concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: S.B. Woods.\nSolicitor for the respondent Kendrick: James McCullough.\nSolicitor for the respondent Forsythe: W.S. Ormiston.\n[1] 1 Mer. 572.\n",

Owing to a regatta there was an unusual amount of travel on the street cars that day and when the car containing plaintiff had proceeded a certain distance it was stopped and the passengers informed that it would not go farther in that direction. The plaintiff insisted on his right to be carried to his destination in that car, refused a transfer and hired a cab. He then brought an action against the Street Railway Co. for damages.\nThe trial judge and the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia sitting en banc held that there was no obligation on the company's part to carry him to his destination on that particular car, that it was his duty to inquire of the conductor and ascertain where such car was going and he could not recover. Newcombe K.C. and W. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellant.\nMellish K.C. and Lovett (Murray with them) for the respondents.\nThe appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed, Idington J. dissenting, and the following judgments were delivered.\nDAVIES J.\u2014For the reasons given by Townshend and Graham JJ. in the court below I think this appeal should be dismissed.\nI merely wish to guard myself against being committed to the opinion that all the rules applicable to the carriage of passengers on ordinary railway trains are applicable to passengers carried on city electric cars, or that the American cases cited in the elaborate opinion of Graham J. on this point are necessarily applicable to the facts of this case.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The name of the respondents indicates their business. It is carried on in Halifax.\nThe appellant, accompanied by his wife and a friend, desiring to return home, some considerable distance from where they found themselves, saw on that part of the respondents' track which was beside them, and formed part of a belt line, two cars standing to receive passengers. The front car had inscribed on front and in rear thereof the words \"Quinpool Road.\" The rear car attached thereto was a trailer. The appellant was a resident of the city, and knew that cars so marked were accustomed to carry passengers by a continuous journey along the company's track, on what was known as the belt line of the system.\nAppellant's home was within a short distance of this belt line and was passed by the cars marked \"Quinpool Road.\" The appellant with his wife and friend got into this trailer. They were drawn for a mile and a quarter along this belt line in the direction they expected to go, but away further from their home and from Quinpool Road than when they started, and then turned out, as the company desired the cars to return to the point these cars and people had started from.\nThe appellant had bought tickets for himself and party, and on each of these tickets were the words \"Halifax Electric Tramway Company, Limited, F. A. Huntress, manager.\"\nIt is admitted these tickets entitled him to ride all round the belt line in question. Obviously the whole contract\u2014and it is admitted there was a contract\u2014 was not contained in the words written on the ticket or formed by the purchase of a ticket. Some tickets conferred one, and others another right when used. That right depended on facts outside the ticket.\nThen where do we find the necessary evidence beyond the ticket to shew the contract?\nThe obvious answer is, in the invitation by the company to ride and the acceptance thereof by the passengers.\nHow is the invitation extended? It is universally found to exist, in street railway traffic, in the shape of some word or words or sign to indicate the destination or the particular part of the line a car is proposed to be run over. This abbreviated or sign language is highly useful, is well understood by the masses of the people desiring to travel by such cars, and facilitates the use of such means of transportation.\nIts adoption and long continued use by the respondents and recognition by the appellant and others gives to the interpretation of it, when acted upon by any one possessed of a ticket, as binding and definite a contract as can possibly be framed.\nThe interpretation of the words \"Quinpool Road\" are not in the slightest doubt in this case. It was as plain in its meaning, to those daily accustomed to its use, as if a long contract had been written out signifying that the car on which it was inscribed was intended to run, and should run, along the belt line, from the starting point at which a passenger entered it, till it returned there, and to pass Quinpool Road in its journey.\nIt never was intended to mean anything else than that.\nIts use by the company on a car, not intended to go round the belt, not intended to get a foot nearer Quinpool Road than where it started from, should have been guarded against.\nThey seek to excuse themselves by saying that there was by reason of a regatta attracting a large crowd more than usual travel. They therefore used this \"Quinpool Road\" car to help to handle the crowd by taking them by means of these cars to the distributing point a mile and a quarter from where the appellant got on board.\nIt became the duty of the respondents in such a case before using this car purely for such local purpose to have taken down their sign.\nIf immovable, the price of a ticket, spent in buying a strip of cotton, and a few cents more in writing thereon the direction and distance of the car's intended run, for that day. would have served, when properly used, to keep off the car gentlemen like appellant, who had no desire to expose himself and wife to the pelting rain then falling.\nOf course its use might also have lessened the receipts. I assume it was not for a fraudulent purpose, but through pure neglect this trouble was not taken.\nThe idle pretext, that the company set up, of appellant's knowledge that such uses had been made by the company of such cars on former occasions when the crowd to be carried was great, should not, on this evidence, avail anything. There is no evidence to support it.\nEvidently the appellant had not the slightest suspicion that such was to be the course on this occasion or he would not have set foot in the car. What could he gain? To get on a car to be dumped off it, and wait where so dumped off till the right car caught up, instead of getting on a right one at the start seems unlikely to have been done intentionally.\nAppellant swears he was about to take a cab when his wife saw and pointed out this \"Quinpool Road\" car, and on her proper and natural suggestion they entered.\nIt does not seem to me to be possible to attribute to the appellant any negligence or any improper motive. He was a man of such intelligence in the midst of such surroundings, as to forbid us assuming either to have been the cause of the mishap.\nSo plain, so palpable, a neglect of duty, on the part of the respondent company, and so liable to mislead, was met only by offering a transfer to another belt line car leaving the parties to stand in the rain until one came.\nThe contract was broken when the appellant was turned out of the car.\nIf the appellant had not been misled and had known that he had to face the inconvenience in question he, presumably, never would have taken a seat in the car. He was probably better off waiting for one that really was a belt line or Quinpool Road car at the starting place than where he was left, further from Quinpool Road than when he had started.\nIt seems, in all the discussion relating to a transfer, to be forgotten that in the ordinary course of things, there were no transfers for such a service as going round the belt, and that it was because appellant did not want to be troubled with transferring in such weather, that he took a \"Quinpool Road\" car, on the invitation of the company, as security against any need for a transfer.\nI do not in this view need to follow the matter further. In regard, however, to the allegation of the company that trailers are not used with Quinpool Road cars it is met by the oath of the plaintiff that he had seen them and it is only partially denied, and it was much more reasonable to expect that for an occasion needing extra effort it would be put in use by a trailer attached to a Quinpool Road car serving for the whole length of the belt line than that so misleading a sign would be kept up only to run a fourth of the distance and never come within miles of the Quinpool Road district.\nThe trailer moves where the motor car goes and not elsewhere. The appellant is just as much entitled to bring his action as if he had seated himself in the motor car. If the financial condition of the respondents is so distressing that they cannot keep a sufficient supply of properly marked cars to meet the exigencies of a crowded day just as well as poor people keep rain coats for the exceptional day, they are much to be pitied. We cannot, however, allow such natural sympathy as poverty evokes to interpret this contract.\nThe contention that any intending passenger, seeking a car marked with a sign that means, according to the usual language of the locality and the ordinary custom of the road, that it is running to or past a well-known point, is negligent, unless he ask some conductor or other authority, is a proposition that is not, I think, maintainable in law, and I venture, with great respect, to say not in accord with the average sense of those of the reasonably intelligent people who are expected to be guided by the sign.\nThe safety of the travelling public requires that the conductor of these cars be assisted, as much as possible, by an intelligent use of those signs, by all intending passengers, so that he be not too much distracted, by such inquiries, from his other duties.\nI think the appeal ought to be allowed with costs and the judgments below set aside and judgment entered for the plaintiff for f 1 with full costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H. C. Borden.\nSolicitor for the respondent: R. H. Murray.\n[1] 38 N.S. Rep. 212.\n",

B.'s order was sent to and accepted by the company and the goods delivered to a carrier in Glasgow to be forwarded to B. in Nova Scotia.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (37 N.S.R. 482) Idington J. dissenting, that the contract was made and completed in Glasgow.\nWhere a contract was made and completed in Glasgow, Scotland, for the sale of liquor by parties there to a trader in a county in Nova Scotia where liquor was forbidden by law to be sold on pain of fine or imprisonment and the vendors had no actual knowledge that the purchaser intended to re-sell the liquors illegally, the contract was not void and the vendors could recover the price of the goods.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment at the trial by which the plaintiffs' action was maintained with costs.\nThe plaintiffs carried on business at Glasgow, in Scotland, as distillers, and appointed sales agents at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, with authority restricted to receiving and transmitting orders, the acceptance of such orders being in the discretion of the plaintiffs' officers in Glasgow. The defendant carried on a trade in liquors in Nova Scotia without the license provided by the \"Liquor License Act,\" R.S.N.S. 1900, ch. 100, and had a place of business at Truro, in the County of Colchester, where the \"Canada Temperance Act\" was in force. The defendant placed orders for whisky by written memoranda with the plaintiffs' agents at Halifax, and his orders were transmitted in the regular course of business to the plaintiffs in Glasgow. The plaintiffs accepted the orders and shipped the whisky from Glasgow to the defendant at Truro, N.S., and, after he had received the goods, passed drafts upon him for the price with freight added, which were accepted by the defendant upon presentation, but were dishonoured at maturity. The plaintiffs brought the action on the drafts for the price of the liquors sold and the defendant pleaded that the contract was void, having been made in Nova Scotia with the object of enabling him to re-sell the liquors there in contravention of the statutes prohibiting such sales under penalty of fine and imprisonment.\nThe judgment appealed from affirmed the decision of the judge at the trial maintaining the action and holding that the contract was completed only at Glasgow, upon the acceptance of the orders and delivery of the goods to the carrier, and that there was no evidence to shew that the plaintiffs had any knowledge of the intention of the defendant to re-sell the liquors contrary to law.\nLovett for the appellant. The contract was made at Halifax, N.S., where the agents received appellants' orders and, after communicating with the respondents, notified the appellant of the acceptance of the orders on the part of the respondents. See Leake on Contracts (4 ed.) pp. 18, 19, 20, 25. At any rate, the order was never accepted by the respondents except at Truro, N.S., where the goods were delivered. Taylor v. J ones[2].\nThe contract comes within the Statute of Frauds, and the place of contract is the place where the written agreement or memorandum was signed, or where there is a delivery and acceptance. Coombs v. Bristol and Exeter Ry. Co.[3]; Aris v. Orchard[4]; Alderton v. Archer[5]. The written memorandum was signed by the appellant in Nova Scotia; the receipt and acceptance of the goods took place at Truro, likewise the acceptance of the drafts with bills of lading attached. The acceptance of the order, if any, was given and despatched, by the agents of the respondents from Halifax.\nThe word \"sell\" in section 86, chapter 100, R.S.N.S., 1900, should be given its ordinary and popular meaning; and, if any part of the transaction took place in Nova Scotia, the transaction is within that statute. The provision is pointed not only at the contract but at the performance of the contract, including all negotiations leading up to the final delivery of the property purchased. The court should not strain it in order to enforce any other view as to the place where part of the agreement was carried out, if the contract violates the policy of its forum. Hope v. Hope[6], per Turner L.J. See also Rousillon v. Rousillon[7]; Kaufman v. Gerson[8]; Green v. Van Bukirk[9].\nThe authority to the agent was by its express terms, an authority to sell, and the only limitation (if any) ever placed on that authority, was an understanding that the agents should submit orders to their principal and have the principal's approval before accepting the orders. The evidence does not warrant even this restriction, but, even if granted, it does not affect the sale initiated between the purchaser and the agents, and closed eventually by a communication from the agents to the purchaser.\nThe payment of freight at Glasgow is of no consequence as regards the place of the contract: Fragano v. Long[10], per Holroyd J.; Danlop v. Lambert[11], per Cottenham L.C.; Ross v. Morrison[12]; Werle & Co. v. Colquhoun[13]. The acceptance of an offer must be communicated to the offerer or some one authorized by him to receive acceptance; Benjamin on Sales (1891) p. 43; Emerson v. Graff[14]; and where an acceptance is transmitted through an agent the place from which the agent despatches such acceptance is the place of contract; Ivey v. Kern County Land Co.[15]. A carrier is not an agent to accept goods in sales covered by the Statute of Frauds; Hanson v. Armitage[16]; Norman v. Phillips[17]; Meredith v. Meigh[18]; and where goods are to be shipped by water and vendor does not insure or notify vendee so that he has an opportunity to insure goods they remain at risk of vendor; Chalmers (1902), p. 72; Bell's Law of Sales, p. 89.\nThe contract is invalid if contrary to the laws of the place where it is to be performed; Minor, Conflict of Laws, 401-2 and 418; Westlake, p. 258, sec. 212. Such a sale made in Nova Scotia is invalid as being in contravention of penal statutes prohibiting the re-sale of the whisky; Brown v. Moore[19]. If there was knowledge in the agents or circumstances which fairly put them on inquiry, the principal is affected with that knowledge. They were, by the express terms of the appointment, the sole agents of the principals in respect to the sale of their liquors in Nova Scotia. The orders for such liquors were obtained by these agents and accepted by them and knowledge acquired by them in the course of such duties is the knowledge of their principals; Ross v. Morrison[20]; Suit v. Woodhall[21]; Backman v. Wright[22].\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondents. The evidence proves a contract of sale made in Scotland. The agency did not extend beyond the receiving and transmitting of such orders as might be handed to the agents by persons wishing to purchase goods from the plaintiffs, and no other act was performed. Delivery of the goods was made by the respondents directly to the appellant at Glasgow, and bills drawn upon appellant for the freight as well as the price of the goods. This was the usual course of business between the parties; Grainger & Son v. Gough[23]. Until the principal received the orders and accepted or agreed to accept there was no contract; Finch v. Mansfield[24].\nEven persons intimate with defendant's business might not know that he was conducting it illegally, by reason of the fact that he was a wholesaler and conducting a licensed liquor business in Halifax; that he had a perfect right to warehouse his goods in Truro and even to deliver to customers there if sales were made in Halifax; Pletts v. Beattie[25]; and that he also had a right to sell from Truro for delivery in any county in Nova Scotia or the adjoining provinces where there was no prohibitory law in force. Illegality is not to be presumed and there is evidence that defendant carried on his business throughout the Maritime Provinces. Giving the fullest possible effect to the evidence of defendant, it does not shew knowledge on the part of plaintiffs of the existence of the laws in force in Nova Scotia restricting the sale of intoxicating liquors or that the appellant was buying goods for the purpose of re-selling in violation of any law. As the sales were made in Scotland, the respondents were under no obligation to consider whether or not the appellant intended to re-sell the goods in Nova Scotia with or without a license, and, at all events, the sales were not illegal unless made with the intent on the vendor's part that the property, when sold, was to be applied to an illegal purpose; Pellecat v. Angell[26]; Clark v. Hagar[27]; Finch v. Mansfield (1); Stephenson v. W. J. Rogers, Limited[28]. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. Mere knowledge by the respondents, in Glasgow, if they had any, that the appellants might, perhaps, intend to re-sell this liquor in defiance of the law of Nova Scotia, is no bar to this action, and the finding by the two courts below that this sale took place in Glasgow is unimpeachable.\nA case of Magann v. Auger[29] in this court, in addition to those cited at bar, may be referred to on this point.\nGIROUARD J. concurred in the judgment of the majority of the court.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed and the judgment below affirming that of the trial judge confirmed.\nThe action was brought to recover the amount of certain bills of exchange drawn by the respondents upon the appellant and accepted by him for the purchase price of certain whisky ordered and received by him from the respondents.\nThe respondents are Glasgow merchants carrying on business there in the spirits and wine trade. The defendant is a trader carrying on business in Truro, Nova Scotia.\nThe respondents had agents in Halifax, N.S., whose duties were to receive orders for goods and forward them on to the respondents at Glasgow by whom they were either accepted or refused.\nThe orders in question in this case were given by the appellant to these agents verbally and were by them transmitted to the respondents who accepted them and shipped the goods as ordered to the appellant in Truro, Nova Scotia, by whom they were afterwards received and used.\nThe freight and charges upon the goods were included with the price of them in a draft drawn upon appellant, accepted by him and returned by him to respondents in Glasgow.\nNo questions are raised as to the quality or condition of the goods or as to the acceptance of the draft in the usual course of business by the respondents.\nThe learned trial judge held that under the contract as proved the delivery of the goods to the carrier in Glasgow was a completion of the contract and that the property in them passed on such delivery to the appellant and gave judgment accordingly.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirmed that finding and judgment.\nOn appeal here it was contended that the contract was not complete until there was an acceptance of the goods by the defendant in Truro and that, under the Statute of Frauds, there was no binding contract until after such acceptance, which having taken place in Nova Scotia the contract must be held as having been made there, and being a sale there of alcoholic spirits in violation of the laws in force in that province was void.\nI have no difficulty whatever under the facts in holding that the judgments of the courts below were correct.\nThe Statute of Frauds is invoked, but as there was both an acceptance of the goods and a signature of the purchaser to the acceptance of the draft this statute was complied with.\nThe only question that was arguable, and it was put with great ingenuity by Mr. Lovett, was that that signature to the acceptance having been made and the goods accepted in Nova Scotia the contract must be held to have been made there.\nOn the argument I put this question to the learned counsel. Supposing the defendant had gone to Boston and had accepted the draft there, could it be held that the contract was made in Massachusetts, or, if the defendant had met the plaintiff on the high seas on board one of the transatlantic steamers and had given him f 1 as earnest money to bind the contract, would the contract have been held to have been made at sea and governed by the law of the nationality of the ship.\nAt common law there was undoubtedly, on the acceptance of the order and the shipping of the goods, a good binding contract and the property in the goods immediately passed to the grantee.\nThe mere fact that the requisites of the Statute of Frauds were complied with elsewhere than in Glasgow did not, in my opinion, operate to change the place where the contract was originally made.\nThe acceptance of the draft by the defendant and its transmission by him to the plaintiffs in Glasgow operated as a compliance with one of the requisites of the Statute of Frauds, but did not alter in any respect its terms or the liabilities of either of the parties under it. It merely enabled those liabilities to be enforced.\nI have read the different authorities cited by the appellant, but cannot find in any of them authority for the position that the mere fact of one of the requisites of the Statute of Frauds being complied with at a place other than that where the contract was made and completed, operated to change the place where that contract was made or defendant's liability under it according to the law of that place. The effect of the words in the 17th section of the Statute of Frauds, \"no contract,\" etc., \"shall be allowed to be good\" is not to make a contract void which does not comply with the provisions of the Statute of Frauds, but merely to render certain evidence indispensable when it is sought to enforce it.\nIn Maddison v. Alderson[30], at p. 488, Lord Blackburn says:\nI think it is now finallysettled that the true construction of the Statute of Frauds, both the 4th and the 17th sections, is not to render contracts within them void, still less illegal, but is to render the kind of evidence required indispensable when it is sought to enforce the contract.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The case of Grainger & Son v. Gough[31], so much relied upon in the courts below, and in argument here, does not, I think, touch the point to be decided here.\nThe point of that decision was that the foreign merchants could not be said to have, within the meaning of the Income Tax Act, carried on business in England though employing agents to solicit orders there.\nLord Herschell put that, at p. 336, thus:\nHow does a wine merchant exercise his trade? I take it, by making or buying wine and selling it again with a view to profit. If all that a merchant does in any particular country is to solicit orders I do not think he can reasonably be said to exercise or carry on his trade in that country.\nThese sentences point out clearly what the court there had to decide and did decide.\nThe questions to be considered there were entirely different from those raised here. Incidentally some of the questions here presented had to be looked upon there as part of a larger whole.\nBut the decision of the questions raised here either one way or the other could not have affected the decision there or the reasoning that led up to it.\nIn this case we have to determine whether or not the plaintiffs' claim rests, in any sense, upon a sale or delivery, by respondents, of liquor in Nova Scotia.\nIf the entire contract and its performance can be taken out of Nova Scotia then there cannot be said to have been in the contract any violation of the License Act of that province.\nThe business was done through an agent in Halifax, who had but limited authority.\nNo matter what the respondents set up now; clearly they thought when establishing the present agent in the Nova Scotia agency in question that he was an agent to sell. Their letter authorizing him expressly says:\nWe, therefore, hereby appoint you to act as our agents in the sale of our Gaelic and other brands of whisky for the whole of the Province of Nova Scotia on the same terms on which your father, Mr. Eagar, worked.\nIt is said there was a flat rate price from which the agent could not depart. But respondents might accept, reject or modify, and submit such modification for the customer's acceptance. Four months' credit seems to have been understood. I presume this was from verbal understanding.\nThere was no written order by letter, cable or in any way, from the appellant to the respondents. Orders both oral and written were given to the agent. None are produced. If any such had been directed to the respondents they would have been produced, no doubt, because the third difficulty the respondents had and have is want of compliance with the Statute of Frauds. The agent clearly was not the agent of the appellant, but of the respondents. When he got orders he cabled his principals, in such form as he saw fit, the substance of them.\nNeither agent nor customer signed the cables sent. The specimen letter from the agent, produced in evidence, is directed to the respondents, but signed by the agent as if he were a principal.\nIn no way do these communications bear out the suggestion of the Halifax agent being like a messenger or the post-office formally transmitting what had been entrusted merely for transmission. The agent was not the messenger or other agent of the appellant.\nThe transformation of the orders, the course of transmission and method of business must be borne in mind in seeking to understand the evidence of the respondents' witness, Holm, which is as follows:\nI say the contract for the sale of said goods was made by defendant, tendering the order to plaintiffs' agents for transmission by them (the agents) to the plaintiffs in Glasgow, and by the plaintiffs' acceptance in writing conveyed through their agents in Halifax. The goods were sold in Glasgow, Scotland.\nThis seems to imply clearly that this was the usual mode of dealing and the acceptance so notified might be either unconditional or with a modification from the usual terms and until such notification to the appellant there was no acceptance of the order and no contract.\nUpon notification according to this custom of the appellants, if the acceptance were unconditional they became bound and the contract was complete. Can it be said that a contract so arrived at was not formed in Nova Scotia?\nIt would seem too plain for argument that such was the result in that case. And as a result the contract would be void. The witness's swearing in effect to the law does not change the facts.\nThe next alternative presented is that the respondents did not forward any communication, but proceeded to ship the goods to Truro or Halifax, as indicated either by the order or the course of business-dealing between the parties.\nBut if the usual course of dealing was, as the respondents, by the evidence I quote, indicate it was, then they were shipped in the absence of a memo.\nsigned by the parties to be charged by such contract or their agents thereunto lawfully authorized\nsolely upon the chance of the appellant's acceptance of the goods on arrival.\nThey had, by the established course of business as sworn to, no authority from the appellant to rest upon in so shipping.\nThe appellant, in default of any acceptance notified to him (in the way and manner established between him and the respondents to carry on their business), closing the bargain could have rescinded his order. There was nothing to bind him. There could be no bargain, binding or otherwise, till the notification or the actual acceptance of the goods.\nThen such an acceptance ended in the completion as well as the beginning of a bargain in Nova Scotia, It was also the performance of the contract there.\nIn any way one looks at the matter, either as a contract or its performance, the result is in law fatal to the contract as the basis of an action.\nIt seems idle to suggest a bargain at common law, as was argued, whereby the Statute of Frauds would or might be excluded. It seems clearly settled law that\nthe receipt of goods by a carrier or wharfinger appointed by the purchaser does not constitute an acceptance, these agents having authority only to receive not to accept the goods for their employers.\nSee Benjamin on Sales, p. 153, and cases there cited.\nNorman v. Phillips[32], where the order was to send the goods to a specified station of the Great West-tern Railway to be forwarded to him as on previous occasions, seems to go much further than needed here, but in common with this includes the element of former course of dealings so pressed upon us in argument.\nIt is to be observed that the evidence of the respondents' witness already referred to, in answer to the 6th question of cross-examination, states that\nduring the business connection between plaintiffs and defendant part of the goods supplied were addressed and delivered at Halifax and part at Truro.\nThe case of Coombs v. Bristol & Exeter Railway Co.[33] seems to be conclusive on the point. The purchaser under a verbal agreement to buy of the vendor all the whalebone he could procure at a certain price to be sent by a particular railway, the purchaser agreeing to pay the carriage, it was held that the purchaser could not sue as consignee because the contract was void as within the Statute of Frauds and no title had passed.\nThe distinction urged here that at common law the contract was good notwithstanding the absence of writing or other requirement of the statute and because the railway could not invoke the statute as it would be presumed the title had passed, was urged and considered there.\nIt was pointed out in answer in the judgment delivered that the statute expressly says that the contract shall not be good.\nThere the obvious distinction is also pointed out between such cases, and the cases where, the contract being in writing and therefore valid, the consignee had been held entitled to sue the carrier for the loss of the goods.\nAlderton v. Archer[34], and Taylor v. Jones[35], are instructive as tests of where a contract is to be held as made when signed in one place and sued upon in another, or the converse case of a signature to a letter ordering, that was only accepted, as in one alternative here, by delivery of the goods ordered at the place where the letter was written.\nOn the whole I see no reason to doubt that in any way one can look at this claim of the respondents the contract was made and performed in Nova Scotia, and that being void when so made there the appellant should succeed.\nThe appeal ought, therefore, to be allowed with costs and the action be dismissed with costs of the appeal and in all the courts below.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014The principal question on this appeal is whether or not the goods, for which the bills sued upon were accepted, were sold in Nova Scotia by the plaintiffs, they having no license as required by the provincial law, or whether the sale was made in Glasgow, Scotland.\nThe goods having been received by the appellant, and he having accepted the bills therefor drawn upon him by the respondents for the price, it was for him, when now refusing to pay for them, to make out his defence by clear evidence that the sale was void, having been made in Nova Scotia.\nI am of opinion that he has not done so, and that the judgment appealed from is quite right.\nThe plaintiffs were distillers and dealers in whisky, and carry on their business in Glasgow, Scotland, and the defendant is resident and does business at Truro, in Nova Scotia. The plaintiffs had agents at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, named Eager & Son, whose authority was limited to the receiving and transmitting of orders for goods, but having no authority to bind the plaintiffs by accepting them. The orders for the goods in question were received by Eager & Son and transmitted to the plaintiffs. Of these there were three, the first in March, the second in April and the third in May, 1903. The respective shipments were made on the 26th March, the 30th April and the 16th May. The orders were sent by cable. These cables were printed in the case, in cypher, without translation, and we have no means of ascertaining their purport. It appears, however, that the orders were for the specified quantities of goods to be shipped to the defendant at Truro with the required number of capsules and labels, on usual terms and shipping instructions. The goods were shipped according to instructions, freight prepaid, and bills of lading taken, no doubt consigning the goods to the defendant. A bill was drawn for the price of the goods, including the freight, and a small charge for the bill of lading, and, finally, a bill of exchange was drawn on the defendant for the whole and accepted by him.\nNow, I think the effect of all this was, in each case, a sale of the goods to the defendant at Glasgow; that the moment the goods were thus shipped the property therein passed to the purchaser, and the sale became complete.\nIt is said that the purchaser had a right to inspect the goods on arrival, and to reject them. No doubt, if the goods were not the goods ordered, he could reject. Otherwise not.\nIn Brogden v. Metropolitan Railway Co.[36] Lord Blackburn says:\nBut I have always believed the law to be this, that when an offer is made to another party, and in that offer there is a request, express or implied, that he must signify his acceptance by doing some particular thing, then, as soon as he does that thing, he is bound. If a man sent an offer abroad, saying, \"I wish to know whether you will supply me with goods at such and such a price, and, if you agree to that, you must ship the first cargo as soon as you get this letter,\" there can be no doubt that, as soon as the cargo was shipped, the contract would be complete and, if the cargo went to the bottom of the sea, it would go to the bottom of the sea at the risk of the orderer.\nIt is said, however, that there is no evidence that the defendants' orders were in writing or conformed to the Statute of Frauds and that, therefore, there was no sale of these goods until they were accepted and received by the defendant at Truro.\nI think that is not the effect of the evidence. The defendants lived and did their business at Truro; Eager & Son were at Halifax. The defendant in his evidence says:\nAll business done with the plaintiffs was done through him (Eager). I did it all. All our orders were given to Eager, either at his office or man at Halifax. These two letters are from Eager\u2014M1 and M2. I received the goods referred to in them and the drafts sued on * * * were for these goods.\nThe letters referred to are written from Halifax and addressed to the defendant at Truro. The first says: We (Eager & Son) have received from your Halifax office the following order for 10 one-quart casks of Gaelic with the required number of capsules for shipment on through bill of lading to Truro, N.S. We have forwarded the order to Messrs. The Craigellachie Glenlivet Distillery Co.\nThe other says:\nWe have forwarded your memos to the following firms asking them to ship to you, etc., etc.\nI think the fair inference from the defendants' evidence and from these letters is that the orders referred to were in the form of letters from the defendant, duly signed by him, and which were transmitted to the plaintiffs and the effect of which is stated in these two letters of acknowledgment, marked M1 and M2.\nIn another passage of his testimony, the defendant says:\nThe goods for the earlier draft were ordered from our Halifax office. The order, though given in Halifax, I think was given from Truro to our man in Halifax. All the orders for the goods in question were ordered from company's office in Halifax or by letter from Bigelow & Hood, Truro, to Eager. 1 cannot tell which method was employed in these instances.\nI think it would be entirely contrary to usage and experience to suppose that these orders were not in writing and signed by the defendant.\nThen, it is said that the sale was made in Halifax, inasmuch as the acceptance of the defendant's order was made through Eager, and the evidence of Mr. Holm, a director of the plaintiff company, is relied on, in which he says:\nI say the contract for the sale of said goods was made by defendant tendering the order to the plaintiffs' agents for transmission by them (the agents) to the plaintiffs in Glasgow, and by the plaintiffs' acceptance in writing, conveyed through their agents in Halifax. The goods were sold in Glasgow, Scotland. This is not contradicted either by the defendant or by Eager, and, no doubt, if the sale in question was completed as thus described, it must be held to have been made in Halifax, for there could be no completion while the acceptance of the orders was still in the hands of the plaintiffs' agent and uncommunicated to the defendant. There is, however, no such acceptance in writing produced or proved by the defendant in relation to either of the three shipments in question.\nWe have seen that the orders were transmitted to the plaintiffs by cable, and it also appears that the shipments were made promptly. The first order was on the 21st of March; shipment, 26th March. The second order, 28th April; shipment, 30th April. And the defendant says the order for the shipment of 16th May was given about that date. Now, if what Mr. Holm speaks of as acceptance of orders in writing was transmitted by letter, it could not possibly have been received or conveyed to the defendant until after the goods had been shipped and after the property in them had passed to the defendant by the shipment. On the other hand, even if the acceptance had reached the defendant before the goods had been shipped, still the acceptance would pass no property. The sale would not be complete until goods of the kind sought to be purchased had been appropriated to the contract.\nWhat the statute, section 86, enacts, is that \"No person shall sell * * * any liquor * * * without * * * license.\" Until the goods were shipped there was no sale. There was or may have been an agreement for the sale of a named quantity, but there was no sale of liquor, and, therefore, no completed offence. And the sale must be taken to have been made where the goods were when the property passed from the plaintiffs to the defendant, and that was when they were appropriated to the contract at Glasgow.\nBut, even if there had been no signed orders given by the defendant, a verbal contract of sale is not void, but is good, if followed by acceptance and receipt of the goods.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the appellant's first ground of appeal wholly fails.\nBut the appellant relies on another ground, that the goods were sold for the purpose of enabling the appellant to re-sell the same in Nova Scotia contrary to law.\nI think the vague evidence on which it is sought to support this proposition is wholly insufficient, and I agree with the reasons given by the learned judges in the courts below on this point.\nThe appellant also placed some reliance on section 173 of the \"Liquor License Act,\" but that section merely makes it unlawful for a licensee to sell to an unlicensed person if he knows that it is purchased for the purpose of re-selling.\nThe appeal must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.

VII. c. 97 (N.S.).\nA municipality passed a resolution by which it agreed to pay for lands required for the right of way, station grounds, sidings and other purposes of a railway as shewn upon a plan filed under the provisions of the general railway Act. At the time of the resolution there were four such plans filed, each shewing a portion of the land proposed to be taken for these purposes and including, in the aggregate, a greater area than could be expropriated for right of way and station grounds under the provisions of the Acts applicable to the undertaking of the railway company. The Legislature passed an Act confirming such resolution. To an action by the owner of the land taken, on an award fixing the value of that in excess of what could be so expropriated, the corporation pleaded no liability on account of such excess and also, that there was no specific plan on file describing the land.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (38 N.S. Rep. 76) that the first defence failed because of the Act confirming the resolution and, as to the second, that the four plans should be read together and considered to be the plan referred to in such resolution.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Fraser by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs. The municipal corporation of the County of Inverness, N.S., passed a resolution, in January, 1902, by which it agreed to aid the construction of a railway by providing and paying for lands, at Broad Cove Mines, required by the railway company for right of way, station grounds, sidings or other railway purposes as included on a plan on file under the provisions of the Acts by which the company had authority to expropriate lands for the purposes of their undertaking. This resolution was confirmed and declared binding upon the municipality by a special statute, 3 Edw. VII. ch. 97 (N.S.). At the time when the resolution was passed there were four such plans filed, as complying with the terms of the general railway Act, each shewing portions of the lands so required; they were supplementary and complementary to each other and, taken together, shewed the whole of the land taken from the plaintiff (about fifty-one acres) in respect of which the present controversy arose. Upon an arbitration two awards were made; the first in regard to the ground occupied by the permanent way and station building, about seven acres, being the maximum which could be expropriated for such purposes under the Nova Scotia general railway statutes; and the second for the remainder of the lands, about forty-four acres, taken from the plaintiff for terminal purposes of the railway at Broad Cove Mines.\nThe municipality refused to pay the amount of the second award on the ground that the area thus taken was in excess of the quantity of land which might be expropriated under the statutes applicable to the railway, and that no such area being shewn upon any specified plan it, consequently, was not included in the reference made to the plan mentioned in the resolution. An action to recover the amount of this second award was maintained at the trial by Mr. Justice Fraser, and his decision was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from.\nNewcombe K.C. and A. A. Mackay, for the appellant.\nMellish K.C. and H. Y. MacDonald, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDAVIES J.\u2014I think this case turns entirely upon the meaning of the resolution passed by the Municipality of Inverness in January, 1902, and which was subsequently, in 1903, confirmed and made law by the Legislature of Nova Scotia.\nThe previous filing of the plans by the railway company may not have operated to pass the title of the whole fifty-one acres of McIsaac's land, attempted to be expropriated by the railway company, by reason of the limitations imposed upon this mode of expropriation by the general railway Act. I do not find it necessary to express any opinion on this point. But, when the statute of 1903 was passed confirming the municipal resolution and making it a part of the statute law of the province, the question is reduced to the meaning of that resolution and enactment and whether or not they provided for and included the lands of the respondent which the company had clearly attempted to expropriate and take.\nAs to the actual taking, surveying and fencing of the fifty-one acres there is no doubt, and as to the fyling of a plan by the company, shewing the whole fifty-one acres to have been taken many months before the resolution was passed, there is no dispute. The only question argued at length before us was whether this plan so filed could be considered as within the specific terms of the resolution.\nFour distinct plans had been filed, and I have no difficulty in acceding to the argument of Mr. MacDonald, adopting, on this point, the judgment of Fraser J., that the whole four plans must be read together as they are capable of being read, each being in some respect supplementary and complementary to the other, and together constituting the plan referred to in the resolution as the railway plan on file. If this is done and the enactment of the resolution construed, as it must be, as a statutory compact, binding alike on the company and the municipality, then all doubt as to the quantity of plaintiff's land taken is at an end.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Jas.

(dissenting).\u2014Under the circumstances, the order in this case ought to be treated as having been made upon the date when judgment upon the application was reserved by the judge. Upon the merits, the appeal should be allowed as the commissioners had no jurisdiction in the absence of proper notices as required by the twenty-second section of the \"Marsh Act,\" R.S.N.S. 1900, ch. 66.\nPer Davies J.\u2014The statute allows any person aggrieved by the proceedings of the commissioners to remove the same into the Supreme Court by certiorari; the claim for the writ on the ground of jurisdiction was either abandoned or unfounded; and the statutory writ could not issue after the six months had expired.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], setting aside an order made by Mr. Justice Graham, on the application of the appellants, directing that a writ of certiorari should issue to remove into the said court the record and proceedings of the Board of Commissioners for the Trecothic Marsh assessing a rate upon the lands of the appellants for expenses incurred in the drainage and dyking of the marsh.\nThe rate in question was made by the commissioners under the authority of the \"Marsh Act,\" R.S. N.S., 1900, ch. 66, which gives power to commissioners appointed under its provisions to levy rates for the cost of the works upon the proprietors of lands interested in the drainage and dykes. Section 22 of the Act imposes the condition that, in cases where it is necessary or expedient to borrow money to carry out the works, notice should be given to the proprietors before undertaking the expense. The 74th section provides for a review of the proceedings of the commissioners upon certiorari, on the application of any proprietor considering himself aggrieved, but forbids the granting of any such writ of certiorari except within six months next after the initiation of the proceedings or notice that they are being taken.\nThe company applied for an order to have the record and proceedings removed into the Supreme Court, by way of certiorari, within the time prescribed, but the judge reserved his judgment upon the application and made the order for the issue of the writ only some days after its expiration. The judgment now appealed from set aside the order upon the merits of the case, holding that the assessment upon the lands of the appellant had been properly imposed. The questions at issue upon the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. and Sangster for the appellants.\nNewcombe K.C. and Mellish K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014In this case a majority of the court have come to the conclusion that the appeal be dismissed upon the ground that the order granting the writ of certiorari at the instance of the appellant company was issued after the expiration of six calendar months contrary to section 74 of the Act in question, which decrees that any proprietor aggrieved by any proceeding of a commissioner may remove the same by writ of certiorari into the Supreme Court, but that no such writ shall be granted except within six calendar months next after such proceeding was taken, or the proprietor had notice that it was taken.\nI would not dissent from the proposition that, after the six months, the jurisdiction to issue the writ was gone, and that the judge in this case was functus officio, if the demand for a certiorari had not been based upon the want of jurisdiction in the commissioners. Threadgill v. Platt[2]; Credit Co. Ltd. v. Arkansas Central Ry. Co.[3]; per Strong J. in Ontario & Quebec Ry. Co. v. Marcheterre[4]; Canadian Mutual Loan and Investment Co. v. Lee[5].\nI would also assent to the proposition that the maxim actus curiae neminem gravabit cannot be applied so as to confer a jurisdiction that has been expressly taken away by statute. Cumber v. Wane[6]. I also agree that, where the time has expired, a court cannot give itself jurisdiction by antedating its judgment and ordering it to be entered nunc pro tunc. That would clearly be overriding the statute and defeating the intention of the law-giver. A court could not so indefinitely extend its jurisdiction in opposition to the law.\nI would think in this case, however, that the writ of certiorari was rightly issued on the ground that a statute taking away the writ, like this one does, after the six months, has no application when the judgment or proceedings of an inferior tribunal are impeached, as here, for want of jurisdiction in that tribunal.\nI will, however, not dissent from the judgment dismissing the appeal, as I am of opinion that the appellants' grounds of complaint against the assessment in question are unfounded. It is with great hesitation that I would, on a statute of this nature, interfere with the conclusion of the provincial court.\nI deem it inexpedient to review here the various questions raised by the appellants as, under the circumstances, any expression of opinion by me thereon would be obiter.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs. GIROUARD J. (dissenting).\nAs I understand this appeal two questions present themselves; First: Was the writ of certiorari granted within the prescribed time? 2ndly: Were the commissioners acting within their jurisdiction?\nThe powers of these commissioners are defined in the \"Marsh Act.\" ch. 66, of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1900, which deals with those large and valuable tracts of land in Nova Scotia which have been reclaimed from the sea by means of dykes since the days of the French Acadians. Commissioners were appointed and levied a rate upon the proprietors interested, among others the Dominion Cotton Mills Co., now appellants. They applied for a writ of certiorari under section 74 of the said statute. Sub-section 2 contains, however, the following limitation:\nNo such writ shall be granted except within six calendar months next after such proceeding was had or taken, or the proprietor had notice that it was had or taken.\nBefore the expiration of the six months, the appellants applied for the granting of the writ of certiorari to a judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, as provided by the Act, but his Lordship took the case en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 and granted the writ after the six months had expired. No objection was raised in the two courts below, and for the first time it is raised in this court.\nI do not look upon it as affecting the jurisdiction of the court of first instance, but as a mere matter of procedure which could be and was in fact waived. At common law, the court of first instance could always issue a writ of certiorari to bring before it the proceedings of an inferior court like that of those commissioners. Its jurisdiction was not created by the \"Marsh Act,\" it was simply limited, and if the parties interested do not in proper time take advantage of this limitation they must suffer for it. The majority of this court is of opinion that the objection is well taken, but, with due respect, I cannot accede to that decision. I respectfully submit that it is contrary to the well-settled jurisprudence of this country and of this court. Attorney-General v. Scott[7]; Couture v. Bouchard[8]; Danaher v. Peters[9]; St. James Election Case[10]; The Queen v. Justices of County of London[11].\nI will content myself with making a short quotation from the decision of this court in Danaher v. Peters. In that case the statute was imperative, as in this case:\nAll applications for a license, etc. shall be taken into consideration etc. not later than the first day of April.\nIt was held that licenses applied for before, but granted after, that period were not invalid. To decide otherwise would be simply a denial of justice. The appellants were within their rights when they applied within the six months, and if the judge chose to keep the case before him after that period, either one day, or several days, or several weeks, or several months, the appellants should not suffer for it, as was held in the Attorney-General v. Scott (1):\nIn a case like this, parties cannot be prejudiced by the delay of the court in rendering judgment which should be treated as having been given on the day that the case was taken en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9,\nAnd, with regard to prescription, I may add that it is suspended from the day the court or judge is duly seized of the subject matter. Having taken this view of the first question raised I now come to the merits. I am of the opinion that under section 22 of the \"Marsh Act,\" the commissioners could not proceed, as they knew that it would be necessary to borrow money for the purpose of paying for the expenses of the work. The following are the words in the said section, par. 1:\nAnd in all cases in which the work is such that it will be necessary or expedient to borrow money for the purpose of paying for the expenses of such work, he shall give notice to the proprietors of his intention to execute such work one month before commencing the same.\nHe is bound, then, to provide the clerk with a description of the proposed work and of the land proposed to be benefited, and an estimate of the cost of the work, and upon that, within a month the proprietors may signify their assent or dissent in writing, and if this is not done the commissioners cannot proceed any further. It is admitted that this condition precedent for the jurisdiction of the commissioners was not complied with, and for that reason the writ of certiorari should be granted, and finally all the proceedings of the said commissioners set aside.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014While I agree that this appeal must be dismissed on the ground that the certiorari was not granted until after the expiration of the six months prescribed by statute, I do not wish to be considered as expressing any opinion upon the legality or otherwise of the proceedings impeached, excepting in so far as they invoke the question of jurisdiction.\nThe grounds upon which the application was made were many and various. Two of them only raised the question of jurisdiction. One of these was that the lands sought to be taxed were not marsh lands within the meaning of the Act, and the other that the work done for which the rate was levied was done by persons purporting to act as commissioners in charge who had no authority or jurisdiction. On both of these grounds the judge to whom the application was made refused to grant the writ. No appeal was taken from that refusal by the Dominion Cotton Mills Co. The second ground was not argued before us, evidently having been abandoned after the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the decision of the trial judge upon it. The first ground, however, as to the lands not being marsh lands at all was argued by Mr. Ritchie. I do not stop to inquire whether, not having appealed from the refusal of the judge to grant the writ on this ground, the point was open to him upon this appeal. It is sufficient to say that I fully concur with the judgment of the court below upon it approving the decision of the trial judge.\nAll questions of jurisdiction being removed those remaining were questions of the regularity and justice or otherwise of the proceedings. First, did the 74th section of the Act prohibiting the granting of a writ under the statute after the expiration of six months apply to this application; secondly, if it did not apply, were there merits justifying the granting of the writ under the statute?\nOn the first point the question whether the legislature intends a provision of a statute to be imperative or directory must depend in each case upon the language used and upon the scope and object of the statute.\nMost of the decisions, therefore, on other acts, to which our attention was called, or to which we have referred, furnish us with little, if any, assistance, and do not affect the decision which I have reached.\nThe case of The Queen v. Justices of County of London[12], is perhaps the strongest in respondent's favour. But, as observed by Kay L.J. at p. 496, the section 42, sub-section 13 of the Act there under consideration,\nonly incidently mentioned the day before which all appeals should be determined. There is no express enactment that all appeals should be determined before that day nor that any appeal not then determined shall not be determined at all.\nThe 74th section of the Act, chapter 66 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1900, the meaning of which we have to determine, is as follows:\n1. If any proprietor is aggrieved by any proceeding of a commissioner or commissioners or of any person purporting to act under the provisions of this chapter, he may remove such proceeding into the Supreme Court by means of a writ of certiorari.\n2. No such writ shall be granted except within six months next after such proceeding was had or taken or the proprietor had notice that it was had or taken.\n3. No such writ shall be granted until the proprietor has given the security required upon issuing writs of certiorari in other cases.\n4. Any proceedings so removed into court may be examined by the court or a judge, and such determination made as is proper.\n5. The court or judge may from time to time remit the proceedings to the commissioner, or other person purporting to act under the provisions of this chapter, for reconsideration, with all necessary directions, and the same shall be so reconsidered.\nHere the application for the writ was made before the six months had expired, but the writ was not granted or allowed till after the expiration of the prescribed period.\nComplete supervisory powers were by the fourth and fifth sections given to the court or a judge, and the amplest provision made for obtaining a proper determination by the court, for correcting irregularities in the procedure and for protecting the interests of any proprietor who thought himself aggrieved by any proceedings of the commissioners.\nBut it is obvious that the legislature thought it necessary to impose a time limit upon the exercise of these powers by the court otherwise there would never be finality in the proceedings or that complete confidence which would enable the commissioners to proceed with heavy expenditures or to borrow the necessary capital to carry out contemplated improvements. The sub-section, it will be observed, does not prescribe any time within which the application for the writ must be made, but one after which the writ must not be granted.\nHaving regard to the whole scope, operation and intention of the Act and of the peremptory and negative words of sub-section 2, I am of opinion (questions of jurisdiction not being involved) that it was not in the power of the judge to grant the writ applied for after the six months had expired.\nI would, therefore, dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellants applied to Mr. Justice Graham of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for a writ of certiorari which he granted on the 11th November, 1904, to remove into said court a certain record of a rate made on the 21st of March, 1904, by a Board of Commissioners for Trecothic Marsh purporting to have been made pursuant to power conferred upon them by \"The Marsh Act\" of Nova Scotia.\nUpon appeal to the said court en banc the order granting said writ was set aside. From this the appellants have appealed to this court, and amongst other answers made to such appeal is the objection that section 74, sub-section 1, of said Act, giving the right to such writ is restricted by sub-section 2, as follows:\nNo such writ shall be granted except within six calendar months next after such proceeding was had or taken, or the proprietor had notice that it was had or taken,\nand that notice of the rate was given appellants on 30th March, 1904; and, therefore, in either alternative of this sub-section the six months had expired before the writ was actually granted.\nIt seems that the notice of application for writ was within, and the time named therein for return of the notice was well within, the six months in question.\nBy reason of the necessary enlargement of the motion it would seem the motion was not heard until the 30th of September, 1904, as appears from the filing of the appellants' affidavits in reply.\nIt was hardly possible for the learned judge under such circumstances to have heard and considered all the material before him, and now before us, and have given a well-considered judgment in a rather complicated matter within the time.\nIf the time for judgment granting the writ fell beyond the limit of six months allowed, it seems clear that the appellants have only themselves to blame and cannot shove responsibility for it upon the court.\nIt seems, therefore, as if the case fell within the line of cases, where the applicant has failed in so many cases, because he had not complied with the terms, that the legislature had prescribed for him, to exercise a right within.\nIndeed the appellants would seem to have very little excuse, for they must be taken to have known through their manager and otherwise, I infer, that such expenditure at their door was being made upon these works, as would require from them, as well as others, pretty heavy contributions for the work in question, and that money would need to be borrowed to repay such expenditure, and that the whole proceedings were at least highly irregular and possibly beyond the jurisdiction of the commissioners, and that in all probability the commissioners were relying upon that notice and probable knowledge, of the appellants, without any very distinct protest or opposition from them.\nThe initial step, to go on with the work, on a scale that, after repeated failures, must have plainly meant, to ordinary business men, a borrowing of money, made it the duty as soon as that step was placed on record as it was by the commissioners in May, 1902, to object and resist, if they intended ever to do so, the commissioners so proceeding without jurisdiction. That was a proceeding that the appellants could have attacked by means of a writ of certiorari, or other obvious and effective means the law gives those concerned to keep public authorities, such as these commissioners, within the limits fixed by law for the discharge of their duties.\nWhether all this and more that was done may amount in law to such acquiescence on the part of appellants as to be an answer to them challenging here or elswhere this burthensome tax I need not inquire or say here.\nIt seems to be a very complete answer, however, to the case of hardship if that alone could, as it cannot, avail to help in the construction of this statute.\nIt is to indicate, that in my opinion there is not the slightest reason for such appellants urging that they might have been entitled to claim judgment some time before midnight of the 30th September in a case argued on such date, that I refer to these facts. The case falls well within the principles laid down by Lord Esher in The Queen v. Justices of County of London[13], at p. 488. And the giving effect to the objection that appellants were too late does not involve any interpretation of the statute, in such a way as to lead to manifest public mischief, such as Bowen L.J., at p. 492 of the same case submits must, if possible, be avoided in trying to interpret statutes.\nThe sub-section 2 which I quote above is of the most imperative character possible, and prohibited the granting of the writ, at the time it was done, unless some such principle as the last named judge adverts to, becomes applicable, as I conceive it did not under the facts in this case.\nWhen we consider the scope of the Act, the manifest intention to prevent appeals of any kind, the great importance of avoiding delay and enabling the financial arrangements in such cases to be completed at the earliest possible date, and that the entire working of the Act rests upon the commissioners being kept within the lines of power given them, and so ready a means as the writ of certiorari is expressly given for that purpose, in such wide comprehensive terms, we see the need for the imperative terms of the Act, and need for exacting compliance with them.\nIf the acts done by the commissioners had not in themselves any efficacy in law and have not acquired efficacy by reason of the acquiescence of the appellants as evidenced by their acts and omissions, then there is less reason to look for another than the plain ordinary meaning of sub-section 2 in order to prevent them producing manifest absurdity or a denial of natural justice. On the other hand if the things complained of were technical rather than going to the root of the matter then no harm done. Maxwell on Statutes, p. 9, says:\nSo if an Act provides that convictions shall be made within a certain period after the commission of the offence, a conviction made after the lapse of that period would be bad, although the prosecution had been begun within the time limited, and the case had been adjourned to a day beyond it, with the consent, or even at the instance, of the defendant (a). So, when an Act gives to persons aggrieved by an order of justice a certain period after the making of the order for appealing to the Quarter Sessions, it has been held that the time runs from the day on which the order was verbally pronounced, not from the day of its service on the aggrieved person.\nWhat he thus says is borne out by at least two of the cases, Rex v. Bellamy[14], and Rex v. Tolley[15].\nThe more recent case of Re Nottawasaga and Simcoe[16] in the Court of Appeal for Ontario, seems much in point as giving effect to the word \"shall\" under an interpretation Act similar to that governing its use in Nova Scotia legislation and in relation to the action or want of action on the part of a judge relative to the cognate matters of assessment in Ontario.\nThese authorities seem to go much further than we need to go in the disposal of this appeal.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nI am in doubt on the question of costs because it seems the point now taken and given effect to was not taken below or here until taken in argument of the appeal though something like it is raised in another sense in respondents' factum.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I concur in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.

The respondent is a company operating an electric tramway in said city. The action is brought to recover damages for injuries received by appellant on the 15th of February, 1904, by reason of being thrown out of his sleigh in crossing respondents' track on Cunard Street in said city. The writ was issued on the 27th day of June, 1904.\nAt the time of the accident there was considerable snow on the street, the deep snow having been cleared by respondents of their track, leaving steep banks on each side.\nThe rules in the schedule to respondents' Act of incorporation (Nova Scotia statutes, 1895, ch. 107) are by the Act made part of same and Rule 9 is as follows:\n\"The company may remove snow and ice from its tracks, or any portion of them, to enable it to operate its cars, provided, however, that in case said snow and ice shall be removed from its track, it shall be its duty to level it to a uniform depth to be determined by the city engineer, and to such a distance each side of the track as the said engineer shall direct, or to remove from the street all snow and ice disturbed, ploughed, or thrown out by the plough, leveller or tools of the company within forty-eight hours of the fall or disturbance of said snow or ice, if the city engineer shall direct.\"\nThe action was tried at Halifax before the judge in equity (Mr. Justice Graham), with a jury, on the 21st and 22nd days of November, 1904. The questions submitted to the jury and their answers thereto are as follows:\n1. Q. Was the accident caused by snow removed by defendant company from its track and left on the street without being levelled in accordance with a determination of the city engineer? A. Yes.\n2. Q. Had the snow thrown from the defendants' track at the crossing in question been removed and levelled by the defendant company to the satisfaction of the city engineer at the time of the accident? A. No.\n3. Q. Did the defendant company exercise reasonable care in regard to the condition in which it left the street at the crossing in question when disturbing snow to clear its track? A. No.\n4. Q. Other than the amount of a compensation for the service of the medical practitioners at what sum do you estimate the damages? A. Seven thousand, one hundred and twenty-two dollars and forty cents.\n5. Q. What sum do you allow as a reasonable compensation for the services of the medical practitioners? A. ($250.00) Two hundred and fifty dollars.\nCounsel for the respondent moved on the trial after the verdict was rendered for judgment irrespective of the findings, but the learned trial judge decided that appellant was entitled to judgment for the damages assessed ($7,342.40) and costs.\nThe respondents moved for a new trial and also appealed from the decision of the trial judge refusing to enter judgment for respondent.\nThe motion and appeal were heard by a court consisting of Meagher, Fraser and Russell JJ., and the decision of the majority of the court was read by Russell J., and was to the effect that the appeal be dismissed, but the motion for new trial allowed and all the findings of the jury set aside. Meagher J. dissented from the decision on the motion.\nFrom the judgment ordering a new trial the present appeal is asserted. The defendants took a cross-appeal claiming a nonsuit as moved for in the court below. Borden K.C. and W. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellant.\nNewcombe K.C. and Mellish K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDAVIES J.\u2014We are all of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia set aside the findings of the jury and directed a new trial to be had. and in view of that I will abstain from making any remarks upon the case or the evidence at the former trial which could possibly prejudice either party.\nThe trial judge directed judgment to be entered upon the findings of the jury. He did not profess to supplement their findings by any additional finding of fact of his own. We are therefore, relieved from considering the question raised at the argument whether he could under the \"Judicature Act of Nova Scotia,\" in a case such as this, where a jury had been applied for and granted and specific questions put to them, supplement their findings on these questions by findings of his own.\nI think the first question, in the form in which it was put, open to the criticism passed upon it by Russell J. in delivering the judgment of the court, and that it might well have misled the jury. I think also that the third question and answer are fatally defective because they do not shew any necessary connection between the general negligence found by the jury and the plaintiff's accident. Nor do I think that any such connection could be fairly and necessarily inferred from all the findings together.\nIt is elementary law that a defendant cannot be held liable for any act of negligence he may have been guilty of unless such negligence be the direct and proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury.\nIn a case such as this the jury should be asked specifically to state what the negligence of the defendant company was which caused the plaintiff's injury. Mere general findings of negligence, unless such negligence is shewn and found to be the direct and proximate cause of the injuries complained of, are quite insufficient to support a judgment.\nThe defendant company has the statutory right or privilege of removing snow and ice from its tracks to enable it to operate its cars, and Rule 9, which is comprised together with other rules in a schedule attached to and made part of the company's charter, gives the city engineer full power to determine whether the snow so removed from the car tracks shall be taken away from the street altogether or levelled to a uniform depth for such a distance each side of the track as the engineer may determine.\nBut apart altogether from this rule, but at the same time not inconsistent with it, there is a duty cast by law upon the Electric Company to carry out their statutory privilege in the first instance in a reasonable and proper way, and without negligence. If after or during a snow storm or at any time they remove snow and ice from their track and throw it upon the part of the highway adjoining the track in a careless and negligent way, or leave it piled or heaped or placed upon the highway in a negligent way or manner, and an accident is thereby caused to any person lawfully using the highway the company would be clearly liable. This, of course, would be subject to proof of contributory negligence on the part of the injured person and the finding that their negligence in the way and manner of placing the snow and ice upon the roadway was the direct and proximate cause of the injury. This is a matter entirely apart from any determination of the engineer as respects the uniform levelling of the snow and ice or its entire removal.\nThe questions that naturally arise in this case are: Was there such negligence as I have spoken of, and was it the direct cause of the plaintiff's injuries? and also, in case these questions are found in the negative: Did the engineer come to a determination with reference to the disposition of the snow and ice on this roadway in question and did he communicate it to the company? If so, did the company carry out his orders in a reasonable, careful and proper way? If not, in what respect did they fail to obey the orders or negligently carry them out, and was this failure or negligence the direct cause of plaintiff's injuries?\nIf the dangerous condition of the street at the time of the accident arose from other causes than the negligence of the defendant company, such, for instance, as the street traffic in changing climatic conditions causing ridges of snow and ice, or the action of the adjoining householders in throwing snow and ice from the sidewalk into the street, of course the company could not be held liable.\nThese are questions a jury is peculiarly qualified to answer and I have no doubt, with the experience gained in the first trial, questions will be framed in such a way as to enable a satisfactory and final disposition of the case to be made.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Henry C. Borden.\nSolicitor for the respondents: W. H. Fulton.\n",
